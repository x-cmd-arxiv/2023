a key technology in autonomous driving and robotics. The current mainstream
approaches use either the perspective view retrieval perspective view (P2P)
paradigm or the equirectangular image retrieval equirectangular image (E2E)
paradigm. However, a natural and practical idea is that users only have
consumer-grade pinhole cameras to obtain query perspective images and retrieve
them in panoramic database images from map providers. To this end, we propose
PanoVPR, a sliding-window-based perspective-to-equirectangular (P2E) visual
place recognition framework, which eliminates feature truncation caused by hard
cropping by sliding windows over the whole equirectangular image and computing
and comparing feature descriptors between windows. In addition, this unified
framework allows for directly transferring the network structure used in
perspective-to-perspective (P2P) methods without modification. To facilitate
training and evaluation, we derive the pitts250k-P2E dataset from the pitts250k
and achieve promising results, and we also establish a P2E dataset in a
real-world scenario by a mobile robot platform, which we refer to YQ360. Code

  Information Bottleneck","25 pages; CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In practical scenarios where training data is limited, many predictive
signals in the data can be rather from some biases in data acquisition (i.e.,
less generalizable), so that one cannot prevent a model from co-adapting on
such (so-called) ""shortcut"" signals: this makes the model fragile in various
distribution shifts. To bypass such failure modes, we consider an adversarial
threat model under a mutual information constraint to cover a wider class of
perturbations in training. This motivates us to extend the standard information
bottleneck to additionally model the nuisance information. We propose an
autoencoder-based training to implement the objective, as well as practical
encoder designs to facilitate the proposed hybrid discriminative-generative
training concerning both convolutional- and Transformer-based architectures.
Our experimental results show that the proposed scheme improves robustness of
learned representations (remarkably without using any domain-specific
knowledge), with respect to multiple challenging reliability measures. For
example, our model could advance the state-of-the-art on a recent challenging
OBJECTS benchmark in novelty detection by $78.4\% \rightarrow 87.2\%$ in AUROC,
while simultaneously enjoying improved corruption, background and (certified)

decrease model performance when such data are not available during

it suffers from catastrophic forgetting, causing a significant drop in
performance on previously observed domains. Despite recent progress in reducing
catastrophic forgetting, its causes and effects remain obscure. Therefore, we
study how the representations of semantic segmentation models are affected
during domain-incremental learning in adverse weather conditions. Our

is primarily caused by changes to low-level features in domain-incremental

factors for QSPEVE. These error analyses enable us to produce constant-factor
quantum resource estimates for both std-EVE and QSP-EVE across a variety of

discharge which undermines the behaviors of a range of applications in

continuum and kinetic simulation method is first proposed and implemented as an
alternative solution for flashover modeling, aiming for the prevention of the
unfavorable particle noises in PIC models. The 1D2V (one dimension in space,
two dimensions in velocity) kinetic simulation model is constructed. Modeling
setup, physical assumptions, and simulation algorithm are presented in detail,
and a comparison with the well-known secondary electron emission avalanche
(SEEA) analytical expression and existing PIC simulation is made. Obtained
kinetic simulation results are consistent with the analytical prediction, and
feature noise-free data of surface charge density as well as particle fluxes of
primary and secondary electrons. Discrepancies between the two simulation

method for predicting magnetic flux expulsion behavior of high purity niobium

conventional metallographic characterizations in conjunction with high spatial
resolution electron backscattered diffraction-orientation imaging microscopy
(EBSD-OIM), we found that the flux expulsion behavior of 1.3 GHz single cell
SRF Nb cavities is significantly associated with the grain growth of the Nb
material during heat treatment. Most of Nb grains rapidly grew during 900C heat
treatment, and likely full-recrystallized with 1000C HT. With comparison of the
magnetic flux expulsion ratio (Bsc/Bnc) at dT = 5 K, the flux expulsion
efficiency of the cavities increases along with increasing of grain size. Most
interestingly, 900C HT shows a roughly linear trend that suggests this
criterion could be used to predict appropriate heat treatment temperature for
sufficient flux expulsion behavior in SRF-grade Nb. This result would be used
to see if flux expulsion can be predicted by examining the materials coming
from the Nb vendor, prior to cavity fabrication.

provided to recognize a new class. Several recent studies exploit additional
semantic information, e.g. text embeddings of class names, to address the issue
of rare samples through combining semantic prototypes with visual prototypes.
However, these methods still suffer from the spurious visual features learned
from the rare support samples, resulting in limited benefits. In this paper, we
propose a novel Semantic Prompt (SP) approach for few-shot learning. Instead of
the naive exploitation of semantic information for remedying classifiers, we
explore leveraging semantic information as prompts to tune the visual feature
extraction network adaptively. Specifically, we design two complementary
mechanisms to insert semantic prompts into the feature extractor: one is to
enable the interaction between semantic prompts and patch embeddings along the
spatial dimension via self-attention, another is to supplement visual features
with the transformed semantic prompts along the channel dimension. By combining
these two mechanisms, the feature extractor presents a better ability to attend
to the class-specific features and obtains more generalized image
representations with merely a few support samples. Through extensive
experiments on four datasets, the proposed approach achieves promising results,
improving the 1-shot learning accuracy by 3.67% on average.

representing 3D scenes and images, and have been recently applied to encode

INR-based methods are limited to encoding a handful of short videos (e.g.,
seven 5-second videos in the UVG dataset) with redundant visual content,
leading to a model design that fits individual video frames independently and
is not efficiently scalable to a large number of diverse videos. This paper
focuses on developing neural representations for a more practical setup --
encoding long and/or a large number of videos with diverse visual content. We
first show that instead of dividing videos into small subsets and encoding them
with separate models, encoding long and diverse videos jointly with a unified
model achieves better compression results. Based on this observation, we
propose D-NeRV, a novel neural representation framework designed to encode
diverse videos by (i) decoupling clip-specific visual content from motion
information, (ii) introducing temporal reasoning into the implicit neural
network, and (iii) employing the task-oriented flow as intermediate output to
reduce spatial redundancies. Our new model largely surpasses NeRV and
traditional video compression techniques on UCF101 and UVG datasets on the
video compression task. Moreover, when used as an efficient data-loader, D-NeRV
achieves 3%-10% higher accuracy than NeRV on action recognition tasks on the
UCF101 dataset under the same compression ratios.

this article proposes to enhance our ability to recognise AI-generated images

mirrors the ten classes of the already available CIFAR-10 dataset with latent
diffusion which provides a contrasting set of images for comparison to real
photographs. The model is capable of generating complex visual attributes, such
as photorealistic reflections in water. The two sets of data present as a
binary classification problem with regard to whether the photograph is real or

Following hyperparameter tuning and the training of 36 individual network
topologies, the optimal approach could correctly classify the images with
92.98% accuracy. Finally, this study implements explainable AI via Gradient
Class Activation Mapping to explore which features within the images are useful
for classification. Interpretation reveals interesting concepts within the
image, in particular, noting that the actual entity itself does not hold useful

against the most vulnerable. NGOs and international organizations claim that
the poor are blamed for their situation, are more often associated with
criminal offenses than the wealthy strata of society and even incur criminal
offenses simply as a result of being poor. While no evidence has been found in
the literature that correlates poverty and overall criminality rates, this
paper offers evidence of a collective belief that associates both concepts.
This brief report measures the societal bias that correlates criminality with
the poor, as compared to the rich, by using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques in Twitter. The paper quantifies the level of crime-poverty bias in
a panel of eight different English-speaking countries. The regional differences
in the association between crime and poverty cannot be justified based on
different levels of inequality or unemployment, which the literature correlates
to property crimes. The variation in the observed rates of crime-poverty bias
for different geographic locations could be influenced by cultural factors and
the tendency to overestimate the equality of opportunities and social mobility
in specific countries. These results have consequences for policy-making and
open a new path of research for poverty mitigation with the focus not only on
the poor but on society as a whole. Acting on the collective bias against the
poor would facilitate the approval of poverty reduction policies, as well as
the restoration of the dignity of the persons affected.

these reconstructions lack explicit semantic information and are difficult to

semantically similar to the original ones. However, these images have
uncontrollable structural information such as position and orientation. To
address both of the aforementioned issues simultaneously, we propose a
two-stage image reconstruction model called MindDiffuser, utilizing Stable
Diffusion. In Stage 1, the VQ-VAE latent representations and the CLIP text
embeddings decoded from fMRI are put into the image-to-image process of Stable
Diffusion, which yields a preliminary image that contains semantic and
structural information. In Stage 2, we utilize the low-level CLIP visual

the two features in Stage 1 through backpropagation to align the structural
information. The results of both qualitative and quantitative analyses

inflation are non-minimally coupled to gravity or the gravitational sector is
extended, assumptions about the underlying gravitational degrees of freedom can
have substantial implications for the observational effects of inflation. We
examine this explicitly by discussing various compelling scenarios, such as
Higgs inflation with non-minimal coupling to gravity, Higgs inflation with
non-minimal derivative coupling, $\mathcal{R}^2$ inflation, and beyond. We also
comment on reheating in these models. Finally, as an application of the general
results of Palatini $\mathcal{R}^2$ inflation, we review a model of successful
quintessential inflation, where a single scalar field acts initially as the
inflaton and then becomes dynamical dark energy, in agreement will all
experimental constraints.

symmetry that holds only in a finite domain of space, can be either the result
of a self-organization process or a structural ingredient into a synthetically

construction, the implanted local symmetries strongly overlap the resulting
lattice possesses a dense skeleton of such symmetries. We proof this behaviour
on the basis of a class of local symmetry operations allowing us to conclude
upon the 'asymptotic' properties such as the final period, decomposition of the

the number of model parameters grows relative to the number of data, test error
drops as models grow ever larger into the highly overparameterized (data

theory on overfitting and has arguably underpinned the success of large models
in machine learning. This non-monotonic behavior of test loss depends on the
number of data, the dimensionality of the data and the number of model

explanation of why double descent occurs in an informal and approachable
manner, requiring only familiarity with linear algebra and introductory
probability. We provide visual intuition using polynomial regression, then
mathematically analyze double descent with ordinary linear regression and
identify three interpretable factors that, when simultaneously all present,
together create double descent. We demonstrate that double descent occurs on
real data when using ordinary linear regression, then demonstrate that double
descent does not occur when any of the three factors are ablated. We use this
understanding to shed light on recent observations in nonlinear models

measure applicable to realistic electron systems has been derived. In the
present work, we build on this key achievement with the ultimate goal of
guiding the development of quantum technologies. For this, we first elucidate
the process of entanglement swapping in electron systems such as atoms,
molecules or solid bodies. This clearly demonstrates the necessity of both the
reference to localized few-orbital subsystems and the implementation of the
number-parity superselection rule. Accordingly, in virtue of Wick's theorem, we
then provide a fully analytical study of the true physical entanglement between
sites in free electron chains. In that sense, we break the common paradigm of
restricting such analytical analyses to unitarily invariant settings, i.e.
bipartitions of the chain into rather impractical, macroscopically large
subsystems. We then upgrade this model to a hydrogen ring of interacting
electrons and construct the sought-after localized orbitals. For both systems,
we confirm the presence of long-distance entanglement, provided the filling
fractions are sufficiently low/high.

observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). This GRB has continuous
prompt emission lasting more than 600 seconds, afterglow visible in the \gbm
energy range (8 keV--40 MeV), and total energetics higher than any other burst
in the GBM sample. By using a variety of new and existing analysis techniques
we probe the spectral and temporal evolution of GRB 221009A. We find no
emission prior to the GBM trigger time (t0; 2022 October 9 at 13:16:59.99 UTC),
indicating that this is the time of prompt emission onset. The triggering pulse
exhibits distinct spectral and temporal properties suggestive of shock-breakout
with significant emission up to $\sim$15\,MeV. We characterize the onset of
external shock at \t0+600\,s and find evidence of a plateau region in the
early-afterglow phase which transitions to a slope consistent with \swift-XRT
afterglow measurements. We place the total energetics of GRB 221009A in context
with the rest of the GBM sample and find that this GRB has the highest total
isotropic-equivalent energy
($\textrm{E}_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}=1.0\times10^{55}$\,erg) and second highest
isotropic-equivalent luminosity
($\textrm{L}_{\gamma,\textrm{iso}}=9.9\times10^{53}$\,erg/s) based on redshift
of z = 0.151. These extreme energetics are what allowed GBMto observe the
continuously emitting central engine from the beginning of the prompt emission
phase through the onset of early afterglow.

effectively constrained to a subspace $V$ in the ambient input space

vulnerability depends on $\dim(V)$. In particular, we show that the adversarial

monotonically increasing function of $\epsilon (\frac{\dim(V)}{\dim

$\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} =1$, provided $p > 1$ (the case $p=1$ presents
additional subtleties which we analyze in some detail). This functional form
can be easily derived from a simple toy linear model, and as such our results
land further credence to arguments that adversarial examples are endemic to
locally linear models on high dimensional spaces.

that promise to bring low-power and low-latency inference to edge devices
through asynchronous and sparse processing. However, being temporal models,
SNNs depend heavily on expressive states to generate predictions on par with
classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). These states converge only after
long transient periods, and quickly decay without input data, leading to higher
latency, power consumption, and lower accuracy. This work addresses this issue
by initializing the state with an auxiliary ANN running at a low rate. The SNN
then uses the state to generate predictions with high temporal resolution until
the next initialization phase. Our hybrid ANN-SNN model thus combines the best
of both worlds: It does not suffer from long state transients and state decay
thanks to the ANN, and can generate predictions with high temporal resolution,
low latency, and low power thanks to the SNN. We show for the task of
event-based 2D and 3D human pose estimation that our method consumes 88% less
power with only a 4% decrease in performance compared to its fully ANN
counterparts when run at the same inference rate. Moreover, when compared to
SNNs, our method achieves a 74% lower error. This research thus provides a new
understanding of how ANNs and SNNs can be used to maximize their respective
benefits.

steady improvements in accuracy and efficiency of the models. In this work, we
introduce FastViT, a hybrid vision transformer architecture that obtains the
state-of-the-art latency-accuracy trade-off. To this end, we introduce a novel
token mixing operator, RepMixer, a building block of FastViT, that uses
structural reparameterization to lower the memory access cost by removing
skip-connections in the network. We further apply train-time
overparametrization and large kernel convolutions to boost accuracy and
empirically show that these choices have minimal effect on latency. We show
that - our model is 3.5x faster than CMT, a recent state-of-the-art hybrid
transformer architecture, 4.9x faster than EfficientNet, and 1.9x faster than
ConvNeXt on a mobile device for the same accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. At
similar latency, our model obtains 4.2% better Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet than
MobileOne. Our model consistently outperforms competing architectures across
several tasks -- image classification, detection, segmentation and 3D mesh
regression with significant improvement in latency on both a mobile device and
a desktop GPU. Furthermore, our model is highly robust to out-of-distribution
samples and corruptions, improving over competing robust models.

  https://junxuan-li.github.io/wildlight-website/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a practical photometric solution for the challenging
problem of in-the-wild inverse rendering under unknown ambient lighting. Our
system recovers scene geometry and reflectance using only multi-view images
captured by a smartphone. The key idea is to exploit smartphone's built-in
flashlight as a minimally controlled light source, and decompose image
intensities into two photometric components -- a static appearance corresponds
to ambient flux, plus a dynamic reflection induced by the moving flashlight.
Our method does not require flash/non-flash images to be captured in pairs.
Building on the success of neural light fields, we use an off-the-shelf method
to capture the ambient reflections, while the flashlight component enables
physically accurate photometric constraints to decouple reflectance and
illumination. Compared to existing inverse rendering methods, our setup is
applicable to non-darkroom environments yet sidesteps the inherent difficulties
of explicit solving ambient reflections. We demonstrate by extensive
experiments that our method is easy to implement, casual to set up, and
consistently outperforms existing in-the-wild inverse rendering techniques.
Finally, our neural reconstruction can be easily exported to PBR textured
triangle mesh ready for industrial renderers.

learning via leveraging contrastive learning over raw RGB-D frames and proves
its effectiveness on various downstream tasks. However, the trend of
large-scale unsupervised learning in 3D has yet to emerge due to two stumbling
blocks: the inefficiency of matching RGB-D frames as contrastive views and the
annoying mode collapse phenomenon mentioned in previous works. Turning the two
stumbling blocks into empirical stepping stones, we first propose an efficient
and effective contrastive learning framework, which generates contrastive views
directly on scene-level point clouds by a well-curated data augmentation
pipeline and a practical view mixing strategy. Second, we introduce
reconstructive learning on the contrastive learning framework with an exquisite
design of contrastive cross masks, which targets the reconstruction of point
color and surfel normal. Our Masked Scene Contrast (MSC) framework is capable
of extracting comprehensive 3D representations more efficiently and
effectively. It accelerates the pre-training procedure by at least 3x and still
achieves an uncompromised performance compared with previous work. Besides, MSC
also enables large-scale 3D pre-training across multiple datasets, which
further boosts the performance and achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning
results on several downstream tasks, e.g., 75.5% mIoU on ScanNet semantic

Vehicles (AV), but also makes them susceptible to backdoor attacks that can
result in traffic congestion or collisions. Backdoor functionality is typically
incorporated by contaminating training datasets with covert malicious data to
maintain high precision on genuine inputs while inducing the desired
(malicious) outputs for specific inputs chosen by adversaries. Current defenses
against backdoors mainly focus on image classification using image-based
features, which cannot be readily transferred to the regression task of
DRL-based AV controllers since the inputs are continuous sensor data, i.e., the
combinations of velocity and distance of AV and its surrounding vehicles. Our
proposed method adds well-designed noise to the input to neutralize backdoors.
The approach involves learning an optimal smoothing (noise) distribution to
preserve the normal functionality of genuine inputs while neutralizing
backdoors. By doing so, the resulting model is expected to be more resilient
against backdoor attacks while maintaining high accuracy on genuine inputs. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on a simulated traffic system
based on a microscopic traffic simulator, where experimental results showcase
that the smoothed traffic controller can neutralize all trigger samples and
maintain the performance of relieving traffic congestion

symmetries. In this work, we ask: to what extent is this infrared structure
present in BFSS? We find that all the salient features concerning the infrared

Moreover, we demonstrate that the dual statement of the soft graviton theorem

photospheres of ancient unevolved metal-poor stars. A significant fraction of
these stellar fossils is represented by stars known as Carbon-Enhanced
Metal-Poor (CEMP), $\rm [C/Fe]>+0.7$ and $\rm [Fe/H]<-2$, which are likely
imprinted by low-energy primordial supernovae. These CEMP stars are largely
observed in the Galactic halo and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, with values
reaching $\rm [C/Fe]=+4.5$. The Galactic bulge is predicted to host the oldest
stars, but it shows a striking dearth of CEMP stars with $\rm [C/Fe]\gtrsim
+2.0$. Here we explore the possible reasons for this anomaly by performing a
statistical analysis of the observations of metal-poor stars in combination
with the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM models. We suggest that the dearth of CEMP
stars with high $\rm [C/Fe]$ is not due to the low statistics of observed
metal-poor stars but is the result of the different formation process of the
bulge. $N$-body simulations show that the first star-forming halos which end up
in the bulge are characterized by the highest star-formation rates. These rates
enable the formation of rare massive first stars exploding as pair-instability
supernovae (PISNe), which wash out the signature of primordial faint
supernovae. We demonstrate that the mean $\rm [C/Fe]$ of first stars polluted
environments decreases with the increasing contribution of PISNe. We conclude
that the dearth of CEMP stars in the Galactic bulge indirectly probes the
existence of elusive PISNe, and propose a novel method which exploits this lack

Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies from the FIRE- 2 cosmological zoom-in simulations.
We quantify the relative importance of cosmological disk settling and
post-formation dynamical heating. We identify three eras: a Pre-Disk Era
(typically >8 Gyr ago), when stars formed on dispersion-dominated orbits; an
Early-Disk Era (~ 8 - 4 Gyr ago), when stars started to form on
rotation-dominated orbits but with high velocity dispersion, sigma_form; and a
Late-Disk Era (< 4 Gyr ago), when stars formed with low sigma_form. sigma_form
increased with time during the Pre-Disk Era, peaking ~ 8 Gyr ago, then
decreased throughout the Early-Disk Era as the disk settled and remained low
throughout the Late-Disk Era. By contrast, the velocity dispersion measured
today, sigma_now, increases monotonically with age because of stronger
post-formation heating for Pre-Disk stars. Importantly, most of sigma_now was
in place at formation, not added post-formation, for stars younger than ~ 10
Gyr. We compare the evolution of the three velocity components: at all times,
sigma_R,form > sigma_phi,form > sigma_Z,form. Post-formation heating primarily
increased sigma_R at ages < 4 Gyr but acted nearly isotropically for older
stars. The lookback time that the disk began to settle correlates with its
dynamical state today: earlier-settling galaxies currently form colder disks.
Young stars in FIRE-2 are kinematically hotter than the MW but broadly agree
with M31 and M33. Including stellar cosmic-ray feedback does not significantly
change the amount of disk rotational support at fixed stellar mass.

the manuscript many of the phenomena observed will be connected to the presence
of a lone electron pairs of the iodine atoms in the studied iodates. The
presence of the lone electron pairs plays a crucial role in the high-pressure
behavior of iodates and it is associated with many of the phenomena discussed
here, in particular with the pressure-induced changes in the character of
iodine-oxygen bonds, which causes many physical properties to behave
nonlinearly. Towards the end of this review, a discussion of current problems
that remain unsolved is presented as well as proposals for possible avenues for
future studies.

approaches to solve the Porous Medium Equation (PME). In the first approach, we
transform the PME to a log-density variable formulation and construct a
continuous Galerkin method. In the second approach, we introduce additional
potential and velocity variables to rewrite the PME into a system of equations,
for which we construct a mixed finite element method. Both approaches are
first-order accurate, mass conserving, and proved to be unconditionally energy
stable for their respective energies. The mixed approach is shown to preserve
positivity under a CFL condition, while a much stronger property of
unconditional bound preservation is proved for the log-density approach. A
novel feature of our schemes is that they can handle compactly supported
initial data without the need for any perturbation techniques. Furthermore, the
log-density method can handle unstructured grids in any number of dimensions,
while the mixed method can handle unstructured grids in two dimensions. We
present results from several numerical experiments to demonstrate these
properties.

  Dehazing","This paper is accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Considering the ill-posed nature, contrastive regularization has been
developed for single image dehazing, introducing the information from negative
images as a lower bound. However, the contrastive samples are nonconsensual, as
the negatives are usually represented distantly from the clear (i.e., positive)
image, leaving the solution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the
interpretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored towards the physics
of the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive
regularization targeted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a
non-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound
constraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding
restorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different
similarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the
learning difficulty of the multiple components is intrinsically imbalanced. To
tackle this issue, we customize a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the
importance of different negatives. In addition, to improve the interpretability
in the feature space, we build a physics-aware dual-branch unit according to
the atmospheric scattering model. With the unit, as well as curricular
contrastive regularization, we establish our dehazing network, named C2PNet.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our C2PNet significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, with extreme PSNR boosts of 3.94dB and 1.50dB,
respectively, on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets.

approaches is a major direction for revealing hidden market regularities. This
knowledge contributes to a profound understanding of financial market dynamics
and getting behavioural insights, which could hardly be discovered with
traditional analytical methods. Stock prices are inherently interrelated with
world events and social perception. Thus, in constructing the model for stock
price prediction, the critical stage is to incorporate such information on the
outside world, reflected through news and social media posts. To accommodate
this, researchers leverage the implicit or explicit knowledge representations:
(1) sentiments extracted from the texts or (2) raw text embeddings. However,
there is too little research attention to the direct comparison of these
approaches in terms of the influence on the predictive power of financial
models. In this paper, we aim to close this gap and figure out whether the
semantic features in the form of contextual embeddings are more valuable than
sentiment attributes for forecasting market trends. We consider the corpus of
Twitter posts related to the largest companies by capitalization from NASDAQ
and their close prices. To start, we demonstrate the connection of tweet
sentiments with the volatility of companies' stock prices. Convinced of the
existing relationship, we train Temporal Fusion Transformer models for price
prediction supplemented with either tweet sentiments or tweet embeddings. Our
results show that in the substantially prevailing number of cases, the use of
sentiment features leads to higher metrics. Noteworthy, the conclusions are
justifiable within the considered scenario involving Twitter posts and stocks
of the biggest tech companies.

show that transformer-based methods such as Bidirectional Encoder

lay text summarisation, with all but one study using these methods. A
combination of extractive and abstractive summarisation methods in a hybrid

to input text (e.g. applying extractive summarisation) or determining which

offers a promising method for reducing the time and resource burdens of
materials development through efficient correlation of structure-property

Towards demonstrating this, we have developed an end-to-end ""discovery cycle""
to select new aqueous amines compatible with the commercially viable acid gas
scrubbing carbon capture. We combine a simple, rapid laboratory assay for CO2
absorption with a machine learning based molecular fingerprinting model
approach. The prediction process shows 60% accuracy against experiment for both
material parameters and 80% for a single parameter on an external test set. The
discovery cycle determined several promising amines that were verified
experimentally, and which had not been applied to carbon capture previously. In
the process we have compiled a large, single-source data set for carbon capture
amines and produced an open source machine learning tool for the identification
of amine molecule candidates

superconductor/antiferromagnet (S/AF) interfaces, which work even for
interfaces with compensated antiferromagnets, were reported. One of them
suggests that the Neel order of the AF induces rapidly oscillating spin-triplet
correlations in the S layer. They are called Neel triplets and they suppress
singlet superconductivity. Nonmagnetic disorder destroys this type of triplet
correlations. As a result, the critical temperature of the S/AF bilayer grows
with impurity strength. The second mechanism, on the contrary, suggests that
nonmagnetic impurity scattering suppresses superconductivity in S/AF hybrids.
The predictions were made in the framework of two different quasiclassical
approaches [G. A. Bobkov et al. Phys. Rev. B 106, 144512 (2022) and E. H. Fyhn
et al. arXiv:2210.09325]. Here we suggest the unified theory of the proximity
effect in thin-film S/AF structures, which incorporates the both pictures as
limiting cases and study the proximity effect at S/AF interfaces for arbitrary
impurity strength, chemical potential and the value of the Neel exchange field.

  Interventions",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG econ.EM stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider a setting with $N$ heterogeneous units and $p$ interventions. Our
goal is to learn unit-specific potential outcomes for any combination of these
$p$ interventions, i.e., $N \times 2^p$ causal parameters. Choosing
combinations of interventions is a problem that naturally arises in many
applications such as factorial design experiments, recommendation engines
(e.g., showing a set of movies that maximizes engagement for users),
combination therapies in medicine, selecting important features for ML models,
etc. Running $N \times 2^p$ experiments to estimate the various parameters is
infeasible as $N$ and $p$ grow. Further, with observational data there is
likely confounding, i.e., whether or not a unit is seen under a combination is
correlated with its potential outcome under that combination. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model that imposes latent structure across both
units and combinations. We assume latent similarity across units (i.e., the
potential outcomes matrix is rank $r$) and regularity in how combinations
interact (i.e., the coefficients in the Fourier expansion of the potential
outcomes is $s$ sparse). We establish identification for all causal parameters
despite unobserved confounding. We propose an estimation procedure, Synthetic
Combinations, and establish finite-sample consistency under precise conditions
on the observation pattern. Our results imply Synthetic Combinations
consistently estimates unit-specific potential outcomes given $\text{poly}(r)
\times (N + s^2p)$ observations. In comparison, previous methods that do not
exploit structure across both units and combinations have sample complexity
scaling as $\min(N \times s^2p, \ \ r \times (N + 2^p))$. We use Synthetic
Combinations to propose a data-efficient experimental design mechanism for
combinatorial causal inference. We corroborate our theoretical findings with
numerical simulations.

the use of temporal causality applied to MARL problems. We then show how
causality can be used to penalise such lazy agents and improve their
behaviours. By understanding how their local observations are causally related
to the team reward, each agent in the team can adjust their individual credit
based on whether they helped to cause the reward or not. We show empirically
that using causality estimations in MARL improves not only the holistic

analyzing postmortem tissue samples. Although molecular transverse relaxation
informs local cellular microenvironment via molecule-environment interactions,
precise determination of the transverse relaxation times of molecules with
scalar couplings (J), such as glutamate and glutamine, is difficult using
current in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) technologies, whose
approach to measuring transverse relaxation has not changed for decades. We
introduce an in vivo MRS technique that achieves chemical shift encoding with
selectively locked J-couplings in each column of the acquired two-dimensional
dataset, freeing up the entire row dimension for transverse relaxation
encoding. This results in increased spectral resolution, minimized background
signals, and markedly broadened dynamic range for transverse relaxation
encoding. This technique enables determination of the transverse relaxation
times of glutamate and glutamine in vivo with unprecedented high precision.
Since glutamate predominantly resides in glutamatergic neurons and glutamine in
glia in the brain, this noninvasive technique provides a way to probe cellular
pathophysiology in neuropsychiatric disorders for characterizing disease
progression and monitoring treatment response in a cell type-specific manner in

multiplicative dagger linear logic, and investigates its applications to
Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM). The existing frameworks of CQM are
categorical proof theories of compact dagger linear logic, and are motivated by
the interpretation of quantum systems in the category of finite dimensional
Hilbert spaces. This thesis describes a new non-compact framework called Mixed
Unitary Categories which can accommodate infinite dimensional systems, and
develops models for the framework. To this end, it builds on linearly
distributive categories, and $*$-autonomous categories which are categorical
proof theories of (non-compact) multiplicative linear logic. The proof theory
of non-compact dagger-linear logic is obtained from the basic setting of an LDC
by adding a dagger functor satisfying appropriate coherences to give a
dagger-LDC. From every (isomix) dagger-LDC one can extract a canonical ""unitary
core"" which up to equivalence is the traditional CQM framework of
dagger-monoidal categories. This leads to the framework of Mixed Unitary
Categories (MUCs): every MUC contains a (compact) unitary core which is
extended by a (non-compact) isomix dagger-LDC. Various models of MUCs based on
Finiteness Spaces, Chu spaces, Hopf modules, etc., are developed in this
thesis. This thesis also generalizes the key algebraic structures of CQM, such
as observables, measurement, and complementarity, to MUC framework.
Furthermore, using the MUC framework, this thesis establishes a connection
between the complementary observables of quantum mechanics and the exponential
modalities of linear logic.

  practitioners; difference-in-differences evidence from the implementation of
  mandatory family medicine residencies in Canada",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: There is currently interest in extending medical residency
training in several countries including the United States and Canada. There is
little evidence on what impacts extending medical residency has on supply of
primary care practitioners.
  Methods: I leverage the province-by-province roll-out of mandatory family
medicine residencies in Canada from 1976 to 1994. This mandated that
practitioners had to complete a two year residency instead of a one year
internship. I use annual Canadian Institute of Health Information data on
supply of physicians by specialty and province. I employ a
difference-in-differences estimation strategy comparing specialties impacted by
the legislation to those that had no change in their residency length (first
difference). I compare before and after legislation by province (second
difference).
  Results: I find reductions in the supply of family medicine practitioners in
the range of 5-10% of overall supply after implementation of a longer
residency. This reduction is statistically significant lasting five years after
mandate and point estimates of supply do not return to baseline until eight
years after mandates. I find increases in the number of graduates of other
programs that might plausibly substitute for family medicine suggestive that
the policy drove medical students towards other residencies.
  Conclusion: Extending residency length has the potential to cause declines in
physician supply over the short to medium run. There are both direct effects on
physician supply through delays in cohorts as well as indirect effects through
substitution away from family medicine residencies.

an attractive solution to the small-scale issues faced by the Cold Dark Matter
(CDM) paradigm. The delay of structure formation in WDM models and the
associated dearth of low-mass systems at high-redshifts makes this an ideal
time to revisit WDM constraints in light of the unprecedented data-sets from
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Developing a phenomenological model
based on the halo mass functions in CDM and WDM models, we calculate
high-redshift ($z \gt 6$) the stellar mass functions (SMF) and the associated
stellar mass density (SMD) and the maximum stellar mass allowed in a given
volume. We find that: (i) WDM as light as 1.5 keV is already disfavoured by the
low-mass end of the SMF (stellar mass $M_* \sim 10^7 \rm{M_\odot}$) although
caution must be exerted given the impact of lensing uncertainties; (ii) 1.5 keV
WDM models predict SMD values that show a steep decrease from $10^{8.8}$ to
$10^{2} ~{\rm M_\odot ~cMpc^{-3}}$ from $z \sim 4$ to 17 for $M_* \gt 10^8
\rm{M_\odot}$; (iii) the 1.5 keV WDM model predicts a sharp and earlier cut-off
in the maximum stellar masses for a given number density (or volume) as
compared to CDM or heavier WDM models. For example, with a number density of
$10^{-3} \rm {cMpc^{-3}}$, 1.5 (3) KeV WDM models do not predict bound objects

role of small random initialization and how the various parameters of the model
are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate good generalization
remain largely mysterious. A series of recent papers have begun to study this
role for non-convex formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD)
matrix sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD matrix from
a few linear measurements. The underlying symmetry/PSDness is crucial to
existing convergence and generalization guarantees for this problem. In this
paper, we study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing problem
where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric rectangular low-rank matrix from
a few linear measurements. We prove that an overparameterized model trained via
factorized gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating the
measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized gradient descent enjoys
two implicit properties: (1) coupling of the trajectory of gradient descent
where the factors are coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update
trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property where the iterates
show a propensity towards low-rank models despite the overparameterized nature
of the factorized model. These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show
that the gradient descent trajectory from small random initialization moves
towards solutions that are both globally optimal and generalize well.

analyze the functional changes in the obtained silica coatings. The coating
synthesized in a methanol environment showed a polarization resistance (Rp)
almost an order of magnitude greater than those synthesized in the other
organic solvents. The greatest thickness, nearly 1.5 um, was obtained with the
ethanol based coatings. Almost twice as much force (near 11 N) was required to
detach the acetone based coatings, compared to the other coatings. Propanol and
butanol contribute to the defects created and the decreased protection
properties in the final materials and show a statistically significant
influence on the formed corrosion film under sol-gel coatings, particularly for
coatings based on propanol. No statistically significant influence of the
solvents was observed on the thickness of coatings prepared with butanol or
acetone.

approximations are widely used in analyses aiming to identify departures from
the concordance model at late-times. Under these approximations, it is
generally assumed that time derivatives are subdominant with respect to spatial
derivatives given that the relevant physical modes are those well inside the
Hubble radius. Here, in the context of the effective fluid approach applied to
$f(R)$ theories, we put forward a new parameterization which allows us to
obtain analytical expressions for the gravitational potentials, whence for the
effective dark energy perturbations. In order to track the validity of the two
aforementioned approximations, we compare our results and the standard results
found in the literature against full numerical solutions for two well-known
toy-models; namely, the designer ($f$DES) model and the Hu-Sawicki (HS) model.
We find that: $i)$ the sub-horizon approximation can be safely applied for
scales $k \gtrsim 200 H_0$, $ii)$ in this ``safety region'', the quasi-static
approximation is a very accurate description of the late-time dynamics even
when dark energy significantly contribute to the cosmic budget, $iii)$ some
relevant terms were neglected in the standard procedure yielding to inaccurate
results in some of the dark energy effective fluid quantities; e.g. the sound
speed. Instead, our expressions show overall agreement with respect to the full
solutions. Therefore, our results indirectly indicate that the effective fluid
expressions derived for more general modified gravity theories, such as
Horndeski, should be revisited.

improving testability. We collected and studied 346,841 java pull requests from
621 GitHub projects. First, we compared the atomic refactorings in two
populations: pull requests with changed test-pairs (i.e. with co-changes in
production and test code and thus potentially including testability
refactoring) and pull requests without test-pairs. We found significantly more
atomic refactorings in test-pairs pull requests, such as Change Variable Type
Operation or Change Parameter Type. Second, we manually analyzed the code

""testability"" or ""refactor + test"". We identified ten composite refactoring

designed for classification, where class labels can be preserved even if
augmentation alters the temporal dynamics. We note that augmentation designed
for forecasting requires diversity as well as coherence with the original
temporal dynamics. As time-series data generated by real-life physical
processes exhibit characteristics in both the time and frequency domains, we
propose to combine Spectral and Time Augmentation (STAug) for generating more
diverse and coherent samples. Specifically, in the frequency domain, we use the
Empirical Mode Decomposition to decompose a time series and reassemble the
subcomponents with random weights. This way, we generate diverse samples while
being coherent with the original temporal relationships as they contain the
same set of base components. In the time domain, we adapt a mix-up strategy
that generates diverse as well as linearly in-between coherent samples.
Experiments on five real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that STAug
outperforms the base models without data augmentation as well as
state-of-the-art augmentation methods.

changes a given motion sequence of a virtual agent as needed to adjust to the

of the motion sequence most important for modeling interactions with the scene
and pair them with the relevant scene geometry, obstacles, and semantics such
that interactions in the agents motion match the affordances of the scene
(e.g., standing on a floor or sitting in a chair). We then optimize the motion
of the human by directly altering the high-DOF pose at each frame in the motion
to better account for the unique geometric constraints of the scene. Our
formulation uses novel loss functions that maintain a realistic flow and
natural-looking motion. We compare our method with prior motion generating
techniques and highlight the benefits of our method with a perceptual study and
physical plausibility metrics. Human raters preferred our method over the prior
approaches. Specifically, they preferred our method 57.1% of the time versus
the state-of-the-art method using existing motions, and 81.0% of the time

comparatively limited success in spite of the fact that stress and anxiety
disorders are among the most common issues people deal with in their daily

development of a more robust analytic framework for the measurement of
indicators of mental health, we propose a multi-modal semi-supervised framework
for tracking physiological precursors of the stress response. Our methodology
enables utilizing multi-modal data of differing domains and resolutions from
wearable devices and leveraging them to map short-term episodes to semantically
efficient embeddings for a given task. Additionally, we leverage an

transferring knowledge and compatibility with other devices easier to achieve.
In our pipeline, a task-specific pooling based on an attention mechanism, which
estimates the contribution of each modality on an instance level, computes the
final embeddings for observations. This additionally provides a thorough
diagnostic insight into the data characteristics and highlights the importance
of signals in the broader view of predicting episodes annotated per mental

blob-filaments has been developed. The theory treats blob filaments in the
closed flux surface region or the region that is disconnected from sheaths in
the SOL. It extends previous work by treating blob spin, arising from partially
or fully adiabatic electrons, as the leading order effect and retaining
inertial (ion charge polarization) physics in next order. Spin helps to
maintain blob coherency and affects the blob's propagation speed. Dipole charge
polarization, treated perturbatively, gives rise to blob-filaments with
relatively slow radial velocity, comparable to that observed in the
simulations. The theory also treats the interaction of rapidly spinning blob
filaments with a zonal flow layer. It is shown analytically that the flow layer
can act like a transport barrier for these structures. Finally parallel
electron kinetic effects are incorporated into the theory. Various asymptotic
parameter regimes are discussed and asymptotic expressions for the radial and
poloidal motion of the blob-filaments are obtained.

by performing 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we
choose three hydrodynamical models for merger ejecta, two including jets with
different luminosities and one without a jet structure, to help decipher the
impact of jets on the light curve and polarimetric behaviour. In terms of
photometry, we find distinct color evolutions across the three models. Models
without a jet show the highest variation in light curves for different viewing
angles. In contrast, to previous studies, we find models with a jet to produce
fainter kilonovae when viewed from orientations close to the jet axis, compared
to a model without a jet. In terms of polarimetry, we predict relatively low
levels (<~0.3-0.4%) at all orientations that, however, remain non-negligible
until a few days after the merger and longer than previously found. Despite the
low levels, we find that the presence of a jet enhances the degree of
polarization at wavelengths ranging from 0.25 to 2.5\micron, an effect that is
found to increase with the jet luminosity. Thus, future photometric and
polarimetric campaigns should observe kilonovae in blue and red filters for a
few days after the merger to help constrain the properties of the ejecta (e.g.
composition) and jet.

to obtain a state representation that is parsimonious and satisfies the Markov

dimension of the state can slow learning and obfuscate the learned policy. We
introduce the notion of a minimal sufficient state in a Markov decision process

propose a novel sequential knockoffs (SEEK) algorithm that estimates the

the method is agnostic to the reinforcement learning algorithm being applied,
it benefits downstream tasks such as policy optimization. Empirical experiments

completion time and the participants' perceptions of the robot by rating its
behavior as intelligent or random. Participants also evaluated the robot by
filling out the Godspeed questionnaire. We found that human collaboration was
higher when the robot displayed a happy facial expression at the beginning of

distributions provided the times between the impact of the positrons and the
emission of the annihilation gammas are short compared to the flight times of
the electrons. This is typically the case since positrons have short lifetime
in solids ($\sim$ 100 - 500 ps) compared to the flight times of the secondary
electrons ($10^2$ ns to $10^3$ ns). However, if the positron leaves the surface

migration, and habitability. We investigate the plausibility of exomoons
orbiting the temperate ($T_\text{eq}=294$ K) giant ($R = 9.2$
$\text{R}_\oplus$) planet HIP 41378 f. Previous studies have suggested that HIP
41378 f has a low apparent bulk density of $0.09\,\text{g}\,\text{cm}^{-3}$ and
a flat near-infrared transmission spectrum, suggesting that it may possess
circumplanetary rings. Given the planet's long orbital period ($P\approx1.5$
yr), it may also host a large exomoon. Here, we consider a hypothetical exomoon
orbiting HIP 41378 f with the same satellite-to-planet mass ratio as the
Moon-Earth system and assess its orbital stability using a suite of N-body and
tidal migration simulations. We find that satellites up to this size are
largely stable against Hill sphere escape and collisions with the host planet,
consistent with theoretical stability limits determined by previous studies. We
then simulate the expected transit signal from the exomoon and show that
current transit observations likely cannot constrain the presence of exomoons
orbiting HIP 41378 f, though future observations may be capable of detecting
exomoons in other systems. Finally, we simulate the combined transmission
spectrum of HIP 41378 f and an exomoon with a low-metallicity atmosphere, and
show that the total effective spectrum is contaminated at the $\sim$10 ppm
level. Our work not only demonstrates the feasibility of exomoons orbiting HIP
41378 f, but also shows that large exomoons may be a source of uncertainty in
future high-precision measurements of exoplanet systems.

completely nonparametric as the dissimilarities between stationary

potential reference for more-central A-A collisions with regard to production
(or not) of a thermalized quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Small systems with low
particle densities should evolve according to simple QCD mechanisms including
projectile-nucleon dissociation and dijet production. But it is now claimed
that QGP may appear even in $p$-$p$ collisions based on apparent evidence for
radial flow from shape evolution of $p_t$ spectra and from variation of total
yields for strange and multistrange hadrons relative to statistical models. The
present study confronts such arguments with a detailed analysis of $p_t$
spectra for strange and multistrange hadrons from 5 TeV $p$-Pb collisions and
13 TeV $p$-$p$ collisions via a two-component model (TCM) of hadron production.
Based on previous analysis of lighter hadrons the TCM accurately predicts
spectra for Cascade and Omega hadrons. Significant results include multistrange
hadron spectra dominated by jet fragments, variation of strange-hadron
abundances exaggerated by certain plot formats and spectrum extrapolations, and
detailed relations between ensemble-mean $\bar p_t$ evolution with event charge
density and small shifts of jet fragment distributions on $p_t$. Within the
context of the TCM, $p$-$p$ and $p$-Pb collision systems with comparable jet
contributions are found to be equivalent within data uncertainties. Attribution
of certain data features to radial flow is falsified.

Fifty-six participants searched a 3D environment containing 48 objects in a
room, in order to locate a target object that was viewed prior to each trial.
They searched either unaided or assisted by one of three HMD types of cues: an
arrow pointing to the target, a plan-view minimap highlighting the target, and
a constantly visible icon depicting the appearance of the target object. The
cue was incorrect on 17% of the trials for one group of participants and 100%
correct for the second group. Through both analysis and modeling of both search
speed and accuracy, the results indicated that the arrow and minimap cues
depicting location information were more effective than the icon cue depicting
visual appearance, both overall, and when the cue was correct. However, there
was a tradeoff on the infrequent occasions when the cue erred. The most
effective AR-based cue led to a greater automation bias, in which the cue was
more often blindly followed without careful examination of the raw images. The
results speak to the benefits of augmented reality and the need to examine
potential costs when AR-conveyed information may be incorrect because of
imperfectly reliable systems.

learning image aesthetics from user comments, and exploring vision-language

protect IoT from malicious intrusions is of vital importance. However, the data
scarcity of IoT hinders the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection
methods. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose the Adaptive
Bi-Recommendation and Self-Improving Network (ABRSI) based on unsupervised
heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). The ABRSI transfers enrich intrusion
knowledge from a data-rich network intrusion source domain to facilitate
effective intrusion detection for data-scarce IoT target domains. The ABRSI
achieves fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer via adaptive
bi-recommendation matching. Matching the bi-recommendation interests of two
recommender systems and the alignment of intrusion categories in the shared
feature space form a mutual-benefit loop. Besides, the ABRSI uses a
self-improving mechanism, autonomously improving the intrusion knowledge
transfer from four ways. A hard pseudo label voting mechanism jointly considers
recommender system decision and label relationship information to promote more
accurate hard pseudo label assignment. To promote diversity and target data
participation during intrusion knowledge transfer, target instances failing to
be assigned with a hard pseudo label will be assigned with a probabilistic soft
pseudo label, forming a hybrid pseudo-labelling strategy. Meanwhile, the ABRSI
also makes soft pseudo-labels globally diverse and individually certain.
Finally, an error knowledge learning mechanism is utilised to adversarially
exploit factors that causes detection ambiguity and learns through both current
and previous error knowledge, preventing error knowledge forgetfulness.
Holistically, these mechanisms form the ABRSI model that boosts IoT intrusion
detection accuracy via HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer.

heuristic rules for obtaining low-complexity solutions. Moreover, we present
state-of-the-art ML algorithms and applications towards RISs, i.e., supervised

Model-based, heuristic, and ML approaches are compared in terms of stability,

kernels limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only.
Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface,
remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and
spherical domains. For this purpose, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite
imagery. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance
of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each
pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC)
image segmentation and Graph Attention GAT. The superpixels obtained from SLIC
become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). We then construct a
region adjacency graph (RAG) where each superpixel is connected to every other
adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally.
Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN)
to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for
spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are
irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We
introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one
supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting
in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block
Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). We evaluate our proposed methods on two remote
sensing datasets namely Asia14 and C2D2. In comparison with both non-graph and

in Si migrate across the interface toward the surface of SrTiO3 due to surface
depletion. The electron transfer in turn creates an electric field across the
interface that modifies the interfacial dipole associated with bonding between
SrTiO3 and Si, leading to a change in the band alignment from type-II to
type-III. By capping the SrTiO3 surface with ultra-thin layers of BaO, SrO or
TiO2, charge transfer across the interface can be weakened or inhibited. Ab
initio modeling implicates the adsorption of oxygen as driving surface
depletion in SrTiO3. The electronic coupling between the surface and buried

for poison data while keeping predictions on the clean dataset unchanged, which
creates a considerable threat to current natural language processing (NLP)
systems. Existing backdoor attacking systems face two severe issues:firstly,
most backdoor triggers follow a uniform and usually input-independent pattern,
e.g., insertion of specific trigger words, synonym replacement. This
significantly hinders the stealthiness of the attacking model, leading the
trained backdoor model being easily identified as malicious by model probes.
Secondly, trigger-inserted poisoned sentences are usually disfluent,
ungrammatical, or even change the semantic meaning from the original sentence,
making them being easily filtered in the pre-processing stage. To resolve these
two issues, in this paper, we propose an input-unique backdoor attack(NURA),
where we generate backdoor triggers unique to inputs. IDBA generates
context-related triggers by continuing writing the input with a language model
like GPT2. The generated sentence is used as the backdoor trigger. This
strategy not only creates input-unique backdoor triggers, but also preserves
the semantics of the original input, simultaneously resolving the two issues
above. Experimental results show that the IDBA attack is effective for attack
and difficult to defend: it achieves high attack success rate across all the
widely applied benchmarks, while is immune to existing defending methods. In
addition, it is able to generate fluent, grammatical, and diverse backdoor
inputs, which can hardly be recognized through human inspection.

defined in a finite zigzag graphene nanoribbon. We investigated the influence
of the Kondo couplings with the helical liquids on both the static and dynamic
properties of the ground state. The number and distinct spatial structures of
the active natural orbitals (ANOs), which play essential roles in constructing
the ground-state wave function, were first analyzed. Our numerical results
indicate that two ANOs emerge, equal to the number of helical liquids.
Specifically, at the coupling symmetry point, both ANOs are fully active with
their spatial structures being respectively constituted by the different
helical liquids. In comparison, when deviating from the symmetry point, only
one ANO remains fully active, which is dominantly constructed by the helical
liquid with the larger Kondo coupling. Local screening of the impurity,
described by the impurity spin polarization and susceptibility, was further
studied. It shows that at the coupling symmetry point, the impurity is
maximally polarized and the spin susceptibility reaches the maximum. On the
contrary, the impurity tends to be screened without polarization when the Kondo
couplings deviate well from the symmetry point. The Kondo screening cloud,
manifested by the spin correlation between the impurity and the conduction
electrons, was finally explored. It is demonstrated that the Kondo cloud is
mainly formed by the helical liquid with the larger Kondo coupling to the
impurity. On the other hand, the spin-orbital coupling breaks the symmetry in
spatial distribution of the spin correlation, leading to anisotropy in the
Kondo cloud.

Furthermore, thanks to the retrieval module, our method gives the user or

been transformed by Internet technology, the experience of reading research
papers has changed little in decades. The PDF format for sharing research
papers is widely used due to its portability, but it has significant downsides
including: static content, poor accessibility for low-vision readers, and

recent advances in AI and HCI power intelligent, interactive, and accessible

Project, a collaborative effort across multiple institutions to explore
automatic creation of dynamic reading interfaces for research papers. Through
this project, we've developed ten research prototype interfaces and conducted
usability studies with more than 300 participants and real-world users showing
improved reading experiences for scholars. We've also released a production
reading interface for research papers that will incorporate the best features
as they mature. We structure this paper around challenges scholars and the
public face when reading research papers -- Discovery, Efficiency,

  Decomposition","Accepted by SPIE23",,,,"cs.AI cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Multiple patterning lithography (MPL) is regarded as one of the most
promising ways of overcoming the resolution limitations of conventional optical
lithography due to the delay of next-generation lithography technology. As the
feature size continues to decrease, layout decomposition for multiple
patterning lithography (MPLD) technology is becoming increasingly crucial for
improving the manufacturability in advanced nodes. The decomposition process
refers to assigning the layout features to different mask layers according to
the design rules and density requirements. When the number of masks $k \geq 3$,
the MPLD problems are NP-hard and thus may suffer from runtime overhead for
practical designs. However, the number of layout patterns is increasing
exponentially in industrial layouts, which hinders the runtime performance of
MPLD models. In this research, we substitute the CPU's dance link data
structure with parallel GPU matrix operations to accelerate the solution for
exact cover-based MPLD algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our
system is capable of full-scale, lightning-fast layout decomposition, which can
achieve more than 10$\times$ speed-up without quality degradation compared to
state-of-the-art layout decomposition methods.

time-sensitive comprehensive understanding of the situation to allow for
appropriate decision-making and effective action response. Automated generation
of situation reports can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for
domain experts when preparing their official human-curated reports. However, AI
research toward this goal has been very limited, and no successful trials have
yet been conducted to automate such report generation. We propose SmartBook, a
novel task formulation targeting situation report generation, which consumes
large volumes of news data to produce a structured situation report with
multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded with rich links to factual
evidence. We realize SmartBook for the Ukraine-Russia crisis by automatically
generating intelligence analysis reports to assist expert analysts. The
machine-generated reports are structured in the form of timelines, with each
timeline organized by major events (or chapters), corresponding strategic
questions (or sections) and their grounded summaries (or section content). Our
proposed framework automatically detects real-time event-related strategic
questions, which are more directed than manually-crafted analyst questions,
which tend to be too complex, hard to parse, vague and high-level. Results from
thorough qualitative evaluations show that roughly 82% of the questions in
Smartbook have strategic importance, with at least 93% of the sections in the
report being tactically useful. Further, experiments show that expert analysts
tend to add more information into the SmartBook reports, with only 2.3% of the
existing tokens being deleted, meaning SmartBook can serve as a useful
foundation for analysts to build upon when creating intelligence reports.

  Photoionization of Atoms, edited by S. Nahar and G. Hinojosa",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stellar atmospheres separate the hot and dense stellar interiors from the
emptiness of space. Radiation escapes from the outermost layers of a star,
carrying direct physical information. Underneath the atmosphere, the very high
opacity keeps radiation thermalized and resembling a black body with the local
temperature. In the atmosphere the opacity drops, and radiative energy leaks
out, which is redistributed in wavelength according to the physical processes
by which matter and radiation interact, in particular photoionization. In this
article, I will evaluate the role of photoionization in shaping the stellar
energy distribution of stars. To that end, I employ simple, state-of-the-art
plane-parallel model atmospheres and a spectral synthesis code, dissecting the
effects of photoionization from different chemical elements and species, for
stars of different masses in the range of 0.3 to 2 M$_{\odot}$. I examine and
interpret the changes in the observed spectral energy distributions of the
stars as a function of the atmospheric parameters. The photoionization of
atomic hydrogen and H$^-$ are the most relevant contributors to the continuum
opacity in the optical and near-infrared regions, while heavier elements become
important in the ultraviolet region. In the spectra of the coolest stars
(spectral types M and later), the continuum shape from photoionization is no
longer recognizable due to the accumulation of lines, mainly from molecules.
These facts have been known for a long time, but the calculations presented
provide an updated quantitative evaluation and insight into the role of
photoionization on the structure of stellar atmospheres.

structures for $M$Te$_2$ ($M =$ Pt, Pd, and Ni) with van der Waals (vdW)
stacking, where two monolayers are related by $C_{2z}$ rotation, and have
demonstrated that these $\pi$-bilayers are typical ferroelectric metals (FEMs).
The vertical polarization of PtTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayer is 0.46 pC/m, comparable to
that of FEM WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$ $\pi$-bilayers. We show that the switching of
polarization can be realized through interlayer sliding, which only requires
crossing a very small energy barrier. The interlayer vdW charge transfer is the
source of both vertical polarization and metallicity, and these properties are
closely related to the spatially extended Te-$p_z$ orbital. Finally, we reveal
that electron doping can significantly adjust the vertical polarization of
these FEMs in both magnitude and direction. Our findings introduce a new class

clean image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover
the clean image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original
measurement throughout the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in
trading off perceptual quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling
speedup via early-stopping. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on
different high-resolution datasets and inverse problems, achieving great
improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with respect

network function virtualization, with the O-RAN serving as the primary

experience without effective traffic control or resource allocation. To address
this, we consider mobility-aware load balancing to evenly distribute loads
across the network, preventing network congestion and user outages caused by
excessive load concentration on open radio unit (O-RU) governed by a single
open distributed unit (O-DU). We have proposed a multi-agent multi-armed bandit
for load balancing and resource allocation (mmLBRA) scheme, designed to both
achieve load balancing and improve the effective sum-rate performance of the
O-RAN network. We also present the mmLBRA-LB and mmLBRA-RA sub-schemes that can
operate independently in non-realtime RAN intelligent controller (Non-RT RIC)

high-rate in O-RUs. Simulation results show that the proposed mmLBRA scheme
significantly increases the effective network sum-rate while achieving better
load balancing across O-RUs compared to rule-based and other existing heuristic

not have enough supervised data for training locally. Thus, the performance of
the collaborative model is subpar under limited supervision. On the other hand,
large institutions have the resources to compile data repositories with
high-resolution images and labels. Therefore, individual clients can utilize
the knowledge acquired in the public data repositories to mitigate the shortage

The supervised learning of the proposed method extracts features from limited

both feature and response-based knowledge from a national data repository to
further improve the accuracy of the collaborative model and reduce the

image semantic segmentation. However, the performance is hampered by distortion
of the equirectangular projection (ERP) and a lack of pixel-wise annotations.
For this reason, some works treat the ERP and pinhole images equally and
transfer knowledge from the pinhole to ERP images via unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA). However, they fail to handle the domain gaps caused by: 1)
the inherent differences between camera sensors and captured scenes; 2) the
distinct image formats (e.g., ERP and pinhole images). In this paper, we
propose a novel yet flexible dual-path UDA framework, DPPASS, taking ERP and
tangent projection (TP) images as inputs. To reduce the domain gaps, we propose
cross-projection and intra-projection training. The cross-projection training
includes tangent-wise feature contrastive training and prediction consistency
training. That is, the former formulates the features with the same projection
locations as positive examples and vice versa, for the models' awareness of
distortion, while the latter ensures the consistency of cross-model predictions
between the ERP and TP. Moreover, adversarial intra-projection training is
proposed to reduce the inherent gap, between the features of the pinhole images
and those of the ERP and TP images, respectively. Importantly, the TP path can
be freely removed after training, leading to no additional inference cost.
Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that our DPPASS achieves +1.06$\%$
mIoU increment than the state-of-the-art approaches.

nanopyramid (u-NPyr) using a multi-step molding process on flexible plastics as
SERS sensors for the ultrasensitive detection of haemoglobin at a very low
concentration (down to nM). First, a Si i-NPyr master was created using
electron beam lithography, then i-NPyr and u-NPyr structures were imprinted on
flexible polymer substrates using nanoimprinting lithography, and last, Ag/Au
coatings were coated on top of them. The SERS activity of the imprinted i-NPyr
and u-NPyr substrates were evaluated using rhodamine 6G (Rh6G) as probe
molecules. Enhancement factor (EF) values of 3.88 x 10^6 and 7.86 x 10^5
respectively for the iNPyr and u-NPyr substrates, and the i-NPyr SERS substrate
was able to detect Rh6G at concentrations as low as 1pM. In addition, we
investigated the stability and resilience of i-NPyr by thoroughly analysing
signal performance under angled bending and delicate crumpling. Finally, a
proof-of-concept application as a wearable i-NPyr SERS sensor was demonstrated
by detecting the analyte in sweat excreted during running and walking. We
believe that this extremely sensitive i-NPyr SERS substrate with dense electric
field confinement around hotspots (confirmed using computational simulations),
as well as its good stability, durability, and low production cost, may enable
in-situ measurement of analytes in wearable technologies.

tasks and have become mainstream. It remains challenging to disambiguate frame
representations evoked by target lexical units under different contexts.
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have been used in semantic parsing and
significantly improve the accuracy of neural parsers. However, the PLMs-based
approaches tend to favor collocated patterns presented in the training data,
leading to inaccurate outcomes. The intuition here is to design a mechanism to
optimally use knowledge captured in semantic frames in conjunction with PLMs to
disambiguate frames. We propose a novel Knowledge-Augmented Frame Semantic
Parsing Architecture (KAF-SPA) to enhance semantic representation by
incorporating accurate frame knowledge into PLMs during frame semantic parsing.
Specifically, a Memory-based Knowledge Extraction Module (MKEM) is devised to
select accurate frame knowledge and construct the continuous templates in the
high dimensional vector space. Moreover, we design a Task-oriented Knowledge
Probing Module (TKPM) using hybrid prompts (in terms of continuous and discrete
prompts) to incorporate the selected knowledge into the PLMs and adapt PLMs to
the tasks of frame and argument identification. Experimental results on two
public FrameNet datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
strong baselines (by more than +3$\%$ in F1), achieving state-of-art results on
the current benchmark. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of KAF-SPA.

The PD is connected to the shallow level feature map and computes the GAN loss

scribble-supervised VOS lie in two aspects. On the one hand, it requires the
powerful ability to learn from the sparse scribble annotations during training.
On the other hand, it demands strong reasoning capability during inference

Reliability-Hierarchical Memory Network (RHMNet) to predict the target mask in
a step-wise expanding strategy w.r.t. the memory reliability level. To be
specific, RHMNet first only uses the memory in the high-reliability level to
locate the region with high reliability belonging to the target, which is
highly similar to the initial target scribble. Then it expands the located
high-reliability region to the entire target conditioned on the region itself

transferability and flexibility in novel concepts (e.g., cross-modality
transfer) across various visual tasks. However, VL-driven segmentation has been
under-explored, and the existing approaches still have the burden of acquiring
additional training images or even segmentation annotations to adapt a VL model
to downstream segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel
image-free segmentation task where the goal is to perform semantic segmentation
given only a set of the target semantic categories, but without any
task-specific images and annotations. To tackle this challenging task, our
proposed method, coined IFSeg, generates VL-driven artificial
image-segmentation pairs and updates a pre-trained VL model to a segmentation
task. We construct this artificial training data by creating a 2D map of random
semantic categories and another map of their corresponding word tokens. Given
that a pre-trained VL model projects visual and text tokens into a common space
where tokens that share the semantics are located closely, this artificially
generated word map can replace the real image inputs for such a VL model.
Through an extensive set of experiments, our model not only establishes an
effective baseline for this novel task but also demonstrates strong
performances compared to existing methods that rely on stronger supervision,
such as task-specific images and segmentation masks. Code is available at

dives into FD mmWave MIMO with the assistance of reconfigurable intelligent

angular-domain reciprocity of FD antenna arrays under the far-field planar
wavefront assumption. Accordingly, a strategy for joint downlink-uplink (DL-UL)
channel estimation is presented. For estimating the SI channel, the direct
channel, and the cascaded channel, the Khatri-Rao product-based compressive

vector-based D-CS (M-D-CS) frameworks are proposed, respectively. Additionally,
we propose a passive beamforming optimization solution based on the
angular-domain cascaded channel. With hybrid beamforming architectures, a novel
hybrid weighted minimum mean squared error method for SI cancellation
(H-WMMSE-SIC) is proposed. Simulations have revealed that joint DL-UL
processing significantly improves estimation performance in comparison to
separate DL/UL channel estimation. Particularly, when the interference-to-noise

performance comparable to fully-digital WMMSE-SIC. Finally, the computational
complexity is analyzed for our proposed methods.

miscalibration of DNNs fall under the scope of classification and consider only

2021] to the setting of three or more parties. An election campaign among two
or more parties is viewed as a game of two or more players. Each of them has
its own candidates as the pure strategies to play. People, as voters, comprise
supporters for each party, and a candidate brings utility for the the
supporters of each party. Each player nominates exactly one of its candidates
to compete against the other party's. A candidate is assumed to win the
election with higher odds if it brings more utility for all the people. The
payoff of each player is the expected utility its supporters get. The game is
egoistic if every candidate benefits her party's supporters more than any
candidate from the competing party does. In this work, we first argue that the
election game always has a pure Nash equilibrium when the winner is chosen by
the hardmax function, while there exist game instances in the three-party
election game such that no pure Nash equilibrium exists even the game is
egoistic. Next, we propose two sufficient conditions for the egoistic election
game to have a pure Nash equilibrium. Based on these conditions, we propose a
fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute a pure Nash equilibrium of the
egoistic election game. Finally, perhaps surprisingly, we show that the price
of anarchy of the egoistic election game is upper bounded by the number of
parties. Our findings suggest that the election becomes unpredictable when more
than two parties are involved and, moreover, the social welfare deteriorates
with the number of participating parties in terms of possibly increasing price
of anarchy. This work alternatively explains why the two-party system is

Training (VL-SAT) scheme that can significantly empower 3DSSG prediction models
with discrimination about long-tailed and ambiguous semantic relations. The key
idea is to train a powerful multi-modal oracle model to assist the 3D model.
This oracle learns reliable structural representations based on semantics from
vision, language, and 3D geometry, and its benefits can be heterogeneously
passed to the 3D model during the training stage. By effectively utilizing
visual-linguistic semantics in training, our VL-SAT can significantly boost

propose a simple and versatile technique called Few-Shot Task-Aware Compression

task, such as classification over ImageNet-22K, TACO produces a smaller model
that is accurate on specialized tasks, such as classification across vehicle
types or animal species. Crucially, TACO works in few-shot fashion, i.e. only a

overheads. We validate TACO on highly-accurate ResNet, ViT/DeiT, and ConvNeXt

specialize and compress to a diverse set of ""downstream"" subtasks. TACO can
reduce the number of non-zero parameters in existing models by up to 20x

large-scale pre-trained language-image models, a number of discriminative
models (e.g., image classification and object detection) trained on limited
base classes are empowered with the ability of unseen class prediction.
Inspired by this, we opt to leverage large-scale pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to achieve the generation of unseen semantics. The key
challenge of FLIS is how to enable the diffusion model to synthesize images
from a specific layout which very likely violates its pre-learned knowledge,
e.g., the model never sees ""a unicorn sitting on a bench"" during its
pre-training. To this end, we introduce a new module called Rectified
Cross-Attention (RCA) that can be conveniently plugged in the diffusion model
to integrate semantic masks. This ""plug-in"" is applied in each cross-attention
layer of the model to rectify the attention maps between image and text tokens.
The key idea of RCA is to enforce each text token to act on the pixels in a
specified region, allowing us to freely put a wide variety of semantics from
pre-trained knowledge (which is general) onto the given layout (which is
specific). Extensive experiments show that the proposed diffusion network
produces realistic and freestyle layout-to-image generation results with
diverse text inputs, which has a high potential to spawn a bunch of interesting

  Imaging with Self-Supervised Deep Learning","To be submitted to Optics Express",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Noise is an important issue for radiographic and tomographic imaging
techniques. It becomes particularly critical in applications where additional
constraints force a strong reduction of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) per
image. These constraints may result from limitations on the maximum available
flux or permissible dose and the associated restriction on exposure time.
Often, a high SNR per image is traded for the ability to distribute a given
total exposure capacity per pixel over multiple channels, thus obtaining
additional information about the object by the same total exposure time. These
can be energy channels in the case of spectroscopic imaging or time channels in
the case of time-resolved imaging. In this paper, we report on a method for
improving the quality of noisy multi-channel (time or energy-resolved) imaging
datasets. The method relies on the recent Noise2Noise (N2N) self-supervised
denoising approach that learns to predict a noise-free signal without access to
noise-free data. N2N in turn requires drawing pairs of samples from a data
distribution sharing identical signals while being exposed to different samples
of random noise. The method is applicable if adjacent channels share enough
information to provide images with similar enough information but independent
noise. We demonstrate several representative case studies, namely spectroscopic
(k-edge) X-ray tomography, in vivo X-ray cine-radiography, and
energy-dispersive (Bragg edge) neutron tomography. In all cases, the N2N method
shows dramatic improvement and outperforms conventional denoising methods. For
such imaging techniques, the method can therefore significantly improve image
quality, or maintain image quality with further reduced exposure time per
image.

demonstrated that the odd planar Hall signal (O-PHV) exhibits an odd symmetry
with the application of an external magnetic field which motivates us to
develop a reading mechanism for detecting magnetization switching of in-plane
magnetized type-X devices. We verified our DC-based reading mechanism in the
Pt/Co/NiFe/Pt stack where a thin Co layer is inserted to create dissimilar
interfaces about the NiFe layer. Remarkably, the current-induced in-plane

successfully employed the O-PHV method to detect the current-induced

rendering photo-realistic novel view images from a monocular RGB video of a

observation spaces to a common canonical space for rendering, dynamic NeRF does
not model the change of the reflected color during the warping. As a result,
this approach often fails drastically on challenging specular objects in
motion. We address this limitation by reformulating the neural radiance field
function to be conditioned on surface position and orientation in the
observation space. This allows the specular surface at different poses to keep
the different reflected colors when mapped to the common canonical space.
Additionally, we add the mask of moving objects to guide the deformation field.
As the specular surface changes color during motion, the mask mitigates the
problem of failure to find temporal correspondences with only RGB supervision.
We evaluate our model based on the novel view synthesis quality with a
self-collected dataset of different moving specular objects in realistic
environments. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the reconstruction quality of moving specular objects

execution stack. Unstable execution environments can disrupt the availability
of blockchain nodes interfaces, resulting in downtime for users. This paper
introduces the concept of N-version Blockchain nodes. This new type of node
relies on simultaneous execution of different implementations of the same
blockchain protocol, in the line of Avizienis' N-version programming vision. We
design and implement an N-version blockchain node prototype in the context of
Ethereum, called N-ETH. We show that N-ETH is able to mitigate the effects of
unstable execution environments and significantly enhance availability under
environment faults. To simulate unstable execution environments, we perform
fault injection at the system-call level. Our results show that existing
Ethereum node implementations behave asymmetrically under identical instability
scenarios. N-ETH leverages this asymmetric behavior available in the diverse
implementations of Ethereum nodes to provide increased availability, even under
our most aggressive fault-injection strategies. We are the first to validate
the relevance of N-version design in the domain of blockchain infrastructure.
From an industrial perspective, our results are of utmost importance for
businesses operating blockchain nodes, including Google, ConsenSys, and many
other major blockchain companies.

biomarkers associated with patients with Pancreatic Ductal
Adenocarcinoma(PDAC).
  Material and Methods: GSE28735, GSE15471, and GSE62452 are gene microarray
datasets drived from the GEO database, included 153 PDAC samples and 145 normal
samples. By analyzing both Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes (KEGG), for screening DEGs has provided information about their
biological function. Protein-protein interactions (PPI) of DEGs were analyzed
using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database (STRING)
and visualized by Cytoscape. UALCAN was also used to perform prognostic
analyses.
  Results: In Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, we discovered 2264 upregulated
DEGs (uDEGs) and 723 downregulated DEGs (dDEGs). The Gene Ontology (GO)
indicated that extracellular matrix organization, extracellular structure
organization, collagen catabolic process and also the uDEGs are enriched in
focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction by KEGG
analysis. The top ten hub genes were identified from the PPI network: COL1A1,
COL3A1, COL1A2, FN1, COL5A2, ITGA3, FBN1, MET, COL6A3, and BGN. These 10 hub
genes are highly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, according to
GEPIA research. The UALCAN prognostic analysis of the 10 hub genes revealed
that two of the elevated genes, ITGA3 and MET, significantly shortened PDAC
patient survival time. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is linked to Focal
adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and ECM-receptor interaction,
according to Module analysis from the PPI network.
  Conclusion: This investigation identified hub genes and important signal
pathways, which adds to our knowledge of molecular mechanisms and could be
exploited as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for Pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma.

employed in the literature on smart specialization and the product space. We
find that although density is supposed to capture relatedness between a
country's current specialization pattern and potential products that it may
diversify into, density is also correlated strongly to the level of
diversification of the country, and (less strongly) to the ubiquity of the
product. Together, diversity and ubiquity capture 93% of the variance of
density. We split density into a part that corresponds to related variety, and
a part that does not (i.e., unrelated variety). In regressions for predicting
gain or loss of specialization, both these parts are significant. The relative
influence of related variety increases with the level of diversification of the
country: only countries that are already diversified show a strong influence of
related variety. In our empirical analysis, we put equal emphasis on gains and
losses of specialization. Our data show that the specializations that were lost
by a country often represented higher product complexity than the
specializations that were gained over the same period. This suggests that
'smart' specialization should be aimed at preserving (some) existing
specializations in addition to gaining new ones. Our regressions indicate that
the relative roles of related and unrelated variety for explaining loss of
specialization are similar to the case of specialization gains. Finally, we
also show that unrelated variety is also important in indicators that are
derived from density, such as the Economic Complexity Outlook Index.

general formula for the irreducible characters $\zeta^{\la}_{\mu}(q)$ using
partition-valued functions is derived. Meanwhile, an iterative formula on the
indexing partition $\la$ via the Pieri rule is also deduced. As applications,
some compact formulae are given for special partitions and a symmetric property
of the irreducible character is found. We also introduce the spin bitrace as
the analogue of the bitrace for the Hecke algebra and derive its general
combinatorial formula. Tables of irreducible characters are listed for
$n\leq7.$

ground truth of semantic change is difficult to collect. For example, given an
image-text pair about a dog, it is unclear to what extent the similarity
changes when the pixel is changed from dog to cat? To this end, we propose
EqSim, a regularization loss that can be efficiently calculated from any two

application of the hydrostatic pressure. In Weyl semi - metals the tilt of the
dispersion relation cones, k , increases with pressure, so that one is able to
reach type II k > 1 starting from the more conventional type I Weyl semi -
metals k < 1. The microscopic theory of such a transition is constructed. It is
found that upon increasing pressure the I to II transition occurs in two
continuous steps. In the first step the cones of opposite chirality coalesce so
that the chiral symmetry is restored, while the second transition to the Fermi
surface extending throughout the Brillouin zone occurs at higher pressures.
Flattening of the band leads to profound changes in Coulomb screening.

advantages, they are unable to model dependencies in their predictions. Various
works propose solutions to this, but these come at the cost of either requiring

we instead propose to change how CNPs are deployed at test time, without any

independently for every target point, we autoregressively define a joint
predictive distribution using the chain rule of probability, taking inspiration
from the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) literature. We show
that this simple procedure allows factorised Gaussian CNPs to model highly

extensive range of tasks with synthetic and real data, we show that CNPs in
autoregressive (AR) mode not only significantly outperform non-AR CNPs, but are
also competitive with more sophisticated models that are significantly more
computationally expensive and challenging to train. This performance is
remarkable given that AR CNPs are not trained to model joint dependencies. Our
work provides an example of how ideas from neural distribution estimation can
benefit neural processes, and motivates research into the AR deployment of

corrections induced by the standard model particle masses. When the background
value of the scalar field is stabilised at the minimum of the scalar potential,
the scalar field fluctuations only couple quadratically to the massive fields
of the standard model preventing the scalar direct decay into standard model
particles. Cosmologically and prior to the electroweak symmetry breaking, the
scalar field rolls down along its effective potential before eventually
oscillating and settling down at the electroweak minimum. These oscillations
can be at the origin of dark matter due to the initial misalignment of the
scalar field compared to the electroweak minimum, and we find that, when the
mass of the scalar field is less than the eV scale and acts as a condensate
behaving like dark matter on large scales, the scalar particles cannot
thermalise with the standard model thermal bath. As matter couples in a
composition-dependent manner to the oscillating scalar, this could lead to a
violation of the equivalence principle aboard satellites such as the MICROSCOPE
experiment and the next generation of tests of the equivalence principle. Local
gravitational tests are evaded thanks to the weakness of the quadratic coupling
in the dark matter halo, and we find that, around other sources, these dilaton

compact typical BNNs and obtain further close performance through learning
non-repetitive kernels within a binary kernel subspace. Specifically, we regard

While these model-based approaches achieve promising results, they often fail
to learn complex geometric details such as the mouth interior, hair, and
topological changes over time. This paper presents a novel approach to building
highly photorealistic digital head avatars. Our method learns a canonical space
via an implicit function parameterized by a neural network. It leverages
multiresolution hash encoding in the learned feature space, allowing for
high-quality, faster training and high-resolution rendering. At test time, our
method is driven by a monocular RGB video. Here, an image encoder extracts
face-specific features that also condition the learnable canonical space. This
encourages deformation-dependent texture variations during training. We also
propose a novel optical flow based loss that ensures correspondences in the
learned canonical space, thus encouraging artifact-free and temporally
consistent renderings. We show results on challenging facial expressions and
show free-viewpoint renderings at interactive real-time rates for medium image

is discussed extensively in the literature. The complete singular system of the

asymptotically proportional to $1/n$, which indicates a degree {\sl one} of
ill-posedness for this inverse problem. We recall the concept of the degree of
ill-posedness for linear operator equations with compact forward operators in

there is little material available about the analysis of the d-dimensional

support many downstream tasks. Many new coming concepts need to be added to an
existing taxonomy. The traditional taxonomy expansion task aims only at finding
the best position for new coming concepts in the existing taxonomy. However,
they have two drawbacks when being applied to the real-scenarios. The previous
methods suffer from low-efficiency since they waste much time when most of the
new coming concepts are indeed noisy concepts. They also suffer from
low-effectiveness since they collect training samples only from the existing
taxonomy, which limits the ability of the model to mine more hypernym-hyponym
relationships among real concepts. This paper proposes a pluggable framework
called Generative Adversarial Network for Taxonomy Entering Evaluation (GANTEE)
to alleviate these drawbacks. A generative adversarial network is designed in
this framework by discriminative models to alleviate the first drawback and the
generative model to alleviate the second drawback. Two discriminators are used
in GANTEE to provide long-term and short-term rewards, respectively. Moreover,
to further improve the efficiency, pre-trained language models are used to
retrieve the representation of the concepts quickly. The experiments on three
real-world large-scale datasets with two different languages show that GANTEE
improves the performance of the existing taxonomy expansion methods in both
effectiveness and efficiency.

existing VIReID datasets are captured under sufficient illumination without
significant light changes. Thus, we provide a low-light cross-modality (LLCM)

risks are compounded for people of lower socioeconomic status, those who have

coefficients between population demographic features and cumulative cases and

strategy to generate optimal mask ratios at distinct scales for compact

data-abundant computer vision tasks by capturing long-range dependencies among
local features. However, under few-shot learning (FSL) settings on small
datasets with only a few labeled data, ViT tends to overfit and suffers from
severe performance degradation due to its absence of CNN-alike inductive bias.
Previous works in FSL avoid such problem either through the help of
self-supervised auxiliary losses, or through the dextile uses of label
information under supervised settings. But the gap between self-supervised and
supervised few-shot Transformers is still unfilled. Inspired by recent advances
in self-supervised knowledge distillation and masked image modeling (MIM), we
propose a novel Supervised Masked Knowledge Distillation model (SMKD) for
few-shot Transformers which incorporates label information into
self-distillation frameworks. Compared with previous self-supervised methods,
we allow intra-class knowledge distillation on both class and patch tokens, and
introduce the challenging task of masked patch tokens reconstruction across
intra-class images. Experimental results on four few-shot classification
benchmark datasets show that our method with simple design outperforms previous
methods by a large margin and achieves a new start-of-the-art. Detailed

Thanks to employing group-equivariant CNNs, our method effectively learns to
obtain rotation-equivariant features and their orientations explicitly, without
having to perform sophisticated data augmentations. The resultant features and
their orientations are further processed by group aligning, a novel invariant
mapping technique that shifts the group-equivariant features by their
orientations along the group dimension. Our group aligning technique achieves
rotation-invariance without any collapse of the group dimension and thus
eschews loss of discriminability. The proposed method is trained end-to-end in
a self-supervised manner, where we use an orientation alignment loss for the
orientation estimation and a contrastive descriptor loss for robust local
descriptors to geometric/photometric variations. Our method demonstrates
state-of-the-art matching accuracy among existing rotation-invariant

  Conference on Sensor Systems and Software",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Concept drift detection has attracted considerable attention due to its
importance in many real-world applications such as health monitoring and fault
diagnosis. Conventionally, most advanced approaches will be of poor performance
when the evaluation criteria of the environment has changed (i.e. concept
drift), either can only detect and adapt to virtual drift. In this paper, we
propose a new approach to detect real-drift in the chunk data stream with
limited annotations based on concept confusion. When a new data chunk arrives,
we use both real labels and pseudo labels to update the model after prediction
and drift detection. In this context, the model will be confused and yields
prediction difference once drift occurs. We then adopt cosine similarity to
measure the difference. And an adaptive threshold method is proposed to find
the abnormal value. Experiments show that our method has a low false alarm rate
and false negative rate with the utilization of different classifiers.

  of Neural Networks","Accepted to the International Symposium on Cyber Security, Cryptology
  and Machine Learning 2023 (CSCML)",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model extraction attacks have been widely applied, which can normally be used
to recover confidential parameters of neural networks for multiple layers.
Recently, side-channel analysis of neural networks allows parameter extraction
even for networks with several multiple deep layers with high effectiveness. It
is therefore of interest to implement a certain level of protection against
these attacks. In this paper, we propose a desynchronization-based
countermeasure that makes the timing analysis of activation functions harder.
We analyze the timing properties of several activation functions and design the
desynchronization in a way that the dependency on the input and the activation
type is hidden. We experimentally verify the effectiveness of the
countermeasure on a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller and employ a t-test to
show the side-channel information leakage. The overhead ultimately depends on
the number of neurons in the fully-connected layer, for example, in the case of
4096 neurons in VGG-19, the overheads are between 2.8% and 11%.

sixth-generation (6G) technology of wireless local area networks (WLANs) by
improving the fundamental performance of latency, throughput, and so on. The
main technical feature of orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA)
supports multi-users to transmit respective data concurrently via the
corresponding access points (APs). However, the conventional IEEE 802.11
protocol for Wi-Fi roaming selects the target AP only depending on received
signal strength indication (RSSI) which is obtained by the received Response
frame from the APs. In the long term, it may lead to congestion in a single
channel under the scenarios of dense users further increasing the association
delay and packet drop rate, even reducing the quality of service (QoS) of the
overall system. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent deep Q-learning for
fast roaming (MADAR) algorithm to effectively minimize the latency during the
station roaming for Smart Warehouse in Wi-Fi 6 system. The MADAR algorithm
considers not only RSSI but also channel state information (CSI), and through
online neural network learning and weighting adjustments to maximize the reward
of the action selected from Epsilon-Greedy. Compared to existing benchmark
methods, the MADAR algorithm has been demonstrated for improved roaming latency
by analyzing the simulation result and realistic dataset.

  Counting and Localization using Wi-Fi CSI",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Channel State Information (CSI) is widely adopted as a feature for indoor
localization. Taking advantage of the abundant information from the CSI, people
can be accurately sensed even without equipped devices. However, the
positioning error increases severely in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) regions.
Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been introduced to improve signal
coverage in NLoS areas, which can re-direct and enhance reflective signals with
massive meta-material elements. In this paper, we have proposed a
Transformer-based RIS-assisted device-free sensing for joint people counting
and localization (WiRiS) system to precisely predict the number of people and
their corresponding locations through configuring RIS. A series of predefined
RIS beams is employed to create inputs of fingerprinting CSI features as
sequence-to-sequence learning database for Transformer. We have evaluated the
performance of proposed WiRiS system in both ray-tracing simulators and
experiments. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that people
counting accuracy exceeds 90%, and the localization error can achieve the
centimeter-level, which outperforms the existing benchmarks without employment
of RIS.

  Error Vector Spectrum in Wi-Fi Systems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The demand for device-free indoor localization using commercial Wi-Fi devices
has rapidly increased in various fields due to its convenience and versatile
applications. However, random frequency offset (RFO) in wireless channels poses
challenges to the accuracy of indoor localization when using fluctuating
channel state information (CSI). To mitigate the RFO problem, an error vector
spectrum (EVS) is conceived thanks to its higher resolution of signal and
robustness to RFO. To address these challenges, this paper proposed a novel
error vector assisted learning (EVAL) for device-free indoor localization. The
proposed EVAL scheme employs deep neural networks to classify the location of a
person in the indoor environment by extracting ample channel features from the
physical layer signals. We conducted realistic experiments based on OpenWiFi
project to extract both EVS and CSI to examine the performance of different
device-free localization techniques. Experimental results show that our
proposed EVAL scheme outperforms conventional machine learning methods and
benchmarks utilizing either CSI amplitude or phase information. Compared to
most existing CSI-based localization schemes, a new paradigm with higher
positioning accuracy by adopting EVS is revealed by our proposed EVAL system.

learns using an autoregressive causal language modeling loss by predicting the
words spoken in YouTube videos. Finally, we evaluate on standard downstream
benchmarks by training fully connected prediction heads for each task. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first use of multiple frozen SOTA models as
encoders in an ""embedding -> backbone -> prediction head"" design pattern - all
others have trained their own joint encoder models. Additionally, we include
more modalities than the current SOTA, Merlot Reserve, by adding explicit Scene
Graph information. For these two reasons, we believe it could combine the
world's best open-source models to achieve SOTA performance. Initial
experiments demonstrate the model is learning appropriately, but more
experimentation and compute is necessary, and already in progress, to realize
our loftier goals. Alongside this work, we build on the YT-20M dataset,
reproducing it and adding 25,000 personally selected YouTube videos to its

causing flight rerouting and cancellations, as well as passenger travel delays.
With the growing frequency of extreme weather hazards, it is essential to
understand the extent to which disruptions in flights and subsequent
cancellations impact passenger delays. This study focuses on quantifying the
impacts of a recent extreme weather event (2022 Winter Storm Elliott) on the
U.S. air transportation system by investigating passenger delays measured based
on dwell time at airports using privacy-preserving location-based datasets. The
study determines total dwell time and dwell time per anonymized user at
airports during the extreme weather event and computes the impact based on
changes in values compared to the same period in the previous year. The results
show that the storm event caused passengers significant delays, as
characterized by a substantial increase in airport dwell time. Factor analysis
shows that airports with a greater passenger flow and a greater portion of
flights from decentralized airlines aggravated passengers delays during the
winter storm. The vulnerability of airports was mainly due to the direct storm
exposure, and the influence of network cascading impacts were limited. The
findings of this study provide novel insights and quantification of the extent
of extreme weather impacts on air transportation at individual airports and
national levels. These outcomes could inform airport owners and operators, as
well as airlines, about the extent of vulnerability and provide useful
information for weather-related risk assessment of air transportation systems.

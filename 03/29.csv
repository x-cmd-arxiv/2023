probability of nano - or microscale particles in small cavities such as, e.g.,
confined submicron particles in fiber beds of high-efficiency filter media or
ions/small molecules in confined cellular structures. Here we address this
issue based on numerical study of the escape kinetics of inertial Brownian
colloidal particles from various types of cavities with single and multiple
pores. We consider both the situations of strong and weak viscous damping. Our
simulation results show that as long as the thermal length is larger than the
cavity size the mean exit time remains insensitive to the medium viscous
damping. On further increasing damping strength, a linear relation between
escape rate and damping strength emerges gradually. This result is in sharp
contrast to the energy barrier crossing dynamics where the escape rate exhibits
a turnover behavior as a function of the damping strength. Moreover, in the
ballistic regime, the exit rate is directly proportional to the pore width and
the thermal velocity. All these attributes are insensitive to the cavity as
well as the pore structures. Further, we show that the effects of pore
structure variation on the escape kinetics are conspicuously different in the
low damping regimes compared to the overdamped situation. Apart from direct
applications in biology and nanotechnology, our simulation results can
potentially be used to understand diffusion of living or artificial micro/nano
objects, such as bacteria, virus, Janus Particle etc. where memory effects play
dictating roles.

to: 1. the cubically-increasing overhead in processing 3D data; 2. the
optimization difficulties from data scarcity and sparsity. Previous work has
taken the first step to scale up the kernel size from 3x3x3 to 7x7x7 by
introducing block-shared weights. However, to reduce the feature variations
within a block, it only employs modest block size and fails to achieve larger
kernels like the 21x21x21. To address this issue, we propose a new method,
called LinK, to achieve a wider-range perception receptive field in a
convolution-like manner with two core designs. The first is to replace the
static kernel matrix with a linear kernel generator, which adaptively provides
weights only for non-empty voxels. The second is to reuse the pre-computed
aggregation results in the overlapped blocks to reduce computation complexity.
The proposed method successfully enables each voxel to perceive context within
a range of 21x21x21. Extensive experiments on two basic perception tasks, 3D
object detection and 3D semantic segmentation, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. Notably, we rank 1st on the public leaderboard of the 3D detection
benchmark of nuScenes (LiDAR track), by simply incorporating a LinK-based
backbone into the basic detector, CenterPoint. We also boost the strong
segmentation baseline's mIoU with 2.7% in the SemanticKITTI test set. Code is

color is uncorrelated with halo age in the LRG regime. Both the optical and IR

address the pose estimation of novel objects we also present a new approach for
training pose estimation. The typical solution is a single model trained for
pose estimation of a specific object in any scenario. This has several
drawbacks: training a model for each object is time-consuming, energy
consuming, and by excluding the scenario information the task becomes more
difficult. In this paper, we present the opposite solution; a scenario-specific
pose estimation method for novel objects that do not require retraining. The
network is trained on 1500 objects and is able to learn a generalized solution.
We demonstrate that the network is able to correctly predict novel objects, and
demonstrate the ability of the network to perform outside of the trained class.
We believe that the demonstrated method is a valuable solution for many
real-world scenarios. Code and trained network will be made available after

reliability of standard numerical methods for potential gains in accuracy
and/or speed. The only way for a solver to guarantee that it outputs the exact
solution is to use a convergent method in the limit that the grid spacing
$\Delta x$ and timestep $\Delta t$ approach zero. Machine learned solvers,
which learn to update the solution at large $\Delta x$ and/or $\Delta t$, can
never guarantee perfect accuracy. Some amount of error is inevitable, so the
question becomes: how do we constrain machine learned solvers to give us the
sorts of errors that we are willing to tolerate? In this paper, we design more
reliable machine learned PDE solvers by preserving discrete analogues of the
continuous invariants of the underlying PDE. Examples of such invariants
include conservation of mass, conservation of energy, the second law of
thermodynamics, and/or non-negative density. Our key insight is simple: to
preserve invariants, at each timestep apply an error-correcting algorithm to
the update rule. Though this strategy is different from how standard solvers
preserve invariants, it is necessary to retain the flexibility that allows
machine learned solvers to be accurate at large $\Delta x$ and/or $\Delta t$.
This strategy can be applied to any autoregressive solver for any
time-dependent PDE in arbitrary geometries with arbitrary boundary conditions.
Although this strategy is very general, the specific error-correcting
algorithms need to be tailored to the invariants of the underlying equations as
well as to the solution representation and time-stepping scheme of the solver.
The error-correcting algorithms we introduce have two key properties. First, by
preserving the right invariants they guarantee numerical stability. Second, in
closed or periodic systems they do so without degrading the accuracy of an
already-accurate solver.

habitable zones based on primary conditions such as temperature and the

zones is proposed, with constraints set by three principal characteristics:
capacity, energy, and instantiation (or substrate). Computational zones
naturally combine traditional habitability factors, including those associated
with biological function that incorporate the chemical milieu, constraints on
nutrients and free energy, as well as element availability. Two example
applications are presented by examining the fundamental thermodynamic work
efficiency and Landauer limit of photon-driven biological computation on
planetary surfaces and of generalized computation in stellar energy capture

Monte-Carlo simulations with a PGSE sequence in numerical substrates made of
spherical cells and their extracellular space for a range of membrane
permeability. From these signals, the properties of the substrates were
inferred using both BS and CEXI models. Results: CEXI outperformed the
impermeable model by providing more stable estimates cell size and
intracellular volume fraction that were diffusion time-independent. Notably,
CEXI accurately estimated the exchange time for low to moderate permeability
levels previously reported in other studies ($\kappa<25\mu m/s$). However, in
highly permeable substrates ($\kappa=50\mu m/s$), the estimated parameters were
less stable, particularly the diffusion coefficients. Conclusion: This study
highlights the importance of modeling the exchange time to accurately quantify
microstructure properties in permeable cellular substrates. Future studies
should evaluate CEXI in clinical applications such as lymph nodes, investigate
exchange time as a potential biomarker of tumor severity, and develop more
appropriate tissue models that account for anisotropic diffusion and highly
permeable membranes.

nonlinear law for reaction-diffusion processes, which are modeled by general
form semilinear parabolic equations. We do not assume that any solutions to
these equations are known a priori, in which case the problem has a well known
gauge symmetry. We determine, under additional assumptions, the semilinear term
up to this symmetry in a time-dependent anisotropic case modeled on Riemannian
manifolds, and for partial data measurements on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Moreover, we
present cases where it is possible to exploit the nonlinear interaction to
break the gauge symmetry. This leads to full determination results of the
nonlinear term. As an application, we show that it is possible to give a full
resolution to classes of inverse source problems of determining a source term
and nonlinear terms simultaneously. This is in strict contrast to inverse
source problems for corresponding linear equations, which always have the gauge
symmetry. We also consider a Carleman estimate with boundary terms based on
intrinsic properties of parabolic equations.

detection where the correlation of multiple actors makes their action
recognition challenging. Existing studies model each actor and scene relation
to improve action recognition. However, the scene variations and background
interference limit the effectiveness of this relation modeling. In this paper,
we propose to select actor-related scene context, rather than directly leverage
raw video scenario, to improve relation modeling. We develop a Cycle
Actor-Context Relation network (CycleACR) where there is a symmetric graph that
models the actor and context relations in a bidirectional form. Our CycleACR
consists of the Actor-to-Context Reorganization (A2C-R) that collects actor
features for context feature reorganizations, and the Context-to-Actor
Enhancement (C2A-E) that dynamically utilizes reorganized context features for
actor feature enhancement. Compared to existing designs that focus on C2A-E,
our CycleACR introduces A2C-R for a more effective relation modeling. This
modeling advances our CycleACR to achieve state-of-the-art performance on two
popular action detection datasets (i.e., AVA and UCF101-24). We also provide
ablation studies and visualizations as well to show how our cycle actor-context
relation modeling improves video action detection. Code is available at

but had never been observed in a starless core. The addition of these three new
pieces to the puzzle of complex organic molecules in cold interstellar clouds

made in the framework of QUIJOTE, a deep line survey of TMC-1 in the Q band

densities of (1.1 +/- 0.3)e12 cm-2 for C2H5OH, (1.4 +/- 0.6)e11 cm-2 for
CH3COCH3, and (1.9 +/- 0.7)e11 cm-2 for C2H5CHO. The formation of these three

chemical model which includes gas and ice chemistry. The calculated abundances
at a time around 2e5 yr are in reasonable agreement with the values derived
from the observations. The formation mechanisms of these molecules in our
chemical model are as follows. Ethanol is formed on grains by addition of
atomic carbon on methanol followed by hydrogenation and non-thermal desorption.
Acetone and propanal are produced by the gas-phase reaction between atomic
oxygen and two different isomers of the C3H7 radical, where the latter follows
from the hydrogenation of C3 on grains followed by non-thermal desorption. A
gas-phase route involving the formation of (CH3)2COH+ through several

their errors. Recent works have shown that a fixed bias can be exploited to
improve error tolerance by statically arranging the errors in beneficial
configurations. In some cases an error bias can be dynamically reconfigurable,
an example being linear optical fusion where the basis of a fusion failure can
be chosen before the measurement is made. Here we introduce methods for
increasing error tolerance in this setting by using classical decision-making
to adaptively choose the bias in measurements as a fault tolerance protocol
proceeds. We study this technique in the setting of linear optical fusion based
quantum computing (FBQC). We provide examples demonstrating that by dynamically
arranging erasures, the loss tolerance can be tripled when compared to a static
arrangement of biased errors while using the same quantum resources: we show
that for the best FBQC architecture of Bartolucci et al. (2023) the threshold
increases from $2.7\%$ to $7.5\%$ per photon with the same resource state by
using dynamic biasing. Our method does not require any specific code structure
beyond having a syndrome graph representation. We have chosen to illustrate
these techniques using an architecture which is otherwise identical to that in
Bartolucci et al. (2023), but deployed together with other techniques, such as
different fusion networks, higher loss thresholds are possible.

analysis tasks. However, for chemotherapy response prediction, the
effectiveness between different kinds of 2D and 3D features are not
comprehensively assessed, especially in ovarian cancer-related applications.
This investigation aims to accomplish such a comprehensive evaluation. For this
purpose, CT images were collected retrospectively from 188 advanced-stage
ovarian cancer patients. All the metastatic tumors that occurred in each
patient were segmented and then processed by a set of six filters. Next, three
categories of features, namely geometric, density, and texture features, were
calculated from both the filtered results and the original segmented tumors,
generating a total of 1595 and 1403 features for the 3D and 2D tumors,
respectively. In addition to the conventional single-slice 2D and full-volume
3D tumor features, we also computed the incomplete-3D tumor features, which
were achieved by sequentially adding one individual CT slice and calculating
the corresponding features. Support vector machine (SVM) based prediction
models were developed and optimized for each feature set. 5-fold
cross-validation was used to assess the performance of each individual model.
The results show that the 2D feature-based model achieved an AUC (area under
the ROC curve [receiver operating characteristic]) of 0.84+-0.02. When adding
more slices, the AUC first increased to reach the maximum and then gradually
decreased to 0.86+-0.02. The maximum AUC was yielded when adding two adjacent
slices, with a value of 0.91+-0.01. This initial result provides meaningful
information for optimizing machine learning-based decision-making support tools
in the future.

Gaia and PARSEC isochrones to constrain their evolutionary stage. Our sample
covers a wide range of stellar masses from 1 to more than 6 solar masses where
the majority of the masses are above 2 solar masses. We have found 14 canonical
Li-rich giant stars which have experienced the first dredge-up. This
corresponds to 6% of our total sample, which is higher than what is typically
found for field stars. Apart from the canonical limit, we use the maximum Li
abundance of the progenitor stars as a criterion for Li enrichment. We find Li
enhancement also among eight stars which have passed the first dredge up and
show strong Li lines based on the fact that stars at the same evolutionary
stage in the same cluster have significantly different Li abundances. We
confirm that giants with higher Li abundance correspond to a higher fraction of
fast-rotating giants, suggesting a connection between Li enhancement and
stellar rotation as predicted by stellar models. Our Li-rich giants are found
in various evolutionary stages implying that no unique Li production mechanism
is responsible for Li enrichment but rather different intrinsic or external
mechanisms can be simultaneously at play.

Scanning Tunneling Microscopy and Spectroscopy (STM/STS) has the ability to

Inconsistent AI models are considered brittle and untrustworthy by human users

dependencies on their outputs. Measuring consistency between very heterogeneous
tasks that might include outputs in different modalities is challenging since
it is difficult to determine if the predictions are consistent with one
another. As a solution, we introduce a benchmark dataset, COCOCON, where we use
contrast sets created by modifying test instances for multiple tasks in small

for measuring if a model is consistent by ranking the original and perturbed

applications such as food handling and robotic surgery. Unlike rigid and
articulated objects, 3D deformable objects have infinite degrees of freedom.
Fully defining their state requires 3D deformation and stress fields, which are
exceptionally difficult to analytically compute or experimentally measure.
Thus, evaluating grasp candidates for grasp planning typically requires
accurate, but slow 3D finite element method (FEM) simulation. Sampling-based
grasp planning is often impractical, as it requires evaluation of a large
number of grasp candidates. Gradient-based grasp planning can be more
efficient, but requires a differentiable model to synthesize optimal grasps
from initial candidates. Differentiable FEM simulators may fill this role, but
are typically no faster than standard FEM. In this work, we propose learning a
predictive graph neural network (GNN), DefGraspNets, to act as our
differentiable model. We train DefGraspNets to predict 3D stress and
deformation fields based on FEM-based grasp simulations. DefGraspNets not only
runs up to 1500 times faster than the FEM simulator, but also enables fast
gradient-based grasp optimization over 3D stress and deformation metrics. We
design DefGraspNets to align with real-world grasp planning practices and
demonstrate generalization across multiple test sets, including real-world
experiments.

By comparing the local density of states (DOS) information gained from STS for

send version updates over a fading multiple access channel (MAC) to an access

according to an exogenous arrival process, and a new version renders all
previous versions obsolete. As energy harvesting imposes a time-varying peak
power constraint, it is not possible to deliver all the bits of a version
instantaneously. Accordingly, the AP chooses the objective of minimizing a
finite-horizon time average expectation of the product of importance weight and
a convex increasing function of the number of remaining bits of a version to be
transmitted at each time instant. The objective enables importance-aware
delivery of as many bits, as soon as possible. In this setup, the AP optimizes
the objective function subject to an achievable rate-region constraint of the
MAC and energy constraints at the users, by deciding the transmit power and the
number of bits to be transmitted by each user. We obtain a Markov Decision

rigidity result, showing that, under suitable scaling assumptions, the

single network due to resolution issues, i.e., the face and hands are usually
located in extremely small regions. Existing works usually detect hands and
faces, enlarge their resolution to feed in a specific network to predict the
parameter, and finally fuse the results. While this copy-paste pipeline can
capture the fine-grained details of the face and hands, the connections between
different parts cannot be easily recovered in late fusion, leading to
implausible 3D rotation and unnatural pose. In this work, we propose a
one-stage pipeline for expressive whole-body mesh recovery, named OSX, without
separate networks for each part. Specifically, we design a Component Aware
Transformer (CAT) composed of a global body encoder and a local face/hand
decoder. The encoder predicts the body parameters and provides a high-quality
feature map for the decoder, which performs a feature-level upsample-crop
scheme to extract high-resolution part-specific features and adopt
keypoint-guided deformable attention to estimate hand and face precisely. The
whole pipeline is simple yet effective without any manual post-processing and
naturally avoids implausible prediction. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of OSX. Lastly, we build a large-scale Upper-Body dataset
(UBody) with high-quality 2D and 3D whole-body annotations. It contains persons
with partially visible bodies in diverse real-life scenarios to bridge the gap

These conditions effectively encapsulate the low-level stability limitations in

how the available primitives can be safely composed online in a receding

Elgindi arXiv:2207.04556v1 developed for scalar equations. We provide a large
class of initial data with velocity and density of small $W^{1,
\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ size, for which the horizontal density gradient has a
strong $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm inflation in infinitesimal time, while
the vorticity and the vertical density gradient remain bounded. Furthermore,
exploiting the three-dimensional version of Elgindi's decomposition of the
Biot-Savart law, we apply the method to the three-dimensional axisymmetric
Euler equations with swirl and away from the vertical axis, showing that a
large class of initial data with velocity field uniformly bounded in $W^{1,
\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ provides a solution whose swirl component has a strong
$W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm inflation in infinitesimal time, while the
potential vorticity remains bounded at least for small times. Finally, the
$W^{1,\infty}$-norm inflation of the swirl (and the $L^{\infty}$-norm inflation
of the vorticity field) is quantified from below by an explicit lower bound
which depends on time, the size of the data and it is valid for small times.

neural models are trained to an output distribution that is a vector with a

smoothing converts the correct prediction location to something slightly less
than 1, then distributes the remainder to the other elements such that they are
slightly greater than 0. A conceptual explanation behind label smoothing is
that it helps prevent a neural model from becoming ""overconfident"" by forcing
it to consider alternatives, even if only slightly. Label smoothing has been
shown to help several areas of language generation, yet typically requires
considerable tuning and testing to achieve the optimal results. This tuning and
testing has not been reported for neural source code summarization - a growing
research area in software engineering that seeks to generate natural language
descriptions of source code behavior. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect
of label smoothing on several baselines in neural code summarization, and

accretion from a white dwarf in a very eccentric orbit about the central
massive black hole. Evolution under gravitational radiation losses reduces the
separation and eccentricity. I note that below a critical eccentricity $e_{\rm
crit} \simeq 0.97$, the accretion disc's viscous timescale at pericentre
passage is probably longer than the orbital period $P$, and periodic eruptive
behaviour is no longer possible. These QPE descendant systems (QPEDs) are then
likely to produce quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) rather than eruptions,
varying more smoothly over the orbital cycle, with duty cycles $\sim1$. I
identify 2XMM J123103.2+110648 ($P \simeq 3.9$~hr) and (more tentatively) RE
J1034+396 ($P \simeq 1$~hr) as candidate systems of this type, and find
agreement with their deduced eccentricities $e < e_{\rm crit}$. The absence of
eruptions and the lower accretion luminosities resulting from the smaller
gravitational radiation losses may make QPED systems harder to discover.
Ultimately they must evolve to have viscous times much longer than the orbital
period, and either remain steady, or possibly have infrequent but large
outbursts. The latter systems would be massive analogues of the soft X-ray
transients produced by low stellar-mass X-ray binaries.

merges clusters of source identities which exhibit similar distributions with
the target domain. The second stage, subject to a budget, then selects
identities and their images from the Stage I output, to control the size of the
resulting training set for efficient training. The two steps provide us with
training sets 80\% smaller than the source pool while achieving a similar or
even higher re-ID accuracy. These training sets are also shown to be superior
to a few existing search methods such as random sampling and greedy sampling
under the same budget on training data size. If we release the budget, training
sets resulting from the first stage alone allow even higher re-ID accuracy. We

existing sequence models to planning, in which we wish to obtain a trajectory
of actions to reach some goal, is less straightforward. The typical
autoregressive generation procedures of sequence models preclude sequential
refinement of earlier steps, which limits the effectiveness of a predicted
plan. In this paper, we suggest an approach towards integrating planning with
sequence models based on the idea of iterative energy minimization, and
illustrate how such a procedure leads to improved RL performance across
different tasks. We train a masked language model to capture an implicit energy
function over trajectories of actions, and formulate planning as finding a
trajectory of actions with minimum energy. We illustrate how this procedure
enables improved performance over recent approaches across BabyAI and Atari
environments. We further demonstrate unique benefits of our iterative
optimization procedure, involving new task generalization, test-time
constraints adaptation, and the ability to compose plans together. Project

localize unknown defects in query images. These detectors are trained on

most normalities, they are often mistaken for anomalies by existing anomaly
detectors. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet efficient method:
\textbf{H}ard Nominal \textbf{E}xample-aware \textbf{T}emplate \textbf{M}utual
\textbf{M}atching (HETMM). Specifically, \textit{HETMM} aims to construct a
robust prototype-based decision boundary, which can precisely distinguish
between hard-nominal examples and anomalies, yielding fewer false-positive and
missed-detection rates. Moreover, \textit{HETMM} mutually explores the
anomalies in two directions between queries and the template set, and thus it
is capable to capture the logical anomalies. This is a significant advantage
over most anomaly detectors that frequently fail to detect logical anomalies.
Additionally, to meet the speed-accuracy demands, we further propose
\textbf{P}ixel-level \textbf{T}emplate \textbf{S}election (PTS) to streamline
the original template set. \textit{PTS} selects cluster centres and
hard-nominal examples to form a tiny set, maintaining the original decision

inserting novel samples, which may promptly address some incremental learning

hypothesis to test in a system of evolving foraging agents controlled by neural
networks that can adapt agents' dynamical regime throughout evolution.
Surprisingly, we find that all populations that discover solutions, evolve to
be subcritical. By a resilience analysis, we find that there are still benefits
of starting the evolution in the critical regime. Namely, initially critical
agents maintain their fitness level under environmental changes (for example,
in the lifespan) and degrade gracefully when their genome is perturbed. At the
same time, initially subcritical agents, even when evolved to the same fitness,
are often inadequate to withstand the changes in the lifespan and degrade
catastrophically with genetic perturbations. Furthermore, we find the optimal
distance to criticality depends on the task complexity. To test it we introduce
a hard and simple task: for the hard task, agents evolve closer to criticality
whereas more subcritical solutions are found for the simple task. We verify
that our results are independent of the selected evolutionary mechanisms by
testing them on two principally different approaches: a genetic algorithm and
an evolutionary strategy. In summary, our study suggests that although optimal
behaviour in the simple task is obtained in a subcritical regime, initializing
near criticality is important to be efficient at finding optimal solutions for

number of views are available. To complement the lack of 3D information,
depth-based models, such as DSNeRF and MonoSDF, explicitly assume the
availability of accurate depth maps of multiple views. They linearly scale the
accurate depth maps as supervision to guide the predicted depth of few-shot
NeRFs. However, accurate depth maps are difficult and expensive to capture due
to wide-range depth distances in the wild.
  In this work, we present a new Sparse-view NeRF (SparseNeRF) framework that
exploits depth priors from real-world inaccurate observations. The inaccurate
depth observations are either from pre-trained depth models or coarse depth
maps of consumer-level depth sensors. Since coarse depth maps are not strictly
scaled to the ground-truth depth maps, we propose a simple yet effective
constraint, a local depth ranking method, on NeRFs such that the expected depth
ranking of the NeRF is consistent with that of the coarse depth maps in local
patches. To preserve the spatial continuity of the estimated depth of NeRF, we
further propose a spatial continuity constraint to encourage the consistency of
the expected depth continuity of NeRF with coarse depth maps. Surprisingly,
with simple depth ranking constraints, SparseNeRF outperforms all
state-of-the-art few-shot NeRF methods (including depth-based models) on

dynamics is dominated by an intricate interplay between three key concepts of
modern physics: topology, nonlinearity, and spontaneous symmetry breaking. The
experiment is based on a two-mode coherently-driven optical resonator in which
photons interact through the Kerr nonlinearity. In presence of a phase defect
between the modes, a nonlinear attractor develops, which confers a synthetic
M\""obius topology to the modal structure of the system. That topology is
associated with an inherently protected exchange symmetry between the modes,
enabling the realization of spontaneous symmetry breaking in ideal, bias-free,
conditions without any fine tuning of parameters. The dynamic manifests itself
by a periodic alternation of the modes from one resonator roundtrip to the next
reminiscent of period-doubling. This extends to a range of localized structures
in the form of domain walls, bright solitons, and breathers, which have all
been observed with remarkable long term stability. A rigorous testing of the

the robustness of the exchange symmetry in our experiment. Our results and

Competitive pressures among corporations and militaries will give rise to AI

agents have intelligence that exceeds that of humans, this could lead to
humanity losing control of its future. More abstractly, we argue that natural

This Darwinian logic could also apply to artificial agents, as agents may
eventually be better able to persist into the future if they behave selfishly

catastrophic risks. To counteract these risks and evolutionary forces, we
consider interventions such as carefully designing AI agents' intrinsic

evolve equal-mass binaries from initial separations of $100 GM/c^2$ until

evolution of each binary decouples from that of their circumbinary disk, and
precisely resolve the flow of gas throughout the inspiral. We demonstrate
analytically and numerically that timescale-based predictions overestimate the
binary separations at which decoupling occurs by factors of $\sim3$, and
illustrate the utility of a velocity-based decoupling criterion. High-viscosity
($\nu\gtrsim0.03 GM/c$) circumbinary systems decouple late ($a_b\lesssim 15
GM/c^2$) and have qualitatively similar morphologies near merger to
circumbinary systems with constant binary separations. Lower-viscosity
circumbinary disks decouple earlier and exhibit qualitatively different
accretion flows, which lead to precipitously decreasing accretion onto the
binary. If detected, such a decrease may unambiguously identify the host galaxy
of an ongoing event within a LISA error volume. We illustrate how accretion
amplitude and variability evolve as binaries gradually decouple from their
circumbinary disks, and where decoupling occurs over the course of binary
inspirals in the LISA band. We show that, even when dynamically negligible, gas

reasonably (marginally) resolved clouds, possible analogs of high-velocity
clouds (HVCs). There is a large variation in cloud abundance from galaxy to
galaxy, and the physical properties of clouds that we explore -- mass, size,
metallicity, pressure, and kinematics -- are also diverse. We quantify the
distributions of cloud properties and cloud-background contrasts, providing
cosmological inputs for idealized simulations. Clouds characteristically have
sub-solar metallicities, diverse shapes, small overdensities ($\chi = n_{\rm
cold} / n_{\rm hot} \lesssim 10$), are mostly inflowing, and have sub-virial
rotation. At TNG50 resolution, resolved clouds have median masses of $\sim
10^6\,\rm{M_\odot}$ and sizes of $\sim 10$ kpc. Larger clouds are well
converged numerically, while the abundance of the smallest clouds increases
with resolution, as expected. In TNG50 MW-like haloes, clouds are slightly
(severely) under-pressurised relative to their surroundings with respect to
total (thermal) pressure, implying that magnetic fields may be important.
Clouds are not distributed uniformly throughout the CGM, but are clustered
around other clouds, often near baryon-rich satellite galaxies. This suggests
that at least some clouds originate from satellites, via direct ram-pressure
stripping or otherwise. Finally, we compare with observations of intermediate
and high velocity clouds from the real Milky Way halo. TNG50 shows a similar

Universe, ending the ''Dark Ages''. During this epoch, the earliest luminous
sources were enshrouded in neutral and pristine gas, which was gradually
ionised in a process called ''reionisation''. Hence, one of the brightest
emission lines in star-forming galaxies, Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$), was
predicted to emerge only towards the end of the epoch of reionisation, about
one billion years after the Big Bang. However, this picture has been challenged
over the past decade by the surprising detection of Ly-$\alpha$ in galaxies
less than 500 million years old. Here we show, by taking advantage of both
high-resolution and high-sensitivity images from the James Webb Space Telescope
programs PRIMER, CEERS and FRESCO, that all galaxies in our sample of
Ly-$\alpha$ emitters deep in the epoch of reionisation have close companions.
To understand the physical processes that lead to the observed Ly-$\alpha$
emission in our sample, we take advantage of novel on-the-fly radiative
transfer magnetohydrodynamical simulations with cosmic ray feedback. We find
that in the early Universe, the rapid build up of mass through frequent
galactic mergers leads to very bursty star formation which in turn drives
episodes of high intrinsic Ly-$\alpha$ emission and facilitates the escape of
Ly-$\alpha$ photons along channels cleared of neutral gas. These merging
galaxies reside in clustered environments thus creating sufficiently large
ionised bubbles. This presents a solution to the long-standing puzzle of the
detection of Ly-$\alpha$ emission deep into the epoch of reionisation.

to be driven by the continuous accretion of matter from the large-scale
filamentary surroundings and dramatic merger events with other clusters or

been limited only to mature clusters in the latter three-quarters of the
history of the Universe, and we have been lacking a direct view of the hot,

Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect in the direction of a protocluster. In fact, the
SZ signal reveals the ICM thermal energy in a way that is insensitive to
cosmological dimming, making it ideal for tracing the thermal history of cosmic
structures. This result indicates the presence of a nascent ICM within the
Spiderweb protocluster at redshift $z=2.156$, around 10 billion years ago. The
amplitude and morphology of the detected signal show that the SZ effect from

comparable with that of lower-redshift group-scale systems, consistent with
expectations for a dynamically active progenitor of a local galaxy cluster.

those measured or inferred for the Galaxy and Andromeda. With one set of
physical ingredients, TNG50 returns a large variety of flaring flavours and
amounts, also for mono-age stellar populations. With this paper, we hence
propose a non-parametric characterization of flaring. The typical MW/M31
analogs exhibit disk scaleheights that are $1.5-2$ times larger in the outer
than in the inner regions of the disk for both old and young stellar
populations, but with a large galaxy-to-galaxy variation. Which stellar
population flares more, and by how much, also varies from galaxy to galaxy.
TNG50 de facto brackets existing observational constraints for the Galaxy and
all previous numerical findings. A link between the amount of flaring and the

However, a connection between the scaleheights and the local stellar vertical
kinematics and gravitational potential is clearly in place.

According to experimental studies, the building blocks of life are most likely
produced photochemically in presence of a minimum ultraviolet (UV) flux. On the
other hand, high UV flux can be life-threatening, leading to atmospheric
erosion and damaging biomolecules essential to life. These arguments raise
questions about the actual habitability of CHZ planets around stars other than
Solar-type ones, with different UV to bolometric luminosity ratios. By
combining the ""principle of mediocricy"" and recent experimental studies, we
define UV boundary conditions (UV-habitable Zone, UHZ) within which life can
possibly emerge and evolve. We investigate whether exoplanets discovered in
CHZs do indeed experience such conditions. By analysing Swift-UV/Optical
Telescope data, we measure the near ultraviolet (NUV) luminosities of 17 stars
harbouring 23 planets in their CHZ. We derive an empirical relation between NUV
luminosity and stellar effective temperature. We find that eighteen of the CHZ
exoplanets actually orbit outside the UHZ, i.e., the NUV luminosity of their
M-dwarf hosts is decisively too low to trigger abiogenesis - through
cyanosulfidic chemistry - on them. Only stars with effective temperature >3900
K illuminate their CHZ planets with enough NUV radiation to trigger
abiogenesis. Alternatively, colder stars would require a high-energy flaring

black hole, resulting in an elongated stream of gas that partly falls back to
pericenter. Due to apsidal precession, the returning stream may collide with
itself, leading to a self-crossing shock that launches an outflow. If the black
hole spins, this collision may additionally be affected by Lense-Thirring
precession that can cause an offset between the two stream components. We study
the impact of this effect on the outflow properties by carrying out local
simulations of collisions between offset streams. As the offset increases, we
find that the geometry of the outflow becomes less spherical and more
collimated along the directions of the incoming streams, with less gas getting
unbound by the interaction. However, even the most grazing collisions we
consider significantly affect the trajectories of the colliding gas, likely
promoting subsequent strong interactions near the black hole and rapid disc
formation. We analytically compute the dependence of the offset to stream width
ratio, finding that even slowly spinning black holes can cause both strong and
grazing collisions. We propose that the deviation from outflow sphericity may
enhance the self-crossing shock luminosity due to a reduction of adiabatic
losses, and cause significant variations of the efficiency at which X-ray
radiation from the disc is reprocessed to the optical band depending on the

exhibit a remarkably regular alternating ""long-short'' pattern of recurrence
times between consecutive flares. We show that a main-sequence star (brought
into the nucleus as an extreme mass-ratio inspiral; EMRI) which passes twice
per orbit through the accretion disk of the supermassive black-hole (SMBH) on a
mildly eccentric inclined orbit, each time shocking and ejecting
optically-thick gas clouds above and below the midplane, naturally reproduces
observed properties of QPE flares. Inefficient photon production in the ejecta
renders the QPE emission much harder than the blackbody temperature, enabling
the flares to stick out from the softer quiescent disk spectrum. Destruction of
the star via mass ablation limits the QPE lifetime to decades, precluding a
long-lived AGN as the gaseous disk. By contrast, a tidal disruption event (TDE)
naturally provides a transient gaseous disk on the requisite radial scale, with
a rate exceeding the EMRI inward migration rate, suggesting that many TDEs
should host a QPE. This picture is consistent with the X-ray TDE observed
several years prior to the QPE appearance from GSN 069. Remarkably, a second
TDE-like flare was observed from this event, starting immediately after
detectable QPE activity ceased; this event could plausibly result from the

of galaxies with their circular velocities, has been validated across a wide
range of galaxies, from dwarf galaxies to massive galaxies. Recent studies have
found that several ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) deviate significantly from the
BTFR, indicating a galaxy population with abnormal dynamical properties.
However, such studies were still confined within a small sample size. In this
study, we used the 100% complete Arecibo Legacy Fast Arecibo L-band Feed Array
(ALFALFA) to investigate the BTFR of 88 HI-rich UDGs (HUDGs), which is the
largest UDG sample with dynamical information. We found that the HUDGs form a
continuous distribution in the BTFR diagram, with high-velocity galaxies
consistent with normal dwarf galaxies at 1 $\sigma$ level, and low-velocity
galaxies deviating from the BTFR, in line with that reported in the literature.
We point out that the observed deviation may be subject to various selection
effects or systemic biases. Nevertheless, we found that the significance of the
deviation of HUDGs from the BTFR and TFR are different, i.e., they either
deviate from the BTFR or from the TFR. Our result indicates that a high-gas
fraction may play an important role in explaining the deviation of HUDGs from
BTFR.

chemical accuracy and sensitivity with sub-nanometer spatial resolution.
Recently, there is an increasing interest in the application of APT to complex

to the field of metallurgy, where APT is routinely applied to study materials
at the atomic level, complex oxides and their specific field evaporation
mechanisms are much less explored. Here, we perform APT measurements on the
hexagonal manganite ErMnO3 and systematically study the effect of different
experimental parameters on the measured composition and atomic structure. We
demonstrate that both the mass resolving power (MRP) and compositional accuracy
can be improved by increasing the charge-state ratio (CSR) working at low laser
energy (< 5 pJ). Furthermore, we observe a substantial preferential retention
of Er atoms, which is suppressed at higher CSRs. We explain our findings based
on fundamental field evaporation concepts, expanding the knowledge about the
impact of key experimental parameters and the field evaporation process in
complex oxides in general.

observed magnitudes $<i>\sim28.2$ mag, $<H>\sim27.9$ mag), blue (UV-slope

populating the low-mass tail of our sample would qualify as starburst galaxies.

applications, particularly those where manually annotating data is cumbersome.
One such situation is the semantic segmentation of point clouds. In this

positive pairs by performing various augmentation of point clusters in a single

In this paper, we introduce an SSL strategy that leverages positive pairs in
both the spatial and temporal domain. To this end, we design (i) a
point-to-cluster learning strategy that aggregates spatial information to
distinguish objects; and (ii) a cluster-to-cluster learning strategy based on
unsupervised object tracking that exploits temporal correspondences. We
demonstrate the benefits of our approach via extensive experiments performed by
self-supervised training on two large-scale LiDAR datasets and transferring the

nonconvex optimization introduced by Polyak in 1964, and establish its
convergence under a variety of situations. Traditionally, most algorthms use
""full-coordinate update,"" that is, at each step, very component of the argument
is updated. However, when the dimension of the argument is very high, it is
more efficient to update some but not all components of the argument at each
iteration. We refer to this as ""batch updating"" in this paper.
  When gradient-based algorithms are used together with batch updating, in
principle it is sufficient to compute only those components of the gradient for
which the argument is to be updated. However, if a method such as back
propagation is used to compute these components, computing only some components
of gradient does not offer much savings over computing the entire gradient.
Therefore, to achieve a noticeable reduction in CPU usage at each step, one can
use first-order differences to approximate the gradient. The resulting
estimates are biased, and also have unbounded variance. Thus some delicate
analysis is required to ensure that the HB algorithm converge when batch
updating is used instead of full-coordinate updating, and/or approximate
gradients are used instead of true gradients. In this paper, we not only
establish the almost sure convergence of the iterations to the stationary
point(s) of the objective function, but also derive upper bounds on the rate of
convergence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other paper that
combines all of these features.

  Arbitrary-Scale Super Resolution",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MIASSR) has recently gained
widespread attention, aiming to super sample medical volumes at arbitrary
scales via a single model. However, existing MIASSR methods face two major
limitations: (i) reliance on high-resolution (HR) volumes and (ii) limited
generalization ability, which restricts their application in various scenarios.
To overcome these limitations, we propose Cube-based Neural Radiance Field
(CuNeRF), a zero-shot MIASSR framework that can yield medical images at
arbitrary scales and viewpoints in a continuous domain. Unlike existing MIASSR
methods that fit the mapping between low-resolution (LR) and HR volumes, CuNeRF
focuses on building a coordinate-intensity continuous representation from LR
volumes without the need for HR references. This is achieved by the proposed
differentiable modules: including cube-based sampling, isotropic volume
rendering, and cube-based hierarchical rendering. Through extensive experiments
on magnetic resource imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we
demonstrate that CuNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art MIASSR methods. CuNeRF
yields better visual verisimilitude and reduces aliasing artifacts at various
upsampling factors. Moreover, our CuNeRF does not need any LR-HR training
pairs, which is more flexible and easier to be used than others. Our code will
be publicly available soon.

facilitating intuitive and expressive natural language interactions.
State-of-the-art approaches in task-oriented dialog systems formulate the
problem as a conditional sequence generation task and fine-tune pre-trained
causal language models in the supervised setting. This requires labeled
training data for each new domain or task, and acquiring such data is
prohibitively laborious and expensive, thus making it a bottleneck for scaling
systems to a wide range of domains. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a
novel Zero-Shot generalizable end-to-end Task-oriented Dialog system, ZS-ToD,
that leverages domain schemas to allow for robust generalization to unseen
domains and exploits effective summarization of the dialog history. We employ
GPT-2 as a backbone model and introduce a two-step training process where the
goal of the first step is to learn the general structure of the dialog data and
the second step optimizes the response generation as well as intermediate
outputs, such as dialog state and system actions. As opposed to
state-of-the-art systems that are trained to fulfill certain intents in the
given domains and memorize task-specific conversational patterns, ZS-ToD learns
generic task-completion skills by comprehending domain semantics via domain
schemas and generalizing to unseen domains seamlessly. We conduct an extensive
experimental evaluation on SGD and SGD-X datasets that span up to 20 unique
domains and ZS-ToD outperforms state-of-the-art systems on key metrics, with an
improvement of +17% on joint goal accuracy and +5 on inform. Additionally, we
present a detailed ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed components and training mechanism

other biomolecules using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is essential for
understanding fundamental processes of life. However, it is still challenging
to reconstruct the continuous motions of 3D structures from hundreds of
thousands of noisy and randomly oriented 2D cryo-EM images. Existing methods
based on coordinate-based neural networks show compelling results to model
continuous conformations of 3D structures in the Fourier domain, but they
suffer from a limited ability to model local flexible regions and lack
interpretability. We propose a novel approach, cryoFormer, that utilizes a
transformer-based network architecture for continuous heterogeneous cryo-EM
reconstruction. We for the first time directly reconstruct continuous
conformations of 3D structures using an implicit feature volume in the 3D
spatial domain. A novel deformation transformer decoder further improves
reconstruction quality and, more importantly, locates and robustly tackles
flexible 3D regions caused by conformations. In experiments, our method
outperforms current approaches on three public datasets (1 synthetic and 2
experimental) and a new synthetic dataset of PEDV spike protein. The code and
new synthetic dataset will be released for better reproducibility of our

dynamically tunable adhesion with high-resolution spatial programmability
without alteration of bulk mechanics and chemistry. Further, the association of
linkages enables stable and tunable adhesion kinetics that can be tailored to

dichroism in strong electromagnetic fields. According to quantum
electrodynamics, the vacuum state exhibits different refractive properties
depending on the probe photon polarization and one also obtains different
probabilities of the photon decay via production of electron-positron pairs.
Here we investigate these two phenomena by means of several different
approaches to computing the polarization operator. The external field is
assumed to be a linearly polarized plane electromagnetic wave of arbitrary
amplitude and frequency. Varying the probe-photon energy and the field
parameters, we thoroughly examine the validity of the locally-constant field
approximation (LCFA) and techniques involving perturbative expansions in terms
of the external-field amplitude. Within the latter approach, we develop a
numerical method based on a direct evaluation of the weak-field Feynman
diagrams, which can be employed for investigating more complex external
backgrounds. It is demonstrated that the polarization operator depends on two
parameters: classical nonlinearity parameter $\xi$ and the product $\eta =
\omega q_0 / m^2$ of the laser field frequency $\omega$ and the photon energy
$q_0$ ($m$ is the electron mass). The domains of validity of the approximate
techniques in the $\xi \eta$ plane are explicitly identified.

numerous analytical as well as computational-based approaches developed to
extend the margins of wind farm efficiency and maximise power production. In
this work, we present the novel ML framework WakeNet, which can reproduce
generalised 2D turbine wake velocity fields at hub-height over a wide range of
yaw angles, wind speeds and turbulence intensities (TIs), with a mean accuracy
of 99.8% compared to the solution calculated using the state-of-the-art wind
farm modelling software FLORIS. As the generation of sufficient high-fidelity
data for network training purposes can be cost-prohibitive, the utility of
multi-fidelity transfer learning has also been investigated. Specifically, a
network pre-trained on the low-fidelity Gaussian wake model is fine-tuned in
order to obtain accurate wake results for the mid-fidelity Curl wake model. The
robustness and overall performance of WakeNet on various wake steering control
and layout optimisation scenarios has been validated through power-gain
heatmaps, obtaining at least 90% of the power gained through optimisation
performed with FLORIS directly. We also demonstrate that when utilising the
Curl model, WakeNet is able to provide similar power gains to FLORIS, two
orders of magnitude faster (e.g. 10 minutes vs 36 hours per optimisation case).
The wake evaluation time of wakeNet when trained on a high-fidelity CFD dataset
is expected to be similar, thus further increasing computational time gains.
These promising results show that generalised wake modelling with ML tools can
be accurate enough to contribute towards active yaw and layout optimisation,
while producing realistic optimised configurations at a fraction of the
computational cost, hence making it feasible to perform real-time active yaw
control as well as robust optimisation under uncertainty.

proposed as an inexpensive security service to enable a verifier (Vrf) to
remotely detect illegal modifications to a software binary installed on a
low-end prover MCU (Prv). Since attacks that hijack the software's control flow
can evade RA, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) augments RA with information about
the exact order in which instructions in the binary are executed, enabling
detection of control flow attacks. We observe that current CFA architectures
can not guarantee that Vrf ever receives control flow reports in case of
attacks. In turn, while they support exploit detection, they provide no means
to pinpoint the exploit origin. Furthermore, existing CFA requires either
binary instrumentation, incurring significant runtime overhead and code size
increase, or relatively expensive hardware support, such as hash engines. In
addition, current techniques are neither continuous (only meant to attest
self-contained operations) nor active (offer no secure means to remotely
remediate detected compromises). To jointly address these challenges, we
propose ACFA: a hybrid (hardware/software) architecture for Active CFA. ACFA
enables continuous monitoring of all control flow transfers in the MCU and does

concept of Active Roots-of-Trust to enable secure auditing of vulnerability

of a discrete-time autoregressive Markov process that is driven by white
Gaussian noise. A sensor observes this process, and then decides to either
encode the current state of this process into a data packet and attempts to
transmit it to the estimator over an unreliable wireless channel modeled as a
Gilbert-Elliott channel, or does not send any update. Each transmission attempt
consumes $\lambda$ units of transmission power, and the remote estimator is
assumed to be linear. The channel state is revealed only via the feedback
(ACK\slash NACK) of a transmission, and hence the channel state is not revealed
if no transmission occurs. The goal of the scheduler is to minimize the
expected value of an infinite-horizon cumulative discounted cost, in which the
instantaneous cost is composed of the following two quantities: (i)~squared
estimation error, (ii) transmission power. We show that this problem can
equivalently be posed as a partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP), in which the scheduler maintains a belief about the current state of
the channel, and makes decisions on the basis of the current value of the
estimation error, and the belief state.~We then show that the optimal policy is
of threshold-type, i.e. for each value of the estimation error $e$, there is a
threshold $b\ust(e)$ such that when the error is equal to $e$, then it is
optimal to transmit only when the current belief state is greater than
$b\ust(e)$.

approximation. These two relaxations, of allowing approximation and
randomization, seem necessary -- for many streaming problems, both relaxations
must be employed simultaneously, to avoid an exponentially larger (and often
trivial) space complexity. A common drawback of these randomized approximate
algorithms is that independent executions on the same input have different
outputs, that depend on their random coins. Pseudo-deterministic algorithms
combat this issue, and for every input, they output with high probability the
same ``canonical'' solution.
  We consider perhaps the most basic problem in data streams, of counting the
number of items in a stream of length at most $n$. Morris's counter [CACM,
1978] is a randomized approximation algorithm for this problem that uses
$O(\log\log n)$ bits of space, for every fixed approximation factor (greater
than $1$). Goldwasser, Grossman, Mohanty and Woodruff [ITCS 2020] asked whether
pseudo-deterministic approximation algorithms can match this space complexity.
Our main result answers their question negatively, and shows that such
algorithms must use $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n / \log\log n})$ bits of space.
  Our approach is based on a problem that we call Shift Finding, and may be of
independent interest. In this problem, one has query access to a shifted
version of a known string $F\in\{0,1\}^{3n}$, which is guaranteed to start with
$n$ zeros and end with $n$ ones, and the goal is to find the unknown shift
using a small number of queries. We provide for this problem an algorithm that
uses $O(\sqrt{n})$ queries. It remains open whether $poly(\log n)$ queries
suffice; if true, then our techniques immediately imply a nearly-tight

key results: (a) the bi-partiteness of the lattice affects the doping

Their spectra are shaped predominantly by gaseous water, methane, and ammonia.
At the warmer end of the Y dwarf temperature range, spectral signatures of
disequilibrium carbon monoxide have been observed. Cooler Y dwarfs could host
water clouds in their atmospheres. Since they make up the low-mass tail of the
star formation process, and are a valuable analogue to the atmospheres of giant
gaseous exoplanets in a temperature range that is difficult to observe,
understanding Y dwarf atmospheric compositions and processes will both deepen
our understanding of planet and star formation, and provide a stepping stone
towards characterizing cool exoplanets. JWST spectral observations are
anticipated to provide an unprecedented level of detail for these objects, and
yet published self-consistent model grids do not accurately replicate even the

The problem is reduced to a variational inequality involving a nonlinear

fall into the class of the so-called Leray-Lions operators, so that a result of
Br\'ezis can be invoked to solve the variational inequality. It turns out that

spanner for disks (or more generally objects with linear union complexity) in

to as substitutional alloys, canonical average acts as nonlinear map F from a

statistical manifold, at any given configuration, F can be divided into the sum
of local and non-local contribution in terms of Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence, where the former has strong positive correlation with time
evolution of the nonlinearity (NOL) on configuration space (called
anharmonicity in structural degree of freedoms (ASDF), while the latter,
corresponding to entanglement in SDFs, does exhibit clear correlation with the
ASDF. On the other hand, our recent work bridge the different concepts of NOL
on configuration space and statistical manifold through stochastic
thermodynamics. While the work successfully provides clear relationships
between the changes in total NOL through system transition and heat transfer,
thermodynamic interpretation of how the entanglment in SDFs contributes to
thermodynamic functions, is totally unclear due mainly to its non-trivial,
non-local character. The present study tackle this problem, deriving upper
bound for the entanglement for any given transition in terms of the mutual

obstacle relates to the inherent complexity of the space of operators between
infinite-dimensional input and output spaces, resulting in a rigorous and

homogeneous systems is given by the topological invariant composed of the Green
function depending on momentum of quasiparticle. This expression reveals
correspondence with the mathematical notion of the degree of mapping. A more
involved situation takes place for the quantum Hall effect in the presence of
external magnetic field. In this case the mentioned expression remains valid if
the Green function is taken in a specific representation, where it becomes the
infinite - dimensional matrix \cite{Imai:1990zz} or if it is replaced by its
Wigner transformation while ordinary products are replaced by the Moyal
products \cite{ZW2019}. Both these expressions, unfortunately, are much more
complicated and might be useless for the practical calculations. Here we
represent the alternative representation for the Hall conductivity of a uniform
system in the presence of constant magnetic field. The Hall conductivity is
expressed through the Green function taken in Harper representation, when its
nonhomogeneity is attributed to the matrix structure while functional
dependence is on one momentum that belongs to magnetic Brillouin zone. Our
consideration for the interacting systems is non - perturbative and is based on
the Schwinger - Dyson equations truncated in a reasonable way. We demonstrate
that in this approximation the expression for the Hall conductivity in Harper
representation remains valid, where the interacting Green function is to be
used instead of the non - interacting one. We, therefore, propose that the
obtained expression may be used for the topological description of fractional
quantum Hall effect.

engineering protocols where a sequence of generalized measurements is employed
to steer a quantum system toward a desired target state. Previously studied
measurement-based protocols relied on idealized procedures and avoided
exploration of the effects of various errors stemming from imperfections of
experimental realizations and external noise. We employ the quantum trajectory
formalism to provide a detailed analysis of the robustness of these steering
protocols against various errors. We study a set of errors that can be
classified as dynamic or static, depending on whether they remain unchanged
while running the protocol. More specifically, we investigate the impact of
erroneous choice of system-detector coupling, re-initialization of the detector
state following a measurement step, fluctuating steering directions, and
environmentally induced errors in the system-detector interaction. We show that
the protocol remains fully robust against the erroneous choice of
system-detector coupling parameters and presents reasonable robustness against
other errors. We employ various quantifiers such as fidelity, trace distance,
and linear entropy to characterize the protocol's robustness and provide
analytical results. Subsequently, we demonstrate the commutation between the

of the disk. We developed a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework to constrain
the geometric properties of each dust disk. In three systems, the dust disk and
the gas disk appear to coincide spatially. For the two brown dwarf white dwarf

dwarfs. The origin of the infrared excess around Gaia J0723+6301 remains a

determine sources of infrared excess around white dwarfs, which has now been
detected in hundreds of systems photometrically.

the stability domains of modules for the preprojective algebra in the

self-extensions. We define ""shard modules"" to be those real bricks whose
stability domain is as large as possible (meaning, of dimension one less than
the rank of the preprojective algebra). We show that all real bricks are
obtained by applying the Baumann-Kamnitzer reflection functors to simple
modules, and we give a recursive formula for the stability domain of a real
brick. We show that shard modules are in bijection with Nathan Reading's
""shards"", and that their stability domains are the shards; we also establish
many foundational results about shards in infinite type which have not
previously appeared in print. With an eye toward applications to cluster

skew-symmetric exchange matrices, and we therefore discuss the basics of the

Euler-Lagrange simulations where particles having friction Stokes number
$\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$ or 30 are introduced at progressively increasing mass
loading from $M=0.2$ to 1.0. The simulations show that $\mathrm{St}^+ = 30$
particles cause large drag-reduction by up to 19.74\% at $M=1.0$, whereas
$\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$ particles cause large drag increase by up to 16.92\% at

we investigate the stress distribution within the channel and the impact of the
dispersed particles on the near-wall coherent structures. We find a distinctive
feature of drag-reducing particles which consists in the formation of extremely
long clusters, called ropes. These structures align preferentially with the
low-speed streaks and contribute to their stabilization and suppression of
bursting. Despite the additional stresses due to the particles, the modulation
of the near-wall coherent structures leads to a greater reduction of Reynolds
shear stresses and partial relaminarization of the near-wall flow. In the case
of the drag-increasing particles with $\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$, a reduction in
Reynolds shear stresses is also observed, however, this reduction is
insufficient to overcome the additional particle stresses which leads to drag
increase.

associated with the galactic plane. The sensitivity to primary mass is obtained
through the depth of shower maximum, $X_{\rm max}$, extracted from hybrid
events measured over a 14-year period at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The sky
is split into distinct on- and off-plane regions using the galactic latitude of
each arriving cosmic ray to form two distributions of $X_{\rm max}$, which are
compared using an Anderson-Darling 2-samples test. A scan over roughly half of
the data is used to select a lower threshold energy of $10^{18.7}\,$eV and a
galactic latitude splitting at $|b| = 30^\circ$, which are set as a
prescription for the remaining data. With these thresholds, the distribution of
$X_{\rm max}$ from the on-plane region is found to have a $9.1 \pm
1.6^{+2.1}_{-2.2}\,$g$\,$cm$^-2$ shallower mean and a
$5.9\pm2.1^{+3.5}_{-2.5}\,$g$\,$cm$^-2$ narrower width than that of the
off-plane region and is observed in all telescope sites independently. These
differences indicate that the mean mass of primary particles arriving from the
on-plane region is greater than that of those from the off-plane region. Monte
Carlo studies yield a $5.9\times10^{-6}$ random chance probability for the
result in the independent data, lowering to a $6.0\times10^{-7}$
post-penalization random chance probability when the scanned data is included.
Accounting for systematic uncertainties leads to an indication for anisotropy
in mass composition above $10^{18.7}\,$eV with a $3.3\,\sigma$ significance.
Furthermore, the result has been newly tested using additional FD data
recovered from the selection process. This test independently disfavors the on-

which is in good agreement with the expected sensitivity of the dataset used

effect on radio pulsar observations, through angular scattering, intensity
scintillations, and small changes in time delays from dispersion. Here we show
that it is possible to recover the variations in dispersive delays that
originate from a dominant scattering region using measurements of the dynamic
spectrum of intensity scintillations, provided that the pulsar velocity and
scattering region location are known. We provide a theoretical framework for
the technique, which involves estimating the phase gradient from the dynamic
spectra and integrating that gradient to obtain phase variations. It can be
used to search for ""extreme scattering events"" (ESEs) in pulsars for which
precision dispersion delay measurements are not otherwise possible, or to
separate true dispersion variations from apparent variability caused by
frequency-dependent pulse shape changes. We demonstrate that it works in
practice by recovering an ESE in PSR J1603$-$7202, which is known from
precision dispersion delay measurements from pulsar timing. For this pulsar, we
find that the phase gradients also track the long-term variations in electron
column density observed by pulsar timing, indicating that the column density
variations and the scattering are dominated by the same thin scattering screen.
We identify a sudden increase in the scintillation strength and magnitude of
phase gradients over $\sim$days in 2010, indicating a compact structure. A
decrease in the electron density in 2012 was associated with persistent phase
gradients and preceded a period of decreased scintillation strength and an
absence of scintillation arcs.

scattering of a dipole with size $r$ off the target that is probed at momentum
fraction $x_0$. Rather than using ad hoc parameterizations tuned to high-energy
data at $x\ll x_0$, here we attempt to construct an initial scattering
amplitude that is consistent with low-energy, large-$x$ properties of the
proton. We start from a non-perturbative three quark light-cone model wave
function from the literature. We add ${\cal O}(g)$ corrections due to the
emission of a gluon, and ${\cal O}(g^2)$ virtual corrections due to the
exchange of a gluon, computed in light-cone perturbation theory with exact
kinematics. We provide numerical data as well as analytic parameterizations of
the resulting $N(r; x_0)$ for $x_0=0.01 - 0.05$. Solving the BK equation in the
leading logarithmic (LL) approximation towards lower $x$, we obtain a fair
description of the charm cross section in deeply inelastic scattering measured
at HERA by fitting one parameter, the coupling constant $\alpha_s\simeq 0.2$.
However, without the option to tune the initial amplitude at $x_0$, the fit of
the high precision data results in $\chi^2/N_\text{dof} = 2.3$ at $N_\text{dof}
=38$, providing clear statistical evidence for the need of systematic
improvement e.g. of the photon wave function, evolution equation, and initial

leading to discrepancies between the local training dataset and long-term

rules - First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Static Ratio Selective Replacement (SRSR),
and Dynamic Ratio Selective Replacement (DRSR) - that update the local cache of
each client while considering the limited cache capacity. Furthermore, we
derive a convergence bound for our proposed SFL algorithm as a function of the
distribution discrepancy between the long-term data distribution and the
client's local training dataset. We then evaluate our proposed algorithm on two

grouping leverages cut-and-paste to manually create temporal scene changes and
then learns distinguishable features from different scenes. Comprehensive

stars with this abundance signature ``iron-rich metal-poor'' or IRMP stars. We
suggest that IRMP stars formed in environments dominated by thermonuclear

constrain both the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms responsible for
thermonuclear explosions. We identify three IRMP in the literature and
homogeneously infer their elemental abundances. We find that the elemental

new tasks for pop quizzes with the following features: (a) Adaptive (i.e.,
individualized to the student's current attempt), (b) Comprehensible (i.e.,
easy to comprehend and solve), and (c) Concealing (i.e., do not reveal the

symbolic reasoning and graph-based code representations. We show that our
algorithm can generate hundreds of pop quizzes for different student attempts
on reference tasks from Hour of Code: Maze Challenge and Karel. We assess the
quality of these pop quizzes through expert ratings using an evaluation rubric.
Further, we have built an online platform for practicing block-based

signaling networks, there is a non-trivial relationship between the micro-level
logic of component interactions and the observed macro-dynamics. Here we
address this issue by formalizing the existing concept of pathway modules,
which are sequences of state updates that are guaranteed to occur (barring
outside interference) in the dynamics of automata networks after the
perturbation of a subset of driver nodes. We present a novel algorithm to
automatically extract pathway modules from networks and we characterize the
interactions that may take place between modules. This methodology uses only
the causal logic of individual node variables (micro-dynamics) without the need
to compute the dynamical landscape of the networks (macro-dynamics).
Specifically, we identify complex modules, which maximize pathway length and
require synergy between their components. This allows us to propose a new take
on dynamical modularity that partitions complex networks into causal pathways
of variables that are guaranteed to transition to specific states given a
perturbation to a set of driver nodes. Thus, the same node variable can take
part in distinct modules depending on the state it takes. Our measure of
dynamical modularity of a network is then inversely proportional to the overlap
among complex modules and maximal when complex modules are completely
decouplable from one another in the network dynamics. We estimate dynamical
modularity for several genetic regulatory networks, including the Drosophila
melanogaster segment-polarity network. We discuss how identifying complex
modules and the dynamical modularity portrait of networks explains the
macro-dynamics of biological networks, such as uncovering the (more or less)
decouplable building blocks of emergent computation (or collective behavior) in
biochemical regulation and signaling.

a novel method for maximum likelihood (ML) smoothing estimation from incomplete
information/data of stochastic state-space systems. Score function and
conditional observed information matrices of incomplete data are introduced and
their distributional identities are established. Using these identities, the ML
smoother $\widehat{x}_{k\vert n}^s =\argmax_{x_k} \log
f(x_k,\widehat{x}_{k+1\vert n}^s, y_{0:n}\vert\theta)$, $k\leq n-1$, is
presented. The result shows that the ML smoother gives an estimate of state
$x_k$ with more adherence of loglikehood having less standard errors than that
of the ML state estimator $\widehat{x}_k=\argmax_{x_k} \log
f(x_k,y_{0:k}\vert\theta)$, with $\widehat{x}_{n\vert n}^s=\widehat{x}_n$.
Recursive estimation is given in terms of an EM-gradient-particle algorithm
which extends the work of \cite{Lange} for ML smoothing estimation. The
algorithm has an explicit iteration update which lacks in (\cite{Ramadan})
EM-algorithm for smoothing. A sequential Monte Carlo method is developed for
valuation of the score function and observed information matrices. A recursive
equation for the covariance matrix of estimation error is developed to
calculate the standard errors. In the case of linear systems, the method shows
that the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother is a fully efficient smoothing
state-estimator whose covariance matrix coincides with the Cram\'er-Rao lower
bound, the inverse of expected information matrix. Furthermore, the RTS
smoother coincides with the Kalman filter having less covariance matrix.
Numerical studies are performed, confirming the accuracy of the main results.

imperative, however, that the implications of data sharing be effectively
communicated to the data principal to ensure informed decision-making and offer
full transparency with regards to the associated privacy risks. To this end,
our work presents a rigorous quantitative evaluation of the protection
conferred by private learners by investigating their resilience to training
data reconstruction attacks. We accomplish this by deriving non-asymptotic
lower bounds on the reconstruction error incurred by any adversary against
$(\epsilon, \delta)$ differentially private learners for target samples that
belong to any compact metric space. Working with a generalization of
differential privacy, termed metric privacy, we remove boundedness assumptions
on the input space prevalent in prior work, and prove that our results hold for
general locally compact metric spaces. We extend the analysis to cover the high
dimensional regime, wherein, the input data dimensionality may be larger than
the adversary's query budget, and demonstrate that our bounds are minimax
optimal under certain regimes.

near-wall peak of the streamwise turbulence intensity has been developed (Chen
$\&$ Sreenivasan, J. Fluid Mech. (2021), vol.908, R3). Based on the finiteness
of the near-wall turbulence production, this model predicts that the magnitude
of the peak will approach a finite limit as the Reynolds number increases. In
the present study, we revisit the basic hypotheses of the model, such as the
balance between the turbulence production and the wall dissipation in the
region of peak production, the negligible effects of the logarithmic motions on
the wall dissipation, and the typical time-scale that the outer-layer flow
imposes on the inner layer. Our analyses show that some of them are not
consistent with the characteristics of the wall-bounded turbulence. Moreover,
based on the spectral stochastic estimation, we develop a framework to assess
the wall dissipation contributed by the energy-containing eddies populating the
logarithmic region, and uncover the linkage between its magnitude and the local
Reynolds number. Our results demonstrate that these multi-scale eddies make a
non-negligible contribution to the formation of the wall dissipation. Based on
these observations, we verify that the classical logarithmic model, which
suggests a logarithmic growth of the near-wall peak of the streamwise
turbulence intensity with regard to the friction Reynolds number, is more
physically consistent, and still holds even with the latest
high-Reynolds-number database.

DF2 and DF4 (the two dwarf galaxies with overluminous GC populations). Both
selection methods reveal overdensities around the massive galaxies in the

positions of previously identified stellar streams and tidal features. No
intragroup GCs are found connecting these structures to any of the dwarf

that the GC distribution in the group does not strongly support any formation

b-value dependence of the signal. Applications in tissue classification and
micro-architecture estimation, therefore, require a signal representation that
extends over the radial as well as angular domain. Multiple approaches have
been proposed that can model the non-linear relationship between the DW-MRI
signal and biological microstructure. In the past few years, many deep
learning-based methods have been developed towards faster inference speed and
higher inter-scan consistency compared with traditional model-based methods

a multi-stage learning strategy is typically required since the learning

Therefore, clarifying the effects of alloying elements on the GSFEs is of great
significance for alloys design. Here, by means of ab initio density functional
theory calculations, we systematically calculated the GSFEs of different slip
systems of Ni and Ni$_{3}$Al without and with alloying elements using the alias
shear method. We obtained that for Ni, except for magnetic elements Mn, Fe, and
Co, most of alloying elements decrease the unstable stacking fault energy

elements in groups VB-VIIB and the first column of group VIII increase the
values of $\gamma_{usf}$ of different slip systems of Ni$_{3}$Al. On the other

slip systems for Ni$_{3}$Al. W and Mo exhibit similar effects as Re. We

arbitrary geometry. The cost function is defined as the acoustic potential
energy, i.e., the regional integral of the power distribution inside the target
region. However, this cost function does not take into consideration the
exterior radiation of secondary sources. Thus, the acoustic power in the
exterior region can be amplified by the output of the secondary sources. We
propose two spatial ANC methods with exterior radiation suppression. The first
approach is based on the minimization of the cost function formulated as a sum
of the interior acoustic potential energy and exterior radiation power. The
second approach is based on the minimization of the interior acoustic potential
energy with inequality constraints on the exterior radiation power. Adaptive
algorithms for minimizing the cost function are derived for the two approaches.
Numerical experimental results indicate that the proposed methods can reduce

  Model and QCD","42 pages, 6 figures",,,"TU-1182, KEK-TH-2501","hep-ph hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is becoming more important to subtract renormalons efficiently from
perturbative calculations, in order to achieve high precision QCD calculations.
We propose a new framework ``Dual Space Approach"" for renormalon separation,
which enables subtraction of multiple renormalons simultaneously. Using a dual
transform which suppresses infrared renormalons, we derive a one-parameter
integral representation of a general observable. We investigate systematically
how renormalons emerge and get canceled in the entire operator product
expansion (OPE) of an observable, by applying the expansion-by-regions (EBR)
method to this one-parameter integral expression. In particular we investigate
in detail OPEs in a solvable model, the 2-dimensional $O(N)$ nonlinear $\sigma$
model, by the dual space approach. A nontrivial mechanism of renormalon
cancellation in this model can be understood from an integration identity on
which the EBR method is founded. We demonstrate that the dual space approach
can be useful by a simulation study imitating the QCD case. Application of this
method to QCD calculations is also discussed.

fatalities. Various transportation agencies have proposed speed management
strategies to reduce the amount of speeding on arterials. While there have been
various studies done on the analysis of speeding proportions above the speed
limit, few studies have considered the effect on the individual's journey. Many
studies utilized speed data from detectors, which is limited in that there is
no information of the route that the driver took. This study aims to explore
the effects of various roadway features an individual experiences for a given
journey on speeding proportions. Connected vehicle trajectory data was utilized
to identify the path that a driver took, along with the vehicle related
variables. The level of speeding proportion is predicted using multiple
learning models. The model with the best performance, Extreme Gradient
Boosting, achieved an accuracy of 0.756. The proposed model can be used to
understand how the environment and vehicle's path effects the drivers' speeding
behavior, as well as predict the areas with high levels of speeding
proportions. The results suggested that features related to an individual
driver's trip, i.e., total travel time, has a significant contribution towards
speeding. Features that are related to the environment of the individual
driver's trip, i.e., proportion of residential area, also had a significant
effect on reducing speeding proportions. It is expected that the findings could
help inform transportation agencies more on the factors related to speeding for

approaches to nonparametric or semi-parametric statistical inferences. The
overwhelmingly favoured maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under parametric
model is renowned for its strong consistency and optimality generally credited
to Cramer. These properties, however, falter when the model is not regular or
not completely accurate. In addition, their applicability is limited to local
maxima close to the unknown true parameter value. One must therefore ascertain
that the global maximum of the likelihood is strongly consistent under generic
conditions (Wald, 1949). Global consistency is also a vital research problem in
the context of empirical likelihood (Owen, 2001). The EL is a ground-breaking
platform for nonparametric statistical inference. A subsequent milestone is
achieved by placing estimating functions under the EL umbrella (Qin and
Lawless, 1994). The resulting profile EL function possesses many nice
properties of parametric likelihood but also shares the same shortcomings.
These properties cannot be utilized unless we know the local maximum at hand is
close to the unknown true parameter value. To overcome this obstacle, we first
put forward a clean set of conditions under which the global maximum is
consistent. We then develop a global maximum test to ascertain if the local
maximum at hand is in fact a global maximum. Furthermore, we invent a global
maximum remedy to ensure global consistency by expanding the set of estimating
functions under EL. Our simulation experiments on many examples from the
literature firmly establish that the proposed approaches work as predicted. Our
approaches also provide superior solutions to problems of their parametric
counterparts investigated by DeHaan (1981), Veall (1991), and Gan and Jiang

deep learning. The success of deep learning paradigm lies in three key
components: data, model, and loss. Currently, many efforts have been devoted to
the first two while seldom study focuses on loss function. With the question
``are the de facto optimization functions e.g., $L_1$, $L_2$, and perceptual
losses optimal?'', we explore the potential of loss and raise our belief
``learned loss function empowers the learning capability of neural networks for
image and video restoration''.
  Concretely, we stand on the shoulders of the masked Autoencoders (MAE) and
formulate it as a `learned loss function', owing to the fact the pre-trained
MAE innately inherits the prior of image reasoning. We investigate the efficacy
of our belief from three perspectives: 1) from task-customized MAE to native
MAE, 2) from image task to video task, and 3) from transformer structure to
convolution neural network structure. Extensive experiments across multiple
image and video tasks, including image denoising, image super-resolution, image
enhancement, guided image super-resolution, video denoising, and video
enhancement, demonstrate the consistent performance improvements introduced by
the learned loss function. Besides, the learned loss function is preferable as

$\epsilon >0$ be any constant. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the exponential hardness

length~$n$ cannot be decided by circuits of size smaller than $2^{\epsilon n}$.
We prove that for every function $f :\{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, computable
by a randomized logspace algorithm $R$, there exists a deterministic logspace
algorithm $D$ (attempting to compute $f$), such that on every input $x$ of
length $n$, the algorithm $D$ outputs one of the following:
  1: The correct value $f(x)$.
  2: The string: ``I am unable to compute $f(x)$ because the hardness
assumption $\mathcal{A}$ is false'', followed by a (provenly correct) circuit
of size smaller than $2^{\epsilon n'}$ for membership in $\mathcal{L}$ for

refutes $\mathcal{A}$.
  Our next result is a universal derandomizer for $BPL$: We give a
deterministic algorithm $U$ that takes as an input a randomized logspace
algorithm $R$ and an input $x$ and simulates the computation of $R$ on $x$,
deteriministically. Under the widely believed assumption $BPL=L$, the space
used by $U$ is at most $C_R \cdot \log n$ (where $C_R$ is a constant depending
on~$R$). Moreover, for every constant $c \geq 1$, if $BPL\subseteq
SPACE[(\log(n))^{c}]$ then the space used by $U$ is at most $C_R \cdot
(\log(n))^{c}$.
  Finally, we prove that if optimal hitting sets for ordered branching programs
exist then there is a deterministic logspace algorithm that, given a black-box
access to an ordered branching program $B$ of size $n$, estimates the
probability that $B$ accepts on a uniformly random input. This extends the

cancers; 7,594 women; age 57.1 \pm 11.0) and 1,880 UK exams (590 cancers; 1,745
women; age 63.3 \pm 7.2). A model trained on images of only view markers (no

achieved a 0.945 AUC on the combined US+UK dataset but paradoxically only 0.838

from both datasets during training mitigated this shortcut. A similar AUC
paradox (0.903) occurred when evaluating diagnostic exams vs screening exams
(0.862 vs 0.861, respectively). Removing diagnostic exams during training
alleviated this bias. Finally, the model did not exhibit the AUC paradox over
scanner models but still exhibited a bias toward Selenia Dimension (SD) over
Hologic Selenia (HS) exams. Analysis showed that this AUC paradox occurred when
a dataset attribute had values with a higher cancer prevalence (dataset bias)
and the model consequently assigned a higher probability to these attribute
values (model bias). Stratification and balancing cancer prevalence can
mitigate shortcuts during evaluation.
  Dataset and model bias can introduce shortcuts and the AUC paradox,
potentially pervasive issues within the healthcare AI space. Our methods can

ambiguity set is defined by a linear system of inequalities represented by the
Lebesgue-Stieltjes (LS) integrals of the DM's utility functions. To solve the

scheme to approximate the DM's true unknown utility so that the inner

binary variables to locate the position of the reward function in a family of

that such designs can be effectively automated and accelerated via tools from

fundamental challenge, however, is that it is prohibitively complex, if not
impossible, to design and train fully ML-driven encoder and decoder pairs for

problem of training the encoder and decoder for a large code dimension $k$ and
blocklength $n$ to less-complex sub-problems of training encoders and decoders
for smaller dimensions and blocklengths. Our training results show successful
training of ProductAEs of dimensions as large as $k = 300$ bits with meaningful

edit arbitrary denoising levels in real-time with only one-time network
inference. Unlike existing controllable denoising methods that require multiple
denoisers and training stages, RCD replaces the last output layer (which
usually outputs a single noise map) of an existing CNN-based model with a
lightweight module that outputs multiple noise maps. We propose a novel Noise

allowing arbitrary noise level control through noise map interpolation. This

heteronuclear architecture of parallel implementation of CNOT gates in arrays
of alkali-metal neutral atoms for quantum information processing. We considered
a scheme where we perform CNOT gates in a parallel manner within the array,
while they are performed sequentially between the pairs of neighboring qubits
by coherently transporting an array of atoms of one atomic species (ancilla
qubits) using an array of mobile optical dipole traps generated by a 2D
acousto-optic deflector (AOD). The atoms of the second atomic species (data
qubits) are kept in the array of static optical dipole traps generated by
spatial light modulator (SLM). The moving ancillas remain in the superposition
of their logical ground states without loss of coherence, while their
transportation paths avoid overlaps with the spatial positions of data atoms.
We numerically optimized the system parameters to achieve the fidelity for
parallelly implemented CNOT gates around $\mathcal{F}=95\%$ for the
experimentally feasible conditions. Our design can be useful for implementation
of surface codes for quantum error correction. Renyi entropy and mutual
information are also investigated to characterize the gate performance.

Motivated by the frequent absence of first-order information such as partial

one hand, advanced foundation models like ChatGPT can offer powerful
conversation, in-context learning and code generation abilities on a broad
range of open-domain tasks. They can also generate high-level solution outlines
for domain-specific tasks based on the common sense knowledge they have
acquired. However, they still face difficulties with some specialized tasks
because they lack enough domain-specific data during pre-training or they often
have errors in their neural network computations on those tasks that need
accurate executions. On the other hand, there are also many existing models and
systems (symbolic-based or neural-based) that can do some domain-specific tasks
very well. However, due to the different implementation or working mechanisms,
they are not easily accessible or compatible with foundation models. Therefore,
there is a clear and pressing need for a mechanism that can leverage foundation
models to propose task solution outlines and then automatically match some of
the sub-tasks in the outlines to the off-the-shelf models and systems with
special functionalities to complete them. Inspired by this, we introduce
TaskMatrix.AI as a new AI ecosystem that connects foundation models with
millions of APIs for task completion. Unlike most previous work that aimed to
improve a single AI model, TaskMatrix.AI focuses more on using existing
foundation models (as a brain-like central system) and APIs of other AI models
and systems (as sub-task solvers) to achieve diversified tasks in both digital
and physical domains. As a position paper, we will present our vision of how to
build such an ecosystem, explain each key component, and use study cases to

environment perception, and semantic scene segmentation (3S) has received a
great deal of attention due to the richness of the semantic information it
contains. It aims to assign labels to pixels in an image, thus enabling
automatic image labeling. Current approaches are mainly based on convolutional
neural networks (CNN), but they rely on a large number of labels. Therefore,
how to use a small size of labeled data to achieve semantic segmentation
becomes more and more important. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation
(DA) framework based on optimal transport (OT) and attention mechanism to
address this issue. Concretely, first we generate the output space via CNN due
to its superiority of feature representation. Second, we utilize OT to achieve
a more robust alignment of source and target domains in output space, where the
OT plan defines a well attention mechanism to improve the adaptation of the
model. In particular, with OT, the number of network parameters has been
reduced and the network has been better interpretable. Third, to better
describe the multi-scale property of features, we construct a multi-scale
segmentation network to perform domain adaptation. Finally, in order to verify
the performance of our proposed method, we conduct experimental comparison with
three benchmark and four SOTA methods on three scene datasets, and the mean
intersection-over-union (mIOU) has been significant improved, and visualization
results under multiple domain adaptation scenarios also show that our proposed
method has better performance than compared semantic segmentation methods.

for simultaneous multi-slab diffusion MRI acquired with blipped-CAIPI gradients
(blipped-SMSlab), which can also incorporate distortion correction.
  Methods: We formulate blipped-SMSlab in a 4D k-space with kz gradients for
the intra-slab slice encoding and km (blipped-CAIPI) gradients for the
inter-slab encoding. Because kz and km gradients share the same physical axis,
the blipped-CAIPI gradients introduce phase interference in the z-km domain
while motion induces phase variations in the kz-m domain. Thus, our previous
k-space-based reconstruction would need multiple steps to transform data back
and forth between k-space and image space for phase correction. Here we propose
a model-based hybrid-space reconstruction algorithm to correct the phase errors
simultaneously. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is combined with distortion
correction, and jointly reconstructs data acquired with the blip-up/down
acquisition to reduce the g-factor penalty.
  Results: The blipped-CAIPI-induced phase interference is corrected by the
hybrid-space reconstruction. Blipped-CAIPI can reduce the g-factor penalty
compared to the non-blipped acquisition in the basic reconstruction.
Additionally, the joint reconstruction simultaneously corrects the image
distortions and improves the 1/g-factors by around 50%. Furthermore, through
the joint reconstruction, SMSlab acquisitions without the blipped-CAIPI
gradients also show comparable correction performance with blipped-SMSlab.
  Conclusion: The proposed model-based hybrid-space reconstruction can
reconstruct blipped-SMSlab diffusion MRI successfully. Its extension to a joint
reconstruction of the blip-up/down acquisition can correct EPI distortions and
further reduce the g-factor penalty compared with the separate reconstruction.

neuroimaging data is increasingly being combined with other non-imaging
modalities, such as behavioral and genetic data. The data structure of many of
these modalities can be expressed as time-varying multidimensional arrays
(tensors), collected at different time-points on multiple subjects. Here, we
consider a new approach for the study of neural correlates in the presence of
tensor-valued brain images and tensor-valued predictors, where both data types
are collected over the same set of time points. We propose a time-varying
tensor regression model with an inherent structural composition of responses
and covariates. Regression coefficients are expressed using the B-spline
technique, and the basis function coefficients are estimated using
CP-decomposition by minimizing a penalized loss function. We develop a
varying-coefficient model for the tensor-valued regression model, where both
predictors and responses are modeled as tensors. This development is a
non-trivial extension of function-on-function concurrent linear models for
complex and large structural data where the inherent structures are preserved.
In addition to the methodological and theoretical development, the efficacy of
the proposed method based on both simulated and real data analysis (e.g., the
combination of eye-tracking data and functional magnetic resonance imaging

auxiliary boundary conditions or continuity constraints. Such a representation
(termed a Partial Integral Equation or PIE) is then defined in terms of an

dynamics of the associated fundamental state are no longer parameterized in

further show that this tensor product of the fundamental state forms a natural

this architecture consists of local self-attention and self-positioning

self-positioning points, we propose a novel global cross-attention mechanism

Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques are out-of-equilibrium states that slowly

the quantum discord dynamics as a witness of the quantum correlation in this

initial state is prepared with the NMR Jeener-Broekaert pulse sequence,
starting from equilibrium at high temperature and high external magnetic field.
It then evolves as an open quantum system within two different dynamic
scenarios: adiabatic decoherence driven by the coupling of the pairs to a
common phonon field, described within a non-markovian approach; and
spin-lattice relaxation represented by a markovian master equation, and driven
by thermal fluctuations. In this way, the studied model is endowed with the
dynamics of a realistic solid sample. The quantum discord rapidly increases
during the preparation of the initial state, escalating several orders of
magnitude compared with thermal equilibrium at room temperature. Despite the
vanishing of coherences during decoherence, the quantum discord oscillates
around this high value and undergoes a minor attenuation, holding the same
order of magnitude as the initial state. Finally, the quantum discord

protein sequences, have been a promising tool for protein sequence design. In
real-world protein engineering, there are many cases where the amino acids in
the middle of a protein sequence are optimized while maintaining other
residues. Unfortunately, because of the left-to-right nature of pLMs, existing
pLMs modify suffix residues by prompting prefix residues, which are
insufficient for the infilling task that considers the whole surrounding
context. To find the more effective pLMs for protein engineering, we design a
new benchmark, Secondary structureE InFilling rEcoveRy, SEIFER, which
approximates infilling sequence design scenarios. With the evaluation of
existing models on the benchmark, we reveal the weakness of existing language
models and show that language models trained via fill-in-middle transformation,
called ProtFIM, are more appropriate for protein engineering. Also, we prove
that ProtFIM generates protein sequences with decent protein representations

(CFIs) potentially affect the dynamics of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and
binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Under the assumption of homogeneous
neutrinos, we investigate effects of neutrino emission and absorption (EA) by
matters through both single and multi-energy numerical simulations with
physically motivated setup. In our models, FFCs dominate over CFIs in the early
phase, while EA secularly and significantly give impacts on flavor conversions.
They facilitate angular swaps, or the full exchange between electron neutrinos
($\nu_e$) and heavy-leptonic neutrinos ($\nu_x$). As a result, the number
density of $\nu_x$ becomes more abundant than the case without EA, despite the
fact that the isotropization by EA terminates the FFCs earlier. In the later
phase, the system approaches new asymptotic states characterized by EA and
CFIs, in which rich energy-dependent structures also emerge. Multi-energy
effects sustain FFCs and the time evolution of the flavor conversion becomes
energy dependent, which are essentially in line with effects of the
isoenergetic scattering studied in our previous paper. We also find that
$\nu_x$ in the high-energy region convert into $\nu_e$ via flavor conversions
and then they are absorbed through charged current reactions, exhibiting the
possibility of new path of heating matters.

field of one-bit signal processing and has numerous practical applications.
Despite its importance, the conventional arcsine law with zero threshold is
incapable of recovering the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix. To
address this limitation, recent studies have proposed the use of non-zero
clipping thresholds. However, the relationship between the estimation error and
the sampling threshold is not yet known. In this paper, we undertake an
analysis of the mean squared error by computing the Fisher information matrix
for a given threshold. Our results reveal that the optimal threshold can vary
considerably, depending on the variances and correlation coefficients. As a
result, it is inappropriate to use a constant threshold to encompass parameters
that vary widely. To mitigate this issue, we present a recovery scheme that
incorporates time-varying thresholds. Our approach differs from existing
methods in that it utilizes the exact values of the threshold, rather than its
statistical properties, to enhance the estimation performance. Our simulations,
including the direction-of-arrival estimation problem, demonstrate the efficacy
of the developed scheme, especially in complex scenarios where the covariance
elements are widely separated.

domain shift issues. We observe that the degradation is caused by two factors:
1) the large distribution gap over global positions of poses between the source

deficient diversity of local structures of poses in training. To this end, we
combine \textbf{global adaptation} and \textbf{local generalization} in
\textit{PoseDA}, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain
adaptation for 3D human pose estimation. Specifically, global adaptation aims
to align global positions of poses from the source domain to the target domain
with a proposed global position alignment (GPA) module. And local
generalization is designed to enhance the diversity of 2D-3D pose mapping with
a local pose augmentation (LPA) module. These modules bring significant
performance improvement without introducing additional learnable parameters. In
addition, we propose local pose augmentation (LPA) to enhance the diversity of
3D poses following an adversarial training scheme consisting of 1) a
augmentation generator that generates the parameters of pre-defined pose
transformations and 2) an anchor discriminator to ensure the reality and
quality of the augmented data. Our approach can be applicable to almost all

that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical
system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically,
a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian
matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic
equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: a) single-virus endemic
equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one
of the three viruses is alive; b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two
of the three viruses are alive; and c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all
three viruses survive in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient
condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary

3-coexistence equilibria (resp. for various forms of 2-coexistence equilibria).
We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence

focusing on acquiring transferable knowledge from unlabeled graph data to
improve downstream performance. Despite these recent endeavors, the problem of
negative transfer remains a major concern when utilizing graph pre-trained
models to downstream tasks. Previous studies made great efforts on the issue of
what to pre-train and how to pre-train by designing a variety of graph
pre-training and fine-tuning strategies. However, there are cases where even
the most advanced ""pre-train and fine-tune"" paradigms fail to yield distinct
benefits. This paper introduces a generic framework W2PGNN to answer the
crucial question of when to pre-train (i.e., in what situations could we take
advantage of graph pre-training) before performing effortful pre-training or
fine-tuning. We start from a new perspective to explore the complex generative
mechanisms from the pre-training data to downstream data. In particular, W2PGNN
first fits the pre-training data into graphon bases, each element of graphon
basis (i.e., a graphon) identifies a fundamental transferable pattern shared by
a collection of pre-training graphs. All convex combinations of graphon bases
give rise to a generator space, from which graphs generated form the solution
space for those downstream data that can benefit from pre-training. In this
manner, the feasibility of pre-training can be quantified as the generation
probability of the downstream data from any generator in the generator space.
W2PGNN offers three broad applications: providing the application scope of
graph pre-trained models, quantifying the feasibility of pre-training, and
assistance in selecting pre-training data to enhance downstream performance. We
provide a theoretically sound solution for the first application and extensive
empirical justifications for the latter two applications.

a finite-dimensional linear space $S$ of $\mathscr F$-measurable, bounded
functions on $\Omega$ so that on each atom $A$ of any $\sigma$-algebra
$\mathscr F_n$, all $L^p$-norms of functions in $S$ are comparable
independently of $n$ or $A$. Denote by $S_n$ the space of functions that are
given locally, on atoms of $\mathscr F_n$, by functions in $S$ and by $P_n$ the
orthoprojector (with respect to the inner product in $L^2(\Omega)$) onto $S_n$.
Since $S = \operatorname{span}\{1_\Omega\}$ satisfies the above assumption and
$P_n$ is then the conditional expectation $\mathbb E_n$ with respect to
$\mathscr F_n$, for such filtrations, martingales $(\mathbb E_n f)$ are special
cases of our setting. We show in this article that certain convergence results
that are known for martingales (or rather martingale differences) are also true
in the general framework described above. More precisely, we show that the
differences $(P_n - P_{n-1})f$ converge unconditionally and are democratic in
$L^p$ for $1<p<\infty$. This implies that those differences form a greedy basis
in $L^p$-spaces for $1<p<\infty$.

thermally activated skyrmions in confined geometries, as they are necessary for

the enhanced dynamics and degenerate non-equilibrium steady state of a system

compete with thermal fluctuations as well as current-induced spin-orbit
torques. The investigated system is a triangular-shaped confinement geometry
hosting four skyrmions, where we inject spin-polarized currents between two

analyze the intricacies of skyrmion arrangements of the skyrmion ensemble. In
the context of neuromorphic computing, such methods address the key challenge
of optimizing read-out positions in confined geometries and form the basis to
understand collective skyrmion dynamics in systems with competing interactions

important for many applications in robotics, graphics, and vision. Recent works
to reconstruct the 3D human and object from a single RGB image do not have
consistent relative translation across frames because they assume a fixed
depth. Moreover, their performance drops significantly when the object is
occluded. In this work, we propose a novel method to track the 3D human,
object, contacts between them, and their relative translation across frames
from a single RGB camera, while being robust to heavy occlusions. Our method is
built on two key insights. First, we condition our neural field reconstructions
for human and object on per-frame SMPL model estimates obtained by pre-fitting
SMPL to a video sequence. This improves neural reconstruction accuracy and
produces coherent relative translation across frames. Second, human and object
motion from visible frames provides valuable information to infer the occluded
object. We propose a novel transformer-based neural network that explicitly
uses object visibility and human motion to leverage neighbouring frames to make
predictions for the occluded frames. Building on these insights, our method is
able to track both human and object robustly even under occlusions. Experiments
on two datasets show that our method significantly improves over the

and $B(E2;0^+_1\to 2^+_1)$, have been investigated for the $N=50-82$ Sn nuclei
by applying the self-consistent approaches with the semi-realistic interaction
M3Y-P6. Both $E_x(2^+_1)$ and $B(E2;0^+_1\to 2^+_1)$ are well reproduced by the
spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov (HFB) plus quasiparticle random-phase
approximation (QRPA) calculations in $N\geq 64$, without adjustable parameters.
The measured $B(E2)$ values in the neutron-deficient Sn nuclei cast a puzzle.
In $54\leq N\leq 62$, the spherical HFB\,+\,QRPA calculations give too strong
$B(E2)$, opposite to the shell-model predictions within the one major shell.
Via the constrained-HFB (CHFB) calculations, it is found that the
neutron-deficient Sn nuclei are soft against the quadrupole deformation,
accounting for the limited applicability of the HFB\,+\,QRPA approach. In
particular, the potential energy curves (PECs) are almost flat in the range of
$|q_0|\lesssim 200\,\mathrm{fm}^2$ in $^{106-110}$Sn. We confirm that the near
degeneracy of $n0g_{7/2}$ and $n1d_{5/2}$ triggers weak quadrupole deformation
and its balance with the pairing makes PECs flat, which is qualitatively
consistent with a recent shell model result in an extended model space, by the
calculations shifting the single-particle energy spacing and the pairing
strength. These conclusions are supported by the proton-to-neutron ratios of
the transition matrix elements and the reference values of $B(E2)$ with the
angular-momentum projection on top of the CHFB solutions.

to smaller dimensions in order to reduce computational costs. However,
downsizing inputs makes the estimation more challenging because objects and
motion ranges become smaller. Even though recent approaches have demonstrated
high-quality flow estimation, they tend to fail to accurately model small
objects and precise boundaries when the input resolution is lowered,
restricting their applicability to high-resolution inputs. In this paper, we
introduce AnyFlow, a robust network that estimates accurate flow from images of
various resolutions. By representing optical flow as a continuous
coordinate-based representation, AnyFlow generates outputs at arbitrary scales
from low-resolution inputs, demonstrating superior performance over prior works
in capturing tiny objects with detail preservation on a wide range of scenes.
We establish a new state-of-the-art performance of cross-dataset generalization
on the KITTI dataset, while achieving comparable accuracy on the online
benchmarks to other SOTA methods.

  Algorithms","20 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce the Ensemble Kalman-Stein Gradient Descent
(EnKSGD) class of algorithms. The EnKSGD class of algorithms builds on the
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) line of work, applying techniques from sequential
data assimilation to unconstrained optimization and parameter estimation
problems. The essential idea is to exploit the EnKF as a black box (i.e.
derivative-free, zeroth order) optimization tool if iterated to convergence. In
this paper, we return to the foundations of the EnKF as a sequential data
assimilation technique, including its continuous-time and mean-field limits,
with the goal of developing faster optimization algorithms suited to noisy
black box optimization and inverse problems. The resulting EnKSGD class of
algorithms can be designed to both maintain the desirable property of
affine-invariance, and employ the well-known backtracking line search.
Furthermore, EnKSGD algorithms are designed to not necessitate the subspace
restriction property and variance collapse property of previous iterated EnKF
approaches to optimization, as both these properties can be undesirable in an
optimization context. EnKSGD also generalizes beyond the $L^{2}$ loss, and is
thus applicable to a wider class of problems than the standard EnKF. Numerical
experiments with both linear and nonlinear least squares problems, as well as
maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrate the faster convergence of EnKSGD
relative to alternative EnKF approaches to optimization.

these issues, we have identified a further challenge that currently seems
underappreciated - the potential distinction between trust as one construct and
\emph{distrust} as a second construct independent of trust. While there has
been long-standing academic discourse for this distinction and arguments for
both the one-dimensional and two-dimensional conceptualization of trust,
distrust seems relatively understudied in XAI. In this position paper, we not
only highlight the theoretical arguments for distrust as a distinct construct
from trust but also contextualize psychometric evidence that likewise favors a
distinction between trust and distrust. It remains to be investigated whether
the available psychometric evidence is sufficient for the existence of distrust
or whether distrust is merely a measurement artifact. Nevertheless, the XAI
community should remain receptive to considering trust and distrust for a more
comprehensive understanding of these two relevant constructs in XAI.

detection and measurement of biochemicals and metabolites. However, MRS has low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when concentrations of metabolites are in the range
of the million molars. Standard approach of using a high number of signal
averaging (NSA) to achieve sufficient NSR comes at the cost of a long
acquisition time. Purpose: We propose to use deep-learning approaches to
denoise MRS data without increasing the NSA. Methods: The study was conducted
using data collected from the brain spectroscopy phantom and human subjects. We
utilized a stack auto-encoder (SAE) network to train deep learning models for
denoising low NSA data (NSA = 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16) randomly truncated from high
SNR data collected with high NSA (NSA=192) which were also used to obtain the
ground truth. We applied both self-supervised and fully-supervised training
approaches and compared their performance of denoising low NSA data based on
improved SNRs. Results: With the SAE model, the SNR of low NSA data (NSA = 1)
obtained from the phantom increased by 22.8% and the MSE decreased by 47.3%.
For low NSA images of the human parietal and temporal lobes, the SNR increased
by 43.8% and the MSE decreased by 68.8%. In all cases, the chemical shift of
NAA in the denoised spectra closely matched with the high SNR spectra,
suggesting no distortion to the spectra from denoising. Furthermore, the
denoising performance of the SAE model was more effective in denoising spectra
with higher noise levels. Conclusions: The reported SAE denoising method is a
model-free approach to enhance the SNR of low NSA MRS data. With the denoising
capability, it is possible to acquire MRS data with a few NSA, resulting in
shorter scan times while maintaining adequate spectroscopic information for
detecting and quantifying the metabolites of interest.

on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the
elements in $E$ is connected. In this paper, we consider hypergraphs defined on
a host graph. Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, with $c:V\to\{\mathbf{r},\mathbf{b}\}$,
and a collection of connected subgraphs $\mathcal{H}$ of $G$, a primal support
is a graph $Q$ on $\mathbf{b}(V)$ such that for each $H\in \mathcal{H}$, the
induced subgraph $Q[\mathbf{b}(H)]$ on vertices $\mathbf{b}(H)=H\cap
c^{-1}(\mathbf{b})$ is connected. A \emph{dual support} is a graph $Q^*$ on
$\mathcal{H}$ s.t. for each $v\in X$, the induced subgraph $Q^*[\mathcal{H}_v]$
is connected, where $\mathcal{H}_v=\{H\in\mathcal{H}: v\in H\}$. We present
sufficient conditions on the host graph and hyperedges so that the resulting
support comes from a restricted family.
  We primarily study two classes of graphs: $(1)$ If the host graph has genus
$g$ and the hypergraphs satisfy a topological condition of being
\emph{cross-free}, then there is a primal and a dual support of genus at most
$g$. $(2)$ If the host graph has treewidth $t$ and the hyperedges satisfy a
combinatorial condition of being \emph{non-piercing}, then there exist primal
and dual supports of treewidth $O(2^t)$. We show that this exponential blow-up
is sometimes necessary. As an intermediate case, we also study the case when
the host graph is outerplanar. Finally, we show applications of our results to
packing and covering, and coloring problems on geometric hypergraphs.

convection and magmatism in a two-dimensional polar rectangular mantle.
Magmatism occurs as an upward permeable flow of magma generated by
decompression melting through the convecting matrix. The mantle is assumed to
be initially enriched in heat-producing elements (HPEs) and compositionally
dense ilmenite-bearing cumulates (IBC) at its base. Here, we newly show that
magma generation and migration play a crucial role in the calculated volcanic
and radial expansion/contraction history. Magma is generated in the deep mantle
by internal heating for the first several hundred million years. A large volume
of the generated magma ascends to the surface as partially molten fingers and
plumes driven by melt-buoyancy to cause a volcanic activity and radial
expansion of the planet with the peak at 3.5-4 Gyr ago. Eventually, however,
the planet begins to radially contract when the mantle solidifies by cooling
from the surface boundary. As the mantle is cooled, the activity of partially
molten plumes declines but continues for billions of years after the peak
because some basal materials enriched in the dense IBC components hold HPEs.
The calculated volcanic and radial expansion/contraction history is consistent
with the observed history of the Moon. Our simulations suggest a substantial
fraction of the mantle was solid, and there was a basal layer enriched in HPEs
and the IBC components at the beginning of the history of the Moon.

propose a method that does not require data augmentation, and that, differently

expanded into four categories: failed with a suitable safety factor, intact
with a suitable safety factor, failed without a suitable safety factor, and
intact without a suitable safety factor. There are five inputs used for each
model: pillar width, mining height, bord width, depth to floor, and ratio. The
results showed that the ANN-BP model with Ensemble Learning could improve

consists in learning feature functions that are used as constraints to solve
for a functional map inside the network. However, the precise nature of the
information learned and stored in these functions is not yet well understood.
Specifically, a major question is whether these features can be used for any
other objective, apart from their purely algebraic role in solving for
functional map matrices. In this paper, we show that under some mild

used as point-wise descriptors and thus are directly comparable across
different shapes, even without the necessity of solving for a functional map at
test time. Furthermore, informed by our analysis, we propose effective
modifications to the standard deep functional map pipeline, which promote
structural properties of learned features, significantly improving the matching
results. Finally, we demonstrate that previously unsuccessful attempts at using
extrinsic architectures for deep functional map feature extraction can be
remedied via simple architectural changes, which encourage the theoretical

well-defined probabilistic model. However, extension of ICA to the nonlinear

disordered systems such as spin glasses and other complex systems. It is able
to analytically and asymptotically exactly describe the equilibrium properties

very basic questions such as the limiting energy of a fast quench are so far
open. The dynamical cavity method partly fills this gap by considering short
trajectories and leveraging the static cavity method. However, being limited to
a couple of steps forward from the initialization it does not capture many of
the interesting dynamical properties that appear at later times in the
dynamics. We introduce the backtracking dynamical cavity method that instead of
analysing the trajectory forward from initialization, analyses trajectories
that are found by tracking them backward from attractors. We illustrate that
this rather elementary twist on the dynamical cavity method leads to new
insight into some of the very basic questions about the dynamics of complex
disordered systems. This method is as versatile as the cavity method itself and
we hence anticipate that our paper will open many avenues for future research
of dynamical, out-of-equilibrium, properties in complex systems.

estimation techniques are inefficient due to the huge pilot dimensionality that

if we consider the mobility of the users where the channel needs to be

much fewer than the number of RIS elements. The proposed scheme is also shown
to be capable of effectively tracking the channel when the user moves around in

lossless measurement transformation of sensor measurements has been proposed

which is a fundamental and important problem for multitarget tracking. First,
since the optimal track association problem is a multi-dimensional assignment
(MDA) problem, we demonstrate that MDA-based data association (with and without

lossless, and is equivalent to that using raw track measurements. Second,
recent superior scalability and performance of belief propagation (BP)

resource-limited devices. Thus, we present a BP-based multisensor track
association method with transformed measurements and show that it is equivalent
to that with raw measurements. Third, considering communication constraints, it
is more beneficial for local sensors to send in compressed data. Two analytical

multi-view, multi-task classification model based on the Sauvegrain method. A
straightforward solution to automating the Sauvegrain method, which assesses a
maturity score for each landmark in the elbow and predicts the bone age, is to
train classifiers independently to score each region of interest (RoI), but
this approach limits the accessible information to local morphologies and
increases computational costs. As a result, this work proposes a
self-accumulative vision transformer (SAT) that mitigates anisotropic behavior,
which usually occurs in multi-view, multi-task problems and limits the
effectiveness of a vision transformer, by applying token replay and regional
attention bias. A number of experiments show that SAT successfully exploits the
relationships between landmarks and learns global morphological features,
resulting in a mean absolute error of BAA that is 0.11 lower than that of the
previous work. Additionally, the proposed SAT has four times reduced parameters
than an ensemble of individual classifiers of the previous work. Lastly, this
work also provides informative implications for clinical practice, improving
the accuracy and efficiency of BAA in diagnosing abnormal growth in
adolescents.

the qualitative behaviour of such probabilities as a function of the mutation

study presents a high-performance cloud removal architecture called Progressive
Multi-scale Attention Autoencoder (PMAA), which simultaneously leverages global
and local information. It mainly consists of a cloud detection backbone and a
cloud removal module. The cloud detection backbone uses cloud masks to
reinforce cloudy areas to prompt the cloud removal module. The cloud removal
module mainly comprises a novel Multi-scale Attention Module (MAM) and a Local
Interaction Module (LIM). PMAA establishes the long-range dependency of
multi-scale features using MAM and modulates the reconstruction of the
fine-grained details using LIM, allowing for the simultaneous representation of
fine- and coarse-grained features at the same level. With the help of diverse
and multi-scale feature representation, PMAA outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art model CTGAN consistently on the Sen2_MTC_Old and Sen2_MTC_New
datasets. Furthermore, PMAA has a considerable efficiency advantage, with only
0.5% and 14.6% of the parameters and computational complexity of CTGAN,

the form of particulate dispersions in industrial applications, e.g., for the

processes. Under acidic conditions, colloidal boehmite dispersions at rest form
gels, i.e., space-spanning percolated networks that behave as soft solids at
rest, and yet yield and flow like liquids under large enough deformations. Like
many other colloidal gels, the solid-like properties of boehmite gels at rest
are very sensitive to their previous mechanical history. Our recent work
[Sudreau et al., J. Rheol. 66, 91-104 (2022), and Phys. Rev. Material 6,
L042601 (2022)] has revealed such \textit{memory effects}, where the shear
experienced prior to flow cessation drives the elasticity of boehmite gels:
while gels formed following application of a shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$
larger than a critical value $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$ are insensitive to shear
history, gels formed after application of $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}<\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$ display reinforced viscoelastic properties and non-negligible residual
stresses. Here, we provide a microstructural scenario for these striking
observations by coupling rheometry and small-angle X-ray scattering.
Time-resolved measurements for $\dot\gamma_{\rm p} <\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$ show
that scattering patterns develop an anisotropic shape that persists upon flow
cessation, whereas gels exposed to $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}>\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$
display isotropic scattering patterns upon flow cessation. Moreover, as the
shear rate applied prior to flow cessation is decreased below $\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$, the level of anisotropy frozen in the sample microstructure grows
similarly to the viscoelastic properties, thus providing a direct link between
mechanical reinforcement and flow-induced microstructural anisotropy.

manual inspection is costly and traditional means, such as rule-based bug
detection, are not robust enough to follow the pace of the emergence of new

in such situations as models can be trained to detect vulnerable patterns.

vulnerability against multiple representation types and evaluated them by a
number of machine learning models as a baseline. The evaluation is done on a

foresees international cooperation on matters related to preservation plans for

of a diversity of values to be protected via the aforementioned framework, and

ridesharing systems, in which interactions between ridesharing drivers,
passengers, platforms, and transportation networks are endogenously captured.
Stable matching is modeled as an equilibrium problem in which no ridesharing
driver or passenger can reduce ridesharing disutility by unilaterally switching
to another matching sequence. This paper is one of the first studies that
explicitly integrates the ridesharing platform multi-passenger matching problem
into the model. By integrating matching sequence with hyper-network,
ridesharing-passenger transfers are avoided in a multi-passenger ridesharing
system. Moreover, the matching stability between the ridesharing drivers and
passengers is extended to address the multi-OD multi-passenger case in terms of
matching sequence. The paper provides a proof for the existence of the proposed
general equilibrium. A sequence-bush algorithm is developed for solving the
multi-passenger ridesharing equilibrium problem. This algorithm is capable to
handle complex ridesharing constraints implicitly. Results illustrate that the
proposed sequence-bush algorithm outperforms general-purpose solver, and
provides insights into the equilibrium of the joint stable matching and route
choice problem. Numerical experiments indicate that ridesharing trips are
typically longer than average trip lengths. Sensitivity analysis suggests that
a properly designed ridesharing unit price is necessary to achieve network
benefits, and travelers with relatively lower values of time are more likely to
participate in ridesharing.

and computationally intensive task. Density functional theory provides, in many

machine-learning models in the workflow for the construction of ternary convex
hull diagrams. In particular, we train a set of spectral neighbour-analysis
potentials (SNAPs) over readily available binary phases and we establish
whether this is good enough to predict the energies of novel ternaries. Such a
strategy does not require any new calculations specific for the construction of
the model, but just avails of data stored in binary-phase-diagram repositories.
We find that a so-constructed SNAP is capable of accurate total-energy
estimates for ternary phases close to the equilibrium geometry but, in general,
is not able to perform atomic relaxation. This is because during a typical
relaxation path a given phase traverses regions in the parameter space poorly
represented by the training set. Different metrics are then investigated to
assess how an unknown structure is well described by a given SNAP model, and we
find that the standard deviation of an ensemble of SNAPs provides a fast and

inference problems. The corresponding difference-based estimator, which avoids
detrending, has attracted considerable interest due to its robustness to both
smooth and abrupt structural breaks and its competitive finite sample
performance. However, existing methods mainly focus on estimators for the
univariate process while their direct and multivariate extensions for most
linear models are asymptotically biased. We propose a novel difference-based
and debiased long-run covariance matrix estimator for functional linear models
with time-varying regression coefficients, allowing time series
non-stationarity, long-range dependence, state-heteroscedasticity and their
mixtures. We apply the new estimator to i) the structural stability test,
overcoming the notorious non-monotonic power phenomena caused by piecewise
smooth alternatives for regression coefficients, and (ii) the nonparametric
residual-based tests for long memory, improving the performance via the
residual-free formula of the proposed estimator. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is justified theoretically and demonstrated by superior
performance in simulation studies, while its usefulness is elaborated by means
of real data analysis.

composed of two tasks: (1) Learning the generative model that is trained over a
set of 3D landmark sequences, and (2) Generating 3D mesh sequences of an input
facial mesh driven by the generated landmark sequences. The generative model is
based on a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which has achieved
remarkable success in generative tasks of other domains. While it can be
trained unconditionally, its reverse process can still be conditioned by
various condition signals. This allows us to efficiently develop several
downstream tasks involving various conditional generation, by using expression
labels, text, partial sequences, or simply a facial geometry. To obtain the
full mesh deformation, we then develop a landmark-guided encoder-decoder to
apply the geometrical deformation embedded in landmarks on a given facial mesh.

regime for the control of the relative motion within a satellite formation is a
promising option as any thrusting device has tremendous effects on the mission
capacity due to the limited weight and size restrictions of small satellites.
One possible approach to increase the available control forces is to reduce the
mass of the respective satellites as well as to increase the available surface
area. However, satellites of these characteristics suffer from rapid orbital
decay and consequently have a reduced service lifetime. Therefore, achieving
higher control forces is in contradiction to achieving a minimum orbital decay
of the satellites, which currently represents one of the biggest challenges in
the VLEO regime. In this work, the geometry of a given reference satellite, a
3UCubeSat, is optimized under the consideration of different surface material
properties for differential lift and drag control applications while
simultaneously ensuring a sustained VLEO operation. Notably, not only the
consideration of sustainability but also the optimization with regard to
differential lift is new in literature. It was shown that the advantageous
geometries strongly depend on the type of gas-surface interaction and thus, two
different final designs, one for each extreme type, are presented. In both
cases, improvements in all relevant parameters could be achieved solely via

We show how this follows, intuitively, as a direct consequence of the increased
gravitational field strength at distances below the compactification scale.
Combining these results with the heuristic identification between the Compton
wavelength and the minimum value of the position uncertainty, due to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, suggests the existence of generalised,
higher-dimensional uncertainty relations. These relations may be expected to
hold for self-gravitating quantum wave packets, in higher-dimensional
spacetimes, with interesting implications for particle physics and cosmology in
extra-dimensional scenarios.

BEV, electric road systems (ERS) for dynamic power transfer are discussed, as
well as indirect electrification with trucks that use hydrogen fuel cells or
e-fuels. Here we investigate the power sector implications of these alternative
options. We apply an open-source capacity expansion model to future scenarios
of Germany with high renewable energy shares, drawing on detailed route-based
truck traffic data. Results show that power sector costs are lowest for
flexibly charged BEV that also carry out vehicle-to-grid operations, and
highest for HDV using e-fuels. If BEV and ERS-BEV are not charged in an
optimized way, power sector costs increase, but are still substantially lower
than in scenarios with hydrogen or e-fuels. This is a consequence of the
relatively poor energy efficiency of indirect HDV electrification, which
outweighs its temporal flexibility benefits. We further find a higher use of
solar PV for BEV and ERS-BEV, and a higher use of wind power and, to some
extent, fossil generators for hydrogen and e-fuels.

is a popular technique where the goal is to generate a high-resolution version
of a given low-resolution input. The majority of modern super-resolution
approaches use convolutional neural networks. However, convolution itself is a
linear operation and the networks rely on the non-linear activation functions
after each layer to provide the necessary non-linearity to learn the complex

replacing the convolutional filters with learnable non-linear functions through
the use of MacLaurin series expansions. This work focuses on extending the

relativistic pair plasma energized by reconnection of strong magnetic fields is
investigated with two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. The simulations in this 2D/3D comparison study are conducted with
the radiative PIC code OSIRIS, which self-consistently accounts for the
synchrotron radiation reaction on the emitting particles, and enables us to
explore the effects of synchrotron cooling. Magnetic reconnection causes
compression of the plasma and magnetic field deep inside magnetic islands
(plasmoids), leading to an enhancement of the flaring emission, which may help
explain some astrophysical gamma-ray flare observations. Although radiative
cooling weakens the emission from plasmoid cores, it facilitates additional
compression there, further amplifying the magnetic field $B$ and plasma
density~$n$, and thus partially mitigating this effect. Novel simulation
diagnostics utilizing 2D histograms in the $n\mbox{-}B$ space are developed and
used to visualize and quantify the effects of compression. The $n\mbox{-}B$
histograms are observed to be bounded by relatively sharp power-law boundaries
marking clear limits on compression. Theoretical explanations for some of these
compression limits are developed, rooted in radiative resistivity or 3D kinking
instabilities. Systematic parameter-space studies with respect to guide
magnetic field, system size, and upstream magnetization are conducted and
suggest that stronger compression, brighter high-energy radiation, and perhaps
significant quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects such as pair production, may
occur in environments with larger reconnection-region sizes and higher
magnetization, particularly when magnetic field strengths approach the critical
(Schwinger) field, as found in magnetar magnetospheres.

The first one is related to one claim of \citep{Donato} D09, namely: is the DM
surface density (DMsd) a constant universal quantity, equal to $\log{(\rm
\Sigma/M_\odot pc^{-2})}=2.15 \pm 0.2$, or does it depend on the baryon surface
density of the system? The second one, is based on a MOND prediction that for
HSBs the DMsd is constant, and equal to $\log{(\rm \Sigma/M_\odot
pc^{-2})}=2.14$, while for LSBs the surface density is not constant and takes
values that are smaller than for HSBs and D09 prediction \citep{Milgrom2009}.
We find that HSBs shows a constant DMsd vs magnitude as in D09, and a constant
DMsd vs $\Sigma_{\rm eff}$ as in MOND prediction, for HSBs with $\Sigma_{\rm
eff}>200 L_\odot/pc^2$, and $\Sigma_{\rm eff}>300 L_\odot/pc^2$. However, the
value of the DMsd is larger, $\Sigma \simeq 2.61$ (in the case of the
DMsd-magnitude with $\Sigma_{\rm eff}>300 L_\odot/pc^2$), and $\Sigma \simeq
2.54$ (in the case of the surface DMsd-surface brightness with $\Sigma_{\rm
eff}>200 L_\odot/pc^2$). This value slightly depends on the threshold to
determine wheter a galaxy is HSB. In the case of LSBs, for $\Sigma_{\rm
eff}<100 L_\odot/pc^2$, and $\Sigma_{\rm eff}<25 L_\odot/pc^2$, the surface
density vs magnitude, for lower magnitudes, is approximately equal to that
predicted by D09, but several galaxies, for magnitude $M>-17$, have smaller
values than those predicted by D09. The DMsd vs $\Sigma_{\rm eff}$ shows a
similar behavior in qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with MOND
predictions. In summary, in the case of HSBs both D09 and MOND are in
qualitative, but not quantitative, agreement with the data. In the case of LSBs
D09 is mainly in disagreement with the data, and MOND only in qualitative
agreement with them.

We present an approach for price optimization that combines population
statistics, purchase history and conjoint data in a systematic way. We build on
the recent advances in causal inference to identify and quantify the effect of
price on the purchase probability at the customer level. The identification
task is a transportability problem whose solution requires a parametric
assumption on the differences between the conjoint study and real purchases.
The causal effect is estimated using Bayesian methods that take into account

Several variants of variational autoencoders have been proposed to learn
compact data representaitons by encoding high-dimensional data in a lower
dimensional space. Two main classes of VAEs methods may be distinguished
depending on the characteristics of the meta-priors that are enforced in the
representation learning step. The first class of methods derives a continuous
encoding by assuming a static prior distribution in the latent space. The
second class of methods learns instead a discrete latent representation using
vector quantization (VQ) along with a codebook. However, both classes of
methods suffer from certain challenges, which may lead to suboptimal image
reconstruction results. The first class of methods suffers from posterior
collapse, whereas the second class of methods suffers from codebook collapse.
To address these challenges, we introduce a new VAE variant, termed SC-VAE
(sparse coding-based VAE), which integrates sparse coding within variational
autoencoder framework. Instead of learning a continuous or discrete latent
representation, the proposed method learns a sparse data representation that
consists of a linear combination of a small number of learned atoms. The sparse

addressing them, engaging stakeholders in the innovation process, and continue
advancing QT (SEA). We further suggest operationalizing the SEA-framework by
establishing quantum-specific guiding principles. The impact of quantum
computing on information security is used as a case study to illustrate (1) the
need for a framework that guides Responsible QT, and (2) the usefulness of the
SEA-framework for QT generally. Additionally, we examine how our proposed
SEA-framework for responsible innovation can inform the emergent regulatory

for QT as base-layer technology could be designed, contextualized, and tailored
to their exceptional nature in order to reduce the risk of unintended
counterproductive effects of policy interventions. Laying the groundwork for a
responsible quantum ecosystem, the research community and other stakeholders

multi-class classifications over real-world data. In this paper, we address
this limitation by extending the neural DNF module to (i) support rule learning

the symbolic property of mutual exclusivity (i.e. predicting exactly one class)

process mining. Instead of assuming a single case notion present in the event
log, OCPD can handle events without a single case notion, but that are instead
related to a collection of objects each having a certain type. The object types
constitute multiple, interacting case notions. The output of OCPD is an
object-centric Petri net, i.e. a Petri net with object-typed places, that
represents the parallel execution of multiple execution flows corresponding to
object types. Similar to classical process discovery, where we aim for
behaviorally sound process models as a result, in OCPD, we aim for soundness of
the resulting object-centric Petri nets. However, the existing OCPD approach
can result in violations of soundness. As we will show, one violation arises
for multiple interacting object types with loops that arise in collaborative
systems. This paper proposes an extended OCPD approach and proves that it does
not suffer from this violation of soundness of the resulting object-centric

spurious interactions in the discovered object-centric Petri net. The proposed

resolution of data. This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)
that super-resolves instantaneous snapshots of three-dimensional air
temperature and wind velocity fields for urban micrometeorology. This
super-resolution process requires not only an increase in spatial resolution
but also the restoration of missing data caused by the difference in the
building shapes that depend on the resolution. The proposed CNN incorporates
gated convolution, which is an image inpainting technique that infers missing
pixels. The CNN performance has been verified via supervised learning utilizing
building-resolving micrometeorological simulations around Tokyo Station in
Japan. The CNN successfully reconstructed the temperature and velocity fields
around the high-resolution buildings, despite the missing data at lower
altitudes due to the coarseness of the low-resolution buildings. This result
implies that near-surface flows can be inferred from flows above buildings.
This hypothesis was assessed via numerical experiments where all input values
below a certain height were made missing. This research suggests the
possibility that building-resolving micrometeorological simulations become more
practical for urban cities with the aid of neural networks that enhance

perturbative corrections arising from the series of $\alpha^\prime$- and

two-dimensional cylindrical bubble are investigated based on the discrete
Boltzmann method (DBM). Besides some interesting Hydrodynamic Non-Equilibrium
(HNE) behaviors, some relevant Thermodynamic Non-Equilibrium (TNE) behaviors
are carefully studied. It is found that the viscosity contributes little effect
on the dynamic processes in the shock compression stage but significantly
influences them in the post-shock stage. A bubble with a smaller viscosity
coefficient displays a stouter jet structure, can be compressed more easily,
and reaches its minimum characteristic scales slower. The viscosity accelerates
the average motion of the bubble, reduces the vorticity strength (circulation),
and restrains the material mixing between the ambient gas and the bubble. The
viscous effects on different TNE quantities/perspectives show interesting
differences. These differences indicate the complexity of TNE behaviors, which
still requires further understanding. The viscous effects on entropy production
are also investigated. It is found that the entropy production caused by the
non-organized momentum flux (NOMF) is larger than that caused by the
non-organized energy flux (NOEF). As the Prandtl number increases, the entropy
production $S_{\rm{NOMF}}$ increases. But the $S_{\rm{NOEF}}$ first decreases

cosmological perturbations provide access to the early Universe through their
associated observational signatures. In particular, enhanced cosmological
perturbations collapsing to form PBHs are responsible for the generation of a
stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) induced by second-order
gravitational interactions, usually called scalar induced gravitational waves
(SIGWs). This SGWB is sensitive to the underlying gravitational theory; hence
it can be used as a novel tool to test the standard paradigm of gravity and
constrain possible deviations from general relativity. In this work, we study
the aforementioned GW signal within modified teleparallel gravity theories,
developing a formalism for the derivation of the GW spectral abundance within
any form of gravitational action. At the end, working within viable $f(T,\phi)$
models without matter-gravity couplings, and accounting for the effect of
mono-parametric $f(T)$ gravity at the level of the source and the propagation
of the tensor perturbations, we show that the respective GW signal is
indistinguishable from that within GR. Interestingly, we find that in order to
break the degeneracy between different $f(T)$ theories through the portal of
SIGWs one should necessarily consider non-minimal matter-gravity couplings at
the level of the gravitational action.

across time. We propose a two-step procedure to estimate the rates of mortality
improvement (RMI) in age-specific death rates (ASDR) at ages 85 and above for
ten European countries from 1950 to 2019. In the first step, we smooth the raw
death counts and estimate ASDR using four different methods: one parametric
(gamma-Gompertz-Makeham), two non-parametric (P-splines and PCLM), and a novel
Bayesian procedure to handle fluctuations resulting from ages with zero death
counts. We compare the goodness of fit of the four smoothing methods and
calculate the year-to-year ASDR differences according to the best-fitting one.
We fit a piecewise linear function to these differences in the second step. The
slope in each linear segment captures the average RMI in the respective year
range. For each age, we calculate the goodness of fit in the last linear
segment to assess how informative the estimated RMI of current mortality change
is. The estimated rates of mortality improvement or deterioration (RMI) can be
used to make short-term social, health, and social planning, as well as more
precise mortality forecasts.

These are significant increases over the previously known lower bounds and the

that every satisfiable HyperCTL* sentence has a model that is equinumerous to

every weighted constraint function $f$ defining the problem (the weights can
even be negative), the problem is either computable in polynomial time if $f$
satisfies a tractability criterion, or \#P-hard otherwise. One particular
problem in this problem space is a long-standing open problem of Moore and
Robson on counting Cubic Planar X3C. The dichotomy resolves this problem by
showing that it is \numP-hard. Our proof relies on the machinery of signature
theory developed in the study of Holant problems. An essential ingredient in
our proof of the main dichotomy theorem is a pure graph-theoretic result:
Excepting some trivial cases, every 3-regular plane graph has a planar 3-way
edge perfect matching. The proof technique of this graph-theoretic result is a
combination of algebraic and combinatorial methods.
  The P-time tractability criterion of the dichotomy is explicit. Other than
the known classes of tractable constraint functions (degenerate, affine,
product type, matchgates-transformable) we also identify a new infinite set of
P-time computable planar Holant problems; however, its tractability is not by a
direct holographic transformation to matchgates, but by a combination of this
method and a global argument. The complexity dichotomy states that everything
else in this Holant class is \#P-hard.

crucial step towards identifying the nearest Earth-like planets. One of the
main challenges in this search is that M dwarfs can be magnetically active and
stellar activity can produce radial velocity (RV) signals that could mimic
those of a planet.
  Aims: We aim to investigate whether the 2.2 day period observed in optical
RVs of the nearby active M dwarf star Gl 388 (AD Leo) is due to stellar
activity or to a planet that corotates with the star as suggested in the past.
  Methods: We obtained quasi-simultaneous optical RVs of Gl 388 from 2019 to
2021 with SOPHIE (R~75k) at the OHP in France, and near-IR RV and Stokes V
measurements with SPIRou at the CFHT (R~70k).
  Results: The SOPHIE RV time series displays a periodic signal with a
2.23+-0.01 day period and 23.6+-0.5 m/s amplitude, which is consistent with
previous HARPS observations obtained in 2005-2006. The SPIRou RV time series is
flat at 5 m/s rms and displays no periodic signals. RV signals of amplitude
higher than 5.3 m/s at a period of 2.23 days can be excluded with a confidence
level higher than 99%. Using the modulation of the longitudinal magnetic field
(Bl) measured with SPIRou, we derive a stellar rotation period of
2.2305+-0.0016 days.
  Conclusions: SPIRou RV measurements provide solid evidence that the periodic
variability of the optical RVs of Gl 388 is due to stellar activity rather than
to a corotating planet. The magnetic activity nature of the optical RV signal
is further confirmed by the modulation of Bl with the same period. The SPIRou
campaign on Gl 388 demonstrates the power of near-IR RV to confirm or infirm
planet candidates discovered in the optical around active stars. SPIRou

derive the asymptotically exact semiclassical/infrared limit of the LW
functional at large distances, $r \gg \lambda_F$, and large times, $\tau \gg
1/E_F$, where $\lambda_F$ and $E_F$ are the Fermi wavelength and the Fermi
energy, respectively. The LW functional is represented by skeleton diagrams,
each skeleton diagram consists of appropriately connected dressed fermion
loops. First, we prove that every $D$-dimensional skeleton diagram consisting
of a single fermion loop is reduced to a one-dimensional (1D) fermion loop with
the same diagrammatic structure, which justifies the name dimensional
reduction. This statement, combined with the fermion loop cancellation theorem
(FLCT), agrees with results of multidimensional bosonization. Here we show that
the backscattering and the spectral curvature, both explicitly violate the FLCT
and both are irrelevant for a 1DEG, become relevant at $D > 1$ and $D > 2$,
respectively. The reason for this is a strong infrared divergence of the
skeleton diagrams containing multiple fermion loops at $D > 1$. These diagrams,
which are omitted within the multidimensional bosonization approaches, account
for the non-collinear scattering processes. Thus, the dimensional reduction
provides the framework to go beyond predictions of the multidimensional
bosonization. A simple diagrammatic structure of the reduced LW functional is
another advantage of our approach. The dimensional reduction technique is also
applicable to the thermodynamic potential and various approximations, from
perturbation theory to self-consistent approaches.

expressed in claims and corresponding users' response posts affect their
sharing behavior on social media. Analysis of four data sets covering different

their claims depending on the topic area to pass targeted emotions to their
audience. By analysing responses to claims, we show that the credibility of the
claim influences the distribution of emotions that the claim incites in its
audience. Moreover, our analysis shows that emotions expressed in the claims
are repeated in the users' responses. Finally, the analysis of users' sharing
behavior shows that negative emotional framing such as anger, fear, and sadness
of false claims leads to more interaction among users than positive emotions.
This analysis also reveals that in the claims that trigger happy responses,
true claims result in more sharing compared to false claims.

orientations of rotating UEs can be predicted via embedded motion sensors. The
problem is formulated as a finite-horizon MDP with non-stationary state
transition probabilities. A novel low-complexity solution framework is proposed
via one iteration step over a base policy whose average future cost can be
predicted with analytical expressions. It is demonstrated by simulations that
compared with existing benchmarks, the proposed scheme can schedule the
downlink transmission and suppress the packet drop rate efficiently in
non-stationary mmWave links.

Particular attention will be given to gradient dependent examples with the
requisite sufficient monotonicity of proper ellipticity and directionality in
the gradient. Example operators we will discuss include the degenerate elliptic
operators of optimal transport in which the target density is strictly
increasing in some directions as well as operators which are weakly parabolic

options among a set of preset candidate views and select the next-best-view
from them. In contrast to these, we take the emerging implicit representation
as the object model and seamlessly combine it with the active reconstruction

supervision method specifically for object-level reconstruction that considers
both valid and free space. Additionally, to directly evaluate view information
from the implicit object model, we introduce a sample-based uncertainty
evaluation method. It samples points on rays directly from the object model and
uses variations of implicit function inferences as the uncertainty metrics,
with no need for voxel traversal or an additional information map. Leveraging
the differentiability of our metrics, it is possible to optimize the
next-best-view by maximizing the uncertainty continuously. This does away with
the traditionally-used candidate views setting, which may provide sub-optimal
results. Experiments in simulations and real-world scenes show that our method
effectively improves the reconstruction accuracy and the view-planning

of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) can not be deduced by any
observational method that appeals to an a priori thermalisation to the CMB
temperature $T$ of the excited states in a probe environment of independently
determined redshift $z$. For example, this applies to quasar-light absorption
by a damped Lyman-alpha system due to atomic as well as ionic fine-splitting
transitions or molecular rotational bands. Similarly, the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (thSZ) effect cannot be used to extract the CMB's $T$-$z$
relation. This is because the relative line strengths between ground and
excited states in the former and the CMB spectral distortion in the latter case
both depend, apart from environment specific normalisations, solely on the
dimensionless spectral variable $x=\frac{h\nu}{k_B T}$. Since literature on
extractions of the CMB's $T$-$z$ relation always assumes (i)
$\nu(z)=(1+z)\nu(z=0)$ where $\nu(z=0)$ is the observed frequency in the
heliocentric rest frame, the finding (ii) $T(z)=(1+z)T(z=0)$ just confirms the
expected blackbody nature of the interacting CMB at $z>0$. In contrast to
emission of isolated, directed radiation, whose frequency-redshift relation
($\nu$-$z$ relation) is subject to (i), a non-conventional $\nu$-$z$ relation
$\nu(z)=f(z)\nu(z=0)$ of pure, isotropic blackbody radiation, subject to
adiabatically slow cosmic expansion, necessarily has to follow that of the
$T$-$z$ relation $T(z)=f(z)T(z=0)$ and vice versa. In general, the function
$f(z)$ is determined by energy conservation of the CMB fluid in a
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe. If the pure CMB is subject to an
SU(2) rather than a U(1) gauge principle, then $f(z)=
\left({1/4}\right)^{1/3}(1+z)$ for $z\gg 1$, and $f(z)$ is nonlinear for $z\sim
1$.

benchmarked on a set of robot problems that are challenging from a numerical

0.3$ and angular frequencies $10^{2} \le \omega \le 10^{7}$, with a fixed
Prandtl number of 4.38. The flow visualisation shows the transition behaviour
of flow structure upon the varying frequency, characterising three distinct
regimes, which are the periodic-circulation regime, columnar regime and
columnar-broken regime. Different statistical properties are distinguished from
the temperature and velocity fluctuations at the boundary layer and mid-height.
Upon transition into the columnar regime, columnar thermal coherent structures
are formed, in contrast to the periodic oscillating circulation. These columns
are contributed by merging of thermal plumes near the boundary layer, and the
resultant thermal updrafts remain at almost fixed lateral position, leading to
a decrease in fluctuations. We further find that the critical point of this
transition can be described nicely by the vibrational Rayleigh number
$Ra_\mathrm{vib}$. As the frequency continues to increase, entering the
so-called columnar-broken regime, the columnar structures are broken, and
eventually the flow state becomes a large-scale circulation, characterised by a
sudden increase in fluctuations. Finally, a phase diagram is constructed to

In this paper, we introduce Imitation learning from Language Feedback (ILF), a

three steps that are applied iteratively: first, conditioning the language
model on the input, an initial LM output, and feedback to generate refinements.
Second, selecting the refinement incorporating the most feedback. Third,
finetuning the language model to maximize the likelihood of the chosen
refinement given the input. We show theoretically that ILF can be viewed as
Bayesian Inference, similar to Reinforcement Learning from human feedback. We
evaluate ILF's effectiveness on a carefully-controlled toy task and a realistic
summarization task. Our experiments demonstrate that large language models
accurately incorporate feedback and that finetuning with ILF scales well with
the dataset size, even outperforming finetuning on human summaries. Learning
from both language and comparison feedback outperforms learning from each

have revealed a periodicity in their bursting activity that may be suggestive
of a binary origin for the modulation. We set out to explore the scenario where
a subset of repeating FRBs originates in binary systems hosting a highly
energetic neutron star and a massive companion star, akin to $\gamma$-ray
binaries and young High-Mass X-ray Binaries. Firstly, we specifically focus on
the host galaxy properties and binary formation rates. Subsequently, we
investigate the expected evolution of the rotation and dispersion measure in
this scenario, the predicted birth-site offsets, and the origin of the
persistent radio emission observed in a subset of these systems. The host
galaxies for repeating FRBs favour the formation of neutron star-massive star
binary systems but any conclusive evidence will require future discoveries and
localizations of FRBs. The birth rate of high-mass X-ray binaries, used as a
proxy for all considered binaries, significantly exceeds the estimated rate of
FRBs, which can be explained if only a small subset of these systems produce
FRBs. We show that under simple assumptions, we can reproduce the DM and RM
evolution that is seen in a subset of repeating FRBs. We also discuss the
possibility of detecting a persistent radio source associated with the FRB due
to an intra-binary shock between companion star wind and either the pulsar wind
or giant magnetar flares. The observed long-term luminosity stability of the
Persistent Radio Sources is most consistent with a giant flare-powered
scenario. However, this explanation is highly dependent on the magnetic field
properties of the neutron star. With these explorations, we have aimed to
provide a framework to discuss future FRB observations in the context of
neutron star-massive star binary scenarios.

unprecedented access to the Sun's poles. This provides excellent opportunities

from both instruments obtained during Solar Orbiter's inferior conjunction on 7
March 2022. The HRT data were additionally treated for geometric distortion and
degraded to the same resolution as HMI. The HMI data were re-projected to
correct for the $3^{\circ}$ separation between the two observatories.
SO/PHI-HRT and HMI produce remarkably similar line-of-sight magnetograms, with
a slope coefficient of $0.97$, an offset below $1$ G, and a Pearson correlation
coefficient of $0.97$. However, SO/PHI-HRT infers weaker line-of-sight fields

SO/PHI-HRT has a closer alignment with the $90$-second HMI vector. In the weak
signal regime ($< 600$ G), SO/PHI-HRT measures stronger and more horizontal
fields than HMI, very likely due to the greater noise in the SO/PHI-HRT data.
In the strong field regime ($\gtrsim 600$ G), HRT infers lower field strengths
but with similar inclinations (a slope of $0.92$) and azimuths (a slope of
$1.02$). The slope values are from the comparison with the HMI $90$-second

mechanism of these sources is still a mystery. The redshift evolutions of the

revealing the origin of the FRBs. However, such estimations rely on the
dispersion measurement (DM)-redshift ($z$) relationship. A few of FRBs detected
recently show large excess DM beyond the expectation from the cosmological and
Milky Way contributions, which indicates large spread of DM from their host
galaxies. In this work, we adopt the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$
model and estimate the energy function using the non-repeating FRBs selected
from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 1.
By comparing the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model to the constant
$\rm DM_{host}$ model, the FRB energy function results are consistent within
the measurement uncertainty. We also estimate the volumetric rate of the
non-repeating FRBs in three different redshift bins. The volumetric rate shows
that the trend is consistent with the stellar-mass density redshift evolution.
Since the lognormal distributed $\rm DM_{host}$ model increases the measurement
errors, the inference of FRBs tracking the stellar-mass density is nonetheless
undermined.

GRAF learns the importance of each neighbor per node (called node-level

weighing each edge according to learned node- and association-level attention,
which results in a fused enriched network. Considering that the fused network
could be a highly dense network with many weak edges depending on the given

Here we report the observation of an even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
state with highly-anisotropic in-plane transport coefficients at Landau level

two-dimensional hole system when a large in-plane magnetic field is applied. By
increasing the in-plane field, we observe a sharp transition from an isotropic
composite fermion Fermi sea to an anisotropic even-denominator FQHS. Our data
and calculations suggest that a unique feature of two-dimensional holes, namely
the coupling between heavy-hole and light-hole states, combines different
orbital components in the wavefunction of one Landau level, and leads to the
emergence of a highly-anisotropic even-denominator fractional quantum Hall
state. Our results demonstrate that the GaAs two-dimensional hole system is a
unique platform for the exploration of exotic, many-body ground states.

of RISs as a new type of network element within the overall wireless
infrastructure. We build a general model for designing control channels along
two dimensions: i) allocated bandwidth (in-band and out-of band) and ii) rate
selection (multiplexing or diversity). Specifically, the second dimension
results in two transmission schemes, one based on channel estimation and the
subsequent adapted RIS configuration, while the other is based on sweeping
through predefined RIS phase profiles. The paper analyzes the performance of
the control channel in multiple communication setups, obtained as combinations
of the aforementioned dimensions. While necessarily simplified, our analysis
reveals the basic trade-offs in designing control channels and the associated
communication algorithms. Perhaps the main value of this work is to serve as a
framework for subsequent design and analysis of various system-level aspects

response or selection mechanism is ignorable (i.e., independent of the response
variable given the features) one can use off-the-shelf regression methods; in
the nonignorable case one typically has to adjust for bias. We observe that
privileged data (i.e. data that is only available during training) might render
a nonignorable selection mechanism ignorable, and we refer to this scenario as
Privilegedly Missing at Random (PMAR). We propose a novel imputation-based
regression method, named repeated regression, that is suitable for PMAR. We
also consider an importance weighted regression method, and a doubly robust
combination of the two. The proposed methods are easy to implement with most
popular out-of-the-box regression algorithms. We empirically assess the
performance of the proposed methods with extensive simulated experiments and on
a synthetically augmented real-world dataset. We conclude that repeated

advantage over weighted regression, especially when extrapolating to regions of

solutions of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this work, we address two of its
major shortcomings: First, we investigate to what extent the computational
burden of stability analysis can be reduced by consistent use of Chebyshev
polynomials. Second, we address the problem of a rigorous error bound, which,
to the authors' knowledge, has been ignored in all engineering applications so
far. Here, we rely on Urabe's error bound and, again, use Chebyshev polynomials
for the computationally involved operations. We use the error estimate to
automatically adjust the harmonic truncation order during numerical
continuation, and confront the algorithm with a state-of-the-art adaptive
Harmonic Balance implementation. Further, we rigorously prove, for the first
time, the existence of some isolated periodic solutions of the forced-damped
Duffing oscillator with softening characteristic. We find that the effort for
obtaining a rigorous error bound, in its present form, may be too high to be
useful for many engineering problems. Based on the results obtained for a
sequence of numerical examples, we conclude that Chebyshev-based stability
analysis indeed permits a substantial speedup. Like Harmonic Balance itself,
however, this method becomes inefficient when an extremely high truncation
order is needed as, e.g., in the presence of (sharply regularized)
discontinuities.

The information used implies an effective entropy reduction of the controlled
system, potentially increasing its performance. How to compute this entropy
reduction has been formally shown for a general system, and has been explicitly
computed for spatially discrete systems. Here, we address a relevant example of
how to compute the entropy reduction by information in a spatially continuous
feedback-controlled system. Specifically, we consider a feedback flashing
ratchet, which constitutes a paradigmatic example for the role of information
and feedback in the dynamics and thermodynamics of transport induced by the
rectification of Brownian motion. A Brownian particle moves in a periodic
potential that is switched on and off by a controller, with the latter
performing the switching depending on the system state. We show how the entropy
reduction can be computed from the entropy of a sequence of control actions,
and also discuss the required sampling effort for its accurate computation.
Moreover, the output power developed by the particle against an external force
is investigated, which -- for some values of the system parameters -- is shown
to become larger than the input power due to the switching of the potential:
the apparent efficiency of the ratchet thus becomes higher than one, if the
entropy reduction contribution is not considered. This result highlights the
relevance of including the entropy reduction by information in the
thermodynamic balance of feedback controlled devices, specifically when writing
the second principle: the inclusion of the entropy reduction by information
leads to a well-behaved efficiency over all the range of parameters
investigated.

electron-ion plasma relevant in binary neutron star merger simulation. We
calculate electrical and thermal conductivities in low density, high
temperature, highly magnetized plasma of binary neutron star mergers where
quantum oscillatory behavior of electrons emerge. For pronounced thermodynamic
effects, we consider zeroth Landau level population of electrons for the
calculation of conductivity. We solve Boltzmann equation in presence of
magnetic field to obtain the dissipative components of electrical and thermal
conductivities. The dissipative coefficients are formulated considering
frequency dependent dynamical screening in the quantized electron-ion
scattering rate. Numerical estimations show that the effect of dynamical
screening of photon propagator on electrical and thermal conductivities is
pronounced. We observe that dynamical screening reduces the maxima of both the
electrical and thermal conductivities by factors of thirty one and twenty
respectively leading to a reduction in the corresponding time scales of these
coefficients. The common scaling factor between electrical and thermal
conductivity is also observed to follow cubic relationship with temperature
violating Wiedemann-Franz law.

user equipment (UE) when it transmits a finite-sized data payload of a given
length. The receiving base station (BS) controls a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS) that can be utilized to improve the channel conditions, but only
if additional pilot signals are transmitted to configure the RIS. The challenge
is that the pilot resources spent on configuring the RIS increase the energy
consumption, especially when small payloads are transmitted, so it must be
balanced against the energy savings during data transmission. We derive a
formula for the energy consumption, taking both the pilot and data transmission
power into account. It also includes the effects of imperfect channel state
information, the use of phase-shifts with finite resolution at the RIS, and the
passive circuit energy consumption.
  We also consider how dividing the RIS into subarrays consisting of multiple
RIS elements using the same reflection coefficient can shorten the pilot
length. In particular, the pilot power and subarray size are tuned to the
payload length to minimize the energy consumption while maintaining parts of
the aperture gain. Our analytical results show that, for a given geometry and
transmission payload length, there exists a unique energy-minimizing subarray
size and pilot power. For small payloads and when the channel conditions
between the BS and UE are favorable compared to the path to the RIS, the energy
consumption is minimized using subarrays with many elements and low pilot
transmission power. On the other hand, when the channel conditions to the RIS
are better and the data payloads are large, it is preferable to use fewer
elements per subarray, potentially configuring each element individually and
transmitting the pilot signals with additional power.

techniques are gradually becoming a mainstream solution for detecting telecom
fraud. However, the graph imbalance problem, caused by the Pareto principle,
brings severe challenges to graph data mining. This is a new and challenging
problem, but little previous work has been noticed. In this paper, we propose a
Graph ATtention network with COst-sensitive BOosting (GAT-COBO) for the graph
imbalance problem. First, we design a GAT-based base classifier to learn the
embeddings of all nodes in the graph. Then, we feed the embeddings into a
well-designed cost-sensitive learner for imbalanced learning. Next, we update
the weights according to the misclassification cost to make the model focus
more on the minority class. Finally, we sum the node embeddings obtained by
multiple cost-sensitive learners to obtain a comprehensive node representation,
which is used for the downstream anomaly detection task. Extensive experiments
on two real-world telecom fraud detection datasets demonstrate that our
proposed method is effective for the graph imbalance problem, outperforming the
state-of-the-art GNNs and GNN-based fraud detectors. In addition, our model is
also helpful for solving the widespread over-smoothing problem in GNNs. The

network analysis has been a popular way to account for unmeasured covariates
that are driving network configurations. Bayesian and EM-type algorithms have
been proposed for inferring the latent space, but both the sheer size many

to encode audio synchronically with video, while considering global temporal

coverage to causal coverage in order to increase the interpretability and
classification performance of the model. First, the concept of causal factor
(CF) is proposed to evaluate the causal correlation between attributes and
decision attributes in the formal decision context. Then, combining CF with
attribute partial order structure, the concept of causal attribute partial
order structure is defined and makes set coverage evolve into causal coverage.
Finally, combined with the idea of three-way decision, 3WCAPOS is formed, which
makes the purity of nodes in the structure clearer and the changes between

classification ability and the interpretability of the structure through the

handling of interactions between a pedestrian and an automated vehicle (AV) in
an unsignalized street crossing scenario. Moreover, a design framework has been
developed, which enables automated parameterization of the decision-making.
This decision-making is designed in such a manner that it can understand
pedestrians in urban traffic and can react accordingly to their intentions.
That way, a human-like response to the actions of the pedestrian is ensured,
leading to a higher acceptance of AVs. The core notion of this paper is that
the intention prediction of the pedestrian to cross the street and
decision-making are divided into two subsystems. On the one hand, the intention
detection is a data-driven, black-box model. Thus, it can model the complex
behavior of the pedestrians. On the other hand, the decision-making is a
white-box model to ensure traceability and to enable a rapid verification and
validation of AVs. This white-box decision-making provides human-like behavior
and a guaranteed prevention of deadlocks. An additional benefit is that the
proposed decision-making requires low computational resources only enabling
real world usage. The automated parameterization uses a particle swarm
optimization and compares two different models of the pedestrian: The social
force model and the Markov decision process model. Consequently, a rapid design
of the decision-making is possible and different pedestrian behaviors can be
taken into account. The results reinforce the applicability of the proposed

probabilistic forecasts. Conventional post-processing methods operate by
estimating the parameters of a parametric distribution, frequently on a
per-location or per-lead-time basis. We propose a novel, neural network-based
method, which produces forecasts for all locations and lead times, jointly. To
relax the distributional assumption of many post-processing methods, our
approach incorporates normalizing flows as flexible parametric distribution
estimators. This enables us to model varying forecast distributions in a
mathematically exact way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the
context of the EUPPBench benchmark, where we conduct temperature forecast
post-processing for stations in a sub-region of western Europe. We show that
our novel method exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark,
outclassing our previous, well-performing entry. Additionally, by providing a
detailed comparison of three variants of our novel post-processing method, we
elucidate the reasons why our method outperforms per-lead-time-based approaches
and approaches with distributional assumptions.

classification related tasks. In the untargeted attacks on graph structure, the
gradients derived from the attack objective are the attacker's basis for
evaluating a perturbation scheme. Previous methods use negative cross-entropy
loss as the attack objective in attacking node-level classification models.
However, the suitability of the cross-entropy function for constructing the
untargeted attack objective has yet been discussed in previous works. This
paper argues about the previous unreasonable attack objective from the
perspective of budget allocation. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that negative cross-entropy tends to produce more significant gradients from
nodes with lower confidence in the labeled classes, even if the predicted
classes of these nodes have been misled. To free up these inefficient attack
budgets, we propose a simple attack model for untargeted attacks on graph
structure based on a novel attack objective which generates unweighted
gradients on graph structures that are not affected by the node confidence. By
conducting experiments in gray-box poisoning attack scenarios, we demonstrate
that a reasonable budget allocation can significantly improve the effectiveness
of gradient-based edge perturbations without any extra hyper-parameter.

the SAR community is effective sweep width (W), which provides a single measure
for a search asset's ability to detect a specific object in specific
environmental conditions. Tables of W for different search assets are provided

In vitro, no cytotoxic effect is detected on C2C12 murine myoblasts, while

three variables: the correct and the corrupted geometries and the property.
GeoTMI also explicitly updates the corrupted input to approach the correct
geometry as it passes through the GNN layers, contributing to more effective
denoising. We investigated the performance of the proposed method using 3D GNNs
for three prediction tasks: molecular properties, a chemical reaction property,
and relaxed energy in a heterogeneous catalytic system. Our results showed
consistent improvements in accuracy across various tasks, demonstrating the

Multi-fidelity methods use a small set of high-fidelity data to enhance the

paper, this is accomplished by constructing a graph Laplacian using the
low-fidelity data and computing its low-lying spectrum. This spectrum is then
used to cluster the data and identify points that are closest to the centroids
of the clusters. High-fidelity data is then acquired for these key points.
Thereafter, a transformation that maps every low-fidelity data point to its

bi- and high-fidelity data at the key points, and to preserve the underlying
structure of the low-fidelity data distribution. The latter objective is

effect of magnetic ions, they should be incorporated into the crystal lattice
of 2D material rather than form separated precipitates. This work shows a study
on incorporating magnetic manganese ions into the MoSe$_2$ monolayers using
molecular beam epitaxy. We test growth on various substrates with very
different properties: polycrystalline SiO$_2$ on Si, exfoliated 2D hexagonal
Boron Nitride flakes (placed on SiO$_2$ / Si), monocrystalline sapphire, and
exfoliated graphite (on tantalum foil). Although atomic force microscopy images
indicate the presence of MnSe precipitates, but at the same time, various
techniques reveal effects related to alloying MoSe$_2$ with Mn: Raman
scattering and photoluminescence measurements show energy shift related to the
presence of Mn, scanning transmission microscopy shows Mn induced partial
transformation of 1H to 1T^\prime phase. Above effects evidence partial
incorporation of Mn into the MoSe$_2$ layer.

raised questions about the potential consciousness of these tools and the
extent of their general artificial intelligence. ChatGPT consistent avoidance
of passing the test is here overcome by asking ChatGPT to apply the Turing test
to itself. This explores the possibility of the model recognizing its own
sentience. In its own eyes, it passes this test. ChatGPT's self-assessment
makes serious implications about our understanding of the Turing test and the
nature of consciousness. This investigation concludes by considering the
existence of distinct types of consciousness and the possibility that the
Turing test is only effective when applied between consciousnesses of the same
kind. This study also raises intriguing questions about the nature of AI
consciousness and the validity of the Turing test as a means of verifying such
consciousness.

SmallSat has amplified public involvement in orbital research. This allows for
flexible and efficient deployments of impactful low-earth-orbit experiments
that would otherwise never be flown. However, the launch industry responsible
for flying these experiments is not flexible nor efficient. This project aims
to make orbital technologies accessible at the miniature scale, specifically
thrust-vector-control, through an iterative engineering process simplifying and
miniaturizing technologies from launch vehicles such as the Space Shuttle and
Falcon 9. An Arduino-based custom flight computer was developed alongside state
machine control software and active-control hardware, all designed to scale.
Together, these three major components emulate the methods used in the
aerospace industry. Initial test flights and recent ground test data have
indicated stable control with a maximum of 7{\deg} and 2.62{\deg} of deviation
from the intended flight path respectively, an acceptable stability range when
compared to similar finned flights. Results show that scalable thrust vectoring
is possible at a small scale, giving adaptability and control applicable to
both small and large test vehicles. With accessible orbital flight, countless
experiments can be completed concurrently, allowing for faster amateur rocket
development and opening another path to space.

feed-forward and backward process, during the training to learn model weights,
of an artificial neural network (ANN). Inspired from the idea of the two-step
rule for backpropagation, we define a notion of F-adjoint which is aimed at a
better description of the backpropagation algorithm. In particular, by
introducing the notions of F-propagation and F-adjoint through a deep neural
network architecture, the backpropagation associated to a cost/loss function is
proven to be completely characterized by the F-adjoint of the corresponding
F-propagation relatively to the partial derivative, with respect to the inputs,
of the cost function.

method. The method uses expected values of finite differences of the underlying

using the important directions on a lower dimensional subspace. The method is a
generalization of the active subspace method which uses the gradient
information of the function to construct a reduced model. We develop the error
analysis for the global active subspace method, and present examples to compare
it with the active subspace method numerically. The results show that the
global active subspace method is accurate, efficient, and robust with respect

compelling properties for the integration of radial integrands encountered in
electronic structure, but thus far has only been computed up to N = 50, with
some nontrivial holes in the existing tables for 27 <= N < 50. In this work, a
simple recipe is developed to compute the MultiExp Gaussian quadrature for
larger N at close to the double precision machine epsilon. Notably, this recipe
uses only double precision operations, so no computer algebra systems or
arbitrary precision libraries are needed. There are three primary outcomes: (A)
The MultiExp tables for all N <= 1000 are presented in a supplement to this
report - these might prove useful in building better medium and high quality
density functional theory quadrature grids (B) these tables are compared to the
known Gill and Chien tables with excellent agreement obtained modulo a
noticeable problem with the weights of the largest N = 50 Gill and Chien table
and (C) it may be the case that the Boley-Golub plus extremely high-order
Gauss-Legendre quadrature approximation recipe developed in this work could be
used to automatically derive other quadrature rules throughout electronic
structure theory and beyond.

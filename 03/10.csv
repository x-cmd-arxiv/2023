central topic in graph theory. An old and well known conjecture in the area
states that any $d$-regular $n$-vertex graph $G$ whose second largest
eigenvalue in absolute value $\lambda(G)$ is at most $\frac{d}{C}$, for some
universal constant $C>0$, has a Hamilton cycle. In this paper, we obtain two
main results which make substantial progress towards this problem. Firstly, we
settle this conjecture in full when the degree $d$ is at least a small power of
$n$. Secondly, in the general case we show that $\lambda(G) \leq
\frac{d}{C(\log n)^{1/3}}$ implies the existence of a Hamilton cycle, improving
the 20-year old bound of $\frac{d}{ \log^{1-o(1)} n}$ of Krivelevich and
Sudakov. We use in a novel way a variety of methods, such as a robust P\'osa
rotation-extension technique, the Friedman-Pippenger tree embedding with
rollbacks and the absorbing method, combined with additional tools and ideas.
  Our results have several interesting applications, giving best bounds on the
number of generators which guarantee the Hamiltonicity of random Cayley graphs,
which is an important partial case of the well known Hamiltonicity conjecture
of Lov\'asz. They can also be used to improve a result of Alon and Bourgain on
additive patterns in multiplicative subgroups.

with two invited talk by Thierry Dana-Picard (Jerusalem College of Technology,
Jerusalem, Israel) and Yoni Zohar (Bar Ilan University, Tel Aviv, Israel) and
four contributions. An open call for papers was then issued, and attracted
seven submissions. Those submissions have been accepted by our reviewers, who
jointly produced at least three careful reports on each of the contributions.
The resulting revised papers are collected in the present volume. The
contributions in this volume are a faithful representation of the wide spectrum
of ThEdu, ranging from those more focused on the automated deduction research,
not losing track of the possible applications in an educational setting, to
those focused on the applications, in educational settings, of automated
deduction tools and methods. We, the volume editors, hope that this collection
of papers will further promote the development of theorem-proving based
software, and that it will allow to improve the mutual understanding between
computer scientists, mathematicians and stakeholders in education. While this
volume goes to press, the next edition of the ThEdu workshop is being prepared:

  Perturbation Approximation",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Balanced Singular Perturbation Approximation (SPA) is a model order reduction
method for linear time-invariant systems that guarantees asymptotic stability
and for which there exists an a priori error bound. In that respect, it is
similar to Balanced Truncation (BT). However, the reduced models obtained by
SPA generally introduce better approximation in the lower frequency range and
near steady-states, whereas BT is better suited for the higher frequency range.
Even so, independently of the frequency range of interest, BT and its variants
are more often applied in practice, since there exist more efficient
algorithmic realizations thereof. In this paper, we aim at closing this
practically-relevant gap for SPA. We propose two novel and efficient algorithms
that are adapted for different settings. Firstly, we derive a low-rank
implementation of SPA that is applicable in the large-scale setting. Secondly,
a data-driven reinterpretation of the method is proposed that only requires
input-output data, and thus, is realization-free. A main tool for our
derivations is the reciprocal transformation, which induces a distinct view on
implementing the method. While the reciprocal transformation and the
characterization of SPA is not new, its significance for the practical
algorithmic realization has been overlooked in the literature. Our proposed
algorithms have well-established counterparts for BT, and as such, also a
comparable computational complexity. The numerical performance of the two novel
implementations is tested for several numerical benchmarks, and comparisons to
their counterparts for BT as well as the existing implementations of SPA are
made.

represent a paradigm shift in materials science because they greatly improve
nanoparticle dispersion and offer greater tunability over rheological and
mechanical properties in comparison to neat polymers. Utilizing the full
potential of PGNs requires a deeper understanding of how polymer graft length,
density, and chemistry influence interfacial interactions between particles.
There has been great progress in describing these effects with molecular
dynamics (MD). However, the limitations of the length and time scales of MD
make it prohibitively costly to study systems involving more than a few PGNs.
Here, we address some of these challenges by proposing a new modeling paradigm
for PGNs using a strain-energy mapping framework involving potential of mean
force (PMF) calculations. In this approach, each nanoparticle is coarse-grained
into a representative particle with chains treated implicitly, namely, the
implicit chain particle model (ICPM). Using a chemistry-specific CG-MD model of
PMMA as a testbed, we derive the effective interaction between particles
arranged in a closed-packed lattice configuration by matching bulk
dilation/compression strain energy densities. The strain-rate dependence of the
mechanical work in ICPM is also discussed. Overall, the ICPM model increases
the computational speed by approximately 5-6 orders of magnitude compared to
the CG-MD models. This novel framework is foundational for particle-based
simulations of PGNs and their blends and accelerates the understanding and
predictions of emergent properties of PGN materials.

respect to these frames. The laws are postulated to be gauge invariant under
local Poincar\'e transformations. This implies the existence of 4 translational
gauge potentials ${e}^\alpha$ (``gravitons"") and 6 Lorentz gauge potentials
${\Gamma}^{\alpha\beta}$ (``rotons"") and the coupling of the momentum current

one is led to a Riemann-Cartan spacetime carrying torsion and curvature, richer
in structure than the spacetime of general relativity. The Riemann-Cartan
spacetime is controlled by the two general gauge field equations (3.44) and
(3.45), in which material momentum and spin act as sources. The general
framework of the theory is summarized in a table in Section 3.6. -- Options for
picking a gauge field lagrangian are discussed (teleparallelism, ECSK). We

substantially pushed the boundary of code generation and achieved impressive
performance. Despite their great power, the huge number of model parameters
poses a significant threat to adapting them in a regular software development
environment, where a developer might use a standard laptop or mid-size server
to develop her code. Such large models incur significant resource usage (in
terms of memory, latency, and dollars) as well as carbon footprint.
  Model compression is a promising approach to address these challenges.
Several techniques are proposed to compress large pretrained models typically
used for vision or textual data. Out of many available compression techniques,
we identified that quantization is mostly applicable for code generation task
as it does not require significant retraining cost. As quantization represents
model parameters with lower-bit integer (e.g., int8), the model size and
runtime latency would both benefit from such int representation. We extensively
study the impact of quantized model on code generation tasks across different
dimension: (i) resource usage and carbon footprint, (ii) accuracy, and (iii)
robustness. To this end, through systematic experiments we find a recipe of
quantization technique that could run even a $6$B model in a regular laptop
without significant accuracy or robustness degradation. We further found the
recipe is readily applicable to code summarization task as well.

expected if they form in a flat but tilted circumbinary gas disc and decouple
from the disc within a time difference that is much less than the disc nodal
precession period. We constrain the parameters of stable multiple planet
circumbinary systems. Both planet-planet and planet-binary interactions can
cause complex planet tilt oscillations which can destabilise the orbits of one
or both planets. The system is considerably more unstable than the effects of
these individual interactions would suggest, due to the interplay between these
two interactions. The stability of the system is sensitive to the binary
eccentricity, the orbital tilt and the semi-major axes of the two circumbinary
planets. With an inner planet semi-major axis of $5\,a_{\rm b}$, where $a_{\rm
b}$ is semi-major axis of the binary, the system is generally stable if the
outer planet is located at $\gtrsim 8\,a_{\rm b}$, beyond the 2:1 mean motion
resonance with the inner planet. For larger inner planet semi-major axis the
system is less stable because the von-Zeipel--Kozai--Lidov mechanism plays a
significant role, particularly for low binary-eccentricity cases. For the
unstable cases, the most likely outcome is that one planet is ejected and the
other remains bound on a highly eccentric orbit. Therefore we suggest that this
instability is an efficient mechanism for producing free-floating planets.

regularizing imaging inverse problems. Most work in the area has focused on
regularization imposed implicitly by convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

line of work based on learning explicit regularization functionals that promote
preferred solutions. We develop the Explicit Learned Deep Equilibrium
Regularizer (ELDER) method for learning explicit regularizers that minimize a
mean-squared error (MSE) metric. ELDER is based on a regularization functional
parameterized by a CNN and a deep equilibrium learning (DEQ) method for
training the functional to be MSE-optimal at the fixed points of the
reconstruction algorithm. The explicit regularizer enables ELDER to directly
inherit fundamental convergence results from optimization theory. On the other
hand, DEQ training enables ELDER to improve over existing explicit regularizers
without prohibitive memory complexity during training. We use ELDER to train
several approaches to parameterizing explicit regularizers and test their
performance on three distinct imaging inverse problems. Our results show that
ELDER can greatly improve the quality of explicit regularizers compared to
existing methods, and show that learning explicit regularizers does not
compromise performance relative to methods based on implicit regularization.

about potential future movements of the object being pushed, such as a
strawberry stem, using a robot tactile finger. The model is integrated into a
Deep Functional Predictive Control (d-FPC) system to control the displacement
of the stem on the tactile finger during pushes. Pushing an object with a robot
finger along a desired trajectory in 3D is a highly nonlinear and complex
physical robot interaction, especially when the object is not stably grasped.
The proposed approach controls the stem movements on the tactile finger in a
prediction horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed FPC is demonstrated in a
series of tests involving a real robot pushing a strawberry in a cluster. The
results indicate that the d-FPC controller can successfully control PRI in
robotic manipulation tasks beyond the handling of strawberries. The proposed
approach offers a promising direction for addressing the challenging PRI

the lower atmosphere and gives rise to bright soft X-ray post-flare loops and
flare ribbons that reproduce the morphology and dynamic evolution of observed
flares. The model helps to shed light on questions of where and when the a flux

tackle the nonconvexity, we develop a notion of strong prox-regularity which is
related to the singleton property, Lipschitz continuity, and monotonicity of
the associated proximal operator, and we verify it in various classes of
functions, including weakly convex functions, indicator functions of proximally
smooth sets, and two specific sphere-related nonconvex nonsmooth functions. In
this case, the problem class we are concerned with covers smooth optimization
problems on manifold and certain composite optimization problems on manifold.
For the latter, the proposed algorithm is the first second-order type method.
Combining with the semismoothness of the proximal operator, we design a
projected semismooth Newton method to find a root of the natural residual
induced by the proximal gradient method. Since the corresponding natural
residual may not be globally monotone, an extra projection is added on the
usual semismooth Newton step and new criteria are proposed for the switching
between the projected semismooth Newton step and the proximal step. The global
convergence is then established under the strong prox-regularity. Based on the
BD regularity condition, we establish local superlinear convergence. Numerical
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared with

conservative in their assumptions, causing higher-than-necessary costs, or
leave the system vulnerable to low probability, high impact uncertainty

guarantee system security, and ""adverse operation"", in which the system
operator is required to take additional actions, e.g., manual reserve

chance-constrained problem, which enforces that AGC should be sufficient with a
high probability, with specific treatment of large-disturbance scenarios that
allows for additional, more complex redispatch actions. The new formulation has
been compared with the classical ones in a case study on the IEEE-118 bus

solutions that are more secure than typical chance-constrained formulations,

animation generation method that allows to capture personalized and subtle cues
in speech (e.g. identity, emotion and hesitation). It is also very robust to
background noise and can handle audio recorded in a variety of situations (e.g.
multiple people speaking). Recent approaches employ end-to-end deep learning
taking into account both audio and text as input to generate facial animation
for the whole face. However, scarcity of publicly available expressive audio-3D
facial animation datasets poses a major bottleneck. The resulting animations
still have issues regarding accurate lip-synching, expressivity,
person-specific information and generalizability. We effectively employ
self-supervised pretrained HuBERT model in the training process that allows us
to incorporate both lexical and non-lexical information in the audio without
using a large lexicon. Additionally, guiding the training with a binary emotion
condition and speaker identity distinguishes the tiniest subtle facial motion.
We carried out extensive objective and subjective evaluation in comparison to
ground-truth and state-of-the-art work. A perceptual user study demonstrates
that our approach produces superior results with respect to the realism of the
animation 78% of the time in comparison to the state-of-the-art. In addition,
our method is 4 times faster eliminating the use of complex sequential models
such as transformers. We strongly recommend watching the supplementary video

bundle. There are many interesting examples and applications of tangent
categories in a variety of areas such as differential geometry, algebraic
geometry, algebra, and even computer science. The purpose of this paper is to
expand the theory of tangent categories in a new direction: the theory of
operads. The main result of this paper is that both the category of algebras of
an operad and its opposite category are tangent categories. The tangent bundle
for the category of algebras is given by the semi-direct product, while the
tangent bundle for the opposite category of algebras is constructed using the
module of K\""ahler differentials, and these tangent bundles are in fact
adjoints of one another. To prove these results, we first prove that the
category of algebras of a coCartesian differential monad is a tangent category.
We then show that the monad associated to any operad is a coCartesian
differential monad. This also implies that we can construct Cartesian
differential categories from operads. Therefore, operads provide a bountiful
source of examples of tangent categories and Cartesian differential categories,
which both recaptures previously known examples and also yield new interesting
examples. We also discuss how certain basic tangent category notions recapture
well-known concepts in the theory of operads.

  In this paper we give a combinatorial description of the rank of a sparse

show that the rank of a sparse random graph is extremely well-approximated by

characterized by a Bayesian marginal likelihood. In this work, we show how to
carefully interpolate this marginal likelihood between choices of binary
evolution model parameters, enabling the analysis of their posterior
distributions between expensive binary evolution simulations. Using the
StarTrack binary evolution code, we compare one- and four-dimensional binary
evolution models to the compact binary mergers reported in recent
gravitational-wave observing runs, considering merger detection rates and mass
distributions. We demonstrate that the predicted detection rates and mass
distribution of simulated binaries are effective in constraining binary
evolution formation. We first consider a one-dimensional model, studying the
effect of SuperNova (SN) kick velocity ($\sigma_{eff}$) and follow this up with
a four-dimensional study of $\sigma_{eff}$, mass transfer efficiency ($f_a$)
and angular momentum ejection ($\beta$) during Roche-lobe accretion, and an
observation-driven reduction in the mass-loss rate from stellar wind

magnetic nanoparticles with high temporal resolution. As a quantitative tracer
based imaging method, the signal is linear in the tracer concentration for any
location that contains nanoparticles and zero in the surrounding tissue which
does not provide any intrinsic signal. After tracer injection, the
concentration over time (positive contrast) can be utilized to calculate
dynamic diagnostic parameters like perfusion parameters in vessels and organs,
which are an important tool in medical diagnosis. Every acquired perfusion
image thus requires a new bolus of tracer with a sufficiently large iron dose
to be visible above the background. We propose a method, where a bolus of
physiological saline solution without any particles (negative contrast)
displaces the remaining steady state concentration which in turn contributes to
the image contrast. Perfusion parameters are calculated based on the time
response of this negative bolus and compared to a positive bolus. Results from
phantom experiments show that normalized signals from positive and negative
boli are concurrent and deviations of calculated perfusion maps are low. Our
method opens up the possibility to increase the total monitoring time of a

minimizing the iron dose per acquired image.

the central area of the cloud is actively forming protostars and is moderately

mass-segregation in the cloud, with a degree of mass-segregation

of helicity-dependent optical control of fully-compensated antiferromagnetic

tasks, and are set to reach a growing audience in coming years due to
integration in product interfaces like ChatGPT or search engines like Bing.
This intensifies the need to ensure that models are aligned with human
preferences and do not produce unsafe, inaccurate or toxic outputs. While
alignment techniques like reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) and
red-teaming can mitigate some safety concerns and improve model capabilities,
it is unlikely that an aggregate fine-tuning process can adequately represent
the full range of users' preferences and values. Different people may
legitimately disagree on their preferences for language and conversational
norms, as well as on values or ideologies which guide their communication.
Personalising LLMs through micro-level preference learning processes may result
in models that are better aligned with each user. However, there are several
normative challenges in defining the bounds of a societally-acceptable and safe
degree of personalisation. In this paper, we ask how, and in what ways, LLMs
should be personalised. First, we review literature on current paradigms for
aligning LLMs with human feedback, and identify issues including (i) a lack of
clarity regarding what alignment means; (ii) a tendency of technology providers
to prescribe definitions of inherently subjective preferences and values; and
(iii) a 'tyranny of the crowdworker', exacerbated by a lack of documentation in
who we are really aligning to. Second, we present a taxonomy of benefits and
risks associated with personalised LLMs, for individuals and society at large.
Finally, we propose a three-tiered policy framework that allows users to
experience the benefits of personalised alignment, while restraining unsafe and
undesirable LLM-behaviours within (supra-)national and organisational bounds.

For instance, in the stock market, instantaneous dependence can exist between
two stocks because the fluctuation of one stock can quickly affect the other

paper, we prove that with few exceptions, ignoring instantaneous dependence can
result in suboptimal policy learning in MBRL. To address the suboptimality

model of conducting charged liquid drops by incorporating the discreteness of
the elementary charges. Introducing the model that describes two immiscible
fluids with the same dielectric constant, with a drop of one fluid containing a
fixed number of elementary charges together with their solvation spheres, we
interpret the equilibrium shape of the drop as a global minimizer of the sum of
its surface energy and the electrostatic repulsive energy between the charges
under fixed drop volume. For all model parameters, we establish existence of
generalized minimizers that consist of at most a finite number of components
``at infinity''. We also give several existence and non-existence results for
classical minimizers consisting of only a single component. In particular, we
identify an asymptotically sharp threshold for the number of charges to yield
existence of minimizers in a regime corresponding to macroscopically large
drops containing a large number of charges. The obtained non-trivial threshold
is significantly below the corresponding threshold for the Rayleigh model,
consistently with the ill-posedness of the latter and demonstrating a
particular regularizing effect of the charge discreteness. However, when a

anomalous events or behaviors by examining human pose extracted from the video
frames. Utilizing pose data alleviates privacy and ethical issues. Also,
computation-wise, the complexity of pose-based models is lower than pixel-based
approaches. However, it introduces more challenges, such as noisy skeleton
data, losing important pixel information, and not having enriched enough
features. These problems are exacerbated by a lack of anomaly detection
datasets that are good enough representatives of real-world scenarios. In this
work, we analyze and quantify the characteristics of two well-known video
anomaly datasets to better understand the difficulties of pose-based anomaly
detection. We take a step forward, exploring the discriminating power of pose
and trajectory for video anomaly detection and their effectiveness based on
context. We believe these experiments are beneficial for a better comprehension
of pose-based anomaly detection and the datasets currently available. This will
aid researchers in tackling the task of anomaly detection with a more lucid

models that relate these unknown quantities to measured MRI signals. Estimating
these unknowns, which has traditionally required model fitting - an often

approaches. Such parameter estimation may be complicated by intrinsic qMRI
signal model degeneracy: different combinations of tissue properties produce
the same signal. Despite their many advantages, it remains unclear whether ML
approaches can resolve this issue. Growing empirical evidence appears to
suggest ML approaches remain susceptible to model degeneracy. Here we
demonstrate under the right circumstances ML can address this issue. Inspired
by recent works on the impact of training data distributions on ML-based
parameter estimation, we propose to resolve model degeneracy by designing
training data distributions. We put forward a classification of model
degeneracies and identify one particular kind of degeneracies amenable to the
proposed attack. The strategy is demonstrated successfully using the Revised

results illustrate the importance of training set design which has the

  Mimicking","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have been popular paradigms for large-scale vision
representation pre-training. However, MAE solely reconstructs the low-level RGB
signals after the decoder and lacks supervision upon high-level semantics for
the encoder, thus suffering from sub-optimal learned representations and long
pre-training epochs. To alleviate this, previous methods simply replace the
pixel reconstruction targets of 75% masked tokens by encoded features from
pre-trained image-image (DINO) or image-language (CLIP) contrastive learning.
Different from those efforts, we propose to Mimic before Reconstruct for Masked
Autoencoders, named as MR-MAE, which jointly learns high-level and low-level
representations without interference during pre-training. For high-level
semantics, MR-MAE employs a mimic loss over 25% visible tokens from the encoder
to capture the pre-trained patterns encoded in CLIP and DINO. For low-level
structures, we inherit the reconstruction loss in MAE to predict RGB pixel
values for 75% masked tokens after the decoder. As MR-MAE applies high-level
and low-level targets respectively at different partitions, the learning
conflicts between them can be naturally overcome and contribute to superior
visual representations for various downstream tasks. On ImageNet-1K, the MR-MAE
base pre-trained for only 400 epochs achieves 85.8% top-1 accuracy after
fine-tuning, surpassing the 1600-epoch MAE base by +2.2% and the previous
state-of-the-art BEiT V2 base by +0.3%. Code and pre-trained models will be

existing offline RL methods tend to exhibit poor online fine-tuning
performance. On the other hand, online RL methods can learn effectively through
online interaction, but struggle to incorporate offline data, which can make
them very slow in settings where exploration is challenging or pre-training is
necessary. In this paper, we devise an approach for learning an effective
initialization from offline data that also enables fast online fine-tuning
capabilities. Our approach, calibrated Q-learning (Cal-QL) accomplishes this by
learning a conservative value function initialization that underestimates the
value of the learned policy from offline data, while also being calibrated, in
the sense that the learned Q-values are at a reasonable scale. We refer to this
property as calibration, and define it formally as providing a lower bound on
the true value function of the learned policy and an upper bound on the value
of some other (suboptimal) reference policy, which may simply be the behavior
policy. We show that offline RL algorithms that learn such calibrated value
functions lead to effective online fine-tuning, enabling us to take the
benefits of offline initializations in online fine-tuning. In practice, Cal-QL
can be implemented on top of existing conservative methods for offline RL
within a one-line code change. Empirically, Cal-QL outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on 10/11 fine-tuning benchmark tasks that we study in this paper.

robot deployments. In the case of legged mobile manipulators, the robot arm
could adaptively stop the fall and assist the recovery. Prior works on falling

assumptions such as inelastic collisions and falling in defined directions to
enable real-time computation. This paper presents a learning-based approach to
reducing fall damage and recovery. An asymmetric actor-critic training
structure is used to train a time-invariant policy with time-varying reward
functions. In simulated experiments, the policy recovers from 98.9\% of initial
falling configurations. It reduces base contact impulse, peak joint internal
forces, and base acceleration during the fall compared to the baseline methods.
The trained control policy is deployed and extensively tested on the ALMA robot

  Chaotic Time Series Prediction","12 pages, 10 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has been strongly emerging as a time series
prediction approach in quantum machine learning (QML). This work is the first
to apply optimization to resource noise in a quantum reservoir to effectively
improve time series prediction. Based on this development, we propose a new
approach to quantum circuit optimization.
  We build on the work of Suzuki et al., who used quantum hardware noise as an
essential resource in quantum noise-induced reservoir (QNIR) computer for
generating non-trivial output sequences, and we achieve a novel, optimized
QNIR, in which the artificial noise channels are parameterized. To optimize the
parameterized resource noise, we use dual annealing and evolutionary
optimization. Another essential component of our approach is reducing quantum
resources in the number of artificial noise models, number of qubits,
entanglement scheme complexity, and circuit depth. A key result is the
reduction from a general multi-component noise model to a single reset noise
model.
  Reservoir computers are especially well-suited for modelling nonlinear
dynamical systems. In this paper we consider NARMA and Mackey-Glass systems,
which are common univariate time series benchmarks for reservoir computers and
recurrent neural networks. Recently QRCs have demonstrated good prediction
capability with small numbers of qubits. QNIR simulations based on our
optimization approach demonstrate high performance on NARMA benchmarks while
using only a 12-qubit reservoir and a single noise model. Good prediction
performances over 100 timesteps ahead for the Mackey-Glass system are
demonstrated in the chaotic regime. In addition, these results provide valuable
insight into resource noise requirements for the QNIR.

production. However, for this resonant production to work in an expanding
universe, a large axion-dark photon coupling is required, which is not easy to
realize in terms of model building and requires the introduction of many
charged fermions and/or the complex clockwork mechanism. In this paper, we
present a new scenario that efficiently produces dark photons from the axion
with a much smaller coupling. This is possible by modifying the dynamics of
axion and significantly delaying the onset of oscillations, as in the so-called
trapped misalignment mechanism. As a specific example, we consider models in
which dark photon production occurs efficiently despite the small axion-dark
photon coupling by temporally trapping an axion in a wrong minimum and
releasing it after the Hubble parameter becomes much smaller than the axion
mass. In this scenario, it is expected that the polarization asymmetry of dark
photons and gravitational waves generated from dark photons will be
significantly reduced.

models, we formally show that Kontsevich's star product can be obtained from
the twisted convolution algebra of the geometric quantization of a Lie
2-groupoid, one which integrates the Poisson structure. We show that there is
an analogue of the Poisson sigma model which is valued in Lie 1-groupoids and
which can often be defined non-perturbatively; it can be obtained by symplectic
reduction using the quantization of the Lie 2-groupoid. We call these
groupoid-valued sigma models and we argue that, when they exist, they can be
used to compute correlation functions of gauge invariant observables. This
leads to a (possibly non-associative) product on the underlying space of
functions on the Poisson manifold, and in several examples we show that we
recover strict deformation quantizations, in the sense of Rieffel. Even in the
cases when our construction leads to a non-associative product we still obtain
a $C^*$-algebra and a ""quantization"" map. In particular, we construct
noncommutative $C^*$-algebras equipped with an $SU(2)$-action, together with an

and investigate core convection and internal gravity waves in the core-envelope

luminosities establish scaling relations to constrain models of mixing for 1D
applications. As in previous works, the turbulent mass entrainment rate
extrapolated to nominal heating is unrealistically high ($1.58\times 10^{-4}\
\mathrm{M_\odot/yr}$), which is discussed in terms of the non-equilibrium
response of the simulations to the initial stratification. We measure
quantitatively the effect of mixing due to internal gravity waves excited by
core convection interacting with the boundary in our simulations. The wave
power spectral density as a function of frequency and wavelength agrees well
with the GYRE eigenmode predictions based on the 1D spherically averaged radial
profile. A diffusion coefficient profile that reproduces the spherically
averaged abundance distribution evolution is determined for each simulation.
Through a combination of eigenmode analysis and scaling relations it is shown
that in the $N^2$-peak region, mixing is due to internal gravity waves and
follows the scaling relation $D_\mathrm{IGW-hydro} \propto L^{4/3}$ over a
$\gtrapprox 2\ \mathrm{dex}$ range of heating factors. Different extrapolations
of the mixing efficiency down to nominal heating are discussed. If internal
gravity wave mixing is due to thermally-enhanced shear mixing, an upper limit
is $D_\mathrm{IGW} \lessapprox 2$ to $3\times 10^4\ \mathrm{cm^2/s}$ at nominal
heating in the $N^2$-peak region above the convective core.

to quantify acute brain dysfunction status including coma, delirium, normal, or
death at 12-hour intervals of each ICU admission and to identify acute brain
dysfunction phenotypes using continuous acute brain dysfunction status and
k-means clustering approach. There were 49,770 admissions for 37,835 patients
in UFH GNV dataset and 18,472 admissions for 10,982 patients in UFH JAX
dataset. In total, 18% of patients had coma as the worst brain dysfunction
status; every 12 hours, around 4%-7% would transit to delirium, 22%-25% would
recover, 3%-4% would expire, and 67%-68% would remain in a coma in the ICU.
Additionally, 7% of patients had delirium as the worst brain dysfunction
status; around 6%-7% would transit to coma, 40%-42% would be no delirium, 1%
would expire, and 51%-52% would remain delirium in the ICU. There were three
phenotypes: persistent coma/delirium, persistently normal, and transition from
coma/delirium to normal almost exclusively in first 48 hours after ICU
admission. We developed phenotyping scoring algorithms that determined acute
brain dysfunction status every 12 hours while admitted to the ICU. This
approach may be useful in developing prognostic and decision-support tools to
aid patients and clinicians in decision-making on resource use and escalation
of care.

yet a panacea for structured tabular data. In the tabular domain, their
efficiency crucially relies on various forms of regularization to prevent
overfitting and provide strong generalization performance. Existing
regularization techniques include broad modelling decisions such as choice of
architecture, loss functions, and optimization methods. In this work, we
introduce Tabular Neural Gradient Orthogonalization and Specialization
(TANGOS), a novel framework for regularization in the tabular setting built on
latent unit attributions. The gradient attribution of an activation with
respect to a given input feature suggests how the neuron attends to that
feature, and is often employed to interpret the predictions of deep networks.
In TANGOS, we take a different approach and incorporate neuron attributions
directly into training to encourage orthogonalization and specialization of
latent attributions in a fully-connected network. Our regularizer encourages
neurons to focus on sparse, non-overlapping input features and results in a set
of diverse and specialized latent units. In the tabular domain, we demonstrate
that our approach can lead to improved out-of-sample generalization
performance, outperforming other popular regularization methods. We provide
insight into why our regularizer is effective and demonstrate that TANGOS can
be applied jointly with existing methods to achieve even greater generalization
performance.

therefore make more informed decisions and generate tokens that will eventually

objectives and corresponding reinforcement-learning algorithms beyond the
classic cumulative rewards, such as objectives specified as linear temporal
logic formulas. However, questions about the PAC-learnability of these new
objectives have remained open.
  This work demonstrates the PAC-learnability of general reinforcement-learning
objectives through sufficient conditions for PAC-learnability in two analysis
settings. In particular, for the analysis that considers only sample
complexity, we prove that if an objective given as an oracle is uniformly
continuous, then it is PAC-learnable. Further, for the analysis that considers
computational complexity, we prove that if an objective is computable, then it
is PAC-learnable. In other words, if a procedure computes successive
approximations of the objective's value, then the objective is PAC-learnable.
  We give three applications of our condition on objectives from the literature
with previously unknown PAC-learnability and prove that these objectives are
PAC-learnable. Overall, our result helps verify existing objectives'
PAC-learnability. Also, as some studied objectives that are not uniformly

outside of the detectability band of the LISA mission. We find, however, that
the final stages of common-envelope interactions leading to mergers of the
stellar cores fall into the frequency band in which the sensitivity of LISA
peaks, making them promising candidates for detection. These detections can
constrain the enigmatic common-envelope dynamics. Furthermore, future decihertz

that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to

echo in their mid-infrared colors, a sign of significant dust in the nucleus.
The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are consistent
with TDE hosts, and both populations reside within the green valley. The
blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot

that the Roche potential sets up a nozzle converging on the inner Lagrangian
point and that the gas flows mostly along the axis connecting both stars. We
derive a set of 1D hydrodynamic equations governing the gas flow with
$\dot{M}_\text{d}$ determined as the eigenvalue of the system. The inner

factor of 0.9 to 1.0 of existing optically-thick prescriptions and which
reduces to the existing optically-thin prescription for isothermal gas. For a

measuring dark-matter subhaloes at low masses. Despite their predicted lack of
stars, these subhaloes may be detectable through gravitational lensing or via
their gravitational perturbations on stellar streams. To set measurable
expectations for subhalo populations within LambdaCDM, we examine 11 Milky Way
(MW)-mass haloes from the FIRE-2 baryonic simulations, quantifying the counts
and orbital fluxes for subhaloes with properties relevant to stellar stream
interactions: masses down to 10^6 Msun, distances < 50 kpc of the galactic
center, across z = 0 - 1 (lookback time 0 - 8 Gyr). We provide fits to our
results and their dependence on subhalo mass, distance, and lookback time, for
use in (semi)analytic models. A typical MW-mass halo contains ~16 subhaloes
>10^7 Msun (~1 subhalo >10^8 Msun) within 50 kpc at z = 0. We compare our
results with dark-matter-only versions of the same simulations: because they
lack a central galaxy potential, they overpredict subhalo counts by 2-10x, more
so at smaller distances. Subhalo counts around a given MW-mass galaxy declined
over time, being ~10x higher at z = 1 than at z = 0. Subhaloes have nearly
isotropic orbital velocity distributions at z = 0. Across our simulations, we
also identified 4 analogs of Large Magellanic Cloud satellite passages; these
analogs enhance subhalo counts by 1.4-2.7 times, significantly increasing the
expected subhalo population around the MW today. Our results imply an
interaction rate of ~5 per Gyr for a stream like GD-1, sufficient to make
subhalo-stream interactions a promising method of measuring dark subhaloes.

have reported a deficit in the measured event rate which, in combination, has
reached a statistical significance of $\sim 5\sigma$. In this paper, we explore
avenues for explaining this anomaly, both within the Standard Model and beyond.
First, we discuss possible biases in the predicted cross section for the
detection reaction $\nu_e + ^{71}\text{Ga} \to e^- + ^{71}\text{Ge}$, which
could arise from mismeasurement of the inverse process, $^{71}\text{Ge}$ decay,
or from the presence of as yet unknown low-lying excited states of
$^{71}\text{Ga}$. The latter would imply that not all $^{71}\text{Ge}$ decays
go to the ground state of $^{71}\text{Ga}$, so the extraction of the ground
state-to-ground state matrix element relevant for neutrino capture on gallium
would be incorrect. Second, we scrutinize the measurement of the source
intensity in gallium experiments, and we point out that a $\sim 2\%$ error in
the branching ratios for $^{51}\text{Cr}$ decay would be enough to explain the
anomaly. Third, we investigate the calibration of the radiochemical germanium
extraction efficiency as a possible origin of anomaly. Finally, we outline
several new explanations beyond the Standard Model, including scenarios with
sterile neutrinos coupled to fuzzy dark matter or to dark energy, as well as a
model with decaying sterile neutrinos. We critically assess the viability of
these scenarios, and others that have been proposed, in a summary table.

general entangling regions, the prescription breaks down as the corresponding
modular Hamiltonians become inherently nonlocal. We develop a formalism for
general shape deformations and derive a flow equation that accounts for these
effects as a systematic expansion. We solve this equation for a complete set of
small deformations and show that the structure of the expansion explicitly
codifies the expected nonlocalities. Our findings are consistent with numerical
results existing in the literature, and shed light on the fundamental nature of
quantum entanglement as a nonlocal phenomenon.

appear to display an at least approximate discrete self-similarity with an

detect Ly$\alpha$ emission around three bright quasars with $2.25<z<2.27$, a
range which is free from bright IR sky lines for H$\alpha$, and then selected
the most extended nebula for H$\alpha$ follow-up with MOSFIRE. Within the
MOSFIRE slit, we detected H$\alpha$ emission extending up to 20 physical kpc

strategy to run an entire QSP protocol on noisy quantum hardware by carefully

the application of Hamiltonian simulation for which QSP implements a polynomial

exact numerical simulations. To make the best use of the device, we determine
optimal experimental parameters by using a simplified error model for the

on SDSS J164100.10+345452.7, a nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy formerly
known as radio quiet which was recently detected both in the radio (at 37 GHz)
and in the $\gamma$-rays, which hints at the presence of a relativistic jet.
During our 20-month Swift campaign, while pursuing the primary goal of
assessing the baseline optical/UV and X-ray properties of J1641, we caught two
radio flaring episodes, one each year. Our strictly simultaneous
multi-wavelength data closely match the radio flare and allow us to
unambiguously link the jetted radio emission of J1641. Indeed, for the X-ray
spectra preceding and following the radio flare a simple absorbed power-law
model is not an adequate description, and an extra absorption component is
required. The average spectrum of J1641 can be best described by an absorbed
power law model with a photon index $\Gamma=1.93\pm0.12$, modified by a
partially covering neutral absorber with a covering fraction
$f=0.91_{-0.03}^{+0.02}$. On the contrary, the X-ray spectrum closest to the
radio flare does not require such extra absorber and is much harder
($\Gamma_{\rm flare} \sim 0.7\pm0.4$), thus implying the emergence of a
further, harder spectral component. We interpret this as the jet emission
emerging from a gap in the absorber. The fractional variability we derive in
the optical/UV and X-ray bands are found to be lower than the typical values
reported in the literature, since our observations of J1641 are dominated by
the source being in a low state. Under the assumption that the origin of the 37
GHz radio flare is the emergence of a jet from an obscuring screen also
observed in the X-rays, the derived total jet power is $P^{\rm tot}_{\rm
jet}=3.5\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, comparable to the lowest measured in the
literature. [Abridged]

neural networks. Specifically, we use BACCOemu to model the linear and
nonlinear matter power spectrum including baryonic physics, allowing us to
robustly exploit scales smaller than those used by the DES Collaboration. We
show that the additional data produce cosmological parameters that are tighter
but consistent with those obtained from larger scales, while also constraining
the distribution of baryons. In particular, we measure the mass scale at which
haloes have lost half of their gas, $\log\,M_{\rm

quantifies the weighted amplitudes of the present-day matter inhomogeneities,

compatible with that inferred from the Planck satellite's data at the

encoded in their brackets. We illustrate that a necessary and sufficient
condition for such a diagram to define a morphism is that the two algebroids
possess gauge-equivalent connections. This observation indicates that the set
of Lie algebroid morphisms should be regarded as equivalent to the set of local
diffeomorphisms and gauge transformations. Moreover, a Lie algebroid morphism
being a chain map in the exterior algebra sense ensures that morphic algebroids
are cohomologically equivalent. The Atiyah Lie algebroids derived from
principal bundles with common base manifolds and structure groups may therefore
be divided into equivalence classes of morphic algebroids. Each equivalence
class possesses a representative which we refer to as the trivialized Lie
algebroid, and we show that the exterior algebra of the trivialized algebroid
gives rise to the BRST complex. We conclude by illustrating the usefulness of
Lie algebroid cohomology in computing quantum anomalies. In particular, we pay
close attention to the fact that the geometric intuition afforded by the Lie
algebroid (which was absent in the naive BRST complex) provides hints of a
deeper picture that simultaneously geometrizes the consistent and covariant
forms of the anomaly. In the algebroid construction, the difference between the
consistent and covariant anomalies is simply a different choice of basis.

observed exponential growth in the volume of available data and the technology

a well-defined task. For instance, we need a corpus of text broken into
sentences to train a natural language machine-learning model. In this work, we
will use the token \textit{dataset} to designate a structured set of data built
to perform a well-defined task. Moreover, the dataset will be used in most
cases as a blueprint of an entity that at any moment can be stored as a table.
Specifically, in science, each area has unique forms to organize, gather and
handle its datasets. We believe that datasets must be a first-class entity in
any knowledge-intensive process, and all workflows should have exceptional
attention to datasets' lifecycle, from their gathering to uses and evolution.
We advocate that science and engineering discovery processes are extreme
instances of the need for such organization on datasets, claiming for new
approaches and tooling. Furthermore, these requirements are more evident when
the discovery workflow uses artificial intelligence methods to empower the
subject-matter expert. In this work, we discuss an approach to bringing
datasets as a critical entity in the discovery process in science. We
illustrate some concepts using material discovery as a use case. We chose this
domain because it leverages many significant problems that can be generalized

human and object proposals to increase the quality of positive pairs within the

we use a large language model to query which interactions are possible between
a human and a given object category, in order to force the model not to put

inner heliosheath obtained by the existing at that time models of the global
heliosphere was significantly larger (by 20-40 AU). Until now, the problem of
the heliosheath thickness has not been fully resolved. Earlier in the frame of
an oversimplified toy model of nearly isothermal solar wind plasma it has been
shown that the effect of electron thermal conduction may significantly reduce
the thickness of the inner heliosheath.
  In this paper, we present the first results of our 3D kinetic-MHD model of
the global heliosphere, where the effect of thermal electron conduction has
been considered rigorously. The thermal conduction acts mainly along the
magnetic field lines. Classical and saturated thermal fluxes are employed when
appropriate.
  It is shown the effects of thermal conduction are significant. The thickness
of the inner heliospheric is reduced. It is desired effect since it helps to
reconcile the thickness obtained in the model with Voyager data. The other
effects are the strong depletion of the heliosheath plasma temperature toward
the heliopause and the increase of the plasma temperature in the supersonic
solar wind upstream of the termination shock.

basal slip due to the complex crystal structure. Here, we compare the barriers
for basal slip for the known mechanisms of direct slip, synchroshear and
undulating slip using density functional theory calculations. According to our
calculated generalized stacking fault (SF) energies, the most favorable
mechanisms are synchroshear and undulating slip. Both mechanisms lead to stable
SF with a formation energy of 50 $mJ/m^2$ through the same unstable SF
configuration at the transition. The energy barrier of approximately 3 $J/m^2$
indicates a low dislocation mobility as expected from the brittle character. We
also determine the influence of vacancies and antisite defects on the formation
energy of stable and unstable SF. Both kinds of point defects tend to lower the
energy barrier on both sides of 2:1 stoichiometry. This explains the
experimentally observed off-stoichiometric softening of C14-Fe$_2$Nb. The small
energy differences between the Fe$_2$Nb Laves phase polytypes raises the
question if there are further deformation mechanisms with low barrier.
Therefore, we additionally consider transformations between C14, C15 and C36
Laves phases as further deformation mechanism. Our calculations for polytypic
transformations by successive synchroshear steps show that the corresponding
energy barriers are in fact very similar to the energy barrier for basal slip
in C14. This suggests that the energy needed to create a stable SF in C14 by
synchroshear is also sufficient to initiate polytypic transformations where
existing SFs in C14 are further transformed to form C15 or C36 Laves phases.

the smearing of the classical singularity, and by the presence of two horizons
with a related extremal configuration. For concreteness, we focus on a
$2\text{D}$ version of the Hayward black hole. We find a second order
thermodynamic phase transition, separating large unstable black holes from
stable configurations close to extremality. We first describe the black-hole
evaporation process using a quasistatic approximation and we show that it ends
in the extremal configuration in an infinite amount of time. We go beyond the
quasistatic approximation by numerically integrating the field equations for
$2\text{D}$ dilaton gravity coupled to $N$ massless scalar fields, describing
the radiation. We find that the inclusion of large backreaction effects ($N \gg
1$) allows for an end-point extremal configuration after a finite evaporation
time. Finally, we evaluate the entanglement entropy (EE) of the radiation in
the quasistatic approximation and construct the relative Page curve. We find
that the EE initially grows, reaches a maximum and then goes down towards zero,
in agreement with previous results in the literature. Despite the breakdown of
the semiclassical approximation prevents the description of the evaporation
process near extremality, we have a clear indication that the end point of the
evaporation is a regular, extremal state with vanishing EE of the radiation.
This means that the nonunitary evolution, which commonly characterizes the
evaporation of singular black holes, could be traced back to the presence of
the singularity.

core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and neutron star mergers (NSMs), can
experience fast flavor conversions on relatively short scales. This can happen
if the neutrino electron lepton number ($\nu$ELN) angular distribution crosses
zero in a certain direction. Despite this, most of the state-of-the-art CCSN
and NSM simulations do not provide such detailed angular information and
instead, supply only a few moments of the neutrino angular distributions. In
this study we employ, for the \emph{first} time, a machine learning (ML)
approach to this problem and show that it can be extremely successful in
detecting $\nu$ELN crossings on the basis of its zeroth and first moments. We
observe that an accuracy of $\sim95\%$ can be achieved by the ML algorithms,
which almost corresponds to the Bayes error rate of our problem. Considering
its remarkable efficiency and agility, the ML approach provides one with an
unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the occurrence of FFCs in CCSN and NSM
simulations \emph{on the fly}. We also provide our ML methodologies on GitHub.

where the observations come from two dependent groups sharing the same
variables. We focus on a family of coloured Gaussian graphical models
specifically suited for the paired data problem. Commonly, graphical models are
ordered by the submodel relationship so that the search space is a lattice,
called the model inclusion lattice. We introduce a novel order between models,
named the twin order. We show that, embedded with this order, the model space
is a lattice that, unlike the model inclusion lattice, is distributive.
Furthermore, we provide the relevant rules for the computation of the
neighbours of a model. The latter are more efficient than the same operations
in the model inclusion lattice, and are then exploited to achieve a more
efficient exploration of the search space. These results can be applied to
improve the efficiency of both greedy and Bayesian model search procedures.
Here we implement a stepwise backward elimination procedure and evaluate its
performance by means of simulations. Finally, the procedure is applied to learn
a brain network from fMRI data where the two groups correspond to the left and
right hemispheres, respectively.

dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene exhibit unique coupled spin and
momentum-valley physics (valley pseudospin) owing to broken spatial inversion
symmetry and strong spin-orbit coupling. Circularly polarized light provides
the means for pseudospin-selective excitation of excitons (or electrons and
holes) and can yield momentum-valley polarized populations of carriers that are
the subject of proposed valleytronic applications. The chirality of these
excited carriers have important consequences for the available
relaxation/scattering pathways, which must conserve (pseudo)angular momentum as
well as energy. One available relaxation channel that satisfies these
constraints is coupling to chiral phonons. Here we show that chiral
carrier-phonon coupling following valley-polarized photoexcitation is expected
to leads to a strongly valley-polarized chiral phonon distribution that is
directly measurable using ultrafast phonon-diffuse scattering techniques. Using
ab-initio calculations we show how the dynamic phonon occupations and valley
anisotropy determined by nonequilibrium observations can provide a new window
on the physical processes that drive carrier valley-depolarization in monolayer
TMDs.

Recent advancements in both Monte Carlo simulations and computational human
phantom developments have allowed for complex radiation simulations and
dosimetric calculations to be performed for numerous applications. In this
work, advanced tetrahedral-type human phantoms were exposed to a simulated
spectrum of particles equivalent to a single days exposure in the International
Space Station in Low Earth Orbit. 3D Monte Carlo techniques were used to
produce and simulate the radiation spectra. Organ absorbed dose, average energy
deposition, and the whole-body integral dose was determined for a male and
female phantom. Results were then extrapolated for two long-term scenarios: a
6-9 month mission on the International Space Station and a 3-year mission to
Mars. The whole-body integral dose for the male and female models were found to
be 0.2985 +- 0.0002 mGy/day 0.3050 +- 0.0002 mGy/day, respectively, which is
within 10% of recorded dose values from the International Space Station. This
work presents a novel approach to assess absorbed dose from space-like
radiation fields using high-fidelity computational phantoms, highlighting the
utility of complex models for space radiation research.

that are interacting with one another in some way. The nature of a contact,
whether a point, line, or surface, dictates how these bodies are able to move
with respect to one another given a force, and a set of contacts can provide
either partial or full constraint on a body's motion. Decades of work have
explored how to explicitly estimate the location of a contact and its dynamics,
e.g., frictional properties, but investigated methods have been computationally
expensive and there often exists significant uncertainty in the final
calculation. This has affected further advancements in contact-rich tasks that
are seemingly simple to humans, such as generalized peg-in-hole insertions. In
this work, instead of explicitly estimating the individual contact dynamics
between an object and its hole, we approach this problem by investigating
compliance-enabled contact formations. More formally, contact formations are
defined according to the constraints imposed on an object's available
degrees-of-freedom. Rather than estimating individual contact positions, we
abstract out this calculation to an implicit representation, allowing the robot
to either acquire, maintain, or release constraints on the object during the
insertion process, by monitoring forces enacted on the end effector through
time. Using a compliant robot, our method is desirable in that we are able to
complete industry-relevant insertion tasks of tolerances <0.25mm without prior
knowledge of the exact hole location or its orientation. We showcase our method
on more generalized insertion tasks, such as commercially available
non-cylindrical objects and open world plug tasks.

chaotic diffusion caused by an overlap of secular resonances can increase the

driving the system to instability. Previous work has shown that including
general relativistic contributions to the planets' precession frequency is
crucial when modelling the solar system. It reduces the probability that the
solar system destabilizes within 5 Gyr by a factor of 60. We run 1280
additional N-body simulations of the solar system spanning 12.5 Gyr where we
allow the GR precession rate to vary with time. We develop a simple, unified,
Fokker-Planck advection-diffusion model that can reproduce the instability time
of Mercury with, without, and with time-varying GR precession. We show that
while ignoring GR precession does move Mercury's precession frequency closer to
a resonance with Jupiter, this alone does not explain the increased instability
rate. It is necessary that there is also a significant increase in the rate of
diffusion. We find that the system responds smoothly to a change in the
precession frequency: There is no critical GR precession frequency below which
the solar system becomes significantly more unstable. Our results show that the
long-term evolution of the solar system is well described with an

erroneously induce atomic polarization, leading to spurious polarizations in

strong negative trend in the dark matter fraction $f_{DM}$ with increasing
baryonic surface density. For this to be true, the inner baryons must dominate
over dark matter in early massive galaxies, as observed in the Milky Way today.
If disks are dominant at early times, we show that stellar bars form promptly
within these disks, leading to a high bar fraction at early times. New JWST
observations provide the best evidence to date for mature stellar bars in this
redshift range. The disk mass fraction $f_{disk}$ within $R_s=2.2 R_{disk}$ is
the dominant factor in determining how rapidly a bar forms. Using 3D hydro
simulations of halo-disk-bulge galaxies, we confirm the ""Fujii relation"" for
the exponential dependence of the bar formation time $\tau_{bar}$ as a function
of $f_{disk}$. For $f_{disk} > 0.3$, the bar formation time declines
exponentially fast with increasing $f_{disk}$. This relation is a challenge to
simulators - barred models with inadequate resolution fall off this curve.
Instead of Fujii's arbitrary threshold for when a bar forms, for the first
time, we exploit the exponential growth timescale associated with a positive
feedback cycle as the bar emerges from the underlying disk. A modified,
mass-dependent trend is observed for halos relevant to systems at cosmic noon
($10.5 < \log M_{halo} < 12$), where the bar onset is slower for higher mass
halos at a fixed $f_{disk}$. If baryons dominate over dark matter within $R
\approx R_s$, we predict that a high fraction of bars will be found in
high-redshift disks long before $z = 1$. Due to its widespread use in
simulations, we investigate the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte criterion for bar
instability: this sub-optimal parameter is inversely related to $f_{disk}$,
with a secondary dependence on $M_{halo}$.

on single robots with basic kinematic constraints in open spaces, SocialGym 2
employs multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop optimal navigation
policies for multiple robots with diverse, dynamic constraints in complex
environments. Built on the PettingZoo MARL library and Stable Baselines3 API,
SocialGym 2 offers an accessible python interface that integrates with a
navigation stack through ROS messaging. SocialGym 2 can be easily installed and
is packaged in a docker container, and it provides the capability to swap and
evaluate different MARL algorithms, as well as customize observation and reward
functions. We also provide scripts to allow users to create their own
environments and have conducted benchmarks using various social navigation
algorithms, reporting a broad range of social navigation metrics. Projected

reactions and the rules of natural selection of organisms is proposed. The
theory is based on a hypothesis that the biochemical processes in the organism
can be described in the terms of chemical reaction kinetics. The evolutionary
process of organisms is determined by the goal of continuing life, and the
natural selection forced organisms to develop in an optimized way for survival
and reproduction, after which any further development of the organisms did not
matter for natural selection and therefore was not regulated by it.
Accordingly, the ongoing biochemical processes in the organism after giving
birth were not stabilised and continued casual, which, in the case of complex
systems of biochemical processes, led to imbalances and biochemical processes
that did not contribute to health in the organism, resulting in aging. Based on
this view, it is necessary to look for the key biochemical processes that
regulate the vital activity of the organism. Balancing of these processes in
the period after giving birth can artificially lead to the stabilization of the
kinetics of biochemical reactions, and consequently, the continuation of life
almost indefinitely.

We find that the multi-armed spiral structure grows in the stable gaseous

demonstrate that together with the dust concentration, the important factor for
the development of instability is the size of the dust grains. A nonlinear
multi-armed spiral pattern develops in the stable gaseous disk with sizes of
grains larger than one micron. If future observations confirm the presence of a
large amount of dust in the mini-disks of galaxies, this will pinpoint the

orders. The shape and intensity of this divergence depends sensitively on the
order and symmetry of the VHs, and hence a detailed understanding of the
low-energy electronic structure is essential to understand the role of VHss in
emergent phases. A family of materials with a large diversity of emergent
phases that can be related to VHss close to the Fermi energy is the
Ruddlesden-Popper series of the strontium ruthenates. Here we study the
low-energy electronic structure at the surface of ferromagnetic
Sr$_4$Ru$_3$O$_{10}$ by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy at

heavily rely on GPUs to achieve high performance; however, support for GPUs is

a novel GPU-enabled FaaS solution that enables ML inference functions to
efficiently utilize GPUs to accelerate their computations. First, it extends
existing FaaS frameworks such as OpenFaaS to support the scheduling and
execution of functions across GPUs in a FaaS cluster. Second, it provides
caching of ML models in GPU memory to improve the performance of model
inference functions and global management of GPU memories to improve cache
utilization. Third, it offers co-designed GPU function scheduling and cache
management to optimize the performance of ML inference functions. Specifically,
the paper proposes locality-aware scheduling, which maximizes the utilization
of both GPU memory for cache hits and GPU cores for parallel processing. A
thorough evaluation based on real-world traces and ML models shows that the

AdaOFUL achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound of
$\widetilde{O}\big(d\big(\sum_{t=1}^T \nu_{t}^2\big)^{1/2}+d\big)$ as if the
rewards were uniformly bounded, where $\nu_{t}^2$ is the observed conditional
variance of the reward at round $t$, $d$ is the feature dimension, and
$\widetilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides logarithmic dependence. Building upon AdaOFUL, we
propose VARA for linear MDPs, which achieves a tighter variance-aware regret
bound of $\widetilde{O}(d\sqrt{HG^*K})$. Here, $H$ is the length of episodes,
$K$ is the number of episodes, and $G^*$ is a smaller instance-dependent
quantity that can be bounded by other instance-dependent quantities when
additional structural conditions on the MDP are satisfied. Our regret bound is
superior to the current state-of-the-art bounds in three ways: (1) it depends
on a tighter instance-dependent quantity and has optimal dependence on $d$ and
$H$, (2) we can obtain further instance-dependent bounds of $G^*$ under
additional structural conditions on the MDP, and (3) our regret bound is valid
even when rewards have only finite variances, achieving a level of generality
unmatched by previous works. Overall, our modified adaptive Huber regression
algorithm may serve as a useful building block in the design of algorithms for
online problems with heavy-tailed rewards.

Jack Herring used a greatly truncated version of the complete Boussinesq

enclosures at high Rayleigh numbers, it is perhaps not an implausible point of
view from which to reexamine high-Rayleigh-number data. Here we compare past
experimental data on convective heat transport at high Rayleigh numbers with
predictions from Herring's model and, in fact, find excellent agreement. The
model has only one unknown parameter compared to the two free parameters
present in the lowest order least-squares power-law fit. We discuss why the
underlying simplistic physical picture, meant to work at Rayleigh numbers
slightly past the critical value of a few thousands, is consistent with the

the effect of the bias current leads on the performance of the device have not
been previously addressed. In this work, we introduce a theoretical model for
two-dimensional superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) arrays
capable of simulating the response of devices with different bias current
configurations. First, we compare uniformly biased and centre biased SQUID
arrays by investigating the voltage versus magnetic flux response, maximum
transfer function and voltage modulation depth. Then, we calculate the
time-averaged fluxoid distributions for 1D and 2D centre biased arrays.
Finally, we study the performance of the two bias current configurations
depending on array size, screening parameter, thermal noise strength and
kinetic self-inductance fraction. Our calculations reveal: (i) centre biased 1D
parallel SQUID arrays present an unusual voltage response caused by the
asymmetric fluxoid distribution; (ii) the optimal transfer function of centre
biased arrays strongly depends on the number of junctions in parallel; (iii)
the performance of centre biased arrays approaches the uniform biased ones when
the number of junctions in series exceeds those in parallel; (iv) while the
screening parameter and the thermal noise strength clearly affect the device
performance, the kinetic self-inductance fraction seems to play only a
secondary role.

stage involves inflexible heuristic rules and a separate refinement model; and
2) the training cannot balance the number of user clicks and model performance.
To address the challenges, we propose a click-based and mask-guided interactive
image segmentation framework containing three novel components: Cascade-Forward
Refinement (CFR), Iterative Click Loss (ICL), and SUEM image augmentation. The
proposed ICL allows model training to improve segmentation and reduce user
interactions simultaneously. The CFR offers a unified inference framework to
generate segmentation results in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed SUEM
augmentation is a comprehensive way to create large and diverse training sets
for interactive image segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on five public datasets.
Remarkably, our model achieves an average of 2.9 and 7.5 clicks of NoC@95 on

explores two important topics: the inclusion of both magnetic and electric
charge to produce what it calls Extended Electrodynamics, and the existence of
a symmetry called Dyality Invariance that exchanges electric and magnetic
quantities. First, the paper summarizes Extended Electrodynamics, including
potentials, gauge transformations, and a new proof of the extended
electrodynamic Poynting theorem. A formal Lagrangian derivation of the extended
Maxwell equations is also given, but its value in fundamental studies is
questioned. The paper then defines Dyality Invariance (form invariance under
the so-called Dyality Transformation that exchanges electric and magnetic
quantities) and shows it to be a valid symmetry if and only if electrodynamics
is given the extended form. The paper suggests that the complete Maxwellian
electrodynamics is extended electrodynamics with its dyality invariance. But
dyality can be interpreted either actively or passively. Since magnetic charge
has not been observed experimentally, the active interpretation is ruled out.
But a passive interpretation can be used to avoid writing magnetic source and
potential terms explicitly. The paper also refutes the idea that dyality
invariance would permit a magnetic charge to be transformed away even if one
existed. If nonzero magnetic charge exists, then experimental evidence for its
existence cannot be hidden by a dyality transformation.

39+-8 K for one source. Protostellar outflows are also detected from both
sources as high-velocity components of CO. The metallicity-scaled abundances of
SO2 in hot cores are comparable among the SMC, LMC, and Galactic sources,
suggesting that the chemical reactions leading to SO2 formation would be
regulated by elemental abundances. On the other hand, CH3OH shows a large
abundance variation within SMC and LMC hot cores. The diversity in the initial

history. A large obliquity may either indicate a primordial misalignment
between the star and its gaseous disk or reflect the effect of different
mechanisms tilting planetary systems after formation. Observations and
statistical analysis suggest that system of planets with sizes between 1 and 4
R$_{\oplus}$ have a wide range of obliquities ($\sim0-30^{\circ}$), and that
single- and multi-planet transiting have statistically indistinguishable
obliquity distributions. Here, we revisit the ``breaking the chains'' formation
model with focus in understanding the origin of spin-orbit obliquities. This
model suggests that super-Earths and mini-Neptunes migrate close to their host
stars via planet-disk gravitational interactions, forming chain of planets
locked in mean-motion resonances. After gas-disk dispersal, about 90-99\% of
these planetary systems experience dynamical instabilities, which spread the
systems out. Using synthetic transit observations, we show that if planets are
born in disks where the disk angular momentum is virtually aligned with the
star's rotation spin, their final obliquity distributions peak at about $\sim$5
degrees or less, and the obliquity distributions of single and multi-planet
transiting systems are statistically distinct. By treating the star-disk
alignment as a free-parameter, we show that the obliquity distributions of
single and multi-planet transiting systems only become statistically
indistinguishable if planets are assumed to form in primordially misaligned
natal disks with a ``tilt'' distribution peaking at $\gtrsim$10-20 deg. We
discuss the origin of these misalignments in the context of star formation and
potential implications of this scenario for formation models.

proposed, yielding the quadratic speedup with respect to the spectral gap

quantum version of the MH algorithm in the case that calculating $P$ is costly
because the log-likelihood $L$ for a state $x\in\Omega$ is obtained via
computing the sum of many terms $\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=0}^{M-1} \ell(i,x)$. We
propose calculating $L$ by quantum Monte Carlo integration and combine it with
the existing method called quantum simulated annealing (QSA) to generate the
quantum state that encodes $P$ in amplitudes. We consider not only state
generation but also finding a credible interval for a parameter, a common task

calculation, the number of queries to the quantum circuit to compute $\ell$
scales on $\Delta$, the required accuracy $\epsilon$ and the standard deviation
$\sigma$ of $\ell$ as $\tilde{O}(\sigma/\epsilon^2\Delta^{3/2})$, in contrast
to $\tilde{O}(M/\epsilon\Delta^{1/2})$ for QSA with $L$ calculated exactly.
Therefore, the proposed method is advantageous if $\sigma$ scales on $M$
sublinearly. As one such example, we consider parameter estimation in a
gravitational wave experiment, where $\sigma=O(M^{1/2})$.

Moreover, BPTT requires storing the complete history of network states between

length. This makes BPTT unsuited for online learning and presents a challenge
for implementation on low-resource real-time systems. Real-Time Recurrent
Learning (RTRL) allows online learning, and the growth of required memory is
independent of sequence length. However, RTRL suffers from exceptionally high
computational costs that grow proportional to the fourth power of the state
size, making RTRL computationally intractable for all but the smallest of
networks. In this work, we show that recurrent networks exhibiting high
activity sparsity can reduce the computational cost of RTRL. Moreover,
combining activity and parameter sparsity can lead to significant enough
savings in computational and memory costs to make RTRL practical. Unlike

investigate fundamental physics and chemistry at the nanoscale. Reproducibility
in these experiments relies on measuring conductance on thousands of freshly

Experiments typically focus on the most probable conductance, while the
information content of the conductance histogram has remained unclear. Here, we
develop a theory for the conductance histogram by merging the theory of
force-spectroscopy with molecular conductance. To do so, we propose a
microscopic model of the junction evolution under the modulation of external
mechanical forces and combine it with the statistics of junction rupture and
formation. Our formulation focuses on contributions to the conductance
dispersion that emerge due to changes in the conductance during mechanical
manipulation. The final shape of the histogram is determined by the statistics
of junction rupture and formation. The procedure yields analytical equations
for the conductance histogram in terms of parameters that describe the
free-energy profile of the junction, its mechanical manipulation, and the
ability of the molecule to transport charge. All physical parameters that
define our microscopic model can be extracted from separate conductance and
rupture force measurements on molecular junctions. Our theory accurately fits
experimental conductance histograms and augments the information content that
can be extracted from experiments. Further, the predicted behavior with respect
to physical parameters can be used to design experiments with narrower
conductance distribution and to test the range of validity of the model.

system with the environment guides the evolution to a more classically mixed
state, it is worth investigating what effect the introduction of dephasing has
on the relationship between performance and robustness. In this paper we
analyze the robustness of the fidelity error, as measured by the logarithmic
sensitivity function, to dephasing processes. We show that introduction of
dephasing as a perturbation to the nominal unitary dynamics requires a
modification of the log-sensitivity formulation used to measure robustness
about an uncertain parameter with non-zero nominal value used in previous work.
We consider controllers optimized for a number of target objectives ranging
from fidelity under coherent evolution to fidelity under dephasing dynamics to
determine the extent to which optimizing for a specific regime has desirable
effects in terms of robustness. Our analysis is based on two independent
computations of the log-sensitivity: a statistical Monte Carlo approach and an
analytic calculation. We show that despite the different log sensitivity
calculations employed in this study, both demonstrate that the log-sensitivity

after input. We first show that gravitational lensing obeys the causality in
the sense that (electromagnetic/gravitational) waves emitted from the source
arrive at an observer only after the arrival of the signal in geometrical
optics. This is done by extending the previous work which is based on the thin
lens approximation. We then derive the Kramers-Kronig relation in gravitational
lensing, as the relation between real and imaginary parts of the amplification
factor, which is the amplitude ratio of the lensed wave to the unlensed wave.
As a byproduct, we find a new relation that equates integration of the square
of the real part of the amplification factor over frequency to that for the
imaginary part of the amplification factor. We also obtain a sum rule which
relates the integral of the imaginary part of the amplification factor with the
magnification of the first arrival image in geometrical optics. Finally, we
argue that an incorrect separation of the observed gravitational waveform into
the amplification factor and the unlensed waveform generically leads to the
violation of the Kramers-Kronig relation. Our work suggests that examining the
violation of the Kramers-Kronig relation may be used for correctly extracting
the lensing signal in the gravitational wave observations.

information for traffic management and control. However, due to limited
deployment of traffic sensors, obtaining full-scale volume information is far
from easy. Existing works on this topic primarily focus on improving the
overall estimation accuracy of a particular method and ignore the underlying
challenges of volume estimation, thereby having inferior performances on some
critical tasks. This paper studies two key problems with regard to traffic
volume estimation: (1) underdetermined traffic flows caused by undetected
movements, and (2) non-equilibrium traffic flows arise from congestion
propagation. Here we demonstrate a graph-based deep learning method that can
offer a data-driven, model-free and correlation adaptive approach to tackle the
above issues and perform accurate network-wide traffic volume estimation.
Particularly, in order to quantify the dynamic and nonlinear relationships
between traffic speed and volume for the estimation of underdetermined flows, a
speed patternadaptive adjacent matrix based on graph attention is developed and
integrated into the graph convolution process, to capture non-local
correlations between sensors. To measure the impacts of non-equilibrium flows,
a temporal masked and clipped attention combined with a gated temporal
convolution layer is customized to capture time-asynchronous correlations
between upstream and downstream sensors. We then evaluate our model on a
real-world highway traffic volume dataset and compare it with several benchmark
models. It is demonstrated that the proposed model achieves high estimation
accuracy even under 20% sensor coverage rate and outperforms other baselines
significantly, especially on underdetermined and non-equilibrium flow
locations. Furthermore, comprehensive quantitative model analysis are also
carried out to justify the model designs.

micro-discs were obtained. The shape-controlled particles were synthesized by
polymerizing divinylbenzene (DVB) via initiated chemical vapor deposition

delivered vapor-phase reactants, thus avoiding disruption of the LC structure,
a critical limitation in past LC-templated polymerization. That shape
controllability was further enabled by leveraging LC as a real-time display of
the polymerization conditions and progression, using a custom in-situ
long-focal range microscope. Detailed image analysis unraveled key mechanisms
in polymer synthesis in LC. Poor solubilization by nematic LC led to the
formation of pDVB nanospheres, distinct from microspheres obtained in isotropic
solvents. The nanospheres precipitated to the LC-solid interface and further
aggregated into microgel clusters with controlled orientation that was guided
by the LC molecular alignment. On further polymerization, microgel clusters

state can be written as a generalized form of the shallow water equations with
Coriolis force, where the density replaces the height of the fluid column and
the magnetic field plays the role of the Coriolis parameter. In the FQH case,
the potential vorticity associated with the shallow water model becomes a
constant. In contrast to the shallow water equations, the hydro system for the
FQH state contains higher derivatives of velocity which enforces the no-stress
boundary condition in addition to the no-penetration condition at the hard wall
or coastal boundary. For these boundary conditions, the linearized edge
dynamics has two chiral edge modes propagating in the same direction: a
non-dispersing Kelvin mode and a dispersing chiral boson mode. We investigate
the nature of these modes in the presence of a tangent electric field. Our
results show that the Kelvin mode cannot be excited by this field, and as a
result, it cannot transport charge along the edge. However, the dispersive
chiral boson mode is compatible with the edge dynamics of the FQH state and

path from the aspects of both benchmark and pretraining methods. Specifically,
we propose a \textbf{HumanBench} based on existing datasets to comprehensively
evaluate on the common ground the generalization abilities of different
pretraining methods on 19 datasets from 6 diverse downstream tasks, including
person ReID, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition,
pedestrian detection, and crowd counting. To learn both coarse-grained and
fine-grained knowledge in human bodies, we further propose a \textbf{P}rojector
\textbf{A}ssis\textbf{T}ed \textbf{H}ierarchical pretraining method

rearranged scenes provide an average of 14% more accessible space and 30% more

validated by a human study, indicating the efficacy of the proposed strategy.

research areas containing the Poincar\'{e} polynomial of ranked posets and the
growth function of finitely generated groups. In particular, the magnitude

of the magnitude homology and its variants. Such a homotopy includes digraph
homotopy and r-closeness of Lipschitz maps. As a benefit of our categorical

notion called metric fibration that is initially introduced by Leinster. It is
remarkable that the magnitude of such a fibration is a product of those of the

background sounds, so they would be inevitably entangled, causing
misclassification and biased localization results with only clip-level

clip-level labels. Based on the causal analysis, we propose a causal
intervention (CI) method for WSSED to remove the negative impact of
co-occurrence confounders by iteratively accumulating every possible context of

making the event boundary clearer. Experiments show that our method effectively
improves the performance on multiple datasets and can generalize to various

high accuracy, making it appealing to clinical problems such as radiation
therapy. However, the lack of high-quality semantically labelled data remains a
challenge leading to model brittleness to small shifts to input data. Most
works require extra data for semi-supervised learning and lack the
interpretability of the boundaries of the training data distribution during
training, which is essential for model deployment in clinical practice. We
propose a fully supervised generative framework that can achieve generalisable
segmentation with only limited labelled data by simultaneously constructing an
explorable manifold during training. The proposed approach creates medical
image style paired with a segmentation task driven discriminator incorporating
end-to-end adversarial training. The discriminator is generalised to small
domain shifts as much as permissible by the training data, and the generator
automatically diversifies the training samples using a manifold of input
features learnt during segmentation. All the while, the discriminator guides
the manifold learning by supervising the semantic content and fine-grained
features separately during the image diversification. After training,
visualisation of the learnt manifold from the generator is available to
interpret the model limits. Experiments on a fully semantic, publicly available
pelvis dataset demonstrated that our method is more generalisable to shifts
than other state-of-the-art methods while being more explainable using an
explorable manifold.

used methods to quantify cervical elasticity; however, they have limitations.
Strain elastography is effective in showing tissue elasticity distribution in a
single image, but the absence of stress information causes difficulty in
comparing the results acquired from different imaging sessions. Shear wave
elastography is effective in measuring shear wave speed (an intrinsic tissue
property correlated with elasticity) in relatively homogeneous tissue, such as
in the liver. However, for inhomogeneous tissue in the cervix, the shear wave
speed measurement is less robust. To overcome these limitations, we develop a
quantitative cervical elastography system by adding a stress sensor to an
ultrasound imaging system.
  Methods: In an imaging session for quantitative cervical elastography, we use
the transvaginal ultrasound imaging system to record B-mode images of the
cervix showing its deformation and use the stress sensor to record the
probe-surface stress simultaneously. We develop a correlation-based automatic
feature tracking algorithm to quantify the deformation, from which the strain
is quantified. After each imaging session, we calibrate the stress sensor and
transform its measurement to true stress. Applying a linear regression to the
stress and strain, we obtain an approximation of the cervical Young's modulus.
  Results: We validate the accuracy and robustness of this elastography system
using phantom experiments. Applying this system to pregnant participants, we
observe significant softening of the cervix during pregnancy (p-value < 0.001)
with the cervical Young's modulus decreasing 3.95% per week. We estimate that
geometric mean values of cervical Young's moduli during the first (11 to 13
weeks), second, and third trimesters are 13.07 kPa, 7.59 kPa, and 4.40 kPa,

the fundamental issues in intelligent transportation systems. However, previous

underestimations of travel demand in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This study
investigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between
disadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting
of ride-hailing services. A two-pronged approach is taken to reduce the demand
prediction bias. First, we develop a novel deep learning model architecture,
named socially aware neural network (SA-Net), to integrate the
socio-demographics and ridership information for fair demand prediction through
an innovative socially-aware convolution operation. Second, we propose a
bias-mitigation regularization method to mitigate the mean percentage
prediction error gap between different groups. The experimental results,
validated on the real-world Chicago Transportation Network Company (TNC) data,
show that the de-biasing SA-Net can achieve better predictive performance in
both prediction accuracy and fairness. Specifically, the SA-Net improves
prediction accuracy for both the disadvantaged and privileged groups compared
with the state-of-the-art models. When coupled with the bias mitigation
regularization method, the de-biasing SA-Net effectively bridges the mean
percentage prediction error gap between the disadvantaged and privileged
groups, and also protects the disadvantaged regions against systematic
underestimation of TNC demand. Our proposed de-biasing method can be adopted in
many existing short-term travel demand estimation models, and can be utilized
for various other spatial-temporal prediction tasks such as crime incidents
predictions.

However, one critical yet challenging question remains unexplored -- how to
make those ML-based tuning agents work collaboratively. Existing methods do not
consider the dependencies among the multiple agents, and the model used by each
agent only studies the effect of changing the configurations in a single

needed to make the multiple agents cognizant of each other. Also, we need to
decide how to allocate the limited tuning budget among the agents to maximize
the performance. Such a decision is difficult to make since the distribution of
the reward for each agent is unknown and non-stationary. In this paper, we
study the above question and present a unified coordinating framework to
efficiently utilize existing ML-based agents. First, we propose a message

encapsulates the global tuning messages in each agent's model. Second, we
combine Thompson Sampling, a well-studied reinforcement learning algorithm with

angular size is 1.1$\pm$0.2$^{\circ}$. We propose this cloud as a new candidate
to produce the sub-PeV emission observed in LHAASO J2108+5157. Considering a

cm$^{-3}$, and a total nucleon mass(HI+H$_2$) of 1.5$\pm$0.6$\times$10$^4$
M$_{\odot}$. On the other hand, we confirm that Kronberger 82 is a molecular

the physical conditions to produce the observed emission of LHAASO J2108+5157,
[FKT-MC]2022 is located closer to it, suggesting that the latter could be the

squares (MM-QCELS) method to simultaneously estimate multiple eigenvalues of a

Heisenberg-limited scaling. The quantum circuit uses one ancilla qubit, and
under suitable initial state conditions, the circuit depth can be much shorter
than that of quantum phase estimation (QPE) type circuits. As a result, this
method is well-suited for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Our approach
extends and refines the quantum complex exponential least squares (QCELS)
method, recently developed for estimating a single dominant eigenvalue [Ding

eigenvalues also tightens the bound for single dominant eigenvalue estimation.
Numerical results suggest that compared to QPE, the circuit depth can be
reduced by around two orders of magnitude under several settings for estimating
ground-state and excited-state energies of certain quantum systems.

measurements and those from the CMB or BAO+BBN measurements is one of the most
interesting unknowns of modern cosmology. Sample variance forms a key component
of the error on the local measurements, and will dominate the error budget in
the future as more supernovae are observed. Many methods have been proposed to
estimate sample variance in many contexts, and we compared results from a
number of them in Zhai \& Percival (2022), confirming that sample variance for
the Pantheon supernovae sample does not solve the Hubble tension. We now extend
this analysis to include a method based on analytically calculating
correlations between the radial peculiar velocities of supernovae, comparing
this technique with results from numerical simulations, which can be considered
a non-linear Monte-Carlo solution that works similarly. We consider the
dependence of these errors on the linear power spectrum and how non-linear
velocities contribute to the error. Using this technique, and matching sample
variance errors, we can define an effective volume for supernovae samples,
finding that the Pantheon sample is equivalent to a top-hat sphere of radius
$\sim220~h^{-1}$Mpc. We use this link between sample-variance errors to compute
$\Delta H_{0}$ for idealised surveys with particular angular distributions of
supernovae. For example, a half-sky survey at the Pantheon depth has the
potential to suppress the sample variance of $H_{0}$ to $\sim0.1$ km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, a significant improvement compared with the current result.
Finally, we consider the strength of large-scale velocity power spectrum
required to explain the Hubble tension using sample variance, finding it
requires an extreme model well beyond that allowed by other observations.

a smaller training dataset. This is corroborated by training the restricted

$\sigma(G)$, is the goal of the $t$-admissibility problem. Split graphs are
$3$-admissible and can be partitioned into three subclasses: split graphs with
$\sigma=1, 2 $ or $3$. In this work we consider such a partition while dealing
with the problem of coloring a split graph. Vizing proved that any graph can
have its edges colored with $\Delta$ or $\Delta+1$ colors, and thus can be

criticality, safety guard, etc. The proposed FCM is based on composite hazard
analysis and content-based relationships among the hazard analysis artifacts,
and ensures that the safety guard controls the identified faults at design
time; thus, we can effectively manage and control the fault at the design phase
to ensure the safe development of CPSs. To validate our approach, we introduce
a case study on the Platooning system (a collaborative CPS). We perform the
criticality analysis of the Platooning system using FCM in our developed tool.
After the detailed fault criticality analysis, we investigate the results to
check the appropriateness and effectiveness with two research questions. Also,
by performing simulation for the Platooning, we showed that the rate of
collision of the Platooning system without using FCM was quite high as compared
to the rate of collisions of the system after analyzing the fault criticality
using FCM.

  Adaptation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Target domain pseudo-labelling has shown effectiveness in unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA). However, pseudo-labels of unlabeled target domain data are
inevitably noisy due to the distribution shift between source and target
domains. This paper proposes a Generative model-based Noise-Robust Training
method (GeNRT), which eliminates domain shift while mitigating label noise.
GeNRT incorporates a Distribution-based Class-wise Feature Augmentation (D-CFA)
and a Generative-Discriminative classifier Consistency (GDC), both based on the
class-wise target distributions modelled by generative models. D-CFA minimizes
the domain gap by augmenting the source data with distribution-sampled target
features, and trains a noise-robust discriminative classifier by using target
domain knowledge from the generative models. GDC regards all the class-wise
generative models as generative classifiers and enforces a consistency
regularization between the generative and discriminative classifiers. It
exploits an ensemble of target knowledge from all the generative models to
train a noise-robust discriminative classifier and eventually gets
theoretically linked to the Ben-David domain adaptation theorem for reducing
the domain gap. Extensive experiments on Office-Home, PACS, and Digit-Five show
that our GeNRT achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods
under single-source and multi-source UDA settings.

recently been used to learn the geometric and the material properties of the

promising a replacement for traditional rendering algorithms with scalable
quality and predictable performance. In this work we ask the question: Does
neural graphics (NG) need hardware support? We studied representative NG
applications showing that, if we want to render 4k res. at 60FPS there is a gap
of 1.5X-55X in the desired performance on current GPUs. For AR/VR applications,
there is an even larger gap of 2-4 OOM between the desired performance and the
required system power. We identify that the input encoding and the MLP kernels
are the performance bottlenecks, consuming 72%,60% and 59% of application time
for multi res. hashgrid, multi res. densegrid and low res. densegrid encodings,
respectively. We propose a NG processing cluster, a scalable and flexible
hardware architecture that directly accelerates the input encoding and MLP

We also accelerate the rest of the kernels by fusing them together in Vulkan,
which leads to 9.94X kernel-level performance improvement compared to un-fused
implementation of the pre-processing and the post-processing kernels. Our
results show that, NGPC gives up to 58X end-to-end application-level

wireless communications, yet they are also expected to achieve radio sensing
capabilities in the near future. However, most prior studies on radio sensing
usually rely on far-field assumption with uniform plane wave (UPW) models. With
the ever-increasing antenna size, together with the growing demands to sense
nearby targets, the conventional far-field UPW assumption may become invalid.
Therefore, this paper studies near-field radio sensing with extremely
large-scale (XL) antenna arrays, where the more general uniform spheric wave
(USW) sensing model is considered. Closed-form expressions of the Cram\'er-Rao
Bounds (CRBs) for both angle and range estimations are derived for near-field
XL-MIMO radar mode and XL-phased array radar mode, respectively. Our results
reveal that different from the conventional UPW model where the CRB for angle
decreases unboundedly as the number of antennas increases, for XL-MIMO
radar-based near-field sensing, the CRB decreases with diminishing return and
approaches to a certain limit as the number of antennas increases. Besides,
different from the far-field model where the CRB for range is infinity since it
has no range estimation capability, that for the near-field case is finite.
Furthermore, it is revealed that the commonly used spherical wave model based
on second-order Taylor approximation is insufficient for near-field CRB
analysis. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our derived
CRBs.

and network constraints. Then, an energy trading mechanism is devised to
improve the scalability from two aspects: (i) an accelerated distributed

(ii) a novel selection strategy to reduce the amount of computation and
communication per prosumer. Finally, the convergence proof of the proposed
accelerated algorithm is given, and the proposed selection strategy is
illustrated through a Monte Carlo simulation experiment.

In 2020, the mortality rate of melanoma rose to 1.9 per 100 000 habitants.
Melanoma prognosis is based on a pathologist's subjective visual analysis of

prognosis variability among experts is notable, drastically jeopardizing its
reproducibility. Thus, the need for faster and more reproducible methods
arises. Machine learning has paved its way into digital pathology, but so far,
most contributions are on localization, segmentation, and diagnostics, with
little emphasis on prognostics. This paper presents a convolutional neural
network (CNN) method based on VGG16 to predict melanoma prognosis as the
presence of metastasis within five years. Patches are extracted from regions of
interest from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at different magnification levels used
in model training and validation. Results infer that utilizing WSI patches at

These spiral arms
can be excited by companions, either on bound or unbound orbits. We simulate a

periastron passage. We run three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of a
parabolic flyby encountering a gaseous protoplanetary disc. The perturber mass
ranges from $10\, \rm M_J$ to $1\, \rm M_{\odot}$. The perturber excites a
two-armed spiral structure, with a more prominent spiral feature for higher
mass perturbers. The two arms evolve over time, eventually winding up,
consistent with previous works. We focus on analysing the pattern speed and
pitch angle of these spirals during the whole process. The initial pattern
speed of the two arms are close to the angular velocity of the perturber at
periastron, and then it decreases over time. The pitch angle also decreases
over time as the spiral winds up. The spirals disappear after several local
orbital times. An inclined prograde orbit flyby induces similar disc
substructures as a coplanar flyby. A solar-mass flyby event causes increased
eccentricity growth in the protoplanetary disc, leading to an eccentric disc
structure which dampens over time. The spirals' morphology and the disc
eccentricity can be used to search for potential unbound stars or planets
around discs where a flyby is suspected. Future disc observations at high
resolution and dedicated surveys will help to constrain the frequency of such
stellar encounters in nearby star-forming regions.

problems. However, one major limitation is the slow inference time. While
faster diffusion samplers have been developed for unconditional sampling, there
has been limited research on conditional sampling in the context of inverse
problems. In this study, we propose a novel and efficient diffusion sampling
strategy that employs the geometric decomposition of diffusion sampling.
Specifically, we discover that the samples generated from diffusion models can
be decomposed into two orthogonal components: a ``denoised"" component obtained
by projecting the sample onto the clean data manifold, and a ``noise"" component
that induces a transition to the next lower-level noisy manifold with the
addition of stochastic noise. Furthermore, we prove that, under some conditions
on the clean data manifold, the conjugate gradient update for imposing
conditioning from the denoised signal belongs to the clean manifold, resulting
in a much faster and more accurate diffusion sampling. Our method is applicable
regardless of the parameterization and setting (i.e., VE, VP). Notably, we
achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on challenging real-world
medical inverse imaging problems, including multi-coil MRI reconstruction and
3D CT reconstruction. Moreover, our proposed method achieves more than 80 times

achieve? To answer these questions, we propose an effective Trojan attack
against diffusion models, TrojDiff, which optimizes the Trojan diffusion and
generative processes during training. In particular, we design novel
transitions during the Trojan diffusion process to diffuse adversarial targets
into a biased Gaussian distribution and propose a new parameterization of the
Trojan generative process that leads to an effective training objective for the
attack. In addition, we consider three types of adversarial targets: the
Trojaned diffusion models will always output instances belonging to a certain
class from the in-domain distribution (In-D2D attack), out-of-domain
distribution (Out-D2D-attack), and one specific instance (D2I attack). We
evaluate TrojDiff on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets against both DDPM and DDIM

under different adversarial targets using different types of triggers, while
the performance in benign environments is preserved. The code is available at

  We show that traditional computer vision algorithms for edge and corner

corners of a typical paper receipt in real-world settings. This is particularly
the case when the colors of the receipt and background are similar, or where
other interfering rectangular objects are present. Inaccurate detection of a
receipt's corner positions then results in distorted images when using an
affine projective transformation to rectify the perspective.
  We propose an innovative solution to receipt corner detection by treating
each of the four corners as a unique ""object"", and training a Single Shot
Detection MobileNet object detection model. We use a small amount of real data
and a large amount of automatically generated synthetic data that is designed
to be similar to real-world imaging scenarios.
  We show that our proposed method robustly detects the four corners of a
receipt, giving a receipt detection accuracy of 85.3% on real-world data,
compared to only 36.9% with a traditional edge detection-based approach. Our
method works even when the color of the receipt is virtually indistinguishable
from the background.
  Moreover, our method is trained to detect only the corners of the central
target receipt and implicitly learns to ignore other receipts, and other
rectangular objects. Including synthetic data allows us to train an even better

Recently,
many approaches have been proposed to automatically recommend method names and

mostly trained from scratch, learning two different objectives simultaneously.
The misalignment between two objectives will negatively affect training
efficiency and model performance. 2) The enclosing class context is not fully
exploited, making it difficult to learn the abstract function of the method. 3)
Current method name consistency checking methods follow a generate-then-compare
process, which restricts the accuracy as they highly rely on the quality of
generated names and face difficulty measuring the semantic consistency.
  In this paper, we propose an approach named AUMENA to AUtomate MEthod NAming
tasks with context-aware prompt-tuning. Unlike existing deep learning based
approaches, our model first learns the contextualized representation(i.e.,
class attributes) of PL and NL through the pre-training model, then fully
exploits the capacity and knowledge of large language model with prompt-tuning
to precisely detect inconsistent method names and recommend more accurate
names. To better identify semantically consistent names, we model the method
name consistency checking task as a two-class classification problem, avoiding
the limitation of previous similarity-based consistency checking approaches.

from statistical learning research have been contradicting whether the Scouting
combine is a useful metric for player success. In this study, we investigate if
machine learning can be used to determine matriculation and future success in
the NFL. Using Scouting Combine data, we evaluate six different algorithms'
ability to predict whether a potential draft pick will play a single NFL snap
(matriculation). If a player is drafted, we predict how many snaps they go on
to play (success). We are able to predict matriculation with 83% accuracy;
however, we are unable to predict later success. Our best performing algorithm
returns large error and low explained variance (RMSE=1,210 snaps;
${R}^2$=0.17). These findings indicate that while the Scouting Combine can
predict NFL matriculation, it may not be a reliable predictor of long-term

its accuracy diminishes significantly in a few-shot setting. To address this

the radiance fields with very few number of input views, without incorporating
additional priors. Basically, we train our model under the supervision of
reference and unseen views simultaneously in an iterative procedure. In each
iteration, we label unseen views with the predicted colors or warped pixels
generated by the model from the preceding iteration. However, these expanded
pseudo-views are afflicted by imprecision in color and warping artifacts, which
degrades the performance of NeRF. To alleviate this issue, we construct an
uncertainty-aware NeRF with specialized embeddings. Some techniques such as
cone entropy regularization are further utilized to leverage the pseudo-views

verified that our Self-NeRF is robust to input with uncertainty and surpasses
existing methods when trained on limited training data.

arise from a delicate interplay of material properties, local anisotropy,
curvature, and connectivity. A particularly interesting magnetic lattice that
combines these aspects is that of nanoscale gyroids, with a
highly-interconnected chiral network with local three-connectivity reminiscent
of three-dimensional artificial spin ices. Here, we use finite-element
micromagnetic simulations to elucidate the anisotropic behaviour of nanoscale
nickel gyroid networks at applied fields and at remanence. We simplify the
description of the micromagnetic spin states with a macrospin model to explain
the anistropic global response, to quantify the extent of ice-like
correlations, and to discuss qualitative features of the anisotropic
magnetoresistance in the three-dimensional network. Our results demonstrate the
large variability of the magnetic order in extended gyroid networks, which
might enable future spintronic functionalities, including neuromorphic
computing and non-reciprocal transport.

around the world, aim to collect data representative of the free troposphere
and of an intercontinental scale. However, the high-altitude environment
favours vertical mixing and the transportation of air masses at local or
regional scales, which has a potential influence on the composition of the
sampled air masses. Mixing processes, source-receptor pathways, and atmospheric
chemistry may strongly depend on local and regional weather regimes, and these
should be characterized specifically for each station. The Pic du Midi (PDM)
isa mountaintop observatory (2850 m a.s.l.) on the north side of the Pyrenees.
PDM is associated with the Centre de Recherches Atmosph{\'e}riques (CRA), a
site in the foothills ar 600 m a.s.l. 28 km north-east of the PDM. The two
centers make up the Pyrenean Platform for the Observation of the Atmosphere
(P2OA). Data measured at PDM and CRA were combined to form a5-year hourly
dataset of 23 meteorological variables notably: temperature, humidity, cloud
cover, wind at several altitudes. The dataset was classified using hierarchical
clustering, with the aim of grouping together the days which had similar
meteorological characteristics. To complete the clustering, we computed several
diagnostic tools, in order to provide additional information and study specific
phenomena (foehn, precipitation, atmospheric vertical structure, and thermally
driven circulations). This classification resulted in six clusters: three
highly populated clusters which correspond to the most frequent meteorological
conditions (fair weather, mixed weather and disturbed weather, respectively); a
small cluster evidencing clear characteristics of winter northwesterly
windstorms; and two small clusters characteristic of south foehn (south- to
southwesterly large-scaleflow, associated with warm and dry downslope flow on
the lee side of the chain). The diagnostic tools applied to the six clusters
provided results in line with the conclusions tentatively drawn from 23
meteorological variables. This, to some extent,validates the approach of
hierarchical clustering of local data to distinguish weather regimes. Then
statistics of atmospheric composition at PDM were analysed and discussed for
each cluster. Radon measurements, notably, revealed that the regional
background in the lower troposphere dominates the influence of diurnal thermal
flows when daily averaged concentrations are considered. Differences between
clusters were demonstrated by the anomalies of CO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, O$_3$ and
aerosol number concentration, and interpretations in relation with chemical

signatures that can impact the interpretation of results in galaxy survey
experiments, such as cosmological parameter estimations and gravity model
tests. Because of this, it is important to investigate astrophysical
observables that can break these degeneracies. Cosmic voids are sensitive to
both massive neutrinos and modifications of gravity and provide a promising
ground for disentangling the above mentioned degeneracies. In order to analyse
cosmic voids in the context of non-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, we must first
understand how well the current theoretical framework operates in these
settings. We perform a suite of simulations with the RAMSES-based N-body code
ANUBISIS, including massive neutrinos and $f(R)$ modified gravity both
individually and simultaneously. The data from the simulations is compared to
models of the void velocity profile and the void-halo cross-correlation
function (CCF). This is done both with the real space simulation data as model
input and by applying a reconstruction method to the redshift space data. In
addition, we run Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits on the data sets to
assess the capability of the models to reproduce the fiducial simulation values
of $f\sigma_8(z)$ and the Alcock-Paczy\`{n}ski parameter, $\epsilon$. The void
modelling applied performs similarly for all simulated cosmologies, indicating
that more accurate models and higher resolution simulations are needed in order
to directly observe the effects of massive neutrinos and $f(R)$ modified
gravity through studies of the void-galaxy CCF. The MCMC fits show that the
choice of void definition plays an important role in the recovery of the
correct cosmological parameters, but otherwise no clear distinction between the
ability to reproduce $f\sigma_8$ and $\epsilon$ for the various simulations.

costly simulations is impractical. Therefore, replacing the model $y$ with a
surrogate model $y_s$ that can be evaluated quickly leads to a significant
speedup. The approximation quality of the surrogate model depends strongly on
the number, position, and accuracy of the sample points. With an additional
finite computational budget, this leads to a problem of (computer) experimental
design. In contrast to the selection of sample points, the trade-off between
accuracy and effort has hardly been studied systematically. We therefore
propose an adaptive algorithm to find an optimal design in terms of position
and accuracy. Pursuing a sequential design by incrementally appending the
computational budget leads to a convex and constrained optimization problem. As
a surrogate, we construct a Gaussian process regression model. We measure the
global approximation error in terms of its impact on the accuracy of the
identified parameter and aim for a uniform absolute tolerance, assuming that
$y_s$ is computed by finite element calculations. A priori error estimates and
a coarse estimate of computational effort relate the expected improvement of
the surrogate model error to computational effort, resulting in the most
efficient combination of sample point and evaluation tolerance. We also allow
for improving the accuracy of already existing sample points by continuing
previously truncated finite element solution procedures.

its potential use in important applications, including Virtual Reality. We

important applications of the Boltzmann equation. Recently some important
classical properties of the linearized collision operator for monatomic single
species were extended to multicomponent monatomic gases and polyatomic single
species. For multicomponent polyatomic gases, the case where the polyatomicity
is modelled by a discrete internal energy variable was considered lately. Here
we considers the corresponding case for a continuous internal energy variable.
Compactness results, saying that the linearized operator can be decomposed into
a sum of a positive multiplication operator, the collision frequency, and a
compact operator, bringing e.g., self-adjointness, is extended from the
classical result for monatomic single species, under reasonable assumptions on
the collision kernel. With a probabilistic formulation of the collision
operator as a starting point, the compactness property is shown by a
decomposition, such that the terms are, or at least are uniform limits of,
Hilbert-Schmidt integral operators and therefore are compact operators.
Moreover, bounds on - including coercivity of - the collision frequency are
obtained for a hard sphere like, as well as hard potentials with cutoff like,
models, from which Fredholmness of the linearized collision operator follows,
as well as its domain.

non-Markovian due to the memory effect. An open question is to quantitatively
explain how self-propulsion particles with directional memory diffuse in such a
medium. Based on simulations and analytic theory, we address this issue with
active viscoelastic systems where an active particle is connected with multiple
semi-flexible filaments. Our Langevin dynamics simulations show that the active
cross-linker displays super- and sub-diffusive athermal motion with a
time-dependent anomalous exponent $\alpha$. In such viscoelastic feedback, the
active particle always has superdiffusion with $\alpha=3/2$ at times shorter
than the self-propulsion time ($\tau_A$). At times greater than $\tau_A$, the
subdiffusion emerges with $\alpha$ bounded between $1/2$ and $3/4$. Remarkably,
the active subdiffusion is reinforced as the active propulsion (Pe) is more
vigorous. In the high-Pe limit, the athermal fluctuation in the stiff filament
eventually leads to $\alpha=1/2$, which can be misinterpreted with the thermal
Rouse motion in a flexible chain. We demonstrate that the motion of active
particles cross-linking a network of semi-flexible filaments can be governed by
a fractional Langevin equation combined with fractional Gaussian noise and an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise. We analytically derive the velocity autocorrelation
function and mean-squared displacement of the model, explaining their scaling
relations as well as the prefactors. We find that there exist the threshold Pe
($\mathrm{Pe}^*$) and cross-over times ($\tau^*$ and $\tau^\dagger$) above

  crystals' fundamental building blocks",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Brittle topologically close-packed precipitates form in many advanced alloys.
Due to their complex structures little is known about their plasticity. Here,
we present a strategy to understand and tailor the deformability of these
complex phases by considering the Nb-Co {\mu}-phase as an archetypal material.
The plasticity of the Nb-Co {\mu}-phase is controlled by the Laves phase
building block that forms parts of its unit cell. We find that between the bulk
C15-NbCo$_2$ Laves and Nb-Co {\mu}-phase, the interplanar spacing and local
elastic modulus of the Laves phase building block change, leading to a strong
reduction in hardness and elastic modulus, as well as a transition from
synchroshear to crystallographic slip. Furthermore, as the composition changes
from Nb$_6$Co$_7$ to Nb$_7$Co$_6$, the Co atoms in the triple layer are
substituted such that the triple layer of the Laves phase building block
becomes a slab of pure Nb, resulting in inhomogeneous changes in elasticity and
a transition from crystallographic slip to a glide-and-shuffle mechanism. These
findings open opportunities to purposefully tailor the plasticity of these
topologically close-packed phases in bulk, but at the atomic scale of
interplanar spacing and local shear modulus of the fundamental crystal building
blocks in their large unit cells.

overcome limitations of classical machine learning and neural networks. This is
a field of research which can prove that quantum computers are able to solve
problems with complex correlations between inputs that can be hard for
classical computers. This suggests that learning models made on quantum
computers may be more powerful for applications, potentially faster computation
and better generalization on less data. The objective of this paper is to
investigate how training of quantum neural network (QNNs) can be done using
quantum optimization algorithms for improving the performance and time
complexity of QNNs. A classical neural network can be partially quantized to
create a hybrid quantum-classical neural network which is used mainly in
classification and image recognition. In this paper, a QNN structure is made
where a variational parameterized circuit is incorporated as an input layer
named as Variational Quantum Neural Network (VQNNs). We encode the cost
function of QNNs onto relative phases of a superposition state in the Hilbert
space of the network parameters. The parameters are tuned with an iterative
quantum approximate optimisation (QAOA) mixer and problem hamiltonians. VQNNs
is experimented with MNIST digit recognition (less complex) and crack image
classification datasets (more complex) which converges the computation in
lesser time than QNN with decent training accuracy.

deformation induced damage formation during forming in the constituent phases
but importantly also where these intersect. To capture damage in terms of the
physical processes in three dimensions (3D) and its stochastic nature during
deformation, two challenges remain to be tackled: First, bridging high
resolution analysis towards large scales to consider statistical data and,
second, characterising in 3D with a resolution appropriate for sub-micron sized
voids at a large scale. Here, we present how this can be achieved using
panoramic scanning electron microscopy (SEM), metallographic serial sectioning,
and deep-learning assisted automatic image analysis. This brings together the
3D evolution of active damage mechanisms with volumetric and environmental
information for thousands of individual damage sites. We also assess potential
surface preparation artefacts in 2D analyses. Overall, we find that for the
material considered here, a dual phase (DP800) steel, martensite cracking is
the dominant but not sole origin of deformation induced damage and that for a
quantitative comparison of damage density, metallographic preparation can
induce additional surface damage density far exceeding what is commonly induced
between uniaxial straining steps.

phenomena. However, extra care must be paid in realistic experiments involving
an in-plane magnetic field, because trivial orbital effect due to, e.g.,
rippled structures can inevitably be introduced, which could produce false
effect confusing the expected physical phenomena. In this work, we report a
diamond-shaped evolution of the critical supercurrent in an in-plane magnetic
field in NbTiN weak-link Josephson junctions. Upon application of an in-plane
magnetic field perpendicular to the current, the superconducting interference
pattern exhibits a characteristic evolution, which manifests as a diamond block
diagram featured with each node opened and stretched out in a V-shape,
mimicking the suppression-recovery patterns of critical supercurrent related to
the Zeeman-driven 0-pi transition. However, the effect of Zeeman splitting
plays a negligible role due to the relatively small magnetic field involved in
our experiment. Therefore, we explore the trivial orbital effect of rippled
structures and further take into account non-uniform current distributions
pertaining in our junctions. We find that the ripples in combination with
specific current distributions can give rise to a similar evolution pattern as
the experimental observations. Our results serve as a caution that the combined
effect of rippled structures and non-homogeneous current distributions should
be taken seriously for experiments subjected by in-plane magnetic fields.

common envelope evolution (CEE) with giant stars might launch jets even when
the accreted gas has a sub-Keplerian specific angular momentum. I first show
that after a main sequence star enters the envelope of a giant star the
specific angular momentum of the accreted gas is sub-Keplerian but still
sufficiently large for the accreted gas to avoid two conical-like openings
along the two opposite polar directions. I suggest that the high-pressure zone
that the accreted gas builds around the main sequence equatorial plane
accelerates outflows along these polar opening. Most of the inflowing gas is
deflected to the polar outflows, now turning to two opposite jets. The actual
mass that the main sequence star accretes is only a small fraction, ~0.1, of
the inflowing gas. However, the gravitational energy that this gas releases
powers the inflow-outflow streaming of gas and adds energy to the common
envelope ejection. This flow structure might take place during a grazing
envelope evolution if occurs, during the early CEE, and possibly in some
post-CEE cases. This study increases the parameter space for main sequence
stars to launch jets in shaping some planetary nebulae, in adding energy to
mass removal in CEE, and in powering some intermediate luminosity optical
transients.

Elastic-Piezoelectric-Elastic design with a local damping acting only on the
piezoelectric layer and (ii) a serially-connected Piezoelectric-Elastic design
with a local damping acting on the elastic part only. Unlike the existing
literature, piezoelectric layers are considered magnetizable, and therefore, a
fully-dynamic PDE model, retaining interactions of electromagnetic fields (due
to Maxwell's equations) with the mechanical vibrations, is considered. The
design (i) is shown to have exponentially stable solutions. However, the nature
of the stability of solutions of the design (ii), whether it is polynomial or
exponential, is dependent entirely upon the arithmetic nature of a quotient
involving all physical parameters. Furthermore, a polynomial decay rate is
provided in terms of a measure of irrationality of the quotient. Note that this
type of result is totally new (see Theorem 3.6 and Condition
$\rm{\mathbf{(H_{Pol})}}$). The main tool used throughout the paper is the
multipliers technique which requires an adaptive selection of cut-off functions

cross-domain tasks recently. Though preliminary progress has been made, the
performance gap between the UDA-based 3D model and the supervised one trained
with fully annotated target domain is still large. This motivates us to
consider selecting partial-yet-important target data and labeling them at a
minimum cost, to achieve a good trade-off between high performance and low
annotation cost. To this end, we propose a Bi-domain active learning approach,
namely Bi3D, to solve the cross-domain 3D object detection task. The Bi3D first
develops a domainness-aware source sampling strategy, which identifies
target-domain-like samples from the source domain to avoid the model being
interfered by irrelevant source data. Then a diversity-based target sampling
strategy is developed, which selects the most informative subset of target
domain to improve the model adaptability to the target domain using as little
annotation budget as possible. Experiments are conducted on typical
cross-domain adaptation scenarios including cross-LiDAR-beam, cross-country,

accuracy (89.63% on KITTI) compared with UDAbased work (84.29%), even

spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves corresponding to modes that
re-enter the Hubble horizon at the post-electroweak symmetry breaking epoch,
well within the radiation domination era. Our main assumption is the existence
of an extremely weakly coupled hidden sector between the Higgs and the axion,
materialized by higher order non-renormalizable dimension six and dimension
eight operators, active at a scale M of the order 20-100TeV. This new physics
scale M which is way higher than the electroweak scale, is motivated by the
lack of new particle observations in the large hadron collider to date, beyond
the electroweak scale. Once the electroweak symmetry breaking occurs at T\sim
100 GeV, the axion potential acquires a new minimum due to the new terms
generated by the electroweak breaking, and the axion oscillations at the origin
are destabilized. In effect after some considerable amount of time, the axion
rolls swiftly to its new minimum, experiencing a short kination epoch, where
its energy density redshifts as $\rho_a\sim a^{-6}$. After it reaches the new
minimum, since the latter is energetically less favorable that the Higgs
minimum, it decays to the Higgs minimum and the Universe is described again by
the Higgs minimum. The axion returns to the origin and commences again
oscillations initiated by quantum fluctuations, redshifts as dark matter, and
the same procedure is repeated perpetually. These short axion kination eras may
disturb the background total equation of state parameter during the radiation
domination era. As we show, the energy spectrum of the gravitational waves
mainly depends on how many times the short axion kination epochs occur.

the $f(Q)$ gravity of symmetric teleparallel theory equivalent to the GR

the power law model, $f(Q) = -\, \alpha Q^n$ with two constant parameters
$\alpha$ and $n$. Considering a proportionality relation between the
directional Hubble parameters with a proportionality constant parameter
$\lambda$ we find a significant contribution of the anisotropic factor in the

more dominating effect of anisotropy in comparison to the simple model
depending on model parameters, especially on the parameter $n$. The power law

popular approaches in non-life insurance mathematics. Proposed to determine the
first two moments of the reserve, it does not allow to identify the whole
distribution of the reserve. For this purpose, Mack's model is usually equipped
with a tailor-made bootstrap procedure. Although widely used in practice to
estimate the reserve risk, no theoretical bootstrap consistency results exist
that justify this approach. To fill this gap in the literature, we adopt the
framework proposed by Steinmetz and Jentsch (2022) to derive asymptotic theory
in Mack's model. By splitting the reserve into two parts corresponding to
process and estimation uncertainty, this enables - for the first time - a
rigorous investigation also of the validity of the Mack bootstrap. We prove
that the (conditional) distribution of the asymptotically dominating process
uncertainty part is correctly mimicked by Mack's bootstrap if the parametric
family of distributions of the individual development factors is correctly
specified. Otherwise, this is not the case. In contrast, the (conditional)
distribution of the estimation uncertainty part is generally not correctly
captured by Mack's bootstrap. To tackle this, we propose an alternative
Mack-type bootstrap, which is designed to capture also the distribution of the
estimation uncertainty part. We illustrate our findings by simulations and show
that the newly proposed alternative Mack bootstrap performs superior to the
Mack bootstrap.

the belt will also be visited by Lucy: 152830 Dinkinesh (1999 VD57). The main
goal of this work is to characterise this newly selected target, asteroid
Dinkinesh, in order to provide critical information to the mission team. To
achieve it, we have obtained visible spectra, colour photometry, and
time-series photometry of Dinkinesh, using several telescopes located at
different observatories. For the spectra we used the 10.4m Gran Telescopio
Canarias (GTC), in the island of La Palma (Spain); for the colour photometry
the 4.3m Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT), near Happy Jack, Arizona (USA) was
used; and for the time-series photometry we used the 82cm IAC80 telescope
located in the island of Tenerife (Spain). Both visible spectrum and
reflectance values computed from colour photometry show that Dinkinesh is an
S-type asteroid, i.e., it is composed mainly of silicates and some metal.
According to observations done by the NEOWISE survey, S-type asteroids have
typical geometric albedo of $p_V$ = 0.223 $\pm$ 0.073. From our time-series
photometry, we obtained an asteroid mean magnitude $r'$ = 19.99 $\pm$ 0.05,
which provides an absolute magnitude $H_{r'}$ = 17.53 $\pm$ 0.07 assuming $G$ =
0.19 $\pm$ 0.25 for S-types. Using our colour-photometry, we transformed
$H_{r'}$ to $H_V$ = 17.48 $\pm$ 0.05. This value of absolute magnitude combined
with the geometric albedo provides a mean diameter for Dinkinesh of $\sim$900
m, ranging between a minimum size of 542 m and a maximum size of 1309 m.

$\gamma$-rays, have been claimed to be an extragalactic magnetar giant flare
(MGF) whose proposed host galaxy is the nearby ${\mathrm{NGC} \, 253}$.
However, as the redshift of the transient object was not measured, it is
possible that the measured location of the transient on the celestial sphere
and the location of the local galaxy merely coincided. Thus, its real
progenitor could have been arbitrarily far away, leading possibly to a much
larger luminosity of the transient, and leaving the standard model of short
gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), the merger of two compact objects, as an explanation
for the observations.
  Aims. In this study, our aim is to compute the false-alarm rate for the
misinterpretation of sGRBs as magnetars in a given observation period.
  Methods. We simulate synthetic surveys of sGRB observations in a time period
of 14 years corresponding to the operation period of the Gamma-ray Burst
Monitor (GBM) detector. For all sGRBs that align on the sky with a nearby Local
Volume galaxy, we generate realistic data which is folded through the response
of the GBM. To identify candidates of sGRBs that may be misinterpreted as
magnetars, six selections (spatial, star formation rate, GBM trigger, duration,
isotropic energy release, and fluence) are applied to the simulated surveys.
  Results. In a non-negligible fraction, 15.7 %, of the simulated surveys, we
identify at least one sGRB that has the same characteristics as a magnetar
giant flare and could be thus misinterpreted as magnetar. Thus, we conclude
that the selections that were proposed in previous work to unambiguously
identify an extragalactic magnetar giant flare are not sufficient.

from a source domain to a target domain with different data distributions.
Traditional domain adaptation methods presume that the classes in the source
and target domains are identical, which is not always the case in real-world
scenarios. Open-set domain adaptation (OSDA) addresses this limitation by
allowing previously unseen classes in the target domain. Open-set domain
adaptation aims to not only recognize target samples belonging to common
classes shared by source and target domains but also perceive unknown class
samples. We propose a novel framework based on self-paced learning to
distinguish common and unknown class samples precisely, referred to as SPLOS
(self-paced learning for open-set). To utilize unlabeled target samples for
self-paced learning, we generate pseudo labels and design a cross-domain mixup
method tailored for OSDA scenarios. This strategy minimizes the noise from
pseudo labels and ensures our model progressively learns common class features
of the target domain, beginning with simpler examples and advancing to more
complex ones. Furthermore, unlike existing OSDA methods that require manual
hyperparameter $threshold$ tuning to separate common and unknown classes, our
approach self-tunes a suitable threshold, eliminating the need for empirical
tuning during testing. Comprehensive experiments illustrate that our method
consistently achieves superior performance on different benchmarks compared
with various state-of-the-art methods.

where the plane structure approximates 3D scenes concisely. Conveying RGBA
contexts with geometrically-faithful structures, the S-MPI directly bridges
view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. It can not only overcome the critical
limitations of MPI, i.e., discretization artifacts from sloped surfaces and
abuse of redundant layers, and can also acquire planar 3D reconstruction.
Despite the intuition and demand of applying S-MPI, great challenges are
introduced, e.g., high-fidelity approximation for both RGBA layers and plane
poses, multi-view consistency, non-planar regions modeling, and efficient
rendering with intersected planes. Accordingly, we propose a transformer-based
network based on a segmentation model. It predicts compact and expressive S-MPI

Multi-view consistency is ensured by sharing global proxy embeddings, which

interacting hands. Thus, based on center attention, ACR also learns cross-hand

various types of hand reconstruction datasets. Our method significantly
outperforms the best interacting-hand approaches on the InterHand2.6M dataset

at constant interarrival times, but each customer actual arrival time is
perturbed from her scheduled arrival time by a random perturbation. The
sequence of perturbations is independent and identically distributed. It has
previously been shown that the arrival counting process for scheduled traffic
obeys a functional central limit theorem (FCLT) with fractional Brownian motion
(fBM) with Hurst parameter H strictly between 0 and 1/2 when the pertubratons
have a Pareto-like tail with tail exponent lying in (0,1). Such limit processes
exhibit less variability than Brownian motion, because the scheduling feature
induces negative correlations in the arrival process. In this paper, we show
that when the tail of the perturbations have a super-heavy tail, the FCLT limit
process is Brownian motion (i.e. H=1/2), so that the heaviness of the tails
eliminates any remaining negative correlations and generates a limit process
with independent increments. We further study the case when the perturbations

consideration are expressions for the diffraction orders amplitudes, which
coincide with the expressions obtained in the Raman-Nath theory of light
scattering by ultrasonic waves. The paper compares expressions for the
amplitude of the first order of diffraction, obtained in the framework of
several theoretical approaches, including perturbation theory in a rigorous

multiple observers, but they are currently restricted to local measurements and
unsuitable for nonlocal-measurement-based tasks. In this work, we propose an
effective method for constructing optimal nonlocal measurements using quantum
ellipsoids to share quantum steering. This method is applicable to any
bipartite state and advantageous even when the number of measurement settings
is large. Taking the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state as an example, we
demonstrate that unsharp nonlocal product measurements can activate steering
sharing compared with local measurements. Furthermore, our results indicate
that the activation ability of unequal-strength nonlocal measurements is
stronger than that of equal-strength ones. Unlike previous activation methods,
ours does not require increasing the copy number of the shared states or
weakening other types of quantum correlations, making it both
experiment-friendly and resource-reusable.

changes, existing methods struggle to generalize well for unseen domains. In
this paper, we systematically address the domain shift problem in the rPPG
measurement task. We show that most domain generalization methods do not work
well in this problem, as domain labels are ambiguous in complicated
environmental changes. In light of this, we propose a domain-label-free
approach called NEuron STructure modeling (NEST). NEST improves the
generalization capacity by maximizing the coverage of feature space during
training, which reduces the chance for under-optimized feature activation
during inference. Besides, NEST can also enrich and enhance domain invariant
features across multi-domain. We create and benchmark a large-scale domain
generalization protocol for the rPPG measurement task. Extensive experiments
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both

differs from traditional deep learning networks, as it involves learning to
locate displacement field discontinuities by matching features at various
locations in the reference and deformed images. An image library representing
the diversified cracking behavior of AC was developed for supervised training.
CrackPropNet achieved an optimal dataset scale F-1 of 0.755 and optimal image
scale F-1 of 0.781 on the testing dataset at a running speed of 26
frame-per-second. Experiments demonstrated that low to medium-level Gaussian
noises had a limited impact on the measurement accuracy of CrackPropNet.
Moreover, the model showed promising generalization on fundamentally different

crack patterns accurately and efficiently in AC cracking tests. It can be
applied to characterize the cracking phenomenon, evaluate AC cracking

the amplitudes of these excitations, but they are typically insensitive to
phase. Therefore, novel methods with phase sensitivity are required to
understand ground states with phase modulations and interactions that couple to
the phase of collective modes. Here, by performing phase-resolved coherent
phonon spectroscopy (CPS), we reveal a hidden spin-lattice coupling in a vdW
antiferromagnet FePS$_{3}$ that eluded other phase-insensitive conventional

analytical calculations, we directly show that the magnetic order in FePS$_{3}$
selectively couples to the trigonal distortions through partially filled

lattice parameters, rendering these distortions inaccessible to inelastic
scattering techniques. Our results not only capture the elusive spin-lattice

challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of
partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We
introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the
union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D
geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do
so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union
operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated

perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a
database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with
eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,
and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this
operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can
generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long

However, multi-timescale electricity, hydrogen, and ammonia storages, minimum
power supply for system safety, and the multi-year uncertainty of renewable
generation lead to difficulties in planning. To address the issues above, an
IGDT-MILFP model is proposed. First, the levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) is
directly formulated as the objective, rendering a mixed integer linear
fractional programming (MILFP) problem. Information gap decision theory (IGDT)
is utilized to handle the multi-year uncertainty of renewable generation.
Second, a combined Charnes-Cooper (C&C) transformation and Branch-and-Bound

giving robust and opportunistic planning results. Then, Markov Chain Monte

studied. The results indicate that the proposed methods could reduce the
computational burden by orders of magnitude for solving a large-scale MILFP

Recently, work has been done to learn a valid CBF from data based on a

it still requires a large amount of data to train the CBF network. In this
work, we propose a new method to learn more efficiently from the collected data

computed from the loss value of each data point. Then, a probability

valid CBF that recovers a larger portion of the true safe set using a smaller
amount of data. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated in simulation

learnable tokens. Then, alongside the question, these learnable tokens directly
prompt the language model. We explore recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning

fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on the prime medical VQA benchmarks,

Coherent WaveBurst (cWB). This work is part of the long-term effort to mitigate
transient noises in cWB, which led to the introduction of specific estimators,

propose an autoencoder neural network, integrated into cWB, that learns
transient noises morphologies from GW time-series. We test its performance on
the glitch family known as blip. The resulting sensitivity to generic GWT and
binary black hole mergers significantly improves when tested on LIGO detectors
data from the last observation period (O3b). At false alarm rate of one event

similar to blip glitches. In perspective, this tool can adapt to classify
different transient noise classes that may affect future observing runs,
enhancing GWT searches.

promoted by a trade-off among interfacial properties (perpendicular anisotropy
and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)) and dipolar interactions.
Depending on the dominant interaction, complex spin textures, including pure
N\'eel and hybrid skyrmions have been observed in multilayer heterostructures.
A quantification of these different spin textures typically requires a
depth-reoslved magnetic imaging or scattering techniques. In the present work,
we will show qualitatively different collapsing dynamics for pure N\'eel and
hybrid skyrmions induced by a perpendicular magnetic field in two
representative systems, [Pt/Co/Ir]15 and [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15 multilayers.
Skyrmions in the former stack undergo two morphological transitions, upon
reversing the perpendicular field direction. Skyrmions in [Ta/CoFeB/MgO]15
multilayers exhibit a continuous transition, which is mainly linked to a
reversible change of the skyrmion size. A full micromagnetic phase diagram is
presented to identify these two collapsing mechanisms as a function of material
parameters. Since the two distinct collapsing dynamics rely on the detailed
layer-dependent spin structures of skyrmions, they could be used as potential
fingerprints for identifying the skyrmion type in magnetic multilayers. Our
work suggests the employment of pure and hybrid skyrmions for specific
applications, due to the strong correlation between the skyrmion dynamics and
3-dimentional spin profiles.

approach based on a combination of the rare event sampling method called
Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (AMS) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD).
The AMS method requires a one dimensional reaction coordinate to index the
progress of the transition. Identifying a good reaction coordinate is
difficult, especially for high dimensional problems such a those encountered in
catalysis. We probe various approaches to build reaction coordinates such as
Support Vector Machine and path collective variables. The AMS is implemented so
as to communicate with a DFT-plane wave code. A relevant case study in
catalysis: the change of conformation and the dissociation of a water molecule
chemisorbed on the (100) $\gamma$-alumina surface is used to evaluate our
approach. The calculated rate constants and transition mechanisms are discussed
and compared to those obtained by a conventional static approach based on the
Eyring-Polanyi equation with harmonic approximation. It is revealed that the
AMS method may provide rate constants which are smaller than the static
approach by up to two orders of magnitude due to entropic effects involved in
the chemisorbed water.

that satisfy given task specifications, such as input/output pairs or
demonstrations. Recent works have demonstrated encouraging results in a variety
of domains, such as string transformation, tensor manipulation, and describing
behaviors of embodied agents. Most existing program synthesis methods are
designed to synthesize programs from scratch, generating a program token by
token, line by line. This fundamentally prevents these methods from scaling up
to synthesize programs that are longer or more complex. In this work, we
present a scalable program synthesis framework that instead synthesizes a
program by hierarchically composing programs. Specifically, we first learn a
task embedding space and a program decoder that can decode a task embedding
into a program. Then, we train a high-level module to comprehend the task
specification (e.g., input/output pairs or demonstrations) from long programs
and produce a sequence of task embeddings, which are then decoded by the
program decoder and composed to yield the synthesized program. We extensively
evaluate our proposed framework in a string transformation domain with
input/output pairs. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can synthesize programs that are significantly longer and more
complex than the programs considered in prior program synthesis works. Website

overcome the challenge of train the big teacher model in resource limited user

be trained at DT located in the server with enough computing resources. Then,
during model distillation, each user can update the parameters of its model at

formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. To solve the problem,
Q-learning and optimization are jointly used, where Q-learning selects models
for users and determines whether to train locally or on the server, and
optimization is used to allocate resources for users based on the output of
Q-learning. Simulation results show the proposed DT-assisted KD framework and
joint optimization method can significantly improve the average accuracy of
users while reducing the total delay.

integrated different stages within the framework with the Sequential

subsequently observed by the Voyager Spacecraft flybys in the early 1980s, it
was realised that the 'spokes' flare out like spokes on a bicycle wheel. The
observed behaviour of the 'spokes' indicates that they are not governed by
gravitational interactions with the planets, moons, or ring material. In 2005
the Cassini probe confirmed that the 'spokes' are likely under the influence of
the gas giant's global magnetic field. Here we show that the 'spokes' that
appear in Saturn's rings consist of grains of silicates coated in pyrolytic
carbon through the process of Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD). Pyrolytic
carbon is a highly diamagnetic substance that can levitate above a sufficiently
strong magnetic field. The 'spokes' also consist of ice particles that are
diamagnetic as well. The photoelectric effect can be used to explain why the
silicates coated in pyrolytic carbon return to the main ring structure when
exposed to sunlight of a specific frequency. The pyrolytic carbon grains become
paramagnetic when some of the unhybridised 2pz orbitals lose their unpaired
delocalised electrons, thus collapsing the pi bond molecular orbital structure.
The pyrolytic carbon grains are now attracted to the magnetic field emanating
above and below the main ring structure. It is suggested that the 'spokes' in
Saturn's B ring are always present and no plasma triggering event is required
to increase plasma density. The 'spokes', however, are only visible when a
favourable viewing angle is allowed, and their visibility is also dependent on
the angle of the sunlight hitting Saturn's rings.

execute complex tasks. However, learning is incredibly complicated due to the
brain's nonlinear nature and the obscurity of mechanisms for determining the
contribution of each synapse to the output error. This issue is known as the
Credit Assignment Problem (CAP) and is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience
and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Nevertheless, in the current understanding of
cognitive neuroscience, it is widely accepted that a feedback loop systems play
an essential role in synaptic plasticity. With this as inspiration, we propose
a computational model by combining Neural Networks (NN) and nonlinear optimal

projections on the NN's synaptic plasticity so as to ensure that the output

Generally we train a single model on a single task. However, we can train
multiple tasks on a single model under multi-task learning settings. This
provides us many benefits like lesser training time, training a single model
for multiple tasks, reducing overfitting, improving performances etc. To train
a model in multi-task learning settings we need to sum the loss values from
different tasks. In vanilla multi-task learning settings we assign equal
weights but since not all tasks are of similar difficulty we need to allocate
more weight to tasks which are more difficult. Also improper weight assignment
reduces the performance of the model. We propose a simple weight assignment
scheme in this paper which improves the performance of the model and puts more

the resulting singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking that it enabled,
yield a highly general set of conditions under which a spacetime (or, more
generically, a pseudo-Riemannian manifold) is expected to become geodesically
incomplete. It is a non-trivial question to ask whether (and to what extent)
there exist equivalently general conditions under which one expects discrete
spacetimes to become geodesically incomplete, and how these conditions might
differ from those in the continuum. This article builds upon previous work, in
which the conformal and covariant Z4 (CCZ4) formulation of the Cauchy problem
for the Einstein field equations, with constraint-violation damping, was
defined in terms of Wolfram model evolution over discrete (spatial) hypergraphs
for the case of vacuum spacetimes, and proceeds to consider a minimal extension
to the non-vacuum case by introducing a massive scalar field distribution,
defined in either spherical or axial symmetry. Under appropriate assumptions,
this scalar field distribution admits a physical interpretation as a collapsing
(and, in the axially-symmetric case, uniformly rotating) dust, and we are able
to show, through a combination of rigorous mathematical analysis and explicit
numerical simulation, that the resulting discrete spacetimes converge
asymptotically to either non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole solutions or
maximally-rotating (extremal) Kerr black hole solutions, respectively. Although
the assumptions used in obtaining these preliminary results are very strong,
they nevertheless offer hope that a more general, perhaps ultimately
``Penrose-like'', singularity theorem may be provable in the discrete spacetime

shown remarkable capacities in comprehending and producing language. However,
their internal workings remain a black box in cognitive terms, and it is
unclear whether LLMs and chatbots can develop humanlike characteristics in
language use. Cognitive scientists have devised many experiments that probe,
and have made great progress in explaining, how people process language. We
subjected ChatGPT to 12 of these experiments, pre-registered and with 1,000
runs per experiment. In 10 of them, ChatGPT replicated the human pattern of
language use. It associated unfamiliar words with different meanings depending
on their forms, continued to access recently encountered meanings of ambiguous
words, reused recent sentence structures, reinterpreted implausible sentences
that were likely to have been corrupted by noise, glossed over errors, drew
reasonable inferences, associated causality with different discourse entities
according to verb semantics, and accessed different meanings and retrieved
different words depending on the identity of its interlocutor. However, unlike
humans, it did not prefer using shorter words to convey less informative
content and it did not use context to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities. We
discuss how these convergences and divergences may occur in the transformer
architecture. Overall, these experiments demonstrate that LLM-driven chatbots
like ChatGPT are capable of mimicking human language processing to a great
extent, and that they have the potential to provide insights into how people
learn and use language.

paradigm that aims at generating large and diverse collections of solutions,
notably with its flagship algorithm MAP-ELITES (ME) which evolves solutions
through mutations and crossovers. While very effective for some unstructured
problems, early ME implementations relied exclusively on random search to
evolve the population of solutions, rendering them notoriously
sample-inefficient for high-dimensional problems, such as when evolving neural
networks. Follow-up works considered exploiting gradient information to guide
the search in order to address these shortcomings through techniques borrowed
from either Black-Box Optimization (BBO) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). While
mixing RL techniques with ME unlocked state-of-the-art performance for robotics
control problems that require a good amount of exploration, it also plagued
these ME variants with limitations common among RL algorithms that ME was free
of, such as hyperparameter sensitivity, high stochasticity as well as training
instability, including when the population size increases as some components
are shared across the population in recent approaches. Furthermore, existing
approaches mixing ME with RL tend to be tied to a specific RL algorithm, which
effectively prevents their use on problems where the corresponding RL algorithm
fails. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a flexible framework that
allows the use of any RL algorithm and alleviates the aforementioned
limitations by evolving populations of agents (whose definition include
hyperparameters and all learnable parameters) instead of just policies. We
demonstrate the benefits brought about by our framework through extensive

is conducted to understand how to set thresholds for these indicators while
accounting for traffic flow characteristics at different traffic states. This
paper proposes a clustering framework for determining surrogate safety measures
(SSM) thresholds and identifying traffic conflicts in different traffic states
using high-resolution trajectory data from the Citysim dataset. In this study,
unsupervised clustering is employed to identify different traffic states and
their transitions under a three-phase theory framework. The resulting clusters
can then be utilized in conjunction with surrogate safety measures (SSM) to
identify traffic conflicts and assess safety performance in each traffic state.
From different perspectives of time, space, and deceleration, we chose three
compatible conflict indicators: TTC, DRAC, and PSD, considering functional
differences and empirical correlations of different SSMs. A total of three
models were chosen by learning these indicators to identify traffic conflict
and non-conflict clusters. It is observed that Mclust outperforms the other
two. The results show that the distribution of traffic conflicts varies
significantly across traffic states. A wide moving jam (J) is found to be the
phase with largest amount of conflicts, followed by synchronized flow phase (S)
and free flow phase(F). Meanwhile, conflict risk and thresholds exhibit similar
levels across transitional states.

artificial intelligence_AI_natural language generation_NLG_tools may improve
their writing quality. However, it remains unclear to what extent AI-generated
text in these students' writing might lead to higher-quality writing. We
explored 23 Hong Kong secondary school students' attempts to write stories
comprising their own words and AI-generated text. Human experts scored the
stories for dimensions of content, language and organization. We analyzed the
basic organization and structure and syntactic complexity of the stories'
AI-generated text and performed multiple linear regression and cluster
analyses. The results show the number of human words and the number of
AI-generated words contribute significantly to scores. Besides, students can be
grouped into competent and less competent writers who use more AI-generated
text or less AI-generated text compared to their peers. Comparisons of clusters
reveal some benefit of AI-generated text in improving the quality of both
high-scoring students' and low-scoring students' writing. The findings can
inform pedagogical strategies to use AI-generated text for EFL students'
writing and to address digital divides. This study contributes designs of NLG
tools and writing activities to implement AI-generated text in schools.

  sacrificing decentralization?",,"IEEE 24th Conference on Business Informatics; Workshop towards
  Decentralized Governance Design, June 2022",,,"cs.SE cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The potential for blockchain technology to eliminate the middleman and
replace the top down hierarchical model of governance with a system of
distributed cooperation has opened up many new opportunities, as well as
dilemmas. Surpassing the level of acceptance by early tech adopters, the market
of smart contracts is now moving towards wider acceptance from regular (non
tech) users. For this to happen however, smart contract development will have
to overcome certain technical and legal obstacles to bring the code and the
user closer. Guided by notions from contract law and consumer protection we
highlight the information gap that exists between users, legal bodies and the
source code. We present a spectrum of low-code to no-code initiatives that aim
at bridging this gap, promising the potential of higher regulatory acceptance.
Nevertheless, this highlights the so called ""Pitfall of the Trustless Dream"",
because arguably solutions to the information gap tend to make the system more
centralized. In this article, we aim to make a practical contribution of
relevance to the wide-spread adoption of smart contracts and their legal
acceptance by analyzing the evolving practices that bring the user and the code
closer.

  LexGLUE benchmark","Working paper",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Following the hype around OpenAI's ChatGPT conversational agent, the last
straw in the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that
demonstrate emergent unprecedented zero-shot capabilities, we audit the latest
OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, `gpt-3.5-turbo', the first available ChatGPT model, in
the LexGLUE benchmark in a zero-shot fashion providing examples in a templated
instruction-following format. The results indicate that ChatGPT achieves an
average micro-F1 score of 47.6% across LexGLUE tasks, surpassing the baseline
guessing rates. Notably, the model performs exceptionally well in some
datasets, achieving micro-F1 scores of 62.8% and 70.2% in the ECtHR B and
LEDGAR datasets, respectively. The code base and model predictions are
available for review on https://github.com/coastalcph/zeroshot_lexglue.

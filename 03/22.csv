  Detection Models","13 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The performance of convolutional neural networks has continued to improve
over the last decade. At the same time, as model complexity grows, it becomes
increasingly more difficult to explain model decisions. Such explanations may
be of critical importance for reliable operation of human-machine pairing
setups, or for model selection when the ""best"" model among many
equally-accurate models must be established. Saliency maps represent one
popular way of explaining model decisions by highlighting image regions models
deem important when making a prediction. However, examining salience maps at
scale is not practical. In this paper, we propose five novel methods of
leveraging model salience to explain a model behavior at scale. These methods
ask: (a) what is the average entropy for a model's salience maps, (b) how does
model salience change when fed out-of-set samples, (c) how closely does model
salience follow geometrical transformations, (d) what is the stability of model
salience across independent training runs, and (e) how does model salience
react to salience-guided image degradations. To assess the proposed measures on
a concrete and topical problem, we conducted a series of experiments for the
task of synthetic face detection with two types of models: those trained
traditionally with cross-entropy loss, and those guided by human salience when
training to increase model generalizability. These two types of models are
characterized by different, interpretable properties of their salience maps,
which allows for the evaluation of the correctness of the proposed measures. We
offer source codes for each measure along with this paper.

clean reference image. Specifically, we focus on SEM semiconductor defects in
addition to several natural image anomalies. There are well-known methods to
create a simulation of an artificial reference image by its defect specimen. In
this work, we introduce several applications for this capability, that the
simulated reference is beneficial for improving their results. Among these
defect detection methods are classic computer vision applied on
difference-image, supervised deep-learning (DL) based on human labels, and
unsupervised DL which is trained on feature-level patterns of normal reference
images. We show in this study how to incorporate correctly the simulated
reference image for these defect and anomaly detection applications. As our
experiment demonstrates, simulated reference achieves higher performance than
the real reference of an image of a defect and anomaly. This advantage of
simulated reference occurs mainly due to the less noise and geometric
variations together with better alignment and registration to the original
defect background.

many commercial applications. In contrast, superconducting analogs, such as the
superconducting diode effect (SDE), are only starting to be experimentally
explored and pose significant challenges to their theoretical understanding. In
this work we put forth a phenomenological picture of the SDE based on the
generalized Ginzburg-Landau free energy, which includes a Lifshitz invariant as
the hallmark of noncentrosymmetric helical phase of the finite-momentum Cooper
pairs. We reveal that such a Lifshitz invariant drives the SDE in
quasi-two-dimensional systems in an applied magnetic field and cannot be
removed by a gauge transformation, due to the inherently inhomogeneous magnetic
response. For a thin film, the SDE scales with the square of its thickness and
nonlinearly with the strength of the in-plane magnetic field. We derive an
explicit formula that relates the SDE at small magnetic fields to the strength
of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, g-factor, and Fermi energy. For a
noncentrosymmetric Josephson junction, we self-consistently obtain generalized
anharmonic current-phase relation which support the SDE. The transparency of
our approach, which agrees well with experimentally-measured SDE, offers an
important method to study nonreciprocal phenomena, central to superconducting
spintronics and topological superconductivity.

Specifically, we combine two terms: a distortion measuring the deviation from

boundary. For this combination, we consider four ingredients. First, to
represent the metric field, we detail a log-Euclidean high-order metric
interpolation on a curved (straight-edged) mesh. Second, for this metric
interpolation, we detail the first and second derivatives in physical
coordinates. Third, to represent the domain boundaries, we propose an implicit

representation, we obtain the first and second derivatives. The derivatives of
the metric interpolation and the implicit representation allow minimizing the
objective function with Newton's method. For this second-order minimization,
the resulting meshes simultaneously match the curved features of the target
metric and boundary. Matching the metric and the geometry using second-order
optimization is an unprecedented capability in curved (straight-edged)

deformation to the normal bundle from derived algebraic geometry to any
geometric context. The latter is our proposed globalization of a derived
algebraic context, itself a generalization of the theory of simplicial
commutative rings.
  One key difference between a geometric context and ordinary derived algebraic
geometry is that the coordinate ring of an affine object in the former is not
necessarily connective. When constructing generalized blow-ups, this not only
turns out to be remarkably convenient, but also leads to a wider existence
result. Indeed, we show that the derived Rees algebra and the derived blow-up
exist for any affine morphism of stacks in a given geometric context. However,
in general the derived Rees algebra will no longer be connective, hence in
general the derived blow-up will not live in the connective part of the theory.
Unsurprisingly, this can be solved by restricting the input to closed
immersions. The proof of the latter statement uses a derived deformation to the
normal bundle in any given geometric context, which is also of independent
interest.
  Besides the geometric context which extends algebraic geometry, the second
main example of a geometric context will be an extension of analytic geometry.
The latter is a recent construction, and includes many different flavors of
analytic geometry, such as complex analytic geometry, non-archimedean rigid
analytic geometry and analytic geometry over the integers. The present work
thus provides derived blow-ups and a derived deformation to the normal bundle
in all of these, which is expected to have many applications.

We say that a vertex $v \in
V(G)$ is a \v{S}olt\'es vertex in $G$ if $W(G - v) = W(G)$, i.e. the Wiener
index does not change if the vertex $v$ is removed. In 1991, \v{S}olt\'es posed
the problem of identifying all connected graphs $G$ with the property that all
vertices of $G$ are \v{S}olt\'es vertices. The only such graph known to this
day is $C_{11}$. As the original problem appears to be too challenging, several
relaxations were studied: one may look for graphs with at least $k$ \v{S}oltes
vertices; or one may look for $\alpha$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs, i.e. graphs where
the ratio between the number of \v{S}olt\'es vertices and the order of the
graph is at least $\alpha$. Note that the original problem is, in fact, to find
all $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs. We intuitively believe that every $1$-\v{S}olt\'es
graph has to be regular and has to possess a high degree of symmetry.
Therefore, we are interested in regular graphs that contain one or more
\v{S}olt\'es vertices. In this paper, we present several partial results. We
describe a construction that gives rise to an infinite family of cubic
$2$-connected graphs with two \v{S}olt\'es vertices. Moreover, we report that a
computer search on publicly available collections of vertex-transitive graphs
did not reveal any $1$-\v{S}olt\'es graph. We are only able to provide examples
of large $\frac{1}{3}$-\v{S}olt\'es graphs that are obtained by truncating
certain cubic vertex-transitive graphs. This leads us to believe that no
$1$-\v{S}olt\'es graph other than $C_{11}$ exists.

inspired vision sensors that have advanced over conventional cameras in high
dynamic range, low latency and low power consumption, showing great application
potential in many fields. Event cameras are more sensitive to junction leakage
current and photocurrent as they output differential signals, losing the
smoothing function of the integral imaging process in the RGB camera. The
logarithmic conversion further amplifies noise, especially in low-contrast
conditions. Recently, researchers proposed a series of datasets and evaluation
metrics but limitations remain: 1) the existing datasets are small in scale and
insufficient in noise diversity, which cannot reflect the authentic working
environments of event cameras; and 2) the existing denoising evaluation metrics
are mostly referenced evaluation metrics, relying on APS information or manual
annotation. To address the above issues, we construct a large-scale event
denoising dataset (multilevel benchmark for event denoising, E-MLB) for the
first time, which consists of 100 scenes, each with four noise levels, that is
12 times larger than the largest existing denoising dataset. We also propose
the first nonreference event denoising metric, the event structural ratio
(ESR), which measures the structural intensity of given events. ESR is inspired
by the contrast metric, but is independent of the number of events and
projection direction. Based on the proposed benchmark and ESR, we evaluate the
most representative denoising algorithms, including classic and SOTA, and
provide denoising baselines under various scenes and noise levels. The

copiotrophic/oligotrophic and fast/slow-growing microbes, defined using the
characterisation of microbial growth in isolated cultures. The dichotomies are
usually qualitative and/or study-specific, sometimes precluding clear-cut
results interpretation. We are able to interpret microbial dichotomies as life
history strategies by combining ecology theory with Monod curves, a classical
laboratory tool of bacterial physiology. Monod curves relate the specific
growth rate of a microbe with the concentration of a limiting nutrient, and
provide quantities that directly correspond to key ecological parameters in
McArthur and Wilsons r/K selection theory, Tilmans resource competition and
community structure theory and Grimes triangle of life strategies. The
resulting model allows us to reconcile the copiotrophic/oligotrophic and
fast/slow-growing dichotomies as different subsamples of a life history
strategy triangle that also includes r/K strategists. We analyzed some
ecological context by considering the known viable carbon sources for
heterotrophic microbes in the framework of community structure theory. This
partly explains the microbial diversity observed using metagenomics. In sum,
ecology theory in combination with Monod curves can be a unifying quantitative
framework for the study of natural microbial communities, calling for the
integration of modern laboratory and field experiments.

increasingly promising direction, mainly thanks to the recent progress in
speech separation. It performs diarization by first separating the speakers and
then applying voice activity detection (VAD) on each separated stream. In this
work we conduct an in-depth study of SSGD in the conversational telephone
speech (CTS) domain, focusing mainly on low-latency streaming diarization
applications. We consider three state-of-the-art speech separation (SSep)
algorithms and study their performance both in online and offline scenarios,
considering non-causal and causal implementations as well as continuous SSep
(CSS) windowed inference. We compare different SSGD algorithms on two widely
used CTS datasets: CALLHOME and Fisher Corpus (Part 1 and 2) and evaluate both
separation and diarization performance. To improve performance, a novel, causal
and computationally efficient leakage removal algorithm is proposed, which
significantly decreases false alarms. We also explore, for the first time,
fully end-to-end SSGD integration between SSep and VAD modules. Crucially, this
enables fine-tuning on real-world data for which oracle speakers sources are
not available. In particular, our best model achieves 8.8% DER on CALLHOME,
which outperforms the current state-of-the-art end-to-end neural diarization
model, despite being trained on an order of magnitude less data and having
significantly lower latency, i.e., 0.1 vs. 1 seconds. Finally, we also show
that the separated signals can be readily used also for automatic speech

radiative transfer in curved spacetime. A selection of ray-tracing GRRT codes
used within the EHT collaboration is evaluated for accuracy and consistency in
producing a selection of test images, demonstrating that the various methods
and implementations of radiative transfer calculations are highly consistent.
When imaging an analytic accretion model, we find that all codes produce images
similar within a pixel-wise normalized mean squared error (NMSE) of 0.012 in
the worst case. When imaging a snapshot from a cell-based magnetohydrodynamic
simulation, we find all test images to be similar within NMSEs of 0.02, 0.04,

deeply-virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) data has recently been questioned
because of the existence of an infinite set of so-called ''shadow GPDs''
(SGPDs). These SGPDs depend on the process and manifest as multiple solutions
(at a fixed scale $Q^2$) to the inverse problem that needs to be solved to
infer GPDs from DVCS data. SGPDs therefore pose a significant challenge for
extracting GPDs from DVCS data. With this motivation we study the extent to
which QCD evolution can provide constraints on SGPDs. This is possible because
the known classes of SGPDs begin to contribute to observables after evolution,
and can then be constrained (at the input scale $Q^2_0$) by data that has a
finite $Q^2$ range. The impact that SGPDs could have on determining the total
angular momentum, pressure and sheer force distributions, and tomography is
also discussed. Our key finding is that scale evolution, coupled with data over
a wide range of skewness $\xi$ and $Q^2$, can constrain the class of SGPDs that
we studied and potentially make possible the extraction of GPDs from DVCS data
over a limited range in the GPD variables.

H2NC is therefore widespread in cold dense clouds where it is present with an

predicted product branching ratio H2NC/H2CN is very method dependent but values
between 0.5 and 0.8 are the most likely ones. Therefore, both the astronomical
observations and the theoretical calculations support that the reaction C + NH3
is the main source of H2NC in interstellar clouds.

reconstructing high-fidelity 3D shapes from a collection of images. However,
these approaches are limited to closed surfaces as they require the surface to
be represented by a signed distance field. In this paper, we propose NeAT, a
new neural rendering framework that can learn implicit surfaces with arbitrary
topologies from multi-view images. In particular, NeAT represents the 3D
surface as a level set of a signed distance function (SDF) with a validity
branch for estimating the surface existence probability at the query positions.
We also develop a novel neural volume rendering method, which uses SDF and
validity to calculate the volume opacity and avoids rendering points with low
validity. NeAT supports easy field-to-mesh conversion using the classic
Marching Cubes algorithm. Extensive experiments on DTU, MGN, and Deep Fashion
3D datasets indicate that our approach is able to faithfully reconstruct both
watertight and non-watertight surfaces. In particular, NeAT significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the task of open surface
reconstruction both quantitatively and qualitatively.

fusion connections between them in specific layers. Different from previous
work, we apply a point-based 3D branch to extract the LiDAR features, as it
preserves the geometric structure of point clouds. To fuse dense image features

camera-LiDAR fusion module (Bi-CLFM). We instantiate two types of the
bidirectional fusion pipeline, one based on the pyramidal coarse-to-fine

all-pairs field transforms (dubbed CamLiRAFT). On FlyingThings3D, both CamLiPWC

largest telescopes to search for and directly detect new exoplanets using
high-contrast imaging (HCI). Thereby, two scientific goals are of central
interest: First, to study the characteristics of the underlying planet
population and distinguish between different planet formation and evolution
theories. Second, to find and characterize planets in our immediate Solar
neighborhood. Both goals heavily rely on the metric used to quantify planet
detections and non-detections.
  Current standards often rely on several explicit or implicit assumptions
about the noise. For example, it is often assumed that the residual noise after
data post-processing is Gaussian. While being an inseparable part of the
metric, these assumptions are rarely verified. This is problematic as any
violation of these assumptions can lead to systematic biases. This makes it
hard, if not impossible, to compare results across datasets or instruments with
different noise characteristics.
  We revisit the fundamental question of how to quantify detection limits in
HCI. We focus our analysis on the error budget resulting from violated
assumptions. To this end, we propose a new metric based on bootstrapping that
generalizes current standards to non-Gaussian noise. We apply our method to
archival HCI data from the NACO-VLT instrument and derive detection limits for
different types of noise. Our analysis shows that current standards tend to
give detection limit that are about one magnitude too optimistic in the
speckle-dominated regime. That is, HCI surveys may have excluded planets that
can still exist.

coupling, in particular the resulting outflows and their effects on the host
galaxy. These include the presence of shock signatures and the detection of
outflows not only along the radio jet but perpendicular to it in many sources.
Although most of the studies are done via the observation of ionized gas,
molecular gas is also being increasingly observed in outflow, contributing to
the bulk of the mass outflow rate. Even though most radio sources present
outflow kinetic powers that do not reach $1\%\,L_{bol}$, and thus do not seem
to provide an immediate impact on the host galaxy, they act to heat the ISM
gas, preventing star formation, slowing the galaxy mass build-up process and
limiting the stellar mass growth, in a ``maintenance mode"" feedback.

Explorer (IXPE) in October 2022. The measured polarization is below the minimum
detectable polarization of 1.1 per cent (at the 99 per cent confidence level).
Simultaneously, the source was observed with the NICER, NuSTAR and SRG/ART-XC
instruments, which enabled spectral decomposition into a dominant thermal
component and a Comptonized one. The low 2-8 keV polarization of the source did
not allow for strong constraints on the black-hole spin and inclination of the
accretion disc. However, if the orbital inclination of about 36 degrees is
assumed, then the upper limit is consistent with predictions for pure thermal
emission from geometrically thin and optically thick discs. Assuming the
polarization degree of the Comptonization component to be 0, 4, or 10 per cent,
and oriented perpendicular to the polarization of the disc emission (in turn
assumed to be perpendicular to the large scale ionization cone detected in the
optical and radio bands), an upper limit to the polarization of the disc
emission of 0.5, 1.7, or 3.6 per cent, respectively, is found (at the 99 per

the centre of interest for development as it leads to phenomena like re-routing
of the percolation pathways or localized self-heating, which may result in
irreversible damage. In the absence of an experimental technique that can
spatially resolve the current distribution and a nonlinear percolation model
suitable to interpret it, one relies on empirical rules and safety factors to
engineer these materials. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum sensing
technology as a solution to the long standing problem of imaging active current
flow in 2D electrically conductive materials. We report on Bose-Einstein
condensate microscopy (BEC-M) achieving the performance and technology levels
where investigating the dynamic re-distribution of current pathways in
electrically percolating networks becomes feasible. Better measurement and
understanding of the networks can have far reaching consequences. We show that
the current density characterization, combined with existing thermal imaging
methods, will for the first time avoid intermediate assumptions on the link
between thermal and conductive properties in these nonlinear networks. This
will enable testing and modeling individual junction behaviour and hot spot
formation over the network. Investigating reversible and irreversible
mechanisms will aid the development of devices with better macroscopic
performance and higher stability and reliability.

explored the spatio-temporal relationships of leading indicators of hospital
pressure across successive waves of SARS-CoV-2 incidence in England. This
includes an analysis of internet search volume values from Google Trends, NHS
triage calls and online queries, the NHS COVID-19 App, lateral flow devices and
the ZOE App. Data sources were analysed for their feasibility as leading
indicators using linear and non-linear methods; granger causality, cross

temporal and spatial relationships were found for some of the leading
indicators assessed across resurgent waves of COVID-19. Google Trends and NHS

ranging from 5-20 days, whereas an inconsistent relationship was found for the
ZOE app, NHS COVID-19 App, and rapid testing, that diminished with granularity,
showing limited autocorrelation of leads between -7 to 7 days. This work shows
that novel syndromic surveillance data has utility for understanding the
expected hospital burden at fine spatial scales. The analysis shows at low

admissions, though care must be taken in relying on the lead times and

In recent years, spectral methods have gained increasing popularity thanks to
their simplicity and computational efficiency. Spectral methods utilize the
leading eigenspace $U$ of the data matrix and its block submatrices
$U_1,U_2,\ldots, U_n$ to recover the permutations. In this paper, we propose a

aggregating useful information from all the block submatrices and estimates the
latent permutations through $\{U_jM^\top\}_{j\geq 1}$. This modification
overcomes a crucial limitation of the existing methods caused by the repetitive
use of $U_1$ and leads to an improved numerical performance. To establish the
optimality of the proposed method, we carry out a fine-grained spectral

able to create new orders beyond the original lattice. In 2H-NbSe2, one of the
layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), the 3x3 charge order appears in
two-dimensional (2D) layers. Although CDW is usually described by a sine wave,
the spatial distribution within a 2D layer has never been systematically
visualized. Here by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density
functional theory (DFT), we have monitored the evolution of 3x3 CDW along
c-axis and realized a nearly tomography scan of CDW of the topmost layer. The
results show that the strength of 3x3 charge order varies while increasing the
tunneling current. The 3x3 charge order is relatively strong at the outermost
Se level and decreases while probing in between Se and Nb levels.
Interestingly, the 3x3 charge order gets strong again as reaching Nb level but
along with a phase shift. We further calculated the orbital charge

dataset of a deep neural network, the network can be induced to exhibit
malicious behavior during inferences, which poses potential threats to
real-world applications. While they have been intensively studied in
classification, backdoor attacks on semantic segmentation have been largely
overlooked. Unlike classification, semantic segmentation aims to classify every
pixel within a given image. In this work, we explore backdoor attacks on
segmentation models to misclassify all pixels of a victim class by injecting a
specific trigger on non-victim pixels during inferences, which is dubbed
Influencer Backdoor Attack (IBA). IBA is expected to maintain the
classification accuracy of non-victim pixels and misleads classifications of
all victim pixels in every single inference. Specifically, we consider two
types of IBA scenarios, i.e., 1) Free-position IBA: the trigger can be
positioned freely except for pixels of the victim class, and 2) Long-distance
IBA: the trigger can only be positioned somewhere far from victim pixels, given
the possible practical constraint. Based on the context aggregation ability of
segmentation models, we propose techniques to improve IBA for the scenarios.
Concretely, for free-position IBA, we propose a simple, yet effective Nearest
Neighbor trigger injection strategy for poisoned sample creation. For
long-distance IBA, we propose a novel Pixel Random Labeling strategy. Our
extensive experiments reveal that current segmentation models do suffer from
backdoor attacks, and verify that our proposed techniques can further increase
attack performance.

absorption and electron cascades are simulated with transport Monte Carlo;
nonequilibrium kinetics of slow electrons (in the valence and the bottom of the

analytic expressions for the flow, in the limit of infinitely long and thin
tubular membranes. We utilize this solution to formulate the in-plane dynamics
of a pair of pusher-type dipoles along the cylinder surface. We find that a
mutually perpendicular dipole pair generically move together along helical
geodesics. Since the cylindrical geometry breaks the in-plane rotational
symmetry of the membrane, there is a difference in flows along the axial and
transverse directions of the cylinder. This in turn leads to anisotropic
hydrodynamic interaction between the dipoles and is remarkably different from
flat and spherical fluid membranes. In particular, the flow along the compact
direction of the cylinder has a local rigid rotation term (independent of the
angular coordinate but decays along the axis of the cylinder). Due to this
feature of the flow, we observe that the interacting dipole pair initially
situated along the axial direction exhibits an overall drift along the compact
angular direction of the tubular fluid membrane. We find that the drift for the
dipole pair increases linearly with time. Our results are relevant for
non-equilibrium dynamics of motor proteins in tubular membranes arising in

applicability to aligned single objects, we focus on generating complex scenes
with multiple objects, by modeling the compositional nature of 3D scenes. By
devising a 2D layout-based approach for 3D synthesis and implementing a new 3D
field representation with a stronger geometric inductive bias, we have created
a 3D GAN that is both efficient and of high quality, while allowing for a more
controllable generation process. Our evaluations on synthetic 3D-FRONT and
real-world KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our model generates scenes of
improved visual and geometric quality in comparison to previous works.

particles are oblate spheroids of aspect ratio 1.5 and density ratio 1.5. Two
Galileo numbers are considered, namely 111 and 152, for which a single oblate

both cases, a strongly inhomogeneous spatial distribution of the disperse phase
in the form of columnar clusters is observed, with a significantly enhanced
average settling velocity as a consequence. Thus, in contrast to previous
results for spheres, the qualitative difference in the single particle regime
does not result in a qualitatively different behavior of the many-particle
cases. In addition, we have carried out an analysis of pairwise interactions of
particles in the well-known drafting-kissing-tumbling setup, for oblate
spheroids of aspect ratio 1.5 and for spheres. We have varied systematically
the relative initial position between the particle pair and we have considered
free-to-rotate particles and rotationally-locked ones. We have found that the
region of attraction for both particle shapes, with and without rotation, is
very similar. However, significant differences occur during the drafting and
tumbling phases. In particular, free-to-rotate spheres present longer drafting
phases and separate quickly after the collision. Spheroids remain close to each
other for longer times after the collision, and free-to-rotate ones experience
two or more collision events. Therefore, we have observed a shape-induced
increase in the interaction which might explain the increased tendency to
cluster of the many-particle cases.

pre-train a VOS model on sparsely annotated videos in a semi-supervised manner,

We here report 3D radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations following the
evolution of rapidly accreting protostars resolving the stellar interior. We
use an adaptive mesh refinement code with our newly developed RHD solver
employing an explicit M1 closure method. We follow the early evolution until
the stellar mass reaches $\sim 10~M_\odot$ from two different initial
configurations of spherical and turbulent clouds. We demonstrate that, in both
the cases, a swollen protostar whose radius is $100\mathrm{-}1000~R_\odot$
appears, as predicted by the stellar evolution calculations. Its effective
temperature remains a few thousand Kelvin, and the radiative feedback by
ionizing photons is too weak to disturb the accretion flow up to the epoch
examined in this work. In the turbulent case, the protostar rotates rapidly at
more than 0.4 times the Keplerian velocity owing to the angular momentum
provided by the initial turbulence. The protostar approximates an oblate
spheroid, and its equatorial radius is more than twice the polar radius. Our
results suggest that we need to consider the rapid stellar rotation to
elucidate the realistic 3D protostellar evolution in the supermassive star
formation.

properties of the ionized gas (e.g. metallicity, ionization parameter,
density). We use catalogues of multi-scale stellar associations from
PHANGS$\unicode{x2013}$HST to obtain constraints on the age of the ionizing
sources. We construct a matched catalogue of 4,177 HII regions that are clearly
linked to a single ionizing association. A weak anti-correlation is observed
between the association ages and the H$\alpha$ equivalent width EW(H$\alpha$),
the H$\alpha$/FUV flux ratio and the ionization parameter, log q. As all three
are expected to decrease as the stellar population ages, this could indicate
that we observe an evolutionary sequence. This interpretation is further
supported by correlations between all three properties. Interpreting these as
evolutionary tracers, we find younger nebulae to be more attenuated by dust and
closer to giant molecular clouds, in line with recent models of
feedback-regulated star formation. We also observe strong correlations with the
local metallicity variations and all three proposed age tracers, suggestive of
star formation preferentially occurring in locations of locally enhanced
metallicity. Overall, EW(H$\alpha$) and log q show the most consistent trends
and appear to be most reliable tracers for the age of an HII region.

notion that the large-scale Universe is both statistically homogeneous and
isotropic. But is it invariant also under mirror reflections? To probe this we
require parity-sensitive statistics: for scalar observables, the simplest is
the four-point function. We make the first measurements of the parity-odd CMB
trispectrum, focusing on the large-scale ($2<\ell<510$) temperature
anisotropies measured by Planck. This is facilitated by new maximum-likelihood
estimators for binned correlators, which account for mask convolution and
leakage between even- and odd-parity components, and achieve optimal variances
within $\approx 20\%$. We perform a blind test for parity violation by
comparing a $\chi^2$ statistic from Planck to theoretical expectations, using
two suites of simulations to account for the possible likelihood
non-Gaussianity and residual foregrounds. We find consistency at the $\approx
0.5\sigma$ level, yielding no evidence for parity violation, with roughly
$250\times$ the squared sensitivity of large scale structure measurements
(according to mode-counting arguments), and with the advantage of linear
physics, Gaussian statistics, and accurate mocks. The measured trispectra can
be used to constrain physical models of inflationary parity violation,
including Ghost Inflation, Cosmological Collider scenarios, and Chern-Simons
gauge fields. Considering eight such models, we find no evidence for new
physics, with a maximal detection significance of $2.0\sigma$. These results
suggest that the recent parity excesses seen in the BOSS galaxy survey are not
primordial in origin. Tighter constraints can be wrought by including smaller
scales (though rotational invariance washes out the flat-sky limit) and adding
polarization data.

The full disk coverage shows that the characteristics of molecular gas change
radially from the center to outer disk. The molecular gas distribution shows
coherent large-scale structures in the inner part, including the central
concentration, bar offset ridges, and prominent molecular spiral arms. In the
outer disk, the spiral arms appear less spatially coherent, and even
flocculent. Massive filamentary gas concentrations are abundant even in the
interarm regions. Building up these structures in the interarm regions would
require a very long time (~>100Myr). Instead, they must have formed within
stellar spiral arms and been released into the interarm regions. For such
structures to survive through the dynamical processes, the lifetimes of these
structures and their constituent molecules and molecular clouds must be long
(~>100Myr). These interarm structures host little or no star formation traced
by Halpha. The new map also shows extended CO emission, which likely represents
an ensemble of unresolved molecular clouds.

turn-taking signals from the participants and expresses them on their behalf.
It hides the identity of individuals, making it easier for everyone to take

which equalizes the differences in social signalling skills, and makes it
easier for the speaker to interpret the signals. It continuously gathers

implemented moderation policies, ranging from posting warning labels up to
deplatforming, i.e., permanently banning users. Assessing the effectiveness of
content moderation is crucial for balancing societal safety while preserving
the right to free speech. In this paper, we compare the shift in behavior of
users affected by the ban of two large communities on Reddit, GreatAwakening

body-shaming individuals, respectively. Following the ban, both communities
partially migrated to Voat, an unmoderated Reddit clone. We estimate how many
users migrate, finding that users in the conspiracy community are much more
likely to leave Reddit altogether and join Voat. Then, we quantify the
behavioral shift within Reddit and across Reddit and Voat by matching common
users. Few migrating zealots drive the growth of the new GreatAwakening
community on Voat, while this effect is absent for FatPeopleHate. Finally,
conspiracy users migrating from Reddit tend to recreate their previous social
network on Voat. Our findings suggest that banning conspiracy communities
hosting violent content should be carefully designed, as these communities may
be more resilient to deplatforming.

conducted an online experiment with 595 participants from the US and UK to

tested conditions where the provenance information itself was shown to be

These processes are usually calculated theoretically by invoking the

parton splitting in a thermal medium at finite numbers of colors $N_c$, for
arbitrary momentum-sharing fraction $z$ and with full transverse dynamics. We
show how the problem can be transformed into a system of coupled Schr\""odinger
equations, that we solve numerically. The novel numerical results are used to
estimate the accuracy of several widely used approximations. We check the error
introduced while going from finite $N_c$ (i.e. $N_c =3$) to the large-$N_c$
limit, which we find to be small. For unbalanced splittings, e.g. when $z\to
0$, only one of the partons is affected by transverse momentum exchanges with
the medium. The emission process then separates into a term responsible for the
$1 \to 2$ splitting and the subsequent independent broadening of the daughter
partons. This is also referred to as the factorizable term. For finite $z$,
further contributions arise that are responsible for the coherent color
dynamics of the two-parton system, and these are referred to as
non-factorizable terms. These were argued to be small for soft (unbalanced)
splittings and for large media. In this work we therefore determine the
accuracy of keeping only the factorizable term of the large-$N_c$ solution. We
find that the error is insignificant at a small splitting fraction $z \sim 0$,
but can be sizable in a more balanced splitting with $z\sim 0.5$. Finally, we
also examine the eikonal approximation, which amounts to approximating the
partons' paths through the medium as straight lines. We find that it is
associated with a substantial error for the parameter values we explored in
this work.

difference flat, i.e., the state and input can be reconstructed using flat
output sequences. For the considered class of systems, we synthesize Robust MPC
policies and show how to use historical trajectory data collected during
iterative tasks to 1) obtain bounds on the unmodelled dynamics and 2) construct
a convex value function approximation along with a convex safe set in the space
of output sequences for designing terminal components in the Robust MPC design.
We show that the proposed strategy guarantees robust constraint satisfaction,
asymptotic convergence to a desired subset of the state space, and
non-decreasing closed-loop performance at each policy update. Finally,
simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy on a
minimum time control problem using a constrained nonlinear and uncertain
vehicle model.

optimization is heavily constrained, the generated small features are not
reliably fabricated, leading to optical performance degradation. Even for
simpler, conventional designs, fabrication-induced performance degradation
still occurs. The degree of deviation from the original design not only depends
on the size and shape of its features, but also on the distribution of features

corrections can only be made after calibrating fabrication runs take place. In
this work, we introduce a general deep machine learning model that
automatically corrects photonic device design layouts prior to first

With correction, the outcome of the fabricated layout is closer to what is

theoretical frameworks, mainly close to half-filling. In this work, we
determine the magnetic phase-diagram for the Rashba-Hubbard model for arbitrary
hole doping using a sine square deformed lattice mean-field model with an
unrestricted ansatz, thus suppressing finite size effects. We find that the
introduction of Rashba spin-orbit coupling significantly alters the ground
state properties of the Hubbard model and we observe an increasing complexity
of the ground state phase composition for increasing spin-orbit strength. We
also introduce a gradual deformed envelope (GDE) technique building on the sine
square methodology to facilitate convergence towards ordered and defect-free
ground state configurations which is a challenge with the unrestricted ansatz
at high interaction strengths. We observe that the use of the GDE technique
significantly lowers the free energy of the obtained configurations. Moreover,
we consider transient dynamics in the Rashba-Hubbard model by quenching the
interaction strength. We find that the quench dynamics within a sine-square
methodology allows for the simulation of quasi-open systems by using the
zero-energy edge states as a particle reservoir. Interaction quenches at
half-filling show a tendency towards quench-induced spatial spin-magnitude
inhomogeneity and a non-equilibrium system magnetization lower than equilibrium
predictions, possibly related to a build-up of non-local correlations on the

with infinite speed is a homogeneous solution and coincides with the usual

sufficient condition without solving the dispersion relation. The solitons are
very fragile: they are as unstable as the homogeneous neutrino gas alone.
Moreover, in the presence of matter, only the solution survives that is

different methods to detect unseen objects. However, most of these works
require additional captions or images for training, which is not feasible in
the context of zero-shot detection. In contrast, the distillation-based method
is an extra-data-free method, but it has its limitations. Specifically,
existing work creates distillation regions that are biased to the base
categories, which limits the distillation of novel category information and
harms the distillation efficiency. Furthermore, directly using the raw feature
from CLIP for distillation neglects the domain gap between the training data of
CLIP and the detection datasets, which makes it difficult to learn the mapping
from the image region to the vision-language feature space - an essential
component for detecting unseen objects. As a result, existing
distillation-based methods require an excessively long training schedule. To
solve these problems, we propose Efficient feature distillation for Zero-Shot
Detection (EZSD). Firstly, EZSD adapts the CLIP's feature space to the target
detection domain by re-normalizing CLIP to bridge the domain gap; Secondly,
EZSD uses CLIP to generate distillation proposals with potential novel
instances, to avoid the distillation being overly biased to the base
categories. Finally, EZSD takes advantage of semantic meaning for regression to
further improve the model performance. As a result, EZSD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the COCO zero-shot benchmark with a much
shorter training schedule and outperforms previous work by 4% in LVIS overall

under-constrained, we explicitly disentangle geometric-preserving intensity
mapping (skull-stripping and intensity normalization) and spatial
transformation (spatial normalization). Quantitative results show that our

Circular Rydberg atoms open the way to simulations over very long time scales,
using a combination of laser trapping of the atoms and spontaneous-emission
inhibition, as shown in the proposal of a XXZ spin-array simulator based on
chains of trapped circular atoms [T.L. Nguyen $\textit{et al.}$, Phys. Rev. X
8, 011032 (2018)]. Such simulators could reach regimes (thermalization, glassy
dynamics) that are out of the reach of those based on ordinary,
low-angular-momentum short-lived Rydberg atoms. Over the promised long time
scales, the unavoidable coupling of the spin dynamics with the atomic motion in
the traps may play an important role. We study here the interplay between the
spin exchange and motional dynamics in the simple case of two interacting
circular Rydberg atoms confined in harmonic traps. The time evolution is solved
exactly when the position dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction terms can
be linearized over the extension of the atomic motion. We present numerical
simulations in more complex cases, using the realistic parameters of the
simulator proposal. We discuss three applications. First, we show that
realistic experimental parameters lead to a regime in which atomic and spin
dynamics become fully entangled, generating interesting non-classical motional
states. We also show that, in other parameter regions, the spin dynamics
notably depends on the initial temperature of the atoms in the trap, providing
a sensitive motional thermometry method. Last, and most importantly, we discuss
the range of parameters in which the motion has negligible influence over the
spin dynamics.

basis, a particular basis that is uniquely constructed using the Hamiltonian of
a given physical system. Viewing each basis vector as one site, this basis
naturally constitutes a one-dimensional chain, so that the state evolution can
be mapped to a particle propagating on the chain, and its position is the
Krylov state complexity. Based on this interpretation, we derive an Ehrenfest
theorem for the Krylov complexity, which reveals its close relation to the
spectrum. In particular, we find that the Krylov state complexity is directly
driven by the properly normalized spectral form factor. This allows us to give
an analytical expression for Krylov state complexity in random matrix theory.
We also study the time evolution of the wavefunction in the Krylov basis. This
provides the transition probability associated to the evolution of the initial
state to the basis vector at a given site. For chaotic systems, including
random matrix theories and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, we numerically observe
a universal rise-slope-ramp-plateau behavior of the transition probability,
with a long linear ramp. For the Gaussian unitary ensemble, we analytically
explain this universal behavior for the sites located on the first half of the
chain. The long linear ramp in the transition probability at each site leads to
a peak in the Krylov complexity at late times. For non-chaotic systems, the
transition probability shows a different behavior without the linear ramp. Our
results clarify which features of the wave function time evolution in Krylov
space characterize chaos.

(dSph) galaxies are excellent places to search for annihilation signals because
they are rich in DM and background emission is low. If magnetic fields in dSph
galaxies exist, the particles produced in DM annihilation emit synchrotron
radiation. We used the non-detection of 150 MHz radio continuum emission from
dSph galaxies with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) to derive constraints on the
annihilation cross section of WIMPs in electron-positron pairs. Our main
underlying assumption is that the transport of the cosmic rays can be described
by the diffusion approximation, which necessitates the existence of magnetic
fields. We used observations of six dSph galaxies in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky
Survey (LoTSS). The data were reimaged and radial profiles were generated. We
also used stacking to increase the sensitivity. In order to derive upper limits
on the WIMP cross section, we injected fake Gaussian sources into the data,
which were then detected with 2$\sigma$ significance in the radial profile.
These sources represent the lowest emission we would have been able to detect.
We present limits from the observations of individual galaxies as well as from
stacking. We explored the uncertainty due to the choice of diffusion and
magnetic field parameters by constructing three different model scenarios:
optimistic (OPT), intermediate (INT), and pessimistic (PES). Assuming
monochromatic annihilation into electron-positron pairs, the limits from the
INT scenario exclude thermal WIMPs below 20 GeV, and the limits from the OPT
scenario even exclude thermal WIMPs below 70 GeV. The INT limits can compete
with limits set by Fermi-LAT using $\gamma$-ray observations of multiple dwarf
galaxies, and they are especially strong for low WIMP masses.

determining several properties of finite nuclei to the neutron stars with mass
$\sim$ 1.4 $M_\odot$. The values of neutron skin thickness, isovector giant
dipole resonances energies and various nuclear reaction cross-sections in
asymmetric nuclei have been utilized to determine the slope of symmetry energy
($L_0$) at the saturation density. Recent PREX-II and CREX measurements of
neutron skin thickness in $^{208}$Pb and $^{48}$Ca nuclei yield very different
values of $L_0$ which overlap marginally within 90$\%$ confidence interval.
  Purpose: Our objective is to demonstrate the role of symmetry energy on the
sub-barrier fusion cross-section and the astrophysical $S$-factor for
asymmetric nuclei.
  Method: The nucleus nucleus potentials are generated using the double folding
model (DFM) for three different nucleon-nucleon interactions. These DFM
potentials are used for the calculation of the sub-barrier fusion cross-section
and the astrophysical $S$-factor. The nucleon densities required for DFM
potentials are generated from different families of non-relativistic and
relativistic mean-field models which correspond to a wide range of neutron skin
thickness or $L_0$.
  Results: We have calculated the sub-barrier fusion cross-section for several
asymmetric nuclei involving O, Ca, Ni, and Sn isotopes. The results are
presented for the barrier parameters, cross-section, and astrophysical
$S$-factor for $^{54}$Ca+$^{54}$Ca and $^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn as a function of
neutron skin thickness.
  Conclusions: The cross-section for the neutron-rich nuclei show a strong
dependence on the behavior of symmetry energy or the neutron skin thickness.
The increase in skin thickness lowers the height of the barrier as well as its
width which enhances the values of the $S$-factor by more than an order of
magnitude.

Therefore, the focus of this investigation is to compare the key factors

Reporting System (FARS) for two types of rear-end crashes from 2017 to 2019,
including passenger cars as rear-end and rear-ended vehicles. Significant
injury severity difference between front- and rear-car occupant groups is found

heterogeneity in means (CRPLHM) and the random parameter logit model with
heterogeneity in means (RPLHM), respectively. From the modeling, the
significant factors are occupant positions, driver age, overturn, vehicle type,
etc. For instance, the driving and front-right positions significantly increase
the probability of severe injury when struck by another vehicle. Large
truck-strike-car tends to cause severe outcomes compared to car-strike-large
truck. This study provides an insightful knowledge of mechanism of occupant
injury severity in rear-end crashes, and propose some effective countermeasures
to mitigate the crash severity, such as implementing stricter seat belt laws,
improving the coverage of the streetlights, strengthening car driver's
emergency response ability.

surrounding medium. The maximum speed reached by these outflows, the terminal
wind speed, is a global wind parameter and an essential input for models of
stellar atmospheres and feedback. With the arrival of the ULLYSES programme, a
legacy UV spectroscopic survey with HST, we have the opportunity to quantify
the wind speeds of massive stars at sub-solar metallicity (in the Large and
Small Magellanic Clouds, 0.5Z and 0.2Z) at an unprecedented scale. We
empirically quantify the wind speeds of a large sample of OB stars, including
supergiants, giants, and dwarfs at sub-solar metallicity. Using these
measurements, we investigate trends of terminal wind speed with a number of
fundamental stellar parameters, namely effective temperature, metallicity, and
surface escape velocity. We empirically determined the terminal wind speed for
a sample of 149 OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds either by directly measuring
the maximum velocity shift of the absorption component of the Civ 1548-1550
line profile, or by fitting synthetic spectra produced using the Sobolev with
exact integration method. Stellar parameters were either collected from the
literature, obtained using spectral-type calibrations, or predicted from
evolutionary models. We find strong trends of terminal wind speed with
effective temperature and surface escape speed when the wind is strong enough
to cause a saturated P Cygni profile in Civ 1548-1550. We find evidence for a
metallicity dependence on the terminal wind speed proportional to Z^0.22+-0.03
when we compared our results to previous Galactic studies. Our results suggest
that effective temperature rather than surface escape speed should be used as a
straightforward empirical prediction of terminal wind speed and that the
observed metallicity dependence is steeper than suggested by earlier works.

against such attacks is challenging, especially in real-world black-box

a novel backdoor defense framework that can effectively defend against various
attacks through zero-shot image purification (ZIP). Our proposed framework can
be applied to black-box models without requiring any internal information about
the poisoned model or any prior knowledge of the clean/poisoned samples. Our
defense framework involves a two-step process. First, we apply a linear
transformation on the poisoned image to destroy the trigger pattern. Then, we
use a pre-trained diffusion model to recover the missing semantic information
removed by the transformation. In particular, we design a new reverse process
using the transformed image to guide the generation of high-fidelity purified
images, which can be applied in zero-shot settings. We evaluate our ZIP
backdoor defense framework on multiple datasets with different kinds of
attacks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our ZIP framework
compared to state-of-the-art backdoor defense baselines. We believe that our
results will provide valuable insights for future defense methods for black-box

converted to a scalar value (the score) through some mapping (the score

key contribution is that the correctness of this controller only relies on the

values at all states. The monotonicity conditions may be checked online by
moving the WMR, without state estimation, or offline using a generative model

algorithms since they are applicable to a wide variety of fields. However, the
underlying optimization processes within these algorithms usually deal with
local minima and barren plateau problems, preventing them from scaling
efficiently. Our goal in this paper is to study alternative optimization
methods that avoid or reduce the effect of these problems. To this end, we
propose to apply the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm to VQAs. Our
hypothesis is that DE is resilient to vanishing gradients and local minima for
two main reasons: (i) it does not depend on gradients, and (ii) its mutation
and recombination schemes allow DE to continue evolving even in these cases. To
demonstrate the performance of our approach, we use a robust local minima
problem to compare state-of-the-art local optimizers (SLSQP, COBYLA, L-BFGS-B
and SPSA) against DE using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. Our
results show that DE always outperforms local optimizers. In particular, in our
experiments with 14 qubits, DE achieves the ground state with 100\% success
rate, while local optimizers only achieve around 40\%. We also show that DE can
be combined with local optimizers to avoid all local minima as well as to
provide a high convergence to the global minimum.

bio-inspiration. Bone, nacre, and other such stiff structural biological
materials (SSBMs) are composites that contain mineral and organic materials
interlaid together in layers. In nacre, this lamellar architecture is known to
contribute to its fracture toughness, and has been investigated with the goal
of discovering new engineering material design principles that can aid the
development of synthetic composites that are both strong and tough. The
skeletal anchor fibers (spicules) of $\textit{Euplectella aspergillum}$
($\textit{Ea.}$) also display a lamellar architecture; however, it was recently
shown using fracture mechanics experiments and computations that the lamellar
structure in them does not significantly contribute to their fracture
toughness. An alternate hypothesis$-$load carrying capacity (LCC)
hypothesis$-$regarding the lamellar architecture's functional significance in
$\textit{Ea.}$ spicules is that it enhances the spicule's strength, rather than
its toughness. From the ecology perspective the LCC hypothesis is certainly
plausible, since a higher strength would allow the spicules to more firmly
anchor $\textit{Ea.}$ to the sea floor, which would be beneficial to it since
it is a filter feeding animal. In this paper we present support for the LCC
hypothesis from the solid and structural mechanics perspective, which, compared
to the support from ecology, is far harder to identify but equally, if not
more, compelling and valid. We found that when the spicule functions in a
knotted configuration a reduced bending stiffness benefits its load carrying
capacity, and that for a wide class of materials that are consistent with the
spicules' axial symmetry, sectioning a cylindrical tube into an assembly of
co-axial tubes can reduce the tube's bending stiffness.

near the 'cylinder', i.e. Friedrich's representation of spacelike infinity.
This analysis can be considered a toy model for the behaviour of the full
Einstein equations and the resulting logarithmic singularities that appear to
be characteristic for massive spacetimes. The investigation of the Cauchy
problem for the conformally invariant wave equation (Frauendiener and Hennig
2018, Class. Quantum Grav. 35, 065015) showed that solutions generically
develop logarithmic singularities at infinitely many expansion orders at the
cylinder, but an arbitrary finite number of these singularities can be removed
by appropriately restricting the initial data prescribed at $t=0$. From a
physical point of view, any data at $t=0$ are determined from the earlier
history of the system and hence not exactly 'free data'. Therefore, it is
appropriate to ask what happens if we 'go further back in time' and prescribe
initial data as early as possible, namely at a portion of past null infinity,
and on a second past null hypersurface to complete the initial value problem.
Will regular data at past null infinity automatically lead to a regular
evolution up to future null infinity? Or does past regularity restrict the
solutions too much, and regularity at both null infinities is mutually
exclusive? Or do we still have suitable degrees of freedom for the data that
can be chosen to influence regularity of the solutions to any desired degree?
In order to answer these questions, we study the corresponding characteristic
initial value problem. In particular, we investigate in detail the appearance
of singularities at expansion orders $n=0,\dots,4$ for angular modes
$\ell=0,\dots,4$.

source singer to the voice of a target singer. Recently, methods that leverage
self-supervised audio representations such as HuBERT and Wav2Vec 2.0 have
helped further the state-of-the-art. Though these methods produce more natural
and melodic singing outputs, they often rely on confusion and disentanglement
losses to render the self-supervised representations speaker and
pitch-invariant. In this paper, we circumvent disentanglement training and
propose a new model that leverages ASR fine-tuned self-supervised
representations as inputs to a HiFi-GAN neural vocoder for singing voice
conversion. We experiment with different f0 encoding schemes and show that an
f0 harmonic generation module that uses a parallel bank of transposed
convolutions (PBTC) alongside ASR fine-tuned Wav2Vec 2.0 features results in
the best singing voice conversion quality. Additionally, the model is capable
of making a spoken voice sing. We also show that a simple f0 shifting scheme
during inference helps retain singer identity and bolsters the performance of
our singing voice conversion model. Our results are backed up by extensive MOS
studies that compare different ablations and baselines.

Unfortunately, limited research has explored the use of automated AFB video
analysis for efficient lesion detection. We propose a robust automatic AFB

frames in a video. In addition, for the informative frames, we determine the
frames containing potential lesions and delineate candidate lesion regions. Our
approach draws upon a combination of computer-based image analysis, machine

more tractable. Tests with patient AFB video indicate that $\ge$97\% of frames

Herein, we bridge this gap and present a comprehensive semianalytical design
method for dual-polarized MGs with a separable response for TE and TM waves.
First, by relating a printed circuit board (PCB) compatible array of dog-bone
elements with the canonical dipole line analytical model, we establish a
meta-atom for TM-polarized MGs, featuring negligible interaction with TE waves.
Subsequently, we integrate the proposed configuration with a systematic
synthesis scheme to implement a TM beam splitter MG, harnessing the equivalent
dipole line model to resolve analytically the optimal meta-atom coordinates and
dog-bone polarizability, without resorting to full-wave optimization. Finally,
we show that a dual-polarized MG beam splitter can be conveniently synthesized
correspondingly, combining the TM-polarized structure as is with previously

integration of sparse, semianlaytically synthesized, efficient MGs in practical

various origins. On average, about 10% of the hits of an event are noises.
Still, the noise level differs event by event, and some of the events might
even get more noise hits than signal hits, making the analysis less efficient.
The standard algorithms of the offline software system of BESIII reconstruct
signal tracks using the polluted data. This reduces the reconstruction
efficiency of high noise tracks. In this article, we test the idea of using
supervised deep learning techniques to remove this noise beforehand. We

help understand the metallicity, extinction and result in better age
determinations than isochrone-fitting alone. We combine a multitude of recent
observations from Gaia, high-resolution spectroscopy, and extinction maps to
analyse the cluster and then search for and detect variability in the member
stars using TESS FFI data. To interpret all of these data, we used stellar
structure, evolution and oscillation codes. We performed an isochrone fitting
to the cluster using publically-available isochrones, which provides a cluster
age of between 0.6 to 1.1 Ga. Then using TESS Full-frame images, we analysed
the time dimension of the members of this cluster. We created optimised pixel
light curves using the ${\tt tessipack}$ package which allows us to consider
possible contamination by nearby stars. Using these light curves, we identified
many interesting levels of variability of stars in this cluster, including
binaries and oscillating stars. For the asteroseismic analysis, we selected a
few uncontaminated A--F type oscillating stars and used the MESA and GYRE codes
to interpret the frequency signals. By comparing the theoretical and the
observed spectra, we identified frequency separations, $\Delta\nu$, for four
stars. Then using the identified $\Delta\nu$ and imposing that the best matched
theoretical models have the same age, metallicity and background extinction, we
constrained the cluster's age to 1.0 $\pm$ 0.1 Ga. We conclude that using the

digital platforms, have the potential to significantly improve health outcomes,
through education, motivation, reminders, and outreach. We study the problem of
optimizing personalized interventions for patients to maximize some long-term
outcome, in a setting where interventions are costly and capacity-constrained.
  Methodology/results: This paper provides a model-free approach to solving
this problem. We find that generic model-free approaches from the reinforcement
learning literature are too data intensive for healthcare applications, while
simpler bandit approaches make progress at the expense of ignoring long-term
patient dynamics. We present a new algorithm we dub DecompPI that approximates
one step of policy iteration. Implementing DecompPI simply consists of a
prediction task from offline data, alleviating the need for online
experimentation. Theoretically, we show that under a natural set of structural
assumptions on patient dynamics, DecompPI surprisingly recovers at least 1/2 of
the improvement possible between a naive baseline policy and the optimal
policy. At the same time, DecompPI is both robust to estimation errors and
interpretable. Through an empirical case study on a mobile health platform for
improving treatment adherence for tuberculosis, we find that DecompPI can
provide the same efficacy as the status quo with approximately half the
capacity of interventions.
  Managerial implications: DecompPI is general and is easily implementable for
organizations aiming to improve long-term behavior through targeted
interventions. Our case study suggests that the platform's costs of deploying
interventions can potentially be cut by 50%, which facilitates the ability to
scale up the system in a cost-efficient fashion.

evolution through interactions with the disc gas, we perform a suite of 2D
high-resolution, local shearing box, viscous hydrodynamical simulations of
equal-mass binaries. We find that viscosity not only smooths the flow structure
around prograde circular binaries, but also greatly raises their accretion
rates. The overwhelming positive torque associated with the accretion dominates
over the gravitational torque, and drives binary orbital expansion. However,
retrograde binaries still experience rapid orbital decay, and prograde
eccentric binaries still experience eccentricity damping, despite undergoing
outspiral. Our numerical experiments further show that prograde binaries may
experience inspiral if the physical sizes of the accretors are sufficiently
small, such that the net binary accretion is reduced. Such a dependence of the
binary accretion rate on the accretor size can be weaken through boosted
accretion either due to a high viscosity or a more isothermal-like equation of
state (EOS). Our results widen the explored parameter space for the
hydrodynamics of embedded BBHs and demonstrate that their orbital evolution in
AGN discs is a complex, multifaceted problem.

are based on multi-instance learning schemes (MIL), which usually rely on
pretrained features to represent the instances. Due to the lack of
task-specific annotated data, these features are either obtained from
well-established backbones on natural images, or, more recently from
self-supervised models pretrained on histopathology. However, both approaches
yield task-agnostic features, resulting in performance loss compared to the
appropriate task-related supervision, if available. In this paper, we show that
when task-specific annotations are limited, we can inject such supervision into
downstream task training, to reduce the gap between fully task-tuned and task

prompts into WSI classification. Prompt-MIL adopts a prompt tuning mechanism,
where only a small fraction of parameters calibrates the pretrained features to
encode task-specific information, rather than the conventional full fine-tuning
approaches. Extensive experiments on three WSI datasets, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-CRC,

explicit image prior or ground-truth examples. An overarching challenge in
inverse problems is that there are many undesired images that fit to the
observed measurements, thus requiring image priors to constrain the space of
possible solutions to more plausible reconstructions. However, in many
applications it is difficult or potentially impossible to obtain ground-truth
images to learn an image prior. Thus, inaccurate priors are often used, which
inevitably result in biased solutions. Rather than solving an inverse problem
using priors that encode the explicit structure of any one image, we propose to
solve a set of inverse problems jointly by incorporating prior constraints on
the collective structure of the underlying images.The key assumption of our
work is that the ground-truth images we aim to reconstruct share common,
low-dimensional structure. We show that such a set of inverse problems can be
solved simultaneously by learning a shared image generator with a
low-dimensional latent space. The parameters of the generator and latent
embedding are learned by maximizing a proxy for the Evidence Lower Bound
(ELBO). Once learned, the generator and latent embeddings can be combined to
provide reconstructions for each inverse problem. The framework we propose can
handle general forward model corruptions, and we show that measurements derived
from only a few ground-truth images (O(10)) are sufficient for image
reconstruction without explicit priors.

spatial scales constitute a fundamental topic in neuroscience and
neuro-inspired engineering. Much attention has been paid to large networks and
long-term memory, for example in models of associative memory. Smaller circuit
motifs may play an important complementary role on shorter time scales, where
broader network effects may be of less relevance. Yet, compact computational
models of spiking neural networks that exhibit short-term volatile memory and
actively hold information until their energy source is switched off, seem not
fully understood. Here we propose that small spiking neural circuit motifs may
act as volatile memory components. A minimal motif consists of only two
interconnected neurons -- one self-connected excitatory neuron and one
inhibitory neuron -- and realizes a single-bit volatile memory. An excitatory,
delayed self-connection promotes a bistable circuit in which a self-sustained
periodic orbit generating spike trains co-exists with the quiescent state of no
neuron spiking. Transient external inputs may straightforwardly induce
switching between those states. Moreover, the inhibitory neuron may act as an
autonomous turn-off switch. It integrates incoming excitatory pulses until a
threshold is reached after which the inhibitory neuron emits a spike that then
inhibits further spikes in the excitatory neuron, terminating the memory. Our
results show how external bits of information (excitatory signal), can be
actively held in memory for a pre-defined amount of time. We show that such
memory operations are robust against parameter variations and exemplify how
sequences of multidimensional input signals may control the dynamics of a
many-bits memory circuit in a desired way.

devices often contain a wealth of data and this information is sensitive and
should not be shared with servers or enterprises. As a result, federated
learning was introduced to enable machine learning over large decentralized
datasets while promising privacy by eliminating the need for data sharing.
However, prior work has shown that shared gradients often contain private
information and attackers can gain knowledge either through malicious
modification of the architecture and parameters or by using optimization to
approximate user data from the shared gradients. Despite this, most attacks
have so far been limited in scale of number of clients, especially failing when
client gradients are aggregated together using secure model aggregation. The
attacks that still function are strongly limited in the number of clients
attacked, amount of training samples they leak, or number of iterations they
take to be trained. In this work, we introduce MANDRAKE, an attack that
overcomes previous limitations to directly leak large amounts of client data
even under secure aggregation across large numbers of clients. Furthermore, we
break the anonymity of aggregation as the leaked data is identifiable and
directly tied back to the clients they come from. We show that by sending
clients customized convolutional parameters, the weight gradients of data
points between clients will remain separate through aggregation. With an
aggregation across many clients, prior work could only leak less than 1% of
images. With the same number of non-zero parameters, and using only a single

representation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art generation quality and also
enables part-level shape editing and manipulation without any additional
training in conditional setup. Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in data generation as well as zero-shot completion and editing via
a guided reverse process. Recent research on 3D diffusion models has focused on
improving their generation capabilities with various data representations,
while the absence of structural information has limited their capability in
completion and editing tasks. We thus propose our novel diffusion model using a
part-level implicit representation. To effectively learn diffusion with
high-dimensional embedding vectors of parts, we propose a cascaded framework,
learning diffusion first on a low-dimensional subspace encoding extrinsic
parameters of parts and then on the other high-dimensional subspace encoding
intrinsic attributes. In the experiments, we demonstrate the outperformance of
our method compared with the previous ones both in generation and part-level
completion and manipulation tasks.

visualizing and characterizing detailed neuroanatomy, and helps to link
microscale histology studies with morphometric measurements. However, automated
segmentation methods for brain mapping in ex vivo MRI are not well developed,
primarily due to limited availability of labeled datasets, and heterogeneity in
scanner hardware and acquisition protocols. In this work, we present a high
resolution dataset of 37 ex vivo post-mortem human brain tissue specimens
scanned on a 7T whole-body MRI scanner. We developed a deep learning pipeline
to segment the cortical mantle by benchmarking the performance of nine deep
neural architectures. We then segment the four subcortical structures: caudate,
putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus; white matter hyperintensities, and the
normal appearing white matter. We show excellent generalizing capabilities
across whole brain hemispheres in different specimens, and also on unseen
images acquired at different magnetic field strengths and different imaging

measurements across key regions, and link them with semi-quantitative
neuropathological ratings. Our code, containerized executables, and the

  Impact Prediction on Traffic Networks",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The prompt estimation of traffic incident impacts can guide commuters in
their trip planning and improve the resilience of transportation agencies'
decision-making on resilience. However, it is more challenging than node-level
and graph-level forecasting tasks, as it requires extracting the anomaly
subgraph or sub-time-series from dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose
DG-Trans, a novel traffic incident impact prediction framework, to foresee the
impact of traffic incidents through dynamic graph learning. The proposed
framework contains a dual-level spatial transformer and an
importance-score-based temporal transformer, and the performance of this
framework is justified by two newly constructed benchmark datasets. The
dual-level spatial transformer removes unnecessary edges between nodes to
isolate the affected subgraph from the other nodes. Meanwhile, the
importance-score-based temporal transformer identifies abnormal changes in node
features, causing the predictions to rely more on measurement changes after the
incident occurs. Therefore, DG-Trans is equipped with dual abilities that
extract spatiotemporal dependency and identify anomaly nodes affected by
incidents while removing noise introduced by benign nodes. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets verify that DG-Trans outperforms the
existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in extracting spatiotemporal
dependency patterns and predicting traffic accident impacts. It offers
promising potential for traffic incident management systems.

which IMVC via contrastive learning has received attention due to its excellent
performance. The previous methods have the following problems: 1) Over-reliance
on additional projection heads when solving the dimensional collapse problem in
which latent features are only valid in lower-dimensional subspaces during
clustering. However, many parameters in the projection heads are unnecessary.
2) The recovered view contain inconsistent private information and useless
private information will mislead the learning of common semantics due to
consistent learning and reconstruction learning on the same feature. To address
the above issues, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view contrastive
clustering framework. This framework directly optimizes the latent feature
subspace, utilizes the learned feature vectors and their sub-vectors for
reconstruction learning and consistency learning, thereby effectively avoiding
dimensional collapse without relying on projection heads. Since reconstruction
loss and contrastive loss are performed on different features, the adverse
effect of useless private information is reduced. For the incomplete data, the
missing information is recovered by the cross-view prediction mechanism and the
inconsistent information from different views is discarded by the minimum
conditional entropy to further avoid the influence of private information.
Extensive experimental results of the method on 5 public datasets show that the
method achieves state-of-the-art clustering results.

coordinator strategies and translate them back to feedback strategies that the
original agents can deploy. We prove that the strategies are $\epsilon$-optimal

utilized by the opponent team. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality
diminishes when the size of both teams approaches infinity.

  Detection and Geometric Uncertainty Propagation","Accepted at CVPR 2023 as a highlight paper",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The two-stage object pose estimation paradigm first detects semantic
keypoints on the image and then estimates the 6D pose by minimizing
reprojection errors. Despite performing well on standard benchmarks, existing
techniques offer no provable guarantees on the quality and uncertainty of the
estimation. In this paper, we inject two fundamental changes, namely conformal
keypoint detection and geometric uncertainty propagation, into the two-stage
paradigm and propose the first pose estimator that endows an estimation with
provable and computable worst-case error bounds. On one hand, conformal
keypoint detection applies the statistical machinery of inductive conformal
prediction to convert heuristic keypoint detections into circular or elliptical
prediction sets that cover the groundtruth keypoints with a user-specified
marginal probability (e.g., 90%). Geometric uncertainty propagation, on the
other, propagates the geometric constraints on the keypoints to the 6D object
pose, leading to a Pose UnceRtainty SEt (PURSE) that guarantees coverage of the
groundtruth pose with the same probability. The PURSE, however, is a nonconvex
set that does not directly lead to estimated poses and uncertainties.
Therefore, we develop RANdom SAmple averaGing (RANSAG) to compute an average
pose and apply semidefinite relaxation to upper bound the worst-case errors
between the average pose and the groundtruth. On the LineMOD Occlusion dataset
we demonstrate: (i) the PURSE covers the groundtruth with valid probabilities;
(ii) the worst-case error bounds provide correct uncertainty quantification;

sub-optimal applications in reality. To address this issue, in this paper we
conduct extensive empirical studies for a comprehensive understanding of the
SSD cluster in diverse settings. To this end, we configure a real SSD cluster
and gather the generated trace data based on some often-used benchmarks, then
adopt analytical methods to analyse the performance of the SSD cluster with
different configurations. In particular, regression models are built to provide
better performance predictability under broader configurations, and the
correlations between influential factors and performance metrics with respect
to different numbers of nodes are investigated, which reveal the high
scalability of the SSD cluster. Additionally, the cluster's network bandwidth
is inspected to explain the performance bottleneck. Finally, the knowledge
gained is summarised to benefit the SSD cluster deployment in practice.

of one's body. Recent efforts to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms
behind the brain's encoding of the self-body have led to various attempts to
develop a unified theoretical framework to explain related behavioral and
neurophysiological phenomena. A central question to be explained is how body
illusions such as the rubber hand illusion actually occur. Despite the
conceptual descriptions of the mechanisms of bodily self-consciousness and the
possible relevant brain areas, the existing theoretical models still lack an
explanation of the computational mechanisms by which the brain encodes the
perception of one's body and how our subjectively perceived body illusions can
be generated by neural networks. Here we integrate the biological findings of
bodily self-consciousness to propose a Brain-inspired bodily self-perception
model, by which perceptions of bodily self can be autonomously constructed
without any supervision signals. We successfully validated our computational
model with six rubber hand illusion experiments and a disability experiment on
platforms including a iCub humanoid robot and simulated environments. The
experimental results show that our model can not only well replicate the
behavioral and neural data of monkeys in biological experiments, but also
reasonably explain the causes and results of the rubber hand illusion from the
neuronal level due to advantages in biological interpretability, thus
contributing to the revealing of the computational and neural mechanisms
underlying the occurrence of the rubber hand illusion.

final transverse momentum distribution of regenerated charmonium depends on the
degree of charm quark kinetic thermalization. When the charm momentum
distribution becomes harder, more charm quarks are distributed in the middle
and high $p_T$, where the production of regenerated charmonium also becomes
larger. With non-thermal momentum distribution of charm quarks in their
coalescence process, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}(p_T)$ of
charmonium enhances at middle $p_T$. Besides, the elliptic flow $v_2(p_T)$ of
charmonium also enhances at middle $p_T$ as more regenerated charmonium are
distributed in this $p_T$ region. The theoretical calculations with non-thermal
charm distribution explain well the $p_T$ dependence of charmonium $R_{AA}$ and

robotic control. As an example, we are studying the installation of a cranial
window in a mouse. This operation requires the removal of the skull, which is
approximately 300 um thick, to cut it into a circular shape 8 mm in diameter,
but the shape of the mouse skull varies depending on the strain of mouse, sex
and week of age. The thickness of the skull is not uniform, with some areas
being thin and others thicker. It is also difficult to ensure that the skulls
of the mice are kept in the same position for each operation. It is not
realistically possible to measure all these features and pre-program a robotic
trajectory for individual mice. The paper therefore proposes an autonomous
robotic drilling method. The proposed method consists of drilling trajectory
planning and image-based task completion level recognition. The trajectory
planning adjusts the z-position of the drill according to the task completion
level at each discrete point, and forms the 3D drilling path via constrained
cubic spline interpolation while avoiding overshoot. The task completion level
recognition uses a DSSD-inspired deep learning model to estimate the task
completion level of each discrete point. Since an egg has similar
characteristics to a mouse skull in terms of shape, thickness and mechanical
properties, removing the egg shell without damaging the membrane underneath was
chosen as the simulation task. The proposed method was evaluated using a 6-DOF
robotic arm holding a drill and achieved a success rate of 80% out of 20

outlier optimization (AUTO), which consists of an in-out-aware filter, an ID

pseudo-ID and pseudo-OOD samples from test data, utilizing them to optimize

recent years are deep learning-based due to their strength in encoding complex

rely heavily on past observations and cannot effectively capture the transient

hierarchical hybrid framework of deep learning (DL) and reinforcement learning
(RL) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, to cope with the challenge of
predicting motions shaped by multi-scale interactions. In the DL stage, the
traffic scene is divided into multiple intermediate-scale heterogenous graphs
based on which Transformer-style GNNs are adopted to encode heterogenous
interactions at intermediate and global levels. In the RL stage, we divide the
traffic scene into local sub-scenes utilizing the key future points predicted
in the DL stage. To emulate the motion planning procedure so as to produce
trajectory predictions, a Transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
incorporated with a vehicle kinematics model is devised to plan motions under
the dominant influence of microscopic interactions. A multi-objective reward is
designed to balance between agent-centric accuracy and scene-wise
compatibility. Experimental results show that our proposal matches the
state-of-the-arts on the Argoverse forecasting benchmark. It's also revealed by

polarized dust emission from a MHD model of protostellar formation, using the
POLARIS dust radiative transfer tool, which includes dust alignment with
Radiative Torques Alignment (RATs). We test how the polarized dust emission
from the model core depends on the irradiation conditions in the protostellar
envelope, by varying the radiation due to accretion luminosity propagating from
the central protostellar embryo throughout the envelope. The level of grain
alignment efficiency obtained in the radiative transfer models is then compared
to (sub-) millimeter ALMA dust polarization observations of Class 0 protostars.
Our radiative transfer calculations have a central irradiation that reproduces
the protostellar luminosities typically observed towards low- to
intermediate-mass protostars, as well as super-paramagnetic grains, and grains
>10 micron, which are required to bring the dust grain alignment efficiencies
of the synthetic observations up to observed levels. Our radiative transfer
calculations show that irradiation plays an important role in the mechanisms
that dictate the size range of aligned grains in Class 0 protostars. Regions of
the envelope that are preferentially irradiated harbor strong polarized dust
emission but can be affected by the rotational disruption of dust grains.
Episodes of high luminosity could affect grain alignment and trigger grain
disruption mechanisms. [abridged]

CAN-based in-vehicle networks (IVNs) face security risks owing to the CAN
mechanisms. An adversary can sabotage a vehicle by leveraging the security
risks if they can access the CAN bus. Thus, recent actions and cybersecurity
regulations (e.g., UNR 155) require carmakers to implement intrusion detection
systems (IDSs) in their vehicles. An IDS should detect cyberattacks and provide
a forensic capability to analyze attacks. Although many IDSs have been
proposed, considerations regarding their feasibility and explainability remain
lacking. This study proposes X-CANIDS, which is a novel IDS for CAN-based IVNs.
X-CANIDS dissects the payloads in CAN messages into human-understandable
signals using a CAN database. The signals improve the intrusion detection
performance compared with the use of bit representations of raw payloads. These
signals also enable an understanding of which signal or ECU is under attack.
X-CANIDS can detect zero-day attacks because it does not require any labeled
dataset in the training phase. We confirmed the feasibility of the proposed
method through a benchmark test on an automotive-grade embedded device with a
GPU. The results of this work will be valuable to carmakers and researchers
considering the installation of in-vehicle IDSs for their vehicles.

its ability to reduce the amount of transmitted data without sacrificing task
performance. While existing works have focused on designing advanced semantic
communication architectures and efficient semantic codecs, challenges such as
explainable and efficient semantic representation methods, and knowledge-based
semantic compression algorithms have yet to be explored. These challenges have
hindered the widespread adoption of semantic communication. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication system based on
Semantic Triplets (SCST), in which semantics are represented through
explainable semantic triplets. A novel semantic extraction method is proposed
to convert transmitted text into semantic triplets, where syntactic dependency
analysis is introduced to improve semantic completeness. Furthermore, a
semantic filtering method is designed to compress duplicate and task-irrelevant
semantic triplets, making use of prior knowledge from the knowledge base. The
filtered semantic triplets are then encoded and transmitted wirelessly to
complete intelligent tasks at the receiver. To verify the effectiveness of the
proposed SCST, it is applied to sentiment analysis and question-answering
tasks, with semantic encoders and decoders designed for each task. Experimental
results show that the proposed SCST achieves at least 43.5% and 52% accuracy
gains, respectively, compared to traditional communication method. These
results demonstrate that the proposed SCST can significantly improve semantic

in Markov games. A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that,
when adopted by all agents and run independently in a decentralized fashion,
lead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results
in normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist
for restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to
deviations to Markovian policies), the question of whether independent
no-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was
open. We provide a decisive negative resolution this problem, both from a
computational and statistical perspective. We show that:
  - Under the widely-believed assumption that PPAD-hard problems cannot be
solved in polynomial time, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains
no-regret in general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all
players, even when the game is known to the algorithm designer and the number
of players is a small constant.
  - When the game is unknown, no algorithm, regardless of computational
efficiency, can achieve no-regret without observing a number of episodes that
is exponential in the number of players.
  Perhaps surprisingly, our lower bounds hold even for seemingly easier setting
in which all agents are controlled by a a centralized algorithm. They are
proven via lower bounds for a simpler problem we refer to as SparseCCE, in
which the goal is to compute a coarse correlated equilibrium that is sparse in
the sense that it can be represented as a mixture of a small number of product
policies. The crux of our approach is a novel application of aggregation
techniques from online learning, whereby we show that any algorithm for the
SparseCCE problem can be used to compute approximate Nash equilibria for

non-uniquely giving rise to actually different modified Dirac equations. To
derive torsion tensor two approaches are used, namely the first of them which
is based on the notion of the generalized Killing-Yano tensors is utilized to
obtain the torsion form in the Einstein frame, whereas the other one appeals to
earlier observations that the torsion form might be identified with the

to modified Dirac equations which even in massive case are separable in
corresponding frames. We have also shown that the generalized massless Dirac
action which gives rise to our torsion-modified Dirac equation is invariant
under conformal rescaling if the spinors are properly rescaled, similarly as it

equations are also separable after conformal rescaling, this rescaling is

matrix sensing is to recover a matrix $A_\star \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$,
based on a sequence of measurements $(u_i,b_i) \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \times
\mathbb{R}$ such that $u_i^\top A_\star u_i = b_i$. Previous work [ZJD15]
focused on the scenario where matrix $A_{\star}$ has a small rank, e.g.
rank-$k$. Their analysis heavily relies on the RIP assumption, making it
unclear how to generalize to high-rank matrices. In this paper, we relax that
rank-$k$ assumption and solve a much more general matrix sensing problem. Given
an accuracy parameter $\delta \in (0,1)$, we can compute $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n

A u_i - b_i| \leq \delta$ for all $i \in [m]$. We design an efficient algorithm
with provable convergence guarantees using stochastic gradient descent for this

choose from, choosing the right APIs is not a simple task. Previous studies on
API recommendation leverage natural language (query) to identify which API
would be suitable for the given task. However, these studies only consider one
source of input, i.e., GitHub or Stack Overflow, independently. There are no
existing approaches that utilize Stack Overflow to help generate better API
sequence recommendations from queries obtained from GitHub. Therefore, in this
study, we aim to provide a framework that could improve the result of the API
sequence recommendation by leveraging information from Stack Overflow. In this
work, we propose PICASO, which leverages a bi-encoder to do contrastive
learning and a cross-encoder to build a classification model in order to find a
semantically similar Stack Overflow post given an annotation (i.e., code
comment). Subsequently, PICASO then uses the Stack Overflow's title as a query
expansion. PICASO then uses the extended queries to fine-tune a CodeBERT,
resulting in an API sequence generation model. Based on our experiments, we
found that incorporating the Stack Overflow information into CodeBERT would
improve the performance of API sequence generation's BLEU-4 score by 10.8%.

However, Lithium (Li) is a limited resource on the planet and is therefore not

multivalent metals such as aluminum (Al) and calcium (Ca) have been actively
researched in battery systems. However, finding suitable intercalation hosts
for multivalent-ion batteries is urgently needed. Open-tunneled oxides are a
particular category of microparticles distinguished by the presence of
integrated one-dimensional channels or nanopores. This work focuses on two
promising open-tunnel oxides, viz: Niobium Tungsten Oxide (NTO) and Molybdenum
Vanadium Oxide (MoVO). We find that the MoVO structure can adsorb greater
numbers of multivalent ions than NTO due to its larger surface area and
different shapes. The MoVO structure can adsorb Ca, Li, and Al ions with
adsorption potential at around 4 to 5 eV. However, the adsorption potential for
hexagonal channels of Al ion drops to 1.73 eV because of less channel area. NTO
structure has an insertion/adsorption potential of 4.4 eV, 3.4 eV, and 0.9 eV
for one Li, Ca, and Al, respectively. In general, Ca ion is more adsorbable
than Al ion in both MoVO and NTO structures. Bader charge analysis and charge
density plot reveals the role of charge transfer and ion size on the insertion
of multivalent ions such as Ca and Al into MoVO and NTO systems. Our results
provide general guidelines to explore other multivalent ions for battery

machine-learning applications and because the integration of quantum devices
based on two-level quantum systems requires such models. The DVAE with RBM
prior, using a relatively simple -- and classically or quantum-mechanically
enhanceable -- sampling technique for the evolution of the RBM's negative

can be easily integrated with quantum sampling by outsourcing its generative

structural links between the classification and regression branches in these
trackers, and the two branches are optimized separately during training.
Therefore, there is a misalignment between the classification and regression

Target Highlight Module is proposed to help the generated similarity response
maps to be more focused on the target region. To reduce the misalignment and
produce more precise tracking results, we propose a corrective loss to train

that affect model bias. In this work, we systematically propose a series of
geometric measurements for perceptual manifolds in deep neural networks, and
then explore the effect of the geometric characteristics of perceptual

characteristics of perceptual manifolds. An unanticipated finding is that the
correlation between the class accuracy and the separation degree of perceptual
manifolds gradually decreases during training, while the negative correlation
with the curvature gradually increases, implying that curvature imbalance leads
to model bias. Therefore, we propose curvature regularization to facilitate the
model to learn curvature-balanced and flatter perceptual manifolds. Evaluations
on multiple long-tailed and non-long-tailed datasets show the excellent
performance and exciting generality of our approach, especially in achieving
significant performance improvements based on current state-of-the-art

because evaluating thermal properties involve a trace over the entire Hilbert
space, which is a formidable task. Besides, excited-state theories are
generally not as well studied as ground-state ones. In this mini-review, we
present an overview of a finite-temperature wave function formalism based on
thermofield dynamics to overcome these difficulties. Thermofield dynamics
allows us to map the equilibrium thermal density matrix to a pure state, i.e.,
a single wave function, albeit in an expanded Hilbert space. Ensemble averages
become expectation values over this so-called thermal state. Around this
thermal state, we have developed a procedure to generalize ground-state wave
function theories to finite temperatures. As explicit examples, we highlight
formulations of mean-field, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster
theories for thermal properties of fermions in the grand-canonical ensemble. To
assess the quality of these approximations, we also show benchmark studies for
the one-dimensional Hubbard model, while comparing against exact results. We
will see that the thermal methods perform similarly to their ground-state
counterparts, while merely adding a pre-factor to the asymptotic computational
cost. They also inherit all the properties, good or bad, from the ground-state
methods, signifying the robustness of our formalism and the scope for future

Transport is organized along pathways abstracted by links, which connect
different nodes as regions to form the network. The modeling of traffic has so
far mainly been based on one-dimensional lattices or networked queuing systems,
which restricts mechanistic insights and analytical tractability for traffic
dynamics on general networks. An interpretable kinetics model is necessary for
understanding the impact of the network structure on traffic congestion in
large-scale networks. Considering a generalized flow-density relation within
each node, we propose and investigate a general traffic model on networks with
external injections and exits. We observe various phases in terms of node
density that exhibit distinct behaviors under different injection rates. The
onset of congestion along with the coexistence of free nodes and congested
nodes, manifested by the spatial localization of traffic congestion, is induced
by the asymmetry of the flow transitions between neighbors in the network. The
proposed congestion centrality allows us to determine the congestion threshold,
identify congested nodes and predict congestion propagation. Our model and
results are shown to cover a broad spectrum of implications for transport
dynamics on networks as well as offer a practical prospect for traffic

containing ties. In addition, a subset of vertices in A U B are marked as
critical and the goal is to output a matching that matches as many critical

literature and in our setting, we seek to compute a matching that is critical
as well as optimal with respect to the preferences of the vertices.
  Stability, which is a well-accepted notion of optimality in the presence of
two-sided preferences, is generalized to weak-stability in the presence of
ties. It is well known that in the presence of critical vertices, a matching
that is critical as well as weakly stable may not exist. Popularity is another
well-investigated notion of optimality for the two-sided preference list
setting, however, in the presence of ties (even with no critical vertices), a
popular matching need not exist. We, therefore, consider the notion of relaxed
stability which was introduced and studied by Krishnaa et. al. (SAGT 2020). We
show that a critical matching which is relaxed stable always exists in our

be NP-hard. Our main contribution is a 3/2 approximation to the maximum-sized

the integration of sensing and communications (ISAC) paradigms to jointly

and low terahertz bands to exploit ultrawide bandwidths. At these frequencies,
hybrid beamformers that employ fewer radio-frequency chains are employed to
offset expensive hardware but at the cost of lower multiplexing gains. Wideband
hybrid beamforming also suffers from the beam-split effect arising from the
subcarrier-independent (SI) analog beamformers. To overcome these limitations,
this paper introduces a spatial path index modulation (SPIM) ISAC architecture,
which transmits additional information bits via modulating the spatial paths
between the base station and communications users. We design the SPIM-ISAC
beamformers by first estimating both radar and communications parameters by
developing beam-split-aware algorithms. Then, we propose to employ a family of
hybrid beamforming techniques such as hybrid, SI, and subcarrier-dependent

It generally depends on the choice of macrovariables, such as the type and
amount of coarse-graining, specifying a non-equilibrium macrostate of the
system, but its extensive part agrees with the thermodynamic entropy in thermal
equilibrium macrostates. We examine two choices of macrovariables: the
$U$-macrovariables are local observables in position space, while the
$f$-macrovariables also include structure in momentum space. For the quantum
gas, we use a non-classical choice of the $f$-macrovariables. For both choices,
the corresponding entropies $s_B^f$ and $s_B^U$ grow and eventually saturate.
As in the classical case, the growth rate of $s_B^f$ depends on the momentum
coarse-graining scale. If the gas is initially at equilibrium and is then
released to expand to occupy twice the initial volume, the per-particle
increase in the entropy for the $f$-macrostate, $\Delta s_B^f$, satisfies

models and train/test these optimization algorithms within real-world ride
sourcing platforms. Acting as a useful test bed, a simulation platform for
ride-sourcing systems will be very important to conduct algorithm
training/testing or model validation through trails and errors. While previous
studies have established a variety of simulators for their own tasks, it lacks
a fair and public platform for comparing the models or algorithms proposed by
different researchers. In addition, the existing simulators still face many
challenges, ranging from their closeness to real environments of ride-sourcing
systems, to the completeness of different tasks they can implement. To address
the challenges, we propose a novel multi-functional and open-sourced simulation
platform for ride-sourcing systems, which can simulate the behaviors and
movements of various agents on a real transportation network. It provides a few
accessible portals for users to train and test various optimization algorithms,
especially reinforcement learning algorithms, for a variety of tasks, including
on-demand matching, idle vehicle repositioning, and dynamic pricing. In
addition, it can be used to test how well the theoretical models approximate
the simulated outcomes. Evaluated on real-world data based experiments, the
simulator is demonstrated to be an efficient and effective test bed for various
tasks related to on-demand ride service operations.

industrial applications. Recently, many methods have been proposed to
synthesize dance motions from music for a single dancer. However, generating

$\rm AIOZ-GDANCE$, a new large-scale dataset for music-driven group dance
generation. Unlike existing datasets that only support single dance, our new
dataset contains group dance videos, hence supporting the study of group
choreography. We propose a semi-autonomous labeling method with humans in the
loop to obtain the 3D ground truth for our dataset. The proposed dataset
consists of 16.7 hours of paired music and 3D motion from in-the-wild videos,
covering 7 dance styles and 16 music genres. We show that naively applying
single dance generation technique to creating group dance motion may lead to
unsatisfactory results, such as inconsistent movements and collisions between
dancers. Based on our new dataset, we propose a new method that takes an input
music sequence and a set of 3D positions of dancers to efficiently produce
multiple group-coherent choreographies. We propose new evaluation metrics for
measuring group dance quality and perform intensive experiments to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method. Our project facilitates future research on

  Spectral Deviation Relationship Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) involves identifying the targets that
deviate spectrally from their surroundings, without prior knowledge. Recently,
deep learning based methods have become the mainstream HAD methods, due to
their powerful spatial-spectral feature extraction ability. However, the
current deep detection models are optimized to complete a proxy task (two-step
paradigm), such as background reconstruction or generation, rather than
achieving anomaly detection directly. This leads to suboptimal results and poor
transferability, which means that the deep model is trained and tested on the
same image. In this paper, an unsupervised transferred direct detection (TDD)
model is proposed, which is optimized directly for the anomaly detection task
(one-step paradigm) and has transferability. Specially, the TDD model is
optimized to identify the spectral deviation relationship according to the
anomaly definition. Compared to learning the specific background distribution
as most models do, the spectral deviation relationship is universal for
different images and guarantees the model transferability. To train the TDD
model in an unsupervised manner, an anomaly sample simulation strategy is
proposed to generate numerous pairs of anomaly samples. Furthermore, a global
self-attention module and a local self-attention module are designed to help
the model focus on the ""spectrally deviating"" relationship. The TDD model was
validated on four public HAD datasets. The results show that the proposed TDD
model can successfully overcome the limitation of traditional model training
and testing on a single image, and the model has a powerful detection ability
and excellent transferability.

two chemical processes, one operating at low temperature (10 K) and the other
at intermediate temperature (20 K). At low temperatures, enabling the hydrogen
abstraction reaction HNO + H -> NO + H2, even in small amounts, partially
inhibits the formation of NH2OH through successive hydrogenation of NO, and
reduces its abundance on the grains. We found that enabling a 15--30 % of
binding sites for this reaction results in reductions of \ce{NH2OH} abundance
of $\sim$ 1-2 orders of magnitude. At warmer temperatures (20 K, in our study),
the reaction NH2OH + H -> HNOH + H2, which was found to be fast
(k$\sim$10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$) in this work, followed by further abstractions by
adsorbates that are immobile at 10 K (O, N) are the main route of \ce{NH2OH}

us to directly train on long videos (3376 frames) to reduce the
training-inference gap, and makes it possible to generate all segments in

that, in the case without magnetic field, the non-organized momentum flux shows
the most pronounced effects near shock front, while the non-organized energy
flux shows the most pronounced behaviors near perturbed interface. The
influence of magnetic field on TNE effects shows stages: before the interface
inverse, the TNE strength is enhanced by reducing the interface inverse speed;
while after the interface inverse, the TNE strength is significantly reduced.

indistinguishability is typically bounded by $L_{\infty}$ or other norms.
However, these norms are not appropriate for measuring indistinguishiability
for time series data. In this work, we propose adversarial examples in the
Wasserstein space for time series data for the first time and utilize
Wasserstein distance to bound the perturbation between normal examples and
adversarial examples. We introduce Wasserstein projected gradient descent
(WPGD), an adversarial attack method for perturbing univariant time series
data. We leverage the closed-form solution of Wasserstein distance in the 1D
space to calculate the projection step of WPGD efficiently with the gradient
descent method. We further propose a two-step projection so that the search of
adversarial examples in the Wasserstein space is guided and constrained by
Euclidean norms to yield more effective and imperceptible perturbations. We
empirically evaluate the proposed attack on several time series datasets in the
healthcare domain. Extensive results demonstrate that the Wasserstein attack is
powerful and can successfully attack most of the target classifiers with a high
attack success rate. To better study the nature of Wasserstein adversarial
example, we evaluate a strong defense mechanism named Wasserstein smoothing for
potential certified robustness defense. Although the defense can achieve some
accuracy gain, it still has limitations in many cases and leaves space for
developing a stronger certified robustness method to Wasserstein adversarial
examples on univariant time series data.

area that is expected to open new routes for laser patterning and a wealth of
exciting applications in optics, photonics, and sensing. In contrast to the
common belief that excitation of Surface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) on the

in both air/metal and metal/substrate interfaces, along with other parameters
such as the thickness of the material, the photon energy, and the substrate
refractive index, dictate the spatial modulation of the absorbed energy. A
detailed theoretical analysis of the excited plasmonic waves and a multiscale

laser conditions and thickness of the irradiated solid, topographies with
periodic features of diverse sizes (ranging from $\lambda_L/3$ to $\lambda_L$,
where $\lambda_L$ stands for the laser wavelength) and different orientation
can be realized. The capability to control and tune the characteristics of the

possible to use safe directed rounding methods, e.g., to generate provably
correct dual bounds. In this work, we continue to leverage this paradigm and
extend an exact branch-and-bound framework by separation routines for safe
cutting planes, based on the approach first introduced by Cook, Dash, Fukasawa,

multipliers from an LP solve, followed by mixed-integer rounding to generate
provably valid, although slightly weaker inequalities. We generalize this
approach to problem data that is not representable in floating-point
arithmetic, add routines for controlling the encoding length of the resulting
cutting planes, and show how these cutting planes can be verified according to
the VIPR certificate standard. Furthermore, we analyze the performance impact
of these cutting planes in the context of an exact MIP framework, showing that

binary anomaly label is only given on the video level, but the output requires

in WSVAD. However, MIL is notoriously known to suffer from many false alarms
because the snippet-level detector is easily biased towards the abnormal

missing the anomaly with a different pattern. To this end, we propose a new MIL

WSVAD. At each MIL training iteration, we use the current detector to divide
the samples into two groups with different context biases: the most confident
abnormal/normal snippets and the rest ambiguous ones. Then, by seeking the

these two action and mode-switching operations can be replicated by imitation
learning with high sample efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes
Disturbance Injection under Partial Automation (DIPA) as a novel imitation
learning framework. In DIPA, mode and actions (in the manual mode) are assumed
to be observables in each state and are used to learn both action and
mode-switching policies. The above learning is robustified by injecting
disturbances into the operator's actions to optimize the disturbance's level

graphene (TBG), at the so-called magic angle (MA), is the emergence of flat
bands around the charge neutrality point. These bands are associated with the
observed superconducting phases and the correlated insulating states occurring
at the MA. Scanning tunneling microscopy combined with angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy are usually used to visualize the flatness of the
band structure of the TGB at the MA. Here, we theoretically argue that spin
pumping (SP) provides a direct probe of the flat bands of TBG and an accurate
determination of the MA. We consider a junction separating a ferromagnetic
insulator and an heterostructure of TBG adjacent to a monolayer of a transition
metal dichalcogenide. We show that the Gilbert damping of the ferromagnetic
resonance experiment through this junction depends on the twist angle of TBG,
and shows a sharp drop at the MA. Our results open the way to a twist
switchable spintronics in twisted van der Waals heterostructures.

quantum circuits for variational quantum algorithms (VQAs). However, existing
QAS algorithms require to evaluate a large number of quantum circuits during
the search process, which makes them computationally demanding and limits their
applications to large-scale quantum circuits. Recently, predictor-based QAS has
been proposed to alleviate this problem by directly estimating the performances
of circuits according to their structures with a predictor trained on a set of
labeled quantum circuits. However, the predictor is trained by purely
supervised learning, which suffers from poor generalization ability when
labeled training circuits are scarce. It is very time-consuming to obtain a
large number of labeled quantum circuits because the gate parameters of quantum
circuits need to be optimized until convergence to obtain their ground-truth
performances. To overcome these limitations, we propose GSQAS, a graph
self-supervised QAS, which trains a predictor based on self-supervised
learning. Specifically, we first pre-train a graph encoder on a large number of
unlabeled quantum circuits using a well-designed pretext task in order to
generate meaningful representations of circuits. Then the downstream predictor
is trained on a small number of quantum circuits' representations and their
labels. Once the encoder is trained, it can apply to different downstream
tasks. In order to better encode the spatial topology information and avoid the
huge dimension of feature vectors for large-scale quantum circuits, we design a
scheme to encode quantum circuits as graphs. Simulation results on searching
circuit structures for variational quantum eigensolver and quantum state
classification show that GSQAS outperforms the state-of-the-art predictor-based
QAS, achieving better performance with fewer labeled circuits.

product line. In industry, feature models are often complex due to a large
number of features and constraints. Thus, a multitude of automated analyses
have been proposed. Many of those rely on computing the number of valid
configurations which typically depends on solving a #SAT problem, a
computationally expensive operation. Further, most counting-based analyses
require numerous #SAT computations on the same feature model. In particular,
many analyses depend on multiple computations for evaluating the number of
valid configurations that include certain features or conform to partial
configurations. Instead of using expensive repetitive computations on highly
similar formulas, we aim to improve the performance by reusing knowledge
between these computations. In this work, we are the first to propose reusing
d-DNNFs for performing efficient repetitive queries on features and partial

correspondences by extracting discriminative local features, and then leverage
estimators (eg. RANSAC) to filter outliers, which are highly dependent on
well-designed descriptors and post-processing choices. To address these
problems, we propose an end-to-end transformer network (RegFormer) for
large-scale point cloud alignment without any further post-processing.
Specifically, a projection-aware hierarchical transformer is proposed to
capture long-range dependencies and filter outliers by extracting point
features globally. Our transformer has linear complexity, which guarantees high
efficiency even for large-scale scenes. Furthermore, to effectively reduce
mismatches, a bijective association transformer is designed for regressing the
initial transformation. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets

address this, we propose a rigidity-aware detection method exploiting the fact

introduce an approach to sampling positive object regions from the entire

yielding better detection robustness. Key to the success of our approach is a
visibility map, which we propose to build using a minimum barrier distance

combined with a pose regression network, we obtain state-of-the-art pose

In contrast, we aim to propose a Unified Collaborative perception framework

achieving higher quality and lower bandwidth. Then, a graph-based collaboration

reconstruction integrates the multi-resolution collaborative features for

enhancement brought by MCP systematically, we introduce a brand-new evaluation
metric that evaluates the MCP from different perspectives. To verify our

branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms that make use of the application of Benders
decomposition method to two different mixed-integer programming formulations of
the MBSMP: an arc-based formulation and a path-based formulation. We show that
for both formulations the Benders optimality cuts can be generated using a
combinatorial procedure rather than solving the dual subproblems using linear

seed sets, initial cuts, and a starting heuristic are also incorporated into
our branch-and-Benders-cut algorithms. We investigate the contribution of
various components of the solution algorithms to the performance on the basis

we investigate the impacts of the IMF on the cloud condition for the GC
formation with the range of the power-law index of IMF as $\gamma = 1-2.35$. We
find that the threshold surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm thr}$) for the GC
formation increases from $800~M_{\odot} \; {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $\gamma = 2.35$ to
$1600~M_{\odot}\; {\rm pc^{-2}}$ at $\gamma = 1.5$ in the cases of clouds with
$M_{\rm cl} = 10^6~M_{\odot}$ because the emissivity of ionizing photons per
stellar mass increases as $\gamma$ decreases. For $\gamma < 1.5$, $\Sigma_{\rm

and observed only in local starburst galaxies due to e.g., merger processes.
Thus, we suggest that formation sites of low-metallicity GCs could be limited
only in the very high-surface density regions. We also find that $\Sigma_{\rm

for model training. However, unlike unimodal datasets, multimodal datasets are
extremely harder to collect and annotate precisely. As an alternative, the
co-occurred data pairs (e.g., image-text pairs) collected from the Internet
have been widely exploited in the area. Unfortunately, the cheaply collected
dataset unavoidably contains many mismatched data pairs, which have been proven
to be harmful to the model's performance. To address this, we propose a general
framework called BiCro (Bidirectional Cross-modal similarity consistency),
which can be easily integrated into existing cross-modal matching models and
improve their robustness against noisy data. Specifically, BiCro aims to
estimate soft labels for noisy data pairs to reflect their true correspondence
degree. The basic idea of BiCro is motivated by that -- taking image-text

be recast as the estimated soft labels to train the matching model. The
experiments on three popular cross-modal matching datasets demonstrate that our

field is properly detuned between the D1 and D2 transitions, an ac Stark shift
of a ground-state atom takes the form of a pure Zeeman shift. We call it the
""analogous Zeeman effect"", and experimentally demonstrated an optical
Stern-Gerlach effect and an optical trap that behaves exactly like a magnetic
trap. By tuning polarization of a trapping beam, and thereby controlling a
shift proportional to \beta, we demonstrated elimination of an inhomogeneous
broadening of a ground hyperfine transition in an optical trap. We call it
""magic polarization"". We also showed significant narrowing of a Raman sideband
transition at a special well depth. A Raman sideband in an optical trap is
broadened owing to anharmonicity of the trap potential, and the broadening can
be eliminated by a beta-induced differential ac Stark shift at what we call a
""magic well depth"". Finally, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a
cooling scheme that incorporated the idea of velocity-selective coherent
population trapping to Raman sideband cooling to enhance cooling efficiency of
the latter outside of the Lamb-Dicke regime. We call it ""motion-selective
coherent population trapping"", and \beta is responsible for the selectivity. We
include a program file that calculates both scalar and vector polarizabilities
of a given alkali-metal atom when the wavelength of an applied field is
specified. It also calculates depth of a potential well and photon-scattering
rate of a trapped atom in a specific ground state when power, minimum spot
size, and polarization of a trap beam are given.

  figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digital image inpainting is an interpolation problem, inferring the content
in the missing (unknown) region to agree with the known region data such that
the interpolated result fulfills some prior knowledge. Low-rank and nonlocal
self-similarity are two important priors for image inpainting. Based on the
nonlocal self-similarity assumption, an image is divided into overlapped square
target patches (submatrices) and the similar patches of any target patch are
reshaped as vectors and stacked into a patch matrix. Such a patch matrix
usually enjoys a property of low rank or approximately low rank, and its
missing entries are recoveried by low-rank matrix approximation (LRMA)
algorithms. Traditionally, $n$ nearest neighbor similar patches are searched
within a local window centered at a target patch. However, for an image with
missing lines, the generated patch matrix is prone to having entirely-missing
rows such that the downstream low-rank model fails to reconstruct it well. To
address this problem, we propose a region-wise matching (RwM) algorithm by
dividing the neighborhood of a target patch into multiple subregions and then
search the most similar one within each subregion. A non-convex weighted
low-rank decomposition (NC-WLRD) model for LRMA is also proposed to reconstruct
all degraded patch matrices grouped by the proposed RwM algorithm. We solve the
proposed NC-WLRD model by the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) and analyze the convergence in detail. Numerous experiments on line
inpainting (entire-row/column missing) demonstrate the superiority of our
method over other competitive inpainting algorithms. Unlike other
low-rank-based matrix completion methods and inpainting algorithms, the
proposed model NC-WLRD is also effective for removing random-valued impulse
noise and structural noise (stripes).

language. Although significant progress has been made, there is still much room
to improve the performance for real-world applications, mainly due to the
long-tail words challenge. In this paper, we propose a text with knowledge
graph augmented transformer (TextKG) for video captioning. Notably, TextKG is a
two-stream transformer, formed by the external stream and internal stream. The
external stream is designed to absorb additional knowledge, which models the
interactions between the additional knowledge, e.g., pre-built knowledge graph,
and the built-in information of videos, e.g., the salient object regions,
speech transcripts, and video captions, to mitigate the long-tail words
challenge. Meanwhile, the internal stream is designed to exploit the
multi-modality information in videos (e.g., the appearance of video frames,
speech transcripts, and video captions) to ensure the quality of caption
results. In addition, the cross attention mechanism is also used in between the
two streams for sharing information. In this way, the two streams can help each
other for more accurate results. Extensive experiments conducted on four
challenging video captioning datasets, i.e., YouCookII, ActivityNet Captions,
MSRVTT, and MSVD, demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably
against the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, the proposed TextKG method
outperforms the best published results by improving 18.7% absolute CIDEr scores

that couples other, non-interacting systems. Often the mediator itself is not
directly accessible to experimentation, yet it is interesting and sometimes
crucial to understand if it admits non-classical properties. An example of this
sort that recently enjoys considerable attention are two quantum masses coupled
via gravitational field. It has been argued that the gain of quantum
entanglement between the masses indicates non-classical states of the whole
tripartite system. Here, we focus on non-classical properties of the involved
interactions rather than the involved states. We derive inequalities whose
violation indicates non-commutativity and non-decomposability (open system
generalisation of non-commuting unitaries) of interactions through the
mediators. The derivations are based on properties of general quantum formalism
and make minimalistic assumptions about the studied systems, in particular the
interactions can remain uncharacterised throughout the assessment. Furthermore,
we also present conditions that solely use correlations between the coupled
systems, excluding the need to measure the mediator. Next, we show that the
amount of violation places a lower bound on suitably defined degree of
non-decomposability. This makes the methods quantitative and at the same time
experiment ready. We give applications of these techniques in two different
fields: for detecting non-classicality of gravitational interaction and in
bounding the Trotter error in quantum simulations.

decision-making and service delivery, it also poses significant ethical issues
around confidentiality and privacy. Text anonymisation tries to prune and/or
mask identifiable information from a text while keeping the remaining content
intact to alleviate privacy concerns. Text anonymisation is especially
important in industries like healthcare, law, as well as research, where
sensitive and personal information is collected, processed, and exchanged under
high legal and ethical standards.
  Although text anonymization is widely adopted in practice, it continues to
face considerable challenges. The most significant challenge is striking a
balance between removing information to protect individuals' privacy while
maintaining the text's usability for future purposes. The question is whether
these anonymisation methods sufficiently reduce the risk of re-identification,
in which an individual can be identified based on the remaining information in
the text.
  In this work, we challenge the effectiveness of these methods and how we
perceive identifiers. We assess the efficacy of these methods against the
elephant in the room, the use of AI over big data. While most of the research
is focused on identifying and removing personal information, there is limited
discussion on whether the remaining information is sufficient to deanonymise
individuals and, more precisely, who can do it. To this end, we conduct an
experiment using GPT over anonymised texts of famous people to determine
whether such trained networks can deanonymise them. The latter allows us to
revise these methods and introduce a novel methodology that employs Large

method to derive this relation using the nebular spectra of SESNe, based on the
correlation between the [O~I]/[Ca~II], which is an indicator of the progenitor
mass, and the width of [O~I], which measures the expansion velocity of the
oxygen-rich material. To explain the correlation, the kinetic energy ($E_{\rm

represented by the CO core mass ($M_{\rm CO}$). We demonstrate that SNe IIb/Ib
and SNe Ic/Ic-BL follow the same $M_{\rm CO}$-$E_{\rm K}$ scaling relation,
which suggests the helium-rich and helium-deficient SNe share the same
explosion mechanism. The $M_{\rm CO}$-$E_{\rm K}$ relation derived in this work
is compared with the ones from early phase observations. The results are
largely in good agreement. Combined with early phase observation, the method
presented in this work provides a chance to scan through the ejecta from the

Five of the 12 PMOs show definitive evidence of excess, implying a disk
fraction of 42%, albeit with a large statistical uncertainty given the small
sample. Comparing with measurements for higher-mass objects, the disk fraction
does not decline substantially with decreasing mass in the sub-stellar domain,

to form their own miniature planetary systems. We note that only one of the six

not clear yet whether even lower mass objects harbor disks. If not, it may
indicate that ~10 MJup is the lower mass limit for objects that form like

explain the highest kinetic energies observed in the class of hypernovae. On
longer time scales, rotation and magnetic fields can play an important role in
the engine of long gamma-ray burst powered by proto-magnetars or hyperaccreting
black holes in collapsars. Both classes of events are characterized by
relativistic jets and winds driven by neutrinos or magnetic spin-down of the

recruits skilled workers to perform location-dependent tasks. A number of
mature incentive mechanisms have been proposed to address the worker

large enough worker pool and a sufficient number of users can be selected. This
may be impossible in large-scale crowdsourcing environments. To address this
challenge, we consider the MCS system defined on a location-aware social
network provided by a social platform. In this system, we can recruit a small
number of seed workers from the existing worker pool to spread the information
of multiple tasks in the social network, thus attracting more users to perform
tasks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Diffusion Maximization (MT-DM)

for non-linear dynamics to become a linear controllable system. This greatly
simplifies the control synthesis since in the flat output space, the dynamics
appear in canonical form (as chains of integrators). The caveat is that mapping
from the original to the flat output space often leads to nonlinear
constraints. In particular, the alteration of the feasible input set greatly
hinders the subsequent calculations. In this paper, we particularize the
problem for the case of the quadcopter dynamics and investigate the deformed
input constraint set. An optimization-based procedure will achieve a
non-conservative, linear, inner-approximation of the non-convex, flat-output
derived, input constraints. Consequently, a receding horizon problem (linear in
the flat output space) is easily solved and, via the inverse flat mapping,
provides a feasible input to the original, nonlinear, dynamics. Experimental

to perform Bayesian bi-level variable selection in a generalized linear model,
for datasets that may be large both in terms of the number of individuals and
the number of predictors. Our algorithm relies on the waste-free SMC Sequential
Monte Carlo methodology of Dau and Chopin (2022), a new proposal mechanism to
deal with the constraints specific to bi-level selection (which forbid to
select an individual predictor if its group is not selected), and the ALA
(approximate Laplace approximation) approach of Rossell et al. (2021). We show
in our numerical study that the algorithm may offer reliable performance on
large datasets within a few minutes, on both simulated data and real data
related to the aforementioned cardiology application.

crucial for novel desalination, chemical separation, and sensing technologies.
However, fabrication of precisely controlled fluidic channels in the angstrom

nanofluidic transport, hinders practical applications. Here, we fabricated
high-quality salt-intercalated vermiculite membranes with channel sizes 3-5
Angstrom, highly dependent on intercalant. Unlike pristine samples, the
salt-intercalated membranes are highly stable in water. We tested several such
membranes, of which 0.6 micron thick membranes showed dye rejection
efficiencies greater than 98 percent with exceptionally high water permeance of
5400 L m-2 h-1 bar-1 at a differential pressure of 0.9 bar. Interestingly, the
same membrane also rejected NaCl ions, with efficiencies of 95 percent. Our
highly confined channels exhibit sub-linear ionic conductance related to
hydration sizes, steric exclusion, K+ mobility enhancement, and conductance
saturation at concentrations less than or equal to 10 mM. This makes highly
confined channels interesting for both fundamental science and applications.

that the existence of nontrivial solutions implies that the theory is

narrow down conditions for which there could exist a de Sitter inflationary

engineered and incorporated into these materials during processing. However,
optimizing and characterizing these defects is very challenging in practice,
making computational modelling an indispensable complementary tool. We have
developed an automated workflow and code to accelerate these calculations
(AiiDA-defects), which utilises the AiiDA framework, a robust open-source
high-throughput materials informatics infrastructure that provides workflow
automation while simultaneously preserving and storing the full data provenance
in a relational database that is queryable and traversable. This paper
describes the design and implementation details of AiiDA-defects, the models
and algorithms used, and demonstrates its use in an application to fully
characterize the defect chemistry of the well known solid-state Li-ion
conductors LiZnPS 4 . We anticipate that AiiDA-defects will be useful as a tool
for fully automated and reproducible defect calculations, allowing detailed
defect chemistry to be obtained in a reliable and high-throughput way, and
paving the way toward the generation of defects databases for accelerated

propose an efficient hybrid beamforming (HBF) design to mitigate the beam

multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems operating at terahertz band. We first analyze
the array gain and derive the closed-form beam squint ratio that characterizes
the severity of the beam squint effect on UPAs. The effect is shown to be more
severe with a higher fractional bandwidth, while it can be significantly
mitigated when the shape of a UPA approaches a square. We then focus on the HBF
design that maximizes the system spectral efficiency. The design problem is
challenging due to the frequency-flat nature and hardware constraints of the
analog beamformer. We overcome the challenges by proposing an efficient
decoupling design in which the digital and analog beamformers admit closed-form
solutions, which facilitate practical implementations. Numerical results
validate our analysis and show that the proposed HBF design is robust to beam
squint, and thus, it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in wideband

metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs) with metallicities of $0.015-0.195~Z_\odot$ and low
stellar masses of $10^4-10^8~M_\odot$ in the local universe. We conduct deep
optical integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) for the low-mass EMPGs with the
medium high resolution ($R=7500$) grism of the 8m-Subaru FOCAS IFU instrument
by the EMPRESS 3D survey, and investigate H$\alpha$ emission of the EMPGs.
Exploiting the resolution high enough for the low-mass galaxies, we derive gas
dynamics with the H$\alpha$ lines by the fitting of 3-dimensional disk models.
We obtain an average maximum rotation velocity ($v_\mathrm{rot}$) of
$15\pm3~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and an average intrinsic velocity dispersion
($\sigma_0$) of $27\pm10~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ for 15 spatially resolved EMPGs
out of the 33 EMPGs, and find that all of the 15 EMPGs have
$v_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_0<1$ suggesting dispersion dominated systems. There is a
clear decreasing trend of $v_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_0$ with the decreasing stellar
mass and metallicity. We derive the gas mass fraction ($f_\mathrm{gas}$) for
all of the 33 EMPGs, and find no clear dependence on stellar mass and
metallicity. These $v_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_0$ and $f_\mathrm{gas}$ trends should
be compared with young high-$z$ galaxies observed by the forthcoming JWST IFS
programs to understand the physical origins of the EMPGs in the local universe.

(PD-NOMA), Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), and spectrum underlay for
dynamic spectrum access. In this paper, we show that estimating the windowing
applied at the transmitter is important to that cancellation. Windowing at the
transmitter is a popular means to control the bandwidth of an Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplexed (OFDM) symbol and is overlooked in most
literature on OFDM signal cancellation. We show the limitation to the amount of
cancellation that can be achieved without knowledge of OFDM windowing. We show
that the window can be estimated from received samples alone, and that window
estimate can be used to improve the signal cancellation. The window is
estimated in the presence of noise and imperfect estimates of the center
frequency offset (CFO) and the channel. We conclude with results using
synthetic and over-the-air data where we demonstrate a 5.3 dB improvement to
OFDM signal cancellation over existing methods in an over-the-air experiment.

this paper, we analyze the Twitter traffic related to the US 2020 pre-election
debate and ask whether it mirrors the electoral system. The U.S. electoral
system provides that, regardless of the actual vote gap, the premier candidate
who received more votes in one state `takes' that state. Criticisms of this
system have pointed out that election campaigns can be more intense in
particular key states to achieve victory, so-called {\it swing states}. Our
intuition is that election debate may cause more traffic on Twitter-and
probably be more plagued by misinformation-when associated with swing states.
The results mostly confirm the intuition. About 88\% of the entire traffic can
be associated with swing states, and links to non-trustworthy news are shared
far more in swing-related traffic than the same type of news in safe-related
traffic. Considering traffic origin instead, non-trustworthy tweets generated
by automated accounts, so-called social bots, are mostly associated with swing
states. Our work sheds light on the role an electoral system plays in the
evolution of online debates, with, in the spotlight, disinformation and social

replacing the LL resummation in the branching process by a single splitting

optimization schemes, CSG does not discard old gradient samples from previous
iterations. Instead, design dependent integration weights are calculated to
form a linear combination as an approximation to the true gradient at the
current design. As the approximation error vanishes in the course of the
iterations, CSG represents a hybrid approach, starting off like a purely
stochastic method and behaving like a full gradient scheme in the limit. In
this work, the efficiency of CSG is demonstrated for practically relevant
applications from topology optimization. These settings are characterized by
both, a large number of optimization variables \textit{and} an objective
function, whose evaluation requires the numerical computation of multiple
integrals concatenated in a nonlinear fashion. Such problems could not be
solved by any existing optimization method before. Lastly, with regards to

control networks in different timescales to optimize the long-term spectrum

the optimization problem into two sub-problems, AP-UT association (AUA) as well

process (MDP) and Partially Observable MDP (POMDP). The proposed method
consists of two neural networks. At the system level, a distributed high-level
neural network is introduced to optimize wireless network structure on a large

proposed to mitigate inter-AP interference and improve the transmission
performance on a small timescale. Numerical results show that our method is
effective for high-dimensional problems, in terms of spectrum efficiency,
signaling overhead as well as satisfaction probability, and generalize well to
diverse multi-object problems.

through a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), and thus reveals the
properties of QCD matter at extremely high density and temperature. By
combining a next-to-leading order perturbative QCD calculation of parton
production, a general ansatz of parton energy loss functions and parton
fragmentation functions, we calculate the nuclear modification of various
hadron species -- charged hadrons, $D$ mesons and $B$-decayed $J/\psi$ -- over
a wide transverse momentum regime. Comparing our calculations to the
experimental data using the Bayesian statistical analysis, we perform a first
simultaneous extraction of the energy loss functions of gluons ($g$), light
quarks ($q$), charm quarks ($c$) and bottom quarks ($b$) inside the QGP. We
find that the average parton energy loss at high energies follows the expected
hierarchy of $\langle \Delta E_g \rangle > \langle \Delta E_q \rangle \sim
\langle \Delta E_c \rangle > \langle \Delta E_b \rangle$, while the parton
energy loss distribution can further test the QCD calculations of parton
interaction with the dense nuclear matter. We also find that the reduction of
experimental uncertainties can significantly improve the precision of the
extracted parton energy loss functions inside the QGP.

calculations is performed in a large parameter space of quadrupole and
hexadecapole deformations ($\beta_{2}$ and $\beta_{4}$) of $^{28}$Si. Our

$\beta_{2}$=-$0.38 \pm 0.01$ which is in excellent agreement with
electromagnetic probes. A precise value of hexadecapole deformation for
$^{28}$Si, $\beta_{4}$=+$0.03 \pm 0.01$, along with a consistent value of
quadrupole deformation has now been determined for the first time using QEL
scattering. A remarkable agreement between the experimental $\beta_{4}$ value
of $^{28}$Si and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock based calculations is obtained. The QEL
results obtained previously for $^{24}$Mg (prolate) and the present result for

is a natural approach for converting information symbols multiplexed in the DD
domain directly to time domain for transmission, and vice versa at the
receiver. Past research on OTFS has primarily considered a two-step approach
where DD domain symbols are first converted to time-frequency domain which are
then converted to time domain for transmission, and vice versa at the receiver.
The Zak transform approach can offer performance and complexity benefits
compared to the two-step approach. This paper presents an early investigation
on the bit error performance of OTFS realized using discrete Zak transform
(DZT). We develop a compact DD domain input-output relation for DZT-OTFS using
matrix decomposition that is valid for both integer and fractional
delay-Dopplers. We analyze the bit error performance of DZT-OTFS using pairwise
error probability analysis and simulations. Simulation results show that 1)
both DZT-OTFS and two-step OTFS perform better than OFDM, and 2) DZT-OTFS
achieves better performance compared to two-step OTFS over a wide range of
Doppler spreads.

lower bounding the Bayesian risk. The method allows for the use of virtually
\emph{any} information measure, including R\'enyi's $\alpha$,
$\varphi$-Divergences, and Sibson's $\alpha$-Mutual Information. The approach
considers divergences as functionals of measures and exploits the duality
between spaces of measures and spaces of functions. In particular, we show that
one can lower bound the risk with any information measure by upper bounding its
dual via Markov's inequality. We are thus able to provide estimator-independent
impossibility results thanks to the Data-Processing Inequalities that
divergences satisfy. The results are then applied to settings of interest
involving both discrete and continuous parameters, including the
``Hide-and-Seek'' problem, and compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. An
important observation is that the behaviour of the lower bound in the number of
samples is influenced by the choice of the information measure. We leverage
this by introducing a new divergence inspired by the ``Hockey-Stick''
Divergence, which is demonstrated empirically to provide the largest
lower-bound across all considered settings. If the observations are subject to
privatisation, stronger impossibility results can be obtained via Strong
Data-Processing Inequalities. The paper also discusses some generalisations and

automatic manner. Semantic perception mostly relies on deep learning using
supervised approaches, which require time and qualified workers to label fairly
large amounts of data. In this paper, we look into the problem of reducing the
amount of labels without compromising the final segmentation performance. For
robots operating in the field, pre-training networks in a supervised way is
already a popular method to reduce the number of required labeled images. We
investigate the possibility of pre-training in a self-supervised fashion using
data from the target domain. To better exploit this data, we propose a set of
domain-specific augmentation strategies. We evaluate our pre-training on
semantic segmentation and leaf instance segmentation, two important tasks in
our domain. The experimental results suggest that pre-training with
domain-specific data paired with our data augmentation strategy leads to
superior performance compared to commonly used pre-trainings. Furthermore, the
pre-trained networks obtain similar performance to the fully supervised with

of visual and textual modalities into a common latent space. Prior works have
attempted to address this challenge by leveraging separately pre-trained
unimodal models to extract visual and textual features. However, these
approaches lack the necessary underlying alignment capabilities required to
match multimodal data effectively. Besides, these works use prior information
to explore explicit part alignments, which may lead to the distortion of
intra-modality information. To alleviate these issues, we present IRRA: a
cross-modal Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework that learns
relations between local visual-textual tokens and enhances global image-text
matching without requiring additional prior supervision. Specifically, we first
design an Implicit Relation Reasoning module in a masked language modeling
paradigm. This achieves cross-modal interaction by integrating the visual cues
into the textual tokens with a cross-modal multimodal interaction encoder.
Secondly, to globally align the visual and textual embeddings, Similarity
Distribution Matching is proposed to minimize the KL divergence between
image-text similarity distributions and the normalized label matching
distributions. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all

reliability. However, they only allow a rater to select exactly one category
for each subject. This is a severe limitation in some research contexts: for
example, measuring the inter-rater reliability of a group of psychiatrists
diagnosing patients into multiple disorders is impossible with these measures.
This paper proposes a generalisation of the Fleiss' kappa coefficient that
lifts this limitation. Specifically, the proposed $\kappa$ statistic measures
inter-rater reliability between multiple raters classifying subjects into
one-or-more nominal categories. These categories can be weighted according to
their importance, and the measure can take into account the category hierarchy
(e.g., categories consisting of subcategories that are only available when
choosing the main category like a primary psychiatric disorder and
sub-disorders; but much more complex dependencies between categories are
possible as well). The proposed $\kappa$ statistic can handle missing data and
a varying number of raters for subjects or categories. The paper briefly
overviews existing methods allowing raters to classify subjects into multiple
categories. Next, we derive our proposed measure step-by-step and prove that
the proposed measure equals Fleiss' kappa when a fixed number of raters chose
one category for each subject. The measure was developed to investigate the
reliability of a new mathematics assessment method, of which an example is
elaborated. The paper concludes with the worked-out example of psychiatrists
diagnosing patients into multiple disorders.

real-valued random variables in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable
law, $\alpha\in (0,2]$, with emphasis on the case $\alpha=2$. There are two
different scenarios: either the deviation is realised via a collective
behaviour with all summands contributing to the deviation (a Gaussian
scenario), or a single summand is atypically large and contributes to the
deviation (a one-big-jump scenario). Such results are known when $\alpha \in
(0,2)$ (large deviations always follow a one big-jump scenario) or when the
random variables admit a moment of order $2+\delta$ for some $\delta>0$. We
extend these results, including in particular the case where the right tail is
regularly varying with index $-2$ (treating cases with infinite variance in the
domain of attraction of the normal law). We identify the threshold for the
transition between the Gaussian and the one-big-jump regimes; it is slightly
larger when considering local large deviations compared to integral large
deviations. Additionally, we complement our results by describing the behaviour
of the sum and of the largest summand conditionally on a (local) large
deviation, for any $\alpha\in (0,2]$, both in the Gaussian and in the
one-big-jump regimes. As an application, we show how our results can be used in
the study of condensation phenomenon in the zero-range process at the critical

employed in fair division applications. In leximin optimization, one first aims
to maximize the smallest objective value; subject to this, one maximizes the
second-smallest objective; and so on. Often, even the single-objective problem
of maximizing the smallest value cannot be solved accurately. What can we hope
to accomplish for leximin optimization in this situation? Recently, Henzinger
et al. (2022) defined a notion of \emph{approximate} leximin optimality. Their
definition, however, considers only an additive approximation.
  In this work, we first define the notion of approximate leximin optimality,
allowing both multiplicative and additive errors. We then show how to compute,
in polynomial time, such an approximate leximin solution, using an oracle that
finds an approximation to a single-objective problem. The approximation factors
of the algorithms are closely related: an $(\alpha,\epsilon)$-approximation for
the single-objective problem (where $\alpha \in (0,1]$ and $\epsilon \geq 0$
are the multiplicative and additive factors respectively) translates into an
$\left(\frac{\alpha^2}{1-\alpha + \alpha^2}, \frac{\epsilon}{1-\alpha
+\alpha^2}\right)$-approximation for the multi-objective leximin problem,
regardless of the number of objectives.
  Finally, we apply our algorithm to obtain an approximate leximin solution for
the problem of \emph{stochastic allocations of indivisible goods}. For this
problem, assuming sub-modular objectives functions, the single-objective
egalitarian welfare can be approximated, with only a multiplicative error, to
an optimal $1-\frac{1}{e}\approx 0.632$ factor w.h.p. We show how to extend the
approximation to leximin, over all the objective functions, to a multiplicative
factor of $\frac{(e-1)^2}{e^2-e+1} \approx 0.52$ w.h.p or $\frac{1}{3}$
deterministically.

their performance is still limited, especially against online commercial FR

on average). Motivated by this, we present Sibling-Attack, a new FR attack
technique for the first time explores a novel multi-task perspective (i.e.,
leveraging extra information from multi-correlated tasks to boost attacking

Sibling-Attack based on theoretical and quantitative analysis. Sibling-Attack
then develops an optimization framework that fuses adversarial gradient

to any electromagnetic-based treatments, ranging from reheating meals in a

intrinsically temperature-dependent. In this work, we explore various methods

MHz to 20 GHz), to cover RF and microwave frequencies, as well as understand
the impact of ingredients (e.g. salt, sugar) and temperature on free and bound

yielded global measurements of sea surface temperature (SST). With a resolution
of approximately 1km, these data trace physical processes like western boundary
currents, cool upwelling at eastern boundary currents, and the formation of
mesoscale and sub-mesoscale eddies. To discover the fundamental patterns of SST
on scales smaller than 10km, we developed an unsupervised, deep contrastive
learning model named Nenya. We trained Nenya on a subset of 8 million
cloud-free cutout images (~80x80km^2) from the MODIS sensor, with image
augmentations to impose invariance to rotation, reflection, and translation.
The 256-dimension latent space of Nenya defines a vocabulary to describe the
complexity of SST and associates images with like patterns and features. We
used a dimensionality reduction algorithm to explore cutouts with a temperature
interval of DT=0.5-1K, identifying a diverse set of patterns with temperature
variance on a wide range of scales. We then demonstrated that SST data with
large-scale features arise preferentially in the Pacific and Atlantic
Equatorial Cold Tongues and exhibit a strong seasonal variation, while data
with predominantly sub-mesoscale structure preferentially manifest in western
boundary currents, select regions with strong upwelling, and along the
Antarctic Circumpolar Current. We provide a web-based user interface to
facilitate the geographical and temporal exploration of the full MODIS dataset.
Future efforts will link specific SST patterns to select dynamics (e.g.,

phenotypes could be understood as a result of the metabolic interaction network

problem using metabolomics data for the inverse calculation of a biochemical
Jacobian network. However, these algorithms for this inference are limited by
two issues: they rely on structural network information that needs to be
assembled manually, and they are numerically unstable due to ill-conditioned
regression problems, which makes them inadequate for dealing with large-scale
metabolic networks. In this work, we present a novel regression-loss based
inverse Jacobian algorithm and related workflow COVRECON. It consists of two

Sim-Network automatically generates an organism-specific enzyme and reaction
dataset from Bigg and KEGG databases, which is then used to reconstruct the
Jacobian's structure for a specific metabolomics dataset. Instead of directly
solving a regression problem, the new inverse differential Jacobian part is
based on a more robust approach and rates the biochemical interactions
according to their relevance from large-scale metabolomics data. This approach
is illustrated by in silico stochastic analysis with different-sized metabolic
networks from the BioModels database. The advantages of COVRECON are that 1) it
automatically reconstructs a data-driven superpathway metabolic interaction

ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, Carina II and Reticulum II, both satellites of the

initial mass function as star formation proceeds in different gas cells of the
galaxy volume. We account for the chemical enrichment of Supernova bubbles as
they spread in the interstellar medium, causing dispersion in the elemental
abundances. We recreate the abundance patterns of $\alpha$- and
odd-$\textit{Z}$ elements, predicting two sequences in [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] at all
metallicities. Our models underestimate [C/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] because of the large
uncertainty in the adopted stellar nucleosynthesis yields. We discuss that the
observed C and N abundances had likely been affected by internal mixing
processes, which changed the initial surface abundances in the red giants. Our
Supernova feedback scheme is responsible for driving galactic outflows, which
quench the star formation activity at early times. We predict an average

textureless and incomplete, which hinders effective appearance matching.
Besides, previous methods greatly overlook the critical motion clues among

motion-centric paradigm to handle LiDAR SOT from a new perspective. Following
this paradigm, we propose a matching-free two-stage tracker M^2-Track. At the
1st-stage, M^2-Track localizes the target within successive frames via motion
transformation. Then it refines the target box through motion-assisted shape

its impressive generalizability with limited training labels and provides good
differentiability for end-to-end cycle training. This inspires us to explore
semi-supervised LiDAR SOT by incorporating a pseudo-label-based motion
augmentation and a self-supervised loss term. Under the fully-supervised
setting, extensive experiments confirm that M^2-Track significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-arts on three large-scale datasets while running at 57FPS

galaxy NGC4151. The source has been observed with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE) for 700 ks, complemented with simultaneous XMM-Newton (50 ks)

and angle ${\Psi}= 86{\deg} {\pm} 7{\deg}$ east of north ($68\%$ confidence
level) are measured in the 2-8 keV energy range. The spectro-polarimetric
analysis shows that the polarization could be entirely due to reflection. Given
the low reflection flux in the IXPE band, this requires however a reflection
with a very large ($> 38 \%$) polarization degree. Assuming more reasonable
values, a polarization degree of the hot corona ranging from ${\sim}4$ to
${\sim}8\%$ is found. The observed polarization degree excludes a spherical
lamppost geometry for the corona, suggesting instead a slab-like geometry,
possibly a wedge, as determined via Monte Carlo simulations. This is further
confirmed by the X-ray polarization angle, which coincides with the direction
of the extended radio emission in this source, supposed to match the disc axis.
NGC4151 is the first AGN with an X-ray polarization measure for the corona,
illustrating the capabilities of X-ray polarimetry and IXPE in unveiling its
geometry.

is a common astrophysical phenomenon (such as Gamma-ray bursts and the Crab
pulsar) and may serve as a key probe to the underlying radiation mechanism.
However, spectral lag in keV range of the magnetar bursts has not been
systematically studied yet. In this work, we perform a detailed spectral lag
analysis with the Li-CCF method for SGR J1935+2154 bursts observed by {\it
Insight}-HXMT, GECAM and Fermi/GBM from July 2014 to Jan 2022. We discover that
the spectral lags of about 61\% (non-zero significance >1$\sigma$) bursts from
SGR J1935+2154 are linearly dependent on the photon energy ($E$) with $t_{\rm
lag}(E)=\alpha (E/{\rm keV})+C$, which may be explained by a linear change of
the temperature of the blackbody-emitting plasma with time. The distribution of
the slope ($\alpha$) approximately follows a Gaussian function with mean and
standard deviation of 0.02 ms/keV (i.e. high-energy photons arrive earlier) and
0.02 ms/keV, respectively. We also find that the distribution can be well
fitted with three Gaussians with mean values of $\sim$ -0.009, 0.013 and 0.039
ms/keV, which may correspond to different origins of the bursts. These spectral
lag features may have important implications on the magnetar bursts.

resonance line, that is usually implemented by finding a best fit to the
spectrum by a line-shape function. Such an iterative procedure is slow and
requires an initial guess. We report an analytical method for calculating the
central frequency of a spectral line by using the mean value of its
frequencies, which are weighted by corresponding normalized intensities. We use
this method to calculate two-dimensional arrays of central frequencies from
parallely measured magnetic resonance spectra, which are optically detected by
a camera sensor in a thin layer of NV centers with superparamagnetic hemozoin
crystals on top of it. We demonstrate that our analytical method is more than
800 times faster than the fitting procedure without significant loss of
accuracy. For a 400x400 pixels sensing array, this method is almost
instantaneous, while fitting with the Lorentz function requires several minutes
of post-processing on a 4-core MacBook Pro. When a resonance is beyond the
spectral range, the amplitude-weighted-mean method does not fail, but it
alternates its center frequency proportionally to the mismatch distance. Our
method will be useful for spectroscopic applications that require high
performance of data processing, allowing their fast optimization, inline
processing and real-time output of results. It can also be used for automatic
analysis of single spectra, when accuracy of the frequency detection could be
slightly (<10%) reduced for sake of stability and simplicity of the data
processing.

viscosity. While several methods are able to measure this parameter globally
(AFM, surface acoustic waves, DLS, ...), very few can provide high resolution
viscosity images, particularly in living cells. Here, we propose to use
sub-micrometer magnetic rods to perform high resolution viscosity imaging. An
external magnetic field forces the oscillation of superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanorods. Under linearly polarized illumination, the rotation of these highly
anisotropic optical scatterers induces a blinking which is analyzed by
heterodyne holography. The spectral analysis of the rotation dynamics yields a
regime transition frequency f t from which the local viscosity is deduced.
Holography provides 3D image reconstruction and 3D superlocalization of the
nanorods, which allows super-resolved viscosity measurements. Relying on the
fast Brownian rotation of nanorods instead of their slower translation
therefore allows faster measurements and, crucially, smaller effective voxels
for viscosity determination. Viscosity imaging is demonstrated with a 0.5

energetically very close to an antiferrodistortive phase obtained by
condensation of a soft phonon mode at the R point of the Brillouin zone
boundary. In this work, we report a combined experimental and theoretical study
of the temperature dependence of this soft phonon mode. Inelastic neutron and
x-ray scattering measurements on single crystals show that it softens
substantially from \SI{9.4}{\meV} at room temperature to \SI{5.6}{\meV} at
\SI{2}{\K}. In contrast, the acoustic mode at the same R point is nearly
temperature independent. The effect of the anharmonicity on the lattice
dynamics is investigated non-perturbatively using direct dynamic simulations as
well as a first-principles based self-consistent phonon theory, including
quantum fluctuations of the atomic motion. By adding cubic and quartic
anharmonic force constants, quantitative agreement with the neutron data for
the temperature dependence of the antiferrodistortive mode is obtained. The
quantum fluctuations of the atomic motion are found to be important to obtain
the proper temperature dependence at low temperatures. The mean squared
displacements of the different atoms are determined as function of temperature
and are shown to be consistent with available experimental data. Adding
anharmonicity to the computed fluctuations of the Ba-O distances also improves
the comparison with available EXAFS data at \SI{300}{\K}.

$\mathcal F \mathcal M$ of absolute flat Mittag-Leffler modules: either as
their restricted versions (lying between $\mathcal P _0$ and $\mathcal F

$\mathcal F _0$). In this survey, we will deal with applications of these
classes in relative homological algebra and algebraic geometry.
  The classes $\mathcal P _0$ and $\mathcal F _0$ are known to provide for
approximations, and minimal approximations, respectively. We will show that the
classes of restricted flat relative Mittag-Leffler modules, and flat relative
Mittag-Leffler modules, have rather different approximation properties: the
former classes always provide for approximations, but the latter do not, except
for the boundary case of $\mathcal F _0$.
  The notion of an (infinite dimensional) vector bundle is known to be Zariski
local for all schemes, the key point of the proof being that projectivity
ascends and descends along flat and faithfully flat ring homomorphisms,
respectively. We will see that the same holds for the properties of being a
$\kappa$-restricted flat Mittag-Leffler module for each cardinal $\kappa \geq
\aleph_0$, and also a flat $\mathcal Q$-Mittag-Leffler module whenever
$\mathcal Q$ is a definable class of finite type. Thus, as in the model case of
vector bundles, Zariski locality holds for flat quasi-coherent sheaves induced
by each of these classes of modules. Moreover, we will see that the notion of a

by a flat plate with a serrated edge. The scattered pressure is solved using
the Wiener-Hopf technique in conjunction with the adjoint technique. It is
shown that the kernel decomposition proposed in recent literature appears only
valid at high frequencies. We focus on this high-frequency regime and obtain
the scattered pressure in the form of a contour integral. We show that such an
integral, although complicated, can be evaluated exactly for any arbitrary
piecewise linear serrations, for which closed-form analytical Green's functions
are obtained. The derivation is validated by performing numerical integration
of the contour integral showing excellent agreement. The Green's function is
shown to agree well with the numerical results obtained using the finite
element method at high frequencies. The noise directivity patterns are studied
as a function of the frequency, serration amplitude, source position and Mach
number respectively. It is found that noise is often enhanced at low and may be
slightly reduced at high observer angles, which may be understood from the
perspective of an extended or removed rigid reflection surface. It is found
that increasing the mean-flow Mach number leads to increasingly evident noise
amplification at side angles, a seemingly strange Doppler behaviour exhibited
in source-fixed coordinate frames. The analytical Green's function is
applicable to both leading- and trailing-edge scatterings, and is particularly
suitable for developing a three-dimensional trailing-edge noise model that is
not only highly efficient but also capable of including non-frozen turbulence
effects.

should be used, error estimates are needed. In this paper we present quadrature
error estimates for layer potentials evaluated near surfaces of genus 0,
parametrized using a polar and an azimuthal angle, discretized by a combination
of the Gauss-Legendre and the trapezoidal quadrature rules. The error estimates
involve no unknown coefficients, but complex valued roots of a specified
distance function. The evaluation of the error estimates in general requires a
one dimensional local root-finding procedure, but for specific geometries we
obtain analytical results. Based on these explicit solutions, we derive
simplified error estimates for layer potentials evaluated near spheres; these
simple formulas depend only on the distance from the surface, the radius of the
sphere and the number of discretization points. The usefulness of these error
estimates is illustrated with numerical examples.

network models in numerous tasks, including classification, detection, and
segmentation. However, the high computational requirements of ViTs hinder their
widespread implementation. To address this issue, researchers have proposed
efficient hybrid transformer architectures that combine convolutional and
transformer layers and optimize attention computation for linear complexity.
Additionally, post-training quantization has been proposed as a means of
mitigating computational demands. Combining quantization techniques and
efficient hybrid transformer structures is crucial to maximize the acceleration
of vision transformers on mobile devices. However, no prior investigation has
applied quantization to efficient hybrid transformers. In this paper, at first,
we discover that the straightforward manner to apply the existing PTQ methods
for ViT to efficient hybrid transformers results in a drastic accuracy drop due
to the following challenges: (i) highly dynamic ranges, (ii) zero-point
overflow, (iii) diverse normalization, and (iv) limited model parameters (<5M).
To overcome these challenges, we propose a new post-training quantization
method, which is the first to quantize efficient hybrid vision transformers
(MobileViTv1 and MobileViTv2) with a significant margin (an average improvement
of 7.75%) compared to existing PTQ methods (EasyQuant, FQ-ViT, and PTQ4ViT). We

Variational Markov Decision Processes (VAE-MDPs) are discrete latent space
models that provide a reliable framework for distilling formally verifiable
controllers from any RL policy. While the related guarantees address relevant
practical aspects such as the satisfaction of performance and safety
properties, the VAE approach suffers from several learning flaws (posterior
collapse, slow learning speed, poor dynamics estimates), primarily due to the
absence of abstraction and representation guarantees to support latent
optimization. We introduce the Wasserstein auto-encoded MDP (WAE-MDP), a latent
space model that fixes those issues by minimizing a penalized form of the
optimal transport between the behaviors of the agent executing the original
policy and the distilled policy, for which the formal guarantees apply. Our
approach yields bisimulation guarantees while learning the distilled policy,
allowing concrete optimization of the abstraction and representation model
quality. Our experiments show that, besides distilling policies up to 10 times
faster, the latent model quality is indeed better in general. Moreover, we
present experiments from a simple time-to-failure verification algorithm on the
latent space. The fact that our approach enables such simple verification
techniques highlights its applicability.

excellent agreement with the observational findings. In the last part of this

demonstrate the practicality of 3DBiCar and RaBit, various applications are

and scattering exacerbates the condition of the inverse problem. Here, we
develop a scattering simulator that models low-contrast target signals buried
in heterogeneous strong background. We then train a deep neural network solely
on synthetic data to descatter and reconstruct a 3D volume from a single-shot
light-field measurement with low signal-to-background ratio (SBR). We apply
this network to our previously developed Computational Miniature Mesoscope and
demonstrate the robustness of our deep learning algorithm on a 75 micron thick
fixed mouse brain section and on bulk scattering phantoms with different
scattering conditions. The network can robustly reconstruct emitters in 3D with
a 2D measurement of SBR as low as 1.05 and as deep as a scattering length. We
analyze fundamental tradeoffs based on network design factors and
out-of-distribution data that affect the deep learning model's generalizability

them with the previous Suzaku and NuSTAR long-exposure observations, we studied
the long-term evolution of the orbital light curve in the soft X-ray band.
Although the observations by NICER and Suzaku are separated by $\sim$14 years,
i.e., more than 10^3 orbits, the orbital light curves show remarkable
consistency after calculating their running averages with a window width 70 ks.
Furthermore, all of the light curves show short-term variability with a time
scale of $\sim$10 ks. Since the column density did not vary when the flux
changed abruptly, such a short-term variability seems to be an intrinsic
feature of the X-ray emission. We propose that the short-term variability is
caused by clumps (or inhomogeneities) of the companion star wind impacting the
X-ray production site. The observed time scale matches well with the lifetime
of the clumps interacting with the pulsar wind and the dynamical time scale of
the relativistic intrabinary shock in the pulsar wind scenario.

to 78 giants, which represents the largest sample of P-rich stars to date.
Significant enhancements in O, Al, Si and Ce, as well as systematic
correlations among the elements, unveil the chemical fingerprint of the P-rich
stars. The high Mg and C+N found in some of the P-rich stars with respect to
P-normal stars is not confirmed over the full sample. Strikingly, the strong
over-abundance in the $\alpha$-element Si is accompanied by normal Ca and S
abundances. Our analysis of the orbital motion showed that the P-rich stars do
not belong to a specific sub-population. In addition, we confirm that the
majority of the sample stars are not part of binary systems.

oscillators of dissimilar initial frequencies in a ring at the changeover into
a synchronizing state. There are twenty four permutations upon assigning the
initial frequencies to the oscillators. The local interaction between the
adjacent coupled phase oscillators introduces details to the synchronization
features. Therefore, for the four unalike local coupled oscillators, we
classify all possible arrangements into three classes, where each class
contains eight configurations. The synchronized state appears at the
distinctive coupling when the oscillators transit to synchrony having
noticeable characteristics for each class. Also, the unison behaviour emerges
when a well-defined phase condition is developed. We utilize this conspicuous
phase condition to obtain a mathematical expression predicting the
distinguishing coupling for each class once the oscillators have a common
frequency. The obtained expression is given in terms of the initial
frequencies, at the minute the four local coupled phase oscillators attain the
same frequency. The analytic formula of the critical coupling allows us to
obtain expressions usable to determine the phase differences at the swop into a
synchronization stage.

double-wave potential chains, which can be described by a generalized
Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model, applied to a driven-dissipative exciton
polariton system. We show that in such potential chains, different types of
edge states can form. For resonant optical excitation, the nonlinearity
resulting from the repulsive polariton-polariton interaction leads to a
multistability of different edge states that are stabilized for the same set of
system and excitation parameters. This includes topologically protected edge
states evolved directly from the individual linear eigenmodes of the system as
well as additional edge states that originate from the localization of bulk
states in the presence of nonlinearity. Generally, the interplay of topological
localization and nonlinearity opens up exciting prospects for functional
topological structures.

of the robots undergo evolution and the brains of 'infant' robots are also
optimized by a learning process immediately after 'birth'. This paper is
concerned with the brain evolution mechanism in such a system. In particular,
we compare four options obtained by combining asexual or sexual brain
reproduction with Darwinian or Lamarckian evolution mechanisms. We conduct
experiments in simulation with a system of evolvable modular robots on two
different tasks. The results show that sexual reproduction of the robots'
brains is preferable in the Darwinian framework, but the effect is the opposite
in the Lamarckian system (both using the same infant learning method). Our
experiments suggest that the overall best option is asexual reproduction
combined with the Lamarckian framework, as it obtains better robots in terms of
fitness than the other three. Considering the evolved morphologies, the
different brain reproduction methods do not lead to differences. This result
indicates that the morphology of the robot is mainly determined by the task and
the environment, not by the brain reproduction methods.

no-retransmit philosophy for unreliable transmission of packets, yet maintains
cooperation with its reliable counterpart for arbitrary use of either
transmission mode. This can then address latency and reliability fluctuations
in a changing network environment, by smartly altering packet reliability. Our
evaluations are conducted using mininet to simulate real-world network

associated with star formation or jets from (super)massive black holes and, as
such, are more likely to be found in association with starburst galaxies or
early type galaxies. Recently, two new populations of radio sources have been
identified: (a) compact and persistent sources (PRS) associated with fast radio
bursts (FRB) in dwarf galaxies and (b) compact sources in dwarf galaxies that
could belong to the long-sought population of intermediate-mass black holes.
Despite the interesting aspects of these newly found sources, the current
sample size is small, limiting scrutiny of the underlying population. Here, we
present a search for compact radio sources coincident with dwarf galaxies. We
search the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey (LoTSS) -- the most sensitive
low-frequency (144 MHz central frequency) large-area survey for optically thin
synchrotron emission to date. Exploiting LoTSS' high spatial resolution (6
arcsec) and low astrometric uncertainty (about 0.2 arcsec), we match its
compact sources to the compiled sample of dwarf galaxies in the Census of the
Local Universe -- an H{\alpha} survey with the Palomar Observatory's 48-inch
Samuel Oschin Telescope. We identify 29 overluminous compact radio sources,
evaluate the probability of chance alignment within the sample, investigate the
potential nature of these sources, and evaluate their volumetric density. While
optical line-ratio diagnostics on the nebular lines from the host galaxies
prefer a star-formation origin (against an AGN origin), future high angular
resolution radio data is necessary to ascertain the origin of the radio
sources. We discuss planned strategies to differentiate them between candidate
FRB hosts and intermediate-mass black holes.

use is taken from a real-world problem for which a classical solution is
currently deployed and used in production. In this work, carried out in a
collaboration between the Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) and Reply, we
derive a QUBO formulation, which we solve using various methods: two D-Wave
hybrid solvers, that combine the employment of a quantum annealer together with
classical methods, and a purely classical algorithm. Particular focus is given
to the implementation of the constraint that requires the resulting portfolio's
variance to be below a specified threshold, whose representation in an Ising
model is not straightforward. We find satisfactory results, consistent with the
global optimum obtained by the exact classical strategy. However, since the
tuning of QUBO parameters is crucial for the optimization, we investigate a
hybrid method that allows for automatic tuning.

by maximizing the available torque reserve at all times. The constraints are
imposed by reformulating them as penalty terms to be added to the base running
cost of the control strategy, which is fuel consumption. Dynamic programming, a
popular optimal control technique, is then used to design the energy management
strategy that minimizes the total cost. A case study is developed for a p2

The impact of each driveability constraint is analyzed with respect to a set of
relevant features of the control strategy, such as the choice of engine
operating points and the gear shift pattern. The resulting discussion provides
some useful insight for the design of real-time, rule-based control strategies.

further enhance performance, we proposed a parity-check-aided dynamic
successive cancellation list flip (PC-DSCLF) decoder in this paper. First, we
designed a simplified flip metric, and proved by simulations that this
simplification hardly affects the error-correction performance of list flip

refers to an excellent ability to correct higher-order errors, which is
beneficial for error-correction performance improvement. Meantime, the
multi-PC-aided scheme to list flip decoders brings more flexible distributed
check bits, which can narrow down the range for searching error bits and
achieve a more efficient early termination. Simulation results showed that
without error-correction performance loss, PC-DSCLF decoder shows up to 51.1%
average complexity gain with respect to the state-of-the-art list flip decoder

revisit the expanded and shrunken honeycomb lattice structures proposed by Wu

atmosphere, and the oceans, as well as in astrophysics, and it is one of the
paradigmatic routes to turbulence in fluid mechanics. While in classical
hydrodynamics the instability is ruled by universal scaling laws, to what
extent universality emerges in quantum fluids is yet to be fully understood.
Here, we shed light on this matter by triggering the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability in atomic superfluids across widely different regimes, ranging from
weakly-interacting bosonic to strongly-correlated fermionic pair condensates.
Upon engineering two counter-rotating flows with tunable relative velocity, we
observe how their contact interface develops into an ordered circular array of
quantized vortices, which loses stability and rolls up into clusters in close
analogy with classical Kelvin-Helmholtz dynamics. We extract the instability
growth rates by tracking the position of individual vortices and find that they
follow universal scaling relations, predicted by both classical hydrodynamics
and a microscopic point-vortex model. Our results connect quantum and classical
fluids revealing how the motion of quantized vortices mirrors the interface
dynamics and open the way for exploring a wealth of out-of-equilibrium
phenomena, from vortex-matter phase transitions to the spontaneous emergence of
two-dimensional quantum turbulence .

trained by using both direct processing variables and indirect,
physics-informed variables to predict the FG yield. The indirect variables
include current-derived features (final current, maximum current, and charge
density) predicted from the proxy ML models and reaction temperatures simulated
from multi-physics modeling. With the combined indirect features, the final ML
model achieves an average R2 score of 0.81 +/- 0.05 and an average RMSE of

outliers in attributions or through inspection of latent concepts learned by

in a wave flume where single frequency waves are excited in a wide range of
frequencies. We explore various configurations of the device, measuring the
transmitted, reflected and dissipated energy of the waves. If the incoming wave
frequencies are sufficiently close to the natural frequency of the pendula, we
find a considerable wave attenuation effect, driven by viscous dissipative
mechanisms. This behaviour is enhanced by the number of resonators in the
array. Moreover, the device is also capable of reflecting the energy of
selected frequencies of the incoming waves. These frequencies can be predicted
by assuming the interactions involving at least three wave modes, including
higher harmonics, and are therefore associated with the distance between the
resonators. The presented results show promise for the development of a
environmentally sustainable device for mitigating waves in coastal zones.

inability to converge on the exact mechanism(s) governing cycle to cycle

sonographers, machines, and settings. To improve the generalizability on US
images across domains, we propose MI-SegNet, a novel mutual information (MI)
based framework to explicitly disentangle the anatomical and domain feature
representations; therefore, robust domain-independent segmentation can be
expected. Two encoders are employed to extract the relevant features for the
disentanglement. The segmentation only uses the anatomical feature map for its
prediction. In order to force the encoders to learn meaningful feature
representations a cross-reconstruction method is used during training.
Transformations, specific to either domain or anatomy are applied to guide the
encoders in their respective feature extraction task. Additionally, any MI
present in both feature maps is punished to further promote separate feature
spaces. We validate the generalizability of the proposed domain-independent
segmentation approach on several datasets with varying parameters and machines.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MI-SegNet serving
as a pre-trained model by comparing it with state-of-the-art networks.

performance or inefficiency because they underutilize the semantic relations

reliably and efficiently. Specifically, we design pharos code to represent the
semantics of the benign image, which preserves the similarity to semantically
relevant samples and dissimilarity to irrelevant ones. It is proven that we can
quickly calculate the pharos code via a simple math formula. Accordingly, PgA
can directly conduct a reliable and efficient attack on deep hashing-based
retrieval by maximizing the similarity between the hash code of the adversarial
example and the pharos code. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets
verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms the prior state-of-the-arts in

networks defined by a node percolation process corresponding to product
suppliers failing independently due to systemic shocks. We first show that the
size of the cascades follows a power law in random directed acyclic graphs,
whose topology encodes the natural ordering of products from simple raw
materials to complex products. This motivates the need for a supply chain
resilience metric, which we define as the maximum magnitude shock that the
production network can withstand such that at least $(1 -
\varepsilon)$-fraction of the products are produced with high probability as
the size of the production network grows to infinity. Next, we study the
resilience of many network architectures and classify them as resilient, where
large cascading failures can be avoided almost surely, and as fragile, where
large cascades are inevitable. In the next step, we give bounds on the expected
size of cascading failures in a given production network graph as the solution
to a linear program and show that extending the node percolation process to a
joint percolation process that affects the nodes and the links of the
production network becomes a special instance of the well-studied financial
contagion model of Eisenberg and Noe. We show that under certain assumptions,
the Katz centrality of each node can be used as a measure of their
vulnerability and give general lower bounds as well as optimal interventions
for improving resilience as a function of Katz centralities. Finally, to
validate our theoretical results, we empirically calculate the resilience
metric and study interventions in a variety of real-world networks.

for a possible correlation between the Compton dominance and the emission line
luminosity using the discrete correlation function (DCF) analysis. As a result,

value, while the emission line luminosity displays a moderate correlation with
the gamma-ray flux at a zero time lag. We also reveal that the optical
synchrotron continuum flux shows a pronounced correlation with the gamma-ray

maintaining the radio's specific signature; (iii) a Max-Rule module that

require relatively high-dimensional entity representations to preserve the

distillation) to compensate for the reduced dimension. However, such operations
produce degraded model accuracy and limited reduction of model parameters.
Specifically, we view the concatenation of all entity representations as an

entity representations equal to enlarging the width of the embedding layer to
gain expressiveness. To achieve parameter efficiency without sacrificing
accuracy, we instead increase the depth and propose a deeper embedding network

In this paper, we empirically examine the relative contribution to the success

the performance of the dialogue policy is positively correlated with the

dual-granularity Q-function that explores the most promising response category
to intervene in the sampling process. Our approach extracts actions based on a

Additionally, we use offline RL and learn from multiple reward functions

small set of data is randomly sampled each time for the neural network
training, which is accessed by batch through yield method. The training part of

Physics-informed PointNet (PIPN) is primarily designed to fill this gap between
PINNs (as weakly supervised learning models) and fully supervised learning

desired partial differential equations over a few hundred domains
simultaneously, while it only uses sparse labeled data. This framework benefits
fast geometric designs in the industry when only sparse labeled data are
available. Particularly, we show that PIPN predicts the solution of a plane
stress problem over more than 500 domains with different geometries,
simultaneously. Moreover, we pioneer implementing the concept of remarkable
batch size (i.e., the number of geometries fed into PIPN at each sub-epoch)
into PIPN. Specifically, we try batch sizes of 7, 14, 19, 38, 76, and 133.
Additionally, the effect of the PIPN size, symmetric function in the PIPN

applications. However, the high computational complexity and storage cost makes
deep learning hard to be used on resource-constrained devices, and it is not
environmental-friendly with much power cost. In this paper, we focus on
low-rank optimization for efficient deep learning techniques. In the space
domain, deep neural networks are compressed by low rank approximation of the
network parameters, which directly reduces the storage requirement with a
smaller number of network parameters. In the time domain, the network
parameters can be trained in a few subspaces, which enables efficient training
for fast convergence. The model compression in the spatial domain is summarized
into three categories as pre-train, pre-set, and compression-aware methods,
respectively. With a series of integrable techniques discussed, such as sparse
pruning, quantization, and entropy coding, we can ensemble them in an
integration framework with lower computational complexity and storage. Besides
of summary of recent technical advances, we have two findings for motivating
future works: one is that the effective rank outperforms other sparse measures
for network compression. The other is a spatial and temporal balance for
tensorized neural networks.

challenges of modern science. In this work, we investigate dark energy on
astrophysical scales and provide a cosmology-independent method to measure its
equation-of-state parameter $w$. First we introduce the concept of a perfect
fluid in any static, curved spacetime and reexpress the energy-momentum tensor
of the fluid in a general isotropic form, by which the equation-of-state
parameter can be defined in a physical and global way. Within this theoretical
framework, the energy-momentum tensor of dark energy on different scales can
take the general isotropic form. In addition, we explore the SdS$_{w}$
spacetime and establish its connection with dark energy in cosmology through
the equation-of-state parameter $w$. Locally a repulsive dark force can be
induced by dark energy in the SdS$_{w}$ spacetime. Then we apply the concept of
the dark force to realistic astrophysical systems via the Poisson equation.
Finally, we find that an anomaly in the Milky Way rotation curve can be
interpreted by the dark force, and by fitting the galactic curve, we
model-independently obtain the value of the equation-of-state parameter of dark
energy.

obstruction. Recent improvements in data availability, as well as widespread
use of GPS tracking now make it possible to explore these variables in a

shown to be highly significant, and this is supported by a lower

learning, distributed computing, and big data technologies, resulting in new
research directions of EC like distributed EC and surrogate-assisted EC. These
advances have significantly improved the performance and the application scope
of EC, but also trigger privacy leakages, such as the leakage of optimal
results and surrogate model. Accordingly, evolutionary computation combined
with privacy protection is becoming an emerging topic. However, privacy
concerns in evolutionary computation lack a systematic exploration, especially
for the object, motivation, position, and method of privacy protection. To this
end, in this paper, we discuss three typical optimization paradigms (i.e.,
\textit{centralized optimization, distributed optimization, and data-driven
optimization}) to characterize optimization modes of evolutionary computation
and propose BOOM to sort out privacy concerns in evolutionary computation.
Specifically, the centralized optimization paradigm allows clients to outsource
optimization problems to the centralized server and obtain optimization
solutions from the server. While the distributed optimization paradigm exploits
the storage and computational power of distributed devices to solve
optimization problems. Also, the data-driven optimization paradigm utilizes
data collected in history to tackle optimization problems lacking explicit
objective functions. Particularly, this paper adopts BOOM to characterize the
object and motivation of privacy protection in three typical optimization
paradigms and discusses potential privacy-preserving technologies balancing
optimization performance and privacy guarantees in three typical optimization
paradigms. Furthermore, this paper attempts to foresee some new research
directions of privacy-preserving evolutionary computation.

provide a path to understanding naturalistic behavior. We can take a
comparative cognitive modeling perspective to understand the limits of this
performance and the existence of superperformance. We will discuss two
categories that are hypothesized to originate in terms of coevolutionary
relationships and evolutionary trade offs: supersamplers and superplanners.
Supersamplers take snapshots of their sensory world at a very high sampling
rate. Examples include flies (vision) and frogs (audition) with ecological
specializations. Superplanners internally store information to evaluate and act
upon multiple features of spatiotemporal environments. Slow lorises and turtles
provide examples of superplanning capabilities. The Gibsonian Information (GI)
paradigm is used to evaluate sensory sampling and planning with respect to
direct perception and its role in capturing environmental information content.
By contrast, superplanners utilize internal models of the environment to
compensate for normal rates of sensory sampling, and this relationship often
exists as a sampling/planning tradeoff. Supersamplers and superplanners can
exist in adversarial relationships, or longer-term as coevolutionary
relationships. Moreover, the tradeoff between sampling and planning capacity
can break down, providing relativistic regimes. We can apply the principles of
superperformance to human augmentation technologies.

the de-facto SAT solver benchmark for BDDs, demonstrating a significant speedup
of 18.73x over our non-parallel baselines, and a remarkable performance boost
w.r.t. other state-of-the-art BDDs packages.

  spaces","16 pages",,,,"math.GN","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Some fixed point results of classical theory, such as Banach's Fixed Point
Theorem, have been previously extended by other authors to asymmetric spaces in
recent years. The aim of this paper is to extend to asymmetric spaces some
others fixed point results for contractions, shrinkage maps and non-expansive
maps. In fact, a version of Edelstein type theorem (Theorem 21), Schauder type
theorem (Theorem 22), and Kirk type theorem (Theorem 26) are stated and proved
in this new context. In order to do that, classical definitions and results
were adapted to this new context. Also, the normal structure in the asymmetric
case was considered.

emitted wavefield has garnered significant attention in recent years. However,
achieving such maximum chirality is challenging, as it typically requires
complex chiral metamaterials. Here we demonstrate that chiral spheres can yield
maximum chirality in their emitted wavefield. Specifically, we analytically
find the spectral trajectories at which chiral spheres become optically
transparent to a given helicity of the incident field, while for its opposite
helicity, they behave as dual objects, i.e., on scattering, they preserve
helicity. Since chiral spheres behave as dual objects at the first Kerker
condition of zero backscattering, we significantly simplify this condition in
terms of a Riccati-Bessel function. Importantly, all our results are exact and
applicable regardless of the multipolar order, refractive index contrast,
optical size, and intrinsic chirality of the chiral sphere. Thus, our exact
findings can serve as building blocks for designing novel metasurfaces or
metamaterials with maximum electromagnetic chirality properties.

  adaptation with neural networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding generalization is crucial to confidently engineer and deploy
machine learning models, especially when deployment implies a shift in the data
domain. For such domain adaptation problems, we seek generalization bounds
which are tractably computable and tight. If these desiderata can be reached,
the bounds can serve as guarantees for adequate performance in deployment.
However, in applications where deep neural networks are the models of choice,
deriving results which fulfill these remains an unresolved challenge; most
existing bounds are either vacuous or has non-estimable terms, even in
favorable conditions. In this work, we evaluate existing bounds from the
literature with potential to satisfy our desiderata on domain adaptation image
classification tasks, where deep neural networks are preferred. We find that
all bounds are vacuous and that sample generalization terms account for much of
the observed looseness, especially when these terms interact with measures of
domain shift. To overcome this and arrive at the tightest possible results, we
combine each bound with recent data-dependent PAC-Bayes analysis, greatly
improving the guarantees. We find that, when domain overlap can be assumed, a
simple importance weighting extension of previous work provides the tightest
estimable bound. Finally, we study which terms dominate the bounds and identify
possible directions for further improvement.

the future, increasingly anthropomorphic AI systems may form ongoing

investigates the uncertain future of persuasive AI systems. We examine ways
that AI could qualitatively alter our relationship to and views regarding
persuasion by shifting the balance of persuasive power, allowing personalized
persuasion to be deployed at scale, powering misinformation campaigns, and
changing the way humans can shape their own discourse. We consider ways
AI-driven persuasion could differ from human-driven persuasion. We warn that

implicit user feedback data and may be subject to biases when users are
systematically under/over-exposed to certain items. Unbiased learning based on
inverse propensity scores (IPS), which estimate the probability of observing a
user-item pair given the historical information, has been proposed to address
the issue. In these methods, propensity score estimation is usually limited to
the view of item, that is, treating the feedback data as sequences of items
that interacted with the users. However, the feedback data can also be treated
from the view of user, as the sequences of users that interact with the items.
Moreover, the two views can jointly enhance the propensity score estimation.
Inspired by the observation, we propose to estimate the propensity scores from
the views of user and item, called Dually Enhanced Propensity Score Estimation
(DEPS). Specifically, given a target user-item pair and the corresponding item
and user interaction sequences, DEPS firstly constructs a time-aware causal
graph to represent the user-item observational probability. According to the
graph, two complementary propensity scores are estimated from the views of item
and user, respectively, based on the same set of user feedback data. Finally,
two transformers are designed to make the final preference prediction.
Theoretical analysis showed the unbiasedness and variance of DEPS. Experimental
results on three publicly available and an industrial datasets demonstrated
that DEPS can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines.

to differences between methods, enabling direct comparison between systems. The
dataset was based on 18 hours of full-body motion capture, including fingers,
of different persons engaging in a dyadic conversation. Ten teams participated
in the challenge across two tiers: full-body and upper-body gesticulation. For
each tier, we evaluated both the human-likeness of the gesture motion and its
appropriateness for the specific speech signal. Our evaluations decouple
human-likeness from gesture appropriateness, which has been a difficult problem

  The evaluation results are a revolution, and a revelation. Some synthetic
conditions are rated as significantly more human-like than human motion
capture. To the best of our knowledge, this has never been shown before on a
high-fidelity avatar. On the other hand, all synthetic motion is found to be
vastly less appropriate for the speech than the original motion-capture

completely novel form of nonclassicality in the sense that the nonlocality of
such correlations can be demonstrated in fixed local input scenarios. Before
the pioneering work by M.O.Renou, et al., in [1], the nonlocal feature of such
network correlations was directly attributable to standard Bell nonlocality. In
[1], the authors provided some of the first examples of triangle network
correlations, whose nonlocality cannot be deduced from Bell-CHSH nonlocality.
To date, a complete characterization of such scenarios is yet to be provided.
Present work characterizes correlations arising due to fixed local measurements
in a triangle network under a source independence assumptions. Precisely
speaking, a set of criteria is framed in the form of Bell-type inequalities,
each of which is necessarily satisfied by trilocal correlations. Possible
quantum violation of at least one criterion from the set is analyzed, which in
turn points out the utility of the set of criteria to detect nonlocality
(nontrilocality) in quantum triangle networks. Interestingly, measurement on a
local product state basis turns out to be sufficient to generate nontrilocal
correlations in some quantum networks. Noise tolerance of the detection
criteria is discussed followed by a generalization of the framework for
demonstrating correlations in any n-sided polygon where n is finite.

challenge is the computation of advective fluxes across material interfaces
that separate drastically different thermodynamic states and relations. A
popular idea in this regard is to locally construct bimaterial Riemann
problems, and to apply their exact solutions in flux computation. For general
equations of state, however, finding the exact solution of a Riemann problem is
expensive as it requires nested loops. Multiplied by the large number of
Riemann problems constructed during a simulation, the computational cost often
becomes prohibitive. The work presented in this paper aims to accelerate the
solution of bimaterial Riemann problems without introducing approximations or
offline precomputation tasks. The basic idea is to exploit some special
properties of the Riemann problem equations, and to recycle previous solutions
as much as possible. Following this idea, four acceleration methods are
developed, including (1) a change of integration variable through rarefaction
fans, (2) storing and reusing integration trajectory data, (3) step size
adaptation, and (4) constructing an R-tree on the fly to generate initial
guesses. The performance of these acceleration methods are assessed using four
example problems in underwater explosion, laser-induced cavitation, and
hypervelocity impact. These problems exhibit strong shock waves, large
interface deformation, contact of multiple (>2) interfaces, and interaction
between gases and condensed matters. In these challenging cases, the solution
of bimaterial Riemann problems is accelerated by 37 to 83 times. As a result,
the total cost of advective flux computation, which includes the exact Riemann
problem solution at material interfaces and the numerical flux calculation over
the entire computational domain, is accelerated by 18 to 79 times.

the occurrence of anomalous phytoplankton data is rare. Thus, we propose an
unsupervised anomaly detection system based on the similarity of the original
and autoencoder-reconstructed samples. With this approach, we were able to
reach an overall F1 score of 0.75 in nine phytoplankton species, which could be
further improved by species-specific fine-tuning. The proposed unsupervised

detect also unknown anomalies and it does not require any annotated anomalous

this small object detection where the crowded small object regions are

accomplished by adding other learnable components, thus complicating the
training and inference over a standard detection process. In this paper, we
propose an efficient Cascaded Zoom-in (CZ) detector that re-purposes the
detector itself for density-guided training and inference. During training,
density crops are located, labeled as a new class, and employed to augment the
training dataset. During inference, the density crops are first detected along
with the base class objects, and then input for a second stage of inference.
This approach is easily integrated into any detector, and creates no
significant change in the standard detection process, like the uniform cropping
approach popular in aerial image detection. Experimental results on the aerial
images of the challenging VisDrone and DOTA datasets verify the benefits of the

step itself is using a small fraction of the overall Roman 2nd moment error

to anechoic chambers (ACs) to perform radar cross-section (RCS) pattern

pointing towards a target under test placed on a rotating mast. As a classical
RCS characterization, the echo signal is analysed based on two measurements
with and without the target in the RC. In the hypothesis of an ideal diffuse
field generated in the RC, this signal difference appears as the echo signal
hidden in a Gaussian noise. In case of a point-like backscattering target,
observing this signal over a given frequency bandwidth allows the
identification of the target response as a sinusoidal signal over this
bandwidth whose period is related to the antenna-target distance measured from
the measurement calibration plane positions. Therefore, the extraction of the
magnitude of this sinusoidal signal requires a proper estimation of this
distance. Furthermore, a sinusoidal regression processing relies on the
approximation of a constant envelope over the selected frequency bandwidth,
imposing some restrictions. In this paper, we introduce a two-step method that
consists in identifying the most appropriate distance according to the target's
orientation before estimating the magnitude of the sinusoidal signal. We
highlight improvement of RCS estimation on a point-like back-scattering target

individual components: dark matter, gas, and galaxies, all distributed within
spherical haloes with a range of masses. The halo properties are specified
through a series of simulation-calibrated ingredients including the halo mass
function, non-linear halo bias and a dark matter density profile that can
additionally account for the impact of baryon feedback. By incorporating a
model of the galaxy halo occupation distribution, the properties of central and
satellite galaxies, their non-linear bias and intrinsic alignment can be
predicted. Through analytical calculations of spherical collapse in exotic

nitrogen doped lutetium hydride (LuH$_{2\pm\text{x}}$N$_y$) with a dark-bluish
color and a structure with the space group of $Fm\bar{3}m$ evidenced by x-ray
diffraction. This structure is the same as that reported in ref. 1. The energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the existence of nitrogen in some
areas of the samples. At ambient pressure, we witness a kink of resistivity and
magnetization at about 300 K, which may correspond to a rearrangement of
hydrogen/nitrogen atoms, namely a structural transition. However, by applying a
pressure from 1 GPa to 6 GPa, we have seen a progressively optimized metallic
behavior without showing superconductivity down to 10 K. Temperature dependence
of magnetization shows a roughly flat feature between 100 and 320 K, and the
magnetization increases with magnetic field at 100 K, all these are not
expected for superconductivity at 100 K. Thus, we conclude the absence of
near-ambient superconductivity in this nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride under
pressures below 6 GPa.

measurements of the a.c. elastocaloric effect and generic symmetry arguments,
we identify an \textit{elastic level splitting} that is uniquely associated

we identify to be the first excited state at $\Delta/k_\text B\approx1.6\,\rm

  Using a Single Sketch",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we investigate the problem of sketch-based object localization
on natural images, where given a crude hand-drawn sketch of an object, the goal
is to localize all the instances of the same object on the target image. This
problem proves difficult due to the abstract nature of hand-drawn sketches,
variations in the style and quality of sketches, and the large domain gap
existing between the sketches and the natural images. To mitigate these
challenges, existing works proposed attention-based frameworks to incorporate
query information into the image features. However, in these works, the query
features are incorporated after the image features have already been
independently learned, leading to inadequate alignment. In contrast, we propose
a sketch-guided vision transformer encoder that uses cross-attention after each
block of the transformer-based image encoder to learn query-conditioned image
features leading to stronger alignment with the query sketch. Further, at the
output of the decoder, the object and the sketch features are refined to bring
the representation of relevant objects closer to the sketch query and thereby
improve the localization. The proposed model also generalizes to the object
categories not seen during training, as the target image features learned by
our method are query-aware. Our localization framework can also utilize
multiple sketch queries via a trainable novel sketch fusion strategy. The model
is evaluated on the images from the public object detection benchmark, namely
MS-COCO, using the sketch queries from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets.
Compared with existing localization methods, the proposed approach gives a
$6.6\%$ and $8.0\%$ improvement in mAP for seen objects using sketch queries
from QuickDraw! and Sketchy datasets, respectively, and a $12.2\%$ improvement
in AP@50 for large objects that are `unseen' during training.

and stratification are common features. Here we investigate the evolution of a
stratified turbulent cloud under rotation. Since the turbulent cloud consists
of vortices with different shapes and sizes, a single eddy under rotation and
stratification is considered first. The stratified eddy is different from an
eddy under pure rotation in two respects. First, a new potential vorticity (PV)
mode is found, which is manifested as a static stable vortex. Second, inertial
waves found in the purely rotating case are replaced by inertial-gravity waves
in the stratified case. We then investigate a turbulent cloud for which we
perform numerical simulations at a fixed Rossby number and for various Froude
numbers. Unlike the purely rotating case where vertical columnar structures
spontaneously grow out of the turbulent cloud, in the stratified case the
columnar structures emerge and tilt away from the vertical direction. As the
stratification gets stronger, the tilting angle increases and the rate of cloud
expansion decreases. The columnar structures are composed of inertial-gravity
waves, as both the tilting angles of the flow structures and vertical growth
rates of the turbulent cloud can be predicted by the linear theory. We adopt
Lagrangian particle tracking to identify regions dominated by wave and
turbulence. When the stratification is weak, the inertial-gravity waves carry a
considerable portion of energy away from the turbulent cloud. This portion of
energy reduces as the stratification becomes stronger.

assumptions regarding the Galactic dust distribution and extragalactic stellar
populations. Recent estimates utilizing synoptic near-infrared surveys have
begun to provide a glimpse of a consensus ($\approx25-50$ yr$^{-1}$); however,
a consistent estimate remains lacking. Here, we present the first all-sky

is negligible, the 6-month cadence NEOWISE dataset offers unique sensitivity to
discover slowly evolving novae across the entire Galaxy. Using a novel image
subtraction pipeline together with systematic selection criteria, we identify a
sample of 49 rapidly evolving MIR outbursts as candidate Galactic novae. While
27 of these sources are known novae, the remaining are previously missed nova
candidates discovered in this work. The unknown events are spatially clustered
along the densest and most heavily obscured regions of the Galaxy where
previous novae are severely underrepresented. We use simulations of the NEOWISE
survey strategy, the pipeline detection efficiency, and our criteria to derive
a Galactic nova rate of $47.9^{+3.1}_{-8.3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The discovery of these
exceptionally bright (yet overlooked) nova candidates confirm emerging
suggestions that optical surveys have been highly incomplete in searches for
Galactic novae, highlighting the potential for MIR searches in revealing the

for this spectral sequence is the derived functors of sequential limit in the
category of graded comodules over the dual Steenrod algebra. Since then, there
has not been an identification of those derived functors in more familiar or
computable terms. Consequently there have been no calculations using Sadofsky's
spectral sequence except in cases where these derived functors are trivial in
positive cohomological degrees.
  In this paper, we prove that the input for the Sadofsky spectral sequence is
simply the local cohomology of the Steenrod algebra, taken with appropriate
(quite computable) coefficients. This turns out to require both some formal
results, like some general results on torsion theories and local cohomology of
noncommutative non-Noetherian rings, and some decidedly non-formal results,
like a 1985 theorem of Steve Mitchell on some very specific duality properties
of the Steenrod algebra not shared by most finite-type Hopf algebras. Along the

methods is introduced. These models extend the framework proposed in Albergo &
Vanden-Eijnden (2023), enabling the use of a broad class of continuous-time
stochastic processes called `stochastic interpolants' to bridge any two
arbitrary probability density functions exactly in finite time. These
interpolants are built by combining data from the two prescribed densities with
an additional latent variable that shapes the bridge in a flexible way. The
time-dependent probability density function of the stochastic interpolant is
shown to satisfy a first-order transport equation as well as a family of
forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diffusion. Upon
consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint
immediately leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based
on probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations with an
adjustable level of noise. The drift coefficients entering these models are
time-dependent velocity fields characterized as the unique minimizers of simple
quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score of
the interpolant density. Remarkably, we show that minimization of these
quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for any of our
generative models built upon stochastic dynamics. By contrast, we establish
that generative models based upon a deterministic dynamics must, in addition,
control the Fisher divergence between the target and the model. We also
construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross-entropy of
interpolant-based generative models, discuss connections with other stochastic
bridges, and demonstrate that such models recover the Schr\""odinger bridge
between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the
interpolant.

function. This wave function is a function not only of the matter fields, but
also of spacetime. The no-boundary proposal is the idea that the wave function
should be calculated by summing over geometries that have no boundary to the
past, and over regular matter configurations on these geometries. Accordingly,
the universe is finite, self-contained and the big bang singularity is avoided.
Moreover, given a dynamical theory, the no-boundary proposal provides
probabilities for various solutions of the theory. In this sense it provides a
quantum theory of initial conditions.
  This review starts with a general overview of the framework of quantum
cosmology, describing both the canonical and path integral approaches, and
their interpretations. After recalling several heuristic motivations for the
no-boundary proposal, its consequences are illustrated with simple examples,
mainly in the context of cosmic inflation. We review how to include
perturbations, assess the classicality of spacetime and how probabilities may
be derived. A special emphasis is given to explicit implementations in
minisuperspace, to observational consequences, and to the relationship of the
no-boundary wave function with string theory. At each stage, the required
analytic and numerical techniques are explained in detail, including the

explain a text classifier's decision. After formalizing its algorithm and
providing useful insights, we demonstrate mathematically that Anchors produces
meaningful results when used with linear text classifiers on top of a TF-IDF

unsupervised parser on continuous word-level speech representations. This is
done by first splitting utterances into sequences of word-level segments, and
aggregating self-supervised speech representations within segments to obtain
segment embeddings. We find that separately training a parser on the unpaired

results for unsupervised parsing. Additionally, our results suggest that
accurate segmentation alone may be sufficient to parse spoken sentences
accurately. Finally, we show the direct approach may learn head-directionality
correctly for both head-initial and head-final languages without any explicit

tool to capture long-range dependency. However, such power comes at a cost: it
incurs a huge computation burden and heavy memory footprint as pairwise token
interaction across all spatial locations is computed. A series of works attempt
to alleviate this problem by introducing handcrafted and content-agnostic
sparsity into attention, such as restricting the attention operation to be
inside local windows, axial stripes, or dilated windows. In contrast to these
approaches, we propose a novel dynamic sparse attention via bi-level routing to
enable a more flexible allocation of computations with content awareness.
Specifically, for a query, irrelevant key-value pairs are first filtered out at
a coarse region level, and then fine-grained token-to-token attention is
applied in the union of remaining candidate regions (\ie, routed regions). We
provide a simple yet effective implementation of the proposed bi-level routing
attention, which utilizes the sparsity to save both computation and memory
while involving only GPU-friendly dense matrix multiplications. Built with the
proposed bi-level routing attention, a new general vision transformer, named
BiFormer, is then presented. As BiFormer attends to a small subset of relevant
tokens in a \textbf{query adaptive} manner without distraction from other
irrelevant ones, it enjoys both good performance and high computational
efficiency, especially in dense prediction tasks. Empirical results across
several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection,
and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our design. Code is

to model the lane graph in a novel path-wise manner, which well preserves the

Surprisingly, the Borda regret minimization problem turns out to be difficult,

$\tilde{O}( (d \log K)^{1/3} T^{2/3})$ with proper choices of hyperparameters.

varies strongly with both stellar mass and age. For Sun-like stars (5800 K),
the statistical age uncertainties improve monotonically from $\pm$38% at 0.2
Gyr to $\pm12$% at 2 Gyr, and are caused by the empirical scatter of the
cluster rotation sequences combined with the rate of stellar spin-down. For
low-mass K-dwarfs (4200 K), the posteriors are highly asymmetric due to stalled
spin-down, and $\pm$1$\sigma$ age uncertainties vary non-monotonically between
10% and 50% over the first few gigayears. High-mass K-dwarfs (5000 K) older

The survey was carried out with VISTA, using VIRCAM, and collected data in the
near-infrared passbands J, H, and Ks. With a total on-sky exposure time of 49.4
h VISIONS covers an area of 650 deg$^2$, and it was designed to build an
infrared legacy archive similar to that of 2MASS. Taking place between April
2017 and March 2022, the observations yielded approximately 1.15 million
images, which comprise 19 TB of raw data. The observations are grouped into
three different subsurveys: The wide subsurvey comprises shallow, large-scale
observations and has visited the star-forming complexes six times over the
course of its execution. The deep subsurvey of dedicated high-sensitivity
observations has collected data on the areas with the largest amounts of dust
extinction. The control subsurvey includes observations of areas of
low-to-negligible dust extinction. Using this strategy, the VISIONS survey
offers multi-epoch position measurements, is able to access deeply embedded
objects, and provides a baseline for statistical comparisons and sample
completeness. In particular, VISIONS is designed to measure the proper motions
of point sources with a precision of 1 mas/yr or better, when complemented with
data from VHS. Hence, VISIONS can provide proper motions for sources
inaccessible to Gaia. VISIONS will enable addressing a range of topics,
including the 3D distribution and motion of embedded stars and the nearby
interstellar medium, the identification and characterization of young stellar
objects, the formation and evolution of embedded stellar clusters and their
initial mass function, as well as the characteristics of interstellar dust and
the reddening law.

perpendicular to the larger lobes, but also coinciding with the inner X-ray

a powerlaw, while ruling out a significant contribution from accretion. The
radio lightcurve over 3 decades shows a change about 10 years ago, which might
be related to ongoing feedback in the core. The southern BCG in the NGC6338

with zero (or small) multi-particle input end up close to saturating the
S-matrix bounds derived by other methods. There is a version of the iterative
algorithm that is directly related to Feynman diagrams: it effectively re-sums
infinitely many two-particle reducible planar Feynman graphs in the $\phi^4$

alternative to Cold Dark Matter. Numerical simulations solving the
Schr\""odinger-Poisson (SP) equation, which governs FDM dynamics, show that FDM
halos consist of a central solitonic core (representing the ground state of the
SP equation), surrounded by a large envelope of excited states. Wave
interference gives rise to order unity density fluctuations throughout the
envelope and causes the soliton to undergo density oscillations and execute a
confined random walk in the central region of the halo. The resulting
gravitational potential perturbations are an efficient source of dynamical
heating. Using high-resolution numerical simulations of a $6.6 \times 10^{9}
\rm M_{\odot}$ FDM halo with boson mass, $m_{\rm b}=8 \times 10^{-23} \ \rm
eV$, we investigate the impact of this dynamical heating on the structure and
kinematics of spheroidal dwarf galaxies of a fixed mass but different initial
sizes and ellipticities. The galaxies are set up in equilibrium in the
time-and-azimuthally averaged halo potential and evolved for $10 \ \rm Gyr$ in
the live FDM halo. We find that they continuously increase their sizes and
central velocity dispersions. In addition, their kinematic structures become
strongly radially anisotropic, especially in the outskirts. Dynamical heating
also causes initially ellipsoidal galaxies to become more spherical over time
from the inside out and gives rise to distorted, non-concentric isodensity

stability of chirally symmetric vacua is sensitive to the interplay between
non-perturbative dynamics and deformations necessary to generate chirality

recent or ongoing tidal interaction are present in 45-64% of the hosts,
including double nuclei, tidal tails, bridges, plumes, shells, and extended
debris. Ongoing interaction with a companion is apparent in 27-41% of the

projected nuclear separations <10 kpc. Detailed surface brightness modeling
indicates that 41% of the hosts are bulge-dominated while only 18% are disks.

found that Bayesian deep neural networks using the Variational Density

best performing attribution method, the Vanilla Gradient. However, in general,
various types of robust neural networks may not be more explainable, despite
these models producing more visually plausible attribution maps.

tackle climate change. However, significant environmental and health-risk
concerns remain associated with potential accidents. Despite significant
preventive efforts, we must acknowledge that accidents may happen and,
therefore, develop strategies and technologies for mitigating their
consequences. In this paper, we review the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power
Plant accident, synthesize the time series and accident progressions across
relevant disciplines, including in-plant physics and engineering systems,
operators' actions, emergency responses, meteorology, radionuclide release and
transport, land contamination, and health impacts. In light of the latest
observations and simulation studies, we identify three key factors that
exacerbated the consequences of the accident: (1) the failure of Unit 2
containment venting, (2) the insufficient integration of radiation measurements
and meteorology data in the evacuation strategy, and (3) the limited risk
assessment and emergency preparedness. We propose new research and development
directions to improve the resilience of nuclear power plants, including (1)
meteorology-informed proactive venting, (2) machine learning-enabled adaptive
evacuation zones, and (3) comprehensive risk-informed emergency planning while
leveraging the experience from responses to other disasters.

signatures on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in particular, pairwise
hotspots (PHS). In this work, we show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
provide a powerful tool for identifying PHS on the CMB. While for a given
hotspot profile a traditional Matched Filter Analysis is known to be optimal, a
Neural Network learns to effectively detect the large variety of shapes that
can arise in realistic models of particle production. Considering an idealized
situation where the dominant background to the PHS signal comes from the
standard CMB fluctuations, we show that a CNN can isolate the PHS with
$\mathcal{O}(10)\%$ efficiency even if the hotspot temperature is
$\mathcal{O}(10)$ times smaller than the average CMB fluctuations. Overall, the
CNN search is sensitive to heavy particle masses $M_0/H_I=\mathcal{O}(200)$,
and constitutes one of the unique probes of very high energy particle physics.

  Our solution includes a set of novel language constructs, compiler
transformations, and runtime support. We propose a producer-consumer pattern to
flexibly define multiple, different variants of OpenMP code regions to enable
adaptation. Those regions are transparently profiled at runtime to autonomously
learn optimizing machine learning models that dynamically select the fastest
variant. Our approach significantly reduces users' efforts of programming
adaptive applications on heterogeneous architectures by leveraging machine
learning techniques and code generation capabilities of OpenMP compilation.
Using a complete reference implementation in Clang/LLVM we evaluate three

would contradict the microlens parallax measurement derived from Spitzer

lens-source relative proper-motion measurements. By contrast, Gould (2022)
estimated a probability $p=10\%$ that the ``other star'' resolved by
single-epoch late-time AO would be a companion to the host or the microlensed
source, which is much more probable than a 4$\,\sigma$ statistical fluctuation.
In addition, independent of this proper-motion discrepancy, the kinematics of
this host-identification are substantially less probable than those of the
Spitzer solution. Hence, this identification should not be accepted, pending
additional observations that would either confirm or contradict it, which could
be taken in 2023. Motivated by this tension, we present two additional
investigations. We explore the possibility that Vandorou et al. (2023)
identified the wrong ``star'' (or stellar asterism) on which to conduct their
analysis. We find that astrometry of KMT and Keck images favors a star (or
asterism) lying about 175 mas northwest of the one that they chose. We also
present event parameters from a combined fit to all survey data, which yields,
in particular, a more precise mass ratio, $q=(4.6\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-5}$.
Finally, we discuss the broader implications of minimizing such false positives

possible when AO on next-generation telescopes are applied to microlensing

accommodate four components: representations, operations, structures and
encoding. It further requires a principled account of how these components
mechanistically, and causally, relate to each another. While previous models
have isolated regions of interest for structure-building and lexical access,
many gaps remain with respect to bridging distinct scales of neural complexity.
By expanding existing accounts of how neural oscillations can index various
linguistic processes, this article proposes a neurocomputational architecture
for syntax, termed the ROSE model (Representation, Operation, Structure,
Encoding). Under ROSE, the basic data structures of syntax are atomic features,
types of mental representations (R), and are coded at the single-unit and
ensemble level. Elementary computations (O) that transform these units into
manipulable objects accessible to subsequent structure-building levels are
coded via high frequency gamma activity. Low frequency synchronization and
cross-frequency coupling code for recursive categorial inferences (S). Distinct
forms of low frequency coupling and phase-amplitude coupling (delta-theta
coupling via pSTS-IFG; theta-gamma coupling via IFG to conceptual hubs) then
encode these structures onto distinct workspaces (E). Causally connecting R to
O is spike-phase/LFP coupling; connecting O to S is phase-amplitude coupling;
connecting S to E is a system of frontotemporal traveling oscillations;
connecting E to lower levels is low-frequency phase resetting of spike-LFP
coupling. ROSE is reliant on neurophysiologically plausible mechanisms, is
supported at all four levels by a range of recent empirical research, and
provides an anatomically precise and falsifiable grounding for the basic
property of natural language syntax: hierarchical, recursive
structure-building.

metrology. Classically optimizing circuits with PNR detectors is challenging
due to their exponentially large Hilbert space, and quadratically more
challenging in the presence of decoherence as state vectors are replaced by
density matrices. To tackle this problem, we introduce a family of algorithms
that calculate detection probabilities, conditional states (as well as their
gradients with respect to circuit parametrizations) with a complexity that is
comparable to the noiseless case. As a consequence we can simulate and optimize
circuits with twice the number of modes as we could before, using the same
resources. More precisely, for an $M$-mode noisy circuit with detected modes
$D$ and undetected modes $U$, the complexity of our algorithm is $O(M^2
\prod_{i\in U} C_i^2 \prod_{i\in D} C_i)$, rather than $O(M^2 \prod_{i \in
D\cup U} C_i^2)$, where $C_i$ is the Fock cutoff of mode $i$. As a particular
case, our approach offers a full quadratic speedup for calculating detection
probabilities, as in that case all modes are detected. Finally, these
algorithms are implemented and ready to use in the open-source photonic

stochastic semantic segmentation methods must learn to predict conditional

Social media users are known to reply to misinformation posts with
counter-misinformation messages, which have been shown to be effective in
curbing the spread of misinformation. This is called social correction.
However, the characteristics of tweets that attract social correction versus
those that do not remain unknown. To close the gap, we focus on answering the
following two research questions: (1) ``Given a tweet, will it be countered by
other users?'', and (2) ``If yes, what will be the magnitude of countering
it?''. This exploration will help develop mechanisms to guide users'
misinformation correction efforts and to measure disparity across users who get
corrected. In this work, we first create a novel dataset with 690,047 pairs of
misinformation tweets and counter-misinformation replies. Then, stratified
analysis of tweet linguistic and engagement features as well as tweet posters'
user attributes are conducted to illustrate the factors that are significant in
determining whether a tweet will get countered. Finally, predictive classifiers
are created to predict the likelihood of a misinformation tweet to get
countered and the degree to which that tweet will be countered. The code and
data is accessible on https://github.com/claws-lab/social-correction-twitter.

occurred between December 2019 and April 2020, gives us unprecedented insight
into the processes occurring on the stellar surface and in the inner wind of
this type of star. In particular it may bring further understanding of their
dust nucleation and mass loss processes. Here, we present and analyse
VLTI/MATISSE observations in the N-band (8 - 13 $\mu$m) taken near the
brightness minimum in order to assess the status of the dusty circumstellar
environment. We explore the compatibility of a dust clump obscuring the star
with our mid-infrared interferometric observations using continuum 3D radiative
transfer modelling, and probe the effect of adding multiple clumps close to the
star on the observables. We also test the viability of a large cool spot on the
stellar surface without dust present in the ambient medium. Using the
visibility data, we derive a uniform disk diameter of 59.02 $\pm$ 0.64 mas in
the spectral range 8 to 8.75 $\mu$m. We find that both the dust clump and the
cool spot models are compatible with the data. Further to this, we note that
the extinction and emission of our localised dust clump in the line of sight of
the star, directly compensate each other making the clump undetectable in the
spectral energy distribution and visibilities. The lack of infrared brightening
during the 'Great Dimming' therefore does not exclude extinction due to a dust
clump as one of the possible mechanisms. The visibilities can be reproduced by
a spherical wind with dust condensing at 13 stellar radii and a dust mass-loss
rate of (2.1 - 4.9) $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ $\mathit{M}_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$,

SelfCheckGPT leverages the simple idea that if a LLM has knowledge of a given
concept, sampled responses are likely to be similar and contain consistent
facts. However, for hallucinated facts, stochastically sampled responses are
likely to diverge and contradict one another. We investigate this approach by
using GPT-3 to generate passages about individuals from the WikiBio dataset,
and manually annotate the factuality of the generated passages. We demonstrate
that SelfCheckGPT can: i) detect non-factual and factual sentences; and ii)
rank passages in terms of factuality. We compare our approach to several

AUC-PR scores comparable to or better than grey-box methods, while SelfCheckGPT

accurate theoretical predictions. N-body simulations are required to explore
the non-linear regime of structure formation but are very time consuming. In
this work, we build an emulator, dubbed e-MANTIS, that performs an accurate and
fast interpolation between the predictions of a given set of cosmological
simulations, in $f(R)$ modified gravity, run with ECOSMOG. We sample a wide 3D
parameter space given by the current background scalar field value $10^{-7} <
\left|f_{R_0} \right| < 10^{-4}$, matter density $0.24<\Omega_\mathrm{m}<0.39$,
and primordial power spectrum normalisation $0.6<\sigma_8<1.0$, with 110 points
sampled from a Latin Hypercube. For each model we perform pairs of $f(R)$CDM
and $\Lambda$CDM simulations covering an effective volume of $\left(560 \,

h^{-1} M_\odot$. We compute the matter power spectrum boost due to $f(R)$
gravity $B(k)=P_{f(R)}(k)/P_{\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}}(k)$ and build an emulator
using a Gaussian Process Regression method. The boost is mostly independent of
$h$, $n_{s}$, and $\Omega_{b}$, which reduces the dimensionality of the
relevant cosmological parameter space. Additionally, it is much more robust
against statistical and systematic errors than the raw power spectrum, thus
strongly reducing our computational needs. The resulting emulator has a maximum
error of $3\%$ across the whole cosmological parameter space, for scales $0.03
\ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} < k < 7 \ h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and redshifts $0 < z < 2$,
while in most cases the accuracy is better than $1\%$. Such an emulator could

allowing us to collaborate on and defer actions to others, and intrinsic value
in our intimate relationships with romantic partners, family, and friends. In
this paper I examine the nature of trust from a philosophical perspective.
Specifically I propose to view trust as a context-sensitive state in a manner
that will be made precise. The contribution of this paper is threefold.
  First, I make the simple observation that an individual's trust is typically
both action- and context-sensitive. Action-sensitivity means that trust may
obtain between a given truster and trustee for only certain actions.
Context-sensitivity means that trust may obtain between a given truster and
trustee, regarding the same action, in some conditions and not others. I also
opine about what kinds of things may play the role of the truster, trustee, and
action.
  Second, I advance a theory for the nature of contextual trust. I propose that
the answer to ""What does it mean for $A$ to trust $B$ to do $X$ in context
$C$?"" has two conditions. First, $A$ must take $B$'s doing $X$ as a means
towards one of $A$'s ends. Second, $A$ must adopt an unquestioning attitude
concerning $B$'s doing $X$ in context $C$. This unquestioning attitude is
similar to the attitude introduced in Nguyen 2021.
  Finally, we explore how contextual trust can help us make sense of trust in
general non-interpersonal settings, notably that of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems. The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) assigns
paramount importance to the problem of user trust in opaque computational
models, yet does little to give trust diagnostic or even conceptual criteria. I
propose that contextual trust is a natural fit for the task by illustrating
that model transparency and explainability map nicely into our construction of
the contexts $C$.

models of inflation, and creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power
spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers, whose amplitude is
characterized by $b_{\phi}$. Knowledge of $b_{\phi}$ for the observed tracer
population is therefore crucial for learning about inflation from LSS.
Recently, it has been shown that the relationship between linear bias $b_1$ and
$b_{\phi}$ for simulated halos exhibits significant secondary dependence on
halo concentration. We leverage this fact to forecast multi-tracer constraints
on $f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}$. We train a machine learning model on observable
properties of simulated Illustris-TNG galaxies to predict $b_{\phi}$ for
samples constructed to approximate DESI emission line galaxies (ELGs) and
luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We find $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 2.3$,
and $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 3.7$, respectively. These forecasted
errors are roughly factors of 3, and 35\% improvements over the single-tracer
case for each sample, respectively. When considering both ELGs and LRGs in
their overlap region, we forecast $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) = 1.5$ is
attainable with our learned model, more than a factor of 3 improvement over the
single-tracer case, while the ideal split by $b_{\phi}$ could reach
$\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}}) <1$. We also perform multi-tracer forecasts for
upcoming spectroscopic surveys targeting LPNG (MegaMapper, SPHEREx) and show
that splitting tracer samples by $b_{\phi}$ can lead to an order-of-magnitude
reduction in projected $\sigma(f_{NL}^{\mathrm{loc}})$ for these surveys.

Furthermore, we propose a Video-to-Video Suppression network (VVS) as a

suppression weight generation stage for determining how much to suppress the

probe-commit model. In this problem, when an online vertex arrives, its edges
must be probed to determine if they exist, based on known edge probabilities. A
probing algorithm must respect commitment, meaning that if a probed edge
exists, it must be used in the matching. Additionally, each online vertex has a
patience constraint which limits the number of probes that can be made to an
online vertex's adjacent edges. We introduce a new configuration linear program
(LP) which we prove is a relaxation of an optimal offline probing algorithm.
Using this LP, we establish the following competitive ratios which depend on
the model used to generate the instance graph, and the arrival order of its
online vertices:
  - In the worst-case instance model, an optimal $1/e$ ratio when the vertices
arrive in uniformly at random (u.a.r.) order.
  - In the known independently distributed (i.d.) instance model, an optimal
$1/2$ ratio when the vertices arrive in adversarial order, and a $1-1/e$ ratio
when the vertices arrive in u.a.r. order.
  The latter two results improve upon the previous best competitive ratio of
$0.46$ due to Brubach et al. (Algorithmica 2020), which only held in the more
restricted known i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) instance
model. Our $1-1/e$-competitive algorithm matches the best known result for the
prophet secretary matching problem due to Ehsani et al. (SODA 2018). Our
algorithm is efficient and implies a $1-1/e$ approximation ratio for the

vehicular communication links, which fluctuate between line-of-sight (LoS) and

physical-layer re-authentication for message verification. However, the
latter's detection probability (P_d) decreases with the reduction of the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, we examine using Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) to enhance the SNR value directed toward the
designated vehicle and consequently improve the P_d, especially for NLoS
scenarios. We conducted theoretical analysis and practical implementation of
the proposed scheme using a 1-bit RIS, consisting of 64 x 64 reflective units.
Experimental results show a significant improvement in the P_d, increasing from
0.82 to 0.96 at SNR = - 6 dB for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
system with 128 subcarriers. We also conducted informal and formal security
analyses, using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN)-logic, to prove the scheme's
ability to resist passive and active attacks. Finally, the computation and
communication comparisons demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
scheme compared to traditional crypto-based methods.

in CEERS_1019, a galaxy previously discovered via a Ly$\alpha$-break by Hubble
and with a Ly$\alpha$ redshift from Keck. As part of the Cosmic Evolution Early
Release Science (CEERS) survey, we observed this source with JWST/NIRSpec
spectroscopy, MIRI and NIRCam imaging, and NIRCam/WFSS slitless spectroscopy.
The NIRSpec spectra uncover many emission lines, and the strong [O III]
emission line confirms the ground-based Ly$\alpha$ redshift. We detect a
significant broad (FWHM~1200 km/s) component in the H$\beta$ emission line,
which we conclude originates in the broad-line region of an active galactic
nucleus (AGN), as the lack of a broad component in the forbidden lines rejects
an outflow origin. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of
high-ionization lines, as well as a spatial point-source component embedded
within a smoother surface brightness profile. The mass of the black hole is
log($M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.95{\pm}0.37$, and we estimate that it is accreting at
1.2 ($\pm$0.5) x the Eddington limit. The 1-8 $\mu$m photometric spectral
energy distribution (SED) from NIRCam and MIRI shows a continuum dominated by
starlight and constrains the host galaxy to be massive (log M/M$_{\odot}$~9.5)
and highly star-forming (SFR~30 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). Ratios of the strong
emission lines show that the gas in this galaxy is metal-poor
(Z/Z$_{\odot}$~0.1), dense (n$_{e}$~10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$), and highly ionized
(log U~-2.1), consistent with the general galaxy population observed with JWST
at high redshifts. We use this presently highest-redshift AGN discovery to
place constraints on black hole seeding models and find that a combination of
either super-Eddington accretion from stellar seeds or Eddington accretion from
massive black hole seeds is required to form this object by the observed epoch.

static embedding as the class token for diverse inputs, we propose a dynamic
class token generator that produces a class token for each input video by
analyzing the hand-object interaction and the related motion information. The
dynamic class token can diffuse such information to the entire model by
communicating with other informative tokens in the subsequent transformer
layers. With the dynamic class token, dissimilarity between videos can be more
prominent, which helps the model distinguish various inputs. In addition,
traditional video transformers explore temporal features globally, which
requires large amounts of computation. However, egocentric videos often have a
large amount of background scene transition, which causes discontinuities
across distant frames. In this case, blindly reducing the temporal sampling
rate will risk losing crucial information. Hence, we also propose a pyramid
architecture to hierarchically process the video from short-term high rate to
long-term low rate. With the proposed architecture, we significantly reduce the
computational cost as well as the memory requirement without sacrificing from
the model performance. We perform comparisons with different baseline video
transformers on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA Gaze+ datasets. Both
quantitative and qualitative results show that the proposed model can
efficiently improve the performance for egocentric action recognition.

We discuss recent results on the clustering, composition and

composition records deviations from proton, we noted that the UHECR events
above 40 EeV can be made not just by any light or heavy nuclei, but mainly by
the lightest ones as He,D, Li,Be. The remarkable Virgo absence and the few
localized nearby extragalactic sources, such as CenA, NGC 253 and M82, are
naturally understood: lightest UHECR nuclei cannot reach us from the Virgo
distance of twenty Mpc, due to their nuclei fragility above a few Mpc
distances. Their deflection and smearing in wide hot spots is better tuned to
the lighter nuclei than to the preferred proton or heavy nuclei candidate
courier. We note that these lightest nuclei still suffer of a partial
photodistruction even from such close sources. Therefore, their distruption in
fragments, within few tens EeV multiplet chain of events, have been expected
and later on observed by Auger collaboration, nearly a decade ago. These
multiplet presences, strongly correlate with the same CenA, NGC253 sources. The
statistical weight of such correlation is reminded. We conclude that the same
role of NGC 253 clustering at lower energies could also feed the Auger dipole
anisotropy at lower energy ranges, integrated by nearest Vela, Crab, LMC and
Cas A contributes. In our present UHECR model, based on lightest nuclei in
local volumes of a few Mpcs, closest AGN, Star-Burst or very close SNR are
superimposing their signals, frozen in different epochs, distances and
directions, feeding small and wide anisotropy. Possible tests to confirm, or

different health care providers with various scientific levels and writing

information is essential when dealing with extensive electronic medical
records. Entities recognizing and mapping them to standard terminologies is
crucial in reducing ambiguity in processing clinical notes. Although named
entity recognition and entity linking are critical steps in clinical natural
language processing, they can also result in the production of repetitive and
low-value concepts. In other hand, all parts of a clinical text do not share
the same importance or content in predicting the patient's condition. As a
result, it is necessary to identify the section in which each content is
recorded and also to identify key concepts to extract meaning from clinical
texts. In this study, these challenges have been addressed by using clinical
natural language processing techniques. In addition, in order to identify key
concepts, a set of popular unsupervised key phrase extraction methods has been
verified and evaluated. Considering that most of the clinical concepts are in
the form of multi-word expressions and their accurate identification requires
the user to specify n-gram range, we have proposed a shortcut method to
preserve the structure of the expression based on TF-IDF. In order to evaluate
the pre-processing method and select the concepts, we have designed two types
of downstream tasks (multiple and binary classification) using the capabilities
of transformer-based models. The obtained results show the superiority of
proposed method in combination with SciBERT model, also offer an insight into
the efficacy of general extracting essential phrase methods for clinical notes.

we use a recently proposed encoder-decoder graph neural network involving
Capsule networks and multi-head attention mechanism, and innovatively add
topological descriptors (TD) as new features to improve transferability to
unseen problems of similar and larger size. Persistent homology is used to
derive the TD, and proximal policy optimization is used to train our

favorably to state-of-the-art non-learning baselines while being much faster.

assuredly correct response, one has to ""understand"" the semantics of a
sentence. To achieve this ""understanding"", logic-based (commonsense) reasoning
methods such as Answer Set Programming (ASP) are arguably needed. In this
paper, we describe the AutoConcierge system that leverages LLMs and ASP to
develop a conversational agent that can truly ""understand"" human dialogs in

AutoConcierge will interactively understand a user's utterances, identify the

information has been received, it computes a restaurant recommendation based on
the user-preferences it has acquired from the human user. AutoConcierge is
based on our STAR framework developed earlier, which uses GPT-3 to convert
human dialogs into predicates that capture the deep structure of the dialog's
sentence. These predicates are then input into the goal-directed s(CASP) ASP
system for performing commonsense reasoning. To the best of our knowledge,
AutoConcierge is the first automated conversational agent that can
realistically converse like a human and provide help to humans based on truly

The critical step of this task is to effectively extract domain-shared and
domain-private RGB/depth features. In addition, three detailed issues, namely
blurry edges, noisy surfaces, and over-transferred RGB texture, need to be
addressed. In this paper, we propose the Spherical Space feature Decomposition
Network (SSDNet) to solve the above issues. To better model cross-modality
features, Restormer block-based RGB/depth encoders are employed for extracting
local-global features. Then, the extracted features are mapped to the spherical
space to complete the separation of private features and the alignment of
shared features. Shared features of RGB are fused with the depth features to
complete the GDSR task. Subsequently, a spherical contrast refinement (SCR)
module is proposed to further address the detail issues. Patches that are
classified according to imperfect categories are input to the SCR module, where
the patch features are pulled closer to the ground truth and pushed away from
the corresponding imperfect samples in the spherical feature space via
contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can
achieve state-of-the-art results on four test datasets and can successfully
generalize to real-world scenes. Code will be released.

Xiang et al. learn a prediction model to be robust to two-mask operations by
augmenting the training set with pairs of masks at random locations of training

a specific case involving a system of three interacting domains: a copper rod
projectile impacting onto a soda lime glass target in a neon gas environment.
The impact velocity is varied between 3 km/s and 6 km/s in different

certain 1-forms lack this scale factor since the extra dimension, often assumed
to be compactified, would not be affected by the cosmological expansion. The
result is a viable wormhole model of the Sung-Won Kim type. Our main conclusion
involves Morris-Thorne wormholes: due to the Kaluza-Klein gravity, we obtain a
complete wormhole solution without crossing the phantom divide.

Their minimizing systems satisfy implicit-in-time schemes for initial value

time-domain astronomy, with an expected 10 million alerts per-night, and
generating many petabytes of data over the lifetime of the survey. Fast and
efficient classification algorithms that can operate in real-time, yet robustly

can be sought for follow-up analyses. In order to handle such data,
state-of-the-art deep learning architectures coupled with tools that leverage
modern hardware accelerators are essential. We showcase how the use of modern
deep compression methods can achieve a $18\times$ reduction in model size,
whilst preserving classification performance. We also show that in addition to
the deep compression techniques, careful choice of file formats can improve
inference latency, and thereby throughput of alerts, on the order of $8\times$
for local processing, and $5\times$ in a live production setting. To test this
in a live setting, we deploy this optimised version of the original time-series
transformer, t2, into the community alert broking system of FINK on real Zwicky

other science modules that exist in FINK. The results shown herein emphasise
the time-series transformer's suitability for real-time classification at LSST

by the central quasar dominates the ionization state of the gas with no obvious
sign for a major contribution from hot young stars anywhere in the host galaxy.
Rest-frame near-ultraviolet emission aligned along the wide-angle cone of
outflowing gas is interpreted as a scattering cone. The outflow has cleared a
channel in the dusty host galaxy through which some of the quasar ionizing
radiation is able to escape and heat the surrounding interstellar and
circumgalactic media. The warm ionized outflow is not powerful enough to impact
the host galaxy via mechanical feedback, but radiative feedback by the AGN,
aided by the outflow, may help explain the unusually small molecular gas mass
fraction in the galaxy host.

large-scale linear systems. However, the performance of these iterative Krylov

The $s$-step strategy generates a series of $s$ Krylov vectors at a time to
avoid communication. Asymptotically, the $s$-step approach can reduce
communication latency by a factor of $s$. Unfortunately, due to
finite-precision implementation, the step size has to be kept small for
stability. In this work, we tackle the numerical instabilities encountered in
the $s$-step GMRES algorithm. By choosing an appropriate polynomial basis and
block orthogonalization schemes, we construct a communication avoiding $s$-step
GMRES algorithm that automatically selects the optimal step size to ensure
numerical stability. To further maximize communication savings, we introduce
scaled Newton polynomials that can increase the step size $s$ to a few hundreds
for many problems. An initial step size estimator is also developed to
efficiently choose the optimal step size for stability. The guaranteed
stability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using numerical
experiments. In the process, we also evaluate how the choice of polynomial and
preconditioning affects the stability limit of the algorithm. Finally, we show
parallel scalability on more than 14,000 cores in a distributed-memory setting.
Perfectly linear scaling has been observed in both strong and weak scaling

gathered increasing attention due to their intense electron-hole interactions,
being considered promising candidates for developing novel optical
applications. Within the few-layer regime, these systems become highly
sensitive to the surrounding environment, enabling the possibility of using a
proper substrate to tune desired aspects of these atomically-thin
semiconductors. In this scenario, the dielectric environment provided by the
substrates exerts significant influence on electronic and optical properties of
these layered materials, affecting the electronic band-gap and the exciton
binding energy. However, the corresponding effect on the luminescence of
transition metal dichalcogenides is still under discussion. To elucidate these
impacts, we used a broad set of materials as substrates for single-layers of
WSe$_2$, enabling the observation of these effects over a wide range of
electrical permittivities. Our results demonstrate that an increasing
permittivity induces a systematic red-shift of the optical band-gap of WSe$_2$,
intrinsically related to a considerable reduction of the luminescence
intensity. Moreover, we annealed the samples to ensure a tight coupling between
WSe$_2$and its substrates, reducing the effect of undesired adsorbates trapped
in the interface. Ultimately, our findings reveal how critical the annealing
temperature can be, indicating that above a certain threshold, the heating
treatment can induce adverse impacts on the luminescence. Furthermore, our
conclusions highlight the influence the dielectric properties of the substrate
have on the luminescence of WSe$_2$, showing that a low electrical permittivity
favours preserving the native properties of the adjacent monolayer

temporal networks have two main limitations: (1) they adopt pre-defined
subgraph patterns to model communities, which cannot find communities that do
not conform to these patterns in real-world networks, and (2) they only use the
aggregation of disjoint structural information to measure quality, missing the

update node embeddings over time. We demonstrate how this model can be used for

direction is a new protocol proposed in [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 043256 (2020)] to
produce dark solitons in a one-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) by quenching inter-atomic interaction. Motivated by this work, we
generalize the protocol to a two-dimensional BEC and investigate the general
scenario of its post-quench dynamics. For an isotropic disk trap with a
hard-wall boundary, we find that successive inward-moving ring dark solitons
(RDSs) can be induced from the edge, and the number of RDSs can be controlled
by tuning the ratio of the after- and before-quench interaction strength across
different critical values. The role the quench played on the profiles of the
density, phase, and sound velocity is also investigated. Due to the snake
instability, the RDSs then become vortex-antivortex pairs with peculiar
dynamics managed by the initial density and the after-quench interaction. By
tuning the geometry of the box traps, demonstrated as polygonal ones, more
subtle dynamics of solitons and vortices are enabled. Our proposed protocol and
the discovered rich dynamical effects on nonlinear excitations can be realized

  In this article we introduce a new benchmark suite for evaluating the

parameters greatly impact performance and the need for global optimization. The
importance of each parameter is consistent across GPU architectures, however,
the specific values need to be optimized for each architecture.

ASSL involves more dynamic model updates than AL due to the use of unlabeled

predicted probabilities of the unlabeled data. This makes it difficult to
determine the true uncertainty of the unlabeled data in ASSL. To address this,
we adopted techniques such as exponential moving average (EMA) and upper

analyzed the effect of label noise on unsupervised learning by using weak and
strong augmentation pairs to address datainconsistency. By considering both

we present a continuously tunable moir\'e potential in a monolayer WSe2 that is

dynamically tunable dielectric superlattice for modulating monolayer exciton
wavefunctions. By performing optical reflection spectroscopy, we observe
emergent moir\'e exciton Rydberg branches in monolayer WSe2 with increased
energy splitting upon doping TBG. The twist-angle dependence reveals that the
observation is due to a hybridization between bright and dark Rydberg states
enabled by the moir\'e potential. Further, at the magic-angle near 1.1{\deg},
the moir\'e Rydberg excitons form a sawtooth pattern with doping owing to the
formation of strongly correlated states in the TBG. Our study provides a new

statistical models whose probability density function is known up to
proportionality but whose normalizing constant is intractable. For such models,
maximum likelihood estimation will be difficult or impossible to implement. To
date, nearly all applications of score matching have focused on continuous IID
(independent and identically distributed) models. Motivated by various data
modelling problems for which the continuity assumption and/or the IID
assumption are not appropriate, this article proposes three novel extensions of
score matching: (i) to univariate and multivariate ordinal data (including
count data); (ii) to INID (independent but not necessarily identically
distributed) data models, including regression models with either a continuous
or a discrete ordinal response; and (iii) to a class of dependent data models
known as auto models. Under the INID assumption, a unified asymptotic approach
to settings (i) and (ii) is developed and, under mild regularity conditions, it
is proved that the proposed score matching estimators are consistent and
asymptotically normal. These theoretical results provide a sound basis for
score-matching-based inference and are supported by strong performance in
simulation studies and a real data example involving doctoral publication data.
Regarding (iii), motivated by a spatial geochemical dataset, we develop a novel
auto model for spatially dependent spherical data and propose a
score-matching-based Wald statistic to test for the presence of spatial
dependence. Our proposed auto model exhibits a way to model spatial dependence
of directions, is computationally convenient to use and is expected to be
superior to composite likelihood approaches for reasons that are explained.

to-server (D2S) interaction structure of federated model training with

over practical edge networks with multiple D2D clusters modeled as time-varying
and directed communication graphs. Our investigation results in an algorithm
that controls the fundamental trade-off between (a) the rate of convergence of
the model training process towards the global optimizer, and (b) the number of
D2S transmissions required for global aggregation. Specifically, in our
semi-decentralized methodology, D2D consensus updates are injected into the
federated averaging framework based on column-stochastic weight matrices that
encapsulate the connectivity within the clusters. To arrive at our algorithm,
we show how the expected optimality gap in the current global model depends on
the greatest two singular values of the weighted adjacency matrices (and hence
on the densities) of the D2D clusters. We then derive tight bounds on these
singular values in terms of the node degrees of the D2D clusters, and we use
the resulting expressions to design a threshold on the number of clients
required to participate in any given global aggregation round so as to ensure a
desired convergence rate. Simulations performed on real-world datasets reveal
that our connectivity-aware algorithm reduces the total communication cost
required to reach a target accuracy significantly compared with baselines

and computed by a GEMM operation, where these GEMM operations could reach up to
90\% of the total calculation time. GEMM throughput can be improved by
utilizing mixed-precision hardware such as Tensor Cores, but straightforward
implementation results in insufficient fidelity for deep and large quantum
circuits. Prior work has demonstrated that compensated summation with special
care of the rounding mode can fully recover the FP32 precision of SGEMM even
when using TF32 or FP16 Tensor Cores. The exponent range is a critical issue
when applying such techniques to quantum circuit simulation. While TF32
supports almost the same exponent range as FP32, FP16 supports a much smaller
exponent range. In this work, we use the exponent range statistics of input
tensor elements to select which Tensor Cores we use for the GEMM. We evaluate
our method on Random Circuit Sampling (RCS), including Sycamore's quantum

structure on the tangent space at a fixed point of the homological vector
field. From the field theory perspective this implies that the expansion of a
Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formulation around a vacuum solution can be
equivalently cast into the form of an $L_\infty$-algebra. In so doing, the BV
symplectic structure determines a compatible cyclic structure on the
$L_\infty$-algebra. Moreover, $L_\infty$ quasi-isomorphisms correspond to
so-called equivalent reductions (also known as the elimination of generalized
auxiliary fields) of the respective BV systems. Although at the formal level
the relation is straightforward, its implementation in field theory requires
some care because the underlying spaces become infinite-dimensional. In the
case of local gauge theories, the relevant spaces can be approximated by nearly
finite-dimensional ones through employing the jet-bundle technique. In this
work we study the $L_\infty$-counterpart of the jet-bundle BV approach and
generalise it to a more flexible setup of so-called gauge PDEs. It turns out
that in the latter case the underlying $L_\infty$-structure is analogous to
that of Chern-Simons theory. In particular, the underlying liner space is a
module over the space-time exterior algebra and the higher $L_\infty$-maps are
multilinear. Furthermore, a counterpart of the cyclic structure turns out to be
degenerate and possibly nonlinear, and corresponds to a compatible
presymplectic structure the gauge PDE, which is known to encode the BV
symplectic structure and hence the full-scale Lagrangian BV formulation.
Moreover, given a degenerate cyclic structure one can consistently relax the
$L_\infty$-axioms in such a way that the formalism still describes
non-topological models but involves only finitely-generated modules, as we
illustrate in the example of Yang-Mills theory.

Computing these decisions often requires solving Capacity Expansion Problems

prohibitively expensive to solve due to large network sizes, heterogeneous node
characteristics, and a large number of operational periods. To maintain
tractability, traditional approaches aggregate network nodes and/or select a
set of representative time periods. Often, these reductions do not capture
supply-demand variations that crucially impact CEP costs and constraints,
leading to suboptimal decisions. Here, we propose a novel graph convolutional
autoencoder approach for spatio-temporal aggregation of a generic CEP with
heterogeneous nodes (CEPHN). Our architecture leverages graph pooling to
identify nodes with similar characteristics and minimizes a multi-objective
loss function. This loss function is tailored to induce desirable spatial and
temporal aggregations with regard to tractability and optimality. In
particular, the output of the graph pooling provides a spatial aggregation
while clustering the low-dimensional encoded representations yields a temporal
aggregation. We apply our approach to generation expansion planning of a
coupled 88-node power and natural gas system in New England. The resulting
aggregation leads to a simpler CEPHN with 6 nodes and a small set of
representative days selected from one year. We evaluate aggregation outcomes

resulting upper bounds on the original problem with those obtained using

performance. Then, we identify two issues that can cause performance
degradation on food images during the training phase: (1) inter-class feature
entanglement during multi-food classes training and (2) loss of high-resolution
detail during image downsampling. To address both issues, we propose to train
one food category at a time to avoid feature entanglement and leverage image
patches cropped from high-resolution datasets to retain fine details. We
evaluate our method on the Food-101 dataset and show improved quality of
generated synthetic food images compared with the baseline. Finally, we
demonstrate the great potential of improving the performance of downstream
tasks, such as food image classification by including high-quality synthetic
training samples in the data augmentation.

However, while legislatures around the world have enacted regulations to
protect children's online privacy, and app stores have instituted various
protections, privacy in mobile apps remains a growing concern for parents and
wider society. In this paper, we explore the potential privacy issues and
threats that exist in these apps. We investigate 20,195 mobile apps from the
Google Play store that are designed particularly for children (Family apps) or
include children in their target user groups (Normal apps). Using both static
and dynamic analysis, we find that 4.47% of Family apps request location
permissions, even though collecting location information from children is
forbidden by the Play store, and 81.25% of Family apps use trackers (which are
not allowed in children's apps). Even major developers with 40+ kids apps on
the Play store use ad trackers. Furthermore, we find that most permission
request notifications are not well designed for children, and 19.25% apps have
inconsistent content age ratings across the different protection authorities.
Our findings suggest that, despite significant attention to children's privacy,
a large gap between regulatory provisions, app store policies, and actual
development practices exist. Our research sheds light for government
policymakers, app stores, and developers.

improved functionalities would be greatly aided by accurate computations.
However, the competition among the different effects poses a challenge for

lunar propellant production had disagreed over this. The ""gear ratio on cost""

prior TEAs are examined for how they handled these two metrics. This identifies
crucial mistakes in some of the TEAs: choosing transportation architectures

adequate phi. The tent sublimation technology has a value of phi that is an
order of magnitude better than the threshold for competitiveness even in low

technological improvements plus several years of operating experience will
improve its competitiveness, according to the model. Objections from members of

a power plant inspection system incorporating UAV autonomous navigation and DQN
reinforcement learning. These training processes set reward functions with

now in use. The key components of the reinforcement learning segment of the
technique, for instance, introduce states such as the simulation of a wind

computation beyond the core LLM capabilities (e.g. search/running code). Prior
work on CoT prompting and tool use typically requires hand-crafting
task-specific demonstrations and carefully scripted interleaving of model
generations with tool use. We introduce Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use (ART),
a framework that uses frozen LLMs to automatically generate intermediate
reasoning steps as a program. Given a new task to solve, ART selects
demonstrations of multi-step reasoning and tool use from a task library. At
test time, ART seamlessly pauses generation whenever external tools are called,
and integrates their output before resuming generation. ART achieves a
substantial improvement over few-shot prompting and automatic CoT on unseen
tasks in the BigBench and MMLU benchmarks, and matches performance of
hand-crafted CoT prompts on a majority of these tasks. ART is also extensible,
and makes it easy for humans to improve performance by correcting errors in
task-specific programs or incorporating new tools, which we demonstrate by
drastically improving performance on select tasks with minimal human

heavily driven by resubmissions of borderline papers - therefore, a judicious
choice of acceptance threshold may lead to fewer reviews while incurring an
acceptable loss in conference quality. 3) conference prestige, reviewer
inaccuracy, and author patience increase the resubmission gap, and thus
increase the review load for a fixed level of conference quality. For

on only one of the states of the doublet. Taking as an example case the light
exotic electroweak doublet present in the Minimal Composite Higgs Model, we
show that including three-body decays in the pair production process makes this
separation unfeasible, since both states of the doublet will be present and
contribute significantly to the signal. In addition, by recasting present
searches in multileptonic channels, with a simplified cut-and-count analysis, a
relevant increase in discovery reach or exclusion potential is obtained; this
indeed motivates a more detailed analysis. This study shows how an inclusive

class of objects but also detect their size. Deep learning (DL), particularly
through the use of deep neural networks (DNNs), has become the primary approach
to object detection. However, obtaining accurate fine-grained detection
requires a large DNN model and a significant amount of annotated data,
presenting a challenge to solve our problem particularly for
resource-constrained scenarios. To this end, we propose an approach that
utilizes commonsense knowledge to assist a coarse-grained object detector in
achieving accurate size-related fine-grained detection results. Specifically,
we introduce a commonsense knowledge inference module (CKIM) that processes the
coarse-grained labels produced by a benchmark coarse-grained DL detector to
generate size-related fine-grained labels. Our CKIM explores both crisp-rule
and fuzzy-rule based inference methods, with the latter being employed to
handle ambiguity in the target size-related labels. We implement our method
based on two modern DL detectors, including Mobilenet-SSD, and YOLOv7-tiny.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate
fine-grained detections with a reduced amount of annotated data, and smaller
model size. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZJLAB-AMMI/CKIM.

this performance metric based on the learned rewards. Such RL training is not
straightforward since both the reward function and the policy are trained using

Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In this paper, we propose an exploration method
that efficiently encourages cooperative exploration based on the idea of the
theoretically justified tree search algorithm UCT (Upper Confidence bounds
applied to Trees). The high-level intuition is that to perform optimism-based
exploration, agents would achieve cooperative strategies if each agent's
optimism estimate captures a structured dependency relationship with other
agents. At each node (i.e., action) of the search tree, UCT performs
optimism-based exploration using a bonus derived by conditioning on the
visitation count of its parent node. We provide a perspective to view MARL as
tree search iterations and develop a method called Conditionally Optimistic
Exploration (COE). We assume agents take actions following a sequential order,
and consider nodes at the same depth of the search tree as actions of one
individual agent. COE computes each agent's state-action value estimate with an
optimistic bonus derived from the visitation count of the state and joint
actions taken by agents up to the current agent. COE is adaptable to any value
decomposition method for centralized training with decentralized execution.
Experiments across various cooperative MARL benchmarks show that COE
outperforms current state-of-the-art exploration methods on hard-exploration

challenges in facial expression analysis, such as scaling, annotation bias, the
discrepancy between discrete labels and continuous emotions, and model
pre-training. Such motivated, we propose a UFER method with contrastive local
warping (ContraWarping), which leverages the insight that the emotional
expression is robust to current global transformation (affine transformation,
color jitter, etc.) but can be easily changed by random local warping.
Therefore, given a facial image, ContraWarping employs some global
transformations and local warping to generate its positive and negative samples
and sets up a novel contrastive learning framework. Our in-depth investigation
shows that: 1) the positive pairs from global transformations may be exploited
with general self-supervised learning (e.g., BYOL) and already bring some
informative features, and 2) the negative pairs from local warping explicitly
introduce expression-related variation and further bring substantial
improvement. Based on ContraWarping, we demonstrate the benefit of UFER under
two facial expression analysis scenarios: facial expression recognition and
image retrieval. For example, directly using ContraWarping features for linear
probing achieves 79.14% accuracy on RAF-DB, significantly reducing the gap
towards the full-supervised counterpart (88.92% / 84.81% with/without

also maintains linear complexity. Moreover, our SM-FFN proposes the
self-modulation that intensifies the activations of more informative regions,

visual and motion cues only, making them susceptible to inaccurate
localization. Recently, discriminative models via a temporal class activation
mapping (CAM) method have been explored. Although results are promising,
objects are assumed to have minimal movement leading to degradation in
performance for relatively long-term dependencies. In this paper, a novel
CoLo-CAM method for object localization is proposed to leverage spatiotemporal
information in activation maps without any assumptions about object movement.
Over a given sequence of frames, explicit joint learning of localization is
produced across these maps based on color cues, by assuming an object has
similar color across frames. The CAMs' activations are constrained to activate
similarly over pixels with similar colors, achieving co-localization. This
joint learning creates direct communication among pixels across all image
locations, and over all frames, allowing for transfer, aggregation, and
correction of learned localization. This is achieved by minimizing a color term
of a CRF loss over joint images/maps. In addition to our multi-frame
constraint, we impose per-frame local constraints including pseudo-labels, and
CRF loss in combination with a global size constraint to improve per-frame
localization. Empirical experiments on two challenging datasets for
unconstrained videos, YouTube-Objects, show the merits of our method, and its
robustness to long-term dependencies, leading to new state-of-the-art
localization performance. Public code: https://github.com/sbelharbi/colo-cam.

which is the process of monitoring what kinds of food and how much energy is
consumed using captured food or eating scene images. Existing deep
learning-based methods learn the visual representation for downstream tasks
based on human annotation of each food image. However, most food images in real
life are obtained without labels, and data annotation requires plenty of time
and human effort, which is not feasible for real-world applications. To make
use of the vast amount of unlabeled images, many existing works focus on
unsupervised or self-supervised learning of visual representations directly
from unlabeled data. However, none of these existing works focus on food
images, which is more challenging than general objects due to its high
inter-class similarity and intra-class variance.
  In this paper, we focus on the implementation and analysis of existing
representative self-supervised learning methods on food images. Specifically,
we first compare the performance of six selected self-supervised learning
models on the Food-101 dataset. Then we analyze the pros and cons of each
selected model when training on food data to identify the key factors that can
help improve the performance. Finally, we propose several ideas for future work
on self-supervised visual representation learning for food images.

interactions and quenched disorder in the dynamics. Such systems are routinely
used to model collective emergent behaviour in multiple areas of social and
natural sciences as they exhibit, in the thermodynamic limit, both continuous
and discontinuous phase transitions. The goal of this contribution is twofold.
Firstly, we provide a framework to identify suitable reaction coordinates for
the system starting from the microscopic properties of the interaction
structure among the agents. We state conditions on the interactions that lead
to a dimension reduction of the system in terms of a finite number of reaction
coordinates. Secondly, we show that such reaction coordinates prove to be
proper nonequilibrium thermodynamic variables as they carry information on
correlation and memory properties and provide the natural way to probe the
sensitivity of the system to external perturbations. In particular, we prove
that the investigation of response properties of the observables corresponding
to the reaction coordinates allows to identify, pinpoint and characterise phase
transitions of the system as these manifest themselves as singularities in the
corresponding susceptibility function. We apply our theory, corroborated by
numerical evidence, to the investigation of static and dynamic phase
transitions of the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. Our approach allows us to prove
that the dynamic phase transition corresponds to an uncommon scenario of
resonance originating from a non-vanishing real part of the residue associated
to the singular part of the susceptibility. In this setting, the system
exhibits a coherent behaviour characterised by a spontaneously acquired
intrinsic phase, leading to the emergence of a phase shift of the response to
sinusoidal forcings at the critical frequency.

a more comprehensive view of the 3D morphology and evolution of the Musca
filament, we model the C$^{18}$O(2-1) emission along the filament crest with
several large-scale velocity field structures. This indicates that Musca is
well described by a 3D curved cylindrical filament with longitudinal mass
inflow to the center of the filament unless the filament is a transient
structure with a lifetime $\lesssim$~0.1 Myr. Gravitational longitudinal
collapse models of filaments appear unable to explain the observed velocity
field. To better understand these kinematics, we further analyze a map of the
C$^{18}$O(2-1) velocity field at the location of SOFIA HAWC+ dust polarization
observations that trace the magnetic field in the filament. This unveils an
organized magnetic field that is oriented roughly perpendicular to the filament
crest. Although the velocity field is also organized, it progressively changes
its orientation by more than 90$^{o}$ when laterally crossing the filament
crest and thus appears disconnected from the magnetic field in the filament.
This strong lateral change of the velocity field over the filament remains
unexplained and might be associated with important longitudinal motion in the
filament that can be associated to the large-scale kinematics along the

may exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport -- a magnetochiral anisotropy that
manifests as unequal electrical resistance for opposite current flow
directions. If superconductivity also sets in, the charge transmission may
become dissipationless in one direction while remaining dissipative in the
opposite, thereby realizing a superconducting diode. Through both DC and AC
magnetoresistance measurements, we study the nonreciprocal effects in thin
films of the superconducting noncentrosymmetric type-II Weyl semimetal
T$_d$-MoTe$_2$. We report nonreciprocal superconducting critical currents with
a diode efficiency close to 20\%~, and an extreme magnetochiral anisotropy
coefficient up to \SI{1e9}{\per\tesla\per\ampere}, under weak out-of-plane
magnetic field in the millitesla range. Intriguingly, unlike the finding in
Rashba systems, the strongest in-plane nonreciprocal effect does not occur when
the field is perpendicular to the current flow direction. We develop a
phenomenological theory to demonstrate that this peculiar behavior can be
attributed to the asymmetric structure of spin-orbit coupling in
T$_d$-MoTe$_2$. Our study highlights how the form of spin-orbit coupling, as
dictated by the underlying crystallographic symmetry, critically impacts the
nonreciprocal transport. Our work demonstrates that T$_d$-MoTe$_2$ offers an

Alternatively, we present a rationale for using complex multi-scale

the generation of SMMTD that minimizes the known shortcomings associated with

tree-structured sum-product network (t-SPN) is considered for cell
classification. The t-SPN is constructed such that the unnormalized probability
is represented as conditional probabilities of a subset of most similar cell
classes. The constructed t-SPN architecture is learned by maximizing the
margin, which is the difference in the conditional probability between the true
and the most competitive false label. To enhance the generalization ability of
the architecture, L2-regularization (REG) is considered along with the maximum
margin (MM) criterion in the learning process. To highlight cell features, this
paper investigates the effectiveness of two generic high-pass filters: ideal
high-pass filtering and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LOG) filtering. On both
HEp-2 and Feulgen benchmark datasets, the t-SPN architecture learned based on
the max-margin criterion with regularization produced the highest accuracy rate
compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms that include convolutional neural

on the HEp-2 dataset, which is based on immunofluorescence staining, while the
LOG was more effective on the Feulgen dataset, which is based on Feulgen

classification to improve the prediction accuracy. However, the
non-differentiability of the SVM hinge loss function can lead to computational
difficulties in high dimensional settings. To overcome this problem, we rely on
Bernstein polynomial and propose a new smoothed version of the SVM hinge loss
called the Bernstein support vector machine (BernSVM), which is suitable for
the high dimension $p >> n$ regime. As the BernSVM objective loss function is
of the class $C^2$, we propose two efficient algorithms for computing the
solution of the penalized BernSVM. The first algorithm is based on coordinate
descent with maximization-majorization (MM) principle and the second one is
IRLS-type algorithm (iterative re-weighted least squares). Under standard
assumptions, we derive a cone condition and a restricted strong convexity to
establish an upper bound for the weighted Lasso BernSVM estimator. Using a
local linear approximation, we extend the latter result to penalized BernSVM
with non convex penalties SCAD and MCP. Our bound holds with high probability
and achieves a rate of order $\sqrt{s\log(p)/n}$, where $s$ is the number of
active features. Simulation studies are considered to illustrate the prediction
accuracy of BernSVM to its competitors and also to compare the performance of
the two algorithms in terms of computational timing and error estimation. The
use of the proposed method is illustrated through analysis of three large-scale
real data examples.

(ML) techniques based on the decision tree algorithm have been employed.
However, these methods have limitations in processing tabular data where real
number attributes dominate. To address this issue, DeepInsight, REFINED, and
IGTD were proposed to convert tabular data into images for utilizing
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They gather similar features in some
specific spots of an image to make the converted image look like an actual
image. Gathering similar features contrasts with traditional ML techniques for
tabular data, which drops some highly correlated attributes to avoid
overfitting. Also, previous converting methods fixed the image size, and there
are wasted or insufficient pixels according to the number of attributes of
tabular data. Therefore, this paper proposes a new converting method, Vortex
Feature Positioning (VFP). VFP considers the correlation of features and places
similar features far away from each. Features are positioned in the vortex
shape from the center of an image, and the number of attributes determines the
image size. VFP shows better test performance than traditional ML techniques
for tabular data and previous converting methods in five datasets: Iris, Wine,
Dry Bean, Epileptic Seizure, and SECOM, which have differences in the number of
attributes.

vehicle (AV) design due to its significant impact on traffic efficiency.
Existing intelligent lane-change solutions have primarily focused on optimizing
the performance of the ego-vehicle, thereby suffering from limited
generalization performance. Recent research has seen an increased interest in
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based approaches to address the
limitation of the ego vehicle-based solutions through close coordination of
multiple agents. Although MARL-based approaches have shown promising results,
the potential impact of lane-change decisions on the overall traffic flow of a
road segment has not been fully considered. In this paper, we present a novel
hybrid MARL-based intelligent lane-change system for AVs designed to jointly
optimize the local performance for the ego vehicle, along with the global
performance focused on the overall traffic flow of a given road segment. With a
careful review of the relevant transportation literature, a novel state space
is designed to integrate both the critical local traffic information pertaining
to the surrounding vehicles of the ego vehicle, as well as the global traffic
information obtained from a road-side unit (RSU) responsible for managing a
road segment. We create a reward function to ensure that the agents make
effective lane-change decisions by considering the performance of the ego
vehicle and the overall improvement of traffic flow. A multi-agent deep
Q-network (DQN) algorithm is designed to determine the optimal policy for each
agent to effectively cooperate in performing lane-change maneuvers. LCS-TF's
performance was evaluated through extensive simulations in comparison with
state-of-the-art MARL models. In all aspects of traffic efficiency, driving
safety, and driver comfort, the results indicate that LCS-TF exhibits superior

dynamic range (HDR) imaging usually consists of demosaicing, white balancing,

noise from the imaging sensors, almost every step in the ISP introduces or
amplifies noise in different ways, and denoising operators are designed to
reduce the noise from these sources. Designed for dynamic range compressing,
tone-mapping operators in an ISP can significantly amplify the noise level,

short, concerns the satisfiability of polynomial formulas, which are
quantifier-free Boolean combinations of polynomial equations and inequalities
with integer coefficients and real variables. In this paper, we propose a local
search algorithm for a special subclass of SMT(NRA), where all constraints are
strict inequalities. An important fact is that, given a polynomial formula with
$n$ variables, the zero level set of the polynomials in the formula decomposes
the $n$-dimensional real space into finitely many components (cells) and every
polynomial has constant sign in each cell. The key point of our algorithm is a
new operation based on real root isolation, called cell-jump, which updates the
current assignment along a given direction such that the assignment can `jump'
from one cell to another. One cell-jump may adjust the values of several
variables while traditional local search operations, such as flip for SAT and
critical move for SMT(LIA), only change that of one variable. We also design a
two-level operation selection to balance the success rate and efficiency.
Furthermore, our algorithm can be easily generalized to a wider subclass of
SMT(NRA) where polynomial equations linear with respect to some variable are
allowed. Experiments show the algorithm is competitive with state-of-the-art
SMT solvers, and performs particularly well on those formulas with high-degree

mitigation of generation intermittencies. One underlying factor that can

a forecasting model which uses the solar variables to produce a PV generation

paper, a forecaster for irradiance prediction for intra-day is proposed. This
forecaster is capable of forecasting 15 minutes and hourly irradiance up to one

strength of the relationship between local weather parameters and system

second harmonic results follow the emission angle dependence as expected due to
elliptic flow, similar to that observed in Au+Au collisions. The polarization
relative to the third harmonic event plane, measured for the first time,
deviates from zero with 4.8$\sigma$ significance in 20-60\% centrality for
$1.1<p_T<6.0$ GeV/$c$ and exhibits a similar dependence on the emission angle.
These results indicate the formation of a complex vortical structure in the
system that follows higher harmonic anisotropic flow originating from the
initial density fluctuations. The amplitudes of the sine modulation for the
second and third harmonic results are comparable in magnitude, increase from
central to peripheral collisions, and show a mild $p_T$ dependence. While the
centrality dependence, except in peripheral collisions, is qualitatively
consistent with hydrodynamic model calculations including thermal vorticity and

models has recently gained popularity due to the great development of
pre-trained language models. In most previous studies, generative models and
discriminative models are trained separately and thus could not adapt to any
changes in each other. As a result, the generated samples can easily deviate
from the real data distribution, while the improvement of the discriminative
model quickly reaches saturation. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) train
generative models via an adversarial process with discriminative models to
achieve joint training. However, the training of standard GANs is notoriously
unstable and often falls short of convergence. In this paper, to address these
issues, we propose a $\textit{self-consistent learning}$ framework, in which a
discriminator and a generator are cooperatively trained in a closed-loop form.
The discriminator and the generator enhance each other during multiple rounds
of alternating training until a scoring consensus is reached. This framework
proves to be easy to train and free from instabilities such as mode collapse
and non-convergence. Extensive experiments on sentence semantic matching

health constructs are dependent on subjective responses, and without such
responses, researchers are left with little to no ground truth to accompany our
ever-growing biobehavioral data. We examine the factors that affect
participants' responsiveness to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) in a 10
day wearable and EMA based affect sensing mHealth study. We study the
physiological relationships indicative of receptivity and affect while also
analyzing the interaction between the two constructs. We collected the data
from 45 healthy participants wearing two devices measuring electrodermal
activity, acceleration, electrocardiography, and skin temperature while
answering 10 EMAs a day containing questions related to perceived mood. Due to
the nature of our constructs, we can only obtain ground truth measures for both
affect and receptivity during a response. Therefore, we utilized unsupervised
and supervised learning methods to infer affect when a participant did not
respond. Based on our findings we showed that using a receptivity model to
trigger EMAs will decrease the reported negative affect by more than 3 points
or 0.29 standard deviation using our psychological instrument scored between 13

during nonresponses. Our results showed a clear relationship between affect and
receptivity. This relationship can affect the efficacy of a mHealth study,
particularly those studies that employ a learning algorithm to trigger EMAs.
Therefore, we propose a smart trigger that promotes EMA and JITI receptivity

the development of various Trojan attacks. The danger posed by Trojan attacks
inserted in SSL encoders lies in their ability to operate covertly and spread

making it even more difficult to detect and mitigate the threat. Although
current Trojan detection methods in supervised learning can potentially
safeguard SSL downstream classifiers, identifying and addressing triggers in

is because downstream tasks are not always known, dataset labels are not

second teacher-student model learns to 'Focus on Your Target' while the first

  Mining, 2023 (Extended version)",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Suppose there is a spreading process such as an infectious disease
propagating on a graph. How would we reduce the number of affected nodes in the
spreading process? This question appears in recent studies about implementing
mobility interventions on mobility networks (Chang et al. (2021)). A practical
algorithm to reduce infections on unweighted graphs is to remove edges with the
highest edge centrality score (Tong et al. (2012)), which is the product of two
adjacent nodes' eigenscores. However, mobility networks have weighted edges;
Thus, an intervention measure would involve edge-weight reduction besides edge
removal. Motivated by this example, we revisit the problem of minimizing top
eigenvalue(s) on weighted graphs by decreasing edge weights up to a fixed
budget. We observe that the edge centrality score of Tong et al. (2012) is
equal to the gradient of the largest eigenvalue of $WW^{\top}$, where $W$
denotes the weight matrix of the graph. We then present generalized edge
centrality scores as the gradient of the sum of the largest $r$ eigenvalues of
$WW^{\top}$. With this generalization, we design an iterative algorithm to find
the optimal edge-weight reduction to shrink the largest $r$ eigenvalues of
$WW^{\top}$ under a given edge-weight reduction budget. We also extend our
algorithm and its guarantee to time-varying graphs, whose weights evolve over
time. We perform a detailed empirical study to validate our approach. Our
algorithm significantly reduces the number of infections compared with existing
methods on eleven weighted networks. Further, we illustrate several properties
of our algorithm, including the benefit of choosing the rank $r$, fast
convergence to global optimum, and an almost linear runtime per iteration.

with promising outcomes. Computational modeling provides a framework for
quantitatively describing BHVs in the preclinical phase. To obtain reliable
solutions in computational modeling, it is essential to consider accurate
leaflet properties such as mechanical properties and density. Bovine
pericardium (BP) is widely used as BHV leaflets. Previous computational studies
assume BP density to be close to the density of water or blood. However, BP
leaflets undergo multiple treatments such as fixation and anti-calcification.
The present study aims to measure the density of the BP used in BHVs and
determine its effect on leaflet stress distribution.
  Methods: We determined the density of eight square BP samples laser cut from
Edwards BP patches. The weight of specimens was measured using an A&D
Analytical Balance, and volume was measured by high-resolution imaging. Finite
element models of a BHV similar to PERIMOUNT Magna were developed in ABAQUS.
  Results: The average density value of the BP samples was 1410 kg/m3. In the
acceleration phase of a cardiac cycle, the maximum stress value reached 1.89
MPa for a density value of 1410 kg/m3 , and 2.47 MPa for a density of 1000
kg/m3(30.7% difference). In the deceleration, the maximum stress value reached
713 and 669 kPa, respectively.
  Conclusion: Stress distribution and deformation of BHV leaflets are dependent
upon the magnitude of density. Ascertaining an accurate value for the density
of BHV leaflets is essential for computational models.

adversarial attacks attract tremendous attention as they can identify the
weaknesses of deep learning models in a black-box manner. An effective strategy
to improve the transferability of adversarial examples is attacking an ensemble
of models. However, previous works simply average the outputs of different
models, lacking an in-depth analysis on how and why model ensemble can strongly
improve the transferability. In this work, we rethink the ensemble in
adversarial attacks and define the common weakness of model ensemble with the
properties of the flatness of loss landscape and the closeness to the local
optimum of each model. We empirically and theoretically show that these two
properties are strongly correlated with the transferability and propose a
Common Weakness Attack (CWA) to generate more transferable adversarial examples
by promoting these two properties. Experimental results on both image
classification and object detection tasks validate the effectiveness of our
approach to improve the adversarial transferability, especially when attacking
adversarially trained models.

RoboChart supports shared variables and communication across entities in its

semantic technique of Interaction Trees (ITrees) represents behaviours of
reactive and concurrent programs interacting with their environments. Recent
mechanisation of ITrees, along with ITree-based CSP semantics and a Z
mathematical toolkit in Isabelle/HOL, bring new applications of verification

paper, we use ITrees to give RoboChart novel operational semantics, implement
it in Isabelle, and use Isabelle's code generator to generate verified and
executable animations. We illustrate our approach using an autonomous chemical
detector model and a patrol robot model additionally exhibiting nondeterminism
and using shared variables. With animation, we show two concrete scenarios for
the chemical detector when the robot encounters different environmental inputs
and three concrete scenarios for the patrol robot when its calibrated position
is in different sections of a corridor. We also verify that the animated
scenarios are truly trace refinements of the CSP denotational semantics of the
RoboChart models using FDR, a refinement model checker for CSP. This supports
the soundness of our approach that the use of CSP operators with priority
resolves nondeterminism correctly.

which does not capture network congestion resulting from high block production

we identify the resilience of PoW NC for a given block production rate. In PoS,
we augment our attack with equivocations to further increase congestion, making
the vanilla PoS NC protocol insecure against any adversarial power except at
very low block production rates. To counter equivocation spamming in PoS, we
present a new NC-style protocol Sanitizing PoS (SaPoS) which achieves the same

fields generate ultra-sparse black-hole solutions. The latter are black holes
that can be potentially of very low density since, contrary to ultra-compact
ones, their horizon radius is always greater than the horizon radius of the
corresponding Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. Then, we generalize
the above static solutions to slowly rotating ones and compute their angular

Simultaneously, the LDM eliminates the linguistic confounder caused by salient

connectivity measures from diffusion MRI tractography, without considering the
shape of the connections reconstructed by tractography. In this paper, we
investigate the potential of fiber tract shape features for predicting
non-imaging phenotypes, both individually and in combination with traditional
features. We focus on three basic shape features: length, diameter, and
elongation. Two different prediction methods are used, including a traditional
regression method and a deep-learning-based prediction method. Experiments use
an efficient two-stage fusion strategy for prediction using microstructure,
connectivity, and shape measures. To reduce predictive bias due to brain size,
normalized shape features are also investigated. Experimental results on the
Human Connectome Project (HCP) young adult dataset (n=1065) demonstrate that
individual shape features are predictive of non-imaging phenotypes. When
combined with microstructure and connectivity features, shape features
significantly improve performance for predicting the cognitive score TPVT (NIH
Toolbox picture vocabulary test). Overall, this study demonstrates that the
shape of fiber tracts contains useful information for the description and study
of the living human brain using machine learning.

to the distribution given by a finite product of some explicit measures that
resemble Cohen--Lenstra measures. For example, the random matrix $X_{n}$ can be
taken as a Haar-random matrix or a uniformly random $(0,1)$-matrix. We consider
the distribution of $\mathrm{cok}(P(X_{n}))$ as a distribution of modules over
$\mathbb{Z}_{p}[t]/(P(t))$, which gives us a clearer formulation in comparison
to considering the distribution as that of abelian groups. For the proof, we
first reduce our problem into a problem over $\mathbb{Z}/p^{k}\mathbb{Z}$, for
large enough positive integer $k$, in place of $\mathbb{Z}_{p}$. Then we use a
result of Sawin and Wood to reduce our problem into another problem of
computing the limit of the expected number of surjective

also enable the use of a vectorial distance, thus preventing the severe

organization, by a project, and by a module within the software project. This
makes recognition of in-domain vs out-of-domain data at the time of deployment
trivial. We establish that samples from each new domain present both models

established methods can adapt models to better generalize to new domains. Our
experiments show that while multitask learning alone is a reasonable baseline,
combining it with few-shot finetuning on examples retrieved from training data
can achieve very strong performance. In fact, according to our experiments,
this solution can outperform direct finetuning for very low-data scenarios.
Finally, we consider variations of this approach to create a more broadly
applicable method to adapt to multiple domains at once. We find that in the
case of code generation, a model adapted to multiple domains simultaneously
performs on par with those adapted to each domain individually.

the NISP and the VIS. The NISP (Near Infrared Spectro-Photometer) is operating
in the near-IR spectral range (0.9-2$\mu$m) with two observing modes: the
photometric mode for the acquisition of images with broad band filters, and the
spectroscopic mode for the acquisition of slitless dispersed images on the
detectors. The spectroscopic mode uses four low resolution grisms to cover two
spectral ranges: three ''red'' grisms for 1250-1850nm range, with three
different orientations, and one ''blue'' grism for 920- 1300nm range. The NISP
grisms are complex optical components combining four main optical functions: a
grism function (dispersion without beam deviation of the first diffracted
order) done by the grating on the prism hypotenuse, a spectral filter done by a
multilayer filter deposited on the first face of the prism to select the
spectral bandpass, a focus function done by the curved filter face of the prism
(curvature radius of 10m) and a spectral wavefront correction done by the
grating which grooves paths are nor parallel, neither straight. The development
of these components have been started since 10 years at the Laboratoire
d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM) and was linked to the project phases:
prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the feasibility, then engineering
and qualification models to validate the optical and mechanical performance of
the component, finally the flight models have been manufactured and tested and
will be installed on NISP instrument. In this paper, we present the optical
performance of the four EUCLID NISP grisms flight models characterized at LAM:
wavefront error, spectral transmission and grating groove profiles. The test
devices and the methods developed for the characterization of these specific
optical components are described. The analysis of the test results have shown
that the grisms flight models for NISP are within specifications with an
efficiency better than 70% on the spectral bandpass and a wavefront error on
surfaces better than 30nm RMS. The components have withstood vibration

algorithms. At pre-processing time, our method computes a medial axis for the
freespace. A reference trajectory is then computed and projected onto the
medial axis for each agent. During run time, when an agent senses other agents
moving in the opposite direction, our algorithm uses the medial axis to
estimate a Point of Impact (POI) as well as the available area around the POI.
If the area around the POI is not large enough for yielding behaviors to be
successful, we shift the POI to nearby large areas by modulating the agent's
reference trajectory and traveling speed. We evaluate our method on a row of 4

using the concepts of the relative survival ratio and the net survival. In
making inference of those measures, external life tables of the general
population are utilized to adjust the impact of non-cancer death on overall
survival. The validity of this adjustment relies on the assumption that
mortality in the external life table approximates non-cancer mortality of
cancer patients. However, the population used to calculate a life table may
include cancer death and cancer patients. Sensitivity analysis proposed by
Talb\""{a}ck and Dickman to address it requires additional information which is

in the proof of the weak maximum principle in the literature does not hold for
this dual problem. To overcome this difficulty, we have decomposed the solution
into a smooth part and a nonsmooth part, and estimated the two parts by $H^2$
and $W^{1,p}$ estimates, respectively.
  As an application of the weak maximum principle, we have proved a
maximum-norm best approximation property of the isoparametric finite element
method for the Poisson equation in a curvilinear polyhedron. The proof contains
non-trivial modifications of Schatz's argument due to the non-conformity of the
iso-parametric finite elements, which requires us to construct a globally
smooth flow map which maps the curvilinear polyhedron to a perturbed larger
domain on which we can establish the $W^{1,\infty}$ regularity estimate of the
Poisson equation uniformly with respect to the perturbation.

``magmas'', especially the property which mainly characterizes them and
distinguishes them from the usual cantorian sets. It is the property of their
elements to {\em depend} on other elements, either in a one-way or a two-way
manner, so that one cannot occur in a collection without the occurrence of
those dependent on it. Such a dependence relation can be represented by a
pre-order relation $\preccurlyeq$ Then, working in a mild strengthening of the
theory ${\rm ZFA}$, where $A$ is an infinite set of atoms equipped with a
primitive pre-ordering $\preccurlyeq$, the class of magmas over $A$ is
represented by the class $LO(A,\preccurlyeq)$ of nonempty open subsets of $A$
with respect to the lower topology of $\langle A,\preccurlyeq\rangle$. Next the
pre-ordering $\preccurlyeq$ is shifted (by a kind of simulation) to a
pre-ordering $\preccurlyeq^+$ on ${\cal P}(A)$, which turns out to satisfy the
same non-minimality condition as well, and which, happily, when restricted to
$LO(A,\preccurlyeq)$ coincides with $\subseteq$. This allows us to define a
hierarchy $M_\alpha(A)$, along all ordinals $\alpha\geq 1$, the``magmatic
hierarchy'', such that $M_1(A)=LO(A,\preccurlyeq)$,
$M_{\alpha+1}(A)=LO(M_\alpha(A),\subseteq)$, and
$M_\alpha(A)=\bigcup_{\beta<\alpha}M_\beta(A)$, for a limit ordinal $\alpha$.
For every $\alpha\geq 1$, $M_\alpha(A)\subseteq V_\alpha(A)$, where
$V_\alpha(A)$ are the levels of the universe $V(A)$ of ${\rm ZFA}$. The class
$M(A)=\bigcup_{\alpha\geq 1}M_\alpha(A)$ is the ``magmatic universe above

super-hydrophobic surfaces, enhanced oil recovery, mining of metal ores and
anti-icing surfaces etc. For rough surfaces, which are the rule rather than the
exception, designing textured surfaces that have wetting properties tailored to
suit these applications generally involves either bio-mimicry or trial and
error. Existing wetting theories such as the well-known Wenzel (1936) and
Cassie & Baxter (1944) models do not predict wetting regimes and importantly,
only give a single equilibrium angle rather than a range of stable contact
angles (hysteresis) as observed in reality. In this paper, we use a
roughness-scale mechanical energy balance (derived in part I) combined with
simulations of micro-scale interface dynamics based on open-source software
(Surface Evolver (Brakke 1992)) to calculate the energy dissipation during the
motion of an interface over a chemically homogeneous rough surface. This
dissipation is used to predict contact angle hysteresis (CAH) from knowledge of
just the surface roughness topography and equilibrium contact angle. We
simulate interface dynamics over a surface decorated with a periodic array of
round-edge square pillars and show that the energy dissipated varies
approximately as ${\phi}ln{\phi}$ with the area fraction (${\phi}$), and
becomes zero as ${\phi} \to 0$. The CAH predicted by our method is in good
agreement with the experimental results of Forsberg et al. (2010), especially
at low area fractions. We also compute CAH for an interface moving at
45${\deg}$ to the surface periodicity direction, showing that the experimental

generate passphrases for practical use. In particular, we address the problem
of generating secure and memorable passphrases and compare them against user

in-use unique English passphrases from prior leaked password databases. Then we
leverage this understanding to create a novel framework for measuring

design MASCARA, which follows a constrained Markov generation process to create

representation with geometric priors (such as depth or surface normal), has led
to impressive progress in the surface reconstruction of large-scale scenes.
However, applying this method to reconstruct a room-level scene from images may
miss structures in low-intensity areas or small and thin objects. We conducted
experiments on three datasets to identify limitations of the original color
rendering loss and priors-embedded SDF scene representation.
  We found that the color rendering loss results in optimization bias against
low-intensity areas, causing gradient vanishing and leaving these areas
unoptimized. To address this issue, we propose a feature-based color rendering
loss that utilizes non-zero feature values to bring back optimization signals.
Additionally, the SDF representation can be influenced by objects along a ray
path, disrupting the monotonic change of SDF values when a single object is
present. To counteract this, we explore using the occupancy representation,
which encodes each point separately and is unaffected by objects along a
querying ray. Our experimental results demonstrate that the joint forces of the
feature-based rendering loss and Occ-SDF hybrid representation scheme can
provide high-quality reconstruction results, especially in challenging

in understanding the reason behind the outputs generated by the neural

behavior of the generalization error in CBM since a neural network is a
singular statistical model in general. When the model is singular, a one to one

non-identifiability makes it difficult to analyze the generalization
performance. In this study, we mathematically clarify the Bayesian
generalization error and free energy of CBM when its architecture is
three-layered linear neural networks. We also consider a multitask problem
where the neural network outputs not only the original output but also the

detecting the averaged DC photocurrent response, we propose that the quantum
fluctuation of photocurrent, in the form of DC shot noise (SN), can also be
heard even when the DC photocurrent is forbidden by symmetry. Particularly, we
develop the quantum theory for DC SN for gapped systems and identify four types
of resonant DC SNs at the second order of electric field, dubbed shift SN,
injection SN, jerk SN and snap SN in terms of their dependence on illumination
time. Importantly, the expressions for all SN susceptibility tensors are also
characterized by the gauge-invariant band topological quantities, such as the
local quantum metric, the local Berry curvature, as well as the shift vector,
and amenable to first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we discuss the
symmetry constraints for all SNs and find that they are hardly forbidden by
symmtry like the photocurrent. To illustrate our theory, we investigate the SNs
in time-reversal-invariant two-dimensional materials GeS and MoS$_2$ with

may exist. All these nuisances may hinder the verification of typical theories
and exposure to new findings. To circumvent them, an alternative is to generate
synthetic data via 3D rendering with domain randomization. We in this work push
forward along this line by doing profound and extensive research on bare
supervised learning and downstream domain adaptation. Specifically, under the
well-controlled, IID data setting enabled by 3D rendering, we systematically
verify the typical, important learning insights, e.g., shortcut learning, and
discover the new laws of various data regimes and network architectures in
generalization. We further investigate the effect of image formation factors on
generalization, e.g., object scale, material texture, illumination, camera
viewpoint, and background in a 3D scene. Moreover, we use the
simulation-to-reality adaptation as a downstream task for comparing the
transferability between synthetic and real data when used for pre-training,
which demonstrates that synthetic data pre-training is also promising to
improve real test results. Lastly, to promote future research, we develop a new

multi-view and multimodal learning, e.g., in representation learning with

line of recent work reveals that contrastive learning can invert the data
generating process and recover ground truth latent factors shared between
views. In this work, we present new identifiability results for multimodal
contrastive learning, showing that it is possible to recover shared factors in
a more general setup than the multi-view setting studied previously.
Specifically, we distinguish between the multi-view setting with one generative
mechanism (e.g., multiple cameras of the same type) and the multimodal setting
that is characterized by distinct mechanisms (e.g., cameras and microphones).
Our work generalizes previous identifiability results by redefining the
generative process in terms of distinct mechanisms with modality-specific
latent variables. We prove that contrastive learning can block-identify latent
factors shared between modalities, even when there are nontrivial dependencies
between factors. We empirically verify our identifiability results with
numerical simulations and corroborate our findings on a complex multimodal
dataset of image/text pairs. Zooming out, our work provides a theoretical basis
for multimodal representation learning and explains in which settings
multimodal contrastive learning can be effective in practice.

stellar magnetic activity or planetary transit selectively varies the weight
and/or shape of profiles at individual surface positions. The effect is usually
modeled with radiative transfer calculations because observations of spatially
resolved stellar surfaces are not available. For the Sun, we recently obtained
a broadband spectroscopic atlas of the solar center-to-limb variation (CLV). We
use the atlas to study systematic differences between largely used radiative
transfer calculations and solar observations. We concentrate on four strong
lines useful for exoplanet transmission analysis, and we investigate the impact
of CLV on transmission and Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) curves. Solar models used
to calculate synthetic spectra tend to underestimate line core depths but
overestimate the effect of CLV. Our study shows that CLV can lead to
significant systematic offsets in transmission curves and particularly in RM
curves; transmission curves centered on individual lines are overestimated by
up to a factor of two by the models, and simulations of RM curves yield
amplitudes that are off by up to 5--10\,m\,s$^{-1}$ depending on the line. For
the interpretation of transit observations, it is crucial for model spectra

resolution of the last convolutional layer, the CAM-based methods can often
only generate coarse-grained visual explanations that provide a coarse location

fine-grained explanations. But the faithfulness of the explanations is too low.
In this paper, we propose FG-CAM (fine-grained CAM), which extends the
CAM-based methods to generate fine-grained visual explanations with high
faithfulness. FG-CAM uses the relationship between two adjacent layers of
feature maps with resolution difference to gradually increase the explanation
resolution, while finding the contributing pixels and filtering out the pixels
that do not contribute at each step. Our method not only solves the shortcoming
of CAM-based methods without changing their characteristics, but also generates
fine-grained explanations that have higher faithfulness than LRP and its
variants. We also present FG-CAM with denoising, which is a variant of FG-CAM
and is able to generate less noisy explanations with almost no change in
explanation faithfulness. Experimental results show that the performance of
FG-CAM is almost unaffected by the explanation resolution. FG-CAM outperforms
existing CAM-based methods significantly in the both shallow and intermediate

enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a
process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS).
However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained
classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training,
resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To
mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional
frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs
heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly
forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world
applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS
model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational
burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a
core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on
known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that
generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the
learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names.
Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve
the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various
datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary

benchmark test results on General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) show
that BBCT can achieve less than 1% accuracy drop in most tasks.

improve the precision of Min-Max. The algorithm has similar complexity to

an ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the positive effect of the

method for topological mapping of unknown environments. It performs task and

recurrent network using the latest image observation sequence to hallucinate a

current and the hallucinated features to generate an action taking the agent
towards that goal. The two planners are jointly trained via deeply-supervised
imitation learning from expert demonstrations. During exploration, we
iteratively call the two planners to predict the next action, and the
topological map is built by constantly appending the latest image observation

closing. The resulting topological map efficiently represents an environment's
connectivity and traversability, so it can be used for tasks such as visual
navigation. We show DeepExplorer's exploration efficiency and strong sim2sim

performance on the resulting topological map. We further show its strong

while ignoring distractor words) is often used to model the planning processes

presence of a distractor (general interference). The size of this effect
depends on the relationship between the target and distractor words.
Distractors of the same semantic category create more interference (semantic
interference), distractors overlapping in phonology create less interference
(phonological facilitation). The present study examines the relationships
between these experimental effects, processing times, and attention in order to
better understand the cognitive processes underlying participants' behavior in
this paradigm. Participants named pictures with a superimposed line of Xs,
semantically related distractors, phonologically related distractors, or
unrelated distractors. General interference, semantic interference, and
phonological facilitation effects are replicated. Distributional analyses
reveal that general and semantic interference effects increase with naming
times, while phonological facilitation decreases. The phonological facilitation
and semantic interference effects are found to depend on the synchronicity in
processing times between the planning of the picture's name and the processing
of the distractor word. Finally, EEG power in the alpha band before stimulus
onset varied with the position of the trial in the experiment and with
repetition but did not predict the size of interference or facilitation
effects. Taken together, these results suggest that experimental effects in the

coupling, AB phase $\phi=\pi/2$, and few higher-order quantum interference
patterns or harmonics are present. We find that the presence of higher
harmonics is necessary but not sufficient to achieve optimal power output. The
maximal constructive interference represented by three close-packed resonance
peaks of the unit transmission can enhance the power output
($P_{max}\approx2.35$ $\mathrm{fW}$) almost 3.5 times as compared to the case

It is easy to order candidates who have the same background, yet it can be
challenging to compare them otherwise. The latter case requires additional

assigned budget, what would be an optimal strategy to select the most qualified
candidate? We model the above problem by introducing a new variant of the
secretary problem in which sequentially observed candidates are split into two
distinct groups. For each new candidate, the decision maker observes its rank
among already seen candidates from the same group and can access its rank among
all observed candidates at some fixed cost. To tackle this new problem, we
introduce and study the family of Dynamic Double Threshold (DDT) algorithms. We
show that, with well-chosen parameters, their success probability converges
rapidly to 1/e as the budget grows, recovering the optimal success probability
from the usual secretary problem. Finally, focusing on the class of memory-less
algorithms, we propose an optimal algorithm in the non-asymptotic regime and
show that it belongs to the DDT family when the number of candidates is large.

the form factor approach based on algebraic Bethe ansatz theory to calculate
precisely the DSF of Lieb-Liniger model with an arbitrary interaction strength

In all the cases, stable perfect synchronization is achieved at a targeted

generates training samples by sampling points in two point clouds with a mixing

those of the equivalent SM process but also distributions in several
kinematical observables that are very different from the SM, both of which can
help disentangle the SM from the 2HDM hypothesis. This difference is a
consequence of the bottom-gluon fusion sub-process, which in the 2HDM becomes
dominant over all others, with the latter remaining very close to the SM
yields. We prove that this phenomenology would be observable at the HL-LHC for
the illustrative example of $h$ to bottom-antibottom quark decays.

attention, with few investigations into their fundamental physics and practical
applications. In this work, 51 magnetic electrides (12 antiferromagnetic, 13
ferromagnetic, and 26 interstitial-magnetic) were identified using
high-throughput computational screening methods and the latest Material Project
database. Based on their compositions, these magnetic electrides can be
classified as magnetic semiconductors, metals, or half-metals, each with unique
topological states and excellent catalytic performance for N2 fixation due to
their low work functions and excess electrons. The novel properties of magnetic
electrides suggest potential applications in spintronics, topological
electronics, electron emission, and as high-performance catalysts. This work

employs a lightweight network as the student model for fast inference. However,
the lightweight student model lacks adequate representation capacity for
effective knowledge imitation during the most critical early training period,
causing final performance degeneration. To tackle this issue, we propose a
Capacity Dynamic Distillation framework, which constructs a student model with
editable representation capacity. Specifically, the employed student model is
initially a heavy model to fruitfully learn distilled knowledge in the early
training epochs, and the student model is gradually compressed during the
training. To dynamically adjust the model capacity, our dynamic framework
inserts a learnable convolutional layer within each residual block in the
student model as the channel importance indicator. The indicator is optimized
simultaneously by the image retrieval loss and the compression loss, and a
retrieval-guided gradient resetting mechanism is proposed to release the
gradient conflict. Extensive experiments show that our method has superior
inference speed and accuracy, e.g., on the VeRi-776 dataset, given the
ResNet101 as a teacher, our method saves 67.13% model parameters and 65.67%

scientific strategies and methods for the effective management of telescope

pulsars. We have also developed an imaging pipeline sensitive to the order of a
few tens of micro-Jansky and a spatial resolution of a few arcseconds. Further
science operations are about to commence with an S-Band receiver system built

  Fluid Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Accurately segmenting fluid in 3D volumetric optical coherence tomography
(OCT) images is a crucial yet challenging task for detecting eye diseases.
Traditional autoencoding-based segmentation approaches have limitations in
extracting fluid regions due to successive resolution loss in the encoding
phase and the inability to recover lost information in the decoding phase.
Although current transformer-based models for medical image segmentation
addresses this limitation, they are not designed to be applied out-of-the-box
for 3D OCT volumes, which have a wide-ranging channel-axis size based on
different vendor device and extraction technique. To address these issues, we
propose SwinVFTR, a new transformer-based architecture designed for precise
fluid segmentation in 3D volumetric OCT images. We first utilize a channel-wise
volumetric sampling for training on OCT volumes with varying depths (B-scans).
Next, the model uses a novel shifted window transformer block in the encoder to
achieve better localization and segmentation of fluid regions. Additionally, we
propose a new volumetric attention block for spatial and depth-wise attention,
which improves upon traditional residual skip connections. Consequently,
utilizing multi-class dice loss, the proposed architecture outperforms other
existing architectures on the three publicly available vendor-specific OCT
datasets, namely Spectralis, Cirrus, and Topcon, with mean dice scores of 0.72,
0.59, and 0.68, respectively. Additionally, SwinVFTR outperforms other
architectures in two additional relevant metrics, mean intersection-over-union

captures shape population trends and allows for patient-specific predictions

deep implicit shape representations with an atlas deforming according to

the pediatric upper airway. Our experiments demonstrate that NAISR achieves
competitive shape reconstruction performance while retaining interpretability.

create strongly nonclassical multipartite correlations with a single unitary
generated by the natural interactions? How does the two-body restriction
influence the time required for that? We answer these questions by studying the
unitary evolutions of quantum states that are generated by Hamiltonians with
two-body interactions. Our main focus is on the fastest generation of
multipartite entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ), W, Dicke and
absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states for up to seven qubits. These
results are obtained by constraining the energy in the system and accordingly
can be seen as state-dependent quantum speed limits for natural interactions.
They give rise to a counter-intuitive effect where the creation of particular
entangled states with an increasing number of particles does not require more

the idea that the optical spectrum is formed in the transition region between
the cool, geometrically thin part of the disc near the mid-plane and a hot,
vertically extended atmosphere or outflow produced by X-ray irradiation. We
first present a VLT X-Shooter spectrum of XRB MAXI J1820+070 in the soft state
associated with its 2018 outburst, which displays a rich set of double-peaked
hydrogen and helium recombination lines. Aided by ancillary X-ray spectra and
reddening estimates, we then model this spectrum with the Monte Carlo radiative
transfer code Python, using a simple biconical disc wind model inspired by
radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of irradiation-driven outflows from XRB
discs. Such a model can qualitatively reproduce the observed features; nearly
all of the optical emission arising from the transonic 'transition region' near
the base of the wind. In this region, characteristic electron densities are on
the order of 10$^{12-13}$ cm$^{-3}$, in line with the observed flat Balmer
decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta \approx 1.3$). We conclude that strong irradiation
can naturally give rise to both the optical line-forming layer in XRB discs and
an overlying outflow/atmosphere that produces X-ray absorption lines.

interpretation of the experimental data was supported by the Anderson impurity

due to the interaction between $5f$ electrons as well as the interaction with
the core hole. The sensitivity of the branching ratio of the Am $4d_{3/2}$ and
$4d_{5/2}$ x-ray absorption lines to the chemical state of Am was shown using
Am binary oxides as reference systems. The observed ratio for Am-doped UO$_2$
suggests that at least at low Am concentrations, americium is in the Am(III)
state in the UO$_2$ lattice. To confirm the validity of the applied AIM
approach, the analysis of the Am $4f$ x-ray photoelectron spectra of AmO$_2$

refine the occupancy learning in TSDF volume. Besides, we find that this
cross-dimensional feature refinement methodology can also be adopted for the

studies utilizing CLIP for object detection have shown that a two-stage
detector design typically outperforms a one-stage detector, while requiring
more expensive training resources and longer inference time. In this work, we
propose a one-stage detector GridCLIP that narrows its performance gap to those
of two-stage detectors, with approximately 43 and 5 times faster than its
two-stage counterpart (ViLD) in the training and test process respectively.
GridCLIP learns grid-level representations to adapt to the intrinsic principle
of one-stage detection learning by expanding the conventional CLIP image-text
holistic mapping to a more fine-grained, grid-text alignment. This differs from
the region-text mapping in two-stage detectors that apply CLIP directly by
treating regions as images. Specifically, GridCLIP performs Grid-level
Alignment to adapt the CLIP image-level representations to grid-level
representations by aligning to CLIP category representations to learn the
annotated (especially frequent) categories. To learn generalizable visual
representations of broader categories, especially undersampled ones, we perform
Image-level Alignment during training to propagate broad pre-learned categories
in the CLIP image encoder from the image-level to the grid-level
representations. Experiments show that the learned CLIP-based grid-level
representations boost the performance of undersampled (infrequent and novel)
categories, reaching comparable detection performance on the LVIS benchmark.

is to translate the graphical model (e.g., BPMN) into program code called smart
contract that can be executed in the blockchain environment. In this context, a
proper smart contract plays a vital role in the correct implementation of
block-chain-based IOPC. In fact, the quality of graphical model affects the
smart con-tract generation. Problematic models (e.g., deadlock) will result in
incorrect contracts (causing unexpected behaviours). To avoid this undesired
implementation, this paper explores to generate smart contracts by using the
verified formal model as input instead of graphical model. Specifically, we
introduce a prototype framework that supports the automatic generation of smart
contracts, providing an end-to-end solution from modeling, verification,
translation to implementation. One of the cores of this framework is to provide
a CSP#-based formalization for the BPMN collaboration model from the
perspective of message interaction. This formalization provides precise
execution semantics and model verification for graphical models, and a verified
formal model for smart contract generation. Another novelty is that it
introduces a syntax tree-based translation algorithm to directly map the formal
model into a smart contract. The required formalism, verification and
translation techniques are transparent to users without imposing additional
burdens. Finally, a set of experiments shows the effectiveness of the
framework.

model. The elastoviscoplastic (EVP) wake flow is studied at a moderate Reynolds
number (Re = 100) where two-dimensional vortex shedding occurs in the Newtonian
case. We find that in the shear-thinning elastoviscoplastic flow, when yield
stress increases, the drag coefficient and root mean square of the lift
coefficient both decrease, while the length of the recirculation bubble
$L_{RB}$ increases. These changes indicate that the wake oscillation amplitude
decreases with an increasing yield stress. For shear-thickening however, the
drag coefficient $C_D$ increases at a large Bingham number, and the wake
becomes chaotic. The comparison of viscoelastic fluid and EVP fluid reveals
that the polymer stresses, tr($\tau^p$), decay considerably less downstream of
the cylinder in the EVP case, indicating that significant stresses persist at
large distances. We observe that shear-thinning competes with elastic and yield
stresses and counteracts their effect, while shear-thickening enhances elastic

pre-trained language model like BERT. However, all samples must go through all
consecutive layers before early exiting and more complex samples usually go
through more layers, which still exists redundant computation. In this paper,
we propose a novel dynamic early exiting combined with layer skipping for BERT
inference named SmartBERT, which adds a skipping gate and an exiting operator
into each layer of BERT. SmartBERT can adaptively skip some layers and
adaptively choose whether to exit. Besides, we propose cross-layer contrastive
learning and combine it into our training phases to boost the intermediate
layers and classifiers which would be beneficial for early exiting. To keep the
consistent usage of skipping gates between training and inference phases, we
propose a hard weight mechanism during training phase. We conduct experiments
on eight classification datasets of the GLUE benchmark. Experimental results
show that SmartBERT achieves 2-3x computation reduction with minimal accuracy
drops compared with BERT and our method outperforms previous methods in both
efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, in some complex datasets like RTE and WNLI,
we prove that the early exiting based on entropy hardly works, and the skipping
mechanism is essential for reducing computation.

leads to undesirable artifacts (mainly written words and unrelated visual

filtering linguistic information at different granular levels, we analyse the

SpectralCLIP, which implements a spectral filtering layer on top of the CLIP

MARCO algorithm which enumerates all minimal explanations.
  Finally, we study the obtained explanations from a range of use cases,

that in several cases, there are more than 100,000 minimal explanations to
choose from for a single prediction. In these cases, we see that only a small

the capability of an arbitrary DNN model for uncertainty modeling. QuanTraffic
requires little human involvement and does not change the base DNN architecture

develops an adaptive scheme that dynamically adjusts the prediction interval
based on the location and prediction window of the test input. We evaluated
QuanTraffic by applying it to five representative DNN models for traffic
forecasting across seven public datasets. We then compared QuanTraffic against
five uncertainty quantification methods. Compared to the baseline uncertainty
modeling techniques, QuanTraffic with base DNN architectures delivers
consistently better and more robust performance than the existing ones on the

velocity potential on the free water surface are introduced in the framework,
which are shown to be a new pair of canonical variables. Using the two
envelopes as the main unknowns, coupled envelope evolution equations (CEEEs)
are derived based on a perturbation expansion. Similar to the High Order
Spectral method, the CEEEs can be derived up to arbitrary order in wave
steepness. In contrast, they have a temporal scale as slow as the rate of
change of a wave spectrum and allow for the wave fields prescribed on a
computational (spatial) domain with a much larger size and with spacing longer
than the characteristic wavelength at no expense of accuracy and numerical
efficiency. The energy balance equation is derived based on the CEEEs. The
nonlinear terms in the CEEEs are in a form of the separation of wave harmonics,
due to which an individual term is shown to have clear physical meanings in
terms of whether or not it is able to force free waves which obey the
dispersion relation. Both the nonlinear terms that can only lead to the forcing
of bound waves and these which are capable of forcing free waves are
demonstrated, with the latter through the analysis of the quartet and quintet
resonant interactions of linear waves. The relations between the CEEEs and two
other existing theoretical frameworks are established, including the theory for
a train of Stokes waves up to second order in wave steepness [Fenton, J.

angle-resolved photoemission. In this Paper, we report on a systematic
investigation of the dynamics of spin polarization and spin-polarized currents
produced by femtosecond laser pulses, modeled within our theoretical framework
EVOLVE. The spin polarization depends strongly on the properties of the laser
pulse and on the sample composition, as is shown by comparing results for
Cu(100), Co(100), and a Co/Cu heterostructure. We find a transition from
coherence before the laser pulse's maximum to incoherence thereafter. Moreover,
the time dependence of the spin-polarization components induced by spin-orbit
coupling differ significantly in Cu and Co: in Cu, we find long-period
oscillations with tiny rapid modulations, whereas in Co prominent rapid
oscillations with long period ones are superimposed. The pronounced spatial
dependencies of the signals underline the importance of inhomogeneities, in
particular magnetic/non-magnetic interfaces `act as source' for ultrafast
spin-polarization effects. Our investigation provides detailed insight into
electron dynamics during and shortly after a femtosecond laser excitation.

propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error

counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that
diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion
model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a
bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way
to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for
detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various
perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated
benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the
performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on
our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over

collective fashion using ``group counterfactuals'' (e.g., to highlight a
repeating pattern of illness in a group of patients). These group
counterfactuals meet a human preference for coherent, broad explanations
covering multiple events/instances. A novel, group-counterfactual algorithm is
proposed to generate high-coverage explanations that are faithful to the

Employing layer-selective Kerr magnetometry and ferromagnetic-resonance
techniques in a complementary manner enables us to distinguish between three
functionally distinct regimes of such ferromagnetic interlayer coupling. The F
layers are found to be individually and independently exchange-biased for thick
FeMn spacers - the first regime of no interlayer F-F* coupling. F-F* coupling
appears on decreasing the FeMn thickness below 9 nm. In this second regime
found in structures with 6.0-9.0 nm thick FeMn spacers, the interlayer coupling
exists only in a finite temperature interval just below the effective N\'eel
temperature of the spacer, which is due to magnon-mediated exchange through the
thermally softened antiferromagnetic spacer, vanishing at lower temperatures.
The third regime, with FeMn thinner than 4 nm, is characterized by a much
stronger interlayer coupling in the entire temperature interval, which is
attributed to a magnetic-proximity induced ferromagnetic exchange. These
experimental results, spanning the key geometrical parameters and thermal
regimes of the F*/AF/F nanostructure, complemented by a comprehensive

exchange in magnetic multilayers and potentially be useful for applications in

an abundance of hairpin-like vortex structures, oriented in a similar
direction, in the turbulent patches of a stably stratified Ekman flow. The
Ekman flow over a smooth wall is a simplified configuration of the Atmospheric
Boundary Layer (ABL) where effects of both stratification and rotation are
present. In this study, hairpin-like structures are investigated by treating
them as slender vortex filaments, i.e., a vortex filament whose diameter $d$ is
small when compared to its radius of curvature $R$. The corrected thin-tube
model of Klein and Knio [J. Fluid Mech. (1995)] is used to compute the motion
of these filaments with the ABL as a background flow. The influence of the mean
background flow on the filaments is studied for two stably stratified cases and
a neutrally stratified case. Our results suggest that the orientation of the
hairpin filament in the spanwise direction is linked to its initial starting
height under stable stratification whereas no such dependency can be observed
with the neutrally stratified background flow. An improved feature tracking
scheme based on spatial overlap for tracking $Q$-criterion vortex structures on
the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) data is also developed. It overcomes the
limitation of using a constant threshold in time by dynamically adjusting the
thresholds to accommodate the growth or deterioration of a feature. A
comparison between the feature tracking and the filament simulation reveals
qualitatively similar temporal developments. Finally, an extension of the
asymptotic analysis of Callegari and Ting [J. App. Math (1978)] is carried out
to include the effect of gravity. The results show that, in the regime
considered here, a contribution from the gravity term occurs only when the tail
of an infinitely long filament is tilted at an angle relative to the wall.

  in Lattice QCD","7 pages, 5 figures",,,,"hep-lat","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a lattice calculation of the entropy density $s/T^{3}$ and speed
of sound $c_{s}^{2}$ of gluedynamics near the critical temperature, $T_{c}$, in
the deconfined phase. By exploring the temperature dependence of entropy
density in this region, we aim to analyse the significant discrepancies between
the previous computations. The calculation of entropy density is carried out by
numerical simulations of $O(a^{4})$ mean-field improved energy-momentum tensor
(EMT) of SU(3) gauge theory on the lattice. We expand on reaching $O(a^{4})$
improvement using tadpole-improved Symanzik action. The entropy density is
calculated directly from the expectation value of the space-time component of
the improved EMT in the presence of shifted boundary conditions at several
lattice spacings ($a \approx 0.043 - 0.012$ fm). The absence of ultraviolet
divergences and the minimal finite-size effects allow for the precision
determination of the entropy density and its extrapolation to the continuum
limit. As expected, the resulting entropy density displays the expected
behaviour of rapid increase near the critical temperature in the deconfined
phase followed by a slow increase in $2T_{c}\leq T\leq 3T_{c}$ region,
suggesting a logarithmic dependence on the temperature. A quantitative
comparison of $s/T^{3}$ shows good agreement with Pade approximation and
lattice results of previous high-precision data obtained using the gradient
flow method. We observe that at temperatures of about $3T_{c}$, deviations of
entropy density from the Stefan-Boltzmann value for a free theory are about
10$\%$. It is shown that the speed of sound in SU(3) gluedynamics is found to
be $c_{s}^{2}\leq 0.333$ in the temperature region $1.06T_{c}\leq T\leq
3.05T_{c}$ explored in this study. The results are found to agree with the
corresponding analytic and numerical estimates.

It is common for massive stars to engage in binary interaction. In
close binaries, the components can enter a contact phase, where both stars
overflow their respective Roche lobes simultaneously. While there exist
observational constraints on the stellar properties of such systems, the most
detailed stellar evolution models that feature a contact phase are not fully
reconcilable with those measurements. Aims. We aim to consistently model
contact phases of binary stars in a 1D stellar evolution code. To this end, we
develop the methodology to account for energy transfer in the common contact
layers. Methods. We implement an approximative model for energy transfer
between the components of a contact binary based on the von Zeipel theorem in
the stellar evolution code MESA. We compare structure and evolution models with
and without this transfer and analyze the implications for the observable
properties of the contact phase. Results. Implementing energy transfer helps
eliminating baroclinicity in the common envelope between the components of a
contact binary, which, if present, would drive strong thermal flows. We find
that accounting for energy transfer in massive contact binaries significantly
alters the mass ratio evolution and can extend the lifetime of an unequal mass

methods to detect concept drift or to adjust models in the presence of observed

fashion, has hardly been considered so far. This problem is of importance since
it enables an inspection of the most prominent characteristics of how and where

detecting variations of the stellar velocity caused by an unseen sub-stellar
companion. Instrumental errors, irregular time sampling, and different noise
sources originating in the intrinsic variability of the star can hinder the
interpretation of the data, and even lead to spurious detections. In recent
times, work began to emerge in the field of extrasolar planets that use Machine
Learning algorithms, some with results that exceed those obtained with the
traditional techniques in the field. We seek to explore the scope of the neural
networks in the radial velocity method, in particular for exoplanet detection
in the presence of correlated noise of stellar origin. In this work, a neural
network is proposed to replace the computation of the significance of the
signal detected with the radial velocity method and to classify it as of
planetary origin or not. The algorithm is trained using synthetic data of
systems with and without planetary companions. We injected realistic correlated
noise in the simulations, based on previous studies of the behaviour of stellar
activity. The performance of the network is compared to the traditional method
based on null hypothesis significance testing. The network achieves 28 % fewer
false positives. The improvement is observed mainly in the detection of
small-amplitude signals associated with low-mass planets. In addition, its
execution time is five orders of magnitude faster than the traditional method.
The superior performance exhibited by the algorithm has only been tested on
simulated radial velocity data so far. Although in principle it should be
straightforward to adapt it for use in real time series, its performance has to
be tested thoroughly. Future work should permit evaluating its potential for
adoption as a valuable tool for exoplanet detection.

often intensive medical treatment. For diagnosis, a Cranial Computed Tomography
(CCT) scan is usually performed. However, the increased health risk caused by
radiation is a concern. The most important strategy to reduce this potential
risk is to keep the radiation dose as low as possible and consistent with the
diagnostic task. Sparse-view CT can be an effective strategy to reduce dose by
reducing the total number of views acquired, albeit at the expense of image
quality. In this work, we use a U-Net architecture to reduce artifacts from
sparse-view CCTs, predicting fully sampled reconstructions from sparse-view
ones. We evaluate the hemorrhage detectability in the predicted CCTs with a
hemorrhage classification convolutional neural network, trained on fully
sampled CCTs to detect and classify different sub-types of hemorrhages. Our
results suggest that the automated classification and detection accuracy of
hemorrhages in sparse-view CCTs can be improved substantially by the U-Net.
This demonstrates the feasibility of rapid automated hemorrhage detection on
low-dose CT data to assist radiologists in routine clinical practice.

antimicrobial treatment protocols, using standard pharmacodynamic and
pharmacokinetic mathematical models. We consider the problem of designing an
antimicrobial treatment schedule to achieve eradication of a microbial
infection, while minimizing the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC).
We first solve this problem under the assumption that an arbitrary
antimicrobial concentration profile may be chosen, and prove that the 'ideal'
concentration profile consists of a constant concentration over a finite time
duration, where explicit expressions for the optimal concentration and the time
duration are given in terms of the pharmacodynamic parameters. Since
antimicrobial concentration profiles are induced by a dosing schedule and the
antimicrobial pharmacokinetics, the ideal concentration profile is not strictly
feasible. We therefore also investigate the possibility of achieving outcomes
which are close to those provided by the ideal concentration profile,using a
bolus+continuous dosing schedule, which consists of a loading dose followed by
infusion of the antimicrobial at a constant rate. We explicitly find the
optimal bolus+continuous dosing schedule, and show that, for realistic
parameter ranges, this schedule achieves results which are nearly as efficient
as those attained by the ideal concentration profile. The optimality results
obtained here provide a baseline and reference point for comparison and
evaluation of antimicrobial treatment plans.

Separately, operational models can be given by unfolds, and naturally not all

policies using only offline datasets. This is a particularly difficult setup,
especially when learning to achieve multiple different goals or outcomes under
a given scenario with only sparse rewards. For offline learning of
goal-conditioned policies via supervised learning, previous work has shown that
an advantage weighted log-likelihood loss guarantees monotonic policy
improvement. In this work we argue that, despite its benefits, this approach is
still insufficient to fully address the distribution shift and multi-modality
problems. The latter is particularly severe in long-horizon tasks where finding
a unique and optimal policy that goes from a state to the desired goal is
challenging as there may be multiple and potentially conflicting solutions. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a complementary advantage-based weighting
scheme that introduces an additional source of inductive bias: given a
value-based partitioning of the state space, the contribution of actions
expected to lead to target regions that are easier to reach, compared to the
final goal, is further increased. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed
approach, Dual-Advantage Weighted Offline Goal-conditioned RL (DAWOG),
outperforms several competing offline algorithms in commonly used benchmarks.
Analytically, we offer a guarantee that the learnt policy is never worse than
the underlying behaviour policy.

neutrino detectors, complementary to geophysics methods. The two main
approaches are based on either partial absorption of the neutrino flux as it
propagates through the Earth (at energies about a few TeV) or on coherent Earth
matter effects affecting the neutrino oscillations pattern (at energies below a
few tens of GeV). In this work, we consider the latter approach focusing on
supernova neutrinos with tens of MeV. Whereas at GeV energies, Earth matter
effects are driven by the atmospheric mass-squared difference, at energies
below $\sim 100$~MeV, it is the solar mass-squared difference what controls
them. Unlike solar neutrinos, which suffer from significant weakening of the
contribution to the oscillatory effect from remote structures due to the
neutrino energy reconstruction capabilities of detectors, supernova neutrinos
can have higher energies and thus, can better probe the Earth's interior. We
shall revisit this possibility, using the most recent neutrino oscillation
parameters and up-to-date supernova neutrino spectra. The capabilities of
future neutrino detectors, such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO are
presented, including the impact of the energy resolution and other factors.
Assuming a supernova burst at 10~kpc, we show that the average Earth's core
density could be determined within $\lesssim 10\%$ at $1\sigma$ confidence
level, being Hyper-Kamiokande, with its largest mass, the most promising
detector to achieve this goal.

removal model, termed PSTNet, by exploiting three essential characteristics of
video shadows, i.e., physical property, spatio relation, and temporal
coherence. Specifically, a dedicated physical branch was established to conduct
local illumination estimation, which is more applicable for scenes with complex
lighting and textures, and then enhance the physical features via a mask-guided
attention strategy. Then, we develop a progressive aggregation module to
enhance the spatio and temporal characteristics of features maps, and
effectively integrate the three kinds of features. Furthermore, to tackle the
lack of datasets of paired shadow videos, we synthesize a dataset (SVSRD-85)
with aid of the popular game GTAV by controlling the switch of the shadow
renderer. Experiments against 9 state-of-the-art models, including image shadow
removers and image/video restoration methods, show that our method improves the
best SOTA in terms of RMSE error for the shadow area by 14.7. In addition, we
develop a lightweight model adaptation strategy to make our synthetic-driven
model effective in real world scenes. The visual comparison on the public

\HI\ observations from the MeerKAT large survey project MIGHTEE reveal possible
interaction features, such as extended spiral arms, and the two newly

its companions. We do find an excess of light in the outer parts of the
companion galaxy MGTH$\_$J022138.1-052631 which could be an indication of
external perturbation and thus possible sign of interactions. Our analysis
shows that NGC~895 is an actively star-forming galaxy with a SFR of
$\mathrm{1.75 \pm 0.09 [M_{\odot}/yr]}$, a value typical for high stellar mass
galaxies on the star forming main sequence. It is reasonable to state that

explored domain adaptation (DA) algorithms from various perspectives, including
feature alignment, entropy minimization, contrast synthesis (style transfer),
and pseudo-labeling. This paper introduces a novel framework called MAPSeg

well as masked pseudo-labeling, the model is able to jointly learn from labeled

consistently outperformed other methods, including previous state-of-the-art

Magellanic Cloud (LMC) offers a unique opportunity to resolve a stellar
population in a starburst-like environment. We obtain the near-infrared to
ultraviolet extinction towards 50 stars in the core of R136, employing the
`extinction without standards' method. To assure good fits over the full
wavelength range, we combine and modify existing extinction laws. We detect a
strong spatial gradient in the extinction properties across the core of R136,
coinciding with a gradient in density of cold gas that is part of a molecular
cloud lying northeast of the cluster. In line with previous measurements of
R136 and the 30 Doradus region, we obtain a high total-to-relative extinction
($R_V = 4.38 \pm 0.87$). However, the high values of $R_V$ are accompanied by
relatively strong extinction in the ultraviolet, contrary to what is observed
for Galactic sightlines. The relatively strong ultraviolet extinction suggests
that the properties of the dust towards R136 differ from those in the Milky
Way. For $R_{V} \sim 4.4$, about three times fewer ultraviolet photons can
escape from the ambient dust environment relative to the canonical Galactic
value of $R_{V} \sim 3.1$ at the same $A_{V}$. Therefore, if dust in the R136
star-bursting environment is characteristic for cosmologically distant
star-bursting regions, the escape fraction of ultraviolet photons from such
regions is overestimated by a factor of three relative to the standard Milky
Way assumption for the total-to-selective extinction. Furthermore, a comparison
with average curves tailored to other regions of the LMC shows that large
differences in ultraviolet extinction exist within this galaxy. Further
investigation is required in order to decipher whether or not there is a
relation between $R_V$ and ultraviolet extinction in the LMC.

the blueshifted high-velocity absorption component is generated only during the
egress part of the transit when a larger fraction of the day side of the planet
is visible. For the egress data, MERC retrieves the blueshifted high-velocity
absorption component as an equatorial day-to-night side wind across the evening
limb, with no zonal winds visible on the morning terminator with weak evidence
compared to a model with only vertical winds. For the mid-transit data, the
observed line broadening is attributed to a vertical, radial wind. We attribute
the equatorial day-to-night side wind over the evening terminator to a
localised jet and restrain its existence between the substellar point and up to
$10^\circ$ to the terminator in longitude, an opening angle of the jet of at
most $60^\circ$ in latitude, and a lower boundary in altitude between [1.08,
1.15] $R_p$. Due to the partial nature of the transit, we cannot make any
statements on whether the jet is truly super-rotational and one-sided or part
of a symmetric day-to-night side atmospheric wind from the hotspot.

Though capability restrictions risk reducing use more than misuse (facing an
unfavorable Misuse-Use Tradeoff), we argue that interventions on capabilities

from misuse is high, and there are targeted ways to intervene on capabilities.
We provide a taxonomy of interventions that can reduce AI misuse, focusing on

improving patient-specific treatment plans. In this context, we present our
recent work on simulating non-small-scale cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a simple,
deterministic setting for two different patients receiving an immunotherapeutic
treatment.
  At its core, our model consists of a Cahn-Hilliard-based phase-field model
describing the evolution of proliferative and necrotic tumor cells. These are
coupled to a simplified nutrient model that drives the growth of the
proliferative cells and their decay into necrotic cells. The applied
immunotherapy decreases the proliferative cell concentration. Here, we model
the immunotherapeutic agent concentration in the entire lung over time by an
ordinary differential equation (ODE). Finally, reaction terms provide a
coupling between all these equations. By assuming spherical, symmetric tumor
growth and constant nutrient inflow, we simplify this full 3D cancer simulation
model to a reduced 1D model.
  We can then resort to patient data gathered from computed tomography (CT)
scans over several years to calibrate our model. For the reduced 1D model, we

  already implemented",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  [Abridged] Aim: We aim to derive a new mass-loss rate prescription for RSGs
that is not afflicted with some uncertainties inherent in preceding studies.
Methods: We have observed CO rotational line emission towards a sample of RSGs
in the open cluster RSGC1 that all are of similar initial mass. The ALMA
CO(2-1) line detections allow to retrieve the gas mass-loss rates (Mdot_CO). In
contrast to mass-loss rates derived from the analysis of dust spectral features
(Mdot_SED), the data allow a direct determination of the wind velocity and no
uncertain dust-to-gas correction factor is needed. Results: Five RSGs in RSGC1
have been detected in CO(2-1). The retrieved Mdot_CO values are systematically
lower than Mdot_SED. Although only five RSGs in RSGC1 have been detected, the
data allow to propose a new mass-loss rate relation for M-type red supergiants
that is dependent on luminosity and initial mass. The new mass-loss rate
relation is based on the new Mdot_CO values for the RSGs in RSGC1 and on prior
Mdot_SED values for RSGs in 4 clusters, including RSGC1. The new
Mdot-prescription yields a good prediction for the mass-loss rate of some
well-known Galactic RSGs that are observed in multiple CO rotational lines,
including alpha Ori, mu Cep and VX Sgr. However, there are indications that a
stronger, potentially eruptive, mass-loss process - different than captured by
our new mass-loss rate prescription - is occurring during some fraction of the
RSG lifetime. Implementing a lower mass-loss rate in evolution codes for
massive stars has important consequences for the nature of their end-state. A
reduction of the RSG mass-loss rate implies that quiescent RSG mass loss is not
enough to strip a single star's hydrogen-rich envelope. Upon core-collapse such
single stars would explode as RSG.

clarifies challenges in defining and measuring manipulation in the context of
AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation from other
fields and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we
find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, harm, and covertness.
We review proposals on how to operationalize each factor. Second, we propose a
definition of manipulation based on our characterization: a system is
manipulative \textit{if it acts as if it were pursuing an incentive to change a

connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and
coercion. Finally, we contextualize our operationalization of manipulation in
some applications. Our overall assessment is that while some progress has been

In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we
cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans

poses a significant threat to human autonomy, suggesting that precautionary
actions to mitigate it are warranted.

to the complexity of the certification of autonomous driving systems. As a
response, certification authorities have already started introducing strategies
for the certification of autonomous vehicles and their software. But even with
these new approaches, the certification procedures are not fully catching up
with the dynamism and unpredictability of future autonomous systems, and thus
may not necessarily guarantee compliance with all requirements imposed on these
systems. In this paper, we identified a number of issues with the proposed
certification strategies, which may impact the systems substantially. For
instance, we emphasize the lack of adequate reflection on software changes
occurring in constantly changing systems, or low support for systems'
cooperation needed for the management of coordinated moves. Other shortcomings
concern the narrow focus of the awarded certification by neglecting aspects
such as the ethical behavior of autonomous software systems. The contribution
of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the motivation for the need to
modify the current certification processes for autonomous driving systems.
Second, we analyze current international standards used in the certification
processes towards requirements derived from the requirements laid on dynamic
software ecosystems and autonomous systems themselves. Third, we outline a
concept for incorporating the missing parts into the certification procedure.

is promising for health monitoring. Radio systems at millimeter-wave (mmWave)
frequencies advantageously bring large bandwidth, multi-antenna array and beam
steering capability. \textit{However}, the human point cloud obtained by mmWave
radar and utilized for posture estimation is likely to be sparse and
incomplete. Additionally, human's random body movements deteriorate the
estimation of breathing and heart rates, therefore the information of the chest
location and a narrow radar beam toward the chest are demanded for more
accurate vital sign estimation.
  In this paper, we propose a pipeline aiming to enhance the vital sign
estimation performance of mmWave FMCW MIMO radar. The first step is to
recognize human body part and posture, where we exploit a trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) to efficiently process the imperfect human form point
cloud. The CNN framework outputs the key point of different body parts, and was
trained by using RGB image reference and Augmentative Ellipse Fitting Algorithm
(AEFA). The next step is to utilize the chest information of the prior
estimated human posture for vital sign estimation. While CNN is initially
trained based on the frame-by-frame point clouds of human for posture
estimation, the vital signs are extracted through beamforming toward the human
chest.
  The numerical results show that this spatial filtering improves the
estimation of the vital signs in regard to lowering the level of side harmonics
and detecting the harmonics of vital signs efficiently, i.e., peak-to-average
power ratio in the harmonics of vital signal is improved up to 0.02 and 0.07dB

We use a Centroid Contrasting objective along with single Neighbour Contrasting
and Feature Contrasting objectives. Centroids help in learning contextual
information from multiple neighbours whereas the neighbour contrast enables
learning representations directly from the neighbours and the feature contrast
allows learning representations unique to the features. This combination
enables All4One to outperform popular instance discrimination approaches by
more than 1% on linear classification evaluation for popular benchmark datasets
and obtains state-of-the-art (SoTA) results. Finally, we show that All4One is
robust towards embedding dimensionalities and augmentations, surpassing NNCLR

a particle trajectory is unwrapped from a projection into the central box under
periodic boundary conditions to a trajectory in full three-dimensional space,
e.g., for the calculation of diffusion coefficients. Here, we review and
compare different schemes in use for trajectory unwrapping. We also specify the
corresponding rewrapping schemes to put an unwrapped trajectory back into the

Before the jump, when the cylinder moves along the ramp, we can assume a pure

optics(AO)-assisted observations is still a major limitation when processing AO
data. This limitation is particularly important when image analysis requires
the use of deconvolution methods. As the PSF is a complex and time-varying
function, reference PSFs acquired on calibration stars before or after the
scientific observation can be too different from the actual PSF of the
observation to be used for deconvolution, and lead to artefacts in the final
image. We improved the existing PSF-estimation method based on the so-called
marginal approach by enhancing the object prior in order to make it more robust
and suitable for observations of resolved extended objects. Our process is
based on a two-step blind deconvolution approach from the literature. The first
step consists of PSF estimation from the science image. For this, we made use
of an analytical PSF model, whose parameters are estimated based on a marginal
algorithm. This PSF was then used for deconvolution. In this study, we first
investigated the requirements in terms of PSF parameter knowledge to obtain an
accurate and yet resilient deconvolution process using simulations. We show
that current marginal algorithms do not provide the required level of accuracy,
especially in the presence of small objects. Therefore, we modified the
marginal algorithm by providing a new model for object description, leading to
an improved estimation of the required PSF parameters. Our method fulfills the
deconvolution requirement with realistic system configurations and different
classes of Solar System objects in simulations. Finally, we validate our method
by performing blind deconvolution with SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations of the

Margolus and Levitin derived an equally well-known and ostensibly related

Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit can be similarly extended to closed
systems. However, a recent geometrical examination of this limit reveals that
it differs significantly from most quantum speed limits. In this paper, we show
contrary to the common belief that the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit
does not extend to closed systems in an obvious way. More precisely, we show
that there exist closed systems that evolve between states with any given
fidelity in an arbitrarily short time while keeping the normalized expected
energy fixed at any chosen value. We also show that for isolated systems, the
Mandelstam-Tamm quantum speed limit and a slightly weakened version of this
limit that we call the Bhatia-Davies quantum speed limit always saturate

numerically simulated with matrix product states (MPS). The computational
complexity of MPS methods is known to be related to the growth of entropies of
reduced density matrices for bipartitions of the chain. While for closed
systems the entropy relevant for the complexity is uniquely defined by the
entanglement entropy, for open systems it depends on the choice of the
representation. Here, we systematically compare the growth of different
entropies relevant to the complexity of matrix product representations in
open-system simulations. We simulate an XXZ spin-1/2 chain in the presence of
spontaneous emission/absorption and dephasing. We compare simulations using a
representation of the full density matrix as a matrix product density operator
(MPDO) with a quantum trajectory unravelling, where each trajectory is itself
represented by an MPS (QT+MPS). We show that the bipartite entropy in the MPDO
description (operator entanglement, OE) generally scales more favorable with
time than the entropy in QT+MPS (trajectory entanglement, TE): i) For
spontaneous emission/absorption the OE vanishes while the TE grows and reaches
a constant value for large dissipative rates and sufficiently long times; ii)
for dephasing the OE exhibits only logarithmic growth while the TE grows
polynomially. Although QT+MPS requires a smaller local state space, the more
favorable entropy growth can thus make MPDO simulations fundamentally more
efficient than QT+MPS. Furthermore, MPDO simulations allow for easier
exploitation of higher order Trotter decompositions and translational
invariance, allowing for larger time steps and system sizes.

practical and theoretical adequacy contribution of ES and VES, as well as the
ability to displace generation and physical storage while maintaining
equivalent system adequacy. Exhaustive case studies based on the IEEE RTS-79

integration of IRS imposes a fundamental challenge to frequency-multiplexing
approaches such as frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) and the widely

that (O)FDMA does not need user scheduling when there are a few users. If the

drug discovery. Many traditional and machine-learning based methods are
available to fulfil the docking task. The traditional docking methods are
normally extensively time-consuming, and their performance in blind docking
remains to be improved. Although the runtime of docking based on machine
learning is significantly decreased, their accuracy is still limited. In this
study, we take the advantage of both traditional and machine-learning based
methods, and present a method Deep Site and Docking Pose (DSDP) to improve the
performance of blind docking. For the traditional blind docking, the entire
protein is covered by a cube, and the initial positions of ligands are randomly
generated in the cube. In contract, DSDP can predict the binding site of
proteins and provide an accurate searching space and initial positions for the
further conformational sampling. The docking task of DSDP makes use of the
score function and a similar but modified searching strategy of AutoDock Vina,
accelerated by implementation in GPUs. We systematically compare its
performance with the state-of-the-art methods, including Autodock Vina, GNINA,
QuickVina, SMINA, and DiffDock. DSDP reaches a 29.8% top-1 success rate (RMSD <
2 {\AA}) on an unbiased and challenging test dataset with 1.2 s wall-clock
computational time per system. Its performances on DUD-E dataset and the
time-split PDBBind dataset used in EquiBind, TankBind, and DiffDock are also
effective, presenting a 57.2% and 41.8% top-1 success rate with 0.8 s and 1.0 s

initial conformation is iteratively optimized to its equilibrium conformation,

All these steps are automatically learned using Transformer models. We observed

The best known of these models, the Hodgkin-Huxley model, is an example of this

opening and closing rates of each type of gate present in the channels. These
functions need to be derived from laboratory measurements that are often very

applying Deep Learning methods to estimate these functions. This would result

paratopological gyrogroups. The conclusions are established as follows: (1) A
compact Hausdorff paratopological gyrogroup $G$ is a topological gyrogroup. (2)
A Hausdorff locally compact strongly paratopological gyrogroup is a topological
gyrogroup. (3) If $G$ is locally compact strongly paratopological
gyrocommutative gyrogroup (without any separation restrictions), then $G$ is a
strongly topological gyrogroup. (4) Every regular feebly compact strongly
paratopological gyrogroup is a topological gyrogroup. (5) If a Hausdorff
strongly paratopological gyrogroup $G$ is countablly compact and topologically
periodic, then $G$ is a strongly topological gyrogroup.

  Calculus: A Case Study in Deep Learning for Code","22 pages",,,,"cs.PL cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO cs.SC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite a growing body of work at the intersection of deep learning and
formal languages, there has been relatively little systematic exploration of
transformer models for reasoning about typed lambda calculi. This is an
interesting area of inquiry for two reasons. First, typed lambda calculi are
the lingua franc of programming languages. A set of heuristics that relate
various typed lambda calculi to effective neural architectures would provide a
systematic method for mapping language features (e.g., polymorphism, subtyping,
inheritance, etc.) to architecture choices. Second, transformer models are
widely used in deep learning architectures applied to code, but the design and
hyperparameter space for them is large and relatively unexplored in programming
language applications. Therefore, we suggest a benchmark that allows us to
explore exactly this through perhaps the simplest and most fundamental property
of a programming language: the relationship between terms and types.
Consequently, we begin this inquiry of transformer architectures for typed
lambda calculi by exploring the effect of transformer warm-up and optimizer
selection in the task of type inference: i.e., predicting the types of lambda
calculus terms using only transformers. We find that the optimization landscape
is difficult even in this simple setting. One particular experimental finding
is that optimization by Adafactor converges much faster compared to the
optimization by Adam and RAdam. We conjecture that such different performance
of optimizers might be related to the difficulties of generalization over
formally generated dataset.

wide range of applications in natural language processing, speech recognition
and computer vision. Extending Transformer's success to safety-critical domains
requires calibrated uncertainty estimation which remains under-explored. To
address this, we propose Sparse Gaussian Process attention (SGPA), which
performs Bayesian inference directly in the output space of multi-head
attention blocks (MHAs) in transformer to calibrate its uncertainty. It
replaces the scaled dot-product operation with a valid symmetric kernel and
uses sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) techniques to approximate the posterior
processes of MHA outputs. Empirically, on a suite of prediction tasks on text,
images and graphs, SGPA-based Transformers achieve competitive predictive
accuracy, while noticeably improving both in-distribution calibration and
out-of-distribution robustness and detection.

different clients in an environment with both labeled and unlabeled data. Most
of the existing FSSL work generally assumes that both types of data are
available on each client. In this paper, we study a more general problem setup
of FSSL with annotation heterogeneity, where each client can hold an arbitrary
percentage (0%-100%) of labeled data. To this end, we propose a novel FSSL
framework called Heterogeneously Annotated Semi-Supervised LEarning (HASSLE).
Specifically, it is a dual-model framework with two models trained separately
on labeled and unlabeled data such that it can be simply applied to a client
with an arbitrary labeling percentage. Furthermore, a mutual learning strategy
called Supervised-Unsupervised Mutual Alignment (SUMA) is proposed for the dual
models within HASSLE with global residual alignment and model proximity
alignment. Subsequently, the dual models can implicitly learn from both types
of data across different clients, although each dual model is only trained
locally on a single type of data. Experiments verify that the dual models in
HASSLE learned by SUMA can mutually learn from each other, thereby effectively
utilizing the information of both types of data across different clients.

long been suffering from fragmentary object regions led by Class Activation Map
(CAM), which is incapable of generating fine-grained masks for semantic
segmentation. To guide CAM to find more non-discriminating object patterns,
this paper turns to an interesting working mechanism in agent learning named
Complementary Learning System (CLS). CLS holds that the neocortex builds a
sensation of general knowledge, while the hippocampus specially learns specific
details, completing the learned patterns. Motivated by this simple but
effective learning pattern, we propose a General-Specific Learning Mechanism
(GSLM) to explicitly drive a coarse-grained CAM to a fine-grained pseudo mask.
Specifically, GSLM develops a General Learning Module (GLM) and a Specific
Learning Module (SLM). The GLM is trained with image-level supervision to
extract coarse and general localization representations from CAM. Based on the
general knowledge in the GLM, the SLM progressively exploits the specific
spatial knowledge from the localization representations, expanding the CAM in
an explicit way. To this end, we propose the Seed Reactivation to help SLM
reactivate non-discriminating regions by setting a boundary for activation
values, which successively identifies more regions of CAM. Without extra
refinement processes, our method is able to achieve breakthrough improvements
for CAM of over 20.0% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 10.0% mIoU on MS COCO 2014

phase transition could not only trigger electroweak symmetry breaking but also
initiate the exit from supercooling. To study the dynamics of this scenario, we
focus on low-energy quark-based QCD effective models that exhibit a first-order

thermal inflation ends, we find that a supercooling period prior to the QCD

implies great observational prospects at future gravitational wave

weights instead of real-valued weights. Current BNNs use latent real-valued
weights during training, where several training hyper-parameters are inherited
from real-valued networks. The interpretation of several of these
hyperparameters is based on the magnitude of the real-valued weights. For BNNs,
however, the magnitude of binary weights is not meaningful, and thus it is
unclear what these hyperparameters actually do. One example is weight-decay,
which aims to keep the magnitude of real-valued weights small. Other examples
are latent weight initialization, the learning rate, and learning rate decay,
which influence the magnitude of the real-valued weights. The magnitude is
interpretable for real-valued weights, but loses its meaning for binary
weights. In this paper we offer a new interpretation of these magnitude-based
hyperparameters based on higher-order gradient filtering during network
optimization. Our analysis makes it possible to understand how magnitude-based
hyperparameters influence the training of binary networks which allows for new
optimization filters specifically designed for binary neural networks that are
independent of their real-valued interpretation. Moreover, our improved
understanding reduces the number of hyperparameters, which in turn eases the
hyperparameter tuning effort which may lead to better hyperparameter values for
improved accuracy. Code is available at

point clouds, is a core task in autonomous driving and many other 3D vision
applications. Existing methods either suffer from structure distortion due to
ignorance of rigid motion consistency or require explicit pose estimation and
3D object segmentation. Errors of estimated poses and segmented objects would
yield inaccurate rigidity constraints and in turn mislead scene flow
estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel weight-sharing aggregation (WSA)
method for feature and scene flow up-sampling. WSA does not rely on estimated
poses and segmented objects, and can implicitly enforce rigidity constraints to
avoid structure distortion in scene flow estimation. To further exploit
geometric information and preserve local structure, we design a deformation
degree module aim to keep the local region invariance. We modify the
PointPWC-Net and integrate the proposed WSA and deformation degree module into
the enhanced PointPWC-Net to derive an end-to-end scene flow estimation

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) Universe, in the presence of the
curvature terms. The thermodynamics of open systems as applied together with
the gravitational field equations to the three component cosmological fluid
leads to a generalization of the elementary scalar field-radiation interaction
model, which is the theoretical basis of warm inflationary models. Moreover,
the decay (creation) pressures describing matter production are explicitly
considered as parts of the cosmological fluid energy-momentum tensor. A
specific theoretical model, describing coherently oscillating scalar waves, is
considered. In particular, we investigate the role of the curvature terms in
the dynamical evolution of the early Universe, by considering numerical
solutions of the gravitational field equations. Our results indicate that
despite the fact that the Universe becomes flat at the end of the inflationary
era, the curvature terms, if present, may still play an important role in the
very first stages of the evolution of the Universe.

variational quantum text classifiers (VQTCs), in line with VQSCs. The first is
a weighted bag-of-sentences approach which treats text as a group of

coreference resolution approach which treats text as a consolidation of its

based on the DisCoCat model and should be implementable in lambeq / DisCoCat.
The third approach, on the other hand, is based on the DisCoCirc model which
considers both ordering of sentences and interaction of words in composing text
meaning from word and sentence meanings. DisCoCirc makes fundamental
modification of DisCoCat since a sentence in DisCoCirc updates meanings of
words, whereas all meanings are static in DisCoCat. It is not clear if
DisCoCirc can be implemented in lambeq / DisCoCat without breaking DisCoCat.

perspective of the squared difference between the two expectations. With
extensive experiments on several architectures (CNNs, Transformers) and

model calibration in various batch size settings without the need for internal

previous approaches, and (3) ESD drastically improves the computational costs
required for calibration during training due to the absence of internal

(GASF/GADF) as well as Markov Transition Fields (MTF) to generate three $2D$
matrices from each ECG time series, which when put together, form a $3$-channel

and the generation of \emph{Normal Sinus Beat} ECG signals exclusively, where
the Normal Sinus Beat class from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset is used in the

connectivity. But how is our choice of randomness informed by known network
properties? And how does it affect the network's behavior? Previous approaches
have focused on prescribing increasingly sophisticated statistics of synaptic
strengths and motifs. However, at the same time experimental data on parallel
dynamics of neurons is readily accessible. We therefore propose a complementary
approach, specifying connectivity in the space that directly controls the
dynamics - the space of eigenmodes. We develop a theory for a novel ensemble of
large random matrices, whose eigenvalue distribution can be chosen arbitrarily.
We show analytically how varying such distribution induces a diverse range of
collective network behaviors, including power laws that characterize the
dimensionality, principal components spectrum, autocorrelation, and
autoresponse of neuronal activity. The power-law exponents are controlled by
the density of nearly critical eigenvalues, and provide a minimal and robust
measure to directly link observable dynamics and connectivity. The density of
nearly critical modes also characterizes a transition from high to low
dimensional dynamics, while their maximum oscillation frequency determines a
transition from an exponential to power-law decay in time of the correlation
and response functions. We prove that the wide range of dynamical behaviors
resulting from the proposed connectivity ensemble is caused by structures that
are invisible to a motif analysis. Their presence is captured by motifs
appearing with vanishingly small probability in the number of neurons. Only
reciprocal motifs occur with finite probability. In other words, a motif
analysis can be blind to synaptic structures controlling the dynamics, which
instead become apparent in the space of eigenmode statistics.

Although CKDu has been linked by various authors to farming, it is an artifact
of treating multi-modal disease distributions as unimodal. There is NO
correlation of CKDu with agriculture since affected farming villages are often
surrounded by other farming villages free of CKDu. Initial studies looked for a
correlation of CKDu with toxic heavy metal residues of arsenic, cadmium etc.,
or herbicides like glyphosate that may be present in the environment, as the
causative factors. There is now considerable consensus that their
concentrations are below danger thresholds, be it in Mesoamerica or south-east
Asia. The conceptual basis of a search for etiology within a systems approach
is discussed, and attempts to name the disease to bias the identification of
its etiology are reviewed. Current research has narrowed down the etiology to
geochemical electrolytic contaminants like fluorides and ionic components in
hard water, nanosilica (found in water as well as in the air), as well as renal
toxins similar to indoxyl sulphates that may arise from interactions of ions
with humic acids contained in aqueous organic matter. However, while
agrochemical toxins are increasingly considered less relevant to the etiology
of CKDu, it has become a firm public belief. In Sri Lanka this has spawned
ideology-based agricultural policies for partial and complete banning of
agrochemicals (2014-2021), followed by some back-tracking, disrupting the
economy and the food supply. A farmer's uprising in 2022 was spawned by poor
harvests. It triggered a larger popular uprising that led to the collapse of a
government wedded to romanticized eco-extremist agricultural policies in a

achieving compatibility between miniaturized photonic devices and electronic

anisotropic scaling of the shapes of PhCs to impede the diffraction barrier and

each individual input/output format and dataset size. It has been common to
design a task-specific model and fine-tune it independently from a pre-trained
V+L model (e.g., CLIP). This results in parameter inefficiency and inability to
exploit inter-task relatedness. To address such issues, we propose a novel
FAshion-focused Multi-task Efficient learning method for Vision-and-Language
tasks (FAME-ViL) in this work. Compared with existing approaches, FAME-ViL
applies a single model for multiple heterogeneous fashion tasks, therefore
being much more parameter-efficient. It is enabled by two novel components: (1)
a task-versatile architecture with cross-attention adapters and task-specific
adapters integrated into a unified V+L model, and (2) a stable and effective
multi-task training strategy that supports learning from heterogeneous data and
prevents negative transfer. Extensive experiments on four fashion tasks show
that our FAME-ViL can save 61.5% of parameters over alternatives, while
significantly outperforming the conventional independently trained single-task

modeled by dynamics on a (time-dependent) high-dimensional landscape full of

trajectories tend to be very low-dimensional; (ii) scene elements that vary
more within training data tend to emerge earlier; and (iii) early perturbations
substantially change image content more often than late perturbations. We show
that the behavior of a variety of trained unconditional and conditional

Finally, we use our theory to search for the latent image manifold of diffusion

can be understood in terms of a vanishing Fermi velocity of the Dirac cone.
This is associated with van Hove singularities approaching the Fermi energy and
becoming higher-order. In the density of states this is reflected by flanking
logarithmic van Hove divergences pinching off the central Dirac cone in energy
space. The low-energy pseudogap of the Dirac cone away from the magic angle is
replaced by a power-law divergence due to the higher-order van Hove singularity
at the magic angle.
  This plays an important role in the exotic phenomena observed in this

correlation effects. Here we investigate one such correlation effect -- the
Kondo effect due to a magnetic impurity embedded in twisted bilayer graphene.
We use the Bistritzer-MacDonald model to extract the low-energy density of
states of the material as a function of twist angle, and study the resulting
quantum impurity physics using perturbative and numerical renormalization group
methods. Although at zero temperature the impurity is only Kondo screened
precisely at the magic angle, we find highly nontrivial behavior at finite

equations appear in many fields of physics and engineering. To solve these
kinds of problems, time-consuming step-by-step numerical integration methods
and convolution methods based on Volterra series in the time domain have been
widely used. In contrast, this work develops an efficient generalized
pole-residue method based on the Volterra series performed in the Laplace
domain. The proposed method involves two steps: (1) the Volterra kernels are
decoupled in terms of Laguerre polynomials, and (2) the partial response
related to a single Laguerre polynomial is obtained analytically in terms of
the pole-residue method. Compared to the traditional pole-residue method for a
linear system, one of the novelties of the pole-residue method in this paper is
how to deal with the higher-order poles and their corresponding coefficients.
Because the proposed method derives an explicit, continuous response function
of time, it is much more efficient than traditional numerical methods. Unlike
the traditional Laplace domain method, the proposed method is applicable to
arbitrary irregular excitations. Because the natural response, forced response
and cross response are naturally obtained in the solution procedure, meaningful
mathematical and physical insights are gained. In numerical studies, systems
with a known equation of motion and an unknown equation of motion are
investigated. For each system, regular excitations and complex irregular
excitations with different parameters are studied. Numerical studies validate
the good accuracy and high efficiency of the proposed method by comparing it
with the fourth-order Runge--Kutta method.

performance, area, and power/energy efficiency of a digital design at the cost
of output accuracy. We propose a novel scalable approximate multiplier that
utilizes a lookup table-based compensation unit. To improve energy-efficiency,
input operands are truncated to a reduced bitwidth representation (e.g., h
bits) based on their leading one positions. Then, a curve-fitting method is
employed to map the product term to a linear function, and a piecewise constant
error-correction term is used to reduce the approximation error. For computing
the piecewise constant error-compensation term, we partition the function space
into M segments and compute the compensation factor for each segment by
averaging the errors in the segment. The multiplier supports various degrees of
truncation and error-compensation to exploit accuracy-efficiency trade-off. The
proposed approximate multiplier offers better error metrics such as mean and
standard deviation of absolute relative error (MARED and StdARED) compare to a
state-of-the-art integer approximate multiplier. The proposed approximate
multiplier improves the MARED and StdARED by about 38% and 32% when its energy
consumption is about equal to the state-of-the-art approximate multiplier.
Moreover, the performance of the proposed approximate multiplier is evaluated
in image classification applications using a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The
results indicate that the degradation of DNN accuracy is negligible especially
due to the compensation properties of our approximate multiplier.

hosting spin qubits. However, controlling the energy splitting between the two
low-energy conduction-band valleys remains a critical challenge for scaling up
to large numbers of reliable qubits. Broad distributions of valley splittings
are commonplace, even among quantum dots formed on the same chip. Such behavior
has previously been attributed to imperfections such as steps at the quantum
well interface. The most common approaches for addressing this problem have
sought to engineer design improvements into the quantum well. In this work, we
develop a simple, universal theory of valley splitting based on the
reciprocal-space profile of the quantum well confinement potential, which
simultaneously explains the effects of steps, wide interfaces, alloy disorder,
and custom heterostructure designs. We use this understanding to characterize
theoretically the valley splitting in a variety of heterostructures, finding
that alloy disorder can explain the observed variability of the valley
splitting, even in the absence of steps. Moreover we show that steps have a
significant effect on the valley splitting only when the top interface is very
sharp. We predict a universal crossover from a regime where low valley
splittings are rare to a regime dominated by alloy disorder, in which valley
splittings can approach zero. We show that many recent experiments fall into
the latter category, with important implications for large-scale qubit
implementations. We finally propose a strategy to suppress the incidence of low
valley splittings by (i) increasing the random alloy disorder (to increase the
valley splitting variance), and then (ii) allowing for electrostatic tuning of
the dot position (to access locations with higher valley splitting).

(better far from the zero gradient points), and optimal in most cases. One of
the main ideas here is the fact that the singular part of the integral
representation of the fractional $p$-Laplacian behaves like a local
$p$-Laplacian with a weight correction. As a consequence of this, we also
revisit a previous asymptotic expansion for the classical $p$-Laplacian, whose
error orders were not known.
  Based on the previous result, we propose monotone finite difference
approximations of the fractional $p$-Laplacian with explicit weights and we
obtain the error estimates. Finally, we introduce explicit finite difference
schemes for the associated parabolic problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and show that it
is stable, monotone and convergent in the context of viscosity solutions. An
interesting feature is the fact that the stability condition improves with the
regularity of the initial data.

exponential and parabolic. As a result of the non-commutativity between
momentum and position operators, a diversity of effective potentials is
generated. We analyze the whole set and find unexpected coincidences as well as
discrepancies among them. We obtain analytically the full-spectrum of energies
and solutions in the twenty-five cases considered. It is shown how the simple
ordinary constant-mass solutions are transformed into a variety of complex
combinations of transcendental functions and arguments. We find that particles
with a non-uniform mass density can present discrete energy spectra as well as
continuous ones which can be bounded or not. These results are consistent with
the fact that although the external potential is zero, PDM eigenfunctions are
not actual free states but a sort of effective waves in a solid-state sample.
This is precisely the origin of the position-dependent mass. In all the events
we obtain exact complete spectral expressions. Our methodological procedure
thus puts a wide diversity of Hamiltonian seeds on an equal footing in order to
be compared. This allows choosing the better arrangement to model a specific

we propose HateMAML, a model-agnostic meta-learning-based framework that
effectively performs hate speech detection in low-resource languages. HateMAML
utilizes a self-supervision strategy to overcome the limitation of data

Model (SM) and Einstein gravity and their geometric interpretation. The SM and
Einstein gravity admit a natural embedding in Weyl integrable geometry which is
a special limit of Weyl conformal (non-metric) geometry. The theory has a {\it
local} Weyl scale symmetry but no associated gauge boson. Unlike previous
models with such symmetry, this embedding is truly minimal i.e. with no
additional fields beyond SM and underlying geometry. This theory is compared to
a similar minimal embedding of SM and Einstein gravity in Weyl conformal
geometry (SMW) which has a full {\it gauged} scale invariance, with an
associated Weyl gauge boson. At large field values, both theories give
realistic, Starobinsky-Higgs like inflation. The broken phase of the current
model is the decoupling limit of the massive Weyl gauge boson of the broken
phase of SMW, while the local scale symmetry of the current model is part of
the larger gauged scale symmetry of SMW. Hence, the current theory has a gauge
embedding in SMW. Unlike in the SMW, we note that in models with local scale
symmetry the associated current is trivial, which is a concern for the physical
meaning of this symmetry. Therefore, the SMW is a more fundamental UV
completion of SM in a full gauge theory of scale invariance that generates
Einstein gravity in the (spontaneously) broken phase, as an effective theory.

listening technology include (1) an inability to use personally owned receiving
devices, (2) a lack of high-fidelity stereo sound, (3) receiving devices not
providing an unoccluded listening experience, (4) distortion from alignment
delay and (5) a lack of automatic connectivity to an available assistive
listening audio signal.
  We propose solutions to each of these problems in an effort to pave the way
for mass adoption of assistive listening technology by the general public.

anomalous radio halo detected in data of the VLA. It is an outlier with regard
to the relation between the radio halo power and the X-ray luminosity of the
parent clusters. Aims. Our aim is to analyze the cluster in the optical, X-ray,
and radio bands to characterize the environment of its diffuse radio emission
and to shed new light on its nature. Methods. We used optical data from the
SDSS to study the internal dynamics of the cluster. We also analyzed archival
XMM-Newton X-ray data to unveil the properties of its hot intracluster medium.
Finally, we used recent data from LOFAR at 144 MHz, together with VLA data at
1.4 GHz, to study the spectral behavior of the diffuse radio source. Results.
Both our optical and X-ray analysis reveal that this low-mass cluster exhibits
disturbed dynamics. In fact, it is composed of several galaxy groups in the
peripheral regions and, in particular, in the core, where we find evidence of
substructures oriented in the NE-SW direction, with hints of a merger nearly
along the line of sight. The analysis of the X-ray emission adds further
evidence that the cluster is in an unrelaxed dynamical state. At radio
wavelengths, the LOFAR data show that the diffuse emission is ~510 kpc in size.
Moreover, there are hints of low-surface-brightness emission permeating the
cluster center. Conclusions. The environment of the diffuse radio emission is
not what we would expect for a classical halo. The spectral index map of the
radio source is compatible with a relic interpretation, possibly due to a
merger in the N-S or NE-SW directions, in agreement with the substructures
detected through the optical analysis. The fragmented, diffuse radio emissions
at the cluster center could be attributed to the surface brightness peaks of a
faint central radio halo.

are recursively split into sub-clades, and a clade of $m$ leaves is split into
sub-clades containing $i$ and $m-i$ leaves with probabilities $\propto
1/(i(m-i))$. This article provides an extensive overview of structure theory
and explicit quantitative aspects. There is a canonical embedding into a
continuous-time model, that is a random tree CTCS(n) on $n$ leaves with
real-valued edge lengths, and this model turns out more convenient to study. We
show that the family $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ is consistent under a ``delete
random leaf and prune"" operation. That leads to an explicit inductive
construction of $(\mbox{CTCS}(n), n \ge 2)$ as $n$ increases. An accompanying
technical article arXiv:2302.05066 studies in detail (with perhaps surprising

provides an opportunity for a ``compare and contrast"" discussion of the two
methodologies. We prove existence of the limit {\em fringe distribution}
relative to a random leaf, whose graphical representation is essentially the
format of the cladogram representation of biological phylogenies. We describe
informally the scaling limit process, as a process of splitting the continuous
interval $(0,1)$.
  These topics are somewhat analogous to those topics which have been well
studied in the context of the Brownian continuum random tree. Many open
problems remain.

decentralized min-max optimization for learning with domain constraints, where
multiple agents collectively solve a nonconvex-strongly-concave min-max saddle
point problem without coordination from any server. Decentralized min-max
optimization problems with domain constraints underpins many important ML
applications, including multi-agent ML fairness assurance, and policy
evaluations in multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithm
called PRECISION (proximal gradient-tracking and stochastic recursive variance
reduction) that enjoys a convergence rate of $O(1/T)$, where $T$ is the maximum
number of iterations. To further reduce sample complexity, we propose
PRECISION$^+$ with an adaptive batch size technique. We show that the fast
$O(1/T)$ convergence of PRECISION and PRECISION$^+$ to an $\epsilon$-stationary
point imply $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ communication complexity and
$O(m\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity, where $m$ is the number of
agents and $n$ is the size of dataset at each agent. To our knowledge, this is
the first work that achieves $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ in both sample and
communication complexities in decentralized min-max learning with domain
constraints. Our experiments also corroborate the theoretical results.

structural results concerning the group von Neumann algebra of

$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type $\text{II}_1$ factor. With a few additional

$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, in particular the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq
L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, where $F_d$ is the smallest of the Higman--Thompson

the inclusion $L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is irreducible, a
considerable improvement of the result that $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type

$L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$, which turns out to be ""trivial"" in the diverse case,
implying that the inclusion is also singular. Then we prove that the inclusion
$L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ satisfies the weak asymptotic
homomorphism property, which yields another proof that the inclusion is
singular. Finally, we finish the paper with an application: Using
irreducibility, our conditions for when $L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))$ is a type
$\text{II}_1$ McDuff factor, and the fact that $F_d$ is character rigid (in the
sense of Peterson), we prove that the groups $F_d$ are McDuff (in the sense of
Deprez-Vaes).

we allow individual neurons to play multiple distinct roles by analyzing

single/dual PINN methods improve the corresponding single/dual PINN methods by
incorporating an interpolation technique during the training process. The
success of the proposed PINN-based methods in predicting the nonlinear
vibration of two typical nonsmooth dynamics problems is verified: one is a
1-dimensional system with direct rigid contact considering stick-slip
oscillation, and the other is a 2-dimensional system with spring contact
considering separation-reattachment and stick-slip oscillation. Overall, the
developed PINN-based methods are accurate in predicting the nonsmooth dynamic
behaviour, which does not require a tiny time step as the conventional
time-stepping methods.

Large-scale systems are currently equipped with multiple GPU accelerators per

improvement; however, it also increases the complexity of programming for such
architectures. This work introduces a runtime framework that enables effortless
programming for heterogeneous systems while efficiently utilizing hardware

runtime system to facilitate performance portability across heterogeneous
nodes. Along with the design, this paper describes the implementation and
optimizations performed, achieving up to 300% improvement on a single device
and linear scalability on a node equipped with four GPUs. The framework in a
distributed memory environment offers portable abstractions that enable
efficient inter-node communication among devices with varying capabilities. It
delivers superior performance compared to MPI+CUDA by up to 20% for large
messages while keeping the overheads for small messages within 10\%.
Furthermore, the results of our performance evaluation in a distributed Jacobi
proxy application demonstrate that our software imposes minimal overhead and
achieves a performance improvement of up to 40%. This is accomplished by the
optimizations at the library level as well as by creating opportunities to
leverage application-specific optimizations like over-decomposition.

service. Its performance highly depends on the sequence construction and
request generation. However, existing REST API fuzzers have trouble generating
long sequences with well-constructed requests to trigger hard-to-reach states
in a cloud service, which limits their performance of finding deep errors and
security bugs. Further, they cannot find the specific errors caused by using
undefined parameters during request generation. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel hybrid data-driven solution, named MINER, with three new
designs working together to address the above limitations. First, MINER
collects the valid sequences whose requests pass the cloud service's checking
as the templates, and assigns more executions to long sequence templates.
Second, to improve the generation quality of requests in a sequence template,
MINER creatively leverages the state-of-the-art neural network model to predict
key request parameters and provide them with appropriate parameter values.
Third, MINER implements a new data-driven security rule checker to capture the
new kind of errors caused by undefined parameters. We evaluate MINER against
the state-of-the-art fuzzer RESTler on GitLab, Bugzilla, and WordPress via 11
REST APIs. The results demonstrate that the average pass rate of MINER is
23.42% higher than RESTler. MINER finds 97.54% more unique errors than RESTler
on average and 142.86% more reproducible errors after manual analysis. We have
reported all the newly found errors, and 7 of them have been confirmed as logic
bugs by the corresponding vendors.

approximate the complicated target density by a composition of self-reinforced

However, previous work using such functional composition has primarily focused
on specific instances of composition functions whose limiting assumptions allow
for exact zero-shot composition. Our work unifies these examples and provides a
more general framework for compositionality in both standard and

optimal solution for the composite task of interest can be related to the known
primitive task solutions. Specifically, we present double-sided inequalities
relating the optimal composite value function to the value functions for the

  Visual Just-Noticeable Differences",,,,,"cs.GR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, with the development of deep learning, a number of Just Noticeable
Difference (JND) datasets have been built for JND modeling. However, all the
existing JND datasets only label the JND points based on the level of
compression distortion. Hence, JND models learned from such datasets can only
be used for image/video compression. As known, JND is a major characteristic of
the human visual system (HVS), which reflects the maximum visual distortion
that the HVS can tolerate. Hence, a generalized JND modeling should take more
kinds of distortion types into account. To benefit JND modeling, this work
establishes a generalized JND dataset with a coarse-to-fine JND selection,
which contains 106 source images and 1,642 JND maps, covering 25 distortion
types. To this end, we proposed a coarse JND candidate selection scheme to
select the distorted images from the existing Image Quality Assessment (IQA)
datasets as JND candidates instead of generating JND maps ourselves. Then, a
fine JND selection is carried out on the JND candidates with a crowdsourced
subjective assessment.

magnetic cooling applications. It is suggested that a strong spin-lattice
coupling tends to generate a large magnetocaloric effect, but no microscopic
mechanism has been proposed. In this work, we use spin lattice dynamics
simulation to examine the lattice contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy
change in bcc iron (Fe) and hcp gadolinium (Gd) with exchange interaction
parameters determined from ab initio calculations. We find that indirect
Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction in hcp Gd leads to
longer range spin lattice coupling and more strongly influences the low
frequency long wavelength phonons. This results in a higher lattice
contribution towards the total magnetocaloric entropy change as compared to bcc
Fe with short range direct exchange interactions. Our analysis provides a
framework for understanding the magnetocaloric effect in magnetic materials
with strong spin lattice couplings. Our finding suggests that long range
indirect RKKY type exchange gives rise to a larger lattice contribution to the
magnetocaloric entropy change and is, thus, beneficial for magnetocaloric
materials.

poor data quality, such as high data sparsity and low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). Here we consider a matrix factorization problem by utilizing auxiliary
information, which is massively available in real applications, to overcome the
challenges caused by poor data quality. Unlike existing methods that mainly
rely on simple linear models to combine auxiliary information with the main
data matrix, we propose to integrate gradient boosted trees in the
probabilistic matrix factorization framework to effectively leverage auxiliary
information (MFAI). Thus, MFAI naturally inherits several salient features of
gradient boosted trees, such as the capability of flexibly modeling nonlinear
relationships, and robustness to irrelevant features and missing values in
auxiliary information. The parameters in MAFI can be automatically determined
under the empirical Bayes framework, making it adaptive to the utilization of
auxiliary information and immune to overfitting. Moreover, MFAI is
computationally efficient and scalable to large-scale datasets by exploiting
variational inference. We demonstrate the advantages of MFAI through
comprehensive numerical results from simulation studies and real data analysis.

other vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS). According to Open
Web Application Security Project (OWASP), CRLF vulnerabilities are among the

can help to quickly identify CRLF vulnerabilities, and is particularly useful
for companies to test their applications before releasing them. However, CRLF
vulnerabilities foster a better approach to mitigate CRLF vulnerabilities in
the early stage and help secure applications against high-risk known
vulnerabilities. There has been less research on CRLF vulnerabilities and how
to detect them with automated testing. There is room for further research to be
done on this subject matter in order to develop creative solutions to problems.
It will also help to reduce false positive alerts by checking the header
response of each request. Security automation is an important issue for
companies trying to protect themselves against security threats. Automated
alerts from security systems can provide a quicker and more accurate
understanding of potential vulnerabilities and can help to reduce false

policies from pre-collected demonstrations without interactions with the
environment. However, imitating behaviors fully offline typically requires
numerous expert data. To tackle this issue, we study the setting where we have
limited expert data and supplementary suboptimal data. In this case, a
well-known issue is the distribution shift between the learned policy and the
behavior policy that collects the offline data. Prior works mitigate this issue
by regularizing the KL divergence between the stationary state-action
distributions of the learned policy and the behavior policy. We argue that such
constraints based on exact distribution matching can be overly conservative and
hamper policy learning, especially when the imperfect offline data is highly
suboptimal. To resolve this issue, we present RelaxDICE, which employs an
asymmetrically-relaxed f-divergence for explicit support regularization.
Specifically, instead of driving the learned policy to exactly match the
behavior policy, we impose little penalty whenever the density ratio between
their stationary state-action distributions is upper bounded by a constant.
Note that such formulation leads to a nested min-max optimization problem,
which causes instability in practice. RelaxDICE addresses this challenge by
supporting a closed-form solution for the inner maximization problem. Extensive
empirical study shows that our method significantly outperforms the best prior
offline IL method in six standard continuous control environments with over 30%
performance gain on average, across 22 settings where the imperfect dataset is
highly suboptimal.

employs a temporal information sharing strategy to augment the number of

roles in daily life. However, manipulation of DLOs is challenging as large
geometrically nonlinear deformations may occur during the manipulation process.
This problem is made even more difficult as the different deformation modes
(e.g., stretching, bending, and twisting) may result in elastic instabilities
during manipulation. In this paper, we formulate a physics-guided data-driven
method to solve a challenging manipulation task -- accurately deploying a DLO
(an elastic rod) onto a rigid substrate along various prescribed patterns. Our
framework combines machine learning, scaling analysis, and physics-based
simulations to develop a physically informed neural controller for deployment.
We explore the complex interplay between the gravitational and elastic energies
of the manipulated DLO and obtain a control method for DLO deployment that is
robust against friction and material properties. Out of the numerous
geometrical and material properties of the rod and substrate, we show that only
three non-dimensional parameters are needed to describe the deployment process
with physical analysis. Therefore, the essence of the controlling law for the
manipulation task can be constructed with a low-dimensional model, drastically
increasing the computation speed. The effectiveness of our optimal control
scheme is shown through a comprehensive robotic case study comparing against a
heuristic control method for deploying rods for a wide variety of patterns. In
addition to this, we also showcase the practicality of our control scheme by
having a robot accomplish challenging high-level tasks such as mimicking human
handwriting and tying knots.

guaranteeing a stream of profits which is unaffected by arbitrary punishments.
This method applies to the sale of differentiated goods on (multiple) platforms

from the Hot and Cold QCD Town Meeting that took place September 23-25, 2022 at
MIT, as part of the Nuclear Science Advisory Committee (NSAC) 2023 Long Range
Planning process. A total of 424 physicists registered for the meeting. The
meeting highlighted progress in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) nuclear physics
since the 2015 LRP (LRP15) and identified key questions and plausible paths to
obtaining answers to those questions, defining priorities for our research over
the coming decade. In defining the priority of outstanding physics
opportunities for the future, both prospects for the short (~ 5 years) and
longer term (5-10 years and beyond) are identified together with the
facilities, personnel and other resources needed to maximize the discovery
potential and maintain United States leadership in QCD physics worldwide. This
White Paper is organized as follows: In the Executive Summary, we detail the
Recommendations and Initiatives that were presented and discussed at the Town
Meeting, and their supporting rationales. Section 2 highlights major progress
and accomplishments of the past seven years. It is followed, in Section 3, by
an overview of the physics opportunities for the immediate future, and in
relation with the next QCD frontier: the EIC. Section 4 provides an overview of
the physics motivations and goals associated with the EIC. Section 5 is devoted
to the workforce development and support of diversity, equity and inclusion.
This is followed by a dedicated section on computing in Section 6. Section 7
describes the national need for nuclear data science and the relevance to QCD
research.

voting, and other contexts is often hampered by the lack of individual-level
racial information in administrative records. In many cases, the law prohibits
the collection of such information to prevent direct racial discrimination. As
a result, many analysts have adopted Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding
(BISG), which combines individual names and addresses with the Census data to
predict race. Although BISG tends to produce well-calibrated racial
predictions, its residuals are often correlated with the outcomes of interest,
yielding biased estimates of racial disparities. We propose an alternative
identification strategy that corrects this bias. The proposed strategy is
applicable whenever one's surname is conditionally independent of the outcome
given their (unobserved) race, residence location, and other observed
characteristics. Leveraging this identification strategy, we introduce a new
class of models, Bayesian Instrumental Regression for Disparity Estimation
(BIRDiE), that estimate racial disparities by using surnames as a
high-dimensional instrumental variable for race. Our estimation method is
scalable, making it possible to analyze large-scale administrative data. We
also show how to address potential violations of the key identification
assumptions. A validation study based on the North Carolina voter file shows
that BIRDiE reduces error by up to 84% in comparison to the standard approaches
for estimating racial differences in party registration. Open-source software
is available which implements the proposed methodology.

as a black box without an entrance. At the output, there is a signal in the
form of aftershocks, the frequency of which decreases on average with time
according to the Omori law. The task of the researcher is to evaluate the
structure, state and mechanism of functioning of a dynamic system simulating
the earthquake source based on the output signal. In this paper, we outline an
approach to a partial solution of this general problem. Omori's law is
presented as a differential equation of aftershock evolution. An inverse
problem has been posed and solved, the essence of which is to determine the
source deactivation coefficient from the observed frequency of aftershocks. The
existence of the so-called Omori epoch, during which the deactivation
coefficient remains constant, has been discovered. At the end of the Omori
epoch, the deactivation coefficient experiences complex variations. A
hypothesis has been put forward that the end of the Omori epoch indicates a
bifurcation, i.e. about the transition of the source from one state to a
qualitatively different state. Our paper is written for the 100th anniversary
of the death of Fusakichi Omori. Keywords: aftershocks, Omori law, evolution

framework that can resolve high-resolution (HR) images at arbitrary scales from
the low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Treating the LR-HR image pairs as
continuous functions approximated with different grid sizes, SRNO learns the
mapping between the corresponding function spaces. From the perspective of
approximation theory, SRNO first embeds the LR input into a higher-dimensional
latent representation space, trying to capture sufficient basis functions, and
then iteratively approximates the implicit image function with a kernel
integral mechanism, followed by a final dimensionality reduction step to
generate the RGB representation at the target coordinates. The key
characteristics distinguishing SRNO from prior continuous SR works are: 1) the
kernel integral in each layer is efficiently implemented via the Galerkin-type
attention, which possesses non-local properties in the spatial domain and
therefore benefits the grid-free continuum; and 2) the multilayer attention
architecture allows for the dynamic latent basis update, which is crucial for
SR problems to ""hallucinate"" high-frequency information from the LR image.
Experiments show that SRNO outperforms existing continuous SR methods in terms
of both accuracy and running time. Our code is at

purely statistical outcome of a homogeneous vacuum. We then investigate the

different parts of speech of the input question, we gain insights to the
reasoning of the model, through the comparison of its responses in different

unprecedented cell recognition accuracy and efficiency compared to methods that
rely on intermediate density map representations. However, P2PNet could not
leverage multi-scale information since it can only decode a single feature map.
Moreover, the distribution of predefined point proposals, which is determined
by data properties, restricts the resolution of the feature map to decode,
i.e., the encoder design. To lift these limitations, we propose a variant of
P2PNet named deformable proposal-aware P2PNet (DPA-P2PNet) in this study. The
proposed method uses coordinates of point proposals to directly extract
multi-scale region-of-interest (ROI) features for feature enhancement. Such a
design also opens up possibilities to exploit dynamic distributions of

demonstrate that DPA-P2PNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
point-based cell recognition, which reveals the high potentiality in assisting

transmission. Among them, mapping and demapping convert a sequence of bits into
a sequence of complex numbers and vice versa. This operation is performed by a
system of constellations~ -- by a set of labeled points on the complex plane.
Usually, the geometry of the constellation is fixed, and constellation points
are uniformly spaced, e.g., the same quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is
used in a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By eliminating the
uniformity of constellations, it is possible to achieve greater values of
capacity. Due to the current standard restrictions, it is difficult to change
the constellation both on the mapper or demapper side. In this case, one can
optimize the constellation only on the mapper or the demapper side using
original methodology. By the numerical calculating of capacity, we show that
the optimal geometric constellation depends on SNR. Optimization is carried out
by maximizing mutual information (MI). The MI function describes the amount of
information being transmitted through the channel with the optimal encoding. To
prove the effectiveness of this approach we provide numerical experiments in
the modern physical level Sionna simulator using the realistic LDPC codes and

  Environment","Paper submitted to IROS 2023",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Operating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in complex environments that
feature dynamic obstacles and external disturbances poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the inherent uncertainty in such scenarios.
Additionally, inaccurate robot localization and modeling errors further
exacerbate these challenges. Recent research on UAV motion planning in static
environments has been unable to cope with the rapidly changing surroundings,
resulting in trajectories that may not be feasible. Moreover, previous
approaches that have addressed dynamic obstacles or external disturbances in
isolation are insufficient to handle the complexities of such environments.
This paper proposes a reliable motion planning framework for UAVs, integrating
various uncertainties into a chance constraint that characterizes the
uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. The chance constraint provides a
probabilistic safety certificate by calculating the collision probability
between the robot's Gaussian-distributed forward reachable set and states of
obstacles. To reduce the conservatism of the planned trajectory, we propose a
tight upper bound of the collision probability and evaluate it both exactly and
approximately. The approximated solution is used to generate motion primitives
as a reference trajectory, while the exact solution is leveraged to iteratively
optimize the trajectory for better results. Our method is thoroughly tested in
simulation and real-world experiments, verifying its reliability and
effectiveness in uncertain environments.

down to detecting the changes from noisy brightness values. To this end, we
extend a denoising method based on a weighted local regression (WLR) to detect
the brightness changes rather than applying denoising to each video frame.
Specifically, we regress a WLR model only on frames where an event is detected,
which significantly reduces the computational cost of the regression. We show
that our efficient method is robust to noisy video frames obtained from a few
path-traced samples and performs comparably to or even better than an approach
that denoises every frame.

electron Green's function $G$. The electrons are treated at a mean-field level
and the nuclei dynamics is described with a Gaussian distribution function,
which can effectively take into account anharmonic effects at a mean-field
level, e.g. within the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Pivotal
quantities of the Gaussian $GW^{(en)}$ self-energy are the renormalized average
vertices, which are computed in supercells with a stochastic approach, using
the the self-consistent electronic potential computed for different atomic
configurations. In order to validate the method, $GW^{(en)}$ calculations are
performed on aluminum, a highly harmonic system with weak electron-phonon
coupling. The obtained results coincide with the ones obtained with standard
linear electron-phonon calculations. However, calculations performed on
palladium hydride, a very anharmonic system, show a highly non-linear
electron-phonon interaction, with $GW^{(en)}$ bringing corrections as high as
the linear-order result.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The network security analyzers use intrusion detection systems (IDSes) to
distinguish malicious traffic from benign ones. The deep learning-based IDSes
are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the
time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new
generation of IDSes still suffers from a number of challenges. One of the main
issues of an IDS is facing traffic concept drift which manifests itself as new
(i.e., zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign
users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed
to a distributed architecture to handle big data challenges.
  We propose a framework for adapting DL-based models to the changing
attack/benign traffic behaviors, considering a more practical scenario (i.e.,
online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly
detectors in addition to the federated learning approach to solve the
above-mentioned challenges. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements
sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability
score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its
estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep
models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and
CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we
show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic
concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models
are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e.,
achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new
flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate
for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e., detecting
intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets).

  Our result is then extended to the multivariate setting, and for polynomial

the existence of negative moments to some explicit spectral quantities

scheduling paradigm for Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Distributed

with centralized AIM, distributed AIM can be deployed to CAVs at a lower cost,
and compared with rule-based and optimization-based method, learning-based
method can treat various complicated real-time intersection scenarios more
flexibly. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is the mainstream approach in
distributed learning to address AIM problems. However, the large-scale
simultaneous interactive decision of multiple agents and the rapid changes of
environment caused by interactions pose challenges for DRL, making its reward
curve oscillating and hard to converge, and ultimately leading to a compromise
in safety and computing efficiency. For this, we propose a non-RL learning
framework, called Distributed Hierarchical Adversarial Learning (D-HAL). The
framework includes an actor network that generates the actions of each CAV at
each step. The immediate discriminator evaluates the interaction performance of
the actor network at the current step, while the final discriminator makes the
final evaluation of the overall trajectory from a series of interactions. In
this framework, the long-term outcome of the behavior no longer motivates the
actor network in terms of discounted rewards, but rather through a designed
adversarial loss function with discriminative labels. The proposed model is
evaluated at a four-way-six-lane intersection, and outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods on ensuring safety and reducing travel time.

of units with the subspace topology is a topological group. We prove that every

learning algorithms. In particular, the Swish activation function tends to
outperform ReLU on deeper models, including deep reinforcement learning models,
across challenging tasks. Despite this progress, ReLU is the preferred function
partly because it is more efficient than Swish. Furthermore, in contrast to the
fields of computer vision and natural language processing, the deep
reinforcement learning and robotics domains have seen less inclination to adopt
new activation functions, such as Swish, and instead continue to use more
traditional functions, like ReLU. To tackle those issues, we propose Swim, a
general-purpose, efficient, and high-performing alternative to Swish, and then
provide an analysis of its properties as well as an explanation for its
high-performance relative to Swish, in terms of both reward-achievement and
efficiency. We focus on testing Swim on MuJoCo's locomotion continuous control
tasks since they exhibit more complex dynamics and would therefore benefit most
from a high-performing and efficient activation function. We also use the TD3
algorithm in conjunction with Swim and explain this choice in the context of
the robot locomotion domain. We then conclude that Swim is a state-of-the-art
activation function for continuous control locomotion tasks and recommend using
it with TD3 as a working framework.

overall road safety. Missing traffic signs are a regular part of such roads.
Missing or non-existing object detection has been studied for locating missing
curbs and estimating reasonable regions for pedestrians on road scene images.
Such methods involve analyzing task-specific single object cues. In this paper,
we present the first and most challenging video dataset for missing objects,
with multiple types of traffic signs for which the cues are visible without the
signs in the scenes. We refer to it as the Missing Traffic Signs Video Dataset
(MTSVD). MTSVD is challenging compared to the previous works in two aspects i)
The traffic signs are generally not present in the vicinity of their cues, ii)
The traffic signs cues are diverse and unique. Also, MTSVD is the first
publicly available missing object dataset. To train the models for identifying
missing signs, we complement our dataset with 10K traffic sign tracks, with 40
percent of the traffic signs having cues visible in the scenes. For identifying
missing signs, we propose the Cue-driven Contextual Attention units (CueCAn),
which we incorporate in our model encoder. We first train the encoder to
classify the presence of traffic sign cues and then train the entire
segmentation model end-to-end to localize missing traffic signs. Quantitative
and qualitative analysis shows that CueCAn significantly improves the
performance of base models.

  International Conference on Communications (ICC)",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, a compressed sensing (CS) based framework of multi-target
cooperative visible light positioning (VLP) is formulated to realize
simultaneous highaccuracy localization of multiple targets. The light emitting
diodes (LEDs) intended for illumination are utilized to locate multiple target
mobile terminals equipped with photodetectors. The indoor area can be divided
into a two-dimensional grid of discrete points, and the targets are located in
only a few grid points, which has a sparse property. Thus, the multitarget
localization problem can be transferred into a sparse recovery problem.
Specifically, a CS-based framework is formulated exploiting the superposition
of the received visible light signals at the multiple targets to be located via
intertarget cooperation. Then it can be efficiently resolved using CS-based
algorithms. Moreover, inter-anchor cooperation is introduced to the CS-based
framework by the crosscorrelation between the signals corresponding to
different LEDs, i.e., anchors, which further improves the localization
accuracy. Enabled by the proposed CS-based framework and the devised
cooperation mechanism, the proposed scheme can simultaneously locate multiple
targets with high precision and low computational complexity. Simulation
results show that the proposed schemes can achieve centimeter-level multitarget
positioning with sub-meter accuracy, which outperforms existing benchmark
schemes.

than their arithmetical complexity. The derivation starts with nesting of
Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of size N = q_1 q_2 ... q_r, where q_i are
powers of prime numbers: DFT is mapped into multidimensional one, Rader
convolutions of q_i-point DFTs extracted, and combined into multidimensional
convolutions processing data in parallel. Crucial to further optimization is
the observation that multiplicative complexity of such algorithm is upper
bounded by 0(Nlog M_max), where M_max is the size of the greatest structure
containing multiplications. Then the size of the structures is diminished:
Firstly, computation of a circular convolution can be done as in Rader-Winograd
algorithms. Secondly, multidimensional convolutions can be computed using
polynomial transforms. It is shown that careful choice of q_i values leads to
important reduction of M_max value: Multiplicative complexity of the new DFT
algorithms is O(Nlog^c log N) for c\le 1, while for more addition-orietnted
ones it is O(Nlog^{1/m} N), m is a natural number denoting class of q_i values.
Smaller values of c, 1/m are obtained for algorithms requiring more additions,
part of algorithms for c = 1, m=2 have arithmetical complexity smaller than

commonly used for accurate patient positioning during the image-guided

inaccurate Hounsfield unit (HU) values prevent its use for quantitative
applications such as organ segmentation and dose calculation. To enable the
clinical practice of online ART, it is crucial to obtain CBCT scans with a
quality comparable to that of a CT scan. Purpose: This work aims to develop a
conditional diffusion model to perform image translation from the CBCT to the
CT domain for the image quality improvement of CBCT. Methods: The proposed
method is a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) that
utilizes a time-embedded U-net architecture with residual and attention blocks
to gradually transform standard Gaussian noise to the target CT distribution
conditioned on the CBCT. The model was trained on deformed planning CT (dpCT)
and CBCT image pairs, and its feasibility was verified in brain patient study
and head-and-neck (H&N) patient study. The performance of the proposed
algorithm was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise

researchers mainly focus on small-scale instances with the number of circular
items n less than 320 in the literature. In this work, we aim to solve this

optimization method that not only can significantly speed up the convergence
process of continuous optimization but also reduce the memory requirement

field. Furthermore, different cooling procedures were tested, cooling from the
paramagnetic phase at zero magnetic field and field cooling through the
skyrmion phase where metastable skyrmions are nucleated. From this, not only
were the stability ranges of both the helical and skyrmion phases in this
multiferroic skyrmion material determined, but the length of the spin helix and
the skyrmion distances at different conditions was also determined through
detailed analysis of the positions of the observed Bragg peaks. The obtained

might be deteriorated in case of uncoordinated massive access requests. To
dynamically preserve the sparsity of access requests, a reinforcement-learning
(RL)-assisted scheme of closed-loop access control utilizing the access class
barring technique is proposed, where the RL policy is determined through
continuous interaction between the RL agent, i.e., a next generation node base

detection (PAD), which aims to secure face recognition systems against
presentation attacks, owing to the availability of several face PAD datasets.
However, all available datasets are based on privacy and legally-sensitive
authentic biometric data with a limited number of subjects. To target these
legal and technical challenges, this work presents the first synthetic-based
face PAD dataset, named SynthASpoof, as a large-scale PAD development dataset.
The bona fide samples in SynthASpoof are synthetically generated and the attack
samples are collected by presenting such synthetic data to capture systems in a
real attack scenario. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of
using SynthASpoof for the development of face PAD. Moreover, we boost the
performance of such a solution by incorporating the domain generalization tool
MixStyle into the PAD solutions. Additionally, we showed the viability of using
synthetic data as a supplement to enrich the diversity of limited authentic
training data and consistently enhance PAD performances. The SynthASpoof
dataset, containing 25,000 bona fide and 78,800 attack samples, the
implementation, and the pre-trained weights are made publicly available.

fundamental features of quantum theory in a single form that is amenable to
efficient verification, and that is robust to errors arising in state

figure of merit that for quantum theory captures the coherence of a quantum
channel - to general physical theories. Then, we introduce the notion of
compatible unitarity pair (CUP) sets, that correspond to the allowed values of
unitarities for compatible channels in the theory. We show that a CUP-set
constitutes a simple 'fingerprint' of a physical theory, and that
incompatibility can be studied through them. We derive information-disturbance
constraints on quantum CUP-sets that encode both the no-cloning/broadcasting

Although several SemiFL approaches have been proposed recently, none of them

the adversarial vulnerabilities of DL-based crowd-flow prediction models under
multiple threat settings, making three-fold contributions. (1) We propose
CaV-detect by formally identifying two novel properties - Consistency and
Validity - of the crowd-flow prediction inputs that enable the detection of
standard adversarial inputs with 0% false acceptance rate (FAR). (2) We
leverage universal adversarial perturbations and an adaptive adversarial loss
to present adaptive adversarial attacks to evade CaV-detect defense. (3) We
propose CVPR, a Consistent, Valid and Physically-Realizable adversarial attack,
that explicitly inducts the consistency and validity priors in the perturbation
generation mechanism. We find out that although the crowd-flow models are
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, it is extremely challenging to
simulate these perturbations in physical settings, notably when CaV-detect is
in place. We also show that CVPR attack considerably outperforms the adaptively
modified standard attacks in FAR and adversarial loss metrics. We conclude with

external electric field and Heptanol, a drug blocking gap junctions, as two
separate controls affecting the Ca2+ activity and pausing the regeneration

increases the calcium activity and its spatial correlations, while applying
Heptanol inhibits the activity and weakens the spatial correlations. The
statistical characteristics of the Ca2+ spatial fluctuations, i.e., the
coefficient of variation and the skewness - exhibit universal shape
distributions across tissue samples and conditions, demonstrating the existence
of global constraints over this field. Our analysis shows that the Hydra's
tissue resides near the onset of bistability; the local Ca2+ activity in
different regions fluctuates between low and high excited states. The controls
modulate the dynamics near that onset, preserving the universal characteristics

such unconventional data present significant research challenges as traditional
vision algorithms are not directly applicable to this sensing modality. The
proposed method decomposes the tracking problem into a local SE(2)
motion-compensation step followed by a homography registration of small
motion-compensated event batches. The first component relies on Gaussian
Process (GP) theory to model the continuous occupancy field of the events in
the image plane and embed the camera trajectory in the covariance kernel
function. In doing so, estimating the trajectory is done similarly to GP
hyperparameter learning by maximising the log marginal likelihood of the data.
The continuous occupancy fields are turned into distance fields and used as
templates for homography-based registration. By benchmarking the proposed
method against other state-of-the-art techniques, we show that our open-source

By taking advantage of both solid-state and spinnings LiDARs, and built-in
inertial measurement units (IMU), we achieve both robust and low-drift
ego-estimation as well as high-resolution maps in diverse challenging indoor
environments (e.g., small, featureless rooms). First, we use spatial-temporal
calibration modules to align the timestamp and calibrate extrinsic parameters
between sensors. Then, we extract two groups of feature points including edge
and plane points, from LiDAR data. Next, with pre-integrated IMU data, an
undistortion module is applied to the LiDAR point cloud data. Finally, the
undistorted point clouds are merged into one point cloud and processed with a
sliding window based optimization module. From extensive experiment results,
our method shows competitive performance with state-of-the-art

There are three principled ways to deal with non-stationarity, including
sliding-window, weighted, and restart strategies. As many non-stationary
environments exhibit gradual drifting patterns, the weighted strategy is
commonly adopted in real-world applications. However, previous theoretical
studies show that its analysis is more involved and the algorithms are either
computationally less efficient or statistically suboptimal. This paper revisits
the weighted strategy for non-stationary parametric bandits. In linear bandits
(LB), we discover that this undesirable feature is due to an inadequate regret
analysis, which results in an overly complex algorithm design. We propose a
refined analysis framework, which simplifies the derivation and importantly
produces a simpler weight-based algorithm that is as efficient as
window/restart-based algorithms while retaining the same regret as previous
studies. Furthermore, our new framework can be used to improve regret bounds of
other parametric bandits, including Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) and
Self-Concordant Bandits (SCB). For example, we develop a simple weighted GLB
algorithm with an $\widetilde{O}(k_\mu^{\frac{5}{4}} c_\mu^{-\frac{3}{4}}
d^{\frac{3}{4}} P_T^{\frac{1}{4}}T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ regret, improving the

manually designed 3D/2D CNN structures with approximations or automatic search,
which sacrifice the modeling ability or make training time-consuming. In this
work, we propose to automatically design efficient 3D CNN architectures via a
novel training-free neural architecture search approach tailored for 3D CNNs
considering the model complexity. To measure the expressiveness of 3D CNNs
efficiently, we formulate a 3D CNN as an information system and derive an
analytic entropy score, based on the Maximum Entropy Principle. Specifically,
we propose a spatio-temporal entropy score (STEntr-Score) with a refinement
factor to handle the discrepancy of visual information in spatial and temporal
dimensions, through dynamically leveraging the correlation between the feature
map size and kernel size depth-wisely. Highly efficient and expressive 3D CNN
architectures, \ie entropy-based 3D CNNs (E3D family), can then be efficiently
searched by maximizing the STEntr-Score under a given computational budget, via
an evolutionary algorithm without training the network parameters. Extensive
experiments on Something-Something V1\&V2 and Kinetics400 demonstrate that the

Hence, it is of paramount significance to understand the bugs (especially the
bugs involving multiple PLs, i.e., MPL bugs) of DLFs, which can provide a
foundation for preventing, detecting, and resolving bugs in the development of
DLFs. To this end, we manually analyzed 1497 bugs in three MPL DLFs, namely
MXNet, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. First, we classified bugs in these DLFs into 12
types (e.g., algorithm design bugs and memory bugs) according to their bug
labels and characteristics. Second, we further explored the impacts of
different bug types on the development of DLFs, and found that deployment bugs
and memory bugs negatively impact the development of DLFs in different aspects
the most. Third, we found that 28.6%, 31.4%, and 16.0% of bugs in MXNet,
PyTorch, and TensorFlow are MPL bugs, respectively; the PL combination of
Python and C/C++ is most used in fixing more than 92% MPL bugs in all DLFs.
Finally, the code change complexity of MPL bug fixes is significantly greater
than that of single-programming-language (SPL) bug fixes in all the three DLFs,
while in PyTorch MPL bug fixes have longer open time and greater communication
complexity than SPL bug fixes. These results provide insights for bug

the lifting property to characters of semisimple representations is established
in characteristic 0 for Brauer categories with at most countably many objects.

Surprisingly, this induced flocking phase exhibits anisotropic giant number

clearly important role of momentum conservation between the swimmers and the

  https://paulyzheng.github.io/research/hairstep/",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of learning-based single-view
3D hair modeling. Due to the great difficulty of collecting paired real image
and 3D hair data, using synthetic data to provide prior knowledge for real
domain becomes a leading solution. This unfortunately introduces the challenge
of domain gap. Due to the inherent difficulty of realistic hair rendering,
existing methods typically use orientation maps instead of hair images as input
to bridge the gap. We firmly think an intermediate representation is essential,
but we argue that orientation map using the dominant filtering-based methods is
sensitive to uncertain noise and far from a competent representation. Thus, we
first raise this issue up and propose a novel intermediate representation,
termed as HairStep, which consists of a strand map and a depth map. It is found
that HairStep not only provides sufficient information for accurate 3D hair
modeling, but also is feasible to be inferred from real images. Specifically,
we collect a dataset of 1,250 portrait images with two types of annotations. A
learning framework is further designed to transfer real images to the strand
map and depth map. It is noted that, an extra bonus of our new dataset is the
first quantitative metric for 3D hair modeling. Our experiments show that

structure due to deformation, a simple infinite-well potential model is
employed with octupole shape parametrized by merging a sphere and a paraboloid.
Attention is paid to the contributions of the degenerate families of periodic
orbits (POs) confined in the spherical portion of the potential, that are
expected to partially preserve the spherical shell effect up to considerably
large value of the octupole parameter. The contribution of those POs to the

are now entering a new era, with broadband, highly sensitive radio observations
and new analysis methods. To reveal the magnetic field configuration from the
observed value integrated along the line of sight, it is necessary to derive an
appropriate model that can reproduce the observational characteristics. We aim
to clarify the relationship between the radiation field and the spatial
distribution of physical quantities through pseudo-observations using global 3D
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation results. In particular, we focus on using
the depolarization effect to verify the polarization model and to identify the
emission region. First, we show that wavelength-independent depolarization,
which takes into account anisotropic turbulence, does not work efficiently
because the polarized emission is stronger in regions of ordered spiral fields
than in regions dominated by isotropic turbulent fields. Beam depolarization
becomes more effective below 1 GHz. Although close to the equatorial plane
there will be strong depolarization which increases with observing wavelength,
this effect is less in the halo, making halo magnetic fields detectable through
their polarized emission at meter-wavelength bands. Although polarized emission
from the halo is below the detection limit of current facilities, it will be
detectable within the SKA era. In addition, we found that the spiral
polarization projected on a screen is produced by overlapping magnetic flux
tubes extending to different heights from the equatorial plane. This suggests
that the traditional classification of global magnetic fields has difficulty
reproducing the global structure of the magnetic fields. Finally, we
demonstrate the method to separate magnetic flux tubes at different heights by
using peak frequencies which cause the decreasing of polarized flux.

graph classification. We commence by performing the Continuous-time Quantum
Walk (CTQW) on each graph structure, and computing the Averaged Mixing Matrix
(AMM) to describe how the CTQW visit all vertices from a starting vertex. More
specifically, we show how this AMM matrix allows us to compute a quantum
Shannon entropy for each vertex of a graph. For pairwise graphs, the proposed
AERK kernel is defined by computing a reproducing kernel based similarity
between the quantum Shannon entropies of their each pair of aligned vertices.
The analysis of theoretical properties reveals that the proposed AERK kernel
cannot only address the shortcoming of neglecting the structural correspondence
information between graphs arising in most existing R-convolution graph
kernels, but also overcome the problem of neglecting the structural differences
between pairs of aligned vertices arising in existing vertex-based matching
kernels. Moreover, unlike existing classical graph kernels that only focus on
the global or local structural information of graphs, the proposed AERK kernel
can simultaneously capture both global and local structural information through
the quantum Shannon entropies, reflecting more precise kernel based similarity
measures between pairs of graphs. The above theoretical properties explain the
effectiveness of the proposed kernel. The experimental evaluation on standard
graph datasets demonstrates that the proposed AERK kernel is able to outperform
state-of-the-art graph kernels for graph classification tasks.

dormancy is a process involving the oxygen-depleted environment encountered
inside the lung granuloma, where bacilli enter a viable, non-replicating state
termed as latency. Affecting nearly two billion people, latent TB can linger in
the host for indefinite periods of time before resuscitating, which
significantly strains the accuracy of treatment options and patient prognosis.
Transcriptional factors thought to mediate this process have only conferred
mild growth defects, signaling that our current understanding of the MTB
genetic architecture is highly insufficient. In light of these inconsistencies,
the objective of this study was to characterize regulatory mechanisms
underlying the transition of MTB into dormancy. The project methodology
involved a three-part approach - constructing an aggregate hypoxia dataset,
inferring a gene regulatory network based on those observations, and leveraging
several downstream network analyses to make sense of it all. Results indicated
dormancy to be functionally associated with cell redox homeostasis, metal ion
cycling, and cell wall metabolism, all of which modulate essential
host-pathogen interactions. Additionally, the crosstalk between individual
regulons (Rv0821c and Rv0144; Rv1152 and Rv2359) was shown to be critical in
facilitating bacterial persistence and allowing MTB to gain control over key
micronutrients within the cell. Defense antioxidants and nutritional immunity
were also identified as future avenues to explore further. In providing some of
the first insights into the methods utilized by MTB to endure in a hypoxic
state, this research suggests a range of strategies that might aid in improved
clinical outcomes of TB treatment.

to coordinate kernel launches, CPU tasks, and communication. This combination
allows us to have a fine interleaving between portable CPU/GPU computations and
communication, enabling scalability on various supercomputers. However, for HPX
and Kokkos to work together optimally, we need to be able to treat Kokkos
kernels as HPX tasks. Otherwise, instead of integrating asynchronous Kokkos
kernel launches into HPX's task graph, we would have to actively wait for them
with fence commands, which wastes CPU time better spent otherwise. Using an
integration layer called HPX-Kokkos, treating Kokkos kernels as tasks already
works for some Kokkos execution spaces (like the CUDA one), but not for others

extending the support of HPX-Kokkos to also fully support Kokkos' SYCL

test them using Octo-Tiger and its Kokkos kernels, on both an NVIDIA A100 and

control over the final shape. The same enabling high dimensionality, however,
poses a challenge for solving the inverse design problem involving this class
of structures: to achieve desired 3D structures it typically requires
manufacturing technologies with extensive local actuation and control during
fabrication, and a trial and error search over a large design space. We address
both of these shortcomings by first developing a simplified planar fabrication
approach that combines two ingredients: strain mismatch between two layers of a
composite shell and kirigami cuts that relieves localized stress. In principle,
it is possible to generate targeted 3-D shapes by designing the appropriate
kirigami cuts and selecting the right amount of prestretch, thereby eliminating
the need for local control. Second, we formulate a data-driven physics-guided
framework that reduces the dimensionality of the inverse design problem using
autoencoders and efficiently searches through the ``latent"" parameter space in
an active learning approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the rapid
design procedure via a range of target shapes, such as peanuts, pringles,

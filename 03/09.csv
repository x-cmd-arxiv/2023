  Knowledge Distillation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we introduce a feature knowledge distillation framework to
improve low-resolution (LR) face recognition performance using knowledge
obtained from high-resolution (HR) images. The proposed framework transfers
informative features from an HR-trained network to an LR-trained network by
reducing the distance between them. A cosine similarity measure was employed as
a distance metric to effectively align the HR and LR features. This approach
differs from conventional knowledge distillation frameworks, which use the L_p
distance metrics and offer the advantage of converging well when reducing the
distance between features of different resolutions. Our framework achieved a 3%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art method on the AgeDB-30 benchmark
without bells and whistles, while maintaining a strong performance on HR
images. The effectiveness of cosine similarity as a distance metric was
validated through statistical analysis, making our approach a promising
solution for real-world applications in which LR images are frequently
encountered. The code and pretrained models are publicly available on

  Atmospheric Neutrinos with IceCube","Preprint submitted to EPJC",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Atmospheric muon neutrinos are produced by meson decays in cosmic-ray-induced
air showers. The flux depends on meteorological quantities such as the air
temperature, which affects the density of air. Competition between decay and
re-interaction of those mesons in the first particle production generations
gives rise to a higher neutrino flux when the air density in the stratosphere
is lower, corresponding to a higher temperature. A measurement of a temperature
dependence of the atmospheric $\nu_{\mu}$ flux provides a novel method for
constraining hadro\-nic interaction models of air showers. It is particularly
sensitive to the production of kaons. Studying this temperature dependence for
the first time requires a large sample of high-energy neutrinos as well as a
detailed understanding of atmospheric properties. We report the significant ($>
10 \sigma$) observation of a correlation between the rate of more than 260,000
neutrinos, detected by IceCube between 2012 and 2018, and atmospheric
temperatures of the stratosphere, measured by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder
(AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's AQUA satellite. For the observed 10$\%$
seasonal change of effective atmospheric temperature we measure a 3.5(3)$\%$
change in the muon neutrino flux. This observed correlation deviates by about
2-3 standard deviations from the expected correlation of 4.3$\%$ as obtained
from theoretical predictions under the assumption of various hadronic

services mirroring the real world. Wireless communications for mobile Metaverse
users should be tailored to meet the following user characteristics: 1)
emphasizing application-specific perceptual utility instead of simply the
transmission rate, 2) concerned with energy efficiency due to the limited
device battery and energy intensiveness of some applications, and 3) caring
about security as the applications may involve sensitive personal data. To this
end, this paper incorporates application-specific utility, energy efficiency,
and physical-layer security (PLS) into the studied optimization in a wireless
network for the Metaverse. Specifically, after introducing utility-energy
efficiency (UEE) to represent each Metaverse user's application-specific
objective under PLS, we formulate an optimization to maximize the network's
weighted sum-UEE by deciding users' transmission powers and communication
bandwidths. The formulated problem belongs to the sum-of-ratios optimization,
for which prior studies have demonstrated its difficulty. Nevertheless, our
proposed algorithm 1) obtains the global optimum for the weighted sum-UEE
optimization, via a transform to parametric convex optimization problems, 2)
applies to any utility function which is concave, increasing, and twice
differentiable, and 3) achieves a linear time complexity in the number of users
(the optimal complexity in the order sense). Simulations confirm the
superiority of our algorithm over other approaches. We explain that our
technique for solving the sum-of-ratios optimization is applicable to other
optimization problems in wireless networks and mobile computing.

conjecture asserts that all black holes in General Relativity coupled to any
matter must be Kerr-Newman type. However, the conjecture fails in some cases
with non-linear matter sources. Here, we address this by explicitly
constructing multiple slow-rotating black hole solutions, up to second order in
rotational parameter, for a class of $f(R)$ models. We analytically show that
two vacuum solutions satisfy the field equations up to the second order in the
rotational parameter. The uniqueness of our result stems from the fact that
these are obtained directly from metric formalism without conformal
transformation. We discuss the kinematical properties of these black hole
solutions and compare them with slow-rotating Kerr. Specifically, we show that
the circular orbits for the black holes in $f(R)$ are smaller than that of
Kerr. This implies that the inner-most stable circular orbit for black holes in
$f(R)$ is smaller than Kerr's; hence the shadow radius might also be smaller.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for future observations.

nanotechnology is an efficient scheme for the direct amplification of
propagating spin waves. The recent discovery of spin-orbit torque provided an
elegant mechanism for propagation losses compensation. While partial
compensation of the spin-wave damping has allowed for spin-wave signal
modulation, true amplification - the exponential increase in the spin-wave
intensity during propagation - has so far remained elusive. Here we evidence
the operating conditions to achieve unambiguous amplification using clocked
nanoseconds -long spin-orbit torque pulses in sub-micrometer wide magnonic
waveguides, where the effective magnetization has been engineered to be close
to zero to suppress the detrimental magnon-magnon scattering. As a result, we
achieve an exponential increase in the intensity of propagating spin waves up

the way towards the implementation of energy efficient, cascadable magnonic

(VOLTA) for cell representation learning in histopathology images using a novel
technique that accounts for the cell's mutual relationship with its environment
for improved cell representations. We subjected our model to extensive
experiments on the data collected from multiple institutions around the world
comprising of over 700,000 cells, four cancer types, and cell types ranging
from three to six categories for each dataset. The results show that our model
outperforms the state-of-the-art models in cell representation learning. To
showcase the potential power of our proposed framework, we applied VOLTA to
ovarian and endometrial cancers with very small sample sizes (10-20 samples)
and demonstrated that our cell representations can be utilized to identify the
known histotypes of ovarian cancer and provide novel insights that link
histopathology and molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer. Unlike supervised

its clear advantages over substrates commonly used in heteroepitaxial growth,
several fundamental properties of ScAlMgO4 remain unsettled. Here, we provide a
comprehensive picture of its optical, electronic and structural properties by
studying ScAlMgO4 single crystals grown by the Czochralski method. We use
variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry to determine complex in-plane and
out-of-plane refractive indices in the range from 193 to 1690 nm. An
oscillator-based model provides a phenomenological description of the
ellipsometric spectra with excellent agreement over the entire range of
wavelengths. For convenience, we supply the reader also with Cauchy formulas
describing the real part of the anisotropic refractive index for wavelengths
above 400 nm. Ab initio many-body perturbation theory modeling provides
information about the electronic structure of ScAlMgO4, and successfully
validated experimentally obtained refractive index values. Simulations also
show exciton binding energy as large as a few hundred of meV, indicating
ScAlMgO4 as a promising material for implementation in low-threshold, deep-UV
lasing devices operating at room temperature. X-ray diffraction measurements
confirm lattice constants of ScAlMgO4 previously reported, but in addition,
reveal that dominant crystallographic planes (001) are mutually inclined by
about 0.009{\deg}. In view of our work, ScAlMgO4 is a highly transparent, low
refractive index, birefringent material similar to a sapphire, but with a much
more favorable lattice constant and simpler processing.

multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes, encoding a qubit in many

closest point decoding strategy for correcting random Gaussian shift errors.
For decoding a generic multimode GKP code, we first identify its corresponding
lattice followed by finding the closest lattice point in its symplectic dual
lattice to a candidate shift error compatible with the error syndrome. We use
this method to characterize the error correction capabilities of several known
multimode GKP codes, including their code distances and fidelities. We also
perform numerical optimization of multimode GKP codes up to ten modes and find
two instances (with three and nine modes) with better code distances and
fidelities compared to the known GKP codes with the same number of modes. While
exact closest point decoding incurs exponential time cost in the number of
modes for general unstructured GKP codes, we give several examples of
structured GKP codes (i.e., of the repetition-rectangular GKP code types) where
the closest point decoding can be performed exactly in linear time. For the
surface-GKP code, we show that the closest point decoding can be performed
exactly in polynomial time with the help of a minimum-weight-perfect-matching
algorithm (MWPM). We show that this MWPM closest point decoder improves both
the fidelity and the noise threshold of the surface-GKP code to 0.602 compared

the range $0.5 < \alpha \leq 1$. An analytical solution is obtained in the
range of approximately $0.74 \leq \alpha < 1$, using a convergent power series

electromagnetic (EM) field, photons, in terms of monochromatic waves which have
a definite energy and momentum, and satisfy bosonic commutation relations.
Taking this approach, however, leads to several no-go theorems regarding the
localisability and superluminal propagation of single photons. Unfortunately,
without a local quantum description of the EM field it becomes difficult to
describe the specific dynamics of light in the presence of local interactions
or local boundary conditions.
  In this thesis we take an alternative approach and quantise the free EM field
in both one and three dimensions in terms of quanta that are perfectly
localised and propagate at the speed of light without dispersion. Our approach
has two characteristics that allow it to overcome earlier no-go theorems.
Firstly, we make a clear distinction between particles, which can always be
localised, and the electric and magnetic fields, which cannot; and secondly, we
remove the lower bound on the Hamiltonian, thereby introducing
negative-frequency photons from basic principles.
  Afterwards we test our quantisation scheme by studying the propagation of
light in a linear optics experiment analogous to that studied in Fermi's
two-atom problem. Here we show that, unlike standard quantisation schemes, our
approach predicts the causal propagation of localised photonic wave packets. We
also use our theory to provide a new perspective on the Casimir effect in both
one and three dimensions. In this part of the thesis we predict an attractive
force between two highly-reflecting metallic plates without having to invoke
regularisation procedures.

various training samples from random noises on the fly. Due to the simple yet
effective designs, the trained DiM can be directly applied to different
distillation ratios and large architectures without extra cost. We validate the

more frequently in recent years. The strong flux decrease in the soft X-ray
band between observations has been caused by clouds with large column densities
transiting our line-of-sight (LOS) and covering the central AGN. Another event
has been captured in NGC 3227 at the end of 2019. We aim to determine the
nature of the observed spectral variability in 2019 obscuration event. We split
the two XMM-Newton observations from 2019 into timing bins of length $\sim$ 10
ks. We used the SPEX code to analyse the 0.35-10 keV EPIC-PN spectra of each
timing bin. In the first observation (Obs 1), there is a strong
anti-correlation between the column density ($N_H$) of the obscurer and the
continuum normalisations of the X-ray power-law and soft Comptonisation
components ($N_{pow}$ and $N_{comt}$, respectively). The powerlaw continuum
models the hard X-rays produced by the corona, and the Comptonisation component
models the soft X-ray excess and emission from the accretion disk. Through
further testing we conclude that the continuum is likely to drive the observed
variability, but we cannot rule out a possible contribution from NH of the
obscurer if it fully transverses across the ionising source within our LOS
during the observation. The ionisation parameter ($\xi$) of the obscurer is not
easily constrained, and therefore it is not clear whether it varies in response
to changes in ionising continuum. The second observation (Obs 2) displays a
significantly lower count rate due to the combination of a high NH and covering
fraction of the obscurer, and a lower continuum flux. The observed variability
seen during the obscuration event of NGC 3227 in 2019 is likely driven by the

monitoring during daily life. These sensorized insoles need to be comfortable
and lightweight to be accepted. Previous work has already demonstrated that
sensorized insoles are possible and can estimate both ground reaction force and
gait cycle. However, these are often assemblies of commercial components
restricting design freedom and flexibility. Within this work, we investigate
the feasibility of using four 3D-printed porous (foam-like) piezoresistive
sensors embedded in a commercial insole. These sensors were evaluated using an
instrumented treadmill as the golden standard. It was observed that the four
sensors behaved in line with the expected change in pressure distribution
during the gait cycle. In addition, Hammerstein-Wiener models were identified
that were capable of estimating the vertical and mediolateral ground reaction
forces (GRFs). Their NRMSE fits were on average 82% and 73%, respectively.
Similarly, for the averaged gait cycle the R^2 values were 0.98 and 0.99 with
normalized RMS errors overall below 6%. These values were comparable with other
insoles based on commercial force sensing resistors but at a significantly
lower cost (over four times cheaper). Thereby indicating that our 3D-printed
sensors can be an interesting option for sensorized insoles. The advantage of
3D printing these sensors is that it allows for significantly more design
freedom, reduces assembly, and is cheaper. However, further research is needed
to exploit this design freedom for complex sensors, estimate the
anteroposterior GRF, and fully 3D print the entire insole.

UDG research is the study of similar galaxies at higher redshift to establish
how their properties may evolve over time. However, this has been a challenging
task given how severely cosmological surface brightness dimming inhibits our
ability to detect low-surface brightness galaxies at high-$z$. Here, we present
a sample of low stellar surface density galaxies (LDGs) at moderate redshift,
likely the progenitors of local UDGs, identified in deep near-IR {\it JWST}
observations of the El Gordo cluster at $z=0.87$. By stacking 8 NIRCAM filters,
reach an apparent surface brightness sensitivity of 24.59~mag~arcsec$^{-2}$,
faint enough to be complete to the bright end of the LDG population. Our
analysis identifies significant differences between this population and UDGs
observed locally, including differences in their color and size distributions,
which suggest that the UDG progenitors at high-$z$ are bluer and more extended
than UDGs at $z=0$. This suggests that multiple mechanisms are responsible for
UDG formation and that prolonged transformation of cluster dwarfs is not a
primary UDG formation mechanism at high-$z$. Furthermore, we find a slight
overabundance of LDGs in El Gordo, and, in contrast to findings in local
clusters, our analysis does not show a deficit of LDGs in the center of El
Gordo, implying that tidal destruction of LDGs is significant between $z=0.87$

  We run retrievals for simulated LIFE observations of a Venus-twin exoplanet
orbiting a Sun-like star located 10 pc from the observer. By assuming different
models (cloudy and cloud-free) we analyze the performance as a function of the
quality of the LIFE observation. This allows us to determine how well
atmosphere and clouds are characterizable depending on the quality of the
spectrum.
  Our study shows that the current minimal resolution ($R=50$) and
signal-to-noise ($S/N=10$ at $11.2\mu$m) requirements for LIFE suffice to
characterize the structure and composition of a Venus-like atmosphere above the
cloud deck if an adequate model is chosen. However, we cannot infer cloud
properties. The accuracy of the retrieved planet radius ($R_{pl}$), equilibrium
temperature ($T_{eq}$), and Bond albedo ($A_B$) depend on the choice of model.
Generally, a cloud-free model performs best and thus the presence of clouds
cannot be inferred. This model dependence of retrieval results emphasizes the
importance of developing a community-wide best-practice for atmospheric
retrieval studies. If we consider higher quality spectra (especially $S/N=20$),
we can infer the presence of clouds and pose first constraints on their
structure.

conjecture (1962) that the absolute values of the coefficients of the Alexander

SConv: a direct-convolution algorithm based on a MLIR/LLVM code-generation

algorithm introduces: (a) Convolution Slicing Analysis (CSA) - a
convolution-specific 3D cache-blocking analysis pass that focuses on tile reuse

optimized input-tensor packing solution based on vector-register shift
instructions for convolutions with unitary stride. Experiments conducted on 393
convolutions from full ONNX-MLIR machine-learning models indicate that the
elimination of the Im2Col transformation and the use of fast packing routines
result in a total packing time reduction, on full model inference, of 2.0x -
3.9x on Intel x86 and 3.6x - 7.2x on IBM POWER10. The speed-up over an Im2Col +

selective only for spin-coherence between singlet and triplet states, and it is
not in general selective for spin polarisation. We find that spin polarisation
selectivity only arises in hopping mediated electron transfer. We describe how
this effective spin-polarisation selectivity is a consequence of
spin-polarisation generated transiently in the intermediate state. The
recombination process also augments the coherent spin dynamics of the charge
separated state, which is found to have a significant effect on recombination
dynamics and to destroy any long-lived spin polarisation. Although we only

we observe solutions undergoing intermittent phases of contraction and

be mapped to disjoint regions of the breather parameter space, we find that
amplitude modulated solutions are located in the middle of both stability

generalizing to new concepts. Our approach is multimodal and

Text-to-Set (T2S) model to complete an approximate inversion and then optimize
a shared unconditional embedding to achieve accurate video inversion with a
small memory cost. For attention control, we introduce a novel
decoupled-guidance strategy, which uses different guidance strategies for the
source and target prompts. The optimized unconditional embedding for the source
prompt improves reconstruction ability, while an initialized unconditional
embedding for the target prompt enhances editability. Incorporating the
attention maps of these two branches enables detailed editing. These technical
designs enable various text-driven editing applications, including word swap,
prompt refinement, and attention re-weighting. Video-P2P works well on
real-world videos for generating new characters while optimally preserving
their original poses and scenes. It significantly outperforms previous
approaches.

extensible to new architectures. The framework uses a unified loop structure
and shared, cache-friendly data format across all intermediate layers,
eliminating the time and memory overheads incurred by data transformation
between layers. Layers are implemented by simply specifying the layer's
dimensions and a kernel -- the key computing operations of each layer. The
unified loop structure and kernel abstraction allows us to reuse code across
layers and computing platforms. New architectures only require the 100s of
lines in the kernel to be redesigned. To show the benefits of our approach, we
have developed software that supports a range of layer types and computing
platforms, which is easily extensible for rapidly instantiating high

to understand the effect of changing stellar wind magnetic field and planetary
magnetic field strengths on planetary magnetospheric topology and atmospheric
losses. It is observed that the relative strengths of stellar and planetary
magnetic fields play a significant role in determining the steady state
magnetospheric configuration and atmospheric erosion. When the stellar field is
strengthened or the planetary field is weakened, stellar magnetic field
accumulation occurs at the day-side of the planet which forces the magnetopause
to shift closer to its surface. The magnetotail opens up leading to the
formation of Alfv\'{e}n wings in the night-side wake region. We demonstrate how
reconnection processes and wind conditions lead to the bifurcation of the
magnetotail current sheet. With increasing stellar wind magnetic field
strength, the day-side reconnection point approaches the planet thereby
enhancing mass loss. We establish an analytic equation which successfully
captures the modeled mass-loss rate variations of planets with changing
magnetic field strengths. Our results are relevant for understanding how the
interplay of stellar and planetary magnetism influence (exo)planetary

$R(z)=(\Box-z\operatorname{Id})^{-1}$ of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $-\Box$
on $X$ can be extended meromorphically across the spectrum of $\Box$ as a
family of operators $C_c^\infty(X)\to \mathcal{D}'(X)$. Its poles are called
resonances and we determine them explicitly in all cases. For each resonance,
the image of the corresponding residue operator in $\mathcal{D}'(X)$ forms a
representation of the isometry group of $X$, which we identify with a
subrepresentation of a degenerate principal series. Our study includes in
particular the case of even functions on de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter spaces.
  For Riemannian symmetric spaces analogous results were obtained by
Miatello-Will and Hilgert-Pasquale. The main qualitative differences between
the Riemannian and the non-Riemannian setting are that for non-Riemannian
spaces the resolvent can have poles of order two, it can have a pole at the
branching point of the covering to which $R(z)$ extends, and the residue
representations can be infinite-dimensional.

traversal of extreme terrain, this work introduces 1) a proprioception-based
gait planner for estimating unknown hybrid events due to elevation changes and
responding by modifying contact schedules and planned footholds online, and 2)
a two-degree-of-freedom tail for improving contact-independent control and a
corresponding decoupled control scheme for better versatility and efficiency.
Simulation results show that the gait planner significantly improves stability
under unforeseen terrain height changes compared to methods that assume fixed
contact schedules and footholds. Further, testing shows the tail is most
effective at maintaining stability when encountering a terrain change with an
initial angular disturbance. The results show that these approaches work
synergistically to stabilize locomotion with elevation changes up to 1.5 times

more general dynamical systems attached to sequences of unicritical

  After having reduced the conjecture to the post-critically finite case, we
establish it for all polynomials with periodic critical orbit, over any number

present here the first single-pair Bell inequality test, able to obtain a Bell

exploiting sequential weak measurements, allowing to measure non-commuting

approach not only grants unprecedented measurement capability, but also removes
the need to choose between different measurement bases, intrinsically
eliminating the freedom-of-choice loophole and stretching the concept of
counterfactual-definiteness (since it allows measuring in the otherwise

important revisions of fundamental physics. However, the accuracy of the H0
measurement based on classical Cepheids has been challenged by a measurement
based on the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. A resolution of the
Cepheids vs. TRGB dispute is needed to demonstrate well understood systematics
and to corroborate the need for new physics. Here, we present an unprecedented
1.39% absolute calibration of the TRGB distance scale based on small-amplitude
red giant stars (OSARGs). Our results improve by 20% upon previous calibrations
and are limited by the accuracy of the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud.
This precision gain is enabled by the realization that virtually all stars at
the TRGB are variable - a fact not previously exploited for TRGB calibration.
Using observations and extensive simulations, we demonstrate that OSARGs yield
intrinsically precise and accurate TRGB measurements thanks to the shape of
their luminosity function. Inputting our calibration to the Carnegie Chicago
Hubble Program's H0 analysis yields a value of H0 = 71.8 +/- 1.5 km/s/Mpc, in <
1 sigma agreement with the Cepheids-based H0 value and in 2.8 sigma tension

this focus on locality is a useful inductive bias, it also impedes the learning

address this drawback, we propose Ewald message passing: a nonlocal Fourier
space scheme which limits interactions via a cutoff on frequency instead of
distance, and is theoretically well-founded in the Ewald summation method. It
can serve as an augmentation on top of existing MPNN architectures as it is
computationally inexpensive and agnostic to architectural details. We test the
approach with four baseline models and two datasets containing diverse periodic

energy mean absolute errors across all models and datasets, averaging 10% on
OC20 and 16% on OE62. Our analysis shows an outsize impact of these

wavefunction it can enable phenomena such as teleportation and thereby alter
the ""arrow of time"" that constrains unitary evolution. When integrated in
many-body dynamics, measurements can lead to emergent patterns of quantum
information in space-time that go beyond established paradigms for
characterizing phases, either in or out of equilibrium. On present-day NISQ
processors, the experimental realization of this physics is challenging due to
noise, hardware limitations, and the stochastic nature of quantum measurement.
Here we address each of these experimental challenges and investigate
measurement-induced quantum information phases on up to 70 superconducting
qubits. By leveraging the interchangeability of space and time, we use a
duality mapping, to avoid mid-circuit measurement and access different
manifestations of the underlying phases -- from entanglement scaling to
measurement-induced teleportation -- in a unified way. We obtain finite-size
signatures of a phase transition with a decoding protocol that correlates the
experimental measurement record with classical simulation data. The phases
display sharply different sensitivity to noise, which we exploit to turn an
inherent hardware limitation into a useful diagnostic. Our work demonstrates an
approach to realize measurement-induced physics at scales that are at the
limits of current NISQ processors.

  One goal of this new model is to provide a formal bridge between the model of

combinatorial theory of generalized species of structures. Our approach
consists in viewing finitary polynomial functors as analytic functors generated
by free generalized species.
  The main conceptual novelty is the notion of kit, designed to control the
extent to which species are free. We study kits from both combinatorial and
logical perspectives. Profunctors that respect the kit structure are called
stabilized, and the bicategory of stabilized profunctors gives rise to stable
species of structures, a cartesian closed bicategory that embeds finitary
polynomial functors.
  Stabilized profunctors and stable species can be given an extensional
presentation as certain functors between subcategories of presheaves determined

data (PU classification) with a selection bias in the positive data. During the
observation process, (i) a sample is exposed to a user, (ii) the user then
returns the label for the exposed sample, and (iii) we however can only observe
the positive samples. Therefore, the positive labels that we observe are a
combination of both the exposure and the labeling, which creates a selection
bias problem for the observed positive samples. This scenario represents a
conceptual framework for many practical applications, such as recommender
systems, which we refer to as ``learning from positive, unlabeled, and exposure
data'' (PUE classification). To tackle this problem, we initially assume access
to data with exposure labels. Then, we propose a method to identify the
function of interest using a strong ignorability assumption and develop an
``Automatic Debiased PUE'' (ADPUE) learning method. This algorithm directly
debiases the selection bias without requiring intermediate estimates, such as
the propensity score, which is necessary for other learning methods. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional PU
learning methods on various semi-synthetic datasets.

for constructing efficient fault-tolerant quantum memories. However, if
physical gates are subject to geometric-locality constraints, it becomes
challenging to realize these codes. In this paper, we construct a new family of
[[N,K,D]] codes, referred to as hierarchical codes, that encode a number of
logical qubits K = Omega(N/\log(N)^2). The N-th element of this code family is
obtained by concatenating a constant-rate quantum LDPC code with a surface
code; nearest-neighbor gates in two dimensions are sufficient to implement the
corresponding syndrome-extraction circuit and achieve a threshold. Below
threshold the logical failure rate vanishes superpolynomially as a function of
the distance D(N). We present a bilayer architecture for implementing the
syndrome-extraction circuit, and estimate the logical failure rate for this

Host galaxies and their satellites were identified using selection criteria

characterize the spatial distribution of the satellites, we adopt two
statistics: [1] the pairwise clustering of the satellites and [2] the Mean

tendency for satellites in the simulation to be located on the same side of
their host, and the signal is most pronounced for the satellites of blue hosts.
These lopsided satellite distributions are not solely attributable to
incompleteness of the observed satellite catalog or the presence of objects
that have been falsely identified as satellites. In addition, satellites that
joined their hosts' halos in the distant past (> 8 Gyr) show a pronounced
lopsidedness in their spatial distributions and, therefore, the lopsidedness is

drastically alter the local distribution of the Cosmic Neutrino Background
($C\nu B$). These structures have a shape reminiscent of a sea urchin: They
consist of rods of width $w$ and length $L \gg w$ periodically arranged on the
surface of sphere of radius $R\sim L$. Such a structure functions as a
diffraction phase grating and produces a region around its center where the
fractional neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry is $\sim k\delta_\nu L$, where $k$
is the neutrino momentum, and $\delta_\nu$ the deviation of the neutrino index
of refraction from unity. The asymmetry has a gradient set by the rod width.
  We find that the local neutrino asymmetry can be enhanced by
$\mathcal{O}(\text{few}\times 10^6)$ relative to the naive Standard Model
expectation, for reasonably sized structures. This results in a force
$\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ times bigger than the one we recently pointed out due to
the neutrinos' reflection on the surface of the Earth. While in this paper we
do not propose a concrete detection setup, we estimate that the
$\mathcal{O}(G_F)$ force on a test mass can be close to the Standard Quantum
Limit of a torsion balance or a low frequency harmonic oscillator.
  Finally, we show that this $C \nu B$ diffractor can be used as a Dark Matter
diffractor. For example, the QCD axion Dark Matter with decay constant $f_a$
around $10^9$ GeV can be sufficiently diffracted to produce a gradient force
that is up to $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times larger than the one from the $C \nu B$.
  This is the first setup of this kind and the simplicity of our design

signal in primordial scalar perturbations. Specifically, we find that, after
dCS amplifies one graviton helicity due to a tachyonic instability, the
graviton-mediated correlation between two pairs of scalars develops a
parity-odd component. This correlation, the primordial scalar trispectrum, is
then transferred to the corresponding curvature correlator and thus is
imprinted in both LSS and the CMB. We find that the parity-odd piece has
roughly the same amplitude as its parity-even counterpart, scaled linearly by
the degree of gravitational circular polarization $\Pi_{\rm circ} \sim
\sqrt{\varepsilon}[H^2/(M_{\rm Pl} f)] \leq 1$, with $\varepsilon$ the
slow-roll parameter, $H$ the inflationary Hubble scale, $f$ the dCS decay
constant, and the upper bound saturated for purely circularly-polarized
gravitons. We also find that, in the collapsed limit, the ratio of the two
trispectra contains direct information about the graviton's spin. In models
beyond standard inflationary dCS, e.g. those with multiple scalar fields or
superluminal scalar sound speed, there can be a large enhancement factor $F
\gtrsim 10^6$ to the trispectrum. We find that an LSS survey that contains
$N_{\rm modes}$ linear modes would place an $n\sigma$ constraint on $\Pi_{\rm
circ}r$ of $\sim 0.04\ (n/3)(10^6/F)(10^6/N_{\rm modes})^{1/2}$ from the
parity-odd galaxy trispectrum, for tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We also forecast
for several spectroscopic and 21-cm surveys. This constraint implies that, for
high-scale single-field inflation parameters, LSS can probe very large dCS
decay constants $f \lesssim 4\times 10^9\ {\rm GeV}(3/n)(F/10^6)\left(N_{\rm

particle yielding a parity-odd scalar trispectrum through spin-exchange.

physical observables are well approximated by familiar theories at frequencies

the Lorentz force law and the Larmor formula, which lay the foundation for
experimental tests of the photon's spin scale. We also reproduce known soft

matter currents are not fully localized to their worldlines when $\rho \neq 0$,
which motivates investigation of manifestly local completions of our theory.

pushing aside the intracluster medium (ICM). In this pilot study we present
results from ""pre-feedback"" clusters, where the central newly active radio
galaxies (age $<10^{3}$ yr) may not yet have had time to alter the
thermodynamic state of the ICM. We analyze $Chandra$ and MUSE observations of
two such systems, evaluating the hot gas entropy and cooling time profiles, and
characterizing the morphology and kinematics of the warm gas. Based on our
exploratory study of these two sources, we find that the hot gas meets the
expectations for an as-yet unheated ICM. Specifically, the entropy and cooling
time of pre-feedback clusters within 20 kpc from the center fall below those of
mature-feedback clusters by a factor $\sim$2. We speculate that with an
estimated mechanical power of $\sim10^{44} - 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the two
young radio galaxies may restore the entropy levels in a few tens of Myr, which
are typical values of power outbursts and lifetimes for radio galaxies in
clusters. Conversely, the properties of the gas at $\sim10^{4}$ K seem to
remain invariant between the two feedback stages, possibly suggesting that the
warm gas reservoir accumulates over long periods ($10^{7}$ - $10^{8}$ yr)

crucial in the context of understanding the onset of active galactic nuclei

charge gives a further obstruction beyond $c_-$ to gapping out the edge. In
this Letter, we show that the higher central charges can be characterized by
the expectation value of the \textit{partial rotation} operator acting on the
wavefunction of the topologically ordered state. This allows us to extract the
higher central charge from a single wavefunction, which can be evaluated on a
quantum computer. Our characterization of the higher central charge is
analytically derived from the modular properties of edge conformal field
theory, as well as the numerical results with the $\nu=1/2$ bosonic Laughlin
state and the non-Abelian gapped phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model, which
corresponds to $\mathrm{U}(1)_2$ and Ising topological order respectively. The
letter establishes a numerical method to obtain a set of obstructions to the
gappable edge of (2+1)D bosonic topological order beyond $c_-$. We also point
out that the expectation values of the partial rotation on a single
wavefunction put a constraint on the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary

sequences, necessary for the manipulation of the ideal qubit basis, that avoids
errors associated with excitations outside the computational subspace. A novel
control scheme manipulates the qubit adiabatically, while also retaining high
speed and ability to perform a general single-qubit rotation. This basis
generates spatially localized logical qubit states, making readout
straightforward. We consider experimentally realistic semiconductor qubits with
finite pulse rise and fall times and determine the fastest pulse sequence
yielding the highest fidelity. We show that our protocol leads to improved
control of a qubit. We present simulations of a double quantum dot in a

generalized to other physical systems since they depend only on pulse rise and

MBHs in tuples, we found that in $\sim 5\%$ of the triplets all three MBHs

theoretical approach presented here accounts for the non-trivial and
non-negligible impact such ion dissociation has on the measured cross sections
and distributions of the produced particles in the central detectors. This
builds on previous work, whereby the survival factor probability of no
additional inelastic ion-ion scattering due to the strong interaction, and its
kinematic impact, are also accounted for within the same overall framework. We
compare to data from ATLAS and CMS at the LHC, and STAR at RHIC, and find in
general encouraging agreement for a range of observables and ZDC neutron tags,
with some room for further improvement, suggesting the inclusion of higher

10$ and above, consistent with efficient conversion of the accreted gas into
stars, unlike the suppression of star formation by feedback at later times. We
show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch {\it
guarantee} a high star-formation efficiency (SFE) in the most massive
dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall
time is shorter than $\sim 1$ Myr, below the time for low-metallicity massive
stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic
density of $\sim 3\times 10^3$cm$^{-3}$. A comparable threshold density permits
a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall
time. The galaxies within $\sim 10^{11} M_\odot$ haloes at $z \sim 10$ are
expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by
cold streams in a halo crossing time $\sim 80$ Myr. The FFBs gradually turn all
the accreted gas into stars in clusters of $\sim 10^{4-7} M_\odot$ within
galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are
insensitive to radiative feedback and are shielded against feedback from
earlier stars. We predict high SFE above thresholds in redshift and halo mass,
where the density is $10^{3-4}$cm$^{-3}$. The $z\sim 10$ haloes of $\sim
10^{10.8} M_\odot$ are predicted to host galaxies of $\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$

$\leq 0.1 Z_\odot$ with little gas, dust, outflows and hot circumgalactic gas,

density profile. Simulation studies have suggested that shoulders are supported
by looped x1 orbits, are present in growing bars, and can appear after bar
buckling. Here we investigate the orbital support and evolution of shoulders
via frequency analyses of orbits in simulations. We confirm that looped orbits
are important to shoulders, and can remain so, to a lesser extent, after they
have been vertically thickened. We show that looped orbits are found at the
Inner Lindblad Resonance (ILR) with typical ratios of vertical to radial
frequencies $1 \lesssim\Omega_z/\Omega_R \lesssim 3/2$ ($\textit{warm}$ ILR).
$\textit{Cool}$ ILR orbits (those with $\Omega_z/\Omega_R > 3/2$), which are
vertically thin and have no loops, contribute negligibly to shoulders. As bars
slow and thicken, either secularly or by buckling, they populate warm ILR
orbits. Further thickening carries these orbits towards the vertical ILR (vILR)
at $\Omega_z/\Omega_R=1$, where they convert in-plane motion to vertical
motion, become chaotic, kinematically hotter and less shoulder-supporting.
Because of this heating by the vILR, persistent shoulders require bars to trap
new orbits, consistent with the need for a growing bar. Since buckling speeds
up the trapping of stars on warm ILR orbits, it can be followed by the
formation of shoulders, as seen in simulations. This evolutionary sequence
supports the recent observational finding that shoulder formation likely
precedes the emergence of BP-bulges. The python module used for the frequency
analysis, $\texttt{naif}$, is made publicly available.

initial state-dependence, decoherence, and thermalization. We first consider a
Gaussian initial state and quadratic influence functional and obtain general
equations for the Green's functions of the oscillator. We solve the equations
in the specific case of time-local dissipation and use the resulting Green's
functions to obtain the purity and unequal-time two-point correlations of the
oscillator. In particular, we find that the dynamics must include a
non-vanishing noise term to yield physical results. We show that the oscillator
decoheres in time such that the late-time density operator is thermal, and find
the parameter regime for which the fluctuation-dissipation relation is
satisfied. We next develop a double in-out path integral approach to go beyond
Gaussian initial states and show that our equal-time results are in fact

radiation fields than normal star-forming galaxies. The line luminosities agree
with the luminosity scaling relations across five orders of magnitude, although
the star-formation and gas surface density distributions (i.e.,

Milky Way values, with no apparent redshift evolution. Four of 46 sources

stars with rotation periods faster than 2 d are overwhelmingly binaries, with
typical separations of tens of AU; such binaries quickly clear their disks,
leading to a tendency for rapid rotators to be diskless. Among (nominally
single) stars with rotation periods slower than 2 d, we observe the familiar,
gyrochronological horseshoe-shaped relationship of rotation period versus
$T_{\rm eff}$, indicating that the processes which govern the universal
evolution of stellar rotation on Gyr timescales are already in place within the
first few Myr. Using spectroscopic $v\sin i$ we determine the distribution of
$\sin i$, revealing that the youngest stars are biased toward more pole-on
orientations, which may be responsible for the systematics between stellar mass
and age observed in star-forming regions. We are also able for the first time
to make empirical, quantitative measurements of angular momenta and their time
derivative as functions of stellar mass and age, finding these relationships to
be much simpler and monotonic as compared to the complex relationships
involving rotation period alone; evidently, the relationship between rotation
period and $T_{\rm eff}$ is largely a reflection of mass-dependent stellar
structure and not of angular momentum per se. Our measurements show that the
stars experience spin-down torques in the range ~$10^{37}$ erg at ~1 Myr to
~$10^{35}$ erg at ~10 Myr, which provide a crucial empirical touchstone for
theoretical mechanisms of angular momentum loss in young stars.

  International Conference on Robotics and Automation",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we develop a scalable, local trajectory optimization algorithm
that enables robots to interact with other robots. It has been shown that
agents' interactions can be successfully captured in game-theoretic
formulations, where the interaction outcome can be best modeled via the
equilibria of the underlying dynamic game. However, it is typically challenging
to compute equilibria of dynamic games as it involves simultaneously solving a
set of coupled optimal control problems. Existing solvers operate in a
centralized fashion and do not scale up tractably to multiple interacting
agents. We enable scalable distributed game-theoretic planning by leveraging
the structure inherent in multi-agent interactions, namely, interactions
belonging to the class of dynamic potential games. Since equilibria of dynamic
potential games can be found by minimizing a single potential function, we can
apply distributed and decentralized control techniques to seek equilibria of
multi-agent interactions in a scalable and distributed manner. We compare the
performance of our algorithm with a centralized interactive planner in a number
of simulation studies and demonstrate that our algorithm results in better
efficiency and scalability. We further evaluate our method in hardware
experiments involving multiple quadcopters.

edge-vertex decomposition, a concrete instance of modular decoding for
lattice-surgery style fault-tolerant blocks which is remarkably effective. This
decomposition of the global decoding problem into sub-tasks mirrors the
logical-block-network structure of a fault-tolerant quantum circuit. We
identify the buffering condition as a key requirement controlling decoder
quality; it demands a sufficiently large separation (buffer) between a
correction committed by a decoding sub-task and the data unavailable to it. We
prove that the fault distance of the protocol is preserved if the buffering
condition is satisfied. Finally, we implement edge-vertex modular decoding and
apply it on a variety of quantum circuits, including the Clifford component of
the 15-to-1 magic-state distillation protocol. Monte Carlo simulations on a
range of buffer sizes provide quantitative evidence that buffers are both
necessary and sufficient to guarantee decoder accuracy. Our results show that
modular decoding meets all the practical requirements necessary to support

a vital step in understanding the evolution of the solar corona into the solar

advanced predictions of this linkage for ongoing heliospheric missions, such as
Parker Solar Probe (PSP), is necessary for achieving useful coordinated remote
observations and maximizing scientific return. The general procedure for
estimating such connectivity is straightforward (i.e. magnetic field line
tracing in a coronal model) but validating the resulting estimates difficult
due to the lack of an independent ground truth and limited model constraints.
In its most recent orbits, PSP has reached perihelia of 13.3$R_\odot$ and
moreover travels extremely fast prograde relative to the solar surface,
covering over 120 degrees longitude in three days. Here we present footpoint
predictions and subsequent validation efforts for PSP Encounter 10, the first

strongly warped by mid-latitude or equatorial coronal holes. Lastly, we comment

learner for various important concept classes such as \textit{juntas}, and
\textit{half-spaces}. On the other hand, the second is preferable because of
its computational efficiency, which is linear in the sample size. However, PAC
learnability is still unknown as guarantees have been proved only under

  This paper resolves this problem for the junta class on the Boolean cube --
proving agnostic PAC learning of k-juntas using L2 polynomial regression.
Moreover, we present a new PAC learning algorithm based on the Boolean Fourier

machine learning systems. If undetected, they may impact the real-world
performance of such systems or will at least render original performance claims
invalid. In this paper, we focus on the detection of subgroup shifts, a type of
distribution shift that can occur when subgroups have a different prevalence
during validation compared to the deployment setting. For example, algorithms
developed on data from various acquisition settings may be predominantly
applied in hospitals with lower quality data acquisition, leading to an
inadvertent performance drop. We formulate subgroup shift detection in the
framework of statistical hypothesis testing and show that recent
state-of-the-art statistical tests can be effectively applied to subgroup shift
detection on medical imaging data. We provide synthetic experiments as well as
extensive evaluation on clinically meaningful subgroup shifts on histopathology
as well as retinal fundus images. We conclude that classifier-based subgroup
shift detection tests could be a particularly useful tool for post-market
surveillance of deployed ML systems.

  state-space modelling of heart rate dynamics","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent research is revealing how cognitive processes are supported by a
complex interplay between the brain and the rest of the body, which can be
investigated by the analysis of physiological features such as breathing
rhythms, heart rate, and skin conductance. Heart rate dynamics are of
particular interest as they provide a way to track the sympathetic and
parasympathetic outflow from the autonomic nervous system, which is known to
play a key role in modulating attention, memory, decision-making, and emotional
processing. However, extracting useful information from heartbeats about the
autonomic outflow is still challenging due to the noisy estimates that result
from standard signal-processing methods. To advance this state of affairs, we
propose a paradigm shift in how we conceptualise and model heart rate: instead
of being a mere summary of the observed inter-beat intervals, we introduce a
modelling framework that views heart rate as a hidden stochastic process that
drives the observed heartbeats. Moreover, by leveraging the rich literature of
state-space modelling and Bayesian inference, our proposed framework delivers a
description of heart rate dynamics that is not a point estimate but a posterior
distribution of a generative model. We illustrate the capabilities of our
method by showing that it recapitulates linear properties of conventional heart
rate estimators, while exhibiting a better discriminative power for metrics of
dynamical complexity compared across different physiological states.

observers (ZAMOs) define an absolute standard of non--rotation locally, as can
be verified by the absence of any Sagnac effect for these observers.
Nevertheless, we argue that on a global scale the only physically meaningful
concept is that of relative rotation. The argument is substantiated by solving
Einstein's equations for an approximate thin shell model where we keep a degree
of freedom by relaxing the natural assumption of vanishing rotation at
asymptotic infinity at the outset of the analysis. The solution reveals that
Einstein's equations only determine differences in the rotation rate of ZAMOs,
thereby establishing the concept of relative rotation globally. The
interpretation of rotation as relative in a global context is inherently linked
to the freedom to transform between coordinate systems rotating relative to
each other, implying that an arbitrary ZAMO located at any radius may claim to
be the one who is non--rotating on a global scale and that the notion of an
asymptotic Lorentz frame relative to which one may measure absolute rotation is
devoid of any meaning. The concept of rotation in Kerr spacetime is then
briefly discussed in the context of this interpretation.

controlling the optoelectronic properties of materials in general.
Specifically, by realizing different off-stochiometric La3-xTe4 compounds, it

studies predicted that non-coplanar antiferromagnetic order with finite scalar
spin chirality (i.e. solid angle spanned by neighboring spins) can often induce
large spontaneous Hall effect even without net magnetization or external
magnetic field. This phenomenon, i.e. spontaneous topological Hall effect, can
potentially be used for the efficient electrical readout of the
antiferromagnetic states, but its experimental verification has long been
elusive due to the lack of appropriate materials hosting such exotic magnetism.
Here, we report the discovery of all-in-all-out type non-coplanar
antiferromagnetic order in triangular lattice compounds CoTa3S6 and CoNb3S6, by
performing the detailed magnetic structure analysis based on polarized neutron
scattering experiments as well as systematic first-principles calculations.
These compounds are reported to host unconventionally large spontaneous Hall
effect despite their vanishingly small net magnetization, and our analysis
revealed that it can be well explained in terms of topological Hall effect,
which originates from the fictitious magnetic field associated with scalar spin
chirality in non-coplanar antiferromagnetic orders. The present results
indicate that the scalar spin chirality mechanism can offer a promising route
to realize giant spontaneous Hall response even in compensated
antiferromagnets, and highlight intercalated van der Waals magnets as an unique

addressing the issues of shortage and high costs in labor. One key technology
to fully enable efficient automated harvesting is accurate and robust apple
detection, which is challenging due to complex orchard environments that
involve varying lighting conditions and foliage/branch occlusions. Furthermore,
clustered apples are common in the orchard, which brings additional challenges
as the clustered apples may be identified as one apple. This will cause issues
in localization for subsequent robotic operations. In this paper, we present
the development of a novel deep learning-based apple detection framework,
Occluder-Occludee Relational Network (O2RNet), for robust detection of apples
in such clustered environments. This network exploits the occuluder-occludee
relationship modeling head by introducing a feature expansion structure to
enable the combination of layered traditional detectors to split clustered
apples and foliage occlusions. More specifically, we collect a comprehensive
apple orchard image dataset under different lighting conditions (overcast,
front lighting, and back lighting) with frequent apple occlusions. We then
develop a novel occlusion-aware network for apple detection, in which a feature
expansion structure is incorporated into the convolutional neural networks to
extract additional features generated by the original network for occluded
apples. Comprehensive evaluations are performed, which show that the developed
O2RNet outperforms state-of-the-art models with a higher accuracy of 94\% and a
higher F1-score of 0.88 on apple detection.

  Dwarf","24 pages, 23 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to AAS Journals",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Brown dwarf spectra offer vital testbeds for our understanding of the
chemical and physical processes that sculpt substellar atmospheres. Recently,
atmospheric retrieval approaches have been applied to a number of
low-resolution (R~100) spectra of brown dwarfs, yielding constraints on the
abundances of chemical species and temperature structures of these atmospheres.
Medium-resolution (R~1e3) spectra of brown dwarfs offer significant additional
insight, as molecular features are more easily disentangled from one another
and the thermal structure of the upper atmosphere is more readily probed. We
present results from a GPU-based retrieval analysis of a high signal-to-noise,
medium-resolution (R~6000) FIRE spectrum from 0.85-2.5 microns of a T9 dwarf.
At 60x higher spectral resolution than previous brown dwarf retrievals, a
number of novel challenges arise. We examine the strong effect of different
opacity sources on our retrieved constraints, in particular for CH4.
Furthermore, we find that flaws in the data such as errors from order stitching
can greatly bias our results. We compare these results to those obtained for a
R~100 spectrum of the same object, revealing how constraints on atmospheric
abundances and temperatures improve by an order of magnitude or more (depending
on the species) with increased spectral resolution. In particular, we precisely
constrain the abundance of H2S, which is undetectable at lower spectral
resolution. While these medium-resolution retrievals offer the potential of
precise, stellar-like constraints on atmospheric abundances (~0.02 dex), our
retrieved radius is unphysically small (R~0.50 R$_{Jup}$), indicating lingering
shortcomings with our modeling framework. This work is an initial investigation
into brown dwarf retrievals at medium spectral resolution, offering guidance
for future ground-based studies and JWST observations of substellar objects.

collaboratively train a model without sharing the local data. However, the
presence of heterogeneous devices in federated learning, such as mobile phones

hence the performance of the model could be trained. The mainstream approaches
to address memory limitations focus on width-slimming techniques, where
different clients train subnetworks with reduced widths locally and then the
server aggregates the subnetworks. The global model produced from these methods
suffers from performance degradation due to the negative impact of the actions
taken to handle the varying subnetwork widths in the aggregation phase. In this
paper, we introduce a memory-adaptive depth-wise learning solution in FL called
FeDepth, which adaptively decomposes the full model into blocks according to
the memory budgets of each client and trains blocks sequentially to obtain a
full inference model. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches,
achieving 5% and more than 10% improvements in top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 and

cell phenotypes), identifying control interventions that can drive a system
towards its attractors (attractor control) is of particular relevance when
controlling biological systems. Driving a network's feedback vertex set (FVS)
by node-state override into a state consistent with a target attractor is
proven to force every system trajectory to the target attractor, but in
biological networks, the FVS is typically larger than can be realistically
manipulated. External control of a subset of a biological network's FVS was
proposed as a strategy to drive the network to its attractors utilizing fewer
interventions; however, the effectiveness of this strategy was only
demonstrated on a small set of Boolean models of biological networks. Here, we
extend this analysis to ensembles of biologically-inspired Boolean networks. On
these models, we use three structural metrics -- PRINCE propagation, modified
PRINCE propagation, and CheiRank -- to rank FVS subsets by their predicted
attractor control strength. We validate the accuracy of these rankings using
three dynamical measures: To Control, Away Control, and logical domain of
influence. We also calculate the propagation metrics on effective graphs, which
incorporate each Boolean model's functional information into edge weights.
While this additional information increases the predicting power of structural
metrics, we find that the increase with respect to the unweighted network is
limited. The propagation metrics in conjunction with the FVS can be used to
identify realizable driver node sets by emulating the dynamics that are
prevalent in biological networks. This approach only uses the network's
structure, and the driver sets are shown to be robust to the specific dynamical
model.

the validation criteria for effective two-body scattering and establish a

plays a critical role in assuring vehicle safety and mission success. A cheap

touchdown. Plagued by resource constraints and limited computational power,
traditional techniques for visual hazardous terrain detection focus on template
matching and registration to pre-built hazard maps. Although successful on
previous missions, this approach is restricted to the specificity of the
templates and limited by the fidelity of the underlying hazard map, which both
require extensive pre-flight cost and effort to obtain and develop. Terrestrial
systems that perform a similar task in applications such as autonomous driving
utilize state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to successfully localize and

accelerating deep learning inference enable the application of these methods in
space for the first time. In this work, we introduce You Only Crash Once

classification technique for autonomous spacecraft planetary landings. Through
the use of unsupervised domain adaptation we tailor YOCO for training by

mission surveying phases. We further improve the transfer of representative
terrain knowledge between simulation and the real world through visual
similarity clustering. We demonstrate the utility of YOCO through a series of

substantial improvements toward the ability to both detect and accurately
classify instances of planetary terrain.

The numerical evidence suggests that the maximum growth factor is bigger than

nearly equal to the maximum growth factor over all real matrices. We also show
that the growth factors under floating point arithmetic and exact arithmetic
are nearly identical. Finally, through numerical search, and stability and
extrapolation results, we provide improved lower bounds for the maximum growth
factor. Specifically, we find that the largest growth factor is bigger than
$1.0045n$, and the lim sup of the ratio with $n$ is greater than or equal to

shifting in the position of the tricritical point. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that an ensemble of non-interacting photo-ferroelectric NPs may exhibit
superparaelectric-like features at the tricritical point, such as strongly
frequency-dependent giant piezoelectric and dielectric responses, which can
potentially be exploited for piezoelectric applications.

Even challenging parameters such as contrast agent type can be predicted with

environments with continuous states and actions, long task horizons, and sparse

form of state abstraction because of their compatibility with symbolic planners
and their capacity for relational generalization. However, to plan with
predicates, the agent must be able to interpret them in continuous environment
states (i.e., ground the symbols). Manually programming predicate
interpretations can be difficult, so we would instead like to learn them from
data. We propose an embodied active learning paradigm where the agent learns
predicate interpretations through online interaction with an expert. For
example, after taking actions in a block stacking environment, the agent may
ask the expert: ""Is On(block1, block2) true?"" From this experience, the agent
learns to plan: it learns neural predicate interpretations, symbolic planning
operators, and neural samplers that can be used for bilevel planning. During
exploration, the agent plans to learn: it uses its current models to select
actions towards generating informative expert queries. We learn predicate
interpretations as ensembles of neural networks and use their entropy to
measure the informativeness of potential queries. We evaluate this approach in
three robotic environments and find that it consistently outperforms six
baselines while exhibiting sample efficiency in two key metrics: number of

effect is assumed to follow a continuous probability distribution. However, in
some areas of application, a discrete frailty distribution may be more
appropriate. We investigate and compare various existing families of discrete
univariate and shared frailty models by taking as our focus the variance of the
relative frailty distribution in survivors. The relative frailty variance (RFV)
among survivors provides a readily interpretable measure of how the
heterogeneity of a population, as represented by a frailty model, evolves over
time. We explore the shape of the RFV for the purpose of model selection and
review available discrete random effect distributions in this context. We find
non-monotone trajectories of the RFV for discrete univariate and shared frailty
models, which is a rare property. Furthermore, we proof that for discrete
time-invariant univariate and shared frailty models with (without) an atom at
zero, the limit of the RFV approaches infinity (zero), if the support of the
discrete distribution can be arranged in ascending order. Through the
one-to-one relationship of the RFV with the cross-ratio function in shared
frailty models, which we generalize to the higher-variate case, our results
also apply to patterns of association within a cluster. Extensions and
contrasts to discrete time-varying frailty models and contrasts to correlated
discrete frailty models are discussed.

requirements on precision are so intense that effects formerly thought too
small to matter are now relevant. This article is a brief review of personal
efforts to include the effects of strong interactions on Fermi $\beta $ decay.
First I examine the role of isospin violation in the decay of the neutron. The
size of the necessary correction depends upon detailed strong-interaction
dynamics. The isospin violating parts of the nucleon wave function, important
at the low energy of $\beta$ decay, can be constrained by data taken at much
higher energies, via measurements, for example, of $ed\to e'\pi^\pm +\rm X $
reactions at Jefferson Laboratory. The next focus is on the role of nuclear
short-ranged correlations, which affect the value of the correction needed to
account for isospin violation in extracting the value of $V_{ud}$. The net
result is that effects previously considered as irrelevant have become relevant
for both neutron and nuclear $\beta$ decay.

However trait-mediated or behavioral indirect interactions can both reinforce

competitive ODE and PDE systems where an Allee effect, which is a density
dependent process and the fear effect, which is non-consumptive and behavioral
are both present. The stability of the equilibria is discussed analytically
using the qualitative theory of ordinary differential equations. It is found
that the Allee effect and the fear effect change the extinction dynamics of the
system and the number of positive equilibrium points, but they do not affect
the stability of the positive equilibria. We also observe some special dynamics
that induce bifurcations in the system by varying the Allee or fear parameter.
Interestingly we find that the Allee effect working in conjunction with the
fear effect, can bring about several qualitative changes to the dynamical
behavior of the system with only the fear effect in place, in regimes of small
fear. That is, for small amounts of the fear parameter, it can change a
competitive exclusion type situation to a strong competition type situation. It
can also change a weak competition type situation to a bi-stability type
situation. However for large fear regimes the Allee effect reinforces the
dynamics driven by the fear effect. The analysis of the corresponding spatially
explicit model is also presented. To this end the comparison principle for
parabolic PDE is used. The conclusions of this paper have strong implications

attract intense research interest in intertwined topology, superconductivity,

studied, its out-of-plane structural correlation with the Fermi surface
properties is less understood. In this work, we advance the theoretical
description of quantum oscillations and investigate the Fermi surface
properties in the three-dimensional CDW phase of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We derived
Fermi-energy-resolved and layer-resolved quantum orbits that agree
quantitatively with recent experiments in the fundamental frequency, cyclotron
mass, and topology. We reveal a complex Dirac nodal network that would lead to
a $\pi$ Berry phase of a quantum orbit in the spinless case. However, the phase
shift of topological quantum orbits is contributed by the orbital moment and
Zeeman effect besides the Berry phase in the presence of spin-orbital coupling
(SOC). Therefore, we can observe topological quantum orbits with a $\pi$ phase
shift in otherwise trivial orbits without SOC, contrary to common perception.
Our work reveals the rich topological nature of kagome materials and paves a
path to resolve different topological origins of quantum orbits.

parallel SCC is increasingly important. SCC is challenging in the parallel
setting and is particularly hard on large-diameter graphs. Many existing
parallel SCC implementations can be even slower than Tarjan's sequential
algorithm on large-diameter graphs.
  To tackle this challenge, we propose an efficient parallel SCC implementation
using a new parallel reachability algorithm. Our solution is based on a novel
idea referred to as vertical granularity control (VGC). It breaks the
synchronization barriers to increase parallelism and hide scheduling overhead.
To use VGC in our SCC algorithm, we also design an efficient data structure
called the \emph{parallel hash bag}. It uses parallel dynamic resizing to avoid
redundant work in maintaining frontiers (vertices processed in a round).
  We implement the parallel SCC algorithm by Blelloch et al.\ (J.\ ACM, 2020)
using our new parallel reachability algorithm. We compare our implementation to
the state-of-the-art systems, including GBBS, iSpan, Multi-step, and our highly

(GBBS), 12.8$\times$ faster than Tarjan's sequential algorithms, and
2.7$\times$ faster than the \emph{best existing implementation on each graph}.
  We believe that our techniques are of independent interest. We also apply our

unexplainable manner, which overlook the relationship between internal units of
the model and the target class, thereby leading to inferior performance. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a novel explainable pruning framework dubbed
X-Pruner, which is designed by considering the explainability of the pruning

predicting each target class, a novel explainability-aware mask is proposed and
learned in an end-to-end manner. Then, to preserve the most informative units
and learn the layer-wise pruning rate, we adaptively search the layer-wise
threshold that differentiates between unpruned and pruned units based on their
explainability-aware mask values. To verify and evaluate our method, we apply
the X-Pruner on representative transformer models including the DeiT and Swin

Therefore, accurate and automatic segmentation of optic disc (OD) and optic cup

CNN-based segmentation frameworks resort to building deep encoders with
aggressive downsampling layers, which suffer from a general limitation on
modeling explicit long-range dependency. To this end, in this paper, we propose
a new segmentation pipeline, called UT-Net, availing the advantages of U-Net

bilinear fusion scheme. In addition to this, we incorporate Multi-Head
Contextual attention to enhance the regular self-attention used in traditional
vision transformers. Thus low-level features along with global dependencies are
captured in a shallow manner. Besides, we extract context information at
multiple encoding layers for better exploration of receptive fields, and to aid
the model to learn deep hierarchical representations. Finally, an enhanced
mixing loss is proposed to tightly supervise the overall learning process. The
proposed model has been implemented for joint OD and OC segmentation on three
publicly available datasets: DRISHTI-GS, RIM-ONE R3, and REFUGE. Additionally,
to validate our proposal, we have performed exhaustive experimentation on
Glaucoma detection from all three datasets by measuring the Cup to Disc Ratio

strongly correlated with the number of parameters packed into these networks.
However, the complexity barrier for human understanding, is arguably related to

nonlinear transformations. In this paper we show that the use of biophysical
synapses, as found in LTCs, have two main benefits. First, they allow to pack
more parameters for a given number of neurons and synapses. Second, they allow
to formulate the nonlinear-network transformation, as a linear system with
state-dependent coefficients. Both increase interpretability, as for a given

Identifying and constructing the pretty good measurement for the class of

measurement of a Gaussian ensemble in a multimode bosonic system is a Gaussian
measurement that attains the accessible information of the ensemble (IEEE

the lattice parameters and the volume of the unit cell when the material is
thermally cooled. The NTE is typically associated with thermal phonons and
anomalous spin-lattice coupling at low temperatures. However, the underlying
mechanisms in the presence of strong electron correlations in multi-orbital
systems are not yet fully established. Here, we investigate the role of Coulomb
interaction in the presence of lattice distortions in setting out the NTE
effect, by focusing on the physical case of layered Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ with $d^4$
configuration at each Ru ion site. We employ the Slater-Koster parametrization
to describe the electron-lattice coupling through the dependence of the $d-p$
hybridization on the Ru-O-Ru bond angle. The evaluation of the minimum of the
free energy at finite temperature by fully solving the multi-orbital many-body
problem on finite size cluster allows us to identify the regime for which the
system is prone to exhibit NTE effects. The analysis shows that the nature of
the spin-orbital correlations is relevant to drive the reduction of the bond
angle by cooling, and in turn the tendency toward a NTE. This is confirmed by
the fact that a changeover of the electronic and orbital configuration from
$d^4$ to $d^3$ by transition metal substitution is shown to favor the
occurrence of NTE in Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. This finding is in agreement with the
experimental observations of a NTE effect which is significantly dependent on
the transition metal substitution in the Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ compound.

chemical evolution history of a galaxy: age-divided mean stellar populations
(ADPs) from full spectrum fitting. In this method, the mass-weighted mean
stellar populations and mass fractions (f_mass) of young and old stellar
components in a galaxy are separately estimated, which are divided with an age
cut (selected to be 10^9.5 yr ~ 3.2 Gyr in this paper). To examine the
statistical reliability of ADPs, we generate 10,000 artificial galaxy spectra,
each of which consists of five random simple stellar population components.
Using the Penalized PiXel-Fitting (pPXF) package, we conduct full spectrum
fitting to the artificial spectra with noise as a function of wavelength,
imitating the real noise of Sydney-Australian Astronomical Observatory
Multi-object Integral field spectrograph (SAMI) galaxies. As a result, the
\Delta (= output - input) of age and metallicity appears to significantly
depend on not only signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), but also luminosity fractions
(f_lum) of young and old components. At given S/N and f_lum, \Delta of young
components tends to be larger than \Delta of old components; e.g.,
\sigma(\Delta [M/H]) ~ 0.40 versus 0.23 at S/N = 30 and f_lum = 50 per cent.
The age-metallicity degeneracy appears to be insignificant, but \Delta
log(age/yr) shows an obvious correlation with \Delta f_mass for young stellar
components (R ~ 0.6). The impact of dust attenuation and emission lines appears
to be mostly insignificant. We discuss how this methodology can be applied to
spectroscopic studies of the formation histories of galaxies, with a few
examples of SAMI galaxies.

societal impact of AI. These concerns arise from the need for huge amounts of
data to train deep neural networks. A promise of Generalized Few-shot Object
Detection (G-FSOD), a learning paradigm in AI, is to alleviate the need for
collecting abundant training samples of novel classes we wish to detect by
leveraging prior knowledge from old classes (i.e., base classes). G-FSOD
strives to learn these novel classes while alleviating catastrophic forgetting
of the base classes. However, existing approaches assume that the base images
are accessible, an assumption that does not hold when sharing and storing data
is problematic. In this work, we propose the first data-free knowledge
distillation (DFKD) approach for G-FSOD that leverages the statistics of the
region of interest (RoI) features from the base model to forge instance-level
features without accessing the base images. Our contribution is three-fold: (1)
we design a standalone lightweight generator with (2) class-wise heads (3) to
generate and replay diverse instance-level base features to the RoI head while
finetuning on the novel data. This stands in contrast to standard DFKD
approaches in image classification, which invert the entire network to generate
base images. Moreover, we make careful design choices in the novel finetuning
pipeline to regularize the model. We show that our approach can dramatically
reduce the base memory requirements, all while setting a new standard for
G-FSOD on the challenging MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC benchmarks.

`non-quantumness' of a state, suitably defined, changes with time. We find that
it remains constant in time even under non-trivial dynamics, and argue that

Under review",,,,"stat.AP math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  NBA team managers and owners try to acquire high-performing players. An
important consideration in these decisions is how well the new players will
perform in combination with their teammates. Our objective is to identify elite
five-person lineups, which we define as those having a positive plus-minus per
minute (PMM). Using individual player order statistics, our model can identify
an elite lineup even if the five players in the lineup have never played
together, which can inform player acquisition decisions, salary negotiations,
and real-time coaching decisions. We combine seven classification tools into a
unanimous consent classifier (all-or-nothing classifier, or ANC) in which a
lineup is predicted to be elite only if all seven classifiers predict it to be
elite. In this way, we achieve high positive predictive value (i.e.,
precision), the likelihood that a lineup classified as elite will indeed have a
positive PMM. We train and test the model on individual player and lineup data
from the 2017-18 season and use the model to predict the performance of lineups
drawn from all 30 NBA teams' 2018-19 regular season rosters. Although the ANC
is conservative and misses some high-performing lineups, it achieves high
precision and recommends positionally balanced lineups.

different cuts, we manage to isolate the contribution of $u$-started FFs. Then,
we relate the ratios of the $z$-spectrum for pion and kaon production, with the
corresponding FFs ratios. The methodology described in this article can be used
to relate FFs for any pair of hadrons, and could be further explored to keep
track of the flavour of the partons undergoing the hadronization.

computational theories of the brain, where they prescribe a general algorithm
for inference and learning over hierarchical latent probabilistic models.
Despite this, they have enjoyed little export to the broader field of machine
learning, where comparative generative modelling techniques have flourished. In
part, this has been due to the poor performance of models trained with PC when
evaluated by both sample quality and marginal likelihood. By adopting the
perspective of PC as a variational Bayes algorithm under the Laplace
approximation, we identify the source of these deficits to lie in the exclusion
of an associated Hessian term in the PC objective function, which would
otherwise regularise the sharpness of the probability landscape and prevent
over-certainty in the approximate posterior. To remedy this, we make three
primary contributions: we begin by suggesting a simple Monte Carlo estimated
evidence lower bound which relies on sampling from the Hessian-parameterised
variational posterior. We then derive a novel block diagonal approximation to
the full Hessian matrix that has lower memory requirements and favourable
mathematical properties. Lastly, we present an algorithm that combines our
method with standard PC to reduce memory complexity further. We evaluate models
trained with our approach against the standard PC framework on image benchmark

solution in the control loop, the flow rates that are required to steer the
drops toward their respective target points can be determined using a single
control parameter. This parameter, $ \chi^{*} $, is a dimensionless time scale
that can manipulate the drops in one of the two manners: 1) by engaging all six
ports to create a flow field with two stagnation points ($ \chi^{*}\ll1 $), or
2) by deactivating some of the ports and creating a linear extensional flow
through the remaining active ports ($ \chi^{*}\gg1 $). We determine specific
orientations that are more suitable for the collision of Hele-Shaw drops in the

this group of workers is under-explored in the HCI community. To fill this gap,
we conducted semi-structured interviews with 26 safety drivers. Our results
present how safety drivers cope with defective algorithms and shape and
calibrate their perceptions while working with AV. We found that, as front-line
workers, safety drivers are forced to take risks accumulated from the AV
industry upstream and are also confronting restricted self-development in
working for AV development. We contribute the first empirical evidence of the

interact with the world. Despite remarkable progress, existing methods often
struggle to generate plausible hand poses when the hand is heavily occluded or
blurred. In videos, the movements of the hand allow us to observe various parts
of the hand that may be occluded or blurred in a single frame. To adaptively
leverage the visual clue before and after the occlusion or blurring for robust
hand pose estimation, we propose the Deformer: a framework that implicitly
reasons about the relationship between hand parts within the same image
(spatial dimension) and different timesteps (temporal dimension). We show that
a naive application of the transformer self-attention mechanism is not
sufficient because motion blur or occlusions in certain frames can lead to
heavily distorted hand features and generate imprecise keys and queries. To
address this challenge, we incorporate a Dynamic Fusion Module into Deformer,
which predicts the deformation of the hand and warps the hand mesh predictions
from nearby frames to explicitly support the current frame estimation.
Furthermore, we have observed that errors are unevenly distributed across
different hand parts, with vertices around fingertips having disproportionately
higher errors than those around the palm. We mitigate this issue by introducing
a new loss function called maxMSE that automatically adjusts the weight of
every vertex to focus the model on critical hand parts. Extensive experiments
show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10%,

algorithm of the fast TDBEM is a time-domain variant of the interpolation-based

principle of the present IFMM is to interpolate the kernel functions of the

that every kernel function is expressed in a form of separation of variables in
terms of both the spatial and temporal variables. Such an expression enables to

Meanwhile, the transitions between the two states are often observed. In this
paper, we re-investigate the transition luminosities in the framework of the
self-similar solution of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF).
Specifically, we search for the critical mass accretion rate $\dot m_{\rm
crit}$ of ADAF for different radii $r$ respectively. It is found that $\dot
m_{\rm crit}$ decreases with decreasing $r$. By testing the effects of BH mass
$m$, the magnetic parameter $\beta$ and the viscosity parameter $\alpha$, it is
found that only $\alpha$ has significant effects on $\dot m_{\rm crit}-r$
relation. We define the minimum $\dot m_{\rm crit}$ (roughly at the innermost
stable circular orbit) as the hard-to-soft transition rate $\dot m_{\rm tr:
H\rightarrow S}$, above which BH will gradually transit from the low/hard state
to the high/soft state, and $\dot m_{\rm crit}$ at $30$ Schwarzschild radii as
the soft-to-hard transition rate $\dot m_{\rm tr: S\rightarrow H}$, below which
BH will gradually transit from the high/soft state to the low/hard state. We
derive fitting formulae of $\dot m_{\rm tr: H\rightarrow S}$ and $\dot m_{\rm
tr: S\rightarrow H}$ as functions of $\alpha$ respectively. By comparing with
observations, it is found that the mean value of $\alpha$ are $\alpha \sim
0.85$ and $\alpha \sim 0.33$ for the hard-to-soft transition and the
soft-to-hard transition respectively, which indicates that two classes of
$\alpha$ are needed for explaining the hysteresis effect during the state
transition. Finally, we argue that such a constrained $\alpha$ may provide
valuable clues for further exploring the accretion physics in BH-XRBs.

a training framework, SSL2 (self-supervised-semi-supervised), for
multi-modality MS lesion segmentation with limited supervision. We adopt
self-supervised learning to leverage the knowledge from large public 3T
datasets to tackle the limitations of a small 7T target dataset. To leverage
the information from unlabeled 7T data, we also evaluate state-of-the-art
semi-supervised methods for other limited annotation settings, such as small
labeled training size and sparse annotations. We use the shifted-window (Swin)
transformer1 as our backbone network. The effectiveness of self-supervised and
semi-supervised training strategies is evaluated in our in-house 7T MRI
dataset. The results indicate that each strategy improves lesion segmentation
for both limited training data size and for sparse labeling scenarios. The
combined overall framework further improves the performance substantially
compared to either of its components alone. Our proposed framework thus
provides a promising solution for future data/label-hungry 7T MS studies.

image encryption methods proposed for privacy-preserving deep learning. Various
learnable encryption methods have been studied to protect the sensitive visual
information of plain images, and some of them have been investigated to be
robust enough against all existing attacks. However, previous attacks on image
encryption focus only on traditional cryptanalytic attacks or reverse
translation models, so these attacks cannot recover any visual information if a
block-scrambling encryption step, which effectively destroys global
information, is applied. Accordingly, in this paper, generative models are
explored to evaluate whether such models can restore sensitive visual
information from encrypted images for the first time. We first point out that
encrypted images have some similarity with plain images in the embedding space.
By taking advantage of leaked information from encrypted images, we propose a
guided generative model as an attack on learnable image encryption to recover
personally identifiable visual information. We implement the proposed attack in
two ways by utilizing two state-of-the-art generative models: a StyleGAN-based
model and latent diffusion-based one. Experiments were carried out on the
CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Results show that images reconstructed by the
proposed method have perceptual similarities to plain images.

elements with different attributes including category, size, position, and
between-element relation. It is a crucial task for reducing the burden on
heavy-duty graphic design works for formatted scenes, e.g., publications,
documents, and user interfaces (UIs). Diverse application scenarios impose a
big challenge in unifying various layout generation subtasks, including
conditional and unconditional generation. In this paper, we propose a Layout
Diffusion Generative Model (LDGM) to achieve such unification with a single
decoupled diffusion model. LDGM views a layout of arbitrary missing or coarse
element attributes as an intermediate diffusion status from a completed layout.
Since different attributes have their individual semantics and characteristics,
we propose to decouple the diffusion processes for them to improve the
diversity of training samples and learn the reverse process jointly to exploit
global-scope contexts for facilitating generation. As a result, our LDGM can
generate layouts either from scratch or conditional on arbitrary available
attributes. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate our
proposed LDGM outperforms existing layout generation models in both
functionality and performance.

  Depth Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, monocular depth estimation (MDE) has gained significant
progress in a data-driven learning fashion. Previous methods can infer depth
maps for specific domains based on the paradigm of single-domain or
joint-domain training with mixed data. However, they suffer from low
scalability to new domains. In reality, target domains often dynamically change
or increase, raising the requirement of incremental multi-domain/task learning.
In this paper, we seek to enable lifelong learning for MDE, which performs
cross-domain depth learning sequentially, to achieve high plasticity on a new
domain and maintain good stability on original domains. To overcome significant
domain gaps and enable scale-aware depth prediction, we design a lightweight
multi-head framework that consists of a domain-shared encoder for feature
extraction and domain-specific predictors for metric depth estimation.
Moreover, given an input image, we propose an efficient predictor selection
approach that automatically identifies the corresponding predictor for depth
inference. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that the proposed
method can achieve good efficiency, stability, and plasticity, leading the
benchmarks by 8% to 15%.

observation of SN 2021hpr in a spiral galaxy, NGC 3147, and constraints on the
progenitor system based on its early multi-color light curve data. First, we
classify SN 2021hpr as a normal SN Ia from its long-term photometric and
spectroscopic data. More interestingly, we found a significant ""early excess""
in the light curve over a simple power-law $\sim t^{2}$ evolution. The early
light curve evolves from blue to red and blue during the first week. To explain
this, we fitted the early part of $BVRI$-band light curves with a two-component
model of the ejecta-companion interaction and a simple power-law model. The
early excess and its color can be explained by shock cooling emission due to a
companion star having a radius of $8.84\pm0.58$$R_{\odot}$. We also examined
HST pre-explosion images with no detection of a progenitor candidate,
consistent with the above result. However, we could not detect signs of a
significant amount of the stripped mass from a non-degenerate companion star
($\lesssim0.003\,M_{\odot}$ for H$\alpha$ emission). The early excess light in
the multi-band light curve supports a non-degenerate companion in the
progenitor system of SN 2021hpr. At the same time, the non-detection of
emission lines opens a door for other methods to explain this event.

rate of $81^{+7}_{-2}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and dust attenuation $A_V\approx
1.6$, in line with other DSFGs on the star-forming main sequence. We develop a

redder than the outskirts. We interpret this to be the result of both a

generation techniques have shown great promise in recent years. However, the
generated code is difficult to meet the syntactic constraints of the target
language, especially in the case of Turducken-style code, where declarative
code snippets are embedded within imperative programs. In this study, we
summarize the lack of syntactic constraints into three significant challenges:
(1) the efficient representation of syntactic constraints, (2) the effective
integration of syntactic information, and (3) the scalable syntax-first
decoding algorithm. To address these challenges, we propose a syntax-guided
multi-task learning approach TurduckenGen. Specifically, we first explicitly
append the type information to the code tokens to capture the representation of
syntactic constraints. Then we formalize code generation with syntactic
constraint representation as an auxiliary task to enable the model to learn the
syntactic constraints of the code. Finally, the syntactically correct code is
selected accurately from the multiple candidates with the help of the compiler
feedback. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the
effectiveness and general applicability of our approach after being compared
with six state-of-the-art baselines on two Turducken-style code datasets.
Finally, we conducted a human study and found the code quality generated by our
approach is better than baselines in terms of code readability and semantic

devices are not aware of the hiring process and are made aware by utilizing
their social connections. Each of the IoT devices reports a cost (private

the valuation of the IoT devices satisfies gross substitute criteria and is

deciding their payment respectively. Theoretical analysis shows that the
proposed mechanisms are computationally efficient, truthful, correct, budget
feasible, and individually rational. The simulation is done to measure the
efficacy of the proposed mechanisms with the benchmark mechanisms based on
truthfulness, budget feasibility, and running time.

Positive-pair-Only Contrastive Learning (POCL) has achieved reliable
performance without the need to construct positive-negative training sets. It
reduces memory requirements by lessening the dependency on the batch size. The
POCL method typically uses a single loss function to extract the distortion
invariant representation (DIR) which describes the proximity of positive-pair
representations affected by different distortions. This loss function
implicitly enables the model to filter out or ignore the distortion variant
representation (DVR) affected by different distortions. However, existing POCL
methods do not explicitly enforce the disentanglement and exploitation of the
actually valuable DVR. In addition, these POCL methods have been observed to be
sensitive to augmentation strategies. To address these limitations, we propose
a novel POCL framework named Distortion-Disentangled Contrastive Learning

explicitly disentangle and exploit the DVR inside the model and feature stream
to improve the overall representation utilization efficiency, robustness and

RGQA, which combines AQs from an existing VQA dataset with around 29K
human-annotated UQs. These UQs consist of both fine-grained and coarse-grained
image-question pairs generated with 2 approaches: CLIP-based and
Perturbation-based. To address the second drawback, we introduce an
unsupervised training approach. This combines pseudo UQs obtained by randomly
pairing images and questions, with an RoI Mixup procedure to generate more
fine-grained pseudo UQs, and model ensembling to regularize model confidence.
Experiments show that using pseudo UQs significantly outperforms RVQA
baselines. RoI Mixup and model ensembling further increase the gain. Finally,
human evaluation reveals a performance gap between humans and models, showing
that more RVQA research is needed.

transferring and adapting the policy to unseen but similar environments is
still a significant challenge. Recently, the language-conditioned policy is
proposed to facilitate policy transfer through learning the joint
representation of observation and text that catches the compact and invariant
information across environments. Existing studies of language-conditioned RL
methods often learn the joint representation as a simple latent layer for the
given instances (episode-specific observation and text), which inevitably
includes noisy or irrelevant information and cause spurious correlations that
are dependent on instances, thus hurting generalization performance and
training efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a conceptual
reinforcement learning (CRL) framework to learn the concept-like joint
representation for language-conditioned policy. The key insight is that
concepts are compact and invariant representations in human cognition through
extracting similarities from numerous instances in real-world. In CRL, we
propose a multi-level attention encoder and two mutual information constraints
for learning compact and invariant concepts. Verified in two challenging
environments, RTFM and Messenger, CRL significantly improves the training
efficiency (up to 70%) and generalization ability (up to 30%) to the new

past information and formulates localization in a coarse-to-fine scheme using
Box Priors given in the first frame. Specifically, past frames with targetness
masks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates
tracked target cues from the memory to the current frame. To precisely localize
objects of all sizes, MBPTrack first predicts the target center via Hough
voting. By leveraging box priors given in the first frame, we adaptively sample
reference points around the target center that roughly cover the target of
different sizes. Then, we obtain dense feature maps by aggregating point
features into the reference points, where localization can be performed more
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves

Instead of locating multiple regions, we propose a Progressive
Self-Distillation (PSD) method, which progressively enhances the ability of
network to mine more details for food recognition. The training of PSD
simultaneously contains multiple self-distillations, in which a teacher network
and a student network share the same embedding network. Since the student
network receives a modified image from its teacher network by masking some
informative regions, the teacher network outputs stronger semantic

stronger semantics, the student network is encouraged to mine more useful
regions from the modified image by enhancing its own ability. The ability of
the teacher network is also enhanced with the shared embedding network. By
using progressive training, the teacher network incrementally improves its
ability to mine more discriminative regions. In inference phase, only the
teacher network is used without the help of the student network. Extensive

intuitions around the nature and extent of perturbations. Particularly, it is
unclear to what extent can inputs be perturbed while preserving legibility, or
how to quantify the legibility of a perturbed string. In this work, we address
this gap by learning models that predict the legibility of a perturbed string,
and rank candidate perturbations based on their legibility. To do so, we
collect and release LEGIT, a human-annotated dataset comprising the legibility

can evolve to hydrogen- and helium-deficient giants with maximum radius of
about 300Rsun. Our models show evidence that merger remnants more massive than
1.95Msun can ignite Ne before significant mass-loss ensues, and they thus would
become electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). However, remnants with initial
masses less than 1.90Msun will experience further core contraction and longer
evolutionary time before reaching at the conditions for Ne-burning. Therefore
their fates are more dependent on mass-loss rates due to stellar winds, and
thus more uncertain. Relatively high mass-loss rates would cause such remnants
to end their lives as ONe WDs. Our evolutionary models can naturally explain
the observational properties of the double WD merger remnant IRAS 00500+6713

time. It relies on the invariant operators of the local and nominal dissipative
dynamics of the subsystems. It is shown that second-order expansion can be
computed with only local calculations avoiding global computations on the
entire Hilbert space. This algorithm is particularly well suited for simulation
of autonomous quantum error correction schemes, such as in bosonic codes with
Schr\""odinger cat states. These second-order Heisenberg simulations have been
compared with complete Schr\""odinger simulations and analytical formulas
obtained by second order adiabatic elimination. These comparisons have been
performed three cat-qubit gates: a Z-gate on a single cat qubit; a ZZ-gate on
two cat qubits; a ZZZ-gate on three cat qubits. For the ZZZ-gate, complete
Schr\""odinger simulations are almost impossible when $\alpha^2$, the energy of
each cat qubit, exceeds 8, whereas second-order Heisenberg simulations remain
easily accessible up to machine precision. These numerical investigations
indicate that second-order Heisenberg dynamics capture the very small bit-flip
error probabilities and their exponential decreases versus $\alpha^2$ varying
from 1 to 16. They also provides a direct numerical access to quantum process
tomography, the so called $\chi$ matrix providing a complete characterization
of the different error channels with their probabilities.

task distribution and further designing algorithms with stronger

Distribution Relevance (TDR) via optimal Q functions to capture the relevance

i.e., the tasks differ significantly, we demonstrate that the Markovian
policies cannot distinguish them, yielding poor performance accordingly. Based
on this observation, we propose a framework of Reward Informed Dreamer (RID)
with reward-informed world models, which captures invariant latent features
over tasks and encodes reward signals into policies for distinguishing
different tasks. In RID, we calculate the corresponding variational lower bound
of the log-likelihood on the data, which includes a novel term to distinguish
different tasks via states, based on reward-informed world models. Finally,
extensive experiments in DeepMind control suite demonstrate that RID can

emergence of videos on the Internet. The dominant paradigm for video retrieval
learns video-text representations by pushing the distance between the
similarity of positive pairs and that of negative pairs apart from a fixed
margin. However, negative pairs used for training are sampled randomly, which
indicates that the semantics between negative pairs may be related or even
equivalent, while most methods still enforce dissimilar representations to
decrease their similarity. This phenomenon leads to inaccurate supervision and
poor performance in learning video-text representations.
  While most video retrieval methods overlook that phenomenon, we propose an
adaptive margin changed with the distance between positive and negative pairs
to solve the aforementioned issue. First, we design the calculation framework
of the adaptive margin, including the method of distance measurement and the
function between the distance and the margin. Then, we explore a novel
implementation called ""Cross-Modal Generalized Self-Distillation"" (CMGSD),
which can be built on the top of most video retrieval models with few
modifications. Notably, CMGSD adds few computational overheads at train time
and adds no computational overhead at test time. Experimental results on three
widely used datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can yield
significantly better performance than the corresponding backbone model, and it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

for quantum communication, quantum sensing, quantum simulation and quantum
computing. However, conventional quantum state tomography and recently proposed
classical shadow tomography require truncation of the Hilbert space or phase
space and the resulting sample complexity scales exponentially with the number
of modes. In this paper, we propose a quantum-enhanced learning strategy for
continuous-variable states overcoming the previous shortcomings. We use this to
estimate the point values of a state characteristic function, which is useful
for quantum state tomography and inferring physical properties like quantum
fidelity, nonclassicality and quantum non-Gaussianity. We show that for any
continuous-variable quantum states $\rho$ with reflection symmetry - for
example Gaussian states with zero mean values, Fock states,
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, Schr\""odinger cat states and binomial code
states - on practical quantum devices we only need a constant number of copies
of state $\rho$ to accurately estimate the square of its characteristic
function at arbitrary phase-space points. This is achieved by performinig a
balanced beam splitter on two copies of $\rho$ followed by homodyne
measurements. Based on this result, we show that, given nonlocal quantum
measurements, for any $k$-mode continuous-variable states $\rho$ having
reflection symmetry, we only require $O(\log M)$ copies of $\rho$ to accurately
estimate its characteristic function values at any $M$ phase-space points.
Furthermore, the number of copies is independent of $k$. This can be compared
with restricted conventional approach, where $\Omega(M)$ copies are required to
estimate the characteristic function values at $M$ arbitrary phase-space
points.

with accurate expected non-linearity artificially is still a problem, which
greatly limits their experimental study and engineering application. In this
paper, we present a general nonlinear mechanical model (GNMM) based on
special-shaped cam-spring mechanism (SCSM). GNMM consists of a mass, a roller,
a track and a novel general spring model (GSM). Firstly, the equation of motion
is derived and compared with that of SCSM. Then, the roller trajectory
functions for arbitrary given continuous force are derived. Finally, Duffing
system with softening non-linearity is constructed as a design example. The
results presented herein show that GNMM has a more general restoring force than
SCSM, and prove that there are at least six independent mechanical
configurations for a given nonlinear system with continuous restoring force.

methods mainly investigate the reconstruction difference between normal and
abnormal patterns but ignore the semantics consistency between appearance and
motion information of behavior patterns, making the results highly dependent on
the local context of frame sequences and lacking the understanding of behavior
semantics. To address this issue, we propose a framework of Appearance-Motion
Semantics Representation Consistency that uses the gap of appearance and motion
semantic representation consistency between normal and abnormal data. The
two-stream structure is designed to encode the appearance and motion
information representation of normal samples, and a novel consistency loss is
proposed to enhance the consistency of feature semantics so that anomalies with
low consistency can be identified. Moreover, the lower consistency features of
anomalies can be used to deteriorate the quality of the predicted frame, which
makes anomalies easier to spot. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

anomaly detection is commonly viewed as a one-class classification problem.
Many prevalent methods investigate the reconstruction difference produced by
AutoEncoders (AEs) under the assumption that the AEs would reconstruct the
normal data well while reconstructing anomalies poorly. However, even with only
normal data training, the AEs often reconstruct anomalies well, which depletes
their anomaly detection performance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a
simple yet efficient framework for video anomaly detection. The pseudo anomaly
samples are introduced, which are synthesized from only normal data by
embedding random mask tokens without extra data processing. We also propose a
normalcy consistency training strategy that encourages the AEs to better learn
the regular knowledge from normal and corresponding pseudo anomaly data. This
way, the AEs learn more distinct reconstruction boundaries between normal and

an important role thanks to its diverse physical properties, which have been

being chemically stable, easy to fabricate with high quality and to grow

We assess the impact of spatial and temporal smoothing on reliability of

and focus on wind power. We represent regional electricity production and
demand through two stochastic processes: the wind capacity factors are modelled
as a two-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and electricity demand consists
of realistic base load and temperature-induced load coming from a
deseasonalised autoregressive process. We validate these processes, that we
have trained on historical data, through Monte Carlo simulations allowing us to
generate many statistically representative weather years. For the investigated
realisations (weather years) we study deviations of production from demand
under different wind capacities, and introduce different scenarios where
flexibility options like storage and transmission is available. Our analysis
shows that simulated loss values are reduced significantly by cooperation and
any mode of flexibility. Combining storage and transmission leads to even more
synergies and helps to stabilise production levels and thus adequacy of

WordNet to extend the range of words forming the prompt texts from only
closed-set label words to more. Thus, prompts are tuned in a simulated open-set

large datasets causes a much higher false positive rate than on small datasets,
we propose the Combinatorial Tuning and Testing (CTT) strategy for improving

multi-task learning to achieve highly effective semi-supervised segmentation.
HD-Teacher employs a 2D and a 3D mean-teacher network to produce segmentation
labels and signed distance fields from the hybrid information captured in both
dimensionalities. This hybrid learning mechanism allows HD-Teacher to combine
the `best of both worlds', utilizing features extracted from either 2D, 3D, or

teacher models are also dynamically combined, based on their individual
uncertainty scores, into a single hybrid prediction, where the hybrid
uncertainty is estimated. We then propose a hybrid regularization module to
encourage both student models to produce results close to the
uncertainty-weighted hybrid prediction. The hybrid uncertainty suppresses
unreliable knowledge in the hybrid prediction, leaving only useful information
to improve network performance further. Extensive experiments of binary and

\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ in the past. It is shown that the near-threshold
enhancement observed for the two $e^+e^-$ reactions can be reproduced by
considering the $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ final-state interaction in the partial
waves suggested by the helicity-angle analysis of the experiments. For $e^+e^-
\to \eta\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ the same $\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ $S$-wave interaction
as in $e^+e^- \to \Lambda\bar\Lambda$ is relevant and with it a consistent
description of the pertinent measurements can be achieved. It is pointed out
that a nonzero threshold cross section as observed for the latter reaction is
not supported by the new $\eta\Lambda\bar\Lambda$ data.

distribution. If the number of vertices is large, the binomial can be
approximated by Normal using the Central Limit Theorem, which is often allowed
when $\min (np, n(1-p)) > 5$. This is true for every node independently.
However, due to the fact that the degrees of nodes in a graph are not
independent, we aim in this paper to test whether the degrees of per node
collectively in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph have a multivariate normal
distribution MVN. A chi square goodness of fit test for the hypothesis that
binomial is a distribution for the whole set of nodes is rejected because of
the dependence between degrees. Before testing MVN we show that the covariance
and correlation between the degrees of any pair of nodes in the graph are
$p(1-p)$ and $1/(n-1)$, respectively. We test MVN considering two assumptions:
independent and dependent degrees, and we obtain our results based on the
percentages of rejected statistics of chi square, the $p$-values of Anderson
Darling test, and a CDF comparison. We always achieve a good fit of
multivariate normal distribution with large values of $n$ and $p$, and very
poor fit when $n$ or $p$ are very small. The approximation seems valid when $np
\geq 10$. We also compare the maximum likelihood estimate of $p$ in MVN

comprising millions of sources, have become available where one could
investigate dipole asymmetries, assumedly arising due to a peculiar motion of
the Solar system. Investigations of such dipoles have yielded in past much
larger amplitudes than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, though
their directions seem to lie close to the CMB dipole. Here we investigate
dipole asymmetries in two recent large radio surveys, Very Large Array Sky
Survey (VLASS) containing 1.9 million sources, covering the sky north of
$-40^\circ$ declination, and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) containing
2.1 million sources, covering the sky south of $+30^\circ$ declination. We find
dipoles determined from the VLASS and RACS surveys to be significantly larger
than the CMB dipole. Dipole directions from the VLASS and RACS data differ
significantly from each other. Nevertheless, along with a number of other
previously determined dipoles, including the CMB, they all appear to lie in a
narrow sky region, which argues for the various dipoles to be related somehow.
However, significant differences in their derived peculiar velocities,
including that of the CMB, cannot be explained by a peculiar motion of the
Solar system, which should necessarily be a single value. Instead, their
discordant peculiar velocities may be indicating that different cosmic
reference frames are moving relative to each other or that the matter
distribution on cosmic scales is not homogeneous and isotropic, either scenario
being in contravention of what expected from the Cosmological Principle (CP).

multi-lepton signatures arising from gluinos via intermediate eweakinos and
sleptons at an early stage of the LHC RUN-III. The heavier eweakinos can give
rise to three or four lepton signals in which the squark hierarchy between L

right squarks are heavy, exhibit the best prospect of discovering gluinos in
the multi-lepton channels in the LHC RUN-III experiment. This paper's findings

properties of their stellar populations with Firefly. We also investigated the
origin of the emission lines in a nearby FG, NGC 4104, that has an AGN. A
single Sersic profile can fit most objects in the u band, while two Sersics are
needed in the r and rLSB bands, both for FGs and non-FGs. Non-FG BGGs cover a
larger range of Sersic index. FG BGGs follow the Kormendy relation derived for
almost one thousand brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) by Chu et al. (2022)
while non-FGs BGGs are mostly located below this relation, suggesting that FG
BGGs have evolved similarly to BCGs, while non-FG BGGs have evolved
differently. The above properties can be strongly modified by the subtraction
of intracluster light contribution. The stellar populations of FG and non-FG

1892 at Paris observatory. He invented, concurrently with George Hale in
Kenwood (USA) but quite independently, the spectroheliograph designed for
monochromatic imagery of the Sun. Deslandres developed two kinds of
spectrographs: the ''spectroh{\'e}liographe des formes'', i.e. the narrow
bandpass instrument to reveal chromospheric structures (such as filaments,
prominences, plages and active regions); and the ''spectroh{\'e}liographe des
vitesses'', i.e. the ''section'' spectroheliograph to record line profiles of
cross sections of the Sun, in order to measure the Dopplershifts of dynamic
features. Deslandres moved to Meudon in 1898 with his instruments and improved
the spectral and spatial resolutions, leading to the large quadruple
spectroheliograph in 1908 developed with Lucien d'Azambuja. CaII K systematic
observations started at this date and were followed in 1909 by H$\alpha$ with
two dedicated 3-metres spectroheliographs. The observing service was organized
by d'Azambuja who also intensively used the large 7-metres spectroheliograph
for his research and thesis (1930). This paper summarizes fifty years of
research by Mr and Mrs d'Azambuja, who explored various photospheric and
chromospheric lines, performing special spectroheliograms with the high
dispersion 7-metres instrument. They also observed intensively filaments and
prominences (memoir published in 1948) and recorded rare solar activity events
with the two 3-metres spectroheliographs, during the first half of the
twentieth century.

However, the aforementioned phase shifter technology is based on a single gold

complexity due to intrinsic geometrical constraints. To increase the
compactness, we propose two improvements to this technology. Firstly, we
fabricated thermal phase shifters with a photolithography process based on two
different metal films, namely chromium for microheaters and copper for contact
pads and interconnections. Secondly, we developed a novel curved isolation
trench design that, along with a state-of-the-art curvature radius, allows for
a significant reduction in the optical length of integrated circuits. As a
result, curved Cr-Cu phase shifters provide a compact footprint with low
parasitic series resistance and no significant increase in power dissipation (~
38 mW) and thermal crosstalk (~ 20%). These results pave the way toward the
fabrication of femtosecond-laser-written photonic circuits with a steep
increase in terms of layout complexity.

(GP) as a tool to reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ with two upcoming
gravitational wave missions, namely the evolved Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (eLISA) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). We perform non-parametric
reconstructions of $H(z)$ with GP using realistically generated catalogues,
assuming various background cosmological models, for each mission. We also take
into account the effect of early-time and late-time priors separately on the
reconstruction, and hence on the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Our analysis reveals
that GPs are quite robust in reconstructing the expansion history of the
Universe within the observational window of the specific mission under study.
We further confirm that both eLISA and ET would be able to constrain $H(z)$ and
$H_0$ to a much higher precision than possible today, and also find out their
possible role in addressing the Hubble tension for each model, on a
case-by-case basis.

a set of relations between the objective focus and diameter, the eyepiece
focus, and the magnification that resulted from combining the two lenses. These
relations were used by him and his brother to build what he believed were
optimized telescopes. When comparing these equations to the ones derived from
modern optical principles, Huygens' telescopes were in fact far from optimal.
While there are several potential reasons for this discrepancy, one possible
reason, explored in this work, is that Huygens might have suffered from a mild
case of myopia (or near-sightedness) and that he compensated for this condition
by building telescopes that overmagnified by a factor of 3.5. Based on this
hypothesis, Huygens' visual acuity is estimated to be around 20/70, which on
average corresponds to an optical prescription of -1.5 diopters

De-identification with Latent Encryptor, to protect the identity information of
people from being misused. Built upon a pre-learned StyleGAN2 generator, RiDDLE
manages to encrypt and decrypt the facial identity within the latent space. The
design of RiDDLE has three appealing properties. First, the encryption process
is cipher-guided and hence allows diverse anonymization using different
passwords. Second, the true identity can only be decrypted with the correct
password, otherwise the system will produce another de-identified face to
maintain the privacy. Third, both encryption and decryption share an efficient
implementation, benefiting from a carefully tailored lightweight encryptor.
Comparisons with existing alternatives confirm that our approach accomplishes
the de-identification task with better quality, higher diversity, and stronger
reversibility. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of RiDDLE in
anonymizing videos. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is to reconstruct and
extrapolate atmospheric muon tracks down to the central detector. This muon
tracker will help to evaluate the contribution of the cosmogenic background to
the signal. The Top Tracker is located above JUNO's water Cherenkov Detector
and Central Detector, covering about 60% of the surface above them. The JUNO
Top Tracker is constituted by the decommissioned OPERA experiment Target
Tracker modules. The technology used consists in walls of two planes of plastic
scintillator strips, one per transverse direction. Wavelength shifting fibres
collect the light signal emitted by the scintillator strips and guide it to
both ends where it is read by multianode photomultiplier tubes. Compared to the
OPERA Target Tracker, the JUNO Top Tracker uses new electronics able to cope
with the high rate produced by the high rock radioactivity compared to the one
in Gran Sasso underground laboratory. This paper will present the new
electronics and mechanical structure developed for the Top Tracker of JUNO
along with its expected performance based on the current detector simulation.

every modality (virtual slides, MRI, etc.) In histopathology, these methods can
be used to detect certain biomarkers or classify lesions. However, such
techniques require large amounts of data to train high-performing models which
can be intrinsically difficult to acquire, especially when it comes to scarce
biomarkers. To address this challenge, we use a single, pre-trained, deep
embeddings extractor to convert images into deep features and train small,
dedicated classification head on these embeddings for each classification task.
This approach offers several benefits such as the ability to reuse a single
pre-trained deep network for various tasks; reducing the amount of labeled data
needed as classification heads have fewer parameters; and accelerating training
time by up to 1000 times, which allows for much more tuning of the
classification head. In this work, we perform an extensive comparison of
various open-source backbones and assess their fit to the target histological
image domain. This is achieved using a novel method based on a proxy
classification task. We demonstrate that thanks to this selection method, an
optimal feature extractor can be selected for different tasks on the target
domain. We also introduce a feature space augmentation strategy which proves to
substantially improve the final metrics computed for the different tasks
considered. To demonstrate the benefit of such backbone selection and
feature-space augmentation, our experiments are carried out on three separate
classification tasks and show a clear improvement on each of them:
microcalcifications (29.1% F1-score increase), lymph nodes metastasis (12.5%

sixth generation communications (6G), has attracted research interest from both
academia and industry. However, semantic communication is still in its infancy
and it faces many challenges, such as semantic information definition and
semantic communication measurement. To address these challenges, we investigate
unified semantic information measures and semantic channel coding theorem.
Specifically, to address the shortcoming of existing semantic entropy
definitions can only be applied to specific tasks, we propose a universal
semantic entropy definition as the uncertainty in the semantic interpretation
of random variable symbols in the context of knowledge bases. The proposed
universal semantic entropy not only depends on the probability distribution,
but also depends on the specific value of the symbol and the background
knowledge base. Under the given conditions, the proposed universal semantic
entropy definition can degenerate into the existing semantic entropy and
Shannon entropy definitions. Moreover, since the accurate transmission of
semantic symbols in the semantic communication system can allow a non-zero bit
error rate, we conjecture that the bit rate of the semantic communication may
exceed the Shannon channel capacity. Furthermore, we propose a semantic channel
coding theorem, and prove its achievability and converse. Since the well-known
Fano's inequality cannot be directly applied to semantic communications, we
derive and prove the semantic Fano's inequality, and use it to prove the
converse. To our best knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof that the
transmission rate of semantic communication can exceed the Shannon channel
capacity, which provides a theoretical basis for semantic communication
research.

certain non-Hermitian systems with gain and/or loss. Most of previous works
study the non-Hermitian skin effect in periodic systems. However,
electromagnetic waves often propagate within uniform materials without periodic
modulation, and it has not been clear whether the optical NHSE occurs in
uniform media such as bulk materials and electromagnetic metamaterials. Here we
establish the theory of the optical NHSE in non-Hermitian anisotropic media. We
show that the NHSE occurs even in uniform media with appropriate anisotropy and
material loss. The localization of non-Hermitian skin modes are completely
determined by an effective gauge potential caused by the anisotropy of a
dielectric tensor. On the basis of the theory, we propose subwavelength
multilayer metamaterials as a novel platform for the optical NHSE. We also
propose a new concept of stationarily-excited skin modes whose frequencies are
forced to be real in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the NHSE occurs even
under the condition that the frequency is forced to be real, which implies that
the NHSE we propose is observable under stationary excitation. Our work
presents a general theory of the NHSE in homogeneous systems, and pave the way
to realize the optical NHSE in bulk materials and metamaterials.

(hyperparameters) that affect the system's performance. However, defining a
good choice of hyperparameters is a challenging problem.
  Hyperparameter tuning often requires manual or automated searches to find
optimal values. Nonetheless, a noticeable limitation is the high cost of
algorithm evaluation for complex models, making the tuning process
computationally expensive and time-consuming.
  In this paper, we propose a framework based on integrating complex event
processing and temporal models, to alleviate these trade-offs. Through this
combination, it is possible to gain insights about a running RL system
efficiently and unobtrusively based on data stream monitoring and to create
abstract representations that allow reasoning about the historical behaviour of
the RL system. The obtained knowledge is exploited to provide feedback to the
RL system for optimising its hyperparameters while making effective use of
parallel resources.
  We introduce a novel history-aware epsilon-greedy logic for hyperparameter
optimisation that instead of using static hyperparameters that are kept fixed
for the whole training, adjusts the hyperparameters at runtime based on the
analysis of the agent's performance over time windows in a single agent's
lifetime. We tested the proposed approach in a 5G mobile communications case
study that uses DQN, a variant of RL, for its decision-making. Our experiments
demonstrated the effects of hyperparameter tuning using history on training
stability and reward values. The encouraging results show that the proposed
history-aware framework significantly improved performance compared to
traditional hyperparameter tuning approaches.

CMA -- leverages such image pairs to learn condition-invariant features via
contrastive learning. In particular, CMA encourages features in the embedding
space to be grouped according to their condition-invariant semantic content and
not according to the condition under which respective inputs are captured. To

traditional power scheduling. It is difficult for operators to obtain accurate
day-ahead forecasts of renewable generation, thereby requiring the future
scheduling system to make real-time scheduling decisions aligning with
ultra-short-term forecasts. Restricted by the computation speed, traditional
optimization-based methods can not solve this problem. Recent developments in
reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the potential to solve this
challenge. However, the existing RL methods are inadequate in terms of
constraint complexity, algorithm performance, and environment fidelity. We are
the first to propose a systematic solution based on the state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithm and the real power grid environment. The
proposed approach enables planning and finer time resolution adjustments of
power generators, including unit commitment and economic dispatch, thus
increasing the grid's ability to admit more renewable energy. The well-trained
scheduling agent significantly reduces renewable curtailment and load shedding,
which are issues arising from traditional scheduling's reliance on inaccurate
day-ahead forecasts. High-frequency control decisions exploit the existing
units' flexibility, reducing the power grid's dependence on hardware
transformations and saving investment and operating costs, as demonstrated in
experimental results. This research exhibits the potential of reinforcement
learning in promoting low-carbon and intelligent power systems and represents a
solid step toward sustainable electricity generation.

Byzantine robustness, communication efficiency and privacy preservation are
three important aspects. However, the tension among these three aspects makes
it hard to simultaneously take all of them into account. In view of this
challenge, we theoretically analyze the conditions that a communication
compression method should satisfy to be compatible with existing
Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Motivated by the
analysis results, we propose a novel communication compression method called
consensus sparsification (ConSpar). To the best of our knowledge, ConSpar is
the first communication compression method that is designed to be compatible
with both Byzantine-robust methods and privacy-preserving methods. Based on
ConSpar, we further propose a novel FL framework called FedREP, which is
Byzantine-robust, communication-efficient and privacy-preserving. We
theoretically prove the Byzantine robustness and the convergence of FedREP.
Empirical results show that FedREP can significantly outperform
communication-efficient privacy-preserving baselines. Furthermore, compared
with Byzantine-robust communication-efficient baselines, FedREP can achieve
comparable accuracy with the extra advantage of privacy preservation.

of $O(n+k)$ and improves error scaling performance compared to existing

tasks when the number of data items exceeds $2^n$, which outperforms the

development of time and error-optimized data access protocols for QRAM devices,
reducing the qubit count and error requirements for QRAM implementation, and

infinite (x,y)-plane. A mean magnetic field of strength B0 is introduced and
the MHD linear stability problem studied for modes with wave-number k in the
y-direction, and Bloch wavenumber l in the x-direction. The parameters
governing the problem are Reynolds number 1/nu, magnetic Prandtl number P, and
dimensionless magnetic field strength B0. The mean magnetic field can be taken
to have an arbitrary direction in the (x,y)-plane and a mean x-directed flow U0
can be incorporated.
  First the paper considers Kolmogorov flow with y-directed mean magnetic
field, referred to as vertical. Taking l=0, the suppression of the pure
hydrodynamic instability is observed with increasing field strength B0. A
branch of strong-field instabilities occurs for magnetic Prandtl number P less
than unity, as found by A.E. Fraser, I.G. Cresser and P. Garaud (J. Fluid Mech.
949, A43, 2022). Analytical results using eigenvalue perturbation theory in the
limit k->0 support the numerics for both weak- and strong-field instabilities,
and originate in the coupling of large-scale modes with x-wavenumber n=0, to
smaller-scale modes.
  The paper considers the case of horizontal or x-directed mean magnetic field.
The unperturbed state consists of steady, wavey magnetic field lines. As the
magnetic field is increased, the purely hydrodynamic instability is suppressed
again, but for stronger fields a new branch of instabilities appears. Allowing
a non-zero Bloch wavenumber l allows further instability, and in some
circumstances when the system is hydrodynamically stable, arbitrarily weak
magnetic fields can give growing modes. Numerical results are presented
together with eigenvalue perturbation theory in the limits k,l->0. The theory
gives analytical approximations for growth rates and thresholds in good
agreement with those computed.

more subtle situations in which the satisfaction of some goals inhibits the
satisfaction of others. These latter issues, called goal divergences, are the
subject of goal conflict analysis, which consists of identifying, assessing,
and resolving divergences, as part of a more general activity known as goal
refinement. While there exist techniques that, when requirements are expressed
formally, can automatically identify and assess goal conflicts, there is
currently no automated approach to support engineers in resolving identified
divergences. In this paper, we present ACoRe, the first approach that
automatically proposes potential resolutions to goal conflicts, in requirements
specifications formally captured using linear-time temporal logic. ACoRe
systematically explores syntactic modifications of the conflicting
specifications, aiming at obtaining resolutions that disable previously
identified conflicts, while preserving specification consistency. ACoRe
integrates modern multi-objective search algorithms (in particular, NSGA-III,
WBGA, and AMOSA) to produce resolutions that maintain coherence with the
original conflicting specification, by searching for specifications that are
either syntactically or semantically similar to the original specification. We
assess ACoRe on 25 requirements specifications taken from the literature. We
show that ACoRe can successfully produce various conflict resolutions for each

beneficial for defining regions of interest (ROI) for streamline of diagnostic
and prognostic tasks. Still, adapting to different domains is essential for
histopathology image analysis, as the visual characteristics of tissues can
vary significantly across datasets. Yet, acquiring sufficient annotated data in
the medical domain is cumbersome and time-consuming. The labeling effort can be
significantly reduced by leveraging active learning, which enables the
selective annotation of the most informative samples. Our proposed method
allows for fine-tuning a pre-trained deep neural network using a small set of
labeled data from the target domain, while also actively selecting the most
informative samples to label next. We demonstrate that our approach performs
with significantly fewer labeled samples compared to traditional supervised
learning approaches for similar F1-scores, using barely a 59\% of the training
set. We also investigate the distribution of class balance to establish
annotation guidelines.

Cellular Automata (CA) work by either iterating a finite CA for several time
steps, or by a one-shot application of the global rule. The main characteristic
that brings together these works is that they employ a single CA rule to define
the vectorial Boolean function of the S-box. In this work, we explore a
different direction for the design of S-boxes that leverages on Orthogonal CA
(OCA), i.e. pairs of CA rules giving rise to orthogonal Latin squares. The
motivation stands on the facts that an OCA pair already defines a bijective
transformation, and moreover the orthogonality property of the resulting Latin
squares ensures a minimum amount of diffusion. We exhaustively enumerate all
S-boxes generated by OCA pairs of diameter $4 \le d \le 6$, and measure their
nonlinearity. Interestingly, we observe that for $d=4$ and $d=5$ all S-boxes
are linear, despite the underlying CA local rules being nonlinear. The smallest
nonlinear S-boxes emerges for $d=6$, but their nonlinearity is still too low to
be used in practice. Nonetheless, we unearth an interesting structure of linear
OCA S-boxes, proving that their Linear Components Space (LCS) is itself the
image of a linear CA, or equivalently a polynomial code. We finally classify
all linear OCA S-boxes in terms of their generator polynomials.

the first few eigenfunctions of a judicious elliptic operator, which itself

existing skeleton-based methods, achieving comparable recognition results to

voltage parameter in the experimental set-up controls the onset of oscillations
via a Hopf bifurcation. For a smaller voltage, the oscillators exhibit simple,
so-called primary, clustering patterns, where all phase differences between
each set of coupled oscillators are identical. However, upon increasing the
voltage, additional secondary states, where phase differences differ, are
detected. Previous work on this system saw the development of a mathematical
model that explains how the existence, stability, and common frequency of the
experimentally observed cluster states can be accurately controlled by the
delay time of the coupling.
  In this study, we revisit the mathematical model of the electrochemical
oscillators to address open questions by means of bifurcation analysis. Our
analysis reveals how the stable cluster states, corresponding to experimental
observations, lose their stability via an assortment of bifurcation types. The
analysis further reveals a complex interconnectedness between branches of
different cluster types; in particular, we find that each secondary state
provides a continuous transition between certain primary states. These
connections are explained by studying the phase space and parameter symmetries
of the respective states. Furthermore, we show that it is only for a larger
value of the voltage parameter that the branches of secondary states develop
intervals of stability. Otherwise, for a smaller voltage, all the branches of
secondary states are completely unstable and therefore hidden to
experimentalists.

the natural image field. However, when applying GANs in the remote sensing (RS)
image generation task, an extraordinary phenomenon is observed: the GAN model
is more sensitive to the size of training data for RS image generation than for
natural image generation. In other words, the generation quality of RS images
will change significantly with the number of training categories or samples per
category. In this paper, we first analyze this phenomenon from two kinds of toy
experiments and conclude that the amount of feature information contained in
the GAN model decreases with reduced training data. Then we establish a
structural causal model (SCM) of the data generation process and interpret the
generated data as the counterfactuals. Based on this SCM, we theoretically
prove that the quality of generated images is positively correlated with the
amount of feature information. This provides insights for enriching the feature
information learned by the GAN model during training. Consequently, we propose
two innovative adjustment schemes, namely Uniformity Regularization (UR) and
Entropy Regularization (ER), to increase the information learned by the GAN
model at the distributional and sample levels, respectively. We theoretically
and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our methods.

our methods outperform the well-established models on RS image generation

analysis framework for NODEs combining three key ideas: (i) a novel class of
ODE solvers, based on variable but discrete time steps, (ii) an efficient graph
representation of solver trajectories, and (iii) a novel abstraction algorithm
operating on this graph representation. Together, these advances enable the
efficient analysis and certified training of high-dimensional NODEs, by
reducing the runtime from an intractable $O(\exp(d)+\exp(T))$ to ${O}(d+T^2
\log^2T)$ in the dimensionality $d$ and integration time $T$. In an extensive
evaluation on computer vision (MNIST and FMNIST) and time-series forecasting
(PHYSIO-NET) problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both our certified
training and verification methods.

nonlinearity and investigate the formation mechanism of nonlinear localized
time-periodic solutions (breathers) with frequencies exited the spectral bands.
First we employ the long-chain limit to obtain estimates of linear eigenstates,
especially those with frequencies near the band edges. As the strength of
nonlinearity grows, some frequencies can cross the band edges to turn isolated
while the corresponding states gradually change from non-localized to
localized. Based on the estimates of linear eigenstates, we derive analytical
approximations of these nonlinear states and prove their validity for
frequencies within the bands. Moreover, the process of states growing localized
are illustrated in both analytical and numerical approaches. Although here we
place emphasis on nonlinear middle-localized states with the most generic
boundary conditions, the results can also be extended to a wider range of
localized states including edge states.

non-Gaussianity can lead to large-scale fluctuations in the PBH formation rate.
If PBHs make up a non-negligible fraction of dark matter, these fluctuations
can appear as isocurvature modes, and be used to constrain the amplitude of
non-Gaussianity. Assuming that the parameters of non-Gaussianity are constant
over all scales, we build upon the results of previous work by extending the
calculation to include peaks theory and making use of the compaction $C$ for
the formation criteria, accounting for non-linearities between $C$ and the
curvature perturbation $\zeta$. For quadratic models of non-Gaussianity, our
updated calculation gives constraints that are largely unaltered compared to
those previously found, while for cubic models the constraints worsen
significantly. In case all of the DM is made up of PBHs, the parameters of
non-Gaussianity are $-2.9\cdot10^{-4}<f<3.8\cdot10^{-4}$ and

the highly non-spherical morphology of W49B and the thermonuclear outburst to
its high iron abundance. CEJSNe are violent events powered by jets that a NS or
a BH launch as they orbit inside a red supergiant star and accrete mass from
its envelope and then from its core. We classify the CEJSN process to either a
case where the NS/BH enters the core to form a common envelope evolution (CEE)
inside the core or to a case where the NS/BH tidally disrupts the core. In the
later case the core material forms an accretion disk around the NS that might
experience a thermonuclear outburst, leading to an energetic event powered by
both jets and thermonuclear burning. We term this scenario thermonuclear CEJSN.
We find that the maximum core mass that leads to this scenario with a NS is $2
M_{\rm \odot} \lesssim M_{\rm core} \lesssim 3.5M_{\rm \odot}$. We estimate the
event rates of CEJSN that go through tidal disruption of the core by a NS to be
5 per 1000 core collapse supernovae.

To provide better constraints, we study the evolution of stellar masses in MHD
simulations of a (4 pc)^3 molecular cloud. Tracer particles allow us to
accurately follow the trajectory of accreting material for all protostars and
thereby constrain the accretion reservoir of the stars. The diversity of the
accretion process implies that stars in the solar mass regime can have vastly
different accretion histories. Some stars accrete most of their mass during the
initial collapse phase, while others gain >50 % of their final mass from late
infall. The angular momentum budget of stars that experience substantial
infall, so-called late accretors, is significantly higher than for stars
without or with only little late accretion. As the probability of late infall
increases with increasing final stellar mass, the specific angular momentum
budget of higher mass stars is on average higher. The hypothetical centrifugal
radius computed from the accreting particles at the time of formation is orders
of magnitude higher than observed disk sizes, which emphasizes the importance
of angular momentum transport during disk formation. Nevertheless, we find a
correlation that the centrifugal radius is highest for stars with substantial
infall, which suggests that very large disks are the result of recent infall
events. There are also indications for a subtle trend of increasing centrifugal
radius with increasing final stellar mass, which is in agreement with an
observed marginal correlation of disk size and stellar mass. Finally, we show
that late accretors become embedded again during infall. As a consequence, late
accretors are (apparently) rejuvenated and would be classified as Class 0
objects according to their bolometric temperature despite being 1 Myr old.

via active learning as needed. Our work builds on the Variational Bayesian

we introduce noise shaping, a general technique to induce the sparse GP
approximation to focus on high posterior density regions. Third, we prove
theoretical results in support of the SVBMC refinement procedure. We validate
our method on a variety of challenging synthetic scenarios and real-world

explored so far. In this work, the Chamon model is turned to a non-CSS error
correction code. Logical qubits are built by the construct of logical Pauli
operators. The property of logical operators reveals the expressions of code
distance. According to the topological properties of Chamon models, an error
elimination algorithm is proposed. Based on the error elimination algorithm, we
propose a global randomized error correction algorithm to decode Chamon models
in every single-qubit depolarized channel. This decoding algorithm is improved
by adding the pretreatment process, termed the probabilistic greedy local
algorithm, which adapts to different kinds of high-dimensional models. The
estimated threshold error rate for numerical experiment can be raised to
$4.92\%$.

learning methods have made it possible to improve the performance of cell
detection. However, a detection network trained with training data under a
specific condition (source domain) may not work well on data under other
conditions (target domains), which is called the domain shift problem. In
particular, cells are cultured under different conditions depending on the
purpose of the research. Characteristics, e.g., the shapes and density of the
cells, change depending on the conditions, and such changes may cause domain
shift problems. Here, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation method for
cell detection using a pseudo-cell-position heatmap, where the cell centroid is
at the peak of a Gaussian distribution in the map and selective
pseudo-labeling. In the prediction result for the target domain, even if the
peak location is correct, the signal distribution around the peak often has a
non-Gaussian shape. The pseudo-cell-position heatmap is thus re-generated using
the peak positions in the predicted heatmap to have a clear Gaussian shape. Our
method selects confident pseudo-cell-position heatmaps based on uncertainty and
curriculum learning. We conducted numerous experiments showing that, compared
with the existing methods, our method improved detection performance under
different conditions.

dominate the dielectric response at elevated temperatures and low frequencies,

observe dipolar relaxation dynamics of the dumbbell-shaped CN- ions, whose
temperature dependence follows Arrhenius behavior with a hindering barrier of
0.59 eV. It correlates well with a systematic development of the relaxation
dynamics with the cation radius, previously observed in various alkali
cyanides. By comparison with the latter, we conclude that AgCN does not exhibit
a plastic high-temperature phase with a free rotation of the cyanide ions.
Instead, our results indicate that a phase with quadrupolar order, revealing
dipolar head-to-tail disorder of the CN- ions, exists at elevated temperatures
up to the decomposition temperature, which crosses over to long-range polar
order of the CN dipole moments below about 475 K. Dipole ordering was also
reported for NaCN and KCN and a comparison with these systems suggests a
critical relaxation rate of 10^5 - 10^7 Hz marking the onset of dipolar order

Furthermore, our theory furnishes a single method of proof that independently
establishes and unifies several fundamental classification results on degree
three symplectic curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$. In particular, we prove using our
theory: (1) there is a unique isotopy class of degree three smooth symplectic

a complete invariant of the isotopy class of a degree three nodal symplectic
curve in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (the case of irreducible nodal curves is due to
Shevchishin and the case of reducible nodal curves is due to Golla-Starkston),
and (3) there is a unique isotopy class of degree three cuspidal symplectic
curves in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (a generalization of a result due to Ohta-Ono). The
present work represents the first step toward resolving the symplectic isotopy

model experiment using thin sheets suspended in a shear cell, we found that a
pair of sheets can bend for a shear rate ten times lower than the buckling
threshold defined for a single sheet. This effect is caused by a lateral
hydrodynamic force that arises from the disturbance flow field induced by the
neighboring sheet. The lateral hydrodynamic force removes the buckling
instability but massively enhances the bending deformation. For small
separations between sheets, lubrication forces prevail and prevent deformation.
Those two opposing effects result in a non-monotonic relation between distances

meaningful application to sedimentary geology still lacks content. Classical
shape descriptors (such as axis ratios, circularity of projection) were not
inherently three-dimensional, because no such technology existed. Recently a
new class of three-dimensional descriptors, collectively referred to as
mechanical descriptors has been introduced and applied for a broad range of
sedimentary particles. First order mechanical descriptors (registered for each
pebble as a pair $\{S,U\}$ of integers), refer to the respective numbers of
stable and unstable static equilibria and can be reliably detected by hand
experiments. However, they have limited ability of distinction as the majority
of coastal pebbles fall into primary class $\{S,U\}=\{2,2\}$. Higher order
mechanical descriptors offer a more refined distinction. However for the
extraction of these descriptors (registered as graphs for each pebble) hand
measurements are not an option and even computer-based extraction from 3D scans
offers a formidable challenge. Here we not only describe and implement an
algorithm to perform this task, but also apply it to a collection of 271
pebbles with various lithologies, illustrating that the application of higher
order descriptors is a viable option for geomorphologists. We also show that
the so-far uncharted connection between the two known secondary descriptors,
the so-called Morse-Smale graph and the Reeb-graph can be established via a
third order descriptor which we call the master graph.

separation, collision speed and collision distance. While all setups lead to
the formation of a sigmoid structure, only the cases with a close passing of
the spots cause flares and mass eruptions. The energy release is in the $1-2

different timings in the transition from a sheared magnetic arcade (SMA) to

superconductors has been a subject of debate, with various models proposing

the pairing symmetry of FeSe utilizing the new methodology of Tunneling Andreev
Reflection (TAR). TAR directly exploits the transparency-dependence of
tunneling current to disentangle contributions of single-particle current and
Andreev reflection. These measurements provided new direct evidence in favor of
the sign-changing nature of the superconducting order in FeSe, in a distinctly
complementary approach to nanoscale imaging of quasiparticle interference.
Crucially TAR can also probe higher-order contributions to Andreev reflection.
Quantitative comparison of the experimental signatures of higher-order Andreev
reflections with those in concomitant tight-binding simulations revealed new
evidence in support of the nodal gap structure of superconductivity in FeSe.
Finally, the effect of structural topological defects can be directly probed
with TAR owing to its atomic spatial resolution. In particular, we find that
superconductivity is completely suppressed along the twin boundary while its
electronic structure is characterized by a V-shaped signature of a pseudogap
state. Our findings provide new insight into the pairing symmetry of an
unconventional superconductor, demonstrating the potential of differential
tunneling Andreev reflection to reveal microscopic properties of emerging

information for sub-region analysis of brain tumors. Plenty of methods have
been proposed for automatic brain tumor segmentation using four common MRI
modalities and achieved remarkable performance. In practice, however, it is
common to have one or more modalities missing due to image corruption,
artifacts, acquisition protocols, allergy to contrast agents, or simply cost.
In this work, we propose a novel two-stage framework for brain tumor
segmentation with missing modalities. In the first stage, a multimodal masked
autoencoder (M3AE) is proposed, where both random modalities (i.e., modality
dropout) and random patches of the remaining modalities are masked for a
reconstruction task, for self-supervised learning of robust multimodal
representations against missing modalities. To this end, we name our framework
M3AE. Meanwhile, we employ model inversion to optimize a representative
full-modal image at marginal extra cost, which will be used to substitute for
the missing modalities and boost performance during inference. Then in the
second stage, a memory-efficient self distillation is proposed to distill
knowledge between heterogenous missing-modal situations while fine-tuning the
model for supervised segmentation. Our M3AE belongs to the 'catch-all' genre
where a single model can be applied to all possible subsets of modalities, thus
is economic for both training and deployment. Extensive experiments on BraTS
2018 and 2020 datasets demonstrate its superior performance to existing
state-of-the-art methods with missing modalities, as well as the efficacy of
its components. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ccarliu/m3ae.

vision and language pre-training (VLP). However, in real-world application
scenarios, aligned multi-modal data is usually in the image-caption format,
which only provides coarse-grained supervision. It is not only cost-expensive
but also compute-expensive to collect object annotations and build object
annotation pre-extractor for different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained VLP scheme without object annotations from the linguistic
perspective. First, we propose a homonym sentence rewriting (HSR) algorithm to
provide token-level supervision. The algorithm replaces a
verb/noun/adjective/quantifier word of the caption with its homonyms from
WordNet. Correspondingly, we propose refined vision-language modeling (RVLM)
framework to exploit the token-level supervision. Three refined tasks, i.e.,
refined image-text contrastive (RITC), refined image-text matching (RITM), and
replace language modeling (RLM) are proposed to learn the fine-grained
alignment. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method.

materials in steady state motion. By exploiting a boundary formulation based on
Green's function approach, the unknown contact domain is calculated by
enforcing a proper local energy balance that takes into account for the
contribution of the non-conservative work of internal stresses. The latter is
directly related to the odd part of the Green function. The theory predicts
that, within a certain a range of velocities, the interaction between adhesion
and viscoelasticity leads to enhanced adhesive performance, i.e. larger contact
area and pull-o? force, compared to the equivalent adhesive elastic case. At
low velocity friction is also strongly enhanced compared to the adhesiveless
viscoelastic case, mainly as a consequence of adhesion hysteresis induced by
the small-scale viscoelasticity. However, at intermediate and high velocity
values, the effect of viscoelastic hysteresis occurring at larger scales, i.e.
into the bulk, causes friction to increase further. Under these conditions, due
to the presence of adhesion, small-scale and bulk contribution to friction
cannot be linearly separated. As consequence of the finiteness of the contact
length, the energy release rates follow a non-monotonic trend, which is not
observed during crack propagation or healing in infinite systems. All the
presented results are strongly supported by existing experimental evidences.

all past results continue to hold for annotated databases, assuming that the
annotation itself is not part of the lexicographic order. On the other hand, we
show infeasibility for the case of count-distinct that does not have any

  Shift","16 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model calibration usually requires optimizing some parameters (e.g.,
temperature) w.r.t an objective function (e.g., negative log-likelihood). In
this paper, we report a plain, important but often neglected fact that the
objective function is influenced by calibration set difficulty, i.e., the ratio
of the number of incorrectly classified samples to that of correctly classified
samples. If a test set has a drastically different difficulty level from the
calibration set, the optimal calibration parameters of the two datasets would
be different. In other words, a calibrator optimal on the calibration set would
be suboptimal on the OOD test set and thus has degraded performance. With this
knowledge, we propose a simple and effective method named adaptive calibrator
ensemble (ACE) to calibrate OOD datasets whose difficulty is usually higher
than the calibration set. Specifically, two calibration functions are trained,
one for in-distribution data (low difficulty), and the other for severely OOD
data (high difficulty). To achieve desirable calibration on a new OOD dataset,
ACE uses an adaptive weighting method that strikes a balance between the two
extreme functions. When plugged in, ACE generally improves the performance of a
few state-of-the-art calibration schemes on a series of OOD benchmarks.
Importantly, such improvement does not come at the cost of the in-distribution
calibration accuracy.

reconstruction of perceived natural images based on fMRI signals. Previous
studies have succeeded in re-creating different aspects of the visuals, such as
low-level properties (shape, texture, layout) or high-level features (category
of objects, descriptive semantics of scenes) but have typically failed to
reconstruct these properties together for complex scene images. Generative AI
has recently made a leap forward with latent diffusion models capable of
generating high-complexity images. Here, we investigate how to take advantage
of this innovative technology for brain decoding. We present a two-stage scene
reconstruction framework called ``Brain-Diffuser''. In the first stage,
starting from fMRI signals, we reconstruct images that capture low-level
properties and overall layout using a VDVAE (Very Deep Variational Autoencoder)
model. In the second stage, we use the image-to-image framework of a latent
diffusion model (Versatile Diffusion) conditioned on predicted multimodal (text
and visual) features, to generate final reconstructed images. On the publicly
available Natural Scenes Dataset benchmark, our method outperforms previous
models both qualitatively and quantitatively. When applied to synthetic fMRI
patterns generated from individual ROI (region-of-interest) masks, our trained
model creates compelling ``ROI-optimal'' scenes consistent with neuroscientific
knowledge. Thus, the proposed methodology can have an impact on both applied
(e.g. brain-computer interface) and fundamental neuroscience.

the space of the $\mathsf{EFG}$ index answering pattern matching queries in

consecutive node labels, to linear in the size of the edge labels. Then, we
develop linear-time construction algorithms optimizing for different metrics:
we improve the existing linearithmic construction algorithms to $O(mn)$, by
solving the novel exclusive ancestor set problem on trees; we propose, for the
simplified gapless setting, an $O(mn)$-time solution minimizing the maximum

importance of understanding its mortality risks to design effective

nationwide study aimed at investigating risk factors for lung cancer. The study
employed computed tomography texture analysis (CTTA), which provides objective
measurements of texture patterns on CT scans, to quantify the mortality risks
of lung cancer patients. Partially linear Cox models are becoming a popular
tool for modeling survival outcomes, as they effectively handle both
established risk factors (such as age and other clinical factors) and new risk
factors (such as image features) in a single framework. The challenge in
identifying the texture features that impact cancer survival is due to their
sensitivity to factors such as scanner type, segmentation, and organ motion. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a novel Penalized Deep Partially Linear Cox
Model (Penalized DPLC), which incorporates the SCAD penalty to select
significant texture features and employs a deep neural network to estimate the
nonparametric component of the model accurately. We prove the convergence and
asymptotic properties of the estimator and compare it to other methods through
extensive simulation studies, evaluating its performance in risk prediction and
feature selection. The proposed method is applied to the NLST study dataset to
uncover the effects of key clinical and imaging risk factors on patients'

long-term individual and cooperative objectives by explicitly sharing their
intent (i.e., medium-/long-term future positions distribution, obtained from
their individual policy) in a reactive, asynchronous manner. That is, in our
work, intent sharing allows agents to learn to claim/avoid broader areas of the
world. Moreover, since our approach relies on learned attention over these
shared intents, agents are able to learn to recognize the useful portion(s) of
these (imperfect) predictions to maximize cooperation even in the presence of
imperfect information. Our comparison experiments demonstrate the performance
of our approach compared to its variants and high-quality baselines over a
large set of MAIPP simulations.

equitable vaccine distribution between high- and low-income countries.
High-income countries, such as the United States, were among the first to
acquire the rapidly developed vaccines against COVID-19. However, many such
high-income countries were reluctant or slow to distribute extra doses of the
vaccine to lower-income countries via the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access
(COVAX) collaboration [Clinton and Yoo 2022]. In addition to moral objections
to such vaccine nationalism, vaccine inequity during a pandemic could
contribute to the evolution of new variants of the virus and possibly increase
total deaths, including in the high-income countries. This paper uses the
COVID-19 pandemic as a case study to identify scenarios under which it might be
in a high-income nation's own interest to donate vaccine doses to another
country before its own population has been fully vaccinated. Using an
epidemiological model embedded in an optimization framework, we identify
realistic scenarios under which a donor country prefers to donate vaccines
before distributing them locally in order to minimize local deaths. We
demonstrate that a nondonor-first vaccination policy can, under some
circumstances, dramatically delay the emergence of more-contagious variants.
Moreover, we find that vaccine distribution is not a zero-sum game between
donor and nondonor countries: weighting the objective function even slightly in
favor of minimizing total deaths can achieve dramatic reduction in total deaths
with only a small increase in donor-country deaths. The insights yielded by
this framework can be used to guide equitable vaccine distribution in future
pandemics.

introduced ideas of replacing the deep structure of DNNs with ODEs as a

minimization of a ""loss"" constrained by a parametric ODE. Although the
existence of a minimizer for this minimization problem needs to be assumed,
only a few studies have investigated its existence analytically in detail. In
the present paper, the existence of a minimizer is discussed based on a
formulation of ODE-Net as a measure-theoretic mean-field optimal control
problem. The existence result is proved when a neural network, which describes
a vector field of ODE-Net, is linear with respect to learnable parameters. The
proof employs the measure-theoretic formulation combined with the direct method
of Calculus of Variations. Secondly, an idealized minimization problem is
proposed to remove the above linearity assumption. Such a problem is inspired
by a kinetic regularization associated with the Benamou--Brenier formula and
universal approximation theorems for neural networks. The proofs of these
existence results use variational methods, differential equations, and
mean-field optimal control theory. They will stand for a new analytic way to
investigate the learning process of deep neural networks.

visual pathways of primate and rodent. However, they highly simplify the
computational properties of neurons compared to their biological counterparts.
Instead, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are more biologically plausible models
since spiking neurons encode information with time sequences of spikes, just
like biological neurons do. However, there is a lack of studies on visual
pathways with deep SNNs models. In this study, we model the visual cortex with
deep SNNs for the first time, and also with a wide range of state-of-the-art
deep CNNs and ViTs for comparison. Using three similarity metrics, we conduct
neural representation similarity experiments on three neural datasets collected
from two species under three types of stimuli. Based on extensive similarity
analyses, we further investigate the functional hierarchy and mechanisms across
species. Almost all similarity scores of SNNs are higher than their
counterparts of CNNs with an average of 6.6%. Depths of the layers with the
highest similarity scores exhibit little differences across mouse cortical
regions, but vary significantly across macaque regions, suggesting that the
visual processing structure of mice is more regionally homogeneous than that of
macaques. Besides, the multi-branch structures observed in some top mouse
brain-like neural networks provide computational evidence of parallel
processing streams in mice, and the different performance in fitting macaque
neural representations under different stimuli exhibits the functional
specialization of information processing in macaques. Taken together, our study

  Multistate Analysis",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Objectives: We aim to quantify longitudinal acute kidney injury (AKI)
trajectories and to describe transitions through progressing and recovery
states and outcomes among hospitalized patients using multistate models.
Methods: In this large, longitudinal cohort study, 138,449 adult patients
admitted to a quaternary care hospital between 2012 and 2019 were staged based
on Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria for the
first 14 days of their hospital stay. We fit multistate models to estimate
probability of being in a certain clinical state at a given time after entering
each one of the AKI stages. We investigated the effects of selected variables
on transition rates via Cox proportional hazards regression models. Results:
Twenty percent of hospitalized encounters (49,325/246,964) had AKI; among
patients with AKI, 66% had Stage 1 AKI, 18% had Stage 2 AKI, and 17% had AKI
Stage 3 with or without RRT. At seven days following Stage 1 AKI, 69% (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 68.8%-70.5%) were either resolved to No AKI or
discharged, while smaller proportions of recovery (26.8%, 95% CI: 26.1%-27.5%)
and discharge (17.4%, 95% CI: 16.8%-18.0%) were observed following AKI Stage 2.
At 14 days following Stage 1 AKI, patients with more frail conditions (Charlson
comorbidity index greater than or equal to 3 and had prolonged ICU stay) had
lower proportion of transitioning to No AKI or discharge states. Discussion:
Multistate analyses showed that the majority of Stage 2 and higher severity AKI
patients could not resolve within seven days; therefore, strategies preventing
the persistence or progression of AKI would contribute to the patients' life
quality. Conclusions: We demonstrate multistate modeling framework's utility as
a mechanism for a better understanding of the clinical course of AKI with the
potential to facilitate treatment and resource planning.

using a formal language like linear temporal logic (LTL). In this paper, we
present a learning-based approach for translating from natural language
commands to LTL specifications with very limited human-labeled training data.
This is in stark contrast to existing natural-language to LTL translators,
which require large human-labeled datasets, often in the form of labeled pairs
of LTL formulas and natural language commands, to train the translator. To
reduce reliance on human data, our approach generates a large synthetic
training dataset through algorithmic generation of LTL formulas, conversion to
structured English, and then exploiting the paraphrasing capabilities of modern
large language models (LLMs) to synthesize a diverse corpus of natural language
commands corresponding to the LTL formulas. We use this generated data to
finetune an LLM and apply a constrained decoding procedure at inference time to
ensure the returned LTL formula is syntactically correct. We evaluate our
approach on three existing LTL/natural language datasets and show that we can
translate natural language commands at 75\% accuracy with far less human data
($\le$12 annotations). Moreover, when training on large human-annotated
datasets, our method achieves higher test accuracy (95\% on average) than prior
work. Finally, we show the translated formulas can be used to plan
long-horizon, multi-stage tasks on a 12D quadrotor.

to represent the question data. However, test questions (TQ) are usually
heterogeneous and multi-modal, e.g., some of them may only contain text, while
others half contain images with information beyond their literal description.
In this context, both supervised and unsupervised methods are difficult to
learn a fused representation of questions. Meanwhile, this problem cannot be
solved by conventional methods such as image caption, as the images may contain
information complementary rather than duplicate to the text. In this paper, we
first improve previous text-only representation with a two-stage unsupervised
instance level contrastive based pre-training method (MCL: Mixture Unsupervised
Contrastive Learning). Then, TQ-Net was proposed to fuse the content of images
to the representation of heterogeneous data. Finally, supervised contrastive
learning was conducted on relevance prediction-related downstream tasks, which
helped the model to learn the representation of questions effectively. We
conducted extensive experiments on question-based tasks on large-scale,

  Sim-to-real transfer utilizes image translation methods, which are divided

Paired image translation requires a perfect pixel match, making it difficult to
apply in practice due to the lack of pixel-wise correspondence between

  Learning","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2205.09542",,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present Unified Contrastive Arbitrary Style Transfer (UCAST), a novel
style representation learning and transfer framework, which can fit in most
existing arbitrary image style transfer models, e.g., CNN-based, ViT-based, and
flow-based methods. As the key component in image style transfer tasks, a
suitable style representation is essential to achieve satisfactory results.
Existing approaches based on deep neural network typically use second-order
statistics to generate the output. However, these hand-crafted features
computed from a single image cannot leverage style information sufficiently,
which leads to artifacts such as local distortions and style inconsistency. To
address these issues, we propose to learn style representation directly from a
large amount of images based on contrastive learning, by taking the
relationships between specific styles and the holistic style distribution into
account. Specifically, we present an adaptive contrastive learning scheme for
style transfer by introducing an input-dependent temperature. Our framework
consists of three key components, i.e., a parallel contrastive learning scheme
for style representation and style transfer, a domain enhancement module for
effective learning of style distribution, and a generative network for style
transfer. We carry out qualitative and quantitative evaluations to show that
our approach produces superior results than those obtained via state-of-the-art
methods.

  (AI2ASE), February 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Global warming is an urgent issue that is generating catastrophic
environmental changes, such as the melting of sea ice and glaciers,
particularly in the polar regions. The melting pattern and retreat of polar sea
ice cover is an essential indicator of global warming. The Sentinel-2 satellite
(S2) captures high-resolution optical imagery over the polar regions. This
research aims at developing a robust and effective system for classifying polar
sea ice as thick or snow-covered, young or thin, or open water using S2 images.
A key challenge is the lack of labeled S2 training data to serve as the ground
truth. We demonstrate a method with high precision to segment and automatically
label the S2 images based on suitably determined color thresholds and employ
these auto-labeled data to train a U-Net machine model (a fully convolutional
neural network), yielding good classification accuracy. Evaluation results over
S2 data from the polar summer season in the Ross Sea region of the Antarctic
show that the U-Net model trained on auto-labeled data has an accuracy of
90.18% over the original S2 images, whereas the U-Net model trained on manually
labeled data has an accuracy of 91.39%. Filtering out the thin clouds and
shadows from the S2 images further improves U-Net's accuracy, respectively, to
98.97% for auto-labeled and 98.40% for manually labeled training datasets.

Generative Adversarial Network can be modified using 'semiotics.' We show that
just as physical attributes such as the hue and saturation of an image can be
modified, so too can its non-physical, abstract properties using our method.
For example, the design of a flight attendant's uniform may be modified to look
more 'alert,' less 'austere,' or more 'practical.' The form of a house can be
modified to appear more 'futuristic,' a car more 'friendly' a pair of sneakers,
'evil.' Our method uncovers latent visual iconography associated with the
semiotic property of interest, enabling a process of visual form-finding using
abstract concepts. Our approach is iterative and allows control over the degree
of attribute presence and can be used to aid the design process to yield
emergent visual concepts.

over time, have been shown to encode key aspects of verb semantics (e.g., the
meanings of roll vs. slide). However, most multimodal models in NLP use 2D
images as representations of the world. Given the importance of 3D space in
formal models of verb semantics, we expect that these 2D images would result in
impoverished representations that fail to capture nuanced differences in
meaning. This paper tests this hypothesis directly in controlled experiments.
We train self-supervised image and trajectory encoders, and then evaluate them
on the extent to which each learns to differentiate verb concepts. Contrary to
our initial expectations, we find that 2D visual modalities perform similarly
well to 3D trajectories. While further work should be conducted on this
question, our initial findings challenge the conventional wisdom that richer
environment representations necessarily translate into better representation
learning for language.

neural networks currently play only a minor role. Optimizing abstract features
such as automation capability is challenging, since they can be very difficult
to simulate, are too complex for rule-based systems, and also have little to no
data available for machine-learning methods. On the other hand, image
manipulation methods that can manipulate abstract features in images such as
StyleCLIP have seen much success. They rely on the latent space of pretrained
generative adversarial networks, and could therefore also make use of the vast
amount of unlabeled CAD data. In this paper, we show that such an approach is
also suitable for optimizing abstract automation-related features of CAD parts.
We achieved this by extending StyleCLIP to work with CAD models in the form of
voxel models, which includes using a 3D StyleGAN and a custom classifier.
Finally, we demonstrate the ability of our system for the optimiziation of
automation-related features by optimizing the grabability of various CAD
models. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license

having pivotal applications in many fields such as credibility assessment in
business, multimedia anti-frauds, and custom security. Despite this, deception
detection research is hindered by the lack of high-quality deception datasets,
as well as the difficulties of learning multimodal features effectively. To
address this issue, we introduce DOLOS, the largest gameshow deception
detection dataset with rich deceptive conversations. DOLOS includes 1,675 video
clips featuring 213 subjects, and it has been labeled with audio-visual feature
annotations. We provide train-test, duration, and gender protocols to
investigate the impact of different factors. We benchmark our dataset on
previously proposed deception detection approaches. To further improve the
performance by fine-tuning fewer parameters, we propose Parameter-Efficient
Crossmodal Learning (PECL), where a Uniform Temporal Adapter (UT-Adapter)
explores temporal attention in transformer-based architectures, and a
crossmodal fusion module, Plug-in Audio-Visual Fusion (PAVF), combines
crossmodal information from audio-visual features. Based on the rich
fine-grained audio-visual annotations on DOLOS, we also exploit multi-task
learning to enhance performance by concurrently predicting deception and
audio-visual features. Experimental results demonstrate the desired quality of
the DOLOS dataset and the effectiveness of the PECL. The DOLOS dataset and the
source codes will be publicly available soon.

concrete structures subjected to earthquake ground motions, especially when
simulating seismic events strong enough to cause collapse. This paper addresses
two of the most significant barriers to improving nonlinear modeling provisions
in seismic evaluation standards using experimental data sets: identifying the
most likely mode of failure of structural components, and implementing data
fitting techniques capable of recognizing interdependencies between input
parameters and nonlinear relationships between input parameters and model
outputs. Machine learning tools in the Scikit-learn and Pytorch libraries were
used to calibrate equations and black-box numerical models for nonlinear
modeling parameters (MP) a and b of reinforced concrete columns defined in the
ASCE 41 and ACI 369.1 standards, and to estimate their most likely mode of
failure. It was found that machine learning regression models and machine
learning black-boxes were more accurate than current provisions in the ACI
369.1/ASCE 41 Standards. Among the regression models, Regularized Linear
Regression was the most accurate for estimating MP a, and Polynomial Regression
was the most accurate for estimating MP b. The two black-box models evaluated,
namely the Gaussian Process Regression and the Neural Network (NN), provided
the most accurate estimates of MPs a and b. The NN model was the most accurate
machine learning tool of all evaluated. A multi-class classification tool from
the Scikit-learn machine learning library correctly identified column mode of
failure with 79% accuracy for rectangular columns and with 81% accuracy for
circular columns, a substantial improvement over the classification rules in
ASCE 41-13.

engineered systems, we have seen significant recent computationally driven
advances in sensing and control. And, there has been a growing interest -
inspired in part by the incredible distributed and emergent functionality
observed in the natural world - in exploring the ability of engineered systems
to perform computation through mechanisms that are fundamentally driven by
physical laws. In this work, we focus on a small segment of this broad and
evolving field: locality sensitive hashing via mechanical behavior.
Specifically, we will address the question: can mechanical information (i.e.,
loads) be transformed by mechanical systems (i.e., converted into sensor
readouts) such that the mechanical system meets the requirements for a locality
sensitive hash function? Overall, we not only find that mechanical systems are
able to perform this function, but also that different mechanical systems vary
widely in their efficacy at this task. Looking forward, we view this work as a
starting point for significant future investigation into the design and
optimization of mechanical systems for conveying mechanical information for
downstream computing.

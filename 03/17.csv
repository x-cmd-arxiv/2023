models, inconsistent or contradictory answers continue to cast doubt on their
true reasoning capabilities. However, most proposed methods use indirect
strategies or strong assumptions on pairs of questions and answers to enforce
model consistency. Instead, we propose a novel strategy intended to improve
model performance by directly reducing logical inconsistencies. To do this, we
introduce a new consistency loss term that can be used by a wide range of the
VQA models and which relies on knowing the logical relation between pairs of
questions and answers. While such information is typically not available in VQA
datasets, we propose to infer these logical relations using a dedicated
language model and use these in our proposed consistency loss function. We
conduct extensive experiments on the VQA Introspect and DME datasets and show
that our method brings improvements to state-of-the-art VQA models, while being
robust across different architectures and settings.

size that is meaningfully large, negligibly small, or inconclusively broad.
Previously, we proposed contra-analysis as a decision-making process to help
determine which interventions have a meaningfully large effect by using contra
plots to compare effect size across broadly related experiments. Here, we
extend the use of contra plots to determine which results have evidence of
negligible (near-zero) effect size. Determining if an effect size is negligible
is important for eliminating alternative scientific explanations and
identifying approximate independence between an intervention and the variable
measured. We illustrate that contra plots can score negligible effect size
across studies, inform the selection of a threshold for negligible effect based
on broadly related results, and determine which results have evidence of
negligible effect with a hypothesis test. No other data visualization can carry
out all three of these tasks for analyzing negligible effect size. We
demonstrate this analysis technique on real data from biomedical research. This
new application of contra plots can differentiate statistically insignificant
results with high strength (narrow and near-zero interval estimate of effect
size) from those with low strength (broad interval estimate of effect size).
Such a designation could help resolve the File Drawer problem in science, where
statistically insignificant results are underreported because their
interpretation is ambiguous and nonstandard. With our proposed procedure,
results designated with negligible effect will be considered strong and
publishable evidence of near-zero effect size.

introducing Large Scale Composed Image Retrieval (LaSCo), a new CoIR dataset
x10 times larger than current ones. Pre-training on LaSCo yields a further
performance boost. We further suggest a new analysis of CoIR datasets and

has recently made a big leap forward. At the core, NeRF proposes that each 3D

differentiable volumetric rendering. While neural radiance fields can
accurately represent 3D scenes for computing the image rendering, 3D meshes are
still the main scene representation supported by most computer graphics and
simulation pipelines, enabling tasks such as real time rendering and
physics-based simulations. Obtaining 3D meshes from neural radiance fields
still remains an open challenge since NeRFs are optimized for view synthesis,
not enforcing an accurate underlying geometry on the radiance field. We thus
propose a novel compact and flexible architecture that enables easy 3D surface
reconstruction from any NeRF-driven approach. Upon having trained the radiance
field, we distill the volumetric 3D representation into a Signed Surface
Approximation Network, allowing easy extraction of the 3D mesh and appearance.
Our final 3D mesh is physically accurate and can be rendered in real time on an

tenuous proposition that ""whiteness'' is sufficiently well defined to observe,
their study lacks the proper controls, checks, and consistent methodology to
allow for the confirmation or disconfirmation of the asserted interpretation of
the data. The work does not provide a consistency check of the interpretations
and lacks sufficient data to give any type of statistical reliability estimate.
It also contains no evidence that analysis of a single video segment captures
typical interactions in introductory physics classes. We argue that the work
does not meet even the requirements for a qualitative study as the authors do
not consider alternative interpretations or other hypotheses for explaining the
observations, nor do they describe how to conduct studies that could confirm or
contradict the results. In particular, whiteness is so poorly defined that it
is not possible to show that whiteness is absent. The authors make the stunning
claim that their study cannot be judged by the scientific standards used in

completely incompatible with quantitative and qualitative scientific studies.
If the work cannot be evaluated by scientific standards, then it is not a

the utility of its intermediate representations. One way to elucidate this is
to cast the hidden representations as final representations, bypassing the
transformer computation in-between. In this work, we suggest a simple method
for such casting, by using linear transformations. We show that our approach
produces more accurate approximations than the prevailing practice of
inspecting hidden representations from all layers in the space of the final
layer. Moreover, in the context of language modeling, our method allows
""peeking"" into early layer representations of GPT-2 and BERT, showing that
often LMs already predict the final output in early layers. We then demonstrate
the practicality of our method to recent early exit strategies, showing that
when aiming, for example, at retention of 95% accuracy, our approach saves
additional 7.9% layers for GPT-2 and 5.4% layers for BERT, on top of the
savings of the original approach. Last, we extend our method to linearly

all relations among the balanced multiple q-zeta values are conjecturally of a

classical Eisenstein series, and they also contain the combinatorial multiple

driven by neutrino heating, principally due to neutrino capture on free
neutrons and protons. Such neutrino interaction plays a crucial role for
setting neutron richness in the ejecta. Recent hydrodynamics work with
sophisticated neutrino transport indicates that the ejecta are only mildly
neutron rich or even proton rich. In such conditions a wide variety of
trans-iron isotopes are synthesized, while the neutron richness is insufficient
for the production of r-process nuclei. In this capter, basic concepts of
nucleosynthesis in neutrino-heated ejecta and neutrino-driven winds of
core-collapse supernovae are presented along with latest studies.
Neutrino-heated ejecta indicate the early ejecta component within the first few
seocnds in which anisotropic convective activities of material above the
neutrinosphere become important for nucleosynthesis. Then, neutrino-driven
winds follow, which are approximately isotropic outflows emerging from the
surface of a proto-neutron star . According to such characteristics, studies of
nucleosynthesis here are based on recent multi-dimentional hydrodynamics
simulations and semi-alalytic wind solutions, respectively. These studies
suggest that trans-iron species up to the atomic mass number of 90, as well as
some rare isotopes such as 48Ca and 92Mo, are produced in the neutrino-heated
ejecta. Neutrino-driven winds are unlikely sources of r-process nuclei, but
rather promising sources of proton-rich isotopes up to the atomic number of

selection, solving subtrees, and the UCT formula. We test all possible
combinations on different time settings, playing against vanilla UCT MCTS on
several games: Lines of Action ($7$$\times$$7$ and $8$$\times$$8$), MiniShogi,
Knightthrough, Awari, and Gomoku. Furthermore, we extend this new algorithm to
properly address games with draws, like Awari, by adding an additional layer of
PNS on top of the MCTS tree. The experiments show that PN-MCTS confidently
outperforms MCTS in 5 out of 6 game domains (all except Gomoku), achieving win
rates up to 96.2% for Lines of Action.

integrodifferential equation for filling in missing structures in images. It
combines two carefully chosen components that have proven their usefulness in
different applications: homogeneous diffusion inpainting and
coherence-enhancing shock filtering. DS inpainting enjoys the complementary
synergy of its building blocks: It offers a high degree of anisotropy along an
eigendirection of the structure tensor. This enables it to connect interrupted
structures over large distances. Moreover, it benefits from the sharp edge
structure generated by the shock filter, and it exploits the efficient
filling-in effect of homogeneous diffusion. The second order equation that
underlies DS inpainting inherits a continuous maximum-minimum principle from
its constituents. In contrast to other attractive second order inpainting
equations such as edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion, we can guarantee this
property also for the proposed discrete algorithm. Our experiments show a
performance that is comparable to or better than many linear or nonlinear,
isotropic or anisotropic processes of second or fourth order. They include
homogeneous diffusion, biharmonic interpolation, TV inpainting, edge-enhancing
anisotropic diffusion, the methods of Tschumperl\'e and of Bornemann and

that such MontePython forecasts agree very well with previous Fisher forecasts
published by the Euclid Collaboration, and also, with new forecasts produced by

  Enhancing Safety in Mixed-Vehicle Platooning Control","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.04665",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become more prevalent on public roads, they will
inevitably interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in mixed traffic
scenarios. To ensure safe interactions between AVs and HVs, it is crucial to
account for the uncertain behaviors of HVs when developing control strategies
for AVs. In this paper, we propose an efficient learning-based modeling
approach for HVs that combines a first-principles model with a Gaussian process
(GP) learning-based component. The GP model corrects the velocity prediction of
the first-principles model and estimates its uncertainty. Utilizing this model,
a model predictive control (MPC) strategy, referred to as GP-MPC, was designed
to enhance the safe control of a mixed vehicle platoon by integrating the
uncertainty assessment into the distance constraint. We compare our GP-MPC
strategy with a baseline MPC that uses only the first-principles model in
simulation studies. We show that our GP-MPC strategy provides more robust safe
distance guarantees and enables more efficient travel behaviors (higher travel
speeds) for all vehicles in the mixed platoon. Moreover, by incorporating a
sparse GP technique in HV modeling and a dynamic GP prediction in MPC, we
achieve an average computation time for GP-MPC at each time step that is only
5% longer than the baseline MPC, which is approximately 100 times faster than
our previous work that did not use these approximations. This work demonstrates
how learning-based modeling of HVs can enhance safety and efficiency in mixed
traffic involving AV-HV interaction.

connected components, corresponding to the odd and even permutations of the

beyond the $4\times 4$ grid to arbitrary graphs (considering $n-1$ sliding
blocks on a graph with $n$ vertices), and characterised the graphs for which
the corresponding configuration space is connected.
  In this work, we extend Wilson's characterisation to sliding block puzzles
with an arbitrary number of blocks (potentially leaving more than one empty
vertex). For any graph, we determine how many empty vertices are necessary to
connect the corresponding configuration space, and more generally we provide an
algorithm to determine whether any two configurations are connected. Our work

everyday driving scenarios, further safety and performance improvements of
autonomous vehicles require a focus on extreme driving conditions. In this
context, autonomous racing is a new area of research that has been attracting
considerable interest recently. Due to the fact that a vehicle is driven by its
perception, planning, and control limits during racing, numerous research and
development issues arise. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the
autonomous racing system built by team KAIST for the Indy Autonomous Challenge
(IAC). Our autonomy stack consists primarily of a multi-modal perception
module, a high-speed overtaking planner, a resilient control stack, and a
system status manager. We present the details of all components of our autonomy
solution, including algorithms, implementation, and unit test results. In
addition, this paper outlines the design principles and the results of a
systematical analysis. Even though our design principles are derived from the
unique application domain of autonomous racing, they can also be applied to a
variety of safety-critical, high-cost-of-failure robotics applications. The
proposed system was integrated into a full-scale autonomous race car (Dallara
AV-21) and field-tested extensively. As a result, team KAIST was one of three
teams who qualified and participated in the official IAC race events without
any accidents. Our proposed autonomous system successfully completed all
missions, including overtaking at speeds of around $220 km/h$ in the
IAC@CES2022, the world's first autonomous 1:1 head-to-head race.

various quantum experiments and in particular in the field of matter-wave
interferometry. The initial tight confinement results in a very fast expansion
of the wave function at later times which significantly complicates an
efficient and precise numerical evaluation. In many practical cases the
expansion time is too short for the validity of the stationary phase
approximation and too long for an efficient application of Fourier
collocation-based methods. We develop an alternative method based on a
discretization of the free-particle propagator. This simple approach yields
highly accurate results which readily follows from the exceptionally fast
convergence of the trapezoidal rule approximation of integrals involving smooth
and rapidly decaying functions. We discuss and analyze our approach in detail
and demonstrate how to estimate the numerical error in the one-dimensional
setting. Furthermore, we show that by exploiting the separability of the
Green's function, the numerical effort of the multi-dimensional approximation
is considerably reduced. Our method is very fast, highly accurate, and easy to
implement on modern hardware.

transformation of grain boundary phases. The atomistic structure of a symmetric
tilt grain boundary in Mg was resolved by high resolution scanning transmission
electron microscopy. By introducing Ga atoms to the grain boundary,
transformations towards other grain boundary phases were tracked. Ab initio
simulations were performed to construct the defect phase diagram for the grain
boundary and understand the progress of their phase transformations. A pattern
recognition tool was developed to compare the experimental and simulated
structural units at the grain boundary and automatically trace the phase
transformation. The ability to construct defect phase diagrams and tune their
phase transformations without changing the geometric confinement of defects
enables a new paradigm of material designs.

running massive iterations on a large model to estimate whole images or feature

(DiffIR), which consists of a compact IR prior extraction network (CPEN),

ground-truth images into CPEN$_{S1}$ to capture a compact IR prior

to directly estimate the same IRP as pretrained CPEN$_{S1}$ only using LQ

generate more stable and realistic results. Since the iterations are few, our
DiffIR can adopt a joint optimization of CPEN$_{S2}$, DIRformer, and denoising

These so-called `super spirals' are ideal objects to better understand how

between stars and gas to a higher stellar mass regime. We present new CO(1-0)
data for a sample of 46 super spirals and for 18 slightly lower-mass

(HI-FRs). We analyze their molecular gas mass, derived from CO, in relation to
their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass, and compare the results to
values and scaling relations derived from lower-mass galaxies. We confirm that
super spirals follow the same star-forming main sequence (SFMS) as lower-mass
galaxies. We find that they possess abundant molecular gas, which lies above
the extrapolation of the scaling relation with stellar mass derived from
lower-mass galaxies, but within the relation between \mmol/\mstar and the
distance to the SFMS. The molecular gas depletion time, \taudep = \mmol/SFR, is
higher than for lower-mass galaxies on the SFMS (\taudep = 9.30 $\pm$ 0.03,
compared to \taudep = 9.00 $\pm$ 0.02 for the comparison sample) and seems to
continue an increasing trend with stellar mass. HI-FR galaxies have an
atomic-to-molecular gas mass ratio that is in agreement with that of lower-mass
galaxies, indicating that the conversion from the atomic to molecular gas
proceeds in a similar way. We conclude that the availability of molecular gas
is a crucial factor to enable star formation to continue and that, if gas is
present, quenching is not a necessary destiny for high-mass galaxies. The
difference in gas depletion time suggests that the properties of the molecular
gas at high stellar masses are less favorable for star formation.

expensive bi-level optimisation schemes to update these meta-parameters.
Ideally, systems should perform multiple orders of meta-learning, i.e. to learn

standard meta-learning techniques are often inappropriate for these

an application, we use holomorphic Hamiltonian systems to establish a relation
between Lefschetz fibrations and almost toric fibrations. During the
investigation of action functionals for holomorphic Hamiltonian systems, we
observe that the complex structure $J$ corresponding to a holomorphic
Hamiltonian system poses strong restrictions on the existence of certain
trajectories. For instance, no non-trivial holomorphic trajectories with
complex tori as domains can exist in $\mathbb{C}^{2n}$ due to the maximum
principle. To lift this restriction, we generalize the notion of holomorphic
Hamiltonian systems to systems with non-integrable almost complex structures
$J$ leading us to the definition of pseudo-holomorphic Hamiltonian systems. We
show that these systems exhibit properties very similar to their holomorphic

Furthermore, we prove that the integrability of $J$ is equivalent to the
closedness of the ""pseudo-holomorphic symplectic"" form. Lastly, we show that,

biological effectiveness (RBE) with fractionation from clinical data of tumor
control probability (TCP) and to apply it to study the response of prostate
cancer to proton therapy.
  Methods: We have analyzed the dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction
by using the LQ model and the Poisson TCP formalism. Experimental TCPs for
prostate cancer (low risk, LR, and intermediate risk, IR) treated with photon
and proton therapy for conventional fractionation (2 GyE$\times$37 fractions),
moderate hypofractionation (3 GyE$\times$20 fractions) and hypofractionation
(7.25 GyE$\times$5 fractions) were obtained from the literature and analyzed.
  Results: The dependence of the RBE on the dose per fraction presents three
theoretical regions, with RBE monotonically decreasing, increasing or constant
with the dose per fraction, depending on the change of ($\alpha$, $\beta$)
values between photon and proton irradiation (the equilibrium point being at
($\alpha_p$/$\beta_p$)=($\alpha_X$/$\beta_X$)($\alpha_X$/$\alpha_p$)). An
analysis of the clinical data shows RBE values that decline with increasing
dose per fraction: for LR RBE=1.124, 1.119, and 1.102 for 1.82 Gy, 2.73 Gy and
6.59 Gy per fraction (proton doses), respectively; for IR RBE=1.119, and 1.102

  Conclusions: Our analysis shows a monotonically decreasing RBE with
increasing dose per fraction for prostate cancer, which is expected from the LQ
formalism and the changes in ($\alpha$, $\beta$) between photon and proton
irradiation. However, due to the limited number of schedules and patients per
schedule, the observed decrease of RBE with increasing dose is not significant
for LR prostate cancer. For IR prostate cancer, the RBE obtained at 7.25 GyE
seems to be significantly lower than that obtained at 2 GyE.

deep learning layers for efficient sequence modeling. However, we find
fundamental limitations with these prior approaches, proving their SSM

introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves
all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization
based on the companion matrix -- a canonical representation for discrete-time

autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a
""closed-loop"" variation of the companion SSM, which enables SpaceTime to
predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For
efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the

that causes a substantial increase in measured viscosity with increasing shear,
and an attractive interaction between particles, leading to their chaining. At
even higher shear rates, the flow becomes unstable, even in the absence of
particles. This instability makes it very difficult to determine the properties
of a particle suspension. Here we use a fully immersed parallel plate geometry
to measure the high-shear-rate behavior of a suspension of particles in a
viscoelastic fluid. We find an unexpected separation of the particles within
the suspension resulting in the formation of a layer of particles in the center
of the cell. Remarkably, monodisperse particles form a crystalline layer which
dramatically alters the shear instability. By combining measurements of the
velocity field and torque fluctuations, we show that this solid layer disrupts
the flow instability and introduces a new, single-frequency component to the

Yet, their intricate architectural design and high computational complexity
make deploying them in clinical settings challenging, particularly with devices
with limited resources. To deal with this issue, Knowledge Distillation (KD)
has been proposed as a compression method and an acceleration technology. KD is
an efficient learning strategy that can transfer knowledge from a burdensome
model (i.e., teacher model) to a lightweight model (i.e., student model). Hence
we can obtain a compact model with low parameters with preserving the teacher's
performance. Therefore, we develop a KD-based deep model for prostate MRI
segmentation in this work by combining features-based distillation with
Kullback-Leibler divergence, Lovasz, and Dice losses. We further demonstrate
its effectiveness by applying two compression procedures: 1) distilling
knowledge to a student model from a single well-trained teacher, and 2) since
most of the medical applications have a small dataset, we train multiple
teachers that each one trained with a small set of images to learn an adaptive
student model as close to the teachers as possible considering the desired
accuracy and fast inference time. Extensive experiments were conducted on a
public multi-site prostate tumor dataset, showing that the proposed adaptation
KD strategy improves the dice similarity score by 9%, outperforming all tested
well-established baseline models.

its training requires the often-unknown attacking mechanism. Differently, we

consensus rather than dissensus in results compared to individual perception.
This leads to our hypothesize-and-verify framework: perception results with and
without collaboration from a random subset of teammates are compared until
reaching a consensus. In such a framework, more teammates in the sampled subset
often entail better perception performance but require longer sampling time to
reject potential attackers. Thus, we derive how many sampling trials are needed
to ensure the desired size of an attacker-free subset, or equivalently, the
maximum size of such a subset that we can successfully sample within a given
number of trials. We validate our method on the task of collaborative 3D object
detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

possible presence of a planetary magnetic field up to 1 G. For a low stellar
EUV emission, which is favoured by the measured logR'HK value, the HeI
non-detection can be explained by a solar He/H abundance ratio in combination
with a strong stellar wind, or by a sub-solar He/H abundance ratio, or by a
combination of the two. For a high stellar EUV emission, the non-detection
implies a sub-solar He/H abundance ratio. A planetary magnetic field is
unlikely to be the cause of the non-detection. The low EUV stellar flux, driven
by the low [Fe/O] coronal abundance, is the likely primary cause of the HeI
non-detection. High-quality EUV spectra of nearby stars are urgently needed to
improve the accuracy of high-energy emission estimates, which would then enable

different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like
the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric
escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve

\textit{polar-based} codes generated by the two schemes inherit several
fundamental properties of polar codes with the original $2 \times 2$ kernel

capacity-achieving property. Furthermore, they demonstrate the additional
property that their GM column weights are bounded from above sublinearly in

time-domain log-sensitivity and a recently introduced robustness infidelity

Monte-Carlo sampling. In this work, the correlation between the log-sensitivity
and the RIM for evaluating the robustness of single excitation transfer
fidelity in spin chains and rings in the presence of dephasing is investigated.
We show that the expected differential sensitivity of the error agrees with the
differential sensitivity of the RIM, where the expectation is over the error
probability distribution. Statistical analysis also demonstrates that the
log-sensitivity and the RIM are linked via the differential sensitivity, and
that the differential sensitivity and RIM are highly concordant. This
unification of two means (one analytic and one via sampling) to assess

(VBMC) algorithm for posterior and model inference for black-box computational
models (Acerbi, 2018, 2020). VBMC is an approximate inference method designed
for efficient parameter estimation and model assessment when model evaluations
are mildly-to-very expensive (e.g., a second or more) and/or noisy.
Specifically, VBMC computes:
  - a flexible (non-Gaussian) approximate posterior distribution of the model
parameters, from which statistics and posterior samples can be easily
extracted;
  - an approximation of the model evidence or marginal likelihood, a metric
used for Bayesian model selection.
  PyVBMC can be applied to any computational or statistical model with up to
roughly 10-15 continuous parameters, with the only requirement that the user
can provide a Python function that computes the target log likelihood of the
model, or an approximation thereof (e.g., an estimate of the likelihood
obtained via simulation or Monte Carlo methods). PyVBMC is particularly
effective when the model takes more than about a second per evaluation, with
dramatic speed-ups of 1-2 orders of magnitude when compared to traditional
approximate inference methods.
  Extensive benchmarks on both artificial test problems and a large number of
real models from the computational sciences, particularly computational and
cognitive neuroscience, show that VBMC generally - and often vastly -
outperforms alternative methods for sample-efficient Bayesian inference, and is
applicable to both exact and simulator-based models (Acerbi, 2018, 2019, 2020).
PyVBMC brings this state-of-the-art inference algorithm to Python, along with
an easy-to-use Pythonic interface for running the algorithm and manipulating

three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from a single sequence of two-dimensional

axis is divided into smaller equal sub-parts which are then reconstructed using
edge preserved kriging interpolation to predict the missing slice information.
In order to speed up the process of interpolation, we have used multiprocessing
by carrying out the initial interpolation on parallel cores. From the 3D matrix
thus formed, shearlet transform is applied to estimate the edges considering
the 2D blocks along the $Z$ axis, and to minimize the blurring effect using a
proposed mean-median logic. Finally, for visualization, the sub-matrices are
merged into a final 3D matrix. Next, the newly formed 3D matrix is split up

from the known online algorithms for arbitrary set systems).
  For both dynamic set cover and hitting set with $d$-dimensional
hyperrectangles, we obtain $(\log m)^{O(d)}$-approximation algorithms with
$(\log m)^{O(d)}$ worst-case update time. This partially answers an open
question posed by Chan et al. [SODA'22]. Previously, no dynamic algorithms with
polylogarithmic update time were known even in the setting of squares (for
either of these problems). Our main technical contributions are an
\emph{extended quad-tree }approach and a \emph{frequency reduction} technique
that reduces geometric set cover instances to instances of general set cover
with bounded frequency.

guided algorithms for privacy-preserving machine learning tasks. However, the

that the classical collaborative filtering method, trained by differentially
private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), results in a disparate impact on
user groups with respect to different user engagement levels. This, in turn,
causes the original unfair model to become even more biased against inactive

framework for collaborative filtering based algorithms. Specifically, it
combines differential privacy mechanisms with fairness constraints to protect
user privacy while ensuring fair recommendations. The experimental results,

superior performance in terms of both overall accuracy and user group fairness

express sequential decision-making under dense-time and stochastic
environments. When the stochastic evolution of the environment is only
available via sampling, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) is the
algorithm-of-choice to compute optimal decision sequence. RL, on the other
hand, requires the learning objective to be encoded as scalar reward signals.
Since doing such translations manually is both tedious and error-prone, a
number of techniques have been proposed to translate high-level objectives
(expressed in logic or automata formalism) to scalar rewards for discrete-time
Markov decision processes (MDPs). Unfortunately, no automatic translation
exists for CTMDPs.
  We consider CTMDP environments against the learning objectives expressed as
omega-regular languages. Omega-regular languages generalize regular languages
to infinite-horizon specifications and can express properties given in popular
linear-time logic LTL. To accommodate the dense-time nature of CTMDPs, we
consider two different semantics of omega-regular objectives: 1) satisfaction
semantics where the goal of the learner is to maximize the probability of
spending positive time in the good states, and 2) expectation semantics where
the goal of the learner is to optimize the long-run expected average time spent
in the ``good states"" of the automaton. We present an approach enabling correct
translation to scalar reward signals that can be readily used by off-the-shelf
RL algorithms for CTMDPs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms by evaluating it on some popular CTMDP benchmarks with omega-regular
objectives.

introducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Yet

less transferable in the sense that the trained model often performs very
poorly when there is a domain gap between training and test datasets. This
paper proposes an unsupervised CD method based on deep metric learning that can
deal with both of these issues. Given an MT-RSI, the proposed method generates
corresponding change probability map by iteratively optimizing an unsupervised
CD loss without training it on a large dataset. Our unsupervised CD method
consists of two interconnected deep networks, namely Deep-Change Probability
Generator (D-CPG) and Deep-Feature Extractor (D-FE). The D-CPG is designed to
predict change and no change probability maps for a given MT-RSI, while D-FE is
used to extract deep features of MT-RSI that will be further used in the
proposed unsupervised CD loss. We use transfer learning capability to
initialize the parameters of D-FE. We iteratively optimize the parameters of
D-CPG and D-FE for a given MT-RSI by minimizing the proposed unsupervised
``similarity-dissimilarity loss''. This loss is motivated by the principle of
metric learning where we simultaneously maximize the distance between change
pair-wise pixels while minimizing the distance between no-change pair-wise
pixels in bi-temporal image domain and their deep feature domain. The

$\mathbb{R}^d$ and $D\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain. This paper
presents a proof, based on the classical Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger inequalities
for multiple integrals, that the distribution of the first exit time of $A_t$
from $D$ increases under Steiner symmetrization. Further, it is shown that when
a sequence of domains $\{D_m\}$ satisfying the $\varepsilon$-cone condition
converges to a domain $D'$ with respect to the Hausdorff metric, the
distributions of exit times for Brownian motion from $D_m$ converge to the
distribution of the exit time of Brownian motion from $D'$. These results are
applied to distributions of the first exit time from triangles and
quadrilaterals in the plane to show that they are maximized by the respective
first exit time distributions for the equilateral triangle and square by
extending a classical result of P\'olya and Szeg\""o.

Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which occurs between 70-500 d. We double the existing
sample of SNe Ia observed during the late-time near-infrared plateau with new
observations taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, Gemini, New Technology
Telescope, the 3.5m Calar Alto Telescope, and the Nordic Optical Telescope. Our
sample consists of 24 nearby SNe Ia at redshift < 0.025. We are able to confirm
that no plateau exists in the Ks band for most normal SNe Ia. SNe Ia with
broader optical light curves at peak tend to have a higher average brightness
on the plateau in J and H, most likely due to a shallower decline in the
preceding 100 d. SNe Ia that are more luminous at peak also show a steeper
decline during the plateau phase in H. We compare our data to state-of-the-art
radiative transfer models of nebular SNe Ia in the near-infrared. We find good
agreement with the sub-Mch model that has reduced non-thermal ionisation rates,
but no physical justification for reducing these rates has yet been proposed.
An analysis of the spectral evolution during the plateau demonstrates that the
ratio of [Fe II] to [Fe III] contribution in a near-infrared filter determines
the light curve evolution in said filter. We find that overluminous SNe decline
slower during the plateau than expected from the trend seen for normal SNe Ia

further extend this method to cover a subset of Horndeski theories that evade
the bound on the speed of gravitational waves set by the binary neutron star

gravitational coupling that is time and scale dependent, $G_{\rm

screening of the fifth-force. This is a fast procedure that when contrasted to
the alternative of solving the full equation of motion for the scalar field
inside N-body codes, reduces considerably the computational time and complexity
required to run simulations. To test the validity of this approach in the
non-linear regime, we have implemented it in a COmoving Lagrangian
Approximation (COLA) N-body code, and ran simulations for two gravity models
that have full N-body simulation outputs available in the literature, nDGP and
Cubic Galileon. We validate the combination of the COLA method with this
implementation of the Vainshtein mechanism with full N-body simulations for
predicting the boost function: the ratio between the modified gravity
non-linear matter power spectrum and its General Relativity counterpart. This
quantity is of great importance for building emulators in beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
models, and we find that the method described in this work has an agreement of
below $2\%$ for scales down to $k \approx 3h/$Mpc with respect to full N-body
simulations.

dense occupancy ground truth without expansive occupancy annotations.
Specifically, we fuse multi-frame LiDAR scans of dynamic objects and static
scenes separately. Then we adopt Poisson Reconstruction to fill the holes and
voxelize the mesh to get dense occupancy labels. Extensive experiments on
nuScenes and SemanticKITTI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.

mass ratios. Intrinsic binary parameters are accurately measured, but the sky
localisation is poor generally. Only $\sim 40\%$ of these high-redshift sources
have sky localisation better than $10\,\mathrm{deg}^2$. Merging BHs are hard to
detect in the restframe UV since they are fainter than the host galaxies, which
at high $z$ are star-forming. A significant fraction, $15-35\%$, of BH mergers
instead outshines the galaxy in X-rays, and about $5-15\%$ are sufficiently
bright to be detected with sensitive X-ray instruments. If mergers induce an
Eddington-limited brightening, up to $30\%$ of sources can become observable.
The transient flux change originating from such a brightening is often large,
allowing $4-20\%$ of mergers to be detected as EM counterparts. A fraction
$1-30\%$ of mergers is also detectable at radio frequencies. Observable merging
BHs tend to have higher accretion rates and masses and are overmassive at fixed
galaxy mass with respect to the full population. Most EM-observable mergers can
also be GW-detected with LISA, but their sky localisation is generally poorer.
This has to be considered when using EM counterparts to obtain information
about the properties of merging BHs and their environment.

spontaneous breaking of charge and/or dipole symmetry. When charge symmetry is
spontaneously broken, the hydrodynamic modes are quadratically propagating and
quartically relaxing ($\omega \sim \pm k^2 - ik^4$). When the dipole symmetry
is spontaneously broken but the charge symmetry is preserved, then we find
quadratically relaxing (diffusive) transverse modes, plus another mode which
depending on parameters may be either purely diffusive ($\omega \sim -i k^2$)
or quadratically propagating and quadratically relaxing ($\omega \sim \pm k^2
-i k^2$). Our work provides concrete predictions that may be tested in
near-term cold atom experiments, and also lays out a general framework that may
be applied to study systems with spontaneously broken multipolar symmetries.

phenomenological adjustments to self-consistently account for the low-energy
extinction, the Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$ fluorescent emission lines, the Fe
K edge, and the Compton-scattered continuum from the obscuring material. The
spherical geometry is not a unique description, however, and the
self-consistent, solar abundance MYTORUS model, applied with toroidal and
non-toroidal geometries, gives equally good descriptions of the data. In all
cases, the key features of the spectrum are so tightly locked together that for
a wide range of parameters, a relativistic disk-reflection component
contributes no more than $\sim$2% to the net spectrum in the 2-20 keV band. We
show that the commonly invoked explanations for weak X-ray reflection features,
namely a truncated and/or very highly ionized disk, do not work for NGC 4388.
If relativistically-broadened Fe K$\alpha$ lines and reflection are ubiquitous
in Seyfert 1 galaxies, they should also be ubiquitous in Compton-thin Seyfert 2

a given Hausdorff error $\varepsilon$. It is known from classical results of
Dudley (1974) and Bronshteyn and Ivanov (1976) that
$\Theta((\Delta/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$ vertices (alternatively, facets) are
both necessary and sufficient. While this bound is tight in the worst case,
that of Euclidean balls, it is far from optimal for skinny convex bodies.
  A natural way to characterize a convex object's skinniness is in terms of its
relationship to the Euclidean ball. Given a convex body $K$, define its
\emph{volume diameter} $\Delta_d$ to be the diameter of a Euclidean ball of the
same volume as $K$, and define its \emph{surface diameter} $\Delta_{d-1}$

$O((\Delta_{d-1}/\varepsilon)^{(d-1)/2})$. In this paper, we strengthen this by

significant utilization potential in statistical signal processing applications

hand, many signal recovery and optimization problems are formulated as
(possibly non-convex) quadratic programs with linear feasibility constraints in
the one-bit sampling regime. We demonstrate, with a particular focus on
quadratic compressed sensing, that the sample abundance paradigm allows for the
transformation of such quadratic problems to merely a linear feasibility
problem by forming a large-scale overdetermined linear system; thus removing
the need for costly optimization constraints and objectives. To efficiently
tackle the emerging overdetermined linear feasibility problem, we further
propose an enhanced randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, called Block SKM. Several

paper specifies such understandings starting with the zero-pole calculation of

clarifying the absolute reliability of determinant-based criterion with the

gas diffusion between neighboring domains into a statistically self-similar
scaling state, after the decay of initial transients, such that dimensionless
size and shape distributions become time independent and the average grows as a
power law. Partial integrodifferential equations for the time evolution of the
size distribution for such phase separating systems can be formulated for
arbitrary initial conditions, but these are cumbersome for analyzing data on
non-scaling state preparations. Here we show that essential features of the
approach to the scaling state can be captured by an exactly-solvable ordinary
differential equation for the evolution of the average bubble size. The key
ingredient is to characterize the the bubble size distribution approximately,
using the average size of all bubbles and the average size of the critical
bubbles, which instantaneously neither grow nor shrink. The difference between
these two averages serves as a proxy for the width of the size distribution. To
test our model, we compare with data for quasi-two dimensional dry foams
created with three different initial amounts of polydispersity. This allows us
to readily identify the critical radius from the average area of six-sided
bubbles, whose growth rate is zero by the von~Neumann law. The growth of the
average and critical radii agree quite well with exact solution, though the
most monodisperse sample crosses over to the scaling state faster than
expected. A simpler approximate solution of our model performs equally well.
Our approach is applicable to 3d foams, which we demonstrate by re-analyzing
prior data, as well as to froths of dilute droplets and to phase separation

assumptions and detecting outliers in statistical modelling. In the context of
survival models with censored observations, Li et al. (2021) introduced the
Z-residual, which follows an approximately normal distribution under the true
model. This property makes it possible to use Z-residuals for diagnosing
survival models in a way similar to how Pearson residuals are used in normal
regression. However, computing residuals based on the full dataset can result
in a conservative bias that reduces the power of detecting model
mis-specification, as the same dataset is used for both model fitting and
validation. Although cross-validation is a potential solution to this problem,
it has not been commonly used in residual diagnostics due to computational
challenges. In this paper, we propose a cross-validation approach for computing
Z-residuals in the context of shared frailty models. Specifically, we develop a
general function that calculates cross-validatory Z-residuals using the output
from the \texttt{coxph} function in the \texttt{survival} package in R.Our
simulation studies demonstrate that, for goodness-of-fit tests and outlier
detection, cross-validatory Z-residuals are significantly more powerful and
more discriminative than Z-residuals without cross-validation. We also compare
the performance of Z-residuals with and without cross-validation in identifying
outliers in a real application that models the recurrence time of kidney
infection patients. Our findings suggest that cross-validatory Z-residuals can
identify outliers that are missed by Z-residuals without cross-validation.

by Lotka-Volterra (LV) equations is mapped onto the Heisenberg-Weyl
non-commutative algebra, $[x,\,k] = i$, where the canonical variables $x$ and
$k$ are related to the two-dimensional LV parameters, $y = e^{-x}$ and $z =

patterns highly dependent on Gaussian localization. Besides exemplifying a

electrical, and optical switching between high spin (HS) and low spin (LS)
states, making them promising candidates for molecular spintronics. The LS and
HS transitions originate from the electronic configurations of Fe(II), and are
considered to be diamagnetic and paramagnetic respectively. The Fe(II) LS state
has six paired electrons in the ground states with no interaction with the
magnetic field and a diamagnetic behavior is usually observed. While the bulk
magnetic properties of Fe-triazole compounds are widely studied by standard
magnetometry techniques their properties at the individual level are missing.
Here we use nitrogen vacancy (NV) based magnetometry to study the magnetic
properties of the Fe-triazole LS state of nanoparticle clusters and individual
nanorods of size varying from 20 to 1000 nm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and Raman spectroscopy are performed to determine the size of the
nanoparticles/nanorods and to confirm their respective spin state. The magnetic
field patterns produced by the nanoparticles/nanorods are imaged by NV magnetic
microscopy as a function of applied magnetic field (up to 350 mT) and
correlated with SEM and Raman. We found that in most of the nanorods the LS
state is slightly paramagnetic, possibly originating from the surface oxidation
and/or the greater Fe(III) presence along the nanorod edges. NV measurements on
the Fe-triazole LS state nanoparticle clusters revealed both diamagnetic and
paramagnetic behavior. Our results highlight the potential of NV quantum
sensors to study the magnetic properties of spin crossover molecules and
molecular magnets.

keV diffuse emission found in the central part of the nearby starburst galaxy
M82 on a few arcsecond scales. The new details that we see allow a number of
important conclusions to be drawn on the nature of the hot gas and its origin
as well as feedback on the ISM. We use archival data from Chandra with an
exposure time of 570 ks. The Fexxv emission at 6.7 keV, expected from
metal-enriched hot gas, is enhanced only in a limited area close to the
starburst disc and is weak or almost absent over the rest of the diffuse
emission, resulting in spatial variations in EW from <0.1 keV to 1.9 keV. This
shows the presence of non-thermal emission due to inverse Compton scattering of
the FIR photons by radio emitting cosmic ray electrons. The morphological
resemblance between the diffuse X-ray, radio, and FIR emission maps supports
this concept. Our decomposition of the diffuse emission spectrum indicates that
~70% of the 4-8 keV luminosity originates from the inverse Compton emission.
The metal-rich hot gas with kT~5 keV makes a minor contribution to the 4-8 keV
continuum, but it accounts for the majority of the observed Fexxv line. This
hot gas appears to emerge from the circumnuclear starburst ring and fill the
galactic chimneys identified as mid-infrared and radio emission voids. The
energetics argument suggests that much of the supernova energy in the starburst
site has gone into creating the chimneys and is transported to the halo. We
argue that a hot, rarefied environment produced by strong supernova feedback
results in displacing the brightest X-ray and radio supernova remnants which
are instead found to reside in GMC. We find a faint X-ray source with a radio
counterpart, close to the kinematic centre of the galaxy and we carefully
examine the possibility that this source is a low-luminosity AGN in ADAF phase.

the fidelity of rPPG signals simultaneously obtained from multiple regions of a

Additionally, we performed experiments on pulse transit time (PTT) from both
the contact PPG and rPPG signals. We found that remote PTT is possible with
moderately high frame rate video when distal locations on the body are visible.
These findings and the supporting dataset should facilitate new research on
non-face rPPG and monitoring blood flow dynamics over the whole body with a

which limits further deployment on computational-constrained platforms. In this
work, we investigate the potential of network pruning for super-resolution to
take advantage of off-the-shelf network designs and reduce the underlying
computational overhead. Two main challenges remain in applying pruning methods
for SR. First, the widely-used filter pruning technique reflects limited
granularity and restricted adaptability to diverse network structures. Second,
existing pruning methods generally operate upon a pre-trained network for the
sparse structure determination, failing to get rid of dense model training in
the traditional SR paradigm. To address these challenges, we adopt unstructured
pruning with sparse models directly trained from scratch. Specifically, we
propose a novel Iterative Soft Shrinkage-Percentage (ISS-P) method by
optimizing the sparse structure of a randomly initialized network at each
iteration and tweaking unimportant weights with a small amount proportional to
the magnitude scale on-the-fly. We observe that the proposed ISS-P could
dynamically learn sparse structures adapting to the optimization process and
preserve the sparse model's trainability by yielding a more regularized
gradient throughput. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the

studying the outgassing of silicate material has demonstrated that such
atmosphere-interior interactions can affect the atmosphere's overall structure
and extent. But these models only considered SiO in an atmosphere of hydrogen
gas, without considering chemical reactions between them. Here we couple
calculations of the chemical equilibrium between H, Si, and O species with an
atmospheric structure model. We find that substantial amounts of silane,
SiH$_4$, and water, H$_2$O, are produced by the interaction between the
silicate-rich interior and hydrogen-rich atmosphere. These species extend high
into the atmosphere, though their abundance is greatest at the hottest, deepest
regions. For example, for a 4 $M_\oplus$ planet with an equilibrium temperature
of 1000 K, a base temperature of 5000 K, and a 0.1 $M_\oplus$ hydrogen
envelope, silicon species and water can comprise 30 percent of the atmosphere
by number at the bottom of the atmosphere. Due to this abundance enhancement,
we find that convection is inhibited at temperatures $\gtrsim 2500$ K. This
temperature is lower, implying that the resultant non-convective region is
thicker, than was found in previous models which did not account for
atmospheric chemistry. Our findings show that significant endogenous water is
be produced by magma-hydrogen interactions alone, without the need to accrete
ice-rich material. We discuss the observability of the signatures of
atmosphere-interior interaction and directions for future work, including
condensate lofting and more complex chemical networks.

suited for regular computations (e.g., linear algebra). Recent GPUs feature new
Ray Tracing (RT) cores that instead speed up the irregular process of ray
tracing using Bounding Volume Hierarchies. While these cores seem limited in
functionality, they can be used to accelerate n-body problems by leveraging RT
cores to accelerate the required distance computations. In this work, we
propose RT-DBSCAN, the first RT-accelerated DBSCAN implementation. We use RT
cores to accelerate Density-Based Clustering of Applications with Noise

samples and their target classes. However, researchers have increasingly
observed that machine learning practice easily leads to systematic errors in AI
applications, a phenomenon referred to as AI blindspots. Such blindspots arise
when a model is trained with training samples (e.g., cat/dog classification)
where important patterns (e.g., black cats) are missing or
periphery/undesirable patterns (e.g., dogs with grass background) are
misleading towards a certain class. Even more sophisticated techniques cannot
guarantee to capture, reason about, and prevent the spurious associations. In
this work, we propose ESCAPE, a visual analytic system that promotes a
human-in-the-loop workflow for countering systematic errors. By allowing human
users to easily inspect spurious associations, the system facilitates users to
spontaneously recognize concepts associated misclassifications and evaluate
mitigation strategies that can reduce biased associations. We also propose two
statistical approaches, relative concept association to better quantify the
associations between a concept and instances, and debias method to mitigate
spurious associations. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed ESCAPE system
and statistical measures through extensive evaluation including quantitative
experiments, usage scenarios, expert interviews, and controlled user

technology is one of the pathways making contributions to decarbonization, and
its energy management requires multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)
control. At the present, the existing methods usually decouple the MIMO control
into single-output (MISO) control and can only achieve its local optimal
performance. To optimize the multi-mode vehicle globally, this paper studies a
MIMO control method for energy management of the multi-mode PHEV based on
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). By introducing a relevance
ratio, a hand-shaking strategy is proposed to enable two learning agents to
work collaboratively under the MADRL framework using the deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Unified settings for the DDPG agents are
obtained through a sensitivity analysis of the influencing factors to the
learning performance. The optimal working mode for the hand-shaking strategy is
attained through a parametric study on the relevance ratio. The advantage of
the proposed energy management method is demonstrated on a software-in-the-loop
testing platform. The result of the study indiates that learning rate of the
DDPG agents is the greatest factor in learning performance. Using the unified
DDPG settings and a relevance ratio of 0.2, the proposed MADRL method can save
up to 4% energy compared to the single-agent method.

completely distinct from the standard equilibrium ground-state Mott insulator

the steady-state dissipative Mott phase is far more fragile than its ground

can result in visually unrealistic samples. To overcome these limitations,
recent works have explored the use of generative models as learnable data
augmentation tools, showing promising results in narrow application domains,
e.g., few-shot learning and low-data medical imaging. In this paper, we
introduce a data augmentation module, called DA_IC-GAN, which leverages
instance-conditioned GAN generations and can be used off-the-shelf in
conjunction with most state-of-the-art training recipes. We showcase the
benefits of DA_IC-GAN by plugging it out-of-the-box into the supervised
training of ResNets and DeiT models on the ImageNet dataset, and achieving
accuracy boosts up to between 1%p and 2%p with the highest capacity models.
Moreover, the learnt representations are shown to be more robust than the
baselines when transferred to a handful of out-of-distribution datasets, and
exhibit increased invariance to variations of instance and viewpoints. We
additionally couple DA_IC-GAN with a self-supervised training recipe and show
that we can also achieve an improvement of 1%p in accuracy in some settings.
With this work, we strengthen the evidence on the potential of learnable data
augmentations to improve visual representation learning, paving the road
towards non-handcrafted augmentations in model training.

capturing motion dynamics, presents new potential for 3D human pose tracking,
or video-based 3D human pose estimation. However, existing works in pose
tracking either require the presence of additional gray-scale images to
establish a solid starting pose, or ignore the temporal dependencies all
together by collapsing segments of event streams to form static event frames.
Meanwhile, although the effectiveness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs,
a.k.a. dense deep learning) has been showcased in many event-based tasks, the
use of ANNs tends to neglect the fact that compared to the dense frame-based
image sequences, the occurrence of events from an event camera is
spatiotemporally much sparser. Motivated by the above mentioned issues, we
present in this paper a dedicated end-to-end sparse deep learning approach for
event-based pose tracking: 1) to our knowledge this is the first time that 3D
human pose tracking is obtained from events only, thus eliminating the need of
accessing to any frame-based images as part of input; 2) our approach is based
entirely upon the framework of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which consists
of Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet and a novel Spiking Spatiotemporal
Transformer; 3) a large-scale synthetic dataset is constructed that features a
broad and diverse set of annotated 3D human motions, as well as longer hours of
event stream data, named SynEventHPD. Empirical experiments demonstrate that,
with superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ANNs counterparts,
our approach also achieves a significant computation reduction of 80% in FLOPS.
Furthermore, our proposed method also outperforms SOTA SNNs in the regression

paper, probabilistic relations, takes a step into our vision to tackle these
challenges.
  Our work in essence is based on Hehner's predicative probabilistic
programming, but there are several obstacles to the wider adoption of his work.
Our contributions here include (1) the formalisation of its syntax and
semantics by introducing an Iverson bracket notation to separate relations from
arithmetic; (2) the formalisation of relations using Unifying Theories of

the topological space of the real numbers; (3) the constructive semantics for
probabilistic loops using the Kleene's fixed point theorem; (4) the enrichment
of its semantics from distributions to subdistributions and superdistributions
in order to deal with the constructive semantics; (5) the unique fixed point
theorem to largely simplify the reasoning about probabilistic loops; and (6)
the mechanisation of our theory in Isabelle/UTP, an implementation of UTP in
Isabelle/HOL, for automated reasoning using theorem proving.

segments, each of which is an independent two-terminal device that can apply a
constant or ramped phase shift to a portion of the electron beam. We show the
improvement in image resolution using an electrostatic corrector. Engineering
criteria impose that much of the beam within the probe-forming aperture be
blocked by support bars, leading to large probe tails for the corrected probe

channels with state. The achievable rates are compared to capacity and capacity
bounds, showing that coding for the BSC with state over the VBC achieves rates
close to capacity at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), whereas
simpler schemes achieve lower rates at lower complexity. The presented coding
schemes are realizable using capacity-achieving codes for binary-input
channels, such as polar codes. Numerical results are provided to validate the
theoretical results and demonstrate the applicability of the proposed schemes.

altmetrics. The main objective of this study is to analyse whether the
altmetric mentions of COVID-19 medical studies are associated with the type of
study and its level of evidence. Data were collected from PubMed and
Altmetric.com databases. A total of 16,672 study types (e.g., Case reports or
Clinical trials) published in the year 2021 and with at least one altmetric
mention were retrieved. The altmetric indicators considered were Altmetric
Attention Score (AAS), News mentions, Twitter mentions, and Mendeley readers.
Once the dataset had been created, the first step was to carry out a
descriptive study. Then a normality hypothesis was contrasted by means of the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and since it was significant in all cases, the overall
comparison of groups was performed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis
test. When this test rejected the null hypothesis, pair-by-pair comparisons
were performed with the Mann-Whitney U test, and the intensity of the possible
association was measured using Cramers V coefficient. The results suggest that
the data do not fit a normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney U test revealed
coincidences in five groups of study types, the altmetric indicator with most
coincidences being news mentions and the study types with the most coincidences
were the systematic reviews together with the meta-analyses, which coincided
with four altmetric indicators. Likewise, between the study types and the
altmetric indicators, a weak but significant association was observed through
the chi-square and Cramers V. It is concluded that the positive association
between altmetrics and study types in medicine could reflect the level of the
pyramid of scientific evidence.

therefore there is a call for improvement within the nuclear data community.
This can be realized by automating/standardizing viable parts of the process,
namely, parameter estimation by fitting theoretical models to experimental
data. There are numerous candidate methods to approach this type of problem,
but many rely on large, labelled datasets that are not accessible to the
nuclear data evaluator. This work leverages problem-specific physics, Monte
Carlo sampling, and a general methodology for data synthesis to generate
unlimited, labelled experimental cross-section data of high-utility. The
synthesized data is said to be of high-utility because it is statistically
similar to the observed data. Heuristic and, where applicable, rigorous
statistical comparisons to observed data support this claim. An open-source
software is published alongside this article that executes the complete
methodology to produce high-utility synthetic datasets. The goal of this work
is to provide an approach and corresponding tool that will allow the evaluation

evaluate, and so far they have been studied in limited settings. Observational
studies are restricted in the kinds of causal questions they can answer and
naive A/B tests often lead to biased evaluations due to unaccounted network
interference. Furthermore, evaluations in simulation settings are often limited
to static network models that do not take into account the potential feedback
loops between link recommendation and organic network evolution. To this end,
we study the impacts of recommendations on social networks in dynamic settings.
Adopting a simulation-based approach, we consider an explicit dynamic formation
model -- an extension of the celebrated Jackson-Rogers model -- and investigate
how link recommendations affect network evolution over time. Empirically, we
find that link recommendations have surprising delayed and indirect effects on
the structural properties of networks. Specifically, we find that link
recommendations can exhibit considerably different impacts in the immediate
term and in the long term. For instance, we observe that friend-of-friend
recommendations can have an immediate effect in decreasing degree inequality,
but in the long term, they can make the degree distribution substantially more
unequal. Moreover, we show that the effects of recommendations can persist in
networks, in part due to their indirect impacts on natural dynamics even after
recommendations are turned off. We show that, in counterfactual simulations,
removing the indirect effects of link recommendations can make the network
trend faster toward what it would have been under natural growth dynamics.

homogeneous events, which can include fraudulent activities, network
infiltrations, equipment malfunctions, process changes, or other significant
but infrequent events. Prompt detection of such events can prevent potential
losses in terms of finances, information, and human resources. With the
advancement of computational capabilities and the availability of large
datasets, anomaly detection has become a major area of research. Among these,
anomaly detection in time series has gained more attention recently due to the
added complexity imposed by the time dimension. This study presents a novel
framework for time series anomaly detection using a combination of
Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) architecture and Autoencoder.
The Bi-LSTM network, which comprises two unidirectional LSTM networks, can
analyze the time series data from both directions and thus effectively discover
the long-term dependencies hidden in the sequential data. Meanwhile, the
Autoencoder mechanism helps to establish the optimal threshold beyond which an
event can be classified as an anomaly. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework, it is applied to a real-world multivariate time series
dataset collected from a wind farm. The Bi-LSTM Autoencoder model achieved a
classification accuracy of 96.79% and outperformed more commonly used LSTM
Autoencoder models.

discretisations in order to negate the time step limitation of explicitly
resolving the fast acoustic and gravity waves. Solving the resulting system to
convergence using Newton's method is considered prohibitively expensive, and so
the non-linear solver is typically truncated to a fixed number of iterations,
using an approximate Jacobian matrix that is reassembled only once per time
step. Rather than simply using four iterations of a second order Crank-Nicolson
time discretisation, the present article studies the impact of using various
third-order, four stage Rosenbrock-Wanner schemes, where instead of a simple
time centreing, the integration weights are chosen to meet specific stability
and order conditions. Rosenbrock-Wanner schemes present a promising alternative
on account of their ability to preserve their temporal order with only an
approximate Jacobian, and may be constructed to be stiffly-stable, a desirable
property in the presence of fast wave dynamics across multiple scales. These
schemes are compared to four iterations of a Crank-Nicolson scheme for the
solution of the 2D rotating shallow water equations and the 3D compressible
Euler equations at both planetary and non-hydrostatic scales and are shown to
exhibit improved results in terms of their energetic profiles and stability.

the premise that acceleration will correlate with astrometric uncertainties.
Catalog membership is based on whether constant proper motion over three

suggest that catalog members each have a 68% likelihood of true astrometric
acceleration; subsets of the catalog perform even better, with the likelihood
exceeding 85%. We compare the GNASC with Gaia Data Release 3 and its table of

based on their X-ray temporal and spectral properties, as well as multi-band

faint and non-magnetic CVs, the 11 CVs together define an orbital period
distribution significantly different from that of the CVs previously found in
the solar neighborhood and the Galactic bulge. In particular, there exists in
47 Tuc an apparent paucity of short-period CVs below the period gap, which
might be attributed to a high occupation fraction of non-magnetic CVs. Also
characteristic of the 47 Tuc CVs are an overabundance of long-period CVs with a
subgiant donor, a substantial fraction of CVs within the period gap, and a
steep radial surface density profile. These are best understood as a group of
CVs having recently formed via dynamical interactions in the dense cluster

  Conference, March 4-5 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Understanding player shooting profiles is an essential part of basketball
analysis: knowing where certain opposing players like to shoot from can help
coaches neutralize offensive gameplans from their opponents; understanding
where their players are most comfortable can lead them to developing more
effective offensive strategies. An automatic tool that can provide these
performance profiles in a timely manner can become invaluable for coaches to
maximize both the effectiveness of their game plan as well as the time
dedicated to practice and other related activities. Additionally, basketball is
dictated by many variables, such as playstyle and game dynamics, that can
change the flow of the game and, by extension, player performance profiles. It
is crucial that the performance profiles can reflect the diverse playstyles, as
well as the fast-changing dynamics of the game. We present a tool that can
visualize player performance profiles in a timely manner while taking into
account factors such as play-style and game dynamics. Our approach generates
interpretable heatmaps that allow us to identify and analyze how non-spatial
factors, such as game dynamics or playstyle, affect player performance
profiles.

  Markov Games","15 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.GT cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can be viewed as
having two phases that are iteratively implemented: a learning phase where the
model is approximately learned and a planning phase where the learned model is
used to derive a policy. In the case of standard MDPs, the learning problem can
be solved using either value iteration or policy iteration. However, in the
case of zero-sum Markov games, there is no efficient policy iteration
algorithm; e.g., it has been shown in Hansen et al. (2013) that one has to
solve Omega(1/(1-alpha)) MDPs, where alpha is the discount factor, to implement
the only known convergent version of policy iteration. Another algorithm for
Markov zero-sum games, called naive policy iteration, is easy to implement but
is only provably convergent under very restrictive assumptions. Prior attempts
to fix naive policy iteration algorithm have several limitations. Here, we show
that a simple variant of naive policy iteration for games converges, and
converges exponentially fast. The only addition we propose to naive policy
iteration is the use of lookahead in the policy improvement phase. This is
appealing because lookahead is anyway often used in RL for games. We further
show that lookahead can be implemented efficiently in linear Markov games,
which are the counterpart of the linear MDPs and have been the subject of much
attention recently. We then consider multi-agent reinforcement learning which
uses our algorithm in the planning phases, and provide sample and time
complexity bounds for such an algorithm.

time damped evolution equations in Hilbert spaces, subject to the constraint
that the solution lie within the unitary sphere. Then, we focus on a specific
example, the stochastic damped wave equation in a bounded domain of a
$d$-dimensional Euclidean space, endowed with the Dirichlet boundary condition,
with the added constraint that the $L^2$-norm of the solution is equal to one.
We introduce a small mass $\mu>0$ in front of the second-order derivative in
time and examine the validity of a Smoluchowski-Kramers diffusion
approximation. We demonstrate that, in the small mass limit, the solution
converges to the solution of a stochastic parabolic equation subject to the
same constraint. We further show that an extra noise-induced drift emerges,
which in fact does not account for the Stratonovich-to-It\^{o} correction term.

training neural dialog models, data augmentation is proposed to effectively
utilize existing training samples. However, current data augmentation
techniques on the dialog generation task mostly augment all cases in the
training dataset without considering the intrinsic attributes between different
cases. We argue that not all cases are beneficial for augmentation task, and
the cases suitable for augmentation should obey the following two attributes:
(1) low-quality (the dialog model cannot generate a high-quality response for
the case), (2) representative (the case should represent the property of the
whole dataset). Herein, we explore this idea by proposing a Selective Data
Augmentation framework (SDA) for the response generation task. SDA employs a
dual adversarial network to select the lowest quality and most representative
data points for augmentation in one stage. Extensive experiments conducted on
two publicly available datasets, i.e., DailyDialog and OpenSubtitles, show that
our framework can improve the response generation performance with respect to
various metrics.

it is time to move policy decisions away from individual servers altogether.
Built-in policies are complex and often exhibit bad performance at scale.
Meanwhile, the highly-controlled WSC setting presents opportunities to improve
performance and predictability.
  We propose moving all policy decisions from the OS kernel to the cluster
manager (CM), in a new paradigm we call Grape CM. In this design, the role of
the kernel is reduced to monitoring, sending metrics to the CM, and executing
policy decisions made by the CM. The CM uses metrics from all kernels across

clusters in the present day, are expected to host brightest cluster galaxies

billion years. These galaxies, BOSS1244-QG1 ($5.25\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$)
and BOSS1244-QG2 ($1.32\times 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$), were detected with Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) grism slitless spectroscopic observations. These two
quiescent galaxies are among the brightest member galaxies in BOSS1244 and
reside at redshifts $z=2.244$ and $z=2.242$, with a half-light radius of
$6.76\pm0.50$ and $2.72\pm0.16$ kiloparsec, respectively. BOSS1244-QG1 and

formation of a massive BCG, through a dry merger with size and mass similiar to
the most massive BCGs in the local Universe. We thus infer that BCG formation
have taken place before the virialization of the cluster core, which shatter
and broaden our previous understanding the BCGs in the mature galaxy clusters.
Moreover, we find for the first time in BOSS1244 a strong density-star
formation relation over a scale of 20 co-moving Mpc, implying that the
quenching of star formation in BCGs and their progenitors is likely governed by
environment-related processes before the virialization.

Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm being one of the most well-known. In this paper
we propose a new learning framework for neural networks, namely Cascaded
Forward (CaFo) algorithm, which does not rely on BP optimization as that in FF.
Unlike FF, our framework directly outputs label distributions at each cascaded
block, which does not require generation of additional negative samples and
thus leads to a more efficient process at both training and testing. Moreover,
in our framework each block can be trained independently, so it can be easily
deployed into parallel acceleration systems. The proposed method is evaluated
on four public image classification benchmarks, and the experimental results
illustrate significant improvement in prediction accuracy in comparison with
the baseline.

automatic design of vision transformers (ViT) exceeding 1G FLOPs. However,
designing lightweight and low-latency ViT models for diverse mobile devices
remains a big challenge. In this work, we propose ElasticViT, a two-stage NAS
approach that trains a high-quality ViT supernet over a very large search space
that supports a wide range of mobile devices, and then searches an optimal
sub-network (subnet) for direct deployment. However, prior supernet training
methods that rely on uniform sampling suffer from the gradient conflict issue:
the sampled subnets can have vastly different model sizes (e.g., 50M vs. 2G
FLOPs), leading to different optimization directions and inferior performance.
To address this challenge, we propose two novel sampling techniques:
complexity-aware sampling and performance-aware sampling. Complexity-aware
sampling limits the FLOPs difference among the subnets sampled across adjacent
training steps, while covering different-sized subnets in the search space.
Performance-aware sampling further selects subnets that have good accuracy,
which can reduce gradient conflicts and improve supernet quality. Our
discovered models, ElasticViT models, achieve top-1 accuracy from 67.2% to
80.0% on ImageNet from 60M to 800M FLOPs without extra retraining,
outperforming all prior CNNs and ViTs in terms of accuracy and latency. Our
tiny and small models are also the first ViT models that surpass
state-of-the-art CNNs with significantly lower latency on mobile devices. For
instance, ElasticViT-S1 runs 2.62x faster than EfficientNet-B0 with 0.1% higher

obstacles from LiDAR point clouds. However, recent works show the adversary can
forge non-existent cars in the prediction results with a few fake points (i.e.,
appearing attack). By removing statistical outliers, existing defenses are
however designed for specific attacks or biased by predefined heuristic rules.
Towards more comprehensive mitigation, we first systematically inspect the
mechanism of recent appearing attacks: Their common weaknesses are observed in
crafting fake obstacles which (i) have obvious differences in the local parts
compared with real obstacles and (ii) violate the physical relation between
depth and point density. In this paper, we propose a novel plug-and-play
defensive module which works by side of a trained LiDAR-based object detector
to eliminate forged obstacles where a major proportion of local parts have low
objectness, i.e., to what degree it belongs to a real object. At the core of
our module is a local objectness predictor, which explicitly incorporates the
depth information to model the relation between depth and point density, and
predicts each local part of an obstacle with an objectness score. Extensive
experiments show, our proposed defense eliminates at least 70% cars forged by
three known appearing attacks in most cases, while, for the best previous
defense, less than 30% forged cars are eliminated. Meanwhile, under the same
circumstance, our defense incurs less overhead for AP/precision on cars
compared with existing defenses. Furthermore, We validate the effectiveness of
our proposed defense on simulation-based closed-loop control driving tests in
the open-source system of Baidu's Apollo.

alternative to traditional plurality voting. Advocates of IRV claim that one of
its benefits relative to plurality voting is its tendency toward moderation:
that it produces more moderate winners than plurality and could therefore be a
useful tool for addressing polarization. However, there is little theoretical
backing for this claim, and existing evidence has focused on simulations and
case studies. In this work, we prove that IRV has a moderating effect relative
to traditional plurality voting in a specific sense, developed in a
1-dimensional Euclidean model of voter preferences. Our results show that as
long as voters are symmetrically distributed and not too concentrated at the
extremes, IRV will not elect a candidate that is beyond a certain threshold in
the tails of the distribution, while plurality can. For the uniform
distribution, we provide an approach for deriving the exact distributions of
the plurality and IRV winner positions, enabling further analysis. We also
extend a classical analysis of so-called stick-breaking processes to derive the
asymptotic winning plurality vote share, which we use to prove that plurality
can elect arbitrarily extreme candidates even when there are many moderate
options.

pruning methods in terms of realistic acceleration and hardware compatibility,
pruning methods with a finer granularity, such as intra-channel pruning, are
expected to be capable of yielding more compact and computationally efficient
networks. Typical intra-channel pruning methods utilize a static and
hand-crafted pruning granularity due to a large search space, which leaves room
for improvement in their pruning performance. In this work, we introduce a
novel structure pruning method, termed as dynamic structure pruning, to

to existing intra-channel pruning methods, the proposed method automatically
optimizes dynamic pruning granularities in each layer while training deep

In this paper, we propose a zero-norm regularized smooth difference of

Numerical comparisons with several state-of-art methods show that in terms of

about their future behavior. Occlusions, which often occur in robot operating
scenarios, make the decision-making of robots even more challenging. In
scenarios without occlusions, dynamic game theory provides a solid theoretical

However, an apparent shortcoming is that it does not account for agents that

predict the agents' future behavior based on the recovered game model. We
demonstrate our method in several simulated scenarios. Results reveal that our

history and a rich literature. The standard Hamiltonian function that describes
the dynamics of interacting point vortices of constant strength is the
Kirchhoff-Routh (KR) function. This function was not obtained from basic
definitions of classical mechanics (i.e., in terms of kinetic and potential
energies), but it was rather devised to match the already known differential
equations of motion for constant-strength point vortices given by the
Bio-Savart law. Instead, we develop a new variational formulation for vortex
dynamics based on the principle of least action. As an application, we consider
a system of non-deforming, free vortex patches of constant-strength.
Interestingly, the obtained equations of motion are second-order differential
equations defining vortex accelerations, not velocities. In the special case of
constant-strength point vortices, the new formulation reduces to the motion
determined from the KR function. However, for finite-core vortices, the
resulting dynamics are more complex than those obtained from the KR
formulation. For example, a pair of equal-strength, counter-rotating vortices
could be initialized with different velocities, resulting in interesting
patterns which cannot be handled by the KR approach. Also, the developed model
easily admits external body forces (e.g., electromagnetic). The interaction
between the electrodynamic force and the hydrodynamic vortex force leads to a
rich, counter-intuitive behavior that could not be handled by the KR
formulation. Finally, this new variational formulation, which is derived from
first principles in mechanics, can be easily extended to deforming and/or

vision-based continuous sensing systems that use large-pixel-count imaging are
generally bottlenecked due to their digital storage, data transmission and
image processing requirements. Here, we report a diffractive processor that
rapidly detects hidden defects/objects within a target sample using a
single-pixel spectroscopic terahertz detector, without scanning the sample or
forming/processing its image. This terahertz processor consists of passive
diffractive layers that are optimized using deep learning to modify the

analyzing the detection sensitivity as a function of the size and position of
the unknown defects. We validated its feasibility using a single-pixel

effects given observational data with high or even ultra-high dimensional
pretreatment variables. Existing methods for this problem typically assume
sparse linear models for both outcome and univariate treatment, and cannot
handle situations with ultra-high dimensional covariates. In this paper, we
propose a new covariate selection strategy called double screening prior
adaptive lasso (DSPAL) to select confounders and predictors of the outcome for
multivariate treatments, which combines the adaptive lasso method with the
marginal conditional (in)dependence prior information to select target
covariates, in order to eliminate confounding bias and improve statistical
efficiency. The distinctive features of our proposal are that it can be applied
to high-dimensional or even ultra-high dimensional covariates for multivariate
treatments, and can deal with the cases of both parametric and nonparametric
outcome models, which makes it more robust compared to other methods. Our
theoretical analyses show that the proposed procedure enjoys the sure screening
property, the ranking consistency property and the variable selection
consistency. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed
approach selects all confounders and predictors consistently and estimates the
multivariate treatment effects with smaller bias and mean squared error
compared to several alternatives under various scenarios. In real data
analysis, the method is applied to estimate the causal effect of a
three-dimensional continuous environmental treatment on cholesterol level and
enlightening results are obtained.

function of the state in which the process is currently in. The state itself is
determined by the subset of infected agents at the beginning of that epoch, and
the most recent action profile of all the agents. Our main results are
concerned with the limiting distributions of both the cardinality of the subset
of infected agents and the action profile as time approaches infinity,

can fully exploit the hidden physical information in the coded apertures via
explicit $\mathcal{R}$$-$$\mathcal{N}$ decomposition and explore the

validated to surpass other state-of-the-art methods on both multiple- and

size on disk) in a consistent way for different types of updates (full vs.

MV updates as independent SQL statements without fully exploiting their
dependency information and performance metrics. However, if we know that the
result of a SQL statement will be consumed immediately after for subsequent
operations, those subsequent operations do not have to wait until the early
results are fully materialized on storage because the results are already
readily available in memory. Of course, this may come at a cost because keeping
results in memory (even temporarily) will reduce the amount of available
memory; thus, our decision should be careful. In this paper, we introduce a new
system, called S/C, which tackles this problem through efficient creation and
update of a set of MVs with acyclic dependencies among them. S/C judiciously
uses bounded memory to reduce end-to-end MV refresh time by short-circuiting
expensive reads and writes; S/C's objective function accurately estimates time
savings from keeping intermediate data in memory for particular periods. Our
solution jointly optimizes an MV refresh order, what data to keep in memory,
and when to release data from memory. At a high level, S/C still materializes
all data exactly as defined in MV definitions; thus, it doesn't impact any
service-level agreements. In our experiments with TPC-DS datasets (up to 1TB),
we show S/C's optimization can speedup end-to-end runtime by 1.04x-5.08x with

of the outflow rate. We apply the model to a sample of well-observed FBOTs.
FBOTs require high outflow rates ($\sim 30$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) and fast
velocity ($\sim 0.2-0.3c$), with the typical ejecta mass and energy budget of
$\sim 0.2$ M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim 10^{52}$ erg, respectively. The energetic
outflow supports the idea that the central engine of FBOTs may be related to a
relativistic object, e.g., a black hole. The initial photospheric temperature
is $10^{5-6}$ K, which suggests that FBOTs will show UV or X-ray flash similar

at higher levels in the visual hierarchy. Specifically, we develop this theory
for a generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields, which
is derived in an axiomatic manner from first principles, that reflect symmetry
properties of the environment, complemented by structural assumptions to
guarantee internally consistent treatment of image structures over multiple
spatio-temporal scales.
  It is shown how the studied generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual
receptive fields obeys true covariance properties under spatial scaling
transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and
temporal scaling transformations, implying that a vision system, based on image
and video measurements in terms of the receptive fields according to this
model, can to first order of approximation handle the image and video
deformations between multiple views of objects delimited by smooth surfaces, as
well as between multiple views of spatio-temporal events, under varying
relative motions between the objects and events in the world and the observer.
  We conclude by describing implications of the presented theory for biological
vision, regarding connections between the variabilities of the shapes of

inclusion, diversity, and equality in their design can create barriers (e.g.,
excluding some of the users because of their gender) for their diverse users.
While there have been some efforts to develop gender-inclusive apps, a lack of
deep understanding regarding user perspectives on gender may prevent app
developers and owners from identifying issues related to gender and proposing
solutions for improvement. Users express many different opinions about apps in
their reviews, from sharing their experiences, and reporting bugs, to
requesting new features. In this study, we aim at unpacking gender discussions
about apps from the user perspective by analysing app reviews. We first develop
and evaluate several Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) classifiers
that automatically detect gender reviews (i.e., reviews that contain
discussions about gender). We apply our ML and DL classifiers on a manually
constructed dataset of 1,440 app reviews from the Google App Store, composing
620 gender reviews and 820 non-gender reviews. Our best classifier achieves an
F1-score of 90.77%. Second, our qualitative analysis of a randomly selected 388
out of 620 gender reviews shows that gender discussions in app reviews revolve
around six topics: App Features, Appearance, Content, Company Policy and
Censorship, Advertisement, and Community. Finally, we provide some practical
implications and recommendations for developing gender-inclusive apps.

systematically investigate both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to the
anomalous Hall effect (AHE), anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), and anomalous
thermal Hall effect (ATHE) in two Heusler ferromagnets: Fe$_2$CoAl and
Fe$_2$NiAl. Our analysis reveals that the extrinsic mechanism originating from
disorder dominates the AHE and ATHE in Fe$_2$CoAl , primarily due to the steep
band dispersions across the Fermi energy and corresponding high longitudinal
electronic conductivity. Conversely, the intrinsic Berry phase mechanism,
physically linked to nearly flat bands around the Fermi energy and gapped by
spin-orbit interaction band crossings, governs the AHE and ATHE in Fe$_2$NiAl.
With respect to ANE, both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are competing in
Fe$_2$CoAl as well as in Fe$_2$NiAl. Furthermore, Fe$_2$CoAl and Fe$_2$NiAl
exhibit tunable and remarkably pronounced anomalous transport properties. For
instance, the anomalous Nernst and anomalous thermal Hall conductivities in
Fe$_2$NiAl attain giant values of 8.29 A/Km and 1.19 W/Km, respectively, at
room temperature. To provide a useful comparison, we also thoroughly
investigated the anomalous transport properties of Co$_2$MnGa. Our findings

becomes increasingly pronounced, enabling a large variety of possible polar
textures in nanocrystalline and nanocomposite materials. Critical to the
understanding of fundamental physics of such materials and hence their
applications in electronic nanodevices, is the ability to investigate their
ferroelectric polarization at the nanoscale in a non-destructive way. We show
that contact Kelvin probe force microscopy (cKPFM) combined with a k-means
response clustering algorithm enables to measure the ferroelectric response at
a mapping resolution of 8 nm. In a BaTiO3 thin film on silicon composed of
tetragonal and hexagonal nanocrystals, we determine a nanoscale lateral
distribution of discrete ferroelectric response clusters, fully consistent with
the nanostructure determined by transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, we
apply this data clustering method to the cKPFM responses measured at different
temperatures, which allows us to follow the corresponding change in
polarization pattern as the Curie temperature is approached and across the
phase transition. This work opens up perspectives for mapping complex
ferroelectric polarization textures such as curled/swirled polar textures that
can be stabilized in epitaxial heterostructures and more generally mapping the

proposes an automatic checkerboard-based approach to calibrate extrinsics

presented. Firstly, we present an automatic feature extraction and checkerboard
tracking method from LiDAR's point clouds. Secondly, we reconstruct realistic
frame images from event streams, applying traditional corner detectors to event
cameras. Thirdly, we propose an initialization-refinement procedure to estimate
extrinsics using point-to-plane and point-to-line constraints in a
coarse-to-fine manner. Fourthly, we introduce a unified and globally optimal
solution to address two optimization problems in calibration. Our approach has
been validated with extensive experiments on 19 simulated and real-world
datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art.

introduces an additional remapping network, mapping a known continuous

experimentally demonstrate this capability through the observation of Rydberg
moir\'e excitons (XRM), which are moir\'e trapped Rydberg excitons in monolayer
semiconductor WSe2 adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene. In the strong coupling
regime, the XRM manifest as multiple energy splittings, pronounced redshift,
and narrowed linewidth in the reflectance spectra, highlighting their
charge-transfer character where electron-hole separation is enforced by the
strongly asymmetric interlayer Coulomb interactions. Our findings pave the way
for pursuing novel physics and quantum technology exploitation based on the
excitonic Rydberg states.

to the TeV band by using a sample of 58 TeV blazars including 48 blazars in the
quiescent state and 21 blazars in the flaring state. We investigate the
correlation between the TeV luminosity, which has been compensated for
attenuation from extragalactic background light, and the synchrotron peak
frequency. We note that there is no correlation between TeV luminosity and peak
frequency in the quiescent state and a strong anti-correlation in the flaring
state for the observed value. However, there is a strong positive correlation
in both the quiescent state and the flaring state for the intrinsic value. This
indicates that the blazar sequence is shown in the flaring state rather than in
the quiescent state for the observed value and the blazar sequence is not
present in both two states after removing the beaming effect. In addition, to
confirm whether the beaming effect results in the blazar sequence, we compare
the \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray luminosity between the quiescent state and the
flaring state. We find the \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray luminosity in the
flaring state is greater than that in the quiescent state and the Doppler
factor in the flaring state is greater. We suggest the blazar sequence in the
flaring state may be due to the stronger beaming effect.

relation between visual features and semantic attributes learned from the seen

leverages unlabeled unseen data during training and has obtained impressive
results. These methods always synthesize unseen features from attributes
through a generative adversarial network to mitigate the bias towards seen

learns the mapping from visual features to semantic attributes. Then, from the
attribute decoder, we obtain pseudo-attributes of unlabeled data and integrate
them into the generative model, which helps capture the detailed differences

the video as their joint probability p(candidates,query). This is accomplished
through a diffusion-based text-video retrieval framework (DiffusionRet), which
models the retrieval task as a process of gradually generating joint
distribution from noise. During training, DiffusionRet is optimized from both
the generation and discrimination perspectives, with the generator being
optimized by generation loss and the feature extractor trained with contrastive
loss. In this way, DiffusionRet cleverly leverages the strengths of both
generative and discriminative methods. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks, including MSRVTT, LSMDC, MSVD,

sensory systems and how they are adapted to the environment: early vision
evolved to maximise the information it conveys about incoming signals.
Following Shannon's definition, this information was described using the
probability of the images taken from natural scenes. Previously, direct
accurate predictions of image probabilities were not possible due to
computational limitations. Despite the exploration of this idea being indirect,
mainly based on oversimplified models of the image density or on system design
methods, these methods had success in reproducing a wide range of physiological
and psychophysical phenomena. In this paper, we directly evaluate the
probability of natural images and analyse how it may determine perceptual
sensitivity. We employ image quality metrics that correlate well with human
opinion as a surrogate of human vision, and an advanced generative model to
directly estimate the probability. Specifically, we analyse how the sensitivity
of full-reference image quality metrics can be predicted from quantities
derived directly from the probability distribution of natural images. First, we
compute the mutual information between a wide range of probability surrogates
and the sensitivity of the metrics and find that the most influential factor is
the probability of the noisy image. Then we explore how these probability
surrogates can be combined using a simple model to predict the metric
sensitivity, giving an upper bound for the correlation of 0.85 between the
model predictions and the actual perceptual sensitivity. Finally, we explore
how to combine the probability surrogates using simple expressions, and obtain
two functional forms (using one or two surrogates) that can be used to predict
the sensitivity of the human visual system given a particular pair of images.

clustering of galaxies in redshift space. Our main additions are: the
computation of the velocity field in the LPT gravity model, the fully nonlinear
displacement of the evolved, biased density field to redshift space, and a
systematic expansion of velocity bias. We test the resulting analysis pipeline
by applying it to synthetic data sets with a known ground truth at increasing
complexity: mock data generated from the perturbative forward model itself,
sub-sampled matter particles, and dark matter halos in N-body simulations. By
fixing the initial-time density contrast to the ground truth, while varying the
growth rate $f$, bias coefficients and noise amplitudes, we perform a stringent
set of checks. These show that indeed a systematic higher-order expansion of
the velocity bias is required to infer a growth rate consistent with the ground
truth within errors. Applied to dark matter halos, our analysis yields unbiased
constraints on $f$ at the level of a few percent for a variety of halo masses
at redshifts $z=0,\,0.5,\,1$ and for a broad range of cutoff scales
$0.08\,h/\mathrm{Mpc} \leq \Lambda \leq 0.20\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$. Importantly,
deviations between true and inferred growth rate exhibit the scaling with halo
mass, redshift and cutoff that one expects based on the EFT of Large Scale

in the dynamics of magnetized flows such as the interstellar medium (ISM). In
weakly ionised medium, their propagation critically depends on the ionisation
rate but also on the charge carriers which, depending on gas density can be
ions, electrons or dust grains. The latter in particular are well known to have
a drastic influence on the magnetic resistivities in the dense ISM such as
collapsing dense cores. Yet, in most calculations, for numerical reasons, the
grain inertia is usually neglected. We investigate analytically the propagation
of Alfv\'en waves both in a single-size and multi-size grain medium such as the
ISM and we obtain exact expressions giving wavenumbers as a function of wave
frequencies. These expressions are then solved analytically or numerically
taking into account or neglecting grain inertia. Whereas at large wavelengths,
neglecting grain inertia is a very good approximation, the situation is rather
different for wavelengths shorter than a critical value, which broadly scales
as $1/n$, $n$ being the gas density. More precisely, when inertia is neglected
the waves do not propagate at short wavelengths or, due to the Hall effect,
develop for one circular polarisation only, a whistler mode such that ${\cal R}
_e (\omega) \propto k^2$, whereas the other polarisation presents a zero group
velocity, i.e. ${\cal R} _e (\omega) \propto k^0$. When grain inertia is
accounted for, the propagation of the two polarisations tend to be more
symmetrical and the whistler mode is only present at density higher than
$\simeq 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. At lower density it is replaced by a mode having
${\cal R} _e (\omega) \propto k^{\simeq 1.2}$. Abridged

to hidden attractors in systems with stable equilibrium points and in systems

Real-time hardware experiments were performed to demonstrate the existence of
hidden attractors in these systems. Despite the difficulties in identifying the
suitable initial conditions from the appropriate basin of attraction, we
performed experiments to detect hidden attractors in nonlinear electronic

parameter, which quantifies the non-uniformity of the signal recorded in
detectors located at a given distance on a ring around the shower axis, has
been successfully introduced as a gamma/hadron discriminator at PeV energies
\cite{Conceicao:2022lkc}. In this work, we demonstrate that the $LCm$ parameter
can effectively serve as a mass composition discriminator in experiments that
employ a compact array of detectors, like KASCADE. We reconstruct the $LCm$
parameter distributions in the energy range $\lg(E/\rm eV) = [15.0 \text{ - }
16.0]$ using measurements from the KASCADE experiment, with intervals of
$\lg(E/\rm eV) = 0.1$, which are then fitted with MC templates for five primary
nuclei species p, He, C, Si, and Fe considering five hadronic interaction
models: QGSjet-II-02, QGSjet-II-04, EPOS-LHC, SIBYLL 2.3c and SIBYLL 2.3d. We
find that the $LCm$ parameter exhibits minimal dependence on the specific
hadronic interaction model considered. The reconstructed fractions of
individual species demonstrate a linear decrease in the abundance of protons
with increasing energy, while the heavier components become prevalent above the
\textit{knee} as predicted by all five hadronic interaction models. Our
findings indicate that the abundance of particle types as a function of energy
aligns with three astrophysical models that link the \textit{knee} to the
acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays within the Galaxy. These findings
suggest that the $LCm$ parameter could be a valuable tool for forthcoming
measurements of the LHAASO experiment to enhance our knowledge about the origin
and acceleration mechanisms of cosmic rays.

viscoelastic fluids while experiencing shear flow. FISA has many applications
across many fields including material science, food processing and the
biomedical field. Although this phenomena is currently not fully understood it
is accepted that the shear-thinning nature of the complex fluid plays a role in
enhancing FISA. In this work, a bespoke cone and plate shear cell is used to
provide new insights on the FISA dynamics. In particular, we have fine tuned
the applied shear rates to investigate the particle chaining phenomenon across
a Weissenberg number of 1, on a particle suspension made by a viscoelastic
fluid characterised by a clear transition between a Newtonian-like behaviour
(at relatively low shear rates) and a shear-thinning one (at relatively high
shear rates). This has allowed us to reveal phenomena never reported previously
in literature before; e.g., we have corroborated that for Weissenberg number
higher than 1, the shear thinning nature of the viscoelastic fluid strongly
enhances FISA and that particle chains break apart when a constant shear is
applied for sufficiently long-time (i.e. much longer than the fluids' longest
relaxation time). We speculate that this latter point could be explained by a
''disentanglement'' process of the polymer chains constituting the viscoelastic
fluid.

for the assessment of different types of dynamical stability. By comparing the
results on Erdos-Renyi and Husimi graphs with antagonistic or mixture

for stability not to be affected by system size, as traditionally implied by
the complexity-stability trade-off in conventional models of random matrices.
This criterion generally holds for all graphs with locally tree-like structures
and antagonistic or unidirectional interactions. In addition, for locally sign
stable graphs, we observe that the leading eigenvalue undergoes a transition
from being real to acquiring a nonnull imaginary part, which implies a
dynamical transition from nonoscillatory to oscillatory linear response to
perturbations. Lastly, we ascertain the discontinuous nature of this
transition.

planets. Often, these planets are found to orbit near to the zone of dynamical
instability, close to the central binary. The existence of these planets has
been explained by hydrodynamical simulations that show that migrating
circumbinary planets, embedded in circumbinary discs, halt at the central
cavity that is formed by the central binary. Transit surveys are naturally most
sensitive to finding circumbinary planets with the shortest orbital periods.
The future promise of detecting longer period systems using radial-velocity
searches, combined with the anticipated detection of numerous circumbinary
planets by ESA's PLATO mission, points to the need to model and understand the
formation and evolution of circumbinary planets in a more general sense than
has been considered before. With this goal in mind, we present a newly
developed global model of circumbinary planet formation that is based on the
mercury6 symplectic N-body integrator, combined with a model for the
circumbinary disc and prescriptions for a range of processes involved in planet
formation such as pebble accretion, gas envelope accretion and migration. Our
results show that under reasonable assumptions, the pebble accretion scenario
can produce circumbinary systems that are similar to those observed, and in
particular is able to produce planets akin to Kepler-16b and Kepler-34b.
Comparing our results to other systems, we find that our models also adequately
reproduce such systems, including multi-planet systems. Resonances between
neighbouring planets are frequently obtained, whilst ejections of planets by
the central binary acts as an effective source of free floating planets.

$M\simeq \mathrm{GL}_r\times\mathrm{Sp}_{2m}$ that defines the local factors,
the action of the maximal unipotent subgroup of $M$ on $N$ have non-trivial
stabilizers, and the space of integration for the corresponding local
coefficient is no longer isomorphic to a torus. We will separate its toric part
out in our cases and show that it plays the same role as the torus over which
the integral representing the local coefficient is taken in the known cases.

behaviour arising from Riemannian geometry. To test its feasibility, this
metric has been used to evaluate the performance of the most commonly used
dimension reduction algorithms in the state of the art. Furthermore, to make
the evaluation of the algorithms robust and representative, using curvature
properties of planar curves, a new parameterized problem instance generator has
been constructed in the form of a function generator. Experimental results are
consistent with what could be expected based on the design and characteristics
of the evaluated algorithms and the features of the data instances used to feed
the method.

coverage algorithms face two major challenges: (1) dealing with nonlinear

performing the task in an initially unknown environment. We solve the coverage
problem by using a hierarchical framework, where references are calculated at a
central server and passed to the agents' local model predictive control (MPC)
tracking schemes. Furthermore, a probabilistic exploration-exploitation
trade-off is deployed to ensure that the environment is actively explored by
the agents. In addition, we derive a control framework that avoids the
hierarchical structure by integrating the reference optimization in the MPC
formulation. Active learning is then performed drawing inspiration from Upper

convergence to an optimal configuration for all developed control
architectures. Furthermore, all methods are tested and compared on hardware
using a miniature car platform.

system for pedestrian tracking in smart environments using multiple distributed
LiDARs of non-overlapping views. The system is designed to leverage LiDAR
devices to track pedestrians in partially covered areas due to practical
constraints, e.g., occlusion or cost. Therefore, the system uses the point
cloud captured by different LiDARs to extract discriminative features that are
used to train a metric learning model for pedestrian matching purposes. To
boost the system's robustness, we leverage a probabilistic approach to model
and adapt the dynamic mobility patterns of individuals and thus connect their
sub-trajectories. We deployed the system in a large-scale testbed with 70
colorless LiDARs and conducted three different experiments. The evaluation
result at the entrance hall confirms the system's ability to accurately track
the pedestrians with a 0.98 F-measure even with zero-covered areas. This result

event cameras have microsecond-level latency and high dynamic range, hence
showing great potential for object detection under high-speed motion and poor
illumination conditions. Due to sparsity and asynchronism nature with event
streams, most of existing approaches resort to hand-crafted methods to convert
event data into 2D grid representation. However, they are sub-optimal in
aggregating information from event stream for object detection. In this work,
we propose to learn an event representation optimized for event-based object
detection. Specifically, event streams are divided into grids in the x-y-t
coordinates for both positive and negative polarity, producing a set of pillars
as 3D tensor representation. To fully exploit information with event streams to
detect objects, a dual-memory aggregation network (DMANet) is proposed to
leverage both long and short memory along event streams to aggregate effective
information for object detection. Long memory is encoded in the hidden state of
adaptive convLSTMs while short memory is modeled by computing spatial-temporal
correlation between event pillars at neighboring time intervals. Extensive
experiments on the recently released event-based automotive detection dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

  In Beaudoin (1998), Beaudoin and Beauchemin (2003), and Pepin et al. (2019),
a new method to compute spline approximations of low or high degree from

analyzed. The accuracy of this method greatly depends on the accuracy of the

Therefore, the dynamical entanglement of the Gaussian state in an expanding

is often violated in practical settings, particularly in medical images. The
presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in the unlabeled training pool of
semi-SL is inevitable and can reduce the efficiency of the algorithm. Common
preprocessing methods to filter out outlier samples may not be suitable for
medical images that involve a wide range of anatomical structures and rare
morphologies. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline for addressing
open-set supervised learning challenges in digital histology images. Our
pipeline efficiently estimates an OOD score for each unlabelled data point
based on self-supervised learning to calibrate the knowledge needed for a
subsequent semi-SL framework. The outlier score derived from the OOD detector
is used to modulate sample selection for the subsequent semi-SL stage, ensuring
that samples conforming to the distribution of the few labeled samples are more
frequently exposed to the subsequent semi-SL framework. Our framework is
compatible with any semi-SL framework, and we base our experiments on the
popular Mixmatch semi-SL framework. We conduct extensive studies on two digital

evolution of asexual, phenotypic trait-structured population, is studied. We
consider a large population with constant population size characterised by a

rate where mutations occur during life. In this model, the population state at
fixed time is given as a measure on the space of phenotypes and the evolution
of the population is described by a continuous time, measure-valued Markov
process. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the system, where mutations
are frequent, in the double simultaneous limit of large population $(K \to
+\infty)$ and small mutational effects $(\sigma \to 0)$ proving convergence to
an ODE known as the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. This result holds
only for a certain range of $\sigma$ parameters (as a function of $K$) which
must be small enough but not too small either. The canonical equation describes
the evolution in time of the dominant trait in the population driven by a
fitness gradient. This result is based on an slow-fast asymptotic analysis. We
use an averaging method, inspired by (Kurtz, 1992), which exploits a martingale
approach and compactness-uniqueness arguments. The contribution of the fast
component, which converges to the centered Fleming-Viot process, is obtained by
averaging according to its invariant measure, recently characterised in

not explicitly model the structural information among cells, which is a key
feature of pathology images and provides significant information for making
diagnoses. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework called
GNNFormer, which seamlessly integrates graph neural network (GNN) and
Transformer into the same framework, for cytopathology report generation. To
the best of our knowledge, GNNFormer is the first report generation method that
explicitly models the structural information among cells in pathology images.
It also effectively fuses structural information among cells, fine-grained
morphology features of cells and background features to generate high-quality
reports. Experimental results on the NMI-WSI dataset show that GNNFormer can
outperform other state-of-the-art baselines.

specific content elements is difficult because many, technically diverse tools

disciplines. We provide a large and diverse evaluation framework that supports
more extraction tasks than most related datasets. Our framework builds upon
DocBank, a multi-domain dataset of 1.5M annotated content elements extracted
from 500K pages of research papers on arXiv. Using the new framework, we
benchmark ten freely available tools in extracting document metadata,
bibliographic references, tables, and other content elements from academic PDF
documents. GROBID achieves the best metadata and reference extraction results,
followed by CERMINE and Science Parse. For table extraction, Adobe Extract
outperforms other tools, even though the performance is much lower than for
other content elements. All tools struggle to extract lists, footers, and
equations. We conclude that more research on improving and combining tools is
necessary to achieve satisfactory extraction quality for most content elements.
Evaluation datasets and frameworks like the one we present support this line of

realities, as they contain all cues for localizing sound sources in
three-dimensional space. Acoustic measurements are one way to obtain
high-quality HRTFs. To reduce measurement time, cost, and complexity of
measurement systems, a promising approach is to capture only a few HRTFs on a
sparse sampling grid and then upsample them to a dense HRTF set by
interpolation. However, HRTF interpolation is challenging because small changes
in source position can result in significant changes in the HRTF phase and
magnitude response. Previous studies greatly improved the interpolation by
time-aligning the HRTFs in preprocessing, but magnitude interpolation errors,
especially in contralateral regions, remain a problem. Building upon the
time-alignment approaches, we propose an additional post-interpolation
magnitude correction derived from a frequency-smoothed HRTF representation.
Employing all 96 individual simulated HRTF sets of the HUTUBS database, we show
that the magnitude correction significantly reduces interpolation errors
compared to state-of-the-art interpolation methods applying only time
alignment. Our analysis shows that when upsampling very sparse HRTF sets, the
subject-averaged magnitude error in the critical higher frequency range is up
to 1.5 dB lower when averaged over all directions and even up to 4 dB lower in
the contralateral region. As a result, the interaural level differences in the
upsampled HRTFs are considerably improved. The proposed algorithm thus has the
potential to further reduce the minimum number of HRTFs required for
perceptually transparent interpolation.

macroscopic Kohn-Sham (KS) density response function connecting an average over

developed workflow is demonstrated for the example of warm dense hydrogen. We
show that a naive direct arithmetic averaging of the KS response functions or
of the dynamic dielectric functions computed for individual snapshots leads to
uncontrolled errors that are particularly pronounced in the limit of small wave

depth values suffer from 1) incomplete volumetric predictions and 2) confused
semantic labels. To this end, we use the ground-truth 3D voxels to generate a
perfect visible surface, called TSDF-CAD, and then train a ""cleaner"" SSC model.
As the model is noise-free, it is expected to focus more on the ""imagination""
of unseen voxels. Then, we propose to distill the intermediate ""cleaner""
knowledge into another model with noisy TSDF input. In particular, we use the
3D occupancy feature and the semantic relations of the ""cleaner self"" to
supervise the counterparts of the ""noisy self"" to respectively address the
above two incorrect predictions. Experimental results validate that our method
improves the noisy counterparts with 3.1% IoU and 2.2% mIoU for measuring scene
completion and SSC, and also achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy on the
popular NYU dataset.

deviations of around 70 meV for $G_0W_0$@PBE and $G_0W_0$@PBE0. These are most
likely due to technical differences in both implementations, most notably the
use of different basis sets, pseudopotential approximations, different
treatment of the frequency dependency of the self-energy and the choice of the
2C-Hamiltonian. Finally, we assess the performance of some (partially
self-consistent) variants of the GWA for the calculation of first IPs by
comparison to vertical experimental reference values. $G_0W_0$PBE0 (25 \% exact

strongly influenced by their mass loss through a stellar wind. This is believed
to be caused by radiation pressure due to the absorption and scattering of the
stellar radiation by the dust grains formed in the atmosphere. The optical
properties of dust are often estimated using the small particle limit (SPL)
approximation, and it has been used frequently in modelling AGB stellar winds
when performing radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations. We aim to
investigate the effects of replacing the SPL approximation by detailed Mie
calculations of the size-dependent opacities for grains of amorphous carbon
forming in C-rich AGB star atmospheres. We performed RHD simulations for a
large grid of carbon star atmosphere+wind models with different effective
temperatures, luminosities, stellar masses, carbon excesses, and pulsation
properties. Also, a posteriori radiative transfer calculations for many radial
structures (snapshots) of these models were done, resulting in spectra and
filter magnitudes. We find, when giving up the SPL approximation, the wind
models become more strongly variable and more dominated by gusts, although the
average mass-loss rates and outflow speeds do not change significantly; the
increased radiative pressure on the dust throughout its formation zone does,
however, result in smaller grains and lower condensation fractions (and thus
higher gas-to-dust ratios). The photometric K magnitudes are generally
brighter, but at V the effects of using size-dependent dust opacities are more
complex: brighter for low mass-loss rates and dimmer for massive stellar winds.
Given the large effects on spectra and photometric properties, it is necessary
to use the detailed dust optical data instead of the simple SPL approximation
in stellar atmosphere+wind modelling where dust is formed.

groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Our main result is a version of the disintegration
theorem that gives a bijective correspondence between representations of the
twisted groupoid Banach algebra $F(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ and covariant
representations of an inverse semigroup action. This powerful tool allows us to
study $F(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ in terms of representations of the Banach
algebra $C_0(X)$ and a (twisted) inverse semigroup $S$ of partial isometries
subject to some relations. This works best when the groupoid is ample or when
the target Banach algebra $B$ is a dual Banach algebra, for example when
$B=B(E)$ for a reflexive Banach space $E$. When $E=L^p(\mu)$ for $p\in
(1,\infty)\setminus \{2\}$ these relations force the partial isometries to be
spatial, which explains why Phillips and others define $L^p$-analogues of Cuntz
or graph algebras in terms of spatial partial isometries - the groupoid model
forces that.
  We introduce and analyze in more detail $L^p$-operator algebras
$F^{p}(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$, $p\in[1,\infty]$, which are universal for
representations of $F(\mathcal{G},\mathcal{L})$ on $L^p$-spaces, and which
generalize algebras $F^{p}(\mathcal{G})$ introduced recently by Gardella and
Lupini. As more concrete examples we discuss Banach (and $L^p$-operator
algebras) associated to twisted partial group actions, twisted Renault-Deaconu
groupoids and directed graphs. We also introduce tight inverse semigroup Banach
algebras that cover all ample groupoid Banach algebras.

  Perception and Prediction in Vision-Centric Autonomous Driving","CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-centric joint perception and prediction (PnP) has become an emerging
trend in autonomous driving research. It predicts the future states of the
traffic participants in the surrounding environment from raw RGB images.
However, it is still a critical challenge to synchronize features obtained at
multiple camera views and timestamps due to inevitable geometric distortions
and further exploit those spatial-temporal features. To address this issue, we
propose a temporal bird's-eye-view pyramid transformer (TBP-Former) for
vision-centric PnP, which includes two novel designs. First, a
pose-synchronized BEV encoder is proposed to map raw image inputs with any
camera pose at any time to a shared and synchronized BEV space for better
spatial-temporal synchronization. Second, a spatial-temporal pyramid
transformer is introduced to comprehensively extract multi-scale BEV features
and predict future BEV states with the support of spatial-temporal priors.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show that our proposed framework
overall outperforms all state-of-the-art vision-based prediction methods.

several paradigms, such as STIX, have become de facto standards in the CTI
community and dictate a formal categorization of different entities and
relations to enable organizations to share data consistently. This paper
presents STIXnet, the first solution for the automated extraction of all STIX
entities and relationships in CTI reports. Through the use of NLP techniques
and an interactive Knowledge Base (KB) of entities, our approach obtains F1
scores comparable to state-of-the-art models for entity extraction (0.916) and
relation extraction (0.724) while considering significantly more types of
entities and relations. Moreover, STIXnet constitutes a modular and extensible
framework that manages and coordinates different modules to merge their
contributions uniquely and exhaustively. With our approach, researchers and

integrating the efforts of several techniques without needing to develop new

the direct application of our results in astrophysical codes we present

$Q_\mathrm{imp}\approx 1-4$, while for Kepler ashes $Q_\mathrm{imp}$ decreases

the use of signal enhancement techniques to recover the full-bandwidth speech.
EBEN leverages a configurable multiband decomposition of the raw captured

create models of galaxies with a wide range of star-formation histories, dust
content, and interstellar medium properties. We fit the relations between
$M_\star$ and SFR with IR and optical photometry of the model-galaxy SEDs with
the MCMC method, and perform a machine-learning random forest analysis on the
same data set in order to validate the latter. This work provides calibrations
for the SFR using a combination of the WISE bands 1 and 3, or the JWST F200W

while they are given in the form of extinction-dependent and
extinction-independent relations. They show robust estimations while minimizing
the scatter and biases throughout a wide range of SFRs and stellar masses. The
SFR calibration offers better results, especially in dust-free or passive
galaxies where the contributions of old SPs or biases from the lack of dust are
significant. Similarly, the $M_\star$ calibration yields significantly better
results for dusty/high-SFR galaxies where dust emission can otherwise bias the

estimator that is a weighted average of IV estimates within each stratum,
weighing the stratum estimates by their estimated proportion of compliers. We
then explore the benefits of post-stratification in terms of bias reduction,
variance reduction, and improved standard error estimates, providing
derivations that identify the direction of bias as a function of the relative
means of the compliers and non-compliers. We also provide a finite-sample

Marvel Fusion is the use of p-11B fusion reactions, which would require already

generalizes the standard CRPS learning framework into multivariate dimensions.
It is based on Bernstein Online Aggregation (BOA) and yields optimal asymptotic
learning properties. We provide an in-depth discussion on possible extensions
of the algorithm and several nested cases related to the existing literature on
online forecast combination. The methodology is applied to forecasting
day-ahead electricity prices, which are 24-dimensional distributional
forecasts. The proposed method yields significant improvements over uniform

scheme with adaptive dissipation is proposed. With the standard TENO weighting
strategy, the cut-off parameter $C_T$ determines the nonlinear numerical
dissipation of the resultant TENO scheme. Moreover, according to the
dissipation-adaptive TENO5-A scheme, the choice of the cut-off parameter $C_T$
highly depends on the effective scale sensor. However, the scale sensor in
TENO5-A can only roughly detect the discontinuity locations instead of
evaluating the local flow wavenumber as desired. In this work, a new five-point
scale sensor, which can estimate the local flow wavenumber accurately, is
proposed to further improve the performance of TENO5-A. In combination with a
hyperbolic tangent function, the new scale sensor is deployed to the TENO5-A
framework for adapting the cut-off parameter $C_T$, i.e., the local nonlinear
dissipation, according to the local flow wavenumber. Overall, sufficient
numerical dissipation is generated to capture discontinuities, whereas a
minimum amount of dissipation is delivered for better resolving the smooth
flows. A set of benchmark cases is simulated to demonstrate the performance of
the new TENO5-A scheme.

physical machines often require long-lasting or expensive experiments.
Furthermore, the modeled physical dependencies exhibit nonlinear and

surrogate model should therefore address these problems by providing a scheme
to keep the number of queries small, e.g. by using active learning and be able
to capture the nonlinear and nonstationary properties of the system. One way of
modeling the nonstationarity is to induce input-partitioning, a principle that
has proven to be advantageous in active learning for Gaussian processes.
However, these methods either assume a known partitioning, need to introduce
complex sampling schemes or rely on very simple geometries. In this work, we
present a simple, yet powerful kernel family that incorporates a partitioning
that: i) is learnable via gradient-based methods, ii) uses a geometry that is
more flexible than previous ones, while still being applicable in the low data
regime. Thus, it provides a good prior for active learning procedures. We

day-ahead market and balancing markets. We propose a formulation for a combined
optimization model that computes an optimal distribution of flexibility between

specific bids for the day-ahead and balancing markets. Besides the expected
profits of each market and their individual bidding languages, our model also

penalty term that adds a cost to unfavorable load schedules. We evaluate the
optimization model in a rolling horizon case study based on the setting of a

to a lower energy state emitting a photon in the process. This is known as
spontaneous emission. It is one of the three elementary light-matter
interactions. If it has not decayed at time $t$, then the probability that it
does so in the next infinitesimal time step $[t, t+\delta t]$, is
$t$-independent. So there is no preferred time at which to decay -- in this
sense it is a random process. Here we show, by carefully engineering this
light-matter interaction, that we can associate it with a clock, where the
matter constitutes the clockwork and the spontaneous emission constitutes the
ticking of the clock. In particular, we show how to realise the quasi-ideal
clock. Said clock has been proven -- in an abstract and theoretic sense -- to
be the most accurate clock permissible by quantum theory, with a polynomial
enhancement in precision over the best stochastic clock of the same size. Our
results thus demonstrate that the seemingly random process of spontaneous
emission can in actual fact, under the right circumstances, be the most regular
one permissible by quantum theory. To achieve this we use geometric features
and flux-loop insertions to induce symmetry and Berry phases into the
light-matter coupling. We also study the entropy the clock produces per tick
and show that it also possesses a quantum advantage over that generated from
the previously known semi-classical clocks in the literature.

their convolution, which is commonly referred to as blind deconvolution.
Reformulation of blind deconvolution as a low-rank recovery problem has led to
multiple theoretical recovery guarantees in the past decade due to the success
of the nuclear norm minimization heuristic. In particular, in the absence of
noise, exact recovery has been established for sufficiently incoherent signals
contained in lower-dimensional subspaces. However, if the convolution is
corrupted by additive bounded noise, the stability of the recovery problem
remains much less understood. In particular, existing reconstruction bounds
involve large dimension factors and therefore fail to explain the empirical
evidence for dimension-independent robustness of nuclear norm minimization.
Recently, theoretical evidence has emerged for ill-posed behavior of low-rank
matrix recovery for sufficiently small noise levels. In this work, we develop
improved recovery guarantees for blind deconvolution with adversarial noise
which exhibit square-root scaling in the noise level. Hence, our results are
consistent with existing counterexamples which speak against linear scaling in
the noise level as demonstrated for related low-rank matrix recovery problems.

state-of-the-art tool for solving geophysical inverse problems within the

be obtained by adjoint methods, making the solution of tomographic problems
ultimately feasible. These results can be obtained with ""HMCLab"", a tool for
solving a range of different geophysical inverse problems using sampling

reliability to joint classification and segmentation tasks, leveraging mutual

evidential deep learning to provide image-level and pixel-wise confidences.
Then, an Uncertainty Navigator Decoder is constructed for better using mutual
features and generating segmentation results. Besides, an Uncertainty

UML could produce confidence estimation in features and performance for each

life under different conditions. If life can influence the climate evolution of
its planet then understanding the behaviour of life-climate feedbacks under
extreme conditions is key to determine the 'edges' of the habitable zone.
Additionally understanding the behaviour of a temperature limited biosphere
will help towards formulating biosignature predictions for alien life living
under conditions very different to those on Earth. Towards this aim, we extend
the 'ExoGaia Model' - an abstract model of microbial life living on a highly
simplified 0-dimensional planet. Via their metabolisms, microbes influence the
atmospheric composition and therefore the temperature of the planet and
emergent feedback loops allow microbes to regulate their climate and maintain
long term habitability. Here, we adapt the ExoGaia model to include temperature
adaptation of the microbes by allowing different species to have different
temperature 'preferences'. We find that rather than adapting towards the
planet's abiotic conditions the biosphere tends to more strongly influence the
climate of its planet, suggesting that the surface temperature of an inhabited
planet might be significantly different from that predicted using abiotic
models. We find that the success rate for microbial establishment on planets is
improved when adaptation is allowed. However, planetary abiotic context is
important for determining whether overall survival prospects for life will be
improved or degraded. These results indicate the necessity to develop an
understanding of life living under different limiting regimes to form
predictions for the boundaries of the habitable zone.

while their uncertainties are largely underexplored. Purpose: This work aims at
using deep learning to efficiently estimate posterior distributions of imaging
parameters, which in turn can be used to derive the most probable parameters as
well as their uncertainties. Methods: Our deep learning-based approaches are
based on a variational Bayesian inference framework, which is implemented using
two different deep neural networks based on conditional variational
auto-encoder (CVAE), CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder. The conventional
CVAE framework, i.e., CVAE-vanilla, can be regarded as a simplified case of
these two neural networks. We applied these approaches to a simulation study of
dynamic brain PET imaging using a reference region-based kinetic model.
Results: In the simulation study, we estimated posterior distributions of PET
kinetic parameters given a measurement of time-activity curve. Our proposed
CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder yield results that are in good
agreement with the asymptotically unbiased posterior distributions sampled by
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The CVAE-vanilla can also be used for
estimating posterior distributions, although it has an inferior performance to
both CVAE-dual-encoder and CVAE-dual-decoder. Conclusions: We have evaluated
the performance of our deep learning approaches for estimating posterior
distributions in dynamic brain PET. Our deep learning approaches yield
posterior distributions, which are in good agreement with unbiased
distributions estimated by MCMC. All these neural networks have different
characteristics and can be chosen by the user for specific applications. The
proposed methods are general and can be adapted to other problems.

federated learning (FL). Recent studies have identified the biased classifiers
of local models as the key bottleneck. Previous attempts have used classifier
calibration after FL training, but this approach falls short in improving the
poor feature representations caused by training-time classifier biases.
Resolving the classifier bias dilemma in FL requires a full understanding of
the mechanisms behind the classifier. Recent advances in neural collapse have
shown that the classifiers and feature prototypes under perfect training
scenarios collapse into an optimal structure called simplex equiangular tight
frame (ETF). Building on this neural collapse insight, we propose a solution to
the FL's classifier bias problem by utilizing a synthetic and fixed ETF
classifier during training. The optimal classifier structure enables all
clients to learn unified and optimal feature representations even under
extremely heterogeneous data. We devise several effective modules to better
adapt the ETF structure in FL, achieving both high generalization and
personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet.

conceivable. We show that a disturbance field generated by a body immersed in
an ambient flow can be expressed as a multipole expansion the coefficients of
which are the moments of the volume forces, independently on the boundary
conditions. We find that the dualism between the operator giving the
disturbance field of an $n$-th order ambient flow and the $n$-th order Fax\'en
operator, referred to as the Hinch-Kim dualism, holds only if the boundary
conditions satisfy a property that we call \textit{Boundary-Condition
reciprocity} (BC-reciprocity). If this property is fulfilled, the Fax\'en
operators can be expressed in terms of the $(m,n)$-th order geometrical moments
of the volume forces (defined in the article), thus generalizing the Brenner's
expression for the Fax\'en operators for forces and torques on rigid bodies
with no-slip boundary conditions. Finally, classical boundary conditions of
hydrodynamic practice are investigated in the light of this property: boundary
conditions for rigid bodies, Newtonian drops at the mechanical equilibrium,
porous bodies modeled by the Brinkman equations are BC-reciprocal, while
deforming linear elastic bodies, deforming Newtonian drops, non-Newtonian drops
and porous bodies modeled by the Darcy equations do not have this property. For
Navier-slip boundary conditions on a rigid body, we find that $n$-th order
Fax\'en operator are determined by the $n$-th order surface tractions, and the

Prefix, can adapt a pre-trained model to downstream tasks with fewer parameters
and resources. Given a PET method, our LAE framework incorporates it for CL
with three novel designs. 1) Learning: the pre-trained model adapts to the new
task by tuning an online PET module, along with our adaptation speed
calibration to align different PET modules, 2) Accumulation: the task-specific
knowledge learned by the online PET module is accumulated into an offline PET
module through momentum update, 3) Ensemble: During inference, we respectively
construct two experts with online/offline PET modules (which are favored by the
novel/historical tasks) for prediction ensemble. We show that LAE is compatible
with a battery of PET methods and gains strong CL capability. For example, LAE
with Adaptor PET surpasses the prior state-of-the-art by 1.3% and 3.6% in

Numerically solving the spherical Jeans equation, we parameterize the dynamical

The mass-velocity anisotropy degeneracy is broken by using two ""virial shape
parameters"" that depend on the fourth moment of velocity distribution. The
resulting velocity anisotropy estimates consistently show a nearly isotropic
distribution in the inner regions, with an increasing radial anisotropy towards
large radii. We compare our derived dynamical masses with those calculated from
X-ray gas data assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, finding that massive and rich
relaxed clusters generally present consistent mass measurements, while
unrelaxed or low-richness clusters have systematically larger total mass than
hydrostatic mass by an average of 50\%. This might help alleviate current
tensions in the measurement of $\sigma_8$, but it also leads to cluster baryon
fractions below the cosmic value. Finally, our approach probes accelerations as
low as $10^{-11}$ m s$^{-2}$, comparable to the outskirts of individual
late-type galaxies. We confirm that galaxy clusters deviate from the radial
acceleration relation defined by galaxies.

anesthetic administration and free anesthesiologists from repetitive tasks,
allowing them to focus on the most critical aspects of a patient's surgical
care. Current research has typically focused on creating simulated environments
from which agents can learn. These approaches have demonstrated good
experimental results, but are still far from clinical application. In this
paper, Policy Constraint Q-Learning (PCQL), a data-driven reinforcement
learning algorithm for solving the problem of learning anesthesia strategies on
real clinical datasets, is proposed. Conservative Q-Learning was first
introduced to alleviate the problem of Q function overestimation in an offline
context. A policy constraint term is added to agent training to keep the policy
distribution of the agent and the anesthesiologist consistent to ensure safer
decisions made by the agent in anesthesia scenarios. The effectiveness of PCQL
was validated by extensive experiments on a real clinical anesthesia dataset.
Experimental results show that PCQL is predicted to achieve higher gains than
the baseline approach while maintaining good agreement with the reference dose
given by the anesthesiologist, using less total dose, and being more responsive
to the patient's vital signs. In addition, the confidence intervals of the
agent were investigated, which were able to cover most of the clinical
decisions of the anesthesiologist. Finally, an interpretable method, SHAP, was
used to analyze the contributing components of the model predictions to
increase the transparency of the model.

and Efficient), is proposed for high-dimensional datasets. The SFE algorithm
performs its search process using a search agent and two operators:
non-selection and selection. It comprises two phases: exploration and
exploitation. In the exploration phase, the non-selection operator performs a
global search in the entire problem search space for the irrelevant, redundant,
trivial, and noisy features, and changes the status of the features from
selected mode to non-selected mode. In the exploitation phase, the selection
operator searches the problem search space for the features with a high impact
on the classification results, and changes the status of the features from
non-selected mode to selected mode. The proposed SFE is successful in feature
selection from high-dimensional datasets. However, after reducing the
dimensionality of a dataset, its performance cannot be increased significantly.
In these situations, an evolutionary computational method could be used to find
a more efficient subset of features in the new and reduced search space. To
overcome this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid algorithm, SFE-PSO (particle
swarm optimization) to find an optimal feature subset. The efficiency and
effectiveness of the SFE and the SFE-PSO for feature selection are compared on
40 high-dimensional datasets. Their performances were compared with six
recently proposed feature selection algorithms. The results obtained indicate
that the two proposed algorithms significantly outperform the other algorithms,
and can be used as efficient and effective algorithms in selecting features
from high-dimensional datasets.

prediction of atmospheric drag may result in poor prediction accuracies. In
this context, we explore the possibility to perform a paradigm shift, from a
physics-based approach to a data-driven approach. To this aim, we present the
development of a deep learning model for the re-entry prediction of
uncontrolled objects in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The model is based on a modified

altitude profile as derived from a set of Two-Line Element (TLE) data of over

learning research. Its goal is to go beyond classical assumptions in machine
learning and develop models and learning strategies that present high
robustness in dynamic environments. The landscape of CL research is fragmented
into several learning evaluation protocols, comprising different learning
tasks, datasets, and evaluation metrics. Additionally, the benchmarks adopted
so far are still distant from the complexity of real-world scenarios, and are
usually tailored to highlight capabilities specific to certain strategies. In
such a landscape, it is hard to objectively assess strategies. In this work, we
fill this gap for CL on image data by introducing two novel CL benchmarks that
involve multiple heterogeneous tasks from six image datasets, with varying
levels of complexity and quality. Our aim is to fairly evaluate current
state-of-the-art CL strategies on a common ground that is closer to complex
real-world scenarios. We additionally structure our benchmarks so that tasks
are presented in increasing and decreasing order of complexity -- according to
a curriculum -- in order to evaluate if current CL models are able to exploit
structure across tasks. We devote particular emphasis to providing the CL
community with a rigorous and reproducible evaluation protocol for measuring
the ability of a model to generalize and not to forget while learning.
Furthermore, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation showing that
popular CL strategies, when challenged with our benchmarks, yield sub-par
performance, high levels of forgetting, and present a limited ability to
effectively leverage curriculum task ordering. We believe that these results
highlight the need for rigorous comparisons in future CL works as well as pave
the way to design new CL strategies that are able to deal with more complex
scenarios.

for graph neural networks (GNNs -- is critical for real-world applications.
During the message passing (MP) in GNNs, subgraph-wise sampling methods discard
messages outside the mini-batches in backward passes to avoid the well-known
neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the exponentially increasing dependencies of
nodes with the number of MP iterations. However, discarding messages may
sacrifice the gradient estimation accuracy, posing significant challenges to
their convergence analysis and convergence speeds. To address this challenge,
we propose a novel subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee,
namely Local Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is
the first subgraph-wise sampling method with provable convergence. The key idea
is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message
passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective
compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes,
LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence.
Moreover, LMC is applicable to various MP-based GNN architectures, including
convolutional GNNs (finite message passing iterations with different layers)
and recurrent GNNs (infinite message passing iterations with a shared layer).
Experiments on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that LMC is significantly
faster than state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods.

positive predictions, which informs the subject of ways to improve. Various
properties of CF explanations have been studied, such as validity, feasibility
and stability. In this paper, we contribute a novel aspect: their behaviors
under iterative partial fulfillment (IPF). Specifically, upon receiving a CF
explanation, the subject may only partially fulfills it before requesting a new
prediction with a new explanation, and repeat until the prediction is positive.
Such partial fulfillment could be due to the subject's limited capability
(e.g., can only pay down two out of four credit card accounts at this moment)

of \$800 is enough even though \$1,000 is recommended). Does such iterative
partial fulfillment increase or decrease the total cost of improvement incurred
by the subject? We first propose a mathematical formalization of IPF and then
demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that different CF algorithms
exhibit vastly different behaviors under IPF and hence different effects on the
subject's welfare, warranting this factor to be considered in the studies of CF
algorithms. We discuss implications of our observations and give several

limited accuracy constrains their clinical usage. In this paper, we present a
new Transformer-based architecture, Higher Dimensional Transformer (HDformer),
which takes long-range photoplethysmography (PPG) signals to detect diabetes.
The long-range PPG contains broader and deeper signal contextual information
compared to the less-than-one-minute PPG signals commonly utilized in existing
research. To increase the capability and efficiency of processing the long
range data, we propose a new attention module Time Square Attention (TSA),
reducing the volume of the tokens by more than 10x, while retaining the
local/global dependencies. It converts the 1-dimensional inputs into
2-dimensional representations and groups adjacent points into a single 2D
token, using the 2D Transformer models as the backbone of the encoder. It
generates the dynamic patch sizes into a gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) network
as decoder, which optimizes the learning on different attention areas.
Extensive experimentations show that HDformer results in the state-of-the-art
performance (sensitivity 98.4, accuracy 97.3, specificity 92.8, and AUC 0.929)
on the standard MIMIC-III dataset, surpassing existing studies. This work is
the first time to take long-range, non-invasive PPG signals via Transformer for

signal processing, then based on deep learning to automatically detect the
phenomenon of chatter in machining. To do so, we use input images from the Fast
Fourier Transform analysis of a vibration signal from the machining of an
Alstom industrial railway system. The FFT images are first cropped in height to
perform a renormalization of the signal scale. This renormalization step
eliminates a bias regularly observed in the literature, which did not eliminate
a simple correlation with signal amplitude because chatter is often, but not
always, associated with stronger vibrations. Deep learning extracted features
from the image data by exploiting pre-trained deep neural networks such as
VGG16 and ResNet50. The data is derived from an industrial vibration signal
(with noise, a not ideally placed sensors, and uncertainties on process
parameters), which was very poorly represented in the literature. It is shown
that by depleting the signal (renormalized amplitude and absence of information
on the rotation speed), the model obtains a good result (an accuracy of 99% in
the training and validation phases), which had never been done in the
literature. In addition, since a part of the test dataset is similar to the
training dataset, the proposed model obtains an accuracy of 98.82%. The
robustness is proved by adding another test dataset containing noisy and more
or less ambiguous images to be classified. The model still manages to detect
these cases from its training of unambiguous cases, showing that the obtained
generalization is efficient with an accuracy of 73.71%.

associated with a conservative political leaning, the moral values expressed by
its adherents diverge from the ones typically used by conservatives. In
particular, the expected emphasis on the values of authority and purity is
accompanied by an atypical dearth of in-group loyalty. We find that after the
mandate, both pro- and anti-mask sides decrease their emphasis on care about

politicizing the issue. In addition, the mask mandate reverses the expression

  Progression of Barrett's Esophagus",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Barrett's Esophagus (BE) is the only precursor known to Esophageal
Adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of esophageal cancer with poor prognosis upon
diagnosis. Therefore, diagnosing BE is crucial in preventing and treating
esophageal cancer. While supervised machine learning supports BE diagnosis,
high interobserver variability in histopathological training data limits these
methods. Unsupervised representation learning via Variational Autoencoders
(VAEs) shows promise, as they map input data to a lower-dimensional manifold
with only useful features, characterizing BE progression for improved
downstream tasks and insights. However, the VAE's Euclidean latent space
distorts point relationships, hindering disease progression modeling. Geometric
VAEs provide additional geometric structure to the latent space, with RHVAE
assuming a Riemannian manifold and $\mathcal{S}$-VAE a hyperspherical manifold.
Our study shows that $\mathcal{S}$-VAE outperforms vanilla VAE with better
reconstruction losses, representation classification accuracies, and
higher-quality generated images and interpolations in lower-dimensional
settings. By disentangling rotation information from the latent space, we
improve results further using a group-based architecture. Additionally, we take
initial steps towards $\mathcal{S}$-AE, a novel autoencoder model generating
qualitative images without a variational framework, but retaining benefits of
autoencoders such as stability and reconstruction quality.

in the context of the modern parametric feature-based CAD paradigm. Realizing
its full potential, however, requires a closed loop between CAD and CAE (i.e.,
CAD/CAE integration) with automatic design modifications and simulation
updates. Conventionally the approach of model conversion is often employed to
form the loop, but this way of working is hard to automate and requires manual
inputs. As a result, the overall optimization process is too laborious to be
acceptable. To address this issue, a new method for parametric optimization is
introduced in this paper, based on a unified model representation scheme called
eXtended Voxels (XVoxels). This scheme hybridizes feature models and voxel
models into a new concept of semantic voxels, where the voxel part is
responsible for FEM solving, and the semantic part is responsible for
high-level information to capture both design and simulation intents. As such,
it can establish a direct mapping between design models and analysis models,
which in turn enables automatic updates on simulation results for design
modifications, and vice versa -- effectively a closed loop between CAD and CAE.
In addition, robust and efficient geometric algorithms for manipulating XVoxel
models and efficient numerical methods (based on the recent finite cell method)
for simulating XVoxel models are provided. The presented method has been
validated by a series of case studies of increasing complexity to demonstrate
its effectiveness. In particular, a computational efficiency improvement of up
to 55.8 times the existing FCM method has been seen.

materials traditionally requires equally many human hours spent measuring
samples one by one. We demonstrate that with the integration of computer vision
into this material research workflow, many of these tasks can be automated,
significantly accelerating the throughput of the workflow for scientists. We
present a framework that uses vision to address specific pain points in the
characterization of perovskite semiconductors, a group of materials with the
potential to form new types of solar cells. With this approach, we automate the
measurement and computation of chemical and optoelectronic properties of
perovskites. Our framework proposes the following four key contributions: (i) a
computer vision tool for scalable segmentation to arbitrarily many material
samples, (ii) a tool to extract the chemical composition of all material
samples, (iii) an algorithm capable of automatically computing band gap across
arbitrarily many unique samples using vision-segmented hyperspectral
reflectance data, and (iv) automating the stability measurement of multi-hour
perovskite degradation experiments with vision for spatially non-uniform
samples. We demonstrate the key contributions of the proposed framework on
eighty samples of unique composition from the formamidinium-methylammonium lead
tri-iodide perovskite system and validate the accuracy of each method using
human evaluation and X-ray diffraction.

intercalation of the layered iron-selenide host by organic molecular donors,
aiming at the formation of the expanded lattice $Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$

tetragonal $ThCr_2Si_2$-type structure at the average level, however, with an
enhanced interlayer iron-selenide spacing (d= 16.2 \r{A}) that accommodates the
heterocyclic molecular spacers. Quantitative atomic pair distribution function
(PDF) analysis at variable times, suggests distorted $FeSe_4$ tetrahedral local
environments that appear swollen with respect to those in the parent
$\beta$-FeSe. Simultaneously acquired, in-situ synchrotron X-ray powder
diffraction data disclose that secondary phases ($\alpha$-Fe and $Li_2Se$),
grow significantly when higher Li-concentration is used in the solvothermal
reaction or when the solution is aged. These observations are in line with the
strongly reducing character of the intercalation medium's solvated electrons
that mediate the defect chemistry of the expanded lattice superconductor. In
the latter, intralayer correlated local distortions indicate electron donating
aspects that reflect in somewhat enlarged Fe-Se bonds. They also reveal a
degree of relief of chemical pressure associated with a large distance between
Fe and Se sheets ('taller' anion height) and a stretched Fe-Fe square planar
topology. The elongation of the latter, derived from the in-situ PDF study,
speaks for a plausible increase in the Fe-site vacancy concentration. The
evolution of the local structural parameters suggests an optimum reaction
window where kinetically stabilized phases resemble the distortions of the
edge-sharing Fe-Se tetrahedra, required for high-$T_c$ in expanded lattice
iron-chalcogenides.

detecting guns in real-world CCTV images remains a challenging and

size, non-salient in appearance, and often severely occluded or
indistinguishable from other small objects. Additionally, the lack of

challenges of detecting handguns in real-world CCTV images. Our contribution is
three-fold. Firstly, we carefully select and analyze real-world CCTV images
from three datasets, manually annotate handguns and their holders, and assign
each image with relevant challenge factors such as blur and occlusion.
Secondly, we propose a new cross-dataset evaluation protocol in addition to the
standard intra-dataset protocol, which is vital for gun detection in practical

infinitesimal version of the ''highway hierarchy'' method which has been
developed to solve shortest path problems (with discrete time and discrete

sub-domain of the state space. We show that the sequence obtained in this way
does converge to the viscosity solution of the HJ equation. Moreover, for our
multi-level algorithm, if $0<\gamma \leq 1$ is the convergence rate of the
classical numerical scheme, then the number of arithmetic operations needed to
obtain an error in $O(\varepsilon)$ is in
$\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{\theta d}{\gamma}})$, to be compared with
$\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{d}{\gamma}})$ for ordinary grid-based
methods. Here $d$ is the dimension of the problem, and $\theta <1$ depends on
$d$ and on the ''stiffness"" of the value function around optimal trajectories,

in this paper, we propose a novel NeRF-based LiDAR odometry and mapping
approach, NeRF-LOAM, consisting of three modules neural odometry, neural

signed distance function, which separates LiDAR points into ground and

embeddings concurrently, and in the end generates dense smooth mesh maps of the

result matches the one-loop perturbative expression, as expected. The CWIs for

$\phi(x)$ over finite $L$-structures, for a language $L$, as the limit of the
probability of $\phi(x)$ to be typical in an arbitrary $L$-structure ${\cal M}$
of cardinality $n$, when $n$ goes to infinity. This poses the question whether
the 0-1 law holds for typicality degrees for certain kinds of languages. One of
the results of the paper is that, in contrast to the classical well-known fact
that the 0-1 law holds for the sentences of every relational language, the 0-1
law fails for degrees of properties of relational languages containing unary

some basic properties of graphs, and this gives rise to the conjecture that the
0-1 law holds for relational languages without unary predicates. Another theme
is the ``neutrality'' degree of a property $\phi(x)$ ( i.e., the fraction of
$L$-structures in which neither $\phi$ nor $\neg \phi$ is typical), and in
particular the ``regular'' properties (i.e., those with limit neutrality degree

correlation of the interlayer spacing with the enhancement of the

allow to discuss how the important rise of $T_c$ (44 K) in the molecule
intercalated $\rm Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$ relates to the electronic and

shows that widely-separated layers of edge-sharing $\rm FeSe_4$ tetrahedra,
carry low-spin moieties with a local Fe magnetic moment slightly reduced
compared to the parent $\beta$-$\rm Fe_{2-z}Se_2$. Pre-edge $XAS$ advises on
the progressively reduced mixing of metal $3d-4p$ states upon lithiation.
Doping-mediated local lattice modifications, probed by conventional
$T_c$-optimization measures (cf. anion height and $FeSe_4$ tetrahedra
regularity), become less relevant when layers are spaced far away. On the basis
of extended x-ray absorption fine structure, such distortions are compensated
by a softer Fe-network that relates to Fe-site vacancies, alleviating
electron-lattice correlations and superconductivity. Density functional theory
($DFT$) guided modification of isolated $\rm Fe_{2-z}Se_2$ ($z$, vacant sites)
planes, resembling the host layers, identify that Fe-site deficiency occurs at
low energy cost, giving rise to stretched Fe-sheets, in accord with
experiments. The robust high-$T_c$ in $\rm Li_x(C_5H_5N)_yFe_{2-z}Se_2$, arises
from the interplay of electron donating spacers and the iron-selenide layers

subset of layers or customizing different learning rates for each layer can
greatly improve robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) data and retain
generalization capability in the pre-trained models. However, most of these
methods employ manually crafted heuristics or expensive hyper-parameter
searches, which prevent them from scaling up to large datasets and neural
networks. To solve this problem, we propose Trainable Projected Gradient Method
(TPGM) to automatically learn the constraint imposed for each layer for a
fine-grained fine-tuning regularization. This is motivated by formulating
fine-tuning as a bi-level constrained optimization problem. Specifically, TPGM
maintains a set of projection radii, i.e., distance constraints between the
fine-tuned model and the pre-trained model, for each layer, and enforces them
through weight projections. To learn the constraints, we propose a bi-level
optimization to automatically learn the best set of projection radii in an
end-to-end manner. Theoretically, we show that the bi-level optimization
formulation could explain the regularization capability of TPGM. Empirically,
with little hyper-parameter search cost, TPGM outperforms existing fine-tuning
methods in OOD performance while matching the best in-distribution (ID)
performance. For example, when fine-tuned on DomainNet-Real and ImageNet,
compared to vanilla fine-tuning, TPGM shows $22\%$ and $10\%$ relative OOD
improvement respectively on their sketch counterparts. Code is available at

from machine learning (ML)-enabled components such as speech recognition and
voice activity detection. However, these systems don't yet work well for
everyone. They exhibit bias - the systematic and unfair discrimination against
individuals or cohorts of individuals in favour of others (Friedman &
Nissembaum, 1996) - across axes such as age, gender and accent.
  ML is reliant on large datasets for training. Dataset documentation is
designed to give ML Practitioners (MLPs) a better understanding of a dataset's
characteristics. However, there is a lack of empirical research on voice
dataset documentation specifically. Additionally, while MLPs are frequent
participants in fairness research, little work focuses on those who work with
voice data. Our work makes an empirical contribution to this gap.
  Here, we combine two methods to form an exploratory study. First, we
undertake 13 semi-structured interviews, exploring multiple perspectives of
voice dataset documentation practice. Using open and axial coding methods, we
explore MLPs' practices through the lenses of roles and tradeoffs. Drawing from
this work, we then purposively sample voice dataset documents (VDDs) for 9
voice datasets. Our findings then triangulate these two methods, using the
lenses of MLP roles and trade-offs. We find that current VDD practices are
inchoate, inadequate and incommensurate. The characteristics of voice datasets
are codified in fragmented, disjoint ways that often do not meet the needs of
MLPs. Moreover, they cannot be readily compared, presenting a barrier to
practitioners' bias reduction efforts.
  We then discuss the implications of these findings for bias practices in
voice data and speech technologies. We conclude by setting out a program of
future work to address these findings -- that is, how we may ""right the docs"".

the relative reduction of the organisms' infection risk accentuating in surges

Additionally, the sparse deep Boltzmann network can generate new handwritten

different transportation circumstances. In this context, Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML), the automation of the ML workflow from data preprocessing to
model validation, arises as a promising strategy to deal with the MSP in
problem domains wherein expert ML knowledge is not always an available or
affordable asset, such as TF. Various AutoML frameworks have been used to
approach the MSP in TF. Most are based on online optimisation processes to
search for the best-performing pipeline on a given dataset. This online
optimisation could be complemented with meta-learning to warm-start the search
phase and/or the construction of ensembles using pipelines derived from the

which describes the motion of bacteria suspended in a Navier-Stokes fluid and
attracted by a chemical (oxygen). Employing the vorticity formulation for the
fluid equations, we obtain local and global solutions with large (Radon)
measures as initial data for the bacterial density and vorticity. The
gravitational/centrifugal potential is taken with finite $L^{2}$-gradient that
can be large. The uniqueness property is also discussed. For the global result,
we need to assume a smallness condition only on the $L^{\infty}$-norm of the
initial oxygen concentration. In comparison with previous works, our results
provide a new class for the initial density and vorticity, as well as for the
potential, covering particularly singular measures such as Dirac delta, measure
concentrated on smooth curves (filaments and rings), among others. For that, we
approach the system via critical functional spaces, Kato-type norms, and
suitable $L^{p}$-estimates uniformly in time.

discrete scheme at the convective limit, only considering flow with acoustic
effects empirically, if at all. In our recent paper Hope-Collins & di Mare,
2023 we derived constraints on the artificial diffusion scaling of low Mach
number schemes for flows both with and without acoustic effects, and applied
this analysis to Roe-type finite-volume schemes. In this paper we form
approximate diffusion matrices for the Liou-Steffen splitting, as well as the
closely related Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings. We use the constraints
found in Hope-Collins & di Mare, 2023 to derive and analyse the required

matrices to the entropy variables we can identify erroneous diffusion terms

vanish asymptotically for the Liou-Steffen splitting, but result in spurious
entropy generation for the Zha-Bilgen and Toro-Vasquez splittings unless a

virus-like vesicles and human-host-cell-like vesicles we were able to follow
the fusion of the respective vesicles in real-time. This was done using
deuterated and protonated phospholipids in the vesicles in a neutron-contrast
matched solvent. The vesicles were identical apart from either the presence or
absence of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein. The human-host-cell-like vesicles were
carrying an ACE2 receptor protein in all cases. In case of the absence of the
spike protein a fusion over several hours was observed in agreement with
literature, with a time constant of 4.5 h. In comparison, there was not
time-evolution, but immediate fusion of the vesicles when the spike protein was
present. Those two figures, fusion over several hours and fusion below 10 s
corresponding to the absence or presence of the spike protein allow an
upper-limit estimate for the fusion times of virus-like vesicles with the
SARS-CoV2 spike protein of 10 s. This very fast fusion, when compared to the
case without spike protein it is a factor of 2500, can also help to explain why
infection with SARS-CoV2 can be so effective and fast. Studying spike protein
variants using our method may explain differences in transmissibility between
SARS-CoV2 strains. In addition, the model developed here can potentially be

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under the general non-realizable smooth SCO
setting, suggesting that existing stability analyses are tight in step-size and
iteration dependence, and that overfitting provably happens. Next, we study the
case when the loss is realizable, i.e. an optimal solution minimizes all the
data points. Recent works show better rates can be attained but the improvement
is reduced when training time is long. Our paper examines this observation by
providing excess risk lower bounds for GD and SGD in two realizable settings:
1) $\eta T = \bigO{n}$, and (2) $\eta T = \bigOmega{n}$, where $n$ is the size
of dataset. In the first case $\eta T = \bigOmega{n}$, our lower bounds tightly
match and certify the respective upper bounds. However, for the case $\eta T =
\bigOmega{n}$, our analysis indicates a gap between the lower and upper bounds.
A conjecture is proposed that the gap can be closed by improving upper bounds,
supported by analyses in two special scenarios.

captioning due to their effective representation learning and context-based
content generation capabilities. As a prominent type of deep features used in
many of the recent image captioning methods, the well-known bottomup features
provide a detailed representation of different objects of the image in
comparison with the feature maps directly extracted from the raw image.
However, the lack of high-level semantic information about the relationships
between these objects is an important drawback of bottom-up features, despite
their expensive and resource-demanding extraction procedure. To take advantage
of visual relationships in caption generation, this paper proposes a deep
neural network architecture for image captioning based on fusing the visual
relationships information extracted from an image's scene graph with the
spatial feature maps of the image. A multi-modal reward function is then
introduced for deep reinforcement learning of the proposed network using a
combination of language and vision similarities in a common embedding space.
The results of extensive experimentation on the MSCOCO dataset show the
effectiveness of using visual relationships in the proposed captioning method.
Moreover, the results clearly indicate that the proposed multi-modal reward in
deep reinforcement learning leads to better model optimization, outperforming
several state-of-the-art image captioning algorithms, while using light and
easy to extract image features. A detailed experimental study of the components
constituting the proposed method is also presented.

10-15 . We achieved the best upper limit to date at low and high frequencies of
the PTA band thanks to improved effective cadence of observations. In our
analysis, we have taken into account the recently discovered common red noise

in the discovery and studies of graphene. In the past two decades, another
transistor based on conducting polymers called the organic electrochemical
transistor (ECT) was shown and largely studied. The main difference between
ECTs and FETs is the mode and extent of channel doping: while in FETs the
channel only has surface doping through dipoles, the mixed ionic-electronic
conductivity of the channel material in Organic ECTs enables bulk
electrochemical doping. As a result, the organic ECT maximizes conductance
modulation at the expense of speed. Until now ECTs have been based on
conducting polymers, but here we show for the first time that MXenes, a class
of 2D materials beyond graphene, have mixed ionic-electronic properties that
enable the realization of electrochemical transistors (ECTs). We show that the
formulas for organic ECTs can be applied to these 2D ECTs and used to extract
parameters like mobility. These MXene ECTs have high transconductance values
but low on-off ratios. We further show that conductance switching data measured
using ECT in combination with other in-situ ex-situ electrochemical
measurements, is a powerful tool for correlating the change in conductance to
that of redox state: to our knowledge, this is the first report of this
important correlation for MXene films. Many future possibilities exist for
MXenes ECTs, and we think other 2D materials with bandgaps can also form ECTs
with single or heterostructured 2D materials. 2D ECTs can draw great
inspiration and theoretical tools from the field of organic ECTs and have the
potential to considerably extend the capabilities of transistors beyond that of
conducting polymer ECTs, with added properties such as extreme heat resistance,
tolerance for solvents, and higher conductivity for both electrons and ions

output states, the brain is at risk for hypoxic-ischemic injury. The metabolic
rate and oxygen consumption of the brain are reflected in internal jugular
venous oxygen saturation (sijvO2). The current gold standard for monitoring
brain oxygenation is invasive; it requires jugular vein catheterization under
fluoroscopic guidance and therefore is rarely used. Photoacoustic (PA)
measurement, on the other hand, can estimate the oxygen consumption of the
brain non-invasively in real time. Such a convenient method can potentially aid
earlier detection and prevention of impending hypoxic brain injury. A
dual-wavelength photoacoustic tomography (PAT) and ultrasound imaging (US)
system was used to image the internal jugular vein (IJV) and estimate the
sijvO2 in seven healthy volunteers. The system captured simultaneous
co-registered PAT and US images at a rate of five frames per second. For each
volunteer, the internal jugular vein was identified under ultrasound guidance,
then, additional PA images from two optical wavelengths were collected and used
to estimate the oxygen saturation of the internal jugular vein. For each
volunteer, the oxygen saturation was calculated from transverse and
longitudinal views of the internal jugular vein. The average sijvO2 was 72 +/-
7 %. The preliminary results are encouraging and agree with those reported in
the literature. Photoacoustic images were successfully used to calculate the
blood hemoglobin oxygen saturation in the internal jugular vein. These results
raise confidence that this emerging technology can be used clinically for
accurate, noninvasive estimation of sijvO2. In addition, the fast
co-registration with US images makes the technique suitable for studying the

contexts, from human-made systems such as water supply networks to living
systems like animal and plant vasculature. In many cases, the elements forming
these networks exhibit a highly non-linear pressure-flow relationship. Although
we understand how these elements work individually, their collective behavior
remains poorly understood. In this work, we combine experiments, theory, and
numerical simulations to understand the main mechanisms underlying the
collective behavior of soft flow networks with elements that exhibit negative
differential resistance. Strikingly, our theoretical analysis and experiments
reveal that a minimal network of nonlinear resistors, which we have termed a
`fluidic memristor', displays history-dependent resistance. This new class of
element can be understood as a collection of hysteresis loops that allows this
fluidic system to store information. Our work provides insights that may inform
new applications of fluid flow networks in soft materials science, biomedical
settings, and soft robotics, and may also motivate new understanding of the
flow networks involved in animal and plant physiology.

include a temporal alignment step via dynamic time warping (DTW). Existing
approaches to differentiable DTW either differentiate through a fixed warping
path or apply a differentiable relaxation to the min operator found in the
recursive steps used to solve the DTW problem. We instead propose a DTW layer
based around bi-level optimisation and deep declarative networks, which we name
DecDTW. By formulating DTW as a continuous, inequality constrained optimisation
problem, we can compute gradients for the solution of the optimal alignment
(with respect to the underlying time series) using implicit differentiation. An
interesting byproduct of this formulation is that DecDTW outputs the optimal
warping path between two time series as opposed to a soft approximation,
recoverable from Soft-DTW. We show that this property is particularly useful
for applications where downstream loss functions are defined on the optimal
alignment path itself. This naturally occurs, for instance, when learning to
improve the accuracy of predicted alignments against ground truth alignments.
We evaluate DecDTW on two such applications, namely the audio-to-score
alignment task in music information retrieval and the visual place recognition
task in robotics, demonstrating state-of-the-art results in both.

classical computers is therefore essential to advance the understanding of how
quantum computers and programs operate, enabling both algorithm discovery that
leads to high-impact quantum computation and engineering improvements that
deliver to more powerful quantum systems. Unfortunately, the nature of quantum
information causes simulation complexity to scale exponentially with problem
size. In this paper, we debut Super.tech's SuperSim framework, a new approach
for high fidelity and scalable quantum circuit simulation. SuperSim employs two
key techniques for accelerated quantum circuit simulation: Clifford-based
simulation and circuit cutting. Through the isolation of Clifford subcircuit
fragments within a larger non-Clifford circuit, resource-efficient Clifford
simulation can be invoked, leading to significant reductions in runtime. After
fragments are independently executed, circuit cutting and recombination
procedures allow the final output of the original circuit to be reconstructed
from fragment execution results. Through the combination of these two
state-of-art techniques, SuperSim is a product for quantum practitioners that
allows quantum circuit evaluation to scale beyond the frontiers of current
simulators. Our results show that Clifford-based circuit cutting accelerates
the simulation of near-Clifford circuits, allowing 100s of qubits to be

model four separate CMEs observed in situ by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). We vary
the input photospheric conditions using four input magnetograms (HMI
Synchronic, HMI Synoptic, GONG Synoptic Zero-Point Corrected, and GONG ADAPT).
To vary the coronal field reconstruction, we employ the Potential-Field
Source-Surface (PFSS) model and we vary its source-surface height in the range
1.5--3.0 R$_{\odot}$ with 0.1 R$_{\odot}$ increments. Results: We find that
both the input magnetogram and PFSS source surface often affect the evolution
of the CME as it propagates through the Sun's corona into interplanetary space,
and therefore the accuracy of the MFR prediction compared to in-situ data at
PSP. There is no obvious best combination of input magnetogram and PFSS source
surface height. Conclusions: The OSPREI model is moderately sensitive to the
input photospheric and coronal conditions. Based on where the source region of

difficult task for automated segmentation methods and can be crucial for

for medical image segmentation and is frequently used as a common baseline in
medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we develop a multiple decoder
U-net architecture where a noisy auxiliary decoder is used to generate noisy
segmentation. The segmentation from the main branch and the noisy segmentation
from the auxiliary branch are used together to estimate the attention. Our
contribution is the development of a new attention module which derives the
attention from the softmax probabilities of two decoder branches. The union and
intersection of two segmentation masks from two branches carry the information
where both decoders agree and disagree. The softmax probabilities from regions
of agreement and disagreement are the indicators of low and high uncertainty.
Thus, the probabilities of those selected regions are used as attention in the
bottleneck layer of the encoder and passes only through the main decoder for
segmentation. For accurate contour segmentation, we also developed a CT
intensity integrated regularization loss. We tested our model on two publicly
available OAR challenge datasets, Segthor and LCTSC respectively. We trained 12
models on each dataset with and without the proposed attention model and
regularization loss to check the effectiveness of the attention module and the

calculating reaction energies, and determining the lowest adsorption energy on
a catalytic surface. Although Density Functional Theory (DFT) can effectively
calculate relative values through systematic error cancellation, the accuracy
of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in this regard remains uncertain. To
investigate this issue, we analyzed approximately 483 million pairs of energy
differences predicted by DFT and GNNs using the Open Catalyst 2020 - Dense
dataset. Our analysis revealed that GNNs exhibit a correlated error that can be
reduced through subtraction, thereby challenging the naive independent error
assumption in GNN predictions and leading to more precise energy difference
predictions. To assess the magnitude of error cancellation in chemically
similar pairs, we introduced a new metric, the subgroup error cancellation
ratio (SECR). Our findings suggest that state-of-the-art GNN models can achieve
error reduction up to 77% in these subgroups, comparable to the level of error
cancellation observed with DFT. This significant error cancellation allows GNNs
to achieve higher accuracy than individual adsorption energy predictions, which
can otherwise suffer from amplified error due to random error propagation.

Recognition (ATR) models. This work specifically tackles the few-shot SAR ATR
problem, where only a handful of labeled samples may be available to support
the task of interest. Our approach is composed of two stages. In the first, a
global representation model is trained via self-supervised learning on a large
pool of diverse and unlabeled SAR data. In the second stage, the global model
is used as a fixed feature extractor and a classifier is trained to partition
the feature space given the few-shot support samples, while simultaneously
being calibrated to detect anomalous inputs. Unlike competing approaches which
require a pristine labeled dataset for pretraining via meta-learning, our
approach learns highly transferable features from unlabeled data that have
little-to-no relation to the downstream task. We evaluate our method in
standard and extended MSTAR operating conditions and find it to achieve high
accuracy and robust out-of-distribution detection in many different few-shot

of a global model approach to SAR ATR, which makes minimal assumptions, and
provides many axes for extendability.

sophisticated techniques to address the issue, with one critical component
being the selection of clean and noisy label samples. Selecting noisy label
samples is commonly based on the small-loss hypothesis or on feature-based
sampling, but we present empirical evidence that shows that both strategies
struggle to differentiate between noisy label and hard samples, resulting in
relatively large proportions of samples falsely selected as clean. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel peer-agreement based sample selection
(PASS). An automated thresholding technique is then applied to the agreement
score to select clean and noisy label samples. PASS is designed to be easily
integrated into existing noisy label robust frameworks, and it involves
training a set of classifiers in a round-robin fashion, with peer models used
for sample selection. In the experiments, we integrate our PASS with several

$E_{\gamma,\rm iso} \sim 10^{55}$ ergs. This study aims to assess its
compatibility with known GRB energy and luminosity distributions. Our analysis
indicates that the energy/luminosity function of GRBs is consistent across
various redshift intervals, and that the inclusion of GRB 221009A does not
significantly impact the function at low redshifts. Additionally, our
evaluation of the best-fitting result of the entire GRB sample suggests that
the expected number of GRBs with energy greater than $10^{55}$ ergs at a low
redshift is 0.2, so that the emergence of GRB 221009A is consistent with
expected energy/luminosity functions within $\sim 2\sigma$ Poisson fluctuation
error, still adhering to the principles of small number statistics.
Furthermore, we find that GRB 221009A and other energetic bursts, defined as
$E_{\gamma,\rm iso} \gtrsim10^{54} {\rm ergs}$, exhibit no significant

other long GRBs likely have similar progenitor systems and undergo similar
energy dissipation and radiation processes. The generation of energetic GRBs
may be due to more extreme central engine properties or, more likely, a rarer

mechanical and thermal stabilities. The predicted piezoelectric strain
coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ (absolute values) are higher than ones of

application. To obtain spontaneous valley polarization, charge doping are
explored to tune the direction of magnetization of ScXY. By appropriate hole
doping, their easy magnetization axis can change from in-plane to out-of-plane,

move in a straight line. These findings could pave the way for designing

emergence of high-dimensional data with structural breaks, there has been a
recent surge of interest in developing methods to accommodate
high-dimensionality. In practice, when the dimension is less than the sample
size but is not small, it is often unclear whether a method that is tailored to
high-dimensional data or simply a classical method that is developed and
justified for low-dimensional data is preferred. In addition, the methods
designed for low-dimensional data may not work well in the high-dimensional
environment and vice versa. This naturally brings up the question of whether
there is a change point test that can work for data of low, medium, and high
dimensions.
  In this paper, we first propose a dimension-agnostic testing procedure
targeting a single change point in the mean of multivariate time series. Our
new test is inspired by the recent work of arXiv:2011.05068, who formally
developed the notion of ``dimension-agnostic"" in several testing problems for
iid data. We develop a new test statistic by adopting their sample splitting
and projection ideas, and combining it with the self-normalization method for
time series. Using a novel conditioning argument, we are able to show that the
limiting null distribution for our test statistic is the same regardless of the
dimensionality and the magnitude of cross-sectional dependence. The power
analysis is also conducted to understand the large sample behavior of the
proposed test. Furthermore, we present an extension to test for multiple change
points in the mean and derive the limiting distributions of the new test
statistic under both the null and alternatives. Through Monte Carlo
simulations, we show that the finite sample results strongly corroborate the
theory and suggest that the proposed tests can be used as a benchmark for many

true scaling and influence the determination of the sampling angle with respect
to the local background magnetic field. Here, to investigate the scaling
anisotropy, we utilize an easy but effective criterion $\phi<10^\circ$ to
ensure the time stationarity of the magnetic field, where $\phi$ is the angle
between the two averaged magnetic fields after cutting the interval into two
halves. We study the scaling anisotropy using higher-order statistics of
structure functions under the condition of stationarity for the near-Sun solar
wind turbulence for the first time based on measurements obtained from Parker

The multifractal scaling of magnetic-trace structure functions becomes
monoscaling close to $\xi(p)=p/3$ with the local magnetic field perpendicular
to the sampling direction and close to $\xi(p)=p/4$ with the local magnetic
field parallel to the sampling direction when measured with the stationary

capital. This article formalises the theoretical foundation of cost of capital
estimation for regulatory purposes. Several common regulatory practices lack a
solid foundation in the theory. For example, the common practice of estimating
a single cost of capital for the regulated firm suffers from a circularity
problem, especially in the context of a multi-year regulatory period. In
addition, the relevant cost of debt cannot be estimated using the
yield-to-maturity on a corporate bond. We suggest possible directions for
reform of cost of capital practices in regulatory proceedings.

average level along the chromosome and over time reflects the dynamic
equilibrium of opposite activities of topoisomerases, which are required to
relax mechanical stresses that are inevitably produced during DNA replication
and gene transcription. Supercoiling affects all scales of the spatio-temporal
organization of bacterial DNA, from the base pair to the large scale chromosome
conformation. Highlighted {\it in vitro} and {\it in vivo} in the 1960s and
1970s, respectively, the first physical models were proposed concomitantly in
order to predict the deformation properties of the double helix. About fifteen
years later, polymer physics models demonstrated on larger scales the
plectonemic nature and the tree-like organization of supercoiled DNA. Since
then, many works have tried to establish a better understanding of the multiple
structuring and physiological properties of bacterial DNA in thermodynamic
equilibrium and out of equilibrium. The purpose of this essay is to discuss
upcoming challenges by discussing the relevance, the predictive capacity and
the limitations of current physical models, focusing on structural properties
above the scale of the double helix. We discuss more particularly four
fundamental aspects: gene transcription, DNA replication, nucleoid formation
and the large-scale structure of chromosomes. The review being intended for
both biologists and physicists, we have tried to reduce the respective jargon

image into albedo and shade. While IID is typically solved through supervised
learning methods, it is not ideal due to the difficulty in observing ground
truth albedo and shade in general scenes. Conversely, unsupervised learning
methods are currently underperforming supervised learning methods since there
are no criteria for solving the ill-posed problems. Recently, light detection
and ranging (LiDAR) is widely used due to its ability to make highly precise
distance measurements. Thus, we have focused on the utilization of LiDAR,
especially LiDAR intensity, to address this issue. In this paper, we propose
unsupervised intrinsic image decomposition with LiDAR intensity (IID-LI). Since
the conventional unsupervised learning methods consist of image-to-image
transformations, simply inputting LiDAR intensity is not an effective approach.
Therefore, we design an intensity consistency loss that computes the error
between LiDAR intensity and gray-scaled albedo to provide a criterion for the
ill-posed problem. In addition, LiDAR intensity is difficult to handle due to
its sparsity and occlusion, hence, a LiDAR intensity densification module is
proposed. We verified the estimating quality using our own dataset, which
include RGB images, LiDAR intensity and human judged annotations. As a result,
we achieved an estimation accuracy that outperforms conventional unsupervised
learning methods. Dataset link :

density functional theory (DFT) and equation-of-motion (EOM) coupled-cluster

cavity modes. We consider two types of calculations. In the first approach
(termed ""relaxed""), we use a coherent-state-transformed Hamiltonian within the
ground- and excited-state portions of the calculations, and cavity-induced
orbital relaxation effects are included at the mean-field level. This procedure
guarantees that the energy is origin invariant in post-self-consistent-field
calculations. In the second approach (termed ""unrelaxed""), we ignore the
coherent-state transformation and the associated orbital relaxation effects. In
this case, ground-state unrelaxed QED-CC calculations pick up a modest origin
dependence but otherwise reproduce relaxed QED-CC results within the
coherent-state basis. On the other hand, a severe origin dependence manifests
in ground-state unrelaxed QED mean-field energies. For excitation energies
computed at experimentally realizable coupling strengths, relaxed and unrelaxed
QED-EOM-CC results are similar, while significant differences emerge for
unrelaxed and relaxed QED-TDDFT. First, QED-EOM-CC and relaxed QED-TDDFT both
predict that electronic states that are not resonant with the cavity mode are
nonetheless perturbed by the cavity. Unrelaxed QED-TDDFT, on the other hand,
fails to capture this effect. Second, in the limit of large coupling strengths,
relaxed QED-TDDFT tends to overestimate Rabi splittings, while unrelaxed
QED-TDDFT underestimates them, given splittings from relaxed QED-EOM-CC as a
reference, and relaxed QED-TDDFT generally does the better job of reproducing
the QED-EOM-CC results.

this data from being shared openly. While prior works have explored image
de-identification strategies based on synthetic averaging of images in other
domains (e.g. facial images), existing techniques face difficulty in preserving
both privacy and clinical utility in retinal images, as we demonstrate in our
work. We therefore introduce k-SALSA, a generative adversarial network
(GAN)-based framework for synthesizing retinal fundus images that summarize a
given private dataset while satisfying the privacy notion of k-anonymity.
k-SALSA brings together state-of-the-art techniques for training and inverting
GANs to achieve practical performance on retinal images. Furthermore, k-SALSA
leverages a new technique, called local style alignment, to generate a
synthetic average that maximizes the retention of fine-grain visual patterns in
the source images, thus improving the clinical utility of the generated images.

ultraviolet completion of second-order-derivative quantum Einstein gravity.
While it achieves renormalizability through states of negative Dirac norm, the
unitarity violation that this would entail can be postponed to Planck energies.
As we show in this paper the theory has a different problem, one that occurs at
all energy scales, namely that the Dirac norm of the vacuum of the theory is
not finite. To establish this we present a procedure for determining the norm
of the vacuum in any quantum field theory. With the Dirac norm of the vacuum of
the second-order-derivative plus fourth-order-derivative theory not being
finite, the Feynman rules that are used to establish renormalizability are not
valid, as is the assumption that the theory can be used as an effective theory
at energies well below the Planck scale. This lack of finiteness is also
manifested in the fact that the Minkowski path integral for the theory is
divergent. Because the vacuum Dirac norm is not finite, the Hamiltonian of the
theory is not Hermitian. However, it turns out to be $PT$ symmetric. And when
one continues the theory into the complex plane and uses the $PT$ symmetry
inner product, viz. the overlap of the left-eigenstate of the Hamiltonian with
its right-eigenstate, one then finds that for the vacuum this norm is both
finite and positive, the Feynman rules now are valid, the Minkowski path
integral now is well behaved, and the theory now can serve as a low energy
effective theory. Consequently, the theory can now be offered as a fully
consistent, unitary and renormalizable theory of quantum gravity.

become a promising solution. However, most RL-based methods focus solely on
optimization within simulators and give little thought to deployment issues in
the real world. Online RL-based methods, which require interaction with the
environment, are limited in their interactions with the real-world environment.
Additionally, acquiring an offline dataset for offline RL is challenging in the
real world. Moreover, most real-world intersections prefer a cyclical phase
structure. To address these challenges, we propose: (1) a cyclical offline
dataset (COD), designed based on common real-world scenarios to facilitate easy
collection; (2) an offline RL model called DataLight, capable of learning
satisfactory control strategies from the COD; and (3) a method called Arbitrary
To Cyclical (ATC), which can transform most RL-based methods into cyclical
signal control. Extensive experiments using real-world datasets on simulators
demonstrate that: (1) DataLight outperforms most existing methods and achieves
comparable results with the best-performing method; (2) introducing ATC into
some recent RL-based methods achieves satisfactory performance; and (3) COD is
reliable, with DataLight remaining robust even with a small amount of data.
These results suggest that the cyclical offline dataset might be enough for
offline RL for TSC. Our proposed methods make significant contributions to the
TSC field and successfully bridge the gap between simulation experiments and
real-world applications. Our code is released on Github.

preservation in model-free and continuous action space domains. In
reinforcement learning, the reward function defines the agent's objective. In
adversarial scenarios, an agent may need to both maximise rewards and keep its
reward function private from observers. Recent research presented the ambiguity
model (AM), which selects actions that are ambiguous over a set of possible
reward functions, via pre-trained $Q$-functions. Despite promising results in
model-based domains, our investigation shows that AM is ineffective in
model-free domains due to misdirected state space exploration. It is also
inefficient to train and inapplicable in continuous action space domains. We
propose the deceptive exploration ambiguity model (DEAM), which learns using
the deceptive policy during training, leading to targeted exploration of the
state space. DEAM is also applicable in continuous action spaces. We evaluate
DEAM in discrete and continuous action space path planning environments. DEAM
achieves similar performance to an optimal model-based version of AM and
outperforms a model-free version of AM in terms of path cost, deceptiveness and
training efficiency. These results extend to the continuous domain.

distributed roughness elements is studied using direct numerical simulation
(DNS) and global stability analysis, and compared to isolated roughness
elements at the same Reh. Small spanwise spacing ($\lambda_z = 2.5h$) inhibits
the formation of counter-rotating vortices (CVP) and as a result, hairpin
vortices are not generated and the downstream shear layer is steady. For
$\lambda_z = 5h$, the CVP and hairpin vortices are induced by the first row of
roughness, perturbing the downstream shear layer and causing transition. The
temporal periodicity of the primary hairpin vortices appears to be independent
of the streamwise spacing. Distributed roughness leads to a lower critical Reh
for instability to occur and a more significant breakdown of the boundary layer
compared to isolated roughness. When the streamwise spacing is comparable to
the region of flow separation ($\lambda_x = 5h$), the high-momentum fluid
barely moves downward into the cavities and the wake flow has little impact on
the following roughness elements. The leading unstable varicose mode is
associated with the central low-speed streaks along the aligned roughness
elements, and its frequency is close to the shedding frequency of hairpin
vortices in the isolated case. For larger streamwise spacing ($\lambda_x =
10h$), two distinct modes are obtained from global stability analysis. The
first mode shows varicose symmetry, corresponding to the primary hairpin vortex
shedding induced by the first-row roughness. The high-speed streaks formed in
the longitudinal grooves are also found to be unstable and interacting with the
varicose mode. The second mode is a sinuous mode with lower frequency, induced
as the wake flow of the first-row roughness runs into the second row. It
extracts most energy from the spanwise shear between the high- and low-speed

adaptation. Test-time training (TTT) emerges as a solution to this adaptation
under a realistic scenario where access to full source domain data is not
available, and instant inference on the target domain is required. Despite many
efforts into TTT, there is a confusion over the experimental settings, thus
leading to unfair comparisons. In this work, we first revisit TTT assumptions
and categorize TTT protocols by two key factors. Among the multiple protocols,
we adopt a realistic sequential test-time training (sTTT) protocol, under which
we develop a test-time anchored clustering (TTAC) approach to enable stronger
test-time feature learning. TTAC discovers clusters in both source and target
domains and matches the target clusters to the source ones to improve
adaptation. When source domain information is strictly absent (i.e.
source-free) we further develop an efficient method to infer source domain
distributions for anchored clustering. Finally, self-training~(ST) has
demonstrated great success in learning from unlabeled data and we empirically
figure out that applying ST alone to TTT is prone to confirmation bias.
Therefore, a more effective TTT approach is introduced by regularizing
self-training with anchored clustering, and the improved model is referred to
as TTAC++. We demonstrate that, under all TTT protocols, TTAC++ consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on five TTT datasets, including
corrupted target domain, selected hard samples, synthetic-to-real adaptation
and adversarially attacked target domain. We hope this work will provide a fair
benchmarking of TTT methods, and future research should be compared within

and held by self-interested agents. Decision markets are well-suited mechanisms
to elicit such information and aggregate it into conditional forecasts that can
be used for decision-making. However, for incentive-compatible elicitation,
decision markets rely on stochastic decision rules which entails that sometimes
actions have to be taken that have been predicted to be sub-optimal. In this
work, we propose three closely related mechanisms that elicit and aggregate
information similar to a decision market, but are incentive compatible despite
using a deterministic decision rule. Following ideas from peer prediction
mechanisms, proxies rather than observed future outcomes are used to score
predictions. The first mechanism requires the principal to have her own signal,
which is then used as a proxy to elicit information from a group of
self-interested agents. The principal then deterministically maps the
aggregated forecasts and the proxy to the best possible decision. The second
and third mechanisms expand the first to cover a scenario where the principal
does not have access to her own signal. The principal offers a partial profit
to align the interest of one agent and retrieve its signal as a proxy; or
alternatively uses a proper peer prediction mechanism to elicit signals from
two agents. Aggregation and decision-making then follow the first mechanism. We
evaluate our first mechanism using a multi-agent bandit learning system. The
result suggests that the mechanism can train agents to achieve a performance

fundamental material limitations. Here we present a Metasurface-based
Full-Stokes Polarimetric Imaging sensor (MetaPolarIm) realized by integrating
an ultrathin (~600 nm) metasurface polarization filter array (MPFA) onto a
visible imaging sensor with CMOS compatible fabrication processes. The MPFA is
featured with broadband dielectric-metal hybrid chiral metasurfaces and
double-layer nanograting polarizers. This chip-integrated polarimetric imaging
sensor enables single-shot full-Stokes imaging (speed limited by the CMOS
imager) with the most compact form factor, record high measurement accuracy,
dual-color operation (green and red) and a full angle of view up to 40 degrees.
MetaPolarIm holds great promise to enable transformative applications in
autonomous vision, industry inspection, space exploration, medical imaging and
diagnosis.

first without any reward information, in order to achieve certain learning
goals afterwards for any given reward. In this paper we focus on reward-free RL
under low-rank MDP models, in which both the representation and linear weight
vectors are unknown. Although various algorithms have been proposed for
reward-free low-rank MDPs, the corresponding sample complexity is still far
from being satisfactory. In this work, we first provide the first known sample
complexity lower bound that holds for any algorithm under low-rank MDPs. This
lower bound implies it is strictly harder to find a near-optimal policy under
low-rank MDPs than under linear MDPs. We then propose a novel model-based
algorithm, coined RAFFLE, and show it can both find an $\epsilon$-optimal
policy and achieve an $\epsilon$-accurate system identification via reward-free
exploration, with a sample complexity significantly improving the previous
results. Such a sample complexity matches our lower bound in the dependence on
$\epsilon$, as well as on $K$ in the large $d$ regime, where $d$ and $K$
respectively denote the representation dimension and action space cardinality.
Finally, we provide a planning algorithm (without further interaction with true

first known representation learning guarantee under the same setting.

coherent error since each unitary gate suffers from the discretized coherent
error due to fault-tolerant implementation. A recently proposed approach called
probabilistic state synthesis, where the circuit is probabilistically sampled
to turn such coherent errors into incoherent ones, is able to reduce the order
of the approximation error compared to conventional deterministic synthesis. In
this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis
quadratically reduces the approximation error with respect to the trace
distance. We also show that a deterministic synthesis algorithm can be
efficiently converted into a probabilistic one to achieve quadratic error
reduction. To estimate how the error reduction reduces the circuit size, we
show that probabilistic encoding asymptotically halves the length of the
classical bit string, which provides a general lower bound on the circuit size,
required to approximately encode a pure state. To derive these results, we
prove general theorems about the optimal convex approximation of a quantum
state by using a restricted subset of quantum states. As another application of
our theorem, we provide exact formulas for the minimum trace distance between
an entangled state and the set of separable states and alternate proof about a

custom low radioactivity cables for use in rare-event physics applications. A
methodical step-by-step approach was developed and informed by ultrasensitive
assay to determine the radiopurity in the starting materials and identify the

annotations to learn new predicate types. Thus, it is difficult to apply them
to real-world applications with a long-tailed distribution of predicates. In
this paper, we focus on a new promising task of SGG: few-shot SGG (FSSGG).
FSSGG encourages models to be able to quickly transfer previous knowledge and
recognize novel predicates well with only a few examples. Although many
advanced approaches have achieved great success on few-shot learning (FSL)
tasks, straightforwardly extending them into FSSGG is not applicable due to two
intrinsic characteristics of predicate concepts: 1) Each predicate category
commonly has multiple semantic meanings under different contexts. 2) The visual
appearance of relation triplets with the same predicate differs greatly under
different subject-object pairs. Both issues make it hard to model conventional
latent representations for predicate categories with state-of-the-art FSL
methods. To this end, we propose a novel Decomposed Prototype Learning (DPL).
Specifically, we first construct a decomposable prototype space to capture
intrinsic visual patterns of subjects and objects for predicates, and enhance
their feature representations with these decomposed prototypes. Then, we devise
an intelligent metric learner to assign adaptive weights to each support sample
by considering the relevance of their subject-object pairs. We further re-split
the VG dataset and compare DPL with various FSL methods to benchmark this task.
Extensive results show that DPL achieves excellent performance in both base and
novel categories.

end-effector position controller and a gripper width controller concurrently in
a closed loop. The position controller maintains a desired force using vision
and wrist force. The gripper controller uses tactile sensing to keep the grip
firm enough to prevent translational slip, but loose enough to induce
rotational slip. Our sensor-based control approach relies on matching a desired
force profile derived from object dimensions and weight and vision-based
monitoring of the object pose. The gripper controller uses tactile sensors to
detect and prevent translational slip by tightening the grip when needed.
Experimental results where the robot was tasked with rotating cuboid objects 90
degrees show that the multi-modal pivoting approach was able to rotate the
objects without causing lift or slip, and was more energy-efficient compared to
using a single sensor modality and to pick-and-place. While our work
demonstrated the benefit of multi-modal sensing for the pivoting task, further
work is needed to generalize our approach to any given object.

destination node as timely as possible with the aid of a relay node. For
time-slotted systems without relaying, prior works have shown that the source
should generate and send a new packet to the destination every time slot to
minimize the average AoI, regardless of whether the destination has
successfully decoded the packet in the previous slot. However, when a dedicated
relay is involved, whether the relay can improve the AoI performance requires
an in-depth study. In particular, the packet generation and transmission
strategy of the source should be carefully designed to cooperate with the
relay. Depending on whether the source and the relay are allowed to transmit
simultaneously, two relay-assisted schemes are investigated: time division
multiple access (TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes. A key
challenge in deriving their theoretical average AoI is that the destination has
different probabilities of successfully receiving an update packet in different
time slots. We model each scheme using a Markov chain to derive the
corresponding closed-form average AoI. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis
indicates that the relay-assisted schemes can only outperform the non-relay
scheme in average AoI when the signal-to-noise ratio of the source-destination
link is below -2dB. Furthermore, comparing the merits of relay-assisted
schemes, simulation results show that the TDMA scheme has a lower energy

according to the depletion radii of haloes. Unlike conventional models that
define haloes with the virial radius while relying on a separate exclusion
radius or ad-hoc fixes to account for halo exclusion, our model distributes
mass across all scales self-consistently. Using a cosmological simulation, we
show that our halo definition leads to very simple and intuitive model
components, with the one-halo term given by the Einasto profile with no
truncation needed, and the halo-halo correlation function following a universal
power-law form down to the halo boundary. The universal halo-halo correlation
also allows us to easily model the distribution of unresolved haloes as well as
diffuse matter. Convolving the halo profile with the halo-halo correlation
function, we obtain a complete description of the halo-matter correlation
across all scales, which self-consistently accounts for halo exclusion on the
transition scale. Mass conservation is explicitly maintained in our model, and
the scale dependence of the classical halo bias is easily reproduced. Our model
can successfully reconstruct the halo-matter correlation function with percent
level accuracy for halo virial masses in the range of $10^{11.5}h^{-1}{\rm

two. This evolution process is also observed via the formation of a trough in
the bias profile, with the two depletion radii identifying key scales in the
evolution. The ratio between the inner depletion radius and the virial radius
is approximately a constant factor of 2 across redshifts and halo masses. The
ratio between their enclosed densities is also close to a constant of 0.18.
These simple scaling relations reflect the largely universal scaled mass
profile on these scales, which only evolves weakly with redshift. The overall
picture of the boundary evolution can be broadly divided into three stages
according to the maturity of the depletion process, with cluster halos lagging
behind low mass ones in the evolution. We also show that the traditional slow
and fast accretion dichotomy of halo growth can be identified as accelerated
and decelerated depletion phases respectively.

compute general types of the isotropy-violating 2PCFs by generalizing the
polypolar spherical harmonic decomposition approach to the spin-weighted

spectrum has a well-known $g_*$-type isotropy-breaking term (induced by, e.g.,
dark vector fields). We then confirm that some anisotropic distortions indeed
appear in the 2PCFs and their shapes rely on a preferred direction causing the
isotropy violation, $\hat{d}$. Such a feature can be a distinctive indicator
for testing the cosmic isotropy. Comparing the isotropy-violating 2PCFs
computed with and without the plane parallel (PP) approximation, we find that,
depending on $\hat{d}$, the PP approximation is no longer valid when an opening
angle between the directions towards target galaxies is ${\cal O}(1^\circ)$ for
the density-ellipticity and velocity-ellipticity cross correlations and around
$10^\circ$ for the ellipticity auto correlation. This suggests that an accurate

features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of lesions. To
address this challenge, we propose a general multi-scale in multi-scale

the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Next, we expand the
single-scale SU to the intra-layer multi-scale SU, which can provide the
decoder with both pixel-level and structure-level difference information. Then,
we pyramidally equip the multi-scale SUs at different levels with varying
receptive fields, thereby achieving the inter-layer multi-scale feature
aggregation and obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition,
we build a training-free network ``LossNet'' to comprehensively supervise the
task-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives our

their capacities to imitate the intrinsic 3D perception ability of humans. In
this paper, we propose an Inverse Graphics Capsule Network (IGC-Net) to learn
the hierarchical 3D face representations from large-scale unlabeled images. The
core of IGC-Net is a new type of capsule, named graphics capsule, which
represents 3D primitives with interpretable parameters in computer graphics

decomposes the objects into a set of semantic-consistent part-level
descriptions and then assembles them into object-level descriptions to build
the hierarchy. The learned graphics capsules reveal how the neural networks,
oriented at visual perception, understand faces as a hierarchy of 3D models.
Besides, the discovered parts can be deployed to the unsupervised face
segmentation task to evaluate the semantic consistency of our method. Moreover,
the part-level descriptions with explicit physical meanings provide insight

seldom paid proper attention to. This work reveals that aliovalent doping can
be much more effective in reducing the lattice thermal conductivity of
thermoelectric semiconductors than the commonly employed isoelectronic alloying
strategy. As demonstrated in the heavy-band NbFeSb system, a large reduction of
65% in the lattice thermal conductivity is achieved through only 10% aliovalent
Hf-doping, compared to the 4 times higher isoelectronic Ta-alloying. It is
elucidated that aliovalent doping introduces free charge carriers and enhances
the screening, leading to the giant softening and deceleration of optical
phonons. Moreover, the heavy dopant can induce the avoided-crossing of acoustic

results highlight the significant role of aliovalent dopants in regulating the

within a short time. E2C is a discrete event simulator that offers the
following features: (i) simulating a heterogeneous computing system; (ii)
implementing a newly developed scheduling method and plugging it into the
system, (iii) measuring energy consumption and other output-related metrics;
and (iv) powerful visual aspects to ease the learning curve for students. We

uncertainty quantification can be formulated as stochastic fractional partial
differential equations (SFPDEs). There are many challenges in solving SFPDEs
numerically, especially for long-time integration since such problems are
high-dimensional and nonlocal. Here, we combine the bi-orthogonal (BO) method
for representing stochastic processes with physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for solving partial differential equations to formulate the
bi-orthogonal PINN method (BO-fPINN) for solving time-dependent SFPDEs.
Specifically, we introduce a deep neural network for the stochastic solution of
the time-dependent SFPDEs, and include the BO constraints in the loss function
following a weak formulation. Since automatic differentiation is not currently
applicable to fractional derivatives, we employ discretization on a grid to to
compute the fractional derivatives of the neural network output. The weak
formulation loss function of the BO-fPINN method can overcome some drawbacks of
the BO methods and thus can be used to solve SFPDEs with eigenvalue crossings.
Moreover, the BO-fPINN method can be used for inverse SFPDEs with the same
framework and same computational complexity as for forward problems. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the BO-fPINN method for different benchmark
problems. The results demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the
proposed method, especially for inverse problems.

achieved state-of-the-art performance in many tasks including automatic speech
recognition (ASR), knowledge distillation (KD) is often required in practice to
transfer the knowledge learned by large teacher models into much smaller
student models with affordable computation and memory costs. This paper
proposes a novel two-stage KD framework to distil the knowledge from multiple
speech foundation models as teachers into a single student neural transducer
model for ASR. In the first stage, the student model encoder is pre-trained
using the embeddings extracted from multiple teacher models. In the second
stage, the student encoder is fine-tuned with the audio-text pairs based on the
ASR task. Experiments on the LibriSpeech 100-hour subset show that the proposed
KD framework improves the performance of both streaming and non-streaming
student models when using only one teacher. The performance of the student
model can be further enhanced when multiple teachers are used jointly,
achieving word error rate reductions (WERRs) of 17.5% and 10.6%. Our proposed
framework can be combined with other existing KD methods to achieve further
improvements. Further WERRs were obtained by incorporating extra unlabelled
data during encoder pre-training, leading to a total relative WERR of 55.0% on
the non-streaming student model.

sparse sketch of all $k$-mers with nice theoretical properties, and therefore
admits critical applications in clustering, indexing, hashing, and sketching
large-scale sequencing data, particularly those with high error-rates. Finding
an MIS is a challenging problem, as the size of a $k$-mer space grows
geometrically with respect to $k$. We propose three algorithms for this

second method implements two techniques to avoid redundant comparisons by
taking advantage of the locality-property of the $k$-mer space and the
estimated bounds on the edit distance. The last algorithm avoids expensive

the lineshape analysis of the absorption spectra within a photophysical
aggregate model reveals a gradual increase in interchain excitonic coupling. We
also observe a red-shifted and line-narrowed steady-state photoluminescence
spectrum, along with increasing resonance Raman intensity in the stretching and
torsional modes of the dithienothiphene unit, which suggests a longer exciton
coherence length along the polymer-chain backbone. Furthermore, we observe a
change of lineshape in the photoinduced absorption component of the transient
absorption spectrum. The derivative-like lineshape may originate from two
possibilities: a new excited-state absorption, or from optical Stark effect,
both of which are consistent with the emergence of high-energy shoulder as seen
in both photoluminescence and absorption spectra. Therefore, we conclude that
the exciton is more dispersed along the polymer chain backbone with increasing
concentrations, leading to the hypothesis that the polymer chain order is
enhanced when the push-pull polymers are processed at higher concentrations.
Thus, tuning the microscopic chain conformation by concentration would be
another factor of interest when considering the polymer assembly pathways for

apply the methodology to test what is meaningful in the communication system of
sperm whales, one of the most intriguing and understudied animal communication
systems. We train a network that has been shown to learn meaningful
representations of speech and test whether we can leverage such unsupervised
learning to decipher the properties of another vocal communication system for
which we have no ground truth. The proposed technique suggests that sperm
whales encode information using the number of clicks in a sequence, the
regularity of their timing, and audio properties such as the spectral mean and
the acoustic regularity of the sequences. Some of these findings are consistent
with existing hypotheses, while others are proposed for the first time. We also
argue that our models uncover rules that govern the structure of communication
units in the sperm whale communication system and apply them while generating
innovative data not shown during training. This paper suggests that an
interpretation of the outputs of deep neural networks with causal methodology

Similar topological robustness is desirable in enantio-sensitive detection but

a hybrid between the vortex beam and synthetic chiral light, which interacts
with chiral molecules extremely efficiently due to the electric dipole nature
of this interaction. An integer topological charge is encoded in the azymuthal
evolution of light's handedness. The topological protection arises due to
mapping of topological charge into the intensity of the far-field profile of
non-linear optical response, where enantio-sensitivity arises as its spatial
rotation. The intensity maxima are robust against noise and enable detection of
percent level enantiomeric excesses in mixtures as we demonstrate numerically
for randomly oriented fenchone molecules. Next we show that using the
topological charge as a parameter one can reconstruct the chiral and achiral
components of non-linear response. Our work opens a way to the new extremely

in developing quantum algorithms. For example, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
demonstrated exponential quantum advantages over classical deterministic
algorithms. As an important complexity measure, exact quantum query complexity
describes the minimum number of queries required to solve a specific problem
exactly using a quantum algorithm.
  In this paper, we consider the exact quantum query complexity of the
following two $n$-bit symmetric functions $\text{MOD}_m^n:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow
\{0,...,m-1\}$ and $\text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, which

results are as follows: i) We present an optimal quantum algorithm for
computing $\text{MOD}_m^n$, achieving a query complexity of $\lceil
n(1-\frac{1}{m}) \rceil$ for $1 < m \le n$. This settles a conjecture proposed
by Cornelissen, Mande, Ozols and de Wolf (2021). Based on this algorithm, we
show the exact quantum query complexity of a broad class of symmetric functions
that map $\{0,1\}^n$ to a finite set $X$ is less than $n$. ii) When $l-k \ge
2$, we give an optimal exact quantum query algorithm to compute
$\text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n$ for the case $k=0$ or $k=1,l=n-1$. This resolves the

static perception methods trained on pre-collected images, the embodied agent
can move around in the environment and obtain images of objects from any

collection method to gather informative training samples is the key to this
task. To do this, we first build a 3D semantic distribution map to train the
exploration policy self-supervised by introducing the semantic distribution
disagreement and the semantic distribution uncertainty rewards. Note that the
map is generated from multi-view observations and can weaken the impact of
misidentification from an unfamiliar viewpoint. Our agent is then encouraged to
explore the objects with different semantic distributions across viewpoints, or
uncertain semantic distributions. With the explored informative trajectories,
we propose to select hard samples on trajectories based on the semantic

$T_c$ of two-dimensional (2D) superconductors and superfluids versus particle
density $n$ or filling factor $\nu$ for continuum and lattice systems from the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose regime. We discuss only one-band
Hamiltonians, where the transition from the normal to superconducting
(superfluid) phase is governed by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)
mechanism of vortex-antivortex binding, such that a direct relation between the
superfluid density tensor and $T_c$ exists. We demonstrate that it is
imperative to consider at least the full effect of phase fluctuations of order
parameter for superconductivity (superfluidity) to establish tighter bounds.
Using the renormalization group, we obtain phase-fluctuation critical
temperature $T_c^{\theta}$, a much tighter upper bound to critical temperature
supremum $T_c^{\rm sup}$ than standard critical temperature upper bound
$T_c^{\rm up1}$ from Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule. We go beyond textbook
phase-fluctuation theories and show that chemical potential renormalization,
order parameter equation, and Nelson-Kosterlitz relation need to be solved
self-consistently and simultaneously with renormalization group flow equation
to produce $T_c^{\theta}$ over the entire BCS-Bose crossover. We note that an
analytic theory including modulus fluctuations of the order parameter valid
throughout the BCS-Bose evolution is still lacking, but the inclusion of
modulus fluctuations can only produce a critical temperature lower than
$T_c^{\theta}$ and thus produce an even tighter bound to $T_c^{\rm sup}$. We
conclude by indicating that if the measured critical temperature exceeds
$T_c^{\theta}$ in experiments involving 2D single-band systems, then a non-BKT
mechanism must be invoked to describe the superconducting (superfluid)

relativistic scattering of a massive (neutral) lepton on a nucleus, in which
the latter retains its integrity. The measurable cross section of this process
includes the elastic (or coherent) contribution, when the nucleus remains in
its original quantum state and the inelastic (incoherent) contribution, when
the nucleus goes into another (excited) quantum state. Transition from the
elastic scattering regime to the inelastic scattering regime is regulated
automatically by the dependence of the form factors on the momentum transferred
to the nucleus. At small momentum transfers elastic scattering dominates. AS
the transferred momentum increases, the contribution of the inelastic
scattering increases, and the latter becomes dominant at sufficiently large
transferred momenta. The scattering of massive (anti)neutrinos interacting with
nucleons through the $V\mp A$ currents of the Standard Model is considered in
detail. Because of the nonzero masses, an additional channel arises for elastic
and inelastic scattering of these (anti)neutrinos on nuclei due to the
possibility of changing the helicity of these (anti)neutrinos. The expressions
obtained for the cross sections are applicable to any precision data analysis
involving neutrinos and antineutrinos, especially when non-zero neutrino masses
can be taken into account. These expressions can also be used in the analysis
of experiments on direct detection of (neutral) massive weakly interacting
relativistic dark matter particles since, unlike the generally accepted case,
they simultaneously take into account both elastic and inelastic interactions
of the particles. The presence of an ""inelastic signal"" with its characteristic
signature may be the only registrable evidence of interaction of the dark

methods implicitly make an assumption that all test distributions have a
unified signal that can be learned directly. In open-world conditions, the pose
transfer task raises various independent signals: OOD appearance and skeleton,
which need to be extracted and distributed in speciality. To address this
point, we develop a SEquential Test-time Adaption (SETA). In the test-time
phrase, SETA extracts and distributes external appearance texture by augmenting
OOD data for self-supervised training. To make non-Euclidean similarity among
different postures explicit, SETA uses the image representations derived from a

addressing implicit posture representation in the test-time sequentially, SETA

gravity theories. Recently, it is found that the massless entanglement island
appears in wedge holography with DGP gravity on the branes. In this paper, we
generalize the discussions to the codim-n holography named cone holography. For
simplicity, we focus on the case with a codim-2 E brane and a codim-1 Q brane.
We discuss the effective action, mass spectrum and holographic entanglement
entropy for cone holography with DGP terms. We verify that there is massless
gravity on the branes, and recover non-trivial entanglement islands and Page
curves. Besides, we work out the parameter space which allows entanglement
islands and Page curves. Compared with wedge holography, there are several new
features. First, one can not add DGP gravity on the codim-2 E brane. That is
because the energy density has to be a constant on codim-2 branes for Einstein
gravity in bulk. Second, the Hartman-Maldacena surface ends only on the codim-1
Q brane. Third, the Hartman-Maldacena surface can be defined only in a finite
time. We notice that this unusual situation also appears in AdS/dCFT and even
in AdS/CFT. Fortunately, it does not affect the Page curve since it happens
after Page time. Our results provide more support that the entanglement island
is consistent with massless gravity theories.

direction information of light rays. It naturally enables a
six-degrees-of-freedom viewing experience and deep user engagement in virtual
reality. Compared to 2D image assessment, light field image quality assessment
(LFIQA) needs to consider not only the image quality in the spatial domain but
also the quality consistency in the angular domain. However, there is a lack of
metrics to effectively reflect the angular consistency and thus the angular
quality of a light field image (LFI). Furthermore, the existing LFIQA metrics
suffer from high computational costs due to the excessive data volume of LFIs.
In this paper, we propose a novel concept of ""anglewise attention"" by
introducing a multihead self-attention mechanism to the angular domain of an
LFI. This mechanism better reflects the LFI quality. In particular, we propose
three new attention kernels, including anglewise self-attention, anglewise grid
attention, and anglewise central attention. These attention kernels can realize
angular self-attention, extract multiangled features globally or selectively,
and reduce the computational cost of feature extraction. By effectively
incorporating the proposed kernels, we further propose our light field
attentional convolutional neural network (LFACon) as an LFIQA metric. Our
experimental results show that the proposed LFACon metric significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art LFIQA metrics. For the majority of distortion
types, LFACon attains the best performance with lower complexity and less

locations in the subsurface, and can, therefore, be used to isolate zones of
specific interest. This creates a new reflection response of the target zone
without interference from over- or underburden reflectors. Consequently, the
method is well suited to obtain a clear response of a subsurface reservoir,
which can be advantageous in time-lapse studies. The clean isolated responses
of a baseline and monitor survey can be more effectively compared, hence the
retrieval of time-lapse characteristics is improved. This research aims to
apply Marchenko-based isolation to a time-lapse marine dataset of the Troll
field in Norway in order to acquire an unobstructed image of the primary
reflections, and retrieve small time-lapse traveltime difference in the
reservoir. It is found that the method not only isolates the primary
reflections but can also recover internal multiples outside the recording time.
Both the primaries and the multiples can then be utilised to find time-lapse
traveltime differences. More accurate ways of time-lapse monitoring will allow
for a better understanding of dynamic processes in the subsurface, such as
observing saturation and pressure changes in a reservoir or monitoring
underground storage of hydrogen and CO2.

hinders the practicality and trustworthiness of NMT. A contributing factor to
this problem is that NMT models trained with the one-to-one paradigm struggle
to handle the source diversity phenomenon, where inputs with the same meaning

semantically equivalent sentences to the same target sentence. We conduct

Energetic Particle (SEP) event that was observed by five longitudinally
well-separated observers in the inner heliosphere at heliocentric distances of
0.42 to 1 au: BepiColombo, Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, STEREO A, and
near-Earth spacecraft. The event produced relativistic electrons and protons.
It was associated with a long-lasting solar hard X-ray flare and a medium fast
Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) with a speed of 880 km/s driving a shock, an EUV
wave as well as long-lasting radio burst activity showing four distinct type
III burst. Methods. A multi-spacecraft analysis of remote-sensing and in-situ
observations is applied to attribute the SEP observations at the different
locations to the various potential source regions at the Sun. An ENLIL
simulation is used to characterize the interplanetary state and its role for
the energetic particle transport. The magnetic connection between each
spacecraft and the Sun is determined. Based on a reconstruction of the coronal
shock front we determine the times when the shock establishes magnetic
connections with the different observers. Radio observations are used to
characterize the directivity of the four main injection episodes, which are
then employed in a 2D SEP transport simulation. Results. Timing analysis of the
inferred SEP solar injection suggests different source processes being
important for the electron and the proton event. Comparison among the
characteristics and timing of the potential particle sources, such as the
CME-driven shock or the flare, suggests a stronger shock contribution for the
proton event and a more likely flare-related source of the electron event.
Conclusions. We find that in this event an important ingredient for the wide
SEP spread was the wide longitudinal range of about 110 degrees covered by
distinct SEP injections.

their creation typically requires some form of (often manual) curation. In
turn, methods that purely rely on point clouds are unable to meet the matching
quality of mesh-based methods that utilise the additional topological

regularisation with a contrastive loss that couples mesh and point cloud data.

According to a comprehensive validation on six different OOD data sets
comprising 600 RGB and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) cubes from 33 pigs
semantically annotated with 19 classes, we demonstrate a large performance drop
of SOA organ segmentation networks applied to geometric OOD data. Surprisingly,
this holds true not only for conventional RGB data (drop of Dice similarity

latter's rich information content per pixel. Using our augmentation scheme
improves on the SOA DSC by up to 67 % (RGB) and 90 % (HSI) and renders

coupled equations relating $n$-point Green's functions in a self-consistent
manner. They have found important applications in non-perturbative studies,
ranging from quantum chromodynamics and hadron physics to strongly correlated
electron systems. However, they are notoriously formidable to solve. One of the
main problems is that a finite truncation of the infinite system is
underdetermined. Recently, Bender et al. [PRL 130, 101602 (2023)] proposed to
make use of the large-$n$ asymptotic behaviors and successfully obtained
accurate results in $D=0$ spacetime. At higher $D$, it seems more difficult to
deduce the large-$n$ behaviors. In this paper, we propose another avenue in
light of the null bootstrap. The underdetermined system is solved by imposing
the null state condition. This approach can be extended to $D>0$ more readily.
As concrete examples, we show that the cases of $D=0$ and $D=1$ indeed converge
to the exact results for several Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories of the
$g\phi^n$ type, including the complex solutions.

radiation therapy (RT), radiation from linear accelerators is used to kill
malignant tumor cells. Scheduling patients for RT is difficult both due to the
numerous medical and technical constraints, and because of the stochastic
inflow of patients with different urgency levels. In this paper, a Column
Generation (CG) approach is proposed for the RT patient scheduling problem. The
model includes all the constraints necessary for the generated schedules to
work in practice, including for example different machine compatibilities,
individualized patient protocols, and multiple hospital sites. The model is the
first to include planned interruptions in treatments due to maintenance on
machines, which is an important aspect when scheduling patients in practice, as
it can create bottlenecks in the patient flow. Different methods to ensure that
there are available resources for high priority patients at arrival are
compared, including static and dynamic time reservation. Data from Iridium
Netwerk, the largest cancer center in Belgium, is used to evaluate the CG
approach. The results show that the dynamic time reservation method outperforms
the other methods used to handle uncertainty in future urgent patients. A
sensitivity analysis also shows that the dynamic time reservation method is
robust to fluctuations in arrival rates. The CG approach produces schedules
that fulfill all the medical and technical constraints posed at Iridium Netwerk
with acceptable computation times.

Despite the tremendous implications that an ultrahigh index could have for
optical technologies, little research has been done on why the refractive index
of materials is universally small, and whether this observation is fundamental.
Here, we investigate the index of an ordered arrangement of atoms, as a
function of atomic density. At dilute densities, this problem falls into the
realm of quantum optics, where atoms do not interact with one another except
via the scattering of light. On the other hand, when the lattice constant
becomes comparable to the Bohr radius, the electronic orbitals begin to
overlap, giving rise to quantum chemistry. We present a minimal model that
allows for a unifying theory of index spanning these two regimes. A key aspect
is the treatment of multiple light scattering, which can be highly
non-perturbative over a large density range, and which is the reason that
conventional theories of the index break down. In the quantum optics regime, we
show that ideal light-matter interactions can have a single-mode nature,
allowing for a purely real refractive index that grows with density as
$(N/V)^{1/3}$. At the onset of quantum chemistry, we show how two physical
mechanisms (excited electron tunneling dynamics and the buildup of electronic
density-density correlations) can open up inelastic or spatial multi-mode light
scattering processes, which ultimately reduce the index back to order unity
while introducing absorption. Around the onset of chemistry, our theory
predicts that ultrahigh index ($n\sim 30$), low-loss materials could in
principle be allowed by the laws of nature.

is generally imposed on the weights of neural networks, reducing the footprint
of the architecture. In this work, we go one step further by imposing sparsity
jointly on the weights and on the input data. This can be achieved following a
three-step process: 1) impose a certain structured sparsity on the weights of
the network; 2) track back input features corresponding to zeroed blocks of
weight; 3) remove useless weights and input features and retrain the network.
Performing pruning both on the network and on input data not only allows for
extreme reduction in terms of parameters and operations but can also serve as
an interpretation process. Indeed, with the help of data pruning, we now have
information about which input feature is useful for the network to keep its
performance. Experiments conducted on a variety of architectures and datasets:
MLP validated on MNIST, CIFAR10/100 and ConvNets (VGG16 and ResNet18),
validated on CIFAR10/100 and CALTECH101 respectively, show that it is possible
to achieve additional gains in terms of total parameters and in FLOPs by
performing pruning on input data, while also increasing accuracy.

that has been suggested is that upflows at the edge of an active region can
contribute to the slow solar wind.
  We aim to explain how the plasma upflows are generated, which mechanisms are
responsible for them, and what the upflow region topology looks like.
  We investigated an upflow region using imaging data with the unprecedented
temporal (3s) and spatial (2 pixels = 236km) resolution that were obtained on
30 March 2022 with the 174{\AA} of the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High
Resolution Imager (HRI) on board Solar Orbiter. During this time, the EUI and
Earth-orbiting satellites (Solar Dynamics Observatory, Hinode, and the
Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, IRIS) were located in quadrature (92
degrees), which provides a stereoscopic view with high resolution. We used the
Hinode/EIS (Fe XII) spectroscopic data to find coronal upflow regions in the
active region. The IRIS slit-jaw imager provides a high-resolution view of the
transition region and chromosphere.
  For the first time, we have data that provide a quadrature view of a coronal
upflow region with high spatial resolution. We found extended loops rooted in a
coronal upflow region. Plasma upflows at the footpoints of extended loops
determined spectroscopically through the Doppler shift are similar to the
apparent upward motions seen through imaging in quadrature. The dynamics of
small-scale structures in the upflow region can be used to identify two
mechanisms of the plasma upflow: Mechanism I is reconnection of the hot coronal
loops with open magnetic field lines in the solar corona, and mechanism II is
reconnection of the small chromospheric loops with open magnetic field lines in
the chromosphere or transition region. We identified the locations in which
mechanisms I and II work.

Cantor showing that infinite sets follow their own seemingly paradoxical
mathematical rules. In 1924, David Hilbert highlighted the strangeness of
infinity through a thought experiment now referred to as the Hilbert Hotel
paradox, or simply Hilbert's Hotel. The paradox describes an ""fully"" occupied
imaginary hotel having infinite number of single-occupancy rooms, the manager
can always find a room for new guest by simply shifting current guests to the
next highest room, leaving first room vacant. The investigation of wavefield
singularities has uncovered the existence of a direct optical analogy to
Hilbert's thought experiment. Since then, efforts have been made to investigate
the properties of Hilbert's Hotel by controlling the dynamics of phase
singularities in``fractional'' order optical vortex beams. Here, we have taken
such proposals to the next level and experimentally demonstrated Hilbert's
Hotel using both phase and polarization singularities of optical fields. Using
a multi-ramped spiral-phase-plate and a supercontinuum source, we generated and
controlled fractional order vortex beams for the practical implementation of
Hilbert's Hotel in scalar and vector vortex beams. Using a multi-ramped

usefulness of structured beams in visualizing unusual mathematical concepts and
also for fractional vector beams driven fundamental and applied research.

lines of constant renormalized mass, and therefore to substantially improve the
continuum extrapolation of the mass gap and the electric field density. For
small values of the mass, our continuum results agree with the theoretical

recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an alternative
solution to reduce the annotation overheads in WSIs, as it does not require

handling multi-resolution WSIs, which limits their performance in learning
discriminative image features. In this paper, we propose a Dual-branch SSL
Framework for WSI tumour segmentation (DSF-WSI) that can effectively learn
image features from multi-resolution WSIs. Our DSF-WSI connected two branches
and jointly learnt low and high resolution WSIs in a self-supervised manner.
Moreover, we introduced a novel Context-Target Fusion Module (CTFM) and a

Furthermore, we designed a Dense SimSiam Learning (DSL) strategy to maximise
the similarity of different views of WSIs, enabling the learnt representations
to be more efficient and discriminative. We evaluated our method using two

results demonstrated that our DSF-WSI can effectively extract robust and

for text-independent speaker verification. However, it is difficult for
conventional TDNN to capture global context that has been proven critical for
robust speaker representations and long-duration speaker verification in many
recent works. Besides, the common solutions, e.g., self-attention, have
quadratic complexity for input tokens, which makes them computationally
unaffordable when applied to the feature maps with large sizes in TDNN. To
address these issues, we propose the Global Filter for TDNN, which applies
log-linear complexity FFT/IFFT and a set of differentiable frequency-domain
filters to efficiently model the long-term dependencies in speech. Besides, a
dynamic filtering strategy, and a sparse regularization method are specially
designed to enhance the performance of the global filter and prevent it from
overfitting. Furthermore, we construct a dual-stream TDNN (DS-TDNN), which
splits the basic channels for complexity reduction and employs the global
filter to increase recognition performance. Experiments on Voxceleb and SITW
databases show that the DS-TDNN achieves approximate 10% improvement with a
decline over 28% and 15% in complexity and parameters compared with the
ECAPA-TDNN. Besides, it has the best trade-off between efficiency and
effectiveness compared with other popular baseline systems when facing
long-duration speech. Finally, visualizations and a detailed ablation study
further reveal the advantages of the DS-TDNN.

methods is presented, whereby closed-loop constraint satisfaction is ensured
using recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization. Necessary and sufficient
conditions are derived for recursive feasibility, based on the effects of model
perturbations and disturbances occurring at one time step. Using these
conditions and Farkas' lemma, sufficient conditions suitable for design are
formulated. The proposed method is called a closed-loop design, as only the
existence of feasible inputs at the next time step is enforced by design. This
is in contrast to most existing formulations, which compute control policies
that are feasible under the worst-case realizations of all model perturbations
and exogenous disturbances in the MPC prediction horizon. The proposed method
has an online computational complexity similar to nominal MPC methods while
preserving guarantees of constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and
stability. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
approach.

a population synthesis technique is applied yielding metallicities, ages and
star formation history of the young and old stellar population together with
interstellar reddening and extinction. We adopt different lengths of the
initial starbursts and different initial mass functions for the calculation of
model spectra of the single stellar populations contributing to the total
integrated spectrum. We also allow for deviations of the ratio of extinction to
reddening RV from 3.1 and determine the value from the spectral fit. We find
that burst length and RV have a significant influence on the determination of
metallicities whereas the effect of the initial mass function is small. RV
values are larger than 3.1. The metallicities of the young stellar population
agree with extragalactic spectroscopic studies of individual massive supergiant
stars and are significantly higher than those of the older stellar population.
This confirms galaxy evolution models where metallicity depends on the ratio of

  This work proposes a universal, efficient framework that can reproduce the
output of a plethora of classical supervised machine learning algorithms
exploiting quantum computation's advantages. The proposed framework is named
Multiple Aggregator Quantum Algorithm (MAQA) due to its capability to combine
multiple and diverse functions to solve typical supervised learning problems.
In its general formulation, MAQA can be potentially adopted as the quantum
counterpart of all those models falling into the scheme of aggregation of
multiple functions, such as ensemble algorithms and neural networks. From a
computational point of view, the proposed framework allows generating an
exponentially large number of different transformations of the input at the
cost of increasing the depth of the corresponding quantum circuit linearly.
Thus, MAQA produces a model with substantial descriptive power to broaden the
horizon of possible applications of quantum machine learning with a
computational advantage over classical methods. As a second meaningful

providing a benchmark for future surveys of earlier cosmic epochs. The large
statistics of the observations from the SDSS DR7 Main galaxy sample and the

capable of simultaneously correcting for spectroscopic, r-band magnitude, and
emission-line incompleteness. We study the contribution to the LF of different
types of ELGs classified using two methods: (i) the specific star formation
rate (sSFR), and (ii) the line ratios on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT)

the surroundings. Despite the excellent performance, the existing 3D detectors
lack the robustness to real-world corruptions caused by adverse weathers,
sensor noises, etc., provoking concerns about the safety and reliability of
autonomous driving systems. To comprehensively and rigorously benchmark the
corruption robustness of 3D detectors, in this paper we design 27 types of
common corruptions for both LiDAR and camera inputs considering real-world
driving scenarios. By synthesizing these corruptions on public datasets, we
establish three corruption robustness benchmarks -- KITTI-C, nuScenes-C, and
Waymo-C. Then, we conduct large-scale experiments on 24 diverse 3D object
detection models to evaluate their corruption robustness. Based on the
evaluation results, we draw several important findings, including: 1)
motion-level corruptions are the most threatening ones that lead to significant
performance drop of all models; 2) LiDAR-camera fusion models demonstrate
better robustness; 3) camera-only models are extremely vulnerable to image
corruptions, showing the indispensability of LiDAR point clouds. We release the
benchmarks and codes at https://github.com/kkkcx/3D_Corruptions_AD. We hope

fibrillation require precise segmentation of cardiac structures in Intracardiac
Echocardiography (ICE) imaging. Prior studies have suggested methods that
employ 3D geometry information from the ICE transducer to create a sparse ICE
volume by placing 2D frames in a 3D grid, enabling training of 3D segmentation
models. However, the resulting 3D masks from these models can be inaccurate and
may lead to serious clinical complications due to the sparse sampling in ICE
data, frames misalignment, and cardiac motion. To address this issue, we
propose an interactive editing framework that allows users to edit segmentation
output by drawing scribbles on a 2D frame. The user interaction is mapped to
the 3D grid and utilized to execute an editing step that modifies the
segmentation in the vicinity of the interaction while preserving the previous
segmentation away from the interaction. Furthermore, our framework accommodates
multiple edits to the segmentation output in a sequential manner without
compromising previous edits. This paper presents a novel loss function and a
novel evaluation metric specifically designed for editing. Results from
cross-validation and testing indicate that our proposed loss function
outperforms standard losses and training strategies in terms of segmentation
quality and following user input. Additionally, we show quantitatively and
qualitatively that subsequent edits do not compromise previous edits when using
our method, as opposed to standard segmentation losses. Overall, our approach
enhances the accuracy of the segmentation while avoiding undesired changes away
from user interactions and without compromising the quality of previously
edited regions, leading to better patient outcomes.

  solving extensive-form games","23 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The extensive-form game has been studied considerably in recent years. It can
represent games with multiple decision points and incomplete information, and
hence it is helpful in formulating games with uncertain inputs, such as poker.
We consider an extended-form game with two players and zero-sum, i.e., the sum
of their payoffs is always zero. In such games, the problem of finding the
optimal strategy can be formulated as a bilinear saddle-point problem. This
formulation grows huge depending on the size of the game, since it has
variables representing the strategies at all decision points for each player.
To solve such large-scale bilinear saddle-point problems, the excessive gap
technique (EGT), a smoothing method, has been studied. This method generates a
sequence of approximate solutions whose error is guaranteed to converge at
$\mathcal{O}(1/k)$, where $k$ is the number of iterations. However, it has the
disadvantage of having poor theoretical bounds on the error related to the game
size. This makes it inapplicable to large games.
  Our goal is to improve the smoothing method for solving extensive-form games
so that it can be applied to large-scale games. To this end, we make two
contributions in this work. First, we slightly modify the strongly convex
function used in the smoothing method in order to improve the theoretical
bounds related to the game size. Second, we propose a heuristic called
centering trick, which allows the smoothing method to be combined with other
methods and consequently accelerates the convergence in practice. As a result,
we combine EGT with CFR+, a state-of-the-art method for extensive-form games,
to achieve good performance in games where conventional smoothing methods do
not perform well. The proposed smoothing method is shown to have the potential
to solve large games in practice.

strategy towards enhanced performance in patient-tailored bone tissue
engineering. The channels in such scaffolds offer pathways for nutrient and

In this study, we report an approach for the slurry based additive
manufacturing of modified diopside bioceramics that enables the production of
hollow-strut scaffolds with diverse cross-sectional forms, distinguished by
different configurations of channel and strut geometries. The prepared
scaffolds exhibit levels of porosity and mechanical strength that are well
suited for osteoporotic bone repair. Mechanical characterization in orthogonal
orientations revealed that a square outer cross-section for hollow struts in
woodpile scaffolds gives rise to levels of compressive strength that are higher
than those of conventional solid cylindrical strut scaffolds despite a
significantly lower density. Finite element analysis confirms that this
improved strength arises from lower stress concentration in such geometries. It
was shown that hollow struts in bioceramic scaffolds dramatically increase cell
attachment and proliferation, potentially promoting new bone tissue formation
within the scaffold channel. This work provides an easily controlled method for
the extrusion-based 3D printing of hollow strut scaffolds. We show here how the
production of hollow struts with controllable geometry can serve to enhance
both the functional and mechanical performance of porous structures, with
particular relevance for bone tissue engineering scaffolds.

vast potential of mitigating the dependence on large labeled datasets. The
latest methods (e.g., FixMatch) use a combination of consistency regularization
and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable successes. However, these methods all
suffer from the waste of complicated examples since all pseudo-labels have to
be selected by a high threshold to filter out noisy ones. Hence, the examples
with ambiguous predictions will not contribute to the training phase. For
better leveraging all unlabeled examples, we propose two novel techniques:
Entropy Meaning Loss (EML) and Adaptive Negative Learning (ANL). EML
incorporates the prediction distribution of non-target classes into the
optimization objective to avoid competition with target class, and thus
generating more high-confidence predictions for selecting pseudo-label. ANL
introduces the additional negative pseudo-label for all unlabeled data to
leverage low-confidence examples. It adaptively allocates this label by
dynamically evaluating the top-k performance of the model. EML and ANL do not
introduce any additional parameter and hyperparameter. We integrate these
techniques with FixMatch, and develop a simple yet powerful framework called
FullMatch. Extensive experiments on several common SSL benchmarks
(CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, STL-10 and ImageNet) demonstrate that FullMatch exceeds
FixMatch by a large margin. Integrated with FlexMatch (an advanced
FixMatch-based framework), we achieve state-of-the-art performance. Source code

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, despite their widespread use
in image synthesis and editing applications, their latent space is still not as
well understood. Recently, a semantic latent space for DDMs, coined
`$h$-space', was shown to facilitate semantic image editing in a way
reminiscent of GANs. The $h$-space is comprised of the bottleneck activations
in the DDM's denoiser across all timesteps of the diffusion process. In this
paper, we explore the properties of h-space and propose several novel methods
for finding meaningful semantic directions within it. We start by studying
unsupervised methods for revealing interpretable semantic directions in
pretrained DDMs. Specifically, we show that global latent directions emerge as
the principal components in the latent space. Additionally, we provide a novel
method for discovering image-specific semantic directions by spectral analysis
of the Jacobian of the denoiser w.r.t. the latent code. Next, we extend the
analysis by finding directions in a supervised fashion in unconditional DDMs.
We demonstrate how such directions can be found by relying on either a labeled
data set of real images or by annotating generated samples with a
domain-specific attribute classifier. We further show how to semantically
disentangle the found direction by simple linear projection. Our approaches are
applicable without requiring any architectural modifications, text-based
guidance, CLIP-based optimization, or model fine-tuning.

spectral analysis, the early low-energy spectral indices ($\alpha$) of this

decreases with the energy flux ($F$). A tight $E_{\rm p}\propto F^{0.54}$
correlation anyhow holds within the whole duration of the burst, where $E_{\rm

we find a log Bayes factor $\sim$ 210 in favor of a smoothly broken power-law
function over a linear function in log-linear space. We call this particular
$\alpha-F$ relation as broken ``$\alpha$-intensity"", and interpret it as the
evolution of the ratio of thermal and non-thermal components, which is also the
evolution of the photosphere. We also show that GRB 230307A with a duration of

daunting task. The need to properly resolve spatial and temporal scales

enable efficient computation while bounding/tracking errors and making informed
cost-accuracy tradeoffs. The biggest challenges arise when the applicability
conditions for upscaled models break down. Here, we present a non-intrusive
two-way coupled hybrid model, applied to thermal runaway in battery packs, that
combines fine- and upscaled equations in the same numerical simulation to
achieve predictive accuracy while limiting computational costs. First, we
develop two methods with different orders of accuracy to enforce continuity at
the coupling boundary. Then, we derive weak (i.e., variational) formulations of
the fine-scale and upscaled governing equations for finite element (FE)
discretization and numerical implementation in FEniCS. We demonstrate that
hybrid simulations can accurately predict the average temperature fields within
error bounds determined a priori by homogenization theory. Finally, we
demonstrate the computational efficiency of the hybrid algorithm against
fine-scale simulations.

Apache Beam SDK are used inside microservices to continuously process massive

clusters in the Google cloud and in a private cloud, where we deploy up to 110
simultaneously running microservice instances, which process up to one million

approximately linear scalability as long as sufficient cloud resources are
provisioned. However, the frameworks show considerable differences in the rate
at which resources have to be added to cope with increasing load. Moreover, we
observe that there is no clear superior framework, but the ranking of the
frameworks depends on the use case. Using Apache Beam as an abstraction layer
still comes at the cost of significantly higher resource requirements

network to disentangle different emotions in speech so as to generate rich 3D
facial expressions. Specifically, we introduce the emotion disentangling
encoder (EDE) to disentangle the emotion and content in the speech by
cross-reconstructed speech signals with different emotion labels. Then an
emotion-guided feature fusion decoder is employed to generate a 3D talking face
with enhanced emotion. The decoder is driven by the disentangled identity,
emotional, and content embeddings so as to generate controllable personal and
emotional styles. Finally, considering the scarcity of the 3D emotional talking
face data, we resort to the supervision of facial blendshapes, which enables
the reconstruction of plausible 3D faces from 2D emotional data, and contribute
a large-scale 3D emotional talking face dataset (3D-ETF) to train the network.
Our experiments and user studies demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and exhibits more diverse facial movements. We

work, we use a neural-network potential for water trained on the Revised
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional to describe the kinetics of the ice-water
interface. We study both ice melting and growth processes. Our results for the
ice growth rate are in reasonable agreement with previous experiments and
simulations. We find that the kinetics of ice melting presents a different
behavior (monotonic) than that of ice growth (non-monotonic). In particular, a
maximum in the ice growth rate of 6.5 {\AA}/ns is found at 14 K of
supercooling. The effect of the surface structure is explored by investigating
the basal and primary and secondary prismatic facets. We use the Wilson-Frenkel
relation to explain these results in terms of the mobility of molecules and the
thermodynamic driving force. Moreover, we study the effect of pressure by
complementing the standard isobar with simulations at negative pressure (-1000
bar) and at high pressure (2000 bar). We find that prismatic facets grow faster
than the basal one, and that pressure does not play an important role when the
speed of the interface is considered as a function of the difference between
the melting temperature and the actual one, i.e. to the degree of either
supercooling or overheating.

considers a recent body of work which suggests that general relativity requires
neither the support of dark matter halos, nor unconventional baryonic profiles,
nor any infrared modification, to be consistent after all with the anomalously
rapid orbits observed in many galactic discs. In particular, the
gravitoelectric flux is alleged to collapse nonlinearly into regions of
enhanced force, in an analogue of the colour-confining chromoelectric flux tube
model which has yet to be captured by conventional post-Newtonian methods.
However, we show that the scalar gravity model underpinning this proposal is
wholly inconsistent with the nonlinear Einstein equations, which themselves
appear to prohibit the linear confinement-type potentials which could indicate
a disordered gravitational phase. Our findings challenge the fidelity of the
previous Euclidean lattice analyses. We confirm by direct calculation using a
number of perturbation schemes and gauges that the next-to-leading order
gravitoelectric correction to the rotation curve of a reasonable baryonic
profile would be imperceptible. The `gravitoelectric flux collapse' programme
was also supported by using intragalactic lensing near a specific galactic
baryon profile as a field strength heuristic. We recalculate this lensing
effect, and conclude that it has been overstated by three orders of magnitude.
As a by-product, our analysis suggests fresh approaches to (i) the fluid ball
conjecture and (ii) gravitational energy localisation, both to be pursued in
future work. In summary, whilst it may be interesting to consider the
possibility of confinement-type effects in gravity, we may at least conclude
here that confinement-type effects $\textit{cannot play any significant part}$
in explaining flat or rising galactic rotation curves without dark matter

covariances that maps the original channel vectors to effective channels.
Measurements of these effective channels are received at the users via common
pilot transmission and sent back to the base station (BS) through analog
feedback without further processing. The BS estimates the effective channels
from received feedback and constructs a linear precoder by concatenating the
optimized pre-beamforming matrix with a zero-forcing precoder over the
effective channels. We show that the proposed method yields significantly
higher sum-rates than the state-of-the-art DNN-based channel training and
precoding scheme, especially in scenarios with small pilot and feedback size
relative to the channel coherence block length. Unlike many works in the

promising approach to pretrain a model without annotations, serving as an

molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), the former having ambipolar transport and the
latter showing electron-dominant unipolar transport. The proposed new formula
could describe both 2DM-FETs with Schottky or Ohmic contacts. Moreover,
compared with traditional methods, the proposed model has the advantages of
accuracy and efficiency, especially in describing non-monotonic drain
conductance characteristics, because the contact effect is self-consistently
and compactly packaged as an exponential term. More importantly, we also
examined the model at the circuit level. Here, we fabricated a three-bit
threshold inverter quantizer circuit based on ambipolar-BP process and
experimentally demonstrated that the model can accurately predict the circuit
performance. This industry-benign 2DM-FET model is supposed to be very useful
for the development of 2DM-FET-based integrated circuits.

image editing, the desirable interactive setting where the users can interact
with the system to adjust their requirements dynamically hasn't been well
explored. This paper focuses on facial image editing via dialogue and
introduces a new benchmark dataset, Multi-turn Interactive Image Editing
(I2Edit), for evaluating image editing quality and interaction ability in
real-world interactive facial editing scenarios. The dataset is constructed
upon the CelebA-HQ dataset with images annotated with a multi-turn dialogue
that corresponds to the user editing requirements. I2Edit is challenging, as it
needs to 1) track the dynamically updated user requirements and edit the images
accordingly, as well as 2) generate the appropriate natural language response
to communicate with the user. To address these challenges, we propose a
framework consisting of a dialogue module and an image editing module. The
former is for user edit requirements tracking and generating the corresponding
indicative responses, while the latter edits the images conditioned on the
tracked user edit requirements. In contrast to previous works that simply treat
multi-turn interaction as a sequence of single-turn interactions, we extract
the user edit requirements from the whole dialogue history instead of the
current single turn. The extracted global user edit requirements enable us to
directly edit the input raw image to avoid error accumulation and attribute
forgetting issues. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on the
I2Edit dataset demonstrate the advantage of our proposed framework over the
previous single-turn methods. We believe our new dataset could serve as a
valuable resource to push forward the exploration of real-world, complex
interactive image editing. Code and data will be made public.

a target application by the compiler, is an established technique for
collecting reliable, fine-grained performance data. The set of functions to
instrument has to be selected with care, as instrumenting every available
function typically yields too large a runtime overhead, thus skewing the
measurement. No ""one-suits-all"" selection mechanism exists, since the
instrumentation decision is dependent on the measurement objective, the limit
for tolerable runtime overhead and peculiarities of the target application. The
Compiler-assisted Performance Instrumentation (CaPI) tool assists in creating
such instrumentation configurations, by enabling the user to combine different
selection mechanisms as part of a configurable selection pipeline, operating on
a statically constructed whole-program call-graph. Previously, CaPI relied on a
static instrumentation workflow which made the process of refining the initial
selection quite cumbersome for large-scale codes, as the application had to be
recompiled after each adjustment. In this work, we present new
runtime-adaptable instrumentation capabilities for CaPI which do not require
recompilation when instrumentation changes are made. To this end, the XRay
instrumentation feature of the LLVM compiler was extended to support the
instrumentation of shared dynamic objects. An XRay-compatible runtime system
was added to CaPI that instruments selected functions at program start, thereby
significantly reducing the required time for selection refinements.
Furthermore, an interface to the TALP tool for recording parallel efficiency
metrics was implemented, alongside a specialized selection module for creating
suitable coarse-grained region instrumentations.

J1912+101, a TeV supernova remnant candidate probably associated with the radio
pulsar PSR J1913+1011. Methods: We obtained new observations at 1.5 GHz using
the VLA in the D configuration, with the purpose of detecting the radio shell
of the putative remnant. In addition, we observed a single pointing at 6.0 GHz
toward PSR J1913+1011 to look for a radio pulsar wind nebula. We also studied
the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium using data of the 13CO,
HI, and infrared emissions, obtained from public surveys. Results: We did not
find evidence of a radio shell down to the sensitivity of the new image at 1.5
GHz. We detect faint diffuse emission around PSR J1913+1011 at 6.0 GHz, which
could represent a radio pulsar wind nebula powered by the pulsar. We find dense
ambient gas at 60 km/s, which shows a good spatial correspondence with the TeV
emission only in the western and eastern directions. There is also dense gas
near the center of HESS J1912+101, where the TeV emission is weak. Using
infrared data, we identify an active star-forming region in the western part of
the shell. Conclusions: Based on the poor spatial match between the ambient gas
and the TeV emission (which shows a good correlation in the western and eastern
directions and an anticorrelation in the other directions), we conclude that
the hadronic mechanism alone does not give a satisfactory explanation of the
gamma rays from HESS J1912+101. Additional contributions may come from leptonic
processes in the shell of the supernova remnant, together with contributions
from PSR J1913$+$1011 and its pulsar wind nebula and/or from the star-forming
region. A confident determination of the distance to the putative remnant is
necessary to determine whether these sources are associated or just appear
superimposed in the line of sight.

significant drops in accuracy in the presence of common corruptions, such as
noise or blur. Interestingly, we observe that the attention mechanism of ViTs
tends to rely on few important tokens, a phenomenon we call token overfocusing.
More critically, these tokens are not robust to corruptions, often leading to
highly diverging attention patterns. In this paper, we intend to alleviate this
overfocusing issue and make attention more stable through two general
techniques: First, our Token-aware Average Pooling (TAP) module encourages the
local neighborhood of each token to take part in the attention mechanism.
Specifically, TAP learns average pooling schemes for each token such that the
information of potentially important tokens in the neighborhood can adaptively
be taken into account. Second, we force the output tokens to aggregate
information from a diverse set of input tokens rather than focusing on just a
few by using our Attention Diversification Loss (ADL). We achieve this by
penalizing high cosine similarity between the attention vectors of different
tokens. In experiments, we apply our methods to a wide range of transformer
architectures and improve robustness significantly. For example, we improve
corruption robustness on ImageNet-C by 2.4% while simultaneously improving
accuracy by 0.4% based on state-of-the-art robust architecture FAN. Also, when

environments than classical MHD since it actively treats the stress tensor
using a closure derived from physical principles. Stress tensor effects
nonetheless remain relatively unexplored for solar MHD phenomena, especially in
nonlinear regimes. This paper analytically examines nonlinear damping and
longitudinal flows of propagating shear Alfv\'en waves. Most previous studies
of MHD waves in Braginskii MHD considered the strict linear limit of vanishing
wave perturbations. We show that those former linear results only apply to
Alfv\'en wave amplitudes in the corona that are so small as to be of little
interest, typically a wave energy less than $10^{-11}$ times the energy of the
background magnetic field. For observed wave amplitudes, the Braginskii viscous
dissipation of coronal Alfv\'en waves is nonlinear and a factor around $10^9$
stronger than predicted by the linear theory. Furthermore, the dominant damping
occurs through the parallel viscosity coefficient $\eta_0$, rather than the
perpendicular viscosity coefficient $\eta_2$ in the linearized solution. This
paper develops the nonlinear theory, showing that the wave energy density
decays with an envelope $(1+z/L_d)^{-1}$. The damping length $L_d$ exhibits an
optimal damping solution, beyond which greater viscosity leads to lower
dissipation as the viscous forces self-organise the longitudinal flow to
suppress damping. Although the nonlinear damping greatly exceeds the linear
damping, it remains negligible for many coronal applications.

  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study with external validation,
122 patients with pre-capillary PH were used to train (n=83), validate (n=17)
and test (n=10 internal test, n=12 external test) a patch based DenseNet-121
classification model. ""Normal"", ""Ground glass"", ""Ground glass with
reticulation"", ""Honeycombing"", and ""Emphysema"" were classified as per the
Fleishner Society glossary of terms. Ground truth classes were segmented by two
radiologists with patches extracted from the labelled regions. Proportion of
lung volume for each texture was calculated by classifying patches throughout
the entire lung volume to generate a coarse texture classification mapping
throughout the lung parenchyma. AI output was assessed against diffusing
capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) and specialist radiologist reported disease
severity.
  Results: Micro-average AUCs for the validation, internal test, and external
test were 0.92, 0.95, and 0.94, respectively. The model had consistent
performance across parenchymal textures, demonstrated strong correlation with
diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), and showed good correspondence
with disease severity reported by specialist radiologists.
  Conclusion: The classification model demonstrates excellent performance on
external validation. The clinical utility of its output has been demonstrated.
This objective, repeatable measure of disease severity can aid in patient
management in adjunct to radiological reporting.

and their downstream training in deep learning research and applications. At
the same time, the defense for adversarial examples has been mainly
investigated in the context of training from random initialization on simple
classification tasks. To better exploit the potential of pre-trained models in
adversarial robustness, this paper focuses on the fine-tuning of an
adversarially pre-trained model in various classification tasks. Existing
research has shown that since the robust pre-trained model has already learned
a robust feature extractor, the crucial question is how to maintain the
robustness in the pre-trained model when learning the downstream task. We study
the model-based and data-based approaches for this goal and find that the two
common approaches cannot achieve the objective of improving both generalization
and adversarial robustness. Thus, we propose a novel statistics-based approach,
Two-WIng NormliSation (TWINS) fine-tuning framework, which consists of two
neural networks where one of them keeps the population means and variances of
pre-training data in the batch normalization layers. Besides the robust
information transfer, TWINS increases the effective learning rate without
hurting the training stability since the relationship between a weight norm and
its gradient norm in standard batch normalization layer is broken, resulting in
a faster escape from the sub-optimal initialization and alleviating the robust
overfitting. Finally, TWINS is shown to be effective on a wide range of image
classification datasets in terms of both generalization and robustness. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ziquanliu/CVPR2023-TWINS.

first pre-training a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance and then
fine-tuning it with image reconstruction guidance. We find that with a few
iterations of fine-tuning, the model shows wonderful colorization performance,

line drawing colorization benchmark dataset, which contains 31696 training data

high resolution anime face dataset for colorization method evaluation. Through
multiple quantitative metrics evaluated on our dataset and a user study, we
demonstrate AnimeDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art GANs-based models for

more fully integrate AI into manufacturing systems. Three overarching themes
emerged from the panel discussion. First, to be successful, AI will need to
work seamlessly, and in an integrated manner with humans (and vice versa).
Second, significant gaps in the infrastructure needed to enable the full
potential of AI into the manufacturing ecosystem, including sufficient data
availability, storage, and analysis, must be addressed. And finally, improved
coordination between universities, industry, and government agencies can
facilitate greater opportunities to push the field forward. This article

  that were omitted in the final conference version",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a simple and generic method to analyze randomized rumor spreading
processes in fully connected networks. In contrast to all previous works, which
heavily exploit the precise definition of the process under investigation, we
only need to understand the probability and the covariance of the events that
uninformed nodes become informed. This universality allows us to easily analyze
the classic push, pull, and push-pull protocols both in their pure version and
in several variations such as messages failing with constant probability or
nodes calling a random number of others each round. Some dynamic models can be
analyzed as well, e.g., when the network is a $G(n,p)$ random graph sampled
independently each round [Clementi et al. (ESA 2013)].
  Despite this generality, our method determines the expected rumor spreading
time precisely apart from additive constants, which is more precise than almost
all previous works. We also prove tail bounds showing that a deviation from the
expectation by more than an additive number of $r$ rounds occurs with
probability at most $\exp(-\Omega(r))$.
  We further use our method to discuss the common assumption that nodes can
answer any number of incoming calls. We observe that the restriction that only
one call can be answered leads to a significant increase of the runtime of the
push-pull protocol. In particular, the double logarithmic end phase of the
process now takes logarithmic time. This also increases the message complexity
from the asymptotically optimal $\Theta(n \log\log n)$ [Karp, Shenker,
Schindelhauer, V\""ocking (FOCS 2000)] to $\Theta(n \log n)$. We propose a
simple variation of the push-pull protocol that reverts back to the double
logarithmic end phase and thus to the $\Theta(n \log\log n)$ message
complexity.

information, where minimization of average statistics, such as the average AoI
and average peak AoI, currently prevails in guiding freshness optimization for
related applications. Although minimizing the statistics does improve the
received information's freshness for status update systems in the sense of
average, the time-varying fading characteristics of wireless channels often
cause uncertain yet frequent age violations. The recently-proposed statistical
AoI metric can better characterize more features of AoI dynamics, which
evaluates the achievable minimum peak AoI under the certain constraint on age
violation probability. In this paper, we study the statistical AoI minimization
problem for status update systems over multi-state fading channels, which can
effectively upper-bound the AoI violation probability but introduce the
prohibitively-high computing complexity. To resolve this issue, we tackle the
problem with a two-fold approach. For a small AoI exponent, the problem is
approximated via a fractional programming problem. For a large AoI exponent,
the problem is converted to a convex problem. Solving the two problems
respectively, we derive the near-optimal sampling interval for diverse status
update systems. Insightful observations are obtained on how sampling interval
shall be tuned as a decreasing function of channel state information (CSI).
Surprisingly, for the extremely stringent AoI requirement, the sampling
interval converges to a constant regardless of CSI's variation. Numerical
results verify effectiveness as well as superiority of our proposed scheme.

declining to 24% for M_bulge < 10^10 M_sun. Furthermore, we observe

revisit this problem with a large-scale benchmark and analyze the performance
of traditional CL approaches in a compute-constrained setting, where effective

of limited computation. We conduct experiments evaluating various CL sampling
strategies, distillation losses, and partial fine-tuning on two large-scale

incremental, class incremental, and time incremental settings. Through
extensive experiments amounting to a total of over 1500 GPU-hours, we find
that, under compute-constrained setting, traditional CL approaches, with no
exception, fail to outperform a simple minimal baseline that samples uniformly

goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) tasks: they provide a sequence of
subgoals to reach the target-goal, and the agents learn to execute
subgoal-conditioned policies. However, the sample-efficiency of such RL schemes
still remains a challenge, particularly for long-horizon tasks. To address this
issue, we present a simple yet effective self-imitation scheme which distills a
subgoal-conditioned policy into the target-goal-conditioned policy. Our
intuition here is that to reach a target-goal, an agent should pass through a
subgoal, so target-goal- and subgoal- conditioned policies should be similar to
each other. We also propose a novel scheme of stochastically skipping executed
subgoals in a planned path, which further improves performance. Unlike prior
methods that only utilize graph-based planning in an execution phase, our
method transfers knowledge from a planner along with a graph into policy
learning. We empirically show that our method can significantly boost the
sample-efficiency of the existing goal-conditioned RL methods under various
long-horizon control tasks.

subclusters through accretion of gas from the giant molecular cloud within
which the subclusters are embedded. The two main accretion mechanisms
responsible for this are accretion of gas from dense filaments, and from the
ambient background of the cloud. We perform simulations of both of these
accretion processes onto gas-rich star clusters using coupled smoothed particle
hydrodynamics to model the gas, and N-body dynamics to model the stars. We find
that, for both accretion processes, the accreting star cluster loses some of
its original mass while gaining mass from either the ambient background or the
dense filament. The amount of mass lost from both these processes is small
compared to the total mass of the cluster. However, in the case of accretion
from a background medium, the net effect can be a decrease in the total mass of
the cluster if it is travelling fast enough through the ambient medium ($>
4$kms$^{-1}$). We find that the amount of mass lost from the cluster through
filamentary accretion is independent of the density, width, or number of
filaments funneling gas into the cluster and is always such that the mass of
the cluster is constantly increasing with time. We compare our results to
idealized prescriptions used to model star cluster formation in larger scale
GMC simulations and find that such prescriptions act as an upper limit when

learned network does not have the capability to characterize the prediction
error, generate feedback information from the test sample, and correct the
prediction error on the fly for each individual test sample, which results in
degraded performance in generalization. In this work, we introduce a
self-correctable and adaptable inference (SCAI) method to address the

an example to demonstrate its effectiveness and performance. We learn a
correction network to correct the prediction result conditioned by a fitness
feedback error. This feedback error is generated by a learned fitness feedback
network which maps the prediction result to the original input domain and
compares it against the original input. Interestingly, we find that this
self-referential feedback error is highly correlated with the actual prediction
error. This strong correlation suggests that we can use this error as feedback
to guide the correction process. It can be also used as a loss function to
quickly adapt and optimize the correction network during the inference process.
Our extensive experimental results on human pose estimation demonstrate that
the proposed SCAI method is able to significantly improve the generalization

spectra of HAeBe stars show HI emission lines belonging to Balmer, Paschen and
Brackett series. We use the archival X-Shooter spectra available for 109 HAeBe
stars from Vioque et al. (2018) and analyse the various HI lines present in
them. We segregated the stars into different classes based on the presence of
higher-order lines in different HI series. We discuss the dependence of the
appearance of higher-order lines on the stellar parameters. We find that most
massive and younger stars show all the higher-order lines in emission. The
stars showing only lower-order lines have Teff < 12000 K and an age range of
5-10 Myr. We perform a Case B line ratio analysis for a sub-sample of stars
showing most of the HI lines in emission. We note that all but four stars
belonging to the sub-sample show lower HI line ratios than theoretical values,
owing to the emitting medium being optically thick. The HI line flux ratios do
not depend on the star's spectral type. Further, from the line ratios of
lower-order lines and Paschen higher-order lines, we note that line ratios of
most HAeBe stars match with electron density value in the range 10^9 - 10^11
cm^-3. The electron temperature, however, could not be ascertained with

in recent years, annotation remains expensive and time-consuming, leading to a
demand for semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods with application
domains such as autonomous driving. Existing work very often employs relatively
large segmentation backbone networks to improve segmentation accuracy, at the
expense of computational costs. In addition, many use uniform sampling to
reduce ground truth data requirements for learning needed, often resulting in
sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a new pipeline
that employs a smaller architecture, requiring fewer ground-truth annotations
to achieve superior segmentation accuracy compared to contemporary approaches.
This is facilitated via a novel Sparse Depthwise Separable Convolution module
that significantly reduces the network parameter count while retaining overall
task performance. To effectively sub-sample our training data, we propose a new
Spatio-Temporal Redundant Frame Downsampling (ST-RFD) method that leverages
knowledge of sensor motion within the environment to extract a more diverse
subset of training data frame samples. To leverage the use of limited annotated
data samples, we further propose a soft pseudo-label method informed by LiDAR
reflectivity. Our method outperforms contemporary semi-supervised work in terms
of mIoU, using less labeled data, on the SemanticKITTI (59.5@5%) and
ScribbleKITTI (58.1@5%) benchmark datasets, based on a 2.3x reduction in model

physical quantities and determining the properties of materials. This work
provides a quantum ground state preparation scheme with shallow variational
warm-start to tackle the bottlenecks of current algorithms, i.e., demand for
prior ground state energy information and lack of demonstration of efficient
initial state preparation. Particularly, our methods would not experience the
instability for small spectral gap $\Delta$ during pre-encoding the phase
factors since our methods involve only $\widetilde{O}(1)$ factors while
$\widetilde{O}(\Delta^{-1})$ is requested by the near-optimal methods. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods via extensive numerical
simulations on spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg models. We also show that the shallow
warm-start procedure can process chemical molecules by conducting numerical
simulations on the hydrogen chain model. Moreover, we extend research on the
Hubbard model, demonstrating superior performance compared to the prevalent
variational quantum algorithms.

In particular, for fixed integers $r$, $\ell\geq 2$ they showed that $\hat
p_{K_\ell,r}(n)=n^{-\frac{2}{\ell+1}}$ is a threshold for the Ramsey property
that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the binomial random graph $G(n,p)$
yields a monochromatic copy of $K_\ell$. We investigate how this result extends
to arbitrary colourings of $G(n,p)$ with an unbounded number of colours. In
this situation, Erd\H{o}s and Rado showed that canonically coloured copies of
$K_\ell$ can be ensured in the deterministic setting. We transfer the
Erd\H{o}s-Rado theorem to the random environment and show that both thresholds
coincide for $\ell\geq 4$. As a consequence, the proof yields $K_{\ell+1}$-free
graphs $G$ for which every edge colouring contains a canonically coloured

  The $0$-statement of the threshold is a direct consequence of the

WRs in the Magellanic Clouds. The WN3/O3s show the emission lines of a
high-excitation WN star and the absorption lines of a hot O-type star, but our
prior work has shown that the absorption spectrum is intrinsic to the WR star.
Their place in the evolution of massive stars remains unclear. Here we
investigate the possibility that they are the products of binary evolution.
Although these are not WN3+O3~V binaries, they could still harbor unseen
companions. To address this possibility, we have conducted a multi-year radial
velocity study of six of the nine known WN3/O3s. Our study finds no evidence of
statistically significant radial velocity variations, and allows us to set
stringent upper limits on the mass of any hypothetical companion star: for
probable orbital inclinations, any companion with a period less than 100 days
must have a mass less than 2Mo. For periods less than 10 days, any companion
would have to have a mass less than 1Mo. We argue that scenarios where any such
companion is a compact object are unlikely. The absorption lines indicate a
normal projected rotational velocity, making it unlikely that these stars
evolved with the aid of a companion star that has since merged. The modest
rotation also suggests that these stars are not the result of homogenous
evolution. Thus it is likely that these stars are a normal but short-lived
stage in the evolution of massive stars.

microscopes is physically limited due to the diffraction of visible light,
which makes the study of entities of size less than the diffraction barrier
(around 200 nm in the x-y plane) very challenging. To overcome this limitation,
several deconvolution and super-resolution techniques have been proposed.
Within the framework of inverse problems, modern approaches in fluorescence
microscopy reconstruct a super-resolved image from a temporal stack of frames
by carefully designing suitable hand-crafted sparsity-promoting regularisers.
Numerically, such approaches are solved by proximal gradient-based iterative
schemes. Aiming at obtaining a reconstruction more adapted to sample geometries
(e.g. thin filaments), we adopt a plug-and-play denoising approach with
convergence guarantees and replace the proximity operator associated with the
explicit image regulariser with an image denoiser (i.e. a pre-trained network)
which, upon appropriate training, mimics the action of an implicit prior. To
account for the independence of the fluctuations between molecules, the model
relies on second-order statistics. The denoiser is then trained on covariance
images coming from data representing sequences of fluctuating fluorescent
molecules with filament structure. The method is evaluated on both simulated
and real fluorescence microscopy images, showing its ability to correctly
reconstruct filament structures with high values of peak signal-to-noise ratio

superconductor adjacent to a normal metal corresponds to a step-function quench
of the pairing interaction in real space, the spatial KZM is based on a linear
drop of the interaction that can be modeled as a spatial quench. After
formulating the Fermi gases with spatially varying pairing interactions by the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain the profiles of the pair wavefunction
and its correlation function to study their penetration into the noninteracting
region. For the step-function quench, both correlation lengths from the pair
wavefunction and its correlation function follow the BCS coherence length and
exhibit the same scaling behavior. In contrast, the scaling behavior of the two
correlation lengths are different in the spatial quench, which then allows more
refined analyses of the correlation lengths from different physical quantities.
Moreover, adding a weakly interacting bosonic background does not change the
scaling behavior. We also discuss relevant experimental techniques that may
realize and verify the inhomogeneous phenomena.

In this paper, we introduce a new framework FedMAE, which stands for Federated
Masked AutoEncoder, to address the problem of how to utilize unlabeled
large-scale images for FL. Specifically, FedMAE can pre-train one-block Masked
AutoEncoder (MAE) using large images in lightweight client devices, and then
cascades multiple pre-trained one-block MAEs in the server to build a
multi-block ViT backbone for downstream tasks. Theoretical analysis and
experimental results on image reconstruction and classification show that our
FedMAE achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FSSL
methods.

that (1) governments be able to enforce rules on the development of advanced ML

compliance with potential future international agreements on advanced ML
development. This work analyzes one mechanism to achieve this, by monitoring
the computing hardware used for large-scale NN training. The framework's
primary goal is to provide governments high confidence that no actor uses large
quantities of specialized ML chips to execute a training run in violation of
agreed rules. At the same time, the system does not curtail the use of consumer
computing devices, and maintains the privacy and confidentiality of ML
practitioners' models, data, and hyperparameters. The system consists of
interventions at three stages: (1) using on-chip firmware to occasionally save
snapshots of the the neural network weights stored in device memory, in a form
that an inspector could later retrieve; (2) saving sufficient information about
each training run to prove to inspectors the details of the training run that
had resulted in the snapshotted weights; and (3) monitoring the chip supply
chain to ensure that no actor can avoid discovery by amassing a large quantity
of un-tracked chips. The proposed design decomposes the ML training rule

properties of $2$-proper holomorphic maps (such as the construction of some

biholomorphisms) which arise as $2$-proper holomorphic images of bounded

domain of type $IV$ (Lie ball) of dimension $n$ and $\Lambda_n : L_n \to

show that $\mathbb L_n$ cannot be exhausted by domains biholomorhic to any
convex domains. Any proper holomorphic self-mapping of $\mathbb L_n$ is an
automorphism for $n \geq 3.$ Moreover, the automorphism group ${\rm

performs cross-domain feature alignment but also enforces target samples to
align with the corresponding prototypes of a given source domain. Since target
labels in a target domain are unavailable, we use a clustering-based approach
with carefully initialized centers by a batch of source domain samples to
produce pseudo labels. Moreover, we use a cross-attention mechanism on a pair
of source data and target data with the same labels to learn domain-invariant
representations. Because the samples in a domain pair tend to express similar
semantic patterns, especially on the people's attitudes (e.g., supporting or
denying) towards the same category of rumors, the discrepancy between a pair of
the source domain and target domain will be decreased. We conduct experiments
on four groups of cross-domain datasets and show that our proposed model

solve several machine-learning-based optimisation problems. A fuzzy set theory
determines appropriate levels of exploration and exploitation while managing

recombination reaction of a pair of radicals in the protein cryptochrome. Many
theoretical studies of this model have ignored inter-radical interactions,
particularly the electron-electron dipolar coupling (EED), which have a
detrimental effect on the magnetosensitivity. Here, we set out to elucidate if
a radical pair allowed to undergo internal motion can yield enhanced
magneto-sensitivity. Our model considers the effects of diffusive motion of one
radical partner along a one-dimensional reaction coordinate. Such dynamics
could in principle be realized either via actual diffusion of a mobile radical
through a protein channel, or via bound radical pairs subjected to protein
structural rearrangements and fluctuations. We demonstrate that the suppressive
effect of the EED interactions can be alleviated in these scenarios as a result
of the quantum Zeno effect and intermittent reduction of the EED coupling
during the radical's diffusive excursions. Our results highlight the importance
of the dynamic environment entwined with the radical pair and ensuing
magnetosensitivity under strong EED coupling, where it had not previously been
anticipated, and demonstrate that a triplet-born radical pair can develop
superior sensitivity over a singlet-born one.

frequency is near 1.5e10 Hz. As the band structures are corroborated by the
measured scattering parameters, we introduce the concept of photonic
topological insulator based on the quantum Valley Hall effect into the plasma
photonic crystal. A valley-dependent plasma photonic crystal with hexagonal
lattice is constructed, and the phase transition of the valley K(K') occurs by
breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Valley-spin locked topological edge
states are generated and excited by chiral sources. The frequency of the
non-bulk state can be dynamically regulated by the electron density. This
concept paves the way for novel, tunable topological edge states. More
interestingly, the Dirac cone is broken when the electron density increases to
3.1e12 cm-3, which distinguishes from the methods of applying a magnetic field
and changing the symmetry of the point group.

object detection. The most basic methods include insertion of copied objects
and rotation and scaling of the entire training frame. Numerous variants have
been developed as well. The existing methods, however, are considerably limited
when compared to the variety of the real world possibilities. In this work, we
develop a diversified and realistic augmentation method that can flexibly
construct a whole-body object, freely locate and rotate the object, and apply
self-occlusion and external-occlusion accordingly. To improve the diversity of
the whole-body object construction, we develop an iterative method that
stochastically combines multiple objects observed from the real world into a
single object. Unlike the existing augmentation methods, the constructed
objects can be randomly located and rotated in the training frame because
proper occlusions can be reflected to the whole-body objects in the final step.
Finally, proper self-occlusion at each local object level and
external-occlusion at the global frame level are applied using the Hidden Point
Removal (HPR) algorithm that is computationally efficient. HPR is also used for
adaptively controlling the point density of each object according to the
object's distance from the LiDAR. Experiment results show that the proposed
DR.CPO algorithm is data-efficient and model-agnostic without incurring any
computational overhead. Also, DR.CPO can improve mAP performance by 2.08% when
compared to the best 3D detection result known for KITTI dataset. The code is

dividends in performance for deep learning based medical image analysis.
However, generating corresponding segmentation masks for synthetic medical
images is laborious and subjective. To obtain paired synthetic medical images
and segmentations, conditional generative models that use segmentation masks as
synthesis conditions were proposed. However, these segmentation
mask-conditioned generative models still relied on large, varied, and labeled
training datasets, and they could only provide limited constraints on human
anatomical structures, leading to unrealistic image features. Moreover, the
invariant pixel-level conditions could reduce the variety of synthetic lesions
and thus reduce the efficacy of data augmentation. To address these issues, in
this work, we propose a novel strategy for medical image synthesis, namely
Unsupervised Mask (UM)-guided synthesis, to obtain both synthetic images and
segmentations using limited manual segmentation labels. We first develop a
superpixel based algorithm to generate unsupervised structural guidance and
then design a conditional generative model to synthesize images and annotations
simultaneously from those unsupervised masks in a semi-supervised multi-task
setting. In addition, we devise a multi-scale multi-task Fr\'echet Inception
Distance (MM-FID) and multi-scale multi-task standard deviation (MM-STD) to
harness both fidelity and variety evaluations of synthetic CT images. With
multiple analyses on different scales, we could produce stable image quality
measurements with high reproducibility. Compared with the segmentation mask
guided synthesis, our UM-guided synthesis provided high-quality synthetic
images with significantly higher fidelity, variety, and utility ($p<0.05$ by
Wilcoxon Signed Ranked test).

because they give exact solutions (in the statistical sense), however, in the
case of statistical mixtures they are enormously time consuming and their
implementation is often extremely complex. For this reason, the aim of the
present contribution is to propose a new approach that should allow us in the
future to simplify the MC approach. This is done through an explanatory
example, i.e.; by deriving the `exact' analytical expression for the
probability density function of photons' random steps (single step function,
SSF) propagating in a medium represented as a binary (isotropic-Poisson)
statistical mixture. The use of the SSF reduces the problem to an `equivalent'
homogeneous medium behaving exactly as the original binary statistical mixture.
This will reduce hundreds time-consuming MC simulations to only one equivalent
simple MC simulation. To the best of our knowledge the analytically `exact' SSF
for a binary (isotropic-Poisson) statistical mixture has never been derived

time-consuming and expensive. To reduce the annotation cost, we propose a
superpixel-based active learning (AL) framework, which collects a dominant
label per superpixel instead. To be specific, it consists of adaptive
superpixel and sieving mechanisms, fully dedicated to AL. At each round of AL,
we adaptively merge neighboring pixels of similar learned features into
superpixels. We then query a selected subset of these superpixels using an
acquisition function assuming no uniform superpixel size. This approach is more
efficient than existing methods, which rely only on innate features such as RGB
color and assume uniform superpixel sizes. Obtaining a dominant label per
superpixel drastically reduces annotators' burden as it requires fewer clicks.
However, it inevitably introduces noisy annotations due to mismatches between
superpixel and ground truth segmentation. To address this issue, we further
devise a sieving mechanism that identifies and excludes potentially noisy
annotations from learning. Our experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC
datasets demonstrate the efficacy of adaptive superpixel and sieving
mechanisms.

low cost. But accurately inferring 3D geometry solely from camera data remains
challenging, which impacts model performance. One promising approach to address
this issue is to distill precise 3D geometry knowledge from LiDAR data.
However, transferring knowledge between different sensor modalities is hindered
by the significant modality gap. In this paper, we approach this challenge from
the perspective of both architecture design and knowledge distillation and
present a new simulated multi-modal 3D object detection method named BEVSimDet.
We first introduce a novel framework that includes a LiDAR and camera
fusion-based teacher and a simulated multi-modal student, where the student
simulates multi-modal features with image-only input. To facilitate effective
distillation, we propose a simulated multi-modal distillation scheme that
supports intra-modal, cross-modal, and multi-modal distillation simultaneously,
in Bird's-eye-view (BEV) space. By combining them together, BEVSimDet can learn
better feature representations for 3D object detection while enjoying
cost-effective camera-only deployment. Experimental results on the challenging
nuScenes benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of BEVSimDet
over recent representative methods. The source code will be released at

detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. A rapid density
increase in a neutron star core could also trigger the phase transition from
hadrons to deconfined quarks and form a hybrid star. This formation process
could release a considerable amount of energy in the form of gravitational
waves and neutrinos. Hence, the formation of a magnetized hybrid star is an
interesting scenario for detecting all these signals. These detections may
provide essential probes for the magnetic field and composition of such stars.
Thus far, a dynamical study of the formation of a magnetized hybrid star has
yet to be realized. Here, we investigate the formation dynamics and the
properties of a magnetized hybrid star through dynamical simulations. We find
that the maximum values of rest-mass density and magnetic field strength
increase slightly and these two quantities are coupled in phase during the
formation. We then demonstrate that all microscopic and macroscopic quantities
of the resulting hybrid star vary dramatically when the maximum magnetic field
strength goes beyond a threshold of $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ G but they are
insensitive to the magnetic field below this threshold. Specifically, the
magnetic deformation makes the rest-mass density drop significantly,
suppressing the matter fraction in the mixed phase. Therefore, this work
provides a solid support for the magnetic effects on a hybrid star, so it is
possible to link observational signals from the star to its magnetic field
configuration.

about the nuanced interactions among traffic participants. This poses a highly
challenging decision making problem since human behavior is influenced by a
multitude of factors (e.g., human intentions and emotions) that are hard to
model. This paper presents a decision making approach for autonomous driving,
focusing on the complex task of merging into moving traffic where uncertainty
emanates from the behavior of other drivers and imperfect sensor measurements.
We frame the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
and solve it online with Monte Carlo tree search. The solution to the POMDP is
a policy that performs high-level driving maneuvers, such as giving way to an
approaching car, keeping a safe distance from the vehicle in front or merging
into traffic. Our method leverages a model learned from data to predict the
future states of traffic while explicitly accounting for interactions among the
surrounding agents. From these predictions, the autonomous vehicle can
anticipate the future consequences of its actions on the environment and
optimize its trajectory accordingly. We thoroughly test our approach in
simulation, showing that the autonomous vehicle can adapt its behavior to
different situations. We also compare against other methods, demonstrating an
improvement with respect to the considered performance metrics.

using dissipation optimized POD velocity modes. The method can be fine-tuned by
varying the number of TKE optimized modes, and may be generalized to

reduces the degree of non-orthogonality compared to dissipation optimized

reverses beyond a pair separation of $\sim 50$ kpc. The interacting pairs with
larger separations ($>50$ kpc) in filaments are on average redder and low-star
forming when compared to those embedded in sheets. The galaxies in filaments
and sheets may have different stellar mass and cold gas mass distributions.
Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we find that for paired galaxies with pair
separation $<50$ kpc, there are no significant differences in these properties
in sheets and filaments. The filaments transport gas towards the cluster of
galaxies. Some earlier studies find preferential alignment of galaxy pairs with
filament axis. Such alignment of galaxy pairs may lead to different gas
accretion efficiency in galaxies residing in filaments and sheets. We propose
that the enhancement of star formation rate at smaller pair separation in
filaments is caused by the alignment of galaxy pairs. A recent study with the
SDSS data (Das et al., 2023) reports the same findings. The confirmation of
these results by the EAGLE simulations suggests that the hydrodynamical

decoder-only designs. In addition, the common knowledge has it that the two
most popular multimodal tasks, the generative and contrastive tasks, tend to
conflict with one another, are hard to accommodate in one architecture, and
further need complex adaptations for downstream tasks. We propose a novel
paradigm of training with a decoder-only model for multimodal tasks, which is
surprisingly effective in jointly learning of these disparate vision-language
tasks. This is done with a simple model, called MaMMUT. It consists of a single
vision encoder and a text decoder, and is able to accommodate contrastive and
generative learning by a novel two-pass approach on the text decoder. We
demonstrate that joint learning of these diverse objectives is simple,
effective, and maximizes the weight-sharing of the model across these tasks.
Furthermore, the same architecture enables straightforward extensions to
open-vocabulary object detection and video-language tasks. The model tackles a
diverse range of tasks, while being modest in capacity. Our model achieves the
state of the art on image-text and text-image retrieval, video question
answering and open-vocabulary detection tasks, outperforming much larger and
more extensively trained foundational models. It shows very competitive results
on VQA and Video Captioning, especially considering its capacity. Ablations

design's proximity to an unattainable orthogonal design. Such a criterion does
not directly measure a design's quality in terms of screening. To address this
disconnect, we develop optimality criteria to maximize the lasso's sign
recovery probability. The criteria have varying amounts of prior knowledge
about the model's parameters. We show that an orthogonal design is an ideal

These conclusions are based on a continuous optimization framework, which

select the one that maximizes the sign recovery probability under the lasso.

domination in online interaction networks. Twitter data collected before and
during the 2022 Brazilian elections is used as a case study. From a theoretical
perspective, we develop a methodology called d-modularity that allows
discovering the contribution of specific groups to network polarization using
the well-known modularity measure. While the overall network modularity
(somewhat unexpectedly) decreased, the proposed group-oriented approach allows
concluding that the contribution of the right-leaning community to this
modularity increased, remaining very high during the analyzed period. Our
methodology is general enough to be used in any situation when the contribution
of specific groups to overall network modularity and polarization is needed to
investigate. Moreover, using the concept of partial domination, we are able to
compare the reach of sets of influential profiles from different groups and
their ability to accomplish coordinated communication inside their groups and
across segments of the entire network during some specific time window. We show
that in the whole network, the left-leaning high-influential information
spreaders dominated, reaching a substantial fraction of users with fewer
spreaders. However, when comparing domination inside the groups, the results
are inverse. Right-leaning spreaders dominate their communities using few
nodes, showing as the most capable of accomplishing coordinated communication.
The results bring evidence of extreme isolation and the ease of accomplishing
coordinated communication that characterized right-leaning communities during
the 2022 Brazilian elections.

the attacking effect of adversarial samples lying in the vicinity of clean

matches the metallicity of the primary system, suggesting that oxygen is
missing from the atmosphere. Even with extreme mixing, the implied C/O is well
beyond the typical stellar regime, suggesting a either non-stellar formation
pathway, or the sequestration of substantial quantities of oxygen via hitherto
unmodeled chemistry or condensation processes.

in time or frequency is carried out to smooth the data. This paper presents a
novel processing method of the CSI phase to improve the accuracy of human

Smoothing and Frequency Rebuild (TSFR), consists of performing a CSI phase
sanitization method to remove phase impairments based on a linear regression

eliminating distortions in frequency caused by SG filtering. The TSFR method
has been tested on five datasets obtained from experimental measurements, using
three different deep learning algorithms, and compared against five other types
of CSI phase processing. The results show an accuracy improvement using TSFR in
all the cases. Concretely, accuracy performance higher than 90\% in most of the
studied scenarios has been achieved with the proposed solution. In few-shot
learning strategies, TSFR outperforms the state-of-the-art performance from

crucial yet challenging task. Recent studies have shown the great potential of
dense correspondence-based solutions, yet improvements are still needed to
reach practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a novel pose estimation
algorithm named CheckerPose, which improves on three main aspects. Firstly,
CheckerPose densely samples 3D keypoints from the surface of the 3D object and
finds their 2D correspondences progressively in the 2D image. Compared to
previous solutions that conduct dense sampling in the image space, our strategy
enables the correspondence searching in a 2D grid (i.e., pixel coordinate).
Secondly, for our 3D-to-2D correspondence, we design a compact binary code
representation for 2D image locations. This representation not only allows for
progressive correspondence refinement but also converts the correspondence
regression to a more efficient classification problem. Thirdly, we adopt a
graph neural network to explicitly model the interactions among the sampled 3D
keypoints, further boosting the reliability and accuracy of the
correspondences. Together, these novel components make our CheckerPose a strong
pose estimation algorithm. When evaluated on the popular Linemod, Linemod-O,
and YCB-V object pose estimation benchmarks, CheckerPose clearly boosts the
accuracy of correspondence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art

drugs, administered more commonly for patients with cancer, HIV, malaria, or

""combination drug therapy"" MeSH heading with at least 10K articles published
per year over the past two decades. Extracting combination therapies from
scientific literature inherently constitutes an $n$-ary relation extraction
problem. Unlike in the general $n$-ary setting where $n$ is fixed (e.g.,
drug-gene-mutation relations where $n=3$), extracting combination therapies is
a special setting where $n \geq 2$ is dynamic, depending on each instance.
Recently, Tiktinsky et al. (NAACL 2022) introduced a first of its kind dataset,
CombDrugExt, for extracting such therapies from literature. Here, we use a
sequence-to-sequence style end-to-end extraction method to achieve an F1-Score

is more fine-grained than that of the target problem. We experiment with this
method using the label hierarchy of iNaturalist 2021, and observe a 8.76%
relative improvement of the error rate over the baseline. We find the following
conditions are key for the improvement: 1) the pretraining dataset has a strong
and meaningful label hierarchy, 2) its label function strongly aligns with that
of the target task, and most importantly, 3) an appropriate level of
pretraining label granularity is chosen. The importance of pretraining label
granularity is further corroborated by our transfer learning experiments on
ImageNet. Most notably, we show that pretraining at the leaf labels of
ImageNet21k produces better transfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining at
other coarser granularity levels, which supports the common practice.
Theoretically, through an analysis on a two-layer convolutional ReLU network,
we prove that: 1) models trained on coarse-grained labels only respond strongly
to the common or ""easy-to-learn"" features; 2) with the dataset satisfying the
right conditions, fine-grained pretraining encourages the model to also learn

using strong supervision from base annotations and novel category information
using weak supervision from image-captions pairs. This difference between
strong and weak supervision leads to overfitting on base categories, resulting
in poor generalization towards novel categories. In this work, we overcome this

their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to
decompose large-kernel depthwise convolution into four parallel branches along
channel dimension, i.e. small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and
an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a
series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs
but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T
achieves 1.6x higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains
0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K. We anticipate InceptionNeXt can
serve as an economical baseline for future architecture design to reduce carbon
footprint. Code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/inceptionnext.

captivating public attention and driving scientific inquiry; however, the rush
to confirm exoplanet discoveries has often overlooked potential alternative
explanations leading to a scientific consensus that is overly reliant on
untested assumptions and limited data. We argue that the evidence in support of
exoplanet observation is not necessarily definitive and that alternative
interpretations are not only possible, but necessary. Our conclusion is
therefore concise: exoplanets do not exist. Here, we present the framework for
a novel type of cuboid star, or squar, which can precisely reproduce the full
range of observed phenomena in stellar light curves, including the trapezoidal
flux deviations (TFDs) often attributed to ""exoplanets."" In this discovery
paper, we illustrate the power of the squellar model, showing that the light
curve of the well-studied ""exoplanet"" WASP-12b can be reconstructed simply from
a rotating squar with proportions $1:1/8:1$, without invoking ad-hoc planetary
bodies. Our findings cast serious doubt on the validity of current
""exoplanetary"" efforts, which have largely ignored the potential role of squars
and have instead blindly accepted the exoplanet hypothesis without sufficient
critical scrutiny. In addition, we discuss the sociopolitical role of climate
change in spurring the current exoplanet fervor which has lead to the
speculative state of ""exoplanetary science"" today. We strongly urge the
astronomical community to take our model proposal seriously and treat its
severe ramifications with the utmost urgency to restore rationality to the
field of astronomy.

exchange-coupling between the metal and the insulator. The effective
electron-electron interaction between electrons in the normal metal, mediated
by antiferromagnetic magnons in the insulator, is derived to second order in
the interlayer exchange coupling, using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation.
Particular emphasis is placed on including analytically derived expressions for
the effective interactions including Umklapp processes in the solutions to the
superconducting gap equation. The gap equation is first solved at the critical
temperature as an eigenvalue problem by linearizing the gap equation. The
eigenvectors yield information on the symmetry of the superconducting gap at
the onset of superconductivity, and we derive a phase-diagram for the
order-parameter in this case. In the various regimes of the phase-diagram, we
find $p$-wave, $f$-wave, and $d$-wave superconductivity, with $p$-wave
superconductivity in the dominant part of the phase diagram. Umklapp processes,
that come into play with increasing size of the Fermi surface, yield $f$- and
$d$-wave symmetries as the preferred symmetries when band filling approaches
half-filling. To investigate the stability of this order parameter symmetry as
the temperature is lowered, we also consider the nonlinear gap equation at zero
temperature. We conclude that the phase diagram and the symmetries of the
superconducting order parameter essentially are left intact as the temperature
is lowered to zero temperature.

high-redshift galaxies in great detail, which must then be compared to models.
One significant source of uncertainty is in the stellar spectra used to
generate composite spectra of stellar populations, which are then compared to
data. Confidence in theoretical models is important to enable reliable
determination of the properties of these galaxies such as their ages and star
formation history. Here we present a comparison of spectral synthesis carried

typical observational uncertainties on individual galaxy observations.
Differences become more pronounced when detailed spectroscopic properties are
examined. Predictions for spectral line indices can vary significantly, with
equivalent widths differing by a factor of two in some cases. With these index
strengths, some of the libraries yield predictions of ages and metallicities
which are unphysical. Many spectral libraries lack wavelength coverage in the

chiral algebra. We establish a number of results pertaining to RCFTs in ""small""

  We start by completely solving the modular bootstrap problem for theories
with at most four primary operators. In particular, we characterize, and
provide an algorithm which efficiently computes, the function spaces to which
the partition function of any bosonic RCFT with $\mathrm{rank}(\mathscr{C})\leq

chiral versions of bosonization and fermionization, we obtain the complete list
of purely left-moving fermionic RCFTs with $c< 23$ as a corollary of the
results of the previous paragraph. Second, using a (conjectural) concept which

the SMEFT have been investigated and it has become a standard tool to analyze
experimental results in an integral way. In this article, after briefly
presenting the salient features of the Standard Model, we review the
construction of the SMEFT. We discuss the range of its applicability and bounds
on its coefficients imposed by general theoretical considerations. Since new
physics models are likely to exhibit exact or approximate accidental global
symmetries, especially in the flavor sector, we also discuss their implications
for the SMEFT. The main focus of our review is the phenomenological analysis of
experimental results. We show explicitly how to use various effective field
theories to study the phenomenology of theories beyond the Standard Model. We
give a detailed description of the matching procedure and the use of the
renormalization group equations, allowing to connect multiple effective
theories valid at different energy scales. Explicit examples from low-energy
experiments and from high-$p_T$ physics illustrate the workflow. We also
comment on the non-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking and
its phenomenological implications.

identify the energy source powering the LC. Nearly 50 epochs of high S/N-ratio

a SN IcBL, and one of the best-sampled SN datasets to date. The global spectral
appearance and evolution of SN~2022xxf points to typical SN Ic/IcBL, with broad
features (up to $\sim14000$ km~s$^{-1}$) and a gradual transition from the
photospheric to the nebular phase. However, narrow emission lines
(corresponding to $\sim1000-2500$ km~s$^{-1}$) are present from the time of the
second rise, suggesting slower-moving circumstellar material (CSM). These lines
are subtle, but some are readily noticeable at late times such as in Mg~I
$\lambda$5170 and [O~I] $\lambda$5577. Unusually, the near-infrared spectra
show narrow line peaks, especially among features formed by ions of O and Mg.
We infer the presence of CSM that is free of H and He. We propose that the
radiative energy from the ejecta-CSM interaction is a plausible explanation for
the second LC hump. This interaction scenario is supported by the color
evolution, which progresses to the blue as the light curve evolves along the
second hump, and the slow second rise and subsequent rapid LC drop. SN~2022xxf
may be related to an emerging number of CSM-interacting SNe Ic, which show
slow, peculiar LCs, blue colors, and subtle CSM interaction lines. The
progenitor stars of these SNe likely experienced an episode of mass loss

show that the mass of the molecular gas within a fixed radius (500 pc) from the
AGNs (M_mol ~ 10^7-10^8 M_sun) is correlated with the jet power estimated from
X-ray cavities (P_cav ~ 10^42-10^45 erg s^-1). More specifically, the power is
proportional to the average density of the circumnuclear gas. The mass
accretion rate of the circumnuclear gas \dot{M} also has a correlation with
P_cav. On the other hand, the continuum luminosities at ~ 1.4 GHz and ~ 100-300

gravitons or scalars. We then proceed to apply the boostless bootstrap rules to
operators that do not modify the power spectra. Towards the end, we give a
prescription that gives correlators for $\alpha$ vacua directly once we have
the correlator for the Bunch-Davies vacuum. This enables us to bypass
complicated in-in calculations for $\alpha$ vacua.

Universe. Their dynamics are dominated by dark matter (DM), which makes them
among the best targets for indirect DM searches. We analyze 12 years of data
collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) in the direction of 49
clusters of galaxies selected for their proximity to the Earth and their high
X-ray flux, which makes them the most promising targets. We first create
physically motivated models for the DM density around each cluster considering
different assumptions for the substructure distribution. Then we perform a
combined search for a $\gamma$-ray signal in the {\it Fermi}-LAT data between
500 MeV and 1 TeV. We find a signal of $\gamma$ rays potentially associated
with DM that is at a statistical significance of $2.5\sigma-3.0\sigma$ when
considering a slope for the subhalo mass distribution $\alpha=1.9$ and minimum
mass of $M_{\rm{min}}=10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$. The best-fit DM mass and
annihilation cross-sections for a $b\bar{b}$ annihilation channel are
$m_{\chi}=40-60$ GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = (2-4) \times 10^{-25}$
cm$^3$/s. When we consider $\alpha=2.0$ and $M_{\rm{min}}=10^{-9}$ $M_{\odot}$,
the best-fit of the cross section reduces to $\langle \sigma v \rangle = (4-10)
\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$/s. For both DM substructure models there is a tension
between the values of $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ that we find and the upper
limits obtained with the non-detection of a $\gamma$-ray flux from Milky Way
dwarf spheroidal galaxies. This signal is thus more likely associated with
$\gamma$ rays produced in the intracluster region by cosmic rays colliding with

criteria necessary to be classified as YHGs. In conjunction with their moderate
luminosities of \logl = 4.7-5.4 estimated from optical/infrared photometry, we
suggest instead that they are normal yellow supergiants (YSGs) with more modest
initial masses around 15-20 \msun. This adds additional support to the
hypothesis that Wd1 is a multi-age cluster with an older age than previously
assumed, and is not a $\sim$5 Myr old cluster caught at a very specific
transitional point when single-star evolution might yield Wolf-Rayet stars,
luminous blue variables (LBVs), RSGs, and YHGs in the same cluster.
Nevertheless, the population of YSGs in Wd1 is very unusual, with YSGs
outnumbering RSGs, but with both spanning a large luminosity range. Here, we
discuss evolutionary scenarios that might have led to the high fraction of
YSGs. The number of YSGs and their significant luminosity spread cannot be
explained by simple population synthesis models with single or binary stars.
Even with multiple ages or a large age spread, the high YSG/RSG ratio remains
problematic. We suggest instead that the objects may experience a prolonged YSG
phase due to evolution in triple systems.

negatively skewed, having a higher density of architectures in the upper-bound

aggregate routing patterns that are far from the societal optimum which could
be achieved by centrally controlling the users' choices. In this paper, we
design a fair incentive mechanism to steer the selfish behavior of the users to
align with the societally optimal aggregate routing. The proposed mechanism is
based on an artificial currency that cannot be traded or bought, but only spent
or received when traveling. Specifically, we consider a parallel-arc network
with a single origin and destination node within a repeated game setting
whereby each user chooses from one of the available arcs to reach their
destination on a daily basis. In this framework, taking faster routes comes at
a cost, whereas taking slower routes is incentivized by a reward. The users are
thus playing against their future selves when choosing their present actions.
To capture this complex behavior, we assume the users to be rational and to
minimize an urgency-weighted combination of their immediate and future
discomfort. To design the optimal pricing, we first derive a closed-form
expression for the best individual response strategy. Second, we formulate the
pricing design problem for each arc to achieve the societally optimal aggregate
flows, and reformulate it so that it can be solved with gradient-free
optimization methods. Our numerical simulations show that it is possible to
achieve a near-optimal routing whilst significantly reducing the users'
perceived discomfort when compared to a centralized optimal but urgency-unaware
policy.

Vehicle (CAV) to complete lane change maneuvers in mixed traffic. The
interaction between CAVs and Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) requires designing
the best possible response of a CAV to actions by its neighboring HDVs. This
interaction is formulated using a bilevel optimization setting with an
appropriate behavioral model for an HDV's. Then, an iterated best response
(IBR) method is used to determine a Nash equilibrium. However, we also show
that when a common and simple-to-detect condition applies, the optimal
lane-changing policy is in fact independent of HDV behavior with a CAV changing
lanes by cooperating with another CAV in the target lane and always merging
ahead of it. Thus, the dependence on the interaction between CAVs and HDVs may
be eliminated in such cases. Simulation results are included to show the
effectiveness of our controllers in terms of cost, safety guarantees, and
disruption to the traffic flow when uncontrollable HDVs are present.

  We provide an efficient translation from BDDL into QBF, encoding the

  To show the feasibility of such a generic approach, we use QBF solvers to

Boltzmann measure is calibrated through the hyper-parameters $\langle N\rangle$

understanding of how these relationships may change with the properties of

Performing a linear perturbation analysis on each model, we compute the
resonant gravitational-wave frequencies of the PNS, and we motivate a
time-agnostic method for identifying characteristic frequencies of the dominant
gravitational-wave emission. From this, we identify two characteristic
frequencies, of the early- and late-time signal, that measure the surface
gravity of the cold remnant neutron star, and simultaneously constrain the hot

and shaped this community's programs over the years. We discuss different
challenges that emerged in the process, look at ways this organization has
fallen short of operationalizing participatory and intersectional principles,
and then assess the organization's impact. Queer in AI provides important
lessons and insights for practitioners and theorists of participatory methods
broadly through its rejection of hierarchy in favor of decentralization,
success at building aid and programs by and for the queer community, and effort
to change actors and institutions outside of the queer community. Finally, we
theorize how communities like Queer in AI contribute to the participatory
design in AI more broadly by fostering cultures of participation in AI,
welcoming and empowering marginalized participants, critiquing poor or
exploitative participatory practices, and bringing participation to
institutions outside of individual research projects. Queer in AI's work serves
as a case study of grassroots activism and participatory methods within AI,
demonstrating the potential of community-led participatory methods and
intersectional praxis, while also providing challenges, case studies, and
nuanced insights to researchers developing and using participatory methods.

made it necessary to not only perform binary manipulation detection but also

passive for manipulation localization exhibit poor generalization performance
over unseen GMs and attribute modifications. To combat this issue, we propose a
proactive scheme for manipulation localization, termed MaLP. We encrypt the
real images by adding a learned template. If the image is manipulated by any
GM, this added protection from the template not only aids binary detection but
also helps in identifying the pixels modified by the GM. The template is
learned by leveraging local and global-level features estimated by a two-branch
architecture. We show that MaLP performs better than prior passive works. We
also show the generalizability of MaLP by testing on 22 different GMs,
providing a benchmark for future research on manipulation localization.
Finally, we show that MaLP can be used as a discriminator for improving the

obtained as part of the Galactic Center Orbits Initiative at Keck Observatory,
and has a limiting $K$'-band magnitude of 15.8, which is at least 4 magnitudes
deeper than previous spectroscopic searches for binaries at larger radii within
the central nuclear star cluster. From this primary dataset, over 600 new
radial velocities are extracted and reported, increasing by a factor of 3 the
number of such measurements. We find no significant periodic signals in our
sample of 28 stars, of which 16 are massive, young (main-sequence B) stars and
12 are low-mass, old (M and K giant) stars. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
derive upper limits on the intrinsic binary star fraction for the young star

The young star binary fraction is significantly lower than that observed in the

organic cations in hybrid organic/inorganic halide perovskites, affecting the
structural and electronic properties of the perovskites. However, the
properties and even the existence of HBs in these perovskites are not well
established. We investigate HBs in perovskites MAPbBr$_3$
(MA$^+$=CH$_3$NH$_3^+$), FAPbI$_3$ (FA$^+$= CH(NH$_2$)$_2^+$), and their solid
solution (FAPbI$_3$)$_{7/8}$(MAPbBr$_3$)$_{1/8}$, using ab initio molecular
dynamics and electronic structure calculations. We consider HBs donated by X-H
fragments (X=N, C) of the organic cations and accepted by the halides (Y=Br,
I), and characterize their properties based on pair distribution functions and
on a combined distribution function of hydrogen-acceptor distance with
donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle. By analyzing these functions, we establish
geometric criteria for HB existence based on hydrogen-acceptor distance
$d(H-Y)$ and donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle $\measuredangle(X-H-Y)$. The
distance condition is defined as $d(H-Y)<0.3$ nm, for N-H-donated HBs, and
$d(H-Y)<0.4$ nm for C-H-donated HBs. The angular condition is
$135{^\circ}\le\measuredangle(X-H-Y)\le 180{^\circ}$ for both types of HBs. At
the simulated temperature (350 K), the HBs dynamically break and form. We
compute time correlation functions of HB existence and HB lifetimes, which
range between 0.1 and 0.3 picoseconds at that temperature. The analysis of HB
lifetimes indicates that N-H--Br bonds are relatively stronger than N-H--I
bonds, while C-H--Y bonds are weaker. To evaluate the impact of HBs on
vibrational spectra, we present the power spectra, showing that peaks
associated with N-H stretching modes in perovskites are redshifted and
asymmetrically deformed compared with the peaks of isolated cations.

algorithms for finding sparse solutions to ill-posed inverse problems. The
models comprise typically a conditionally Gaussian prior model for the unknown,
augmented by a hyperprior model for the variances. A widely used choice for the
hyperprior is a member of the family of generalized gamma distributions. Most
of the work in the literature has concentrated on numerical approximation of
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates, and less attention has been paid on
sampling methods or other means for uncertainty quantification. Sampling from
the hierarchical models is challenging mainly for two reasons: The hierarchical
models are typically high-dimensional, thus suffering from the curse of
dimensionality, and the strong correlation between the unknown of interest and
its variance can make sampling rather inefficient. This work addresses mainly
the first one of these obstacles. By using a novel reparametrization, it is
shown how the posterior distribution can be transformed into one dominated by a
Gaussian white noise, allowing sampling by using the preconditioned
Crank-Nicholson (pCN) scheme that has been shown to be efficient for sampling
from distributions dominated by a Gaussian component. Furthermore, a novel idea
for speeding up the pCN in a special case is developed, and the question of how
strongly the hierarchical models are concentrated on sparse solutions is
addressed in light of a computed example.

parameterized measure by using both similar and dissimilar examples. We perform
an extensive experimental evaluation of our method, with both language and
vision models, on the standard layer prediction benchmark and two new
benchmarks that we introduce: the multilingual benchmark and the image-caption
benchmark. In all cases, ContraSim achieves much higher accuracy than previous
similarity measures, even when presented with challenging examples. Finally,
ContraSim is more suitable for the analysis of neural networks, revealing new
insights not captured by previous measures.

One fundamental aspect of such states is the ordering of the various flavours -
such as spin or valley - that the electrons can undergo and the excitation
spectrum of the broken symmetry states that they form. These properties cannot
be probed directly with electrical transport measurements. The zeroth Landau
level of monolayer graphene with four-fold spin-valley degeneracy is a model
system for such investigations, but the nature of its broken symmetry states -
particularly at partial fillings - is still not understood. Here we demonstrate
a non-invasive spectroscopic technique with a scanning tunneling microscope and
use it to perform measurements of the valley polarization of the electronic
wavefunctions and their excitation spectrum in the partially filled zeroth
Landau level of graphene. We can extract information such as the strength of
Haldane pseudopotentials that characterize the repulsive interactions
underlying the fractional quantum states. Our experiments also demonstrate that
fractional quantum Hall phases are built upon broken symmetry states that
persist at partial filling. Our experimental approach quantifies the valley
phase diagram of the partially filled Landau level as a model flat band
platform which is applicable to other graphene-based electronic systems.

high-throughput absorption spectra across ~18,000 semiconductors, showing that

Next, we demonstrate that compounds with highly localized band edge states are
more likely to present forbidden transitions. Lastly, we search this set for
p-type and n-type TCs with forbidden or weak transitions. Defect calculations
yield unexplored TC candidates such as ambipolar BeSiP2, Zr2SN2 and KSe, p-type

Nonlinear dynamical systems often hide their secrets and the ultimate resource
is the numerical simulations of the equations. This paper presents a method to
explore bifurcations by using the basin entropy. This measure of the
unpredictability can detect transformations of phase space structures as a
parameter evolves. We present several examples where the bifurcations in the
parameter space have a quantitative effect on the basin entropy. Moreover, some
transformations, such as the basin boundary metamorphoses, can be identified
with the basin entropy but are not reflected in the bifurcation diagram. The

implications of the hardness of learning in bandits and reinforcement learning
(RL). In particular, Du et al. (2020) show that even if a learner is given
linear features in $\mathbb{R}^d$ that approximate the rewards in a bandit or
RL with a uniform error of $\varepsilon$, searching for an
$O(\varepsilon)$-optimal action requires pulling at least $\Omega(\exp(d))$
queries. Furthermore, Lattimore et al. (2020) show that a degraded
$O(\varepsilon\sqrt{d})$-optimal solution can be learned within
$\operatorname{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ queries. Yet it is unknown whether a
structural assumption on the ground-truth parameter, such as sparsity, could
break the $\varepsilon\sqrt{d}$ barrier. In this paper, we address this
question by showing that algorithms can obtain $O(\varepsilon)$-optimal actions
by querying $O(\varepsilon^{-s}d^s)$ actions, where $s$ is the sparsity
parameter, removing the $\exp(d)$-dependence. We then establish
information-theoretical lower bounds, i.e., $\Omega(\exp(s))$, to show that our
upper bound on sample complexity is nearly tight if one demands an error $
O(s^{\delta}\varepsilon)$ for $0<\delta<1$. For $\delta\geq 1$, we further show
that $\operatorname{poly}(s/\varepsilon)$ queries are possible when the linear
features are ""good"" and even in general settings. These results provide a
nearly complete picture of how sparsity can help in misspecified bandit
learning and provide a deeper understanding of when linear features are
""useful"" for bandit and reinforcement learning with misspecification.

sparsity has attracted great attention in the deep learning community. While
much success has been achieved in reducing FLOP and parameter counts while
maintaining acceptable task performance, achieving actual speed improvements
has typically been much more difficult, particularly on general purpose
accelerators (GPAs) such as NVIDIA GPUs using low precision number formats. In
this work we introduce PopSparse, a library that enables fast sparse operations
on Graphcore IPUs by leveraging both the unique hardware characteristics of
IPUs as well as any block structure defined in the data. We target two
different types of sparsity: static, where the sparsity pattern is fixed at
compile-time; and dynamic, where it can change each time the model is run. We
present benchmark results for matrix multiplication for both of these modes on
IPU with a range of block sizes, matrix sizes and densities. Results indicate
that the PopSparse implementations are faster than dense matrix multiplications
on IPU at a range of sparsity levels with large matrix size and block size.
Furthermore, static sparsity in general outperforms dynamic sparsity. While
previous work on GPAs has shown speedups only for very high sparsity (typically
99\% and above), the present work demonstrates that our static sparse
implementation outperforms equivalent dense calculations in FP16 at lower
sparsity (around 90%). IPU code is available to view and run at
ipu.dev/sparsity-benchmarks, GPU code will be made available shortly.

  parameter fitting in the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment","26 pages, 21 figures",,,"FERMILAB-PUB-23-132-CSAID-LBNF-ND-T","hep-ex hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A primary goal of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is
to measure the $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV neutrinos produced by a Galactic
core-collapse supernova if one should occur during the lifetime of the
experiment. The liquid-argon-based detectors planned for DUNE are expected to
be uniquely sensitive to the $\nu_e$ component of the supernova flux, enabling
a wide variety of physics and astrophysics measurements. A key requirement for
a correct interpretation of these measurements is a good understanding of the
energy-dependent total cross section $\sigma(E_\nu)$ for charged-current
$\nu_e$ absorption on argon. In the context of a simulated extraction of
supernova $\nu_e$ spectral parameters from a toy analysis, we investigate the
impact of $\sigma(E_\nu)$ modeling uncertainties on DUNE's supernova neutrino
physics sensitivity for the first time. We find that the currently large
theoretical uncertainties on $\sigma(E_\nu)$ must be substantially reduced
before the $\nu_e$ flux parameters can be extracted reliably: in the absence of
external constraints, a measurement of the integrated neutrino luminosity with
less than 10\% bias with DUNE requires $\sigma(E_\nu)$ to be known to about 5%.
The neutrino spectral shape parameters can be known to better than 10% for a
20% uncertainty on the cross-section scale, although they will be sensitive to
uncertainties on the shape of $\sigma(E_\nu)$. A direct measurement of
low-energy $\nu_e$-argon scattering would be invaluable for improving the
theoretical precision to the needed level.

applications including magnetic memories, spintronic sensors, and

structure-magnetism relations. Here we report on the MA that emerges in 10% Ru

perpendicular magnetization and anisotropic in-plane magnetization are found.
These moderately compressively strained films possess a rich microstructure,
consisting of coherently strained phase which evolves into a one dimensional
(1D) periodically-modulated structure above a critical thickness. We illustrate
how 10% Ru substitution plays a crucial role behind the observed MA, and how
the structural distortion and 1D periodic structural modulation produce the
anisotropic in-plane magnetization. We highlight the practical significance of
the observed MA, which could pave the way towards the realization of
cutting-edge oxide-based room temperature spintronic memory devices.

With the advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)-based methods, I2I
methods enabled the generation of artificial images that are indistinguishable
from natural images. Recently, I2I methods were also employed in histopathology
for generating artificial images of in silico stained tissues from a different
type of staining. We refer to this process as stain transfer. The number of I2I
variants is constantly increasing, which makes a well justified choice of the
most suitable I2I methods for stain transfer challenging. In our work, we
compare twelve stain transfer approaches, three of which are based on
traditional and nine on GAN-based image processing methods. The analysis relies
on complementary quantitative measures for the quality of image translation,
the assessment of the suitability for deep learning-based tissue grading, and
the visual evaluation by pathologists. Our study highlights the strengths and
weaknesses of the stain transfer approaches, thereby allowing a rational choice
of the underlying I2I algorithms. Code, data, and trained models for stain

improving imitation-learned models in a semantically aware fashion by
leveraging specification-guided sampling techniques as a means of aggregating
expert data in new environments. Specifically, we create a set of formal
specifications as a means of partitioning the space of possible environments
into semantically similar regions, and identify elements of this partition
where our learned imitation behaves most differently from the expert. We then
aggregate expert data on environments in these identified regions, leading to
more accurate imitation of the expert's behavior semantics. We instantiate our
approach in a series of experiments in the CARLA driving simulator, and
demonstrate that our approach leads to models that are more accurate than those
learned with other environment sampling methods.

  Technologies in Non-Cooperative Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Operating securely over 5G (and legacy) infrastructure is a challenge. In
non-cooperative networks, malicious actors may try to decipher, block encrypted
messages, or specifically jam wireless radio systems. Such activities can
disrupt operations, from causing minor inconvenience, through to fully
paralyzing the functionality of critical infrastructure. While technological
mitigation measures do exist, there are very few methods capable of assessing
the socio-economic impacts from different mitigation strategies. This leads to
a lack of robust evidence to inform cost-benefit analysis, and thus support
decision makers in industry and government. Consequently, this paper presents
two open-source simulation models for assessing the socio-economic impacts of
operating in untrusted non-cooperative networks. The first focuses on using
multiple non-cooperative networks to transmit a message. The second model
simulates a case where a message is converted into alternative plain language
to avoid detection, separated into different portions and then transmitted over
multiple non-cooperative networks. A probabilistic simulation of the two models
is performed for a 15 km by 15 km spatial grid with 5 untrusted non-cooperative
networks and intercepting agents. The results are used to estimate economic
losses for private, commercial, government and military sectors. The highest
probabilistic total losses for military applications include US$300, US$150,
and US$75, incurred for a 1, 3 and 5 site multi-transmission approach,
respectively, for non-cooperative networks when considering 1,000 texts being

that maps from coordinates (e.g., xyz) to signals (e.g., signed distances),
have shown remarkable promise as a high-fidelity and compact representation.
However, the lack of a regular and explicit grid structure also makes it
challenging to apply generative modeling directly on implicit neural fields in
order to synthesize new data. To this end, we propose HyperDiffusion, a novel
approach for unconditional generative modeling of implicit neural fields.
HyperDiffusion operates directly on MLP weights and generates new neural
implicit fields encoded by synthesized MLP parameters. Specifically, a
collection of MLPs is first optimized to faithfully represent individual data
samples. Subsequently, a diffusion process is trained in this MLP weight space
to model the underlying distribution of neural implicit fields. HyperDiffusion
enables diffusion modeling over a implicit, compact, and yet high-fidelity
representation of complex signals across 3D shapes and 4D mesh animations
within one single unified framework.

finite volume and conservative finite difference schemes and dynamic mesh

refinement (AMR), parallel computation, and load balancing. This framework is
tested through the development of the runaway electron solver that is able to
dynamically capture both bulk Maxwellian at the low-energy region and a runaway
tail at the high-energy region. To effectively capture features via the AMR
algorithm, a new AMR indicator prediction strategy is proposed that is
performed alongside the implicit time evolution of the solution. This strategy
is complemented by the introduction of computationally cheap feature-based AMR
indicators that are analyzed theoretically. Numerical results quantify the
advantages of the prediction strategy in better capturing features compared
with nonpredictive strategies; and we demonstrate trade-offs regarding
computational costs. The full solver is further verified through several
benchmark problems including manufactured solutions and solutions of physics
models. We particularly focus on demonstrating the advantages of using implicit

qualitatively different dynamics of the controlled system. Hence, a state
feedback controller design with four small controller coefficients is proposed
for an efficient and full singular symmetry-breaking control. Our approach
works well for nonlinear control systems with both controllable and
uncontrollable linearizations. Origin is a primary equilibrium for the
uncontrolled system. This gives rise to two secondary local equilibria for the
controlled system. These equilibria further experience tertiary fold and
hysteresis type bifurcations. The secondary and primary equilibria experience
Hopf and Bautin bifurcations leading to the appearance of one limit cycle from
primary equilibrium, and either one or two from each secondary equilibria. The
collisions of limit cycles with equilibria lead to either a heteroclinic cycle
or four different homoclinic cycles. Each pair of limit cycles may respectively
merge together and disappear. This is a saddle-node bifurcation of limit
cycles. Different combinations of these give rise to a rich list of bifurcation
scenarios. Finite determinacy of each of these bifurcations has been thoroughly
investigated. This greatly influences their stabilization potential in
applications. We consider Chua system with a quadratic state-feedback
controller. Controlled Chua system experiences a pitchfork bifurcation, three
Hopf bifurcations and two homoclinic bifurcations. There exist two different
regions of controller coefficient choices for feedback regularization and two
nearby regions for supercritical Hopf stabilization approach.

vehicle's future planning information. The EPG-MGCN first models the social
interactions by employing four graph topologies, i.e., distance graphs,
visibility graphs, planning graphs and category graphs. Then, the planning
information of the ego vehicle is encoded by both the planning graph and the
subsequent planning-guided prediction module to reduce uncertainty in the
trajectory prediction. Finally, a category-specific gated recurrent unit
(CS-GRU) encoder-decoder is designed to generate future trajectories for each
specific type of agents. Our network is evaluated on two real-world trajectory
datasets: ApolloScape and NGSIM. The experimental results show that the

difficulty in immersive shooting prevents designers to create satisfactory
outputs. In this work, we analyze the specific components that contribute to
cinematographic immersion considering spatial, emotional, and aesthetic level,
while these components are then combined into a high-level evaluation
mechanism. Guided by such a immersion mechanism, we propose a GAN-based camera
control system that is able to generate actor-driven camera movements in the 3D
virtual environment to obtain immersive film sequences. The proposed
encoder-decoder architecture in the generation flow transfers character motion
into camera trajectory conditioned on an emotion factor. This ensures spatial
and emotional immersion by performing actor-camera synchronization physically
and psychologically. The emotional immersion is further strengthened by
incorporating regularization that controls camera shakiness for expressing
different mental statuses. To achieve aesthetic immersion, we make effort to
improve aesthetic frame compositions by modifying the synthesized camera
trajectory. Based on a self-supervised adjustor, the adjusted camera placements
can project the character to the appropriate on-frame locations following
aesthetic rules. The experimental results indicate that our proposed camera
control system can efficiently offer immersive cinematic videos, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, based on a fine-grained immersive shooting.

privacy budget. This budget represents a maximal privacy violation that any

argue that this approach is limited because different users may have different
privacy expectations. Thus, setting a uniform privacy budget across all points
may be overly conservative for some users or, conversely, not sufficiently
protective for others. In this paper, we capture these preferences through
individualized privacy budgets. To demonstrate their practicality, we introduce
a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) which
supports such individualized budgets. DP-SGD is the canonical approach to
training models with differential privacy. We modify its data sampling and
gradient noising mechanisms to arrive at our approach, which we call
Individualized DP-SGD (IDP-SGD). Because IDP-SGD provides privacy guarantees
tailored to the preferences of individual users and their data points, we find
it empirically improves privacy-utility trade-offs.

like rice, sugar, or salt; the world is full of granular materials. Despite
impressive progress in robotic manipulation, manipulating and interacting with
granular material remains a challenge due to difficulties in perceiving,
representing, modelling, and planning for these variable materials that have
complex internal dynamics. While some prior work has looked into estimating or
learning accurate dynamics models for granular materials, the literature is
still missing a more abstract planning method that can be used for planning
manipulation actions for granular materials with unknown material properties.
In this work, we leverage tools from optimal transport and connect them to
robot motion planning. We propose a heuristics-based sweep planner that does
not require knowledge of the material's properties and directly uses a height
map representation to generate promising sweeps. These sweeps transform
granular material from arbitrary start shapes into arbitrary target shapes. We
apply the sweep planner in a fast and reactive feedback loop and avoid the need
for model-based planning over multiple time steps. We validate our approach
with a large set of simulation and hardware experiments where we show that our
method is capable of efficiently solving several complex tasks, including
gathering, separating, and shaping of several types of granular materials into
different target shapes.

introduced to make the algorithm capable of processing complex datasets

further applied a decision tree analysis algorithm to associate the input data

characterize different water access conditions in each cluster. Our results
complement experts' priority rankings of water infrastructure needs, providing
a more in-depth view of the water insecurity challenges that the Colonias

solution for conducting data-driven analysis to understand water access
inequality. This pipeline can be adapted to analyze different datasets and

exhibits no significant optical response, however, the CdS/LSMO
heterostructures show an enhanced conductivity, with ~ 37 % resistance drop, at

location of sound sources in a video. Previous single-source methods mainly
used the audio-visual association as clues to localize sounding objects in each
image. Due to the mixed property of multiple sound sources in the original
space, there exist rare multi-source approaches to localizing multiple sources
simultaneously, except for one recent work using a contrastive random walk in
the graph with images and separated sound as nodes. Despite their promising
performance, they can only handle a fixed number of sources, and they cannot
learn compact class-aware representations for individual sources. To alleviate
this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual grouping
network, namely AVGN, that can directly learn category-wise semantic features
for each source from the input audio mixture and image to localize multiple
sources simultaneously. Specifically, our AVGN leverages learnable audio-visual
class tokens to aggregate class-aware source features. Then, the aggregated
semantic features for each source can be used as guidance to localize the
corresponding visual regions. Compared to existing multi-source methods, our
new framework can localize a flexible number of sources and disentangle
category-aware audio-visual representations for individual sound sources. We
conduct extensive experiments on MUSIC, VGGSound-Instruments, and VGG-Sound
Sources benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed AVGN can achieve
state-of-the-art sounding object localization performance on both single-source

uses the weight of the UAV to wrap the claw around a perch, or hyperextend it
in the opposite direction to form a ball shape for stable terrestrial
locomotion. Because the design uses the weight of the vehicle, the
underactuated design is lightweight and low power. With the inclusion of
talons, the 45g claws are capable of holding a 700g UAV to an almost 20-degree
angle on a perch. In scenarios where cluttered environments impede flight and
long mission times are required, such a combination of flying, perching, and
walking is critical.

past HR have suffered a stubborn problem of over-entrainment due to an
uncontrolled source of mixing across the marine subtropical inversion
manifesting as stratocumulus dim biases in present-day climate, limiting their
scientific utility. We report new results showing that this over-entrainment
can be partly offset by using hyperviscosity and cloud droplet sedimentation.
Hyperviscosity damps small-scale momentum fluctuations associated with the
formulation of the momentum solver of the embedded LES. By considering the
sedimentation process adjacent to default one-moment microphysics in HR,
condensed phase particles can be removed from the entrainment zone, which
further reduces entrainment efficiency. The result is an HR that is able to
produce more low clouds with a higher liquid water path and a reduced
stratocumulus dim bias. Associated improvements in the explicitly simulated
sub-cloud eddy spectrum are observed. We report these sensitivities in
multi-week tests and then explore their operational potential alongside
microphysical retuning in decadal simulations at operational 1.5 degree
exterior resolution. The result is a new HR having desired improvements in the
baseline present-day low cloud climatology, and a reduced global mean bias and
root mean squared error of absorbed shortwave radiation. We suggest it should

network is subject to error or natural changes over time. This motivated a new
perspective on GSP, where the signal processing framework is developed for an
entire class of graphs with similar structures. This approach can be formalized
via the theory of graph limits, where graphs are considered as random samples
from a distribution represented by a graphon.
  When the network under consideration has underlying symmetries, they may be
modeled as samples from Cayley graphons. In Cayley graphons, vertices are
sampled from a group, and the link probability between two vertices is
determined by a function of the two corresponding group elements. Infinite
groups such as the 1-dimensional torus can be used to model networks with an
underlying spatial reality. Cayley graphons on finite groups give rise to a
Stochastic Block Model, where the link probabilities between blocks form a

based on a coherent and simultaneous determination of the reddening correction

UO22) reanalyzed the results of Galera-Rosillo et al. (2022, GR22) on nine of
the brightest planetary nebulae in M31. They claim that, if standard values of
the physical conditions are used to compute the extinction instead of their
proposed method, extinction correction is underestimated by more than 50% and
hence, ionic and elemental abundance determinations, especially the N/O ratio,
are incorrect. Several tests were performed to assess the accuracy of the
results of GR22, when determining: i) the extinction coefficient, ii) the
electron temperature and density, and iii) the ionic abundances. In the latter
case, N+ /H+ ionic abundance was recalculated using both H_alpha and H_beta as
the reference H I emissivity. The analysis shows that the errors introduced by
adopting standard values of the plasma conditions by GR22 are small, within
their quoted uncertainties. On the other hand, the interstellar extinction in
UO22 is found to be overestimated for five of the nine nebulae considered. This
propagates into their analysis of the properties of the nebulae and their
progenitors. The python notebook used to generate all the results presented in
this paper are of public access on a Github repository. The results from GR22
are proven valid and the conclusions of the paper hold firmly. Although the
PPAP is, in principle, a recommended practice, we insist that it is equally
important to critically assess which H I lines are to be included in the

these methods still face some challenges. Existing methods lack a direct
representation of depth information, which makes object reconstruction
unrestricted by geometric features, resulting in poor reconstruction of objects
with texture and color features. This is because existing methods only use
surface normals to represent implicit surfaces without using depth information.
Therefore, these methods cannot model the detailed surface features of objects
well. To address this problem, we propose a neural implicit surface learning
method called Depth-NeuS based on depth information optimization for multi-view
reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce depth loss to explicitly constrain
SDF regression and introduce geometric consistency loss to optimize for
low-texture areas. Specific experiments show that Depth-NeuS outperforms
existing technologies in multiple scenarios and achieves high-quality surface

primarily due to (i) over-relying on the multiview stereo (MVS) for geometric
scaffold recovery and (ii) assuming COLMAP computed camera poses as the best
possible estimates, despite it being well-studied that MVS 3D reconstruction
accuracy is limited to scene disparity and camera-pose accuracy is sensitive to
key-point correspondence selection. This work proposes a principled way to
enhance novel view synthesis solutions drawing inspiration from the basics of
multiple view geometry. By leveraging the complementary behavior of MVS and
monocular depth, we arrive at a better scene depth per view for nearby and far

image-based rendering via multiple rotation averaging graph optimization. The
recovered scene depth and the camera-pose help better view-dependent on-surface

additional parameters previously derived from stellar population synthesis

to their mass and mass-ratio distribution, their hitherto enigmatic small

between each coalescence, the typical rapid spin of the merged EBHs is
suppressed by their subsequent accretion of gas from a turbulent environment,
due to its ability to randomize the flow's spin orientation with respect to

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Task offloading is a widely used technology in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC),
which declines the completion time of user task with the help of resourceful
edge servers. Existing works mainly focus on the case that the computation
density of a user task is homogenous so that it can be offloaded in full or by
percentage. However, various user tasks in real life consist of several inner
dependent subtasks, each of which is a minimum execution unit logically.
Motivated by this gap, we aim to solve the Dependent Task Offloading (DTO)
problem under multi-user multi-edge scenario in this paper. We firstly use
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to represent dependent task where nodes indicate
subtasks and directed edges indicate dependencies among subtasks. Then we
propose a scheme based on Graph Attention Network (GAT) and Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) to minimize the makespan of user tasks. To utilize GAT
efficiently, we put the training of it on resourceful cloud in unsupervised
style due to the numerous data and computation resource requirements. In
addition, we design a multi-discrete Action space for DRL algorithm to enhance
the applicability of our proposed scheme. Experiments are conducted on broadly
distributed synthetic data. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach
can be adapted to both simple and complex MEC environments and outperforms
other methods.

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples at precision
$\varepsilon$ with a cost that is $m^2 d \log(1/\varepsilon)$ where $m$ is the

consists in: first, computing the PSD model that satisfies the Fokker-Planck
equation (or its fractional variant) associated with the SDE, up to error
$\varepsilon$, and then sampling from the resulting PSD model. Assuming some
regularity of the Fokker-Planck solution (i.e. $\beta$-times differentiability
plus some geometric condition on its zeros) We obtain an algorithm that: (a) in
the preparatory phase obtains a PSD model with L2 distance $\varepsilon$ from
the solution of the equation, with a model of dimension $m =
\varepsilon^{-(d+1)/(\beta-2s)} (\log(1/\varepsilon))^{d+1}$ where $1/2\leq
s\leq1$ is the fractional power to the Laplacian, and total computational
complexity of $O(m^{3.5} \log(1/\varepsilon))$ and then (b) for Fokker-Planck
equation, it is able to produce i.i.d.\ samples with error $\varepsilon$ in
Wasserstein-1 distance, with a cost that is $O(d \varepsilon^{-2(d+1)/\beta-2}
\log(1/\varepsilon)^{2d+3})$ per sample. This means that, if the probability
associated with the SDE is somewhat regular, i.e. $\beta \geq 4d+2$, then the
algorithm requires $O(\varepsilon^{-0.88} \log(1/\varepsilon)^{4.5d})$ in the
preparatory phase, and $O(\varepsilon^{-1/2}\log(1/\varepsilon)^{2d+2})$ for
each sample. Our results suggest that as the true solution gets smoother, we
can circumvent the curse of dimensionality without requiring any sort of

is trained to learn a semantically useful embedding space via ranking losses.
Traditionally, the effectiveness of a ranking loss depends on the minibatch
size, and is, therefore, inherently limited by the memory constraints of the
underlying hardware. While simply accumulating the embeddings across
minibatches has proved useful (Wang et al. [2020]), we show that it is equally
important to ensure that the accumulated embeddings are up to date. In
particular, it is necessary to circumvent the representational drift between
the accumulated embeddings and the feature embeddings at the current training
iteration as the learnable parameters are being updated. In this paper, we
model representational drift as distribution misalignment and tackle it using
moment matching. The result is a simple method for updating the stored
embeddings to match the first and second moments of the current embeddings at
each training iteration. Experiments on three popular image retrieval datasets,

freedom of lights, and such that various polarisation properties are coming
from macroscopic manifestation of quantum-mechanical properties of lights. An
orbital degree of freedom of lights is also manipulated to form a vortex of
lights with orbital angular momentum, which is also quantised. However, it is
considered that spin and orbital angular momentum of a photon cannot be split
from the total orbital angular momentum in a gauge-invariant way. Here, we
revisit this issue for a coherent monochromatic ray from a laser source,
propagating in a waveguide. We obtained the helical components of spin and
orbital angular momentum by the correspondence with the classical Ponyting
vector. By applying a standard quantum field theory using a coherent state, we
obtained the gauge-independent expressions of spin and orbital angular momentum
operators. During the derivations, it was essential to take a finite
cross-sectional area into account, which leads the finite longitudinal
component along the direction of the propagation, which allows the splitting.
Therefore, the finite mode profile was responsible to justify the splitting,
which was not possible as far as we are using plane-wave expansions in a
standard theory of quantum-electrodynamics (QED). Our results suggest spin and
orbital angular momentum are well-defined quantum-mechanical freedoms at least
for coherent photons propagating in a waveguide and in a vacuum with a finite

have a strong assumption that the source data is accessible during adaptation,
which may not be feasible in many real-world scenarios due to privacy concerns
and resource constraints of devices. In this regard, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) excels as access to source data is no longer required during
adaptation. Recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on SFDA mostly focus on
pseudo-label refinement based self-training which generally suffers from two
issues: i) inevitable occurrence of noisy pseudo-labels that could lead to
early training time memorization, ii) refinement process requires maintaining a
memory bank which creates a significant burden in resource constraint
scenarios. To address these concerns, we propose C-SFDA, a curriculum learning
aided self-training framework for SFDA that adapts efficiently and reliably to
changes across domains based on selective pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we
employ a curriculum learning scheme to promote learning from a restricted
amount of pseudo labels selected based on their reliabilities. This simple yet
effective step successfully prevents label noise propagation during different
stages of adaptation and eliminates the need for costly memory-bank based label
refinement. Our extensive experimental evaluations on both image recognition

  Representation Learning","Accepted by ICLR23",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contrastive learning methods train visual encoders by comparing views from
one instance to others. Typically, the views created from one instance are set
as positive, while views from other instances are negative. This binary
instance discrimination is studied extensively to improve feature
representations in self-supervised learning. In this paper, we rethink the
instance discrimination framework and find the binary instance labeling
insufficient to measure correlations between different samples. For an
intuitive example, given a random image instance, there may exist other images
in a mini-batch whose content meanings are the same (i.e., belonging to the
same category) or partially related (i.e., belonging to a similar category).
How to treat the images that correlate similarly to the current image instance
leaves an unexplored problem. We thus propose to support the current image by
exploring other correlated instances (i.e., soft neighbors). We first carefully
cultivate a candidate neighbor set, which will be further utilized to explore
the highly-correlated instances. A cross-attention module is then introduced to
predict the correlation score (denoted as positiveness) of other correlated
instances with respect to the current one. The positiveness score
quantitatively measures the positive support from each correlated instance, and
is encoded into the objective for pretext training. To this end, our proposed
method benefits in discriminating uncorrelated instances while absorbing
correlated instances for SSL. We evaluate our soft neighbor contrastive
learning method (SNCLR) on standard visual recognition benchmarks, including
image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The
state-of-the-art recognition performance shows that SNCLR is effective in
improving feature representations from both ViT and CNN encoders.

distributions of slender fibers and ramified particles settling in an isotropic
turbulent flow. The rotational dynamics of the particles is modeled using a
slender-body theory that includes the inertial torque due to sedimentation that
tends to rotate the particles toward a broadside orientation. The particles are
assumed to rotate due to viscous forces associated with the turbulent velocity
gradients occurring on the particle length scale. In the simulations, the
turbulence is obtained from a stochastic model of the velocity gradient in a
Lagrangian reference frame. In the experiments, the turbulence is generated by
active jets in a vertical water tunnel. It is well known that axisymmetric
particles rotate according to Jeffery's solution for the rotation of a
spheroidal particle if one adopts an appropriate effective aspect ratio. We
show that the same result applies to a ramified particle consisting of three
coplanar fibers connected with equal angles at a central point which rotates
like a thin oblate spheroid. The orientation statistics can be quantified with
a single non-dimensional parameter, the settling factor $S_F$, defined as the
ratio of rotations due to sedimentation and turbulent shear. For low values of
$S_F$, we observe nearly isotropically oriented particles, whereas particles
become strongly aligned near the horizontal plane for high values of $S_F$. The
variance of the angle away from horizontal scales as $S_F^{-2}$ for $S_F \gg
1$, but the orientation distribution is non-Gaussian due to turbulent
intermittency in this limit.

multifunctional properties have been studied comprehensively. As tann
increases, the rhombohedral perovskite structure of the LSCO becomes more
single-phase, whereas average particle size and dispersion grow. Co ions are in
mixed valence states, including major Co3+ and Co4+ components. It has been
found that the LSCO-900 shows two main Curie temperatures, TC1 and TC2,
associated with a particle size distribution. As an external hydrostatic
pressure P increases, average <TC1> and <TC2> increase from 253 and 175 K under

time, the antiferromagnetic temperature TAFM and blocking temperature TB also
increase from 145 and 169 K to 158 and 170 K, respectively. The increment of
<dTC/dP> for the smaller and bigger particles is sufficiently high and equals
10 and 13 K/GPa, respectively. The magnetocaloric effect in the LSCO-900
nanopowder is relatively weak but with an extremely wide peak > 50 K that makes
this composition interesting to be used as one of the components of the

has been crucial for developing various XC energy density functional
approximations and understanding their performance for real molecules and
materials. However, there are very few systems for which accurate XC holes have
been calculated, since this requires evaluating the one- and two-particle
reduced density matrices for a reference wave function over a range of
$\lambda$ whilst the electron density remains fixed at the physical
($\lambda=1$) density. Although the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD)
method can yield exact results for a two-electron system in the complete basis
set limit, it cannot capture the electron-electron cusp with commonly used
finite basis sets. In this study, focusing on the Hooke's atom as a
two-electron model system for which certain analytic solutions are known, we
examine the effect of this cusp error on the XC hole calculated using CCSD. The
Lieb functional is calculated at a range of coupling constants to determine the
$\lambda$-integrated XC hole. Our results indicate that, for the Hooke's atoms,
the error introduced by the description of the electron-electron cusp using
Gaussian basis sets at the CCSD level is negligible compared to the basis set
incompleteness error. The system-, angle- and coupling-constant-averaged XC
hole is calculated using the same approach and provides a benchmark against

electric potential is essential for petrophysical properties estimation and
flow behavior characterization. The governing physics of electrokinetic
transport is electromigration and electroosmotic flow, which depend on the
electric potential gradient, mineral occurrence, domain morphology, and
electrolyte properties. Herein, mineral occurrence and its associated zeta
potential are investigated for EK transport. The governing model includes three
coupled equations: (1) Poisson equation, (2) Nernst--Planck equation, and (3)
Navier--Stokes equation. These equations were solved using the lattice
Boltzmann method within X-ray computed microtomography images. The proposed
model is validated against COMSOL Multiphysics in a 2-dimensional microchannel
in terms of fluid flow behavior when the electrical double layer is both
resolvable and unresolvable. A more complex chalcopyrite-silica system is then
obtained by micro-CT scanning to evaluate the model performance. The effects of
mineral occurrence, zeta potential, and electric potential on the 3-dimensional
chalcopyrite-silica system were evaluated. Although the positive zeta potential
of chalcopyrite can induce a flow of ferric ion counter to the direction of
electromigration, the net effect is dependent on the occurrence of
chalcopyrite. However, the ion flux induced by electromigration was the
dominant transport mechanism, whereas advection induced by electroosmosis made
a lower contribution. Overall, a pore-scale EK model is proposed for direct
simulation on pore-scale images. The proposed model can be coupled with other
geochemical models for full physicochemical transport simulations.

models on class-labeled datasets. This comes with a downside, doing so limits
their expressive power: (i) supervised datasets are generally small compared to
large-scale scraped text-image datasets on which text-to-image models are
trained, and so the quality and diversity of generated images are severely

aggregated generative KD that mitigates the discriminator overfitting by
challenging the discriminator with harder learning tasks and distilling more

This implies that validation with more detailed experimental data that includes

contrast to gE-models and EOS, are capable of providing information about the
liquid structure and can predict dynamic properties although, the latter
quantities still show some imprecisions. Therefore, insights into the liquid

strategies in addition to a better understanding. Finally, the latest

disc center by targeting a quiet Sun area and an active region. We convolved
the original observations with Gaussian kernels to degrade their spectral
bandwidth and spatial resolution to the instrumental characteristics of the
most prominent series of \ca observations available to date. We then studied
the effect of data degradation on the observed regions and on parameters
derived from \ca line measurements that are largely employed as diagnostics of
the solar and stellar chromospheres. We find that the effect of degrading the
spectral resolution of \ca observations and line profiles depends on both the
employed bandwidth and observed solar region. Besides, we found that the
spatial degradation impacts the data characterized by a broad bandwidth to a
larger extent compared to those acquired with a narrow band. However, the
appearance of the observed solar regions is only slightly affected by the
spatial resolution of data with bandwidths up to 1 \AA \ and in the range

the latter is defined by different physical mechanisms. Thus, analytical

conventional approaches available in literature so far, accounting for carrier
number fluctuation (DN), mobility fluctuation (Dmu}) and contact resistance
(DR) effects based on the underlying physics that rules these devices. DN
mechanism due to trapping/detrapping together with an intense Coulomb
scattering effect, dominates 1/f noise from medium to strong accumulation

On this basis, we offer an explanation of why treating the salt diameter as a
free adjustable parameter blurs differences between electrolyte theories in the
calculation of mean ionic activity coefficients. Furthermore, a capacitor
circuit analogy with an approximation of the Dressed Ion Theory is applied to
develop a modified closest approach parameter ""b"" for the Pitzer-Debye-H\""uckel

and underscreening in the calculation of mean ionic activity coefficients. This
is achieved by defining ""b"" as a semi-empirical function that allows close

theory for high dielectric constant values and that lies close to recommended
literature values of ""b"" for low dielectric constant values. Finally, as proof
of principle, this modified semi-empirical Pitzer-Debye-H\""uckel term is
implemented in the predictive COSMO-RS-ES model, an own reimplementation of the
COSMO-RS theory developed for thermodynamic property calculations of
electrolyte systems. It is shown that the modified semi-empirical
Pitzer-Debye-H\""uckel term is an effective replacement for the recently
published version of COSMO-RS-ES with explicit considerations for ion pairing.
This reduces the modelling complexity by implicitly considering ion pairing and
improves overall qualitative performance for the prediction of salt

large pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. Current
state-of-the-art methods, like CoOp and ProDA, tend to adopt soft prompts to
learn an appropriate prompt for each specific task. Recent CoCoOp further
boosts the base-to-new generalization performance via an image-conditional
prompt. However, it directly fuses identical image semantics to prompts of
different labels and significantly weakens the discrimination among different
classes as shown in our experiments. Motivated by this observation, we first
propose a class-aware text prompt (CTP) to enrich generated prompts with
label-related image information. Unlike CoCoOp, CTP can effectively involve
image semantics and avoid introducing extra ambiguities into different prompts.
On the other hand, instead of reserving the complete image representations, we
propose text-guided feature tuning (TFT) to make the image branch attend to
class-related representation. A contrastive loss is employed to align such
augmented text and image representations on downstream tasks. In this way, the
image-to-text CTP and text-to-image TFT can be mutually promoted to enhance the
adaptation of VLMs for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms the existing methods by a significant margin.
Especially, compared to CoCoOp, we achieve an average improvement of 4.03% on
new classes and 3.19% on harmonic-mean over eleven classification benchmarks.

total intensity (scattered light and/or thermal emission) measurements.
Polarimetric observations have only been used sparingly to interpret the
composition, structure, and size of dust grains in these discs. Here we present
new multi-wavelength aperture polarisation observations with parts-per-million
sensitivity of a sample of twelve bright debris discs, spanning a broad range
of host star spectral types, and disc properties. These measurements were
mostly taken with the HIgh Precision Polarimetric Instrument on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. We combine these polarisation observations with the
known disc architectures and geometries of the discs to interpret the
measurements. We detect significant polarisation attributable to circumstellar
dust from HD 377 and HD 39060, and find tentative evidence for HD 188228 and HD

sources of the problems with using X-Fields in our application and propose
novel techniques to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we observe that
X-Fields struggles to implicitly interpolate the disparities for large baseline
cameras. Therefore, we propose multi-plane disparities to reduce the spatial
distance of the objects in the stereo views. Moreover, we propose non-uniform
time coordinates to handle the non-linear and sudden motion spikes in videos.
We additionally introduce several simple, but important, improvements over
X-Fields. We demonstrate that our approach is able to produce better results

epidemiology, genomics, environmental science, economics, visual sciences,
among others. Methodologies to perform inference on the number of clusters have
often been proved to be inconsistent, and introducing a dependence structure
among the clusters implies additional difficulties in the estimation process.
In a Bayesian setting, clustering is performed by considering the unknown
partition as a random object and define a prior distribution on it. This prior
distribution may be induced by models on the observations, or directly defined
for the partition. Several recent results, however, have shown the difficulties
in consistently estimating the number of clusters, and, therefore, the
partition. The problem itself of summarising the posterior distribution on the
partition remains open, given the large dimension of the partition space. This
work aims at reviewing the Bayesian approaches available in the literature to
perform clustering, presenting advantages and disadvantages of each of them in
order to suggest future lines of research.

number of extraordinary meetings of OPEC countries organised to announce a
change of oil production. In the period immediately following the global
financial crisis, the decrease in oil prices and oil and gas demand forced OPEC
countries to make frequent adjustments to the production of oil, while, since
the first quarter of 2010, the recovery led to more regular meetings, with only
three organised extraordinary meetings. We propose to use a copula model to
study how the dependence structure among energy prices changed among the two
periods. The use of copula models allows to introduce flexible and realistic
models for the marginal time series; once marginal parameters are estimated,
the estimates are used to fit several copula models for all asset combinations.
Model selection techniques based on information criteria are implemented to
choose the best models both for the univariate asset prices series and for the
distribution of co-movements. The changes in the dependence structure of couple
of assets are investigated through copula functionals and their uncertainty
estimated through a bootstrapping method. We find the strength of dependence
between asset combinations considerably differ between the two periods, showing
a significant decrease for all the pairs of assets.

that, when a perturbed system changes from integrable to chaotic, deviation of

of it, and 2) the method is ensemble-size agnostic in the sense that the number
of ensemble members in training and inference mode can differ. The PoET output

but with improved reliability. Performance assessments show that PoET can bring
up to 20% improvement in skill globally for 2m temperature and 2% for
precipitation forecasts and outperforms the simpler statistical
member-by-member method, used here as a competitive benchmark. PoET is also
applied to the ENS10 benchmark dataset for ensemble post-processing and
provides better results when compared to other deep learning solutions that are
evaluated for most parameters. Furthermore, because each ensemble member is

millions of kids daily. However, various studies have highlighted concerns
about the videos on the platform, like the over-presence of entertaining and
commercial content. YouTube recently proposed high-quality guidelines that
include `promoting learning' and proposed to use it in ranking channels.
However, the concept of learning is multi-faceted, and it can be difficult to
define and measure in the context of online videos. This research focuses on
learning in terms of what's taught in schools and proposes a way to measure the
academic quality of children's videos. Using a new dataset of questions and
answers from children's videos, we first show that a Reading Comprehension (RC)
model can estimate academic learning. Then, using a large dataset of middle
school textbook questions on diverse topics, we quantify the academic quality
of top channels as the number of children's textbook questions that an RC model
can correctly answer. By analyzing over 80,000 videos posted on the top 100
channels, we present the first thorough analysis of the academic quality of
channels on YTK.

and accurate solution for GNSS-denied environments. There is a significant
amount of previous research in terms of resilience of UWB ranging, with
non-line-of-sight and multipath detection methods. However, little attention
has been paid to resilience against disturbances in relative localization
systems involving multiple nodes. This paper presents an approach to detecting
range anomalies in UWB ranging measurements from the perspective of multi-robot
cooperative localization. We introduce an approach to exploiting redundancy for
relative localization in multi-robot systems, where the position of each node
is calculated using different subsets of available data. This enables us to
effectively identify nodes that present ranging anomalies and eliminate their
effect within the cooperative localization scheme. We analyze anomalies created
by timing errors in the ranging process, e.g., owing to malfunctioning
hardware. However, our method is generic and can be extended to other types of
ranging anomalies. Our approach results in a more resilient cooperative
localization framework with a negligible impact in terms of the computational
workload.

In this paper, we present a novel method named SARGAN that addresses the
above-mentioned limitations from three perspectives. First, we employed spatial
attention-based residual block instead of vanilla residual blocks to properly
capture the expression-related features to be changed while keeping the other
features unchanged. Second, we exploited a symmetric encoder-decoder network to
attend facial features at multiple scales. Third, we proposed to train the
complete network with a residual connection which relieves the generator of
pressure to generate the input face image thereby producing the desired
expression by directly feeding the input image towards the end of the
generator. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results show that our
proposed model performs significantly better than state-of-the-art methods. In
addition, existing models require much larger datasets for training but their
performance degrades on out-of-distribution images. In contrast, SARGAN can be
trained on smaller facial expressions datasets, which generalizes well on
out-of-distribution images including human photographs, portraits, avatars and
statues.

This breakthrough overcomes the fundamental limitations of both conventional
non-resonant approaches (bulky) and modern singly-resonant metasurfaces
(narrowband) for quadratic phase manipulations of electromagnetic signals. The
required non-uniform trains of resonances in the electric and magnetic sheet
conductivities that completely control phase delay, group delay, and chirp, are
rigorously derived and the limitations imposed by fundamental physical
constraints are thoroughly discussed. Subsequently, a practical, truncated
approximation by finite sequences of physically-realizable linear resonances is
constructed and the associated error is quantified. By appropriate spectral
ordering of the resonances, operation can be achieved either in transmission or
reflection mode, enabling full space coverage. The proposed concept is not
limited to dispersion compensation, but introduces a generic and powerful
ultrathin platform for the spatio-temporal control of broadband real-world
signals with a myriad of applications in modern optics, microwave photonics,
radar and communication systems.

frameworks for inferring relationships between neural firing and features of

represent spatial information through regularly repeating firing fields.
However, the influence of covariates may be masked in current statistical
models of grid cell activity, which by employing approaches such as
discretizing, aggregating and smoothing, are computationally inefficient and do
not account for the continuous nature of the physical world. These limitations
motivated us to develop likelihood-based procedures for modelling and
estimating the firing activity of grid cells conditionally on biologically
relevant covariates. Our approach models firing activity using Poisson point
processes with latent Gaussian effects, which accommodate persistent
inhomogeneous spatial-directional patterns and overdispersion. Inference is
performed in a fully Bayesian manner, which allows us to quantify uncertainty.
Applying these methods to experimental data, we provide evidence for temporal
and local head direction effects on grid firing. Our approaches offer a novel

to still obey the Heisenberg limit with respect to other relevant resources,

our setup is able to estimate a geometric phase associated to two sets of N

require a single-photon probe with an initial energy that is independent of N.
Using a superposition of causal orders outperforms every setup where the

implement other indicators to analyse their magnetic activity. In the present
work, we perform a comparative study between the best-known activity indicators
so far defined from the Ca II and H$\alpha$ lines to analyse M-dwarf stars. We
studied a sample of 29 M stars with different chromospheric activity levels and
spectral classes ranging from dM0 to dM6. To do so, we employed 1796 wide range
spectra from different instruments with a median time span of observations of
21 yr. In addition, we complemented our data with photometric observations from
the TESS space mission for better stellar characterisation and short-term
analysis. We obtained a good and significant correlation ($rho = 0.91$) between
the indexes defined from the two lines for the whole set of stars in the
sample. However, we found that there is a deviation for faster rotators (with
$P_{rot} < 4$ days) and higher flare activity (at least one flare per day).
There is an overall positive correlation between Ca II and H$\alpha$ emission
in dM stars, except during flare events. In particular, we found that
low-energy high-frequency flares could be responsible for the deviation in the
linear trend in fast-rotator M dwarfs. This implies that the rotation period

cold electrons from one to two increased the cold-electron current by at least
twofold. These results can be explained by a charging effect due to the Coulomb
interaction. This observation is an important step toward quantum manipulation
of flying single electrons in silicon.

explaining multi-output predictions has not yet been extensively addressed.
Methods that use Shapley values to attribute feature contributions to the
decision making are one of the most popular approaches to explain local
individual and global predictions. By considering each output separately in
multi-output tasks, these methods fail to provide complete feature
explanations. We propose Shapley Chains to overcome this issue by including
label interdependencies in the explanation design process. Shapley Chains
assign Shapley values as feature importance scores in multi-output
classification using classifier chains, by separating the direct and indirect
influence of these feature scores. Compared to existing methods, this approach
allows to attribute a more complete feature contribution to the predictions of
multi-output classification tasks. We provide a mechanism to distribute the
hidden contributions of the outputs with respect to a given chaining order of
these outputs. Moreover, we show how our approach can reveal indirect feature
contributions missed by existing approaches. Shapley Chains help to emphasize
the real learning factors in multi-output applications and allows a better
understanding of the flow of information through output interdependencies in
synthetic and real-world datasets.

multi-view data without label supervision. Multiple views provide more
information than single views and thus existing MvC methods can achieve
satisfactory performance. However, their performance might seriously degenerate
when the views are noisy in practical scenarios. In this paper, we first
formally investigate the drawback of noisy views and then propose a
theoretically grounded deep MvC method (namely MvCAN) to address this issue.
Specifically, we propose a novel MvC objective that enables un-shared
parameters and inconsistent clustering predictions across multiple views to
reduce the side effects of noisy views. Furthermore, a non-parametric iterative
process is designed to generate a robust learning target for mining multiple
views' useful information. Theoretical analysis reveals that MvCAN works by
achieving the multi-view consistency, complementarity, and noise robustness.
Finally, experiments on public datasets demonstrate that MvCAN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and is robust against the existence of noisy views.

further establish that both the rest-frame optical and near-infrared effective

greatly progressed through developing large and intricate deep learning models.
However, the lack of transparency is a big challenge that may not allow the
widespread adoption of these models. Explainable artificial intelligence is a
field of research where methods are developed to help users understand the
behavior, decision logics, and vulnerabilities of AI-based systems. Black-box
explanation refers to explaining decisions of an AI system without having
access to its internals. In this paper, we design and implement a black-box
explanation method named Black-box Object Detection Explanation by Masking
(BODEM) through adopting a new masking approach for AI-based object detection
systems. We propose local and distant masking to generate multiple versions of
an input image. Local masks are used to disturb pixels within a target object
to figure out how the object detector reacts to these changes, while distant
masks are used to assess how the detection model's decisions are affected by
disturbing pixels outside the object. A saliency map is then created by
estimating the importance of pixels through measuring the difference between
the detection output before and after masking. Finally, a heatmap is created
that visualizes how important pixels within the input image are to the detected
objects. The experimentations on various object detection datasets and models
showed that BODEM can be effectively used to explain the behavior of object
detectors and reveal their vulnerabilities. This makes BODEM suitable for
explaining and validating AI based object detection systems in black-box
software testing scenarios. Furthermore, we conducted data augmentation
experiments that showed local masks produced by BODEM can be used for further
training the object detectors and improve their detection accuracy and
robustness.

blending multiple exposures, the acquisition is often controlled so that the
dynamic range within one exposure is narrow. For HDR imaging in photon-limited
situations, the dynamic range can be enormous and the noise within one exposure
is spatially varying. Existing image denoising algorithms and HDR fusion
algorithms both fail to handle this situation, leading to severe limitations in
low-light HDR imaging. This paper presents two contributions. Firstly, we
identify the source of the problem. We find that the issue is associated with
the co-existence of (1) spatially varying signal-to-noise ratio, especially the
excessive noise due to very dark regions, and (2) a wide luminance range within
each exposure. We show that while the issue can be handled by a bank of
denoisers, the complexity is high. Secondly, we propose a new method called the
spatially varying high dynamic range (SV-HDR) fusion network to simultaneously
denoise and fuse images. We introduce a new exposure-shared block within our

lower level of geometric assumption on the boundary of the domain for the
global gradient estimate. More precisely, assuming that the nonlinearity of the
local operator, whose prototype is the classical $(-\Delta_p)^1$-Laplace
operator with $1<p<\infty$, is measurable in one variable and has a small BMO
assumption for the other variables, while the singular kernel associated with
the nonlocal $(-\Delta_q)^s$-Laplace operator with $0<s<1<q<\infty$ is merely
measurable, and that the boundary of the domain is sufficiently flat in
Reifenberg sense, we prove that the gradient of the solution is as integrable
as that of the associated non-homogeneous term in the divergence form.

violation, often claimed to be a probe of neutrino Majorana mass. However, it
could be triggered by new physics; after all, neutrino Majorana mass requires
physics beyond the Standard Model. If at least one electron were right-handed,
it would automatically signify new physics rather than neutrino mass. In case
both electrons were left-handed, the situation would become rather complicated,
and additional effort would be needed to untangle the source for this process.
We offer a comprehensive study of this issue from both the effective operator
approach and the possible UV completions, including the Pati-Salam quark-lepton
unification. While neutrino exchange is natural and physically preferred, our
findings show that new physics can still be responsible for the neutrinoless
double beta decay. In particular, the Pati-Salam theory can do the job,
consistently with all the phenomenological and unification constraints, as long
as the unification scale lies above 10^12 GeV, albeit at the price of

fundamental task in representation learning. Existing work on sequential
disentanglement mostly provides two factor representations, i.e., it separates
the data to time-varying and time-invariant factors. In contrast, we consider
multifactor disentanglement in which multiple (more than two) semantic
disentangled components are generated. Key to our approach is a strong
inductive bias where we assume that the underlying dynamics can be represented
linearly in the latent space. Under this assumption, it becomes natural to
exploit the recently introduced Koopman autoencoder models. However,
disentangled representations are not guaranteed in Koopman approaches, and thus
we propose a novel spectral loss term which leads to structured Koopman
matrices and disentanglement. Overall, we propose a simple and easy to code new
deep model that is fully unsupervised and it supports multifactor
disentanglement. We showcase new disentangling abilities such as swapping of
individual static factors between characters, and an incremental swap of
disentangled factors from the source to the target. Moreover, we evaluate our
method extensively on two factor standard benchmark tasks where we
significantly improve over competing unsupervised approaches, and we perform
competitively in comparison to weakly- and self-supervised state-of-the-art

data-points on human judgment and extrapolated data-points predicted by ETR,
with correct inference patterns as well as fallacies and framing effects (the

detected by using the newly developed module for a sensitive single pulse
search. Their small DM values suggest that they all are the Galactic RRATs.
More radio pulses have been detected from 26 transient radio sources but no
periods can be found due to a limited small number of pulses from all FAST
observations. The following-up observations show that 16 transient sources are
newly identified as being the prototypes of RRATs with a period already
determined from more detected sporadic pulses, 10 sources are extremely nulling
pulsars, and 24 sources are weak pulsars with sparse strong pulses. On the
other hand, 48 previously known RRATs have been detected by the FAST. Except
for 1 RRAT with four pulses detected in a session of five minute observation
and 4 RRATs with only one pulse detected in a session, sensitive FAST
observations reveal that 43 RRATs are just generally weak pulsars with sporadic
strong pulses or simply very nulling pulsars, so that the previously known
RRATs always have an extreme emission state together with a normal hardly
detectable weak emission state. This is echoed by the two normal pulsars
J1938+2213 and J1946+1449 with occasional brightening pulses. Though strong
pulses of RRATs are very outstanding in the energy distribution, their
polarization angle variations follow the polarization angle curve of the
averaged normal pulse profile, suggesting that the predominant sparse pulses of
RRATs are emitted in the same region with the same geometry as normal weak
pulsars.

to a complex and often highly branched RNA structure. While numerous studies
have demonstrated the functional importance of the high degree of RNA branching
-- for instance, for its spatial compactness or interaction with other
biological macromolecules -- RNA branching topology remains largely unexplored.
Here, we use the theory of randomly branching polymers to explore the scaling
properties of RNAs by mapping their secondary structures onto planar tree
graphs. Focusing on random RNA sequences of varying lengths, we determine the
two scaling exponents related to their topology of branching. Our results
indicate that ensembles of RNA secondary structures are characterized by
annealed random branching and scale similarly to self-avoiding trees in three
dimensions. We further show that the obtained scaling exponents are robust upon
changes in nucleotide composition, tree topology, and folding energy
parameters. Finally, in order to apply the theory of branching polymers to
biological RNAs, whose length cannot be arbitrarily varied, we demonstrate how
both scaling exponents can be obtained from the distributions of the related
topological quantities of individual RNA molecules with fixed length. In this
way, we establish a framework to study the branching properties of RNA and
compare them to other known classes of branched polymers. By understanding the
scaling properties of RNA related to its branching structure we aim to improve
our understanding of the underlying principles and open up the possibility to
design RNA sequences with desired topological properties.

flow from kilo-parsec to sub-parsec scales in both diffuse ISM and molecular
clouds. The determination of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and 3D
magnetic field properties in ISM is notoriously difficult. In this study, we
establish a statistical recipe `Y-parameter' based on the recent development of
turbulence statistical theory, namely the turbulence anisotropy analysis, to
reconstruct 3D magnetic fields in MHD simulations and understand the
mode-decomposition of MHD turbulence. In our analysis, we used 25 MHD
turbulence datacubes simulated using ZEUS-MP and Athena++ codes. We found that
the anisotropy of Stokes parameters can act as a diagnostic for retrieving the
magnetic field inclination in ISM and identifying dominating mode. It is
supported by the value space separation of the Y-parameter for decomposed
Alfvenic and compressible MHD cubes and which is decreasing and increasing with
mean field inclination angle, $\theta_{\lambda}$, respectively. In the total
cube analysis, Y$\sim 1.5$ (with Y$>1.5$ for A-mode and Y$<1.5$ for C-mode)
provides a statistical demarcation to obtain the dominant fraction of MHD
turbulence modes. Furthermore, we have found that the (i) if Y$\gtrsim 2.5$,
$10^\circ<\theta_{\lambda}< 30^\circ$ and A mode or $5^\circ<\theta_{\lambda}<
10^\circ$ and C-mode (ii) if Y$ \lesssim 1.0 $, $\theta_{\lambda} \lesssim

$40^\circ \lesssim \theta_{\lambda} \lesssim 60^\circ$ with A-mode or
$\theta_{\lambda} \gtrsim 70^\circ$ with C-mode, if Y-parameter is in the
intermediate range. As a consequence, in the future with the availability of
vast radio polarisation surveys, this technique can play a leading role in
detecting 3D magnetic field in ISM and characterizing the nature of the
interstellar turbulence.

find that electronic interactions alone can drive superconductivity in AB

good agreement with the experimentally observed ones, allowing us to further
predict superconductivity from electronic interactions in Bernal ABA trilayer

critical temperatures ($T_c$) of these five non-twisted graphene stacks, we
find that the ABC trilayer graphene possesses the highest $T_c\sim100$ mK.
After considering the enhancement of superconductivity due to Ising spin-orbit

in the critical temperature, increasing from 23 mK to 143 mK. The
superconducting behaviors in these non-twisted graphene stacks could be
explained by the order parameters (OPs). The OPs of Bernal stacks preserve
intravalley $C_3$ symmetry, whereas rhombohedral stacks break it. In all
stacks, the OPs have zeroes and change signs between valleys, which means that
these multilayers of graphene are nodal spin-triplet superconductors. Moreover,
dressing the purely electronic interaction with acoustic phonons, we observe
minor changes of the critical temperatures in these five stacks. We adopt the

Our approach thus offers easy implementation on top of existing code with

settings, we propose a 3D consistent patch attack by applying adversarial
patches in the 3D space to guarantee the spatiotemporal consistency, which is
more realistic for the scenario of autonomous driving. With substantial
experiments, we draw several findings: 1) BEV models tend to be more stable
than previous methods under different natural conditions and common corruptions
due to the expressive spatial representations; 2) BEV models are more
vulnerable to adversarial noises, mainly caused by the redundant BEV features;
3) Camera-LiDAR fusion models have superior performance under different

adversarial noises of both point cloud and image. These findings alert the

tool for ultrafast materials spectroscopy. At the forefront of these
advancements, several works proposed to use HHG as an all-optical probe for
topology of quantum matter by identifying its signatures in the emission
spectra. However, it remains unclear if such spectral signatures are indeed a
robust and general approach for probing topology. To address this point, we
perform here a fully ab-initio study of HHG from prototypical two-dimensional
topological insulators in the Kane-Mele quantum spin-Hall and anomalous-Hall
phases. We analyze the spectra and previously proposed topological signatures
by comparing HHG from the topological and trivial phases. We demonstrate and
provide detailed microscopic explanations of why in these systems none of the
thus far proposed observables uniquely and universally probe material topology.
Specifically, we find that the: (i) HHG helicity, (ii) anomalous HHG
ellipticity, (iii) HHG elliptical dichroism and (iv) temporal delays in HHG
emission, are all unreliable signatures of topological phases. Our results
suggest that extreme care must be taken when interpreting HHG spectra for
topological signatures, and that contributions from the crystal symmetries and
chemical nature might be dominant over those from topology. They hint that a
truly universal topological signature in nonlinear optics is unlikely, and
raise important questions regarding possible utilization and detection of
topology in systems out-of-equilibrium.

Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these

popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about
FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give
practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet

easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that
comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific
language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by
applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil/gas pipeline.

considering both channel attention and shifted-window-based self-attention

help of MAEIP pre-training, our proposed CSformer achieves state-of-the-art
performance on various image processing tasks, including Gaussian denoising,
real image denoising, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and

  with Exogenous Survival Probabilities",,,,,"cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  For many applications of agent-based models (ABMs), an agent's age influences
important decisions (e.g. their contribution to/withdrawal from pension funds,
their level of risk aversion in decision-making, etc.) and outcomes in their
life cycle (e.g. their susceptibility to disease). These considerations make it
crucial to accurately capture the age distribution of the population being
considered. Often, empirical survival probabilities cannot be used in ABMs to
generate the observed age structure due to discrepancies between samples or
models (between the ABM and the survival statistical model used to produce
empirical rates). In these cases, imputing empirical survival probabilities
will not generate the observed age structure of the population, and assumptions
such as exogenous agent inflows are necessary (but not necessarily empirically
valid). In this paper, we propose a method that allows for the preservation of
agent age-structure without the exogenous influx of agents, even when only a
subset of the population is being modelled. We demonstrate the flexibility and
accuracy of our methodology by performing simulations of several real-world age
distributions. This method is a useful tool for those developing ABMs across a
broad range of applications.

in a Be binary system. The field strength at the neutron star surface is not
known precisely, but indirect signs indicate a magnetic field above $10^{13}$
G, which makes the object one of the most magnetized known X-ray pulsars. Here
we present the results of observations X Persei performed with the Imaging
X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). The X-ray polarization signal was found to
be strongly dependent on the spin phase of the pulsar. The energy-averaged
polarization degree in 3-8 keV band varied from several to $\sim$20 per cent
over the pulse with a positive correlation with the pulsed X-ray flux. The
polarization angle shows significant variation and makes two complete
revolutions during the pulse period resulting in nearly nil pulse-phase
averaged polarization. Applying the rotating vector model to the IXPE data we
obtain the estimates for the rotation axis inclination and its position angle
on the sky as well as for the magnetic obliquity. The derived inclination is
close to the orbital inclination reported earlier for X Persei. The
polarimetric data imply a large angle between the rotation and magnetic dipole
axes, which is similar to the result reported recently for the X-ray pulsar GRO
J1008$-$57. After eliminating the effect of polarization angle rotation over
the pulsar phase using the best-fitting rotating vector model, the strong
dependence of the polarization degree with energy was discovered with its value
increasing from 0% at $\sim$2 keV to 30% at 8 keV.

accelerometers to measure step count at a very granular level, often in

period at baseline, and for one or more week-long follow-up periods after the
intervention. The data is usually aggregated to provide daily or weekly step
counts for the primary analysis. Missing data are common as participants may
not wear the device as per protocol. Approaches to handling missing data in the
literature have largely defined missingness on the day level using a threshold
on daily wear time, which leads to loss of information on the time of day when
data are missing. We propose an approach to identifying and classifying
missingness at the finer epoch-level, and then present two approaches to
handling missingness. Firstly, we present a parametric approach which takes
into account the number of missing epochs per day. Secondly, we describe a
non-parametric approach to Multiple Imputation (MI) where missing periods
during the day are replaced by donor data from the same person where possible,
or data from a different person who is matched on demographic and physical
activity-related variables. Our simulation studies comparing these approaches
in a number of settings show that the non-parametric approach leads to
estimates of the effect of treatment that are least biased while maintaining
small standard errors. We illustrate the application of these different MI
strategies to the analysis of the 2017 PACE-UP Trial. The proposed framework of
classifying missingness and applying MI at the epoch-level is likely to be
applicable to a number of different outcomes and data from other wearable

country to country. This variation coincides with significant socioeconomic
heterogeneity that complicates the design of effective non-pharmaceutical
interventions. This study examined how socioeconomic heterogeneity in selected
African countries might be factored in to explain better social contact mix
patterns between countries.
  Methods. We used a standardized contact matrix for 32 African countries,
estimated in [31]. We scaled the matrices using an epidemic model from [34]. We
also analyzed aggregated data from the World Bank country website. The data
includes 28 variables; social, economic, environmental, institutional,
governance, health and well-being, education, gender inequality, and other
development-related indicators describing countries. Principal components
analysis was used to visualize socioeconomic similarities between countries and
identify the indicators for maximum variation. The (2D)2 PC A approach was used
to reduce the dimension of the synthetic contact matrices for each country to
avoid the dimensionality curse. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was then
used to identify groups of countries with similar social patterns, taking into
account the countrys socioeconomic performance.
  Results. Our model yielded four meaningful clusters, each with a few
distinguishing features. Social contacts varied between groups but were
generally similar within each set. The countrys socioeconomic performance
influenced the clusters.
  Conclusions. Our results suggest that integrating socioeconomic factors into
social contacts can better explain infectious disease transmission dynamics and
that similar interventions can be implemented in countries within the cluster.

Prior works employ an encoder of transformer blocks to correlate the two-frame

cross-frame module, yielding less optimal performance. To resolve this, we
reformulate the MIM from reconstructing a single masked image to reconstructing
a pair of masked images, enabling the pretraining of transformer module.
Additionally, we incorporate a decoder into pretraining for improved upsampling

cross-frame global matching module (CFGM). Since the most textureless area is
planar surfaces, we propose a homography loss to further regularize its

  Advice complexity is a model in which an online algorithm has access to a
binary tape of infinite length, on which an oracle can encode information to
increase the performance of the algorithm. We are interested in the minimum
number of advice bits that are necessary and sufficient to solve a deletion
problem optimally.
  In this work, we first give essentially tight bounds on the advice complexity

consists of a single, arbitrary graph H. We then show that the gadget used to
prove these results can be utilized to give tight bounds in the case of node

high resistance and reduced degeneracy of the Fermi sea. We show that both

forms an intervalley coherent Fermi liquid. The exciton part of the system do
not contribute to the electrical current thus increasing the resistance. Within

in linearithmic time, and the best known approximation algorithms run in linear
time with an approximation factor smaller than two. All solutions have in
common that they select an optimal parenthesisation from a set of $C_{n-1}$
(Catalan number $n - 1$) distinct parenthesisations. We studied the set of
parenthesisations and discovered (a) that all of the exponentially many
parenthesisations are useful in the sense that they are optimal in an infinite
subset of the input space, (b) that only $n + 1$ parenthesisations are
essential in the sense that they are arbitrarily better than the second best on
an infinite subset of the input space, and (c) that the best essential
parenthesisation is never more than twice as costly as the best non-essential
parenthesisation. Through random sampling of the input space, we further
discovered that the set of essential parenthesisations includes an optimal
parenthesisation in the vast majority of inputs, and that the best essential
parenthesisation is on average much closer to optimal than the worst-case
bound. The results have direct consequences for the development of compilers

efficiently identified through matched filter searches, which match the data

different techniques for performing the matched filter, as well as generating
the template bank, exist, currently all modelled gravitational-wave searches
use templates that restrict the component spins to be aligned (or anti-aligned)
with the orbital angular momentum. This means that current searches are less
sensitive to gravitational-wave signals generated from binaries with generic
spins (precessing), suggesting that, potentially, a significant fraction of
signals may remain undetected. In this work we introduce a matched filter
search that is sensitive to signals generated from precessing binaries and can
realistically be used during a gravitational-wave observing run. We take
advantage of the fact that a gravitational-wave signal from a precessing binary
can be decomposed into a power series of five harmonics, to show that a
generic-spin template bank, which is only $\sim 3\times$ larger than existing
aligned-spin banks, is needed to increase our sensitive volume by $\sim 100\%$
for neutron star black hole binaries with total mass larger than $17.5\,
M_{\odot}$ and in-plane spins $>0.67$. In fact, our generic spin search
performs as well as existing aligned-spin searches for neutron star black hole
signals with insignificant in-plane spins, but improves sensitivity by
$\sim60\%$ on average across the full generic spin parameter space. We
anticipate that this improved technique will identify significantly more
gravitational-wave signals, and, ultimately, help shed light on the unknown

model-free run. Like rainfall, soil moisture also show intraseasonal
oscillation. Furthermore, the sub-seasonal and seasonal features of soil
moisture are different from each other. During the summer monsoon season, the
maximum soil moisture is found over western coastal regions, central parts of
India, and the northeastern Indian subcontinent. However, during active phases
of the monsoon, the maximum positive soil moisture anomaly was found in North
West parts of India. soil moisture also play a pre-conditioning role during
active phases of the monsoon over the monsoon core zone of India. When it is
further divided into two boxes, the north monsoon core zone, and the south
monsoon core zone, it is found that the preconditioning depends on that
region's soil type and climate classification. Also, we calculate the moist
static energy (MSE) budget during the monsoon phases to show how soil moisture
feedback affects the boundary layer MSE and rainfall. A similar analysis is
applied to the model run, but it cannot show the realistic preconditioning role
of soil moisture and its feedback on the rainfall as in observations. We
conclude that to get proper feedback between soil moisture and precipitation
during the active phase of the monsoon in the model, the pre-conditioning of

gravitational collapse of large density perturbations, generated by large
quantum fluctuations during inflation. Since PBHs form from rare
over-densities, their abundance is sensitive to the tail of the primordial
probability distribution function (PDF) of the perturbations. It is therefore
important to calculate the full PDF of the perturbations, which can be done
non-perturbatively using the 'stochastic inflation' framework. In single field
inflation models generating large enough perturbations to produce an
interesting abundance of PBHs requires violation of slow roll. It is therefore
necessary to extend the stochastic inflation formalism beyond slow roll. A
crucial ingredient for this are the stochastic noise matrix elements of the
inflaton potential. We carry out analytical and numerical calculations of these
matrix elements for a potential with a feature which violates slow roll and
produces large, potentially PBH generating, perturbations. We find that the
transition to an ultra slow-roll phase results in the momentum induced noise
terms becoming larger than the field noise whilst each of them falls
exponentially for a few e-folds. The noise terms then start rising with their
original order restored, before approaching constant values which depend on the
nature of the slow roll parameters in the post transition epoch. This will
significantly impact the quantum diffusion of the coarse-grained inflaton
field, and hence the PDF of the perturbations and the PBH mass fraction.

inspiration from human pushing actions and comprises two sub-problems, i.e.,
discrete decision-making of pushing point and continuous feedback control of
pushing action. In order to solve the sub-problems above, a combination of
Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method is
employed. Firstly, the selection of pushing point is modeled as a Markov
decision process,and an off-policy DRL method is used by reshaping the reward
function to train the decision-making model for selecting pushing point from a
pre-constructed set based on the current state. Secondly, a motion constraint
region (MCR) is constructed for the specific pushing point based on the
distance from the target, followed by utilizing the MPC controller to regulate
the motion of the object within the MCR towards the target pose. The trigger
condition for switching the pushing point occurs when the object reaches the
boundary of the MCR under the pushing action. Subsequently, the pushing point
and the controller are updated iteratively until the target pose is reached. We
conducted pushing experiments on four distinct object shapes in both simulated
and physical environments to evaluate our method. The results indicate that our
method achieves a significantly higher training efficiency, with a training
time that is only about 20% of the baseline method while maintaining around the

issue, we propose a postselection-based algorithm to efficiently prepare
resource states for gate teleportation. Our algorithm achieves fault tolerance,
demonstrating the exponential suppression of logical errors with code distance,
and it applies to any stabilizer codes. We provide analytical derivations and
numerical simulations of the fidelity and success probability of the algorithm.
We benchmark the method on surface code and show a factor of 100 to 10,000
reduction in space-time overhead compared to existing methods. Overall, our
approach presents a promising path to reducing the resource requirement for
quantum algorithms on error-corrected and noisy intermediate-scale quantum
computers.

antiferromagnetic ladder, featuring nearest neighbor hopping $t$ along the
ladders and Ising-type spin interactions along, $J_\parallel$, and across,
$J_\perp$, the ladder. We determine exact solutions for the low-energy one- and
two-hole eigenstates. The presence of the trans-leg spin coupling, $J_\perp$,
leads to a linear confining potential between the holes. As a result, holes on
separate legs feature a super-linear binding energy scaling as $(J_\perp /
t)^{2/3}$ in the strongly correlated regime of $J_\perp,J_\parallel \leq t$.
This behavior is linked to an emergent length scale $\lambda \propto
(t/J_\perp)^{1/3}$, stemming from the linear confining potential, and which
describes how the size of the two-hole molecular state diverges for
$J_\perp,J_\parallel \ll t$. On the contrary, holes on the same leg unbind at
sufficiently low spin couplings. This is a consequence of the altered
short-range boundary condition for holes on the same leg, yielding an effective
Pauli repulsion between them, limiting their kinetic energy and making binding
unfavorable. Finally, we determine the exact nonequilibrium quench dynamics
following the sudden immersion of initially localized nearest neigbhor holes.
The dynamics is characterized by a crossover from an initial ballistic quantum
walk to an aperiodic oscillatory motion around a finite average distance
between the holes due to the confining potential between them. In the strongly
correlated regime of low spin couplings, $J_\perp, J_\parallel \leq t$, we find
this asymptotic distance to diverge as $t / J_\perp$, showing a much stronger
scaling than the eigenstates. The predicted results should be amenable to
state-of-the-art quantum simulation experiments using currently implemented
experimental techniques.

$\alpha$ needs to be $\lesssim 10^{-8}\,m_{\rm Pl}^2$ to be consistent with

on the reheating temperature. Further, it implies an extremely small
tensor-to-scalar ratio that quantifies the amplitude of primordial

Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). This paper contains self consistent modeling of
both: accretion disk with optically thick corona, where the gas is heated by
magneto-rotational instability dynamo (MRI), and cooled by radiation which
undergoes free-free absorption and Compton scattering. Aims. We determine the
parameters of warm corona in AGN using disk-corona structure model that takes
into account magnetic and radiation pressure. We aim to show the role of
thermal instability (TI) as a constraint for warm, optically thick X-ray corona
in AGN. Methods. With the use of relaxation code, the vertical solution of the
disk driven by MRI together with radiative transfer in hydrostatic and
radiative equilibrium is calculated, which allows us to point out how TI
affects the corona for wide range of global parameters. Results. We show that
magnetic heating is strong enough to heat upper layers of the accretion disk
atmosphere, which form the warm corona covering the disk. Magnetic pressure
does not remove TI caused by radiative processes operating in X-ray emitting
plasma. TI disappears only in case of accretion rates higher than 0.2 of
Eddington, and high magnetic field parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$ > 0.1.
Conclusions. TI plays the major role in the formation of the warm corona above
magnetically driven accretion disk in AGN. The warm, Compton cooled corona,
responsible for soft X-ray excess, resulted from our model has typical
temperature in the range of 0.01 - 2 keV and optical depth even up to 50, which
agrees with recent observations.

the increasing business process models are usually owned by large enterprises.
In large enterprises, different stakeholders may modify the same business

adopt configurable business process models to manage process variants. However,
the process variants will vary with the change in enterprise business demands.
Therefore, it is necessary to explore the co-evolution of the process variants
so as to effectively manage the business process family. To this end, a novel
framework for co-evolution between business process variants through a
configurable process model is proposed in this work. First, the mapping
relationship between process variants and configurable models is standardized
in this study. A series of change operations and change propagation operations
between process variants and configurable models are further defined for
achieving propagation. Then, an overall algorithm is proposed for achieving
co-evolution of process variants. Next, a prototype is developed for managing
change synchronization between process variants and configurable process
models. Finally, the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed process
change propagation method are verified based on experiments on two business

the co-evolution of process variants with high accuracy and efficiency.

enables flexible and powerful interference management by splitting messages
into common parts and private parts to partially decode interference and
partially treat interference as noise. The RSMA-based CRC system thus
significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of
service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). However, the RSMA-based CRC system
raises new challenges. Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network
and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the
data rate of the CUs in the communication network. Therefore, a major problem
is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS
requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple

the common rate allocation to the CUs, transmit power of common messages and
transmit power of private messages of the CUs, and ii) transmit power of the

traditional novel category discovery (NCD) methods to be incapacitated for GCD,

effective way for GCD is applying self-supervised learning to learn
discriminate representation for unlabeled data. However, this manner largely
ignores underlying relationships between instances of the same concepts (e.g.,
class, super-class, and sub-class), which results in inferior representation
learning. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Conceptional Contrastive Learning

alternately estimating underlying visual conceptions and learning conceptional

multiple ""degenerate"" solutions to the problem. Degenerate solutions are all
equally valid given the information available, and thus render meaningless the

task. In particular, good approximations are lacking for models with recurrent
dynamics, in which variables can return to a previously visited state.
Recently, a scheme based on the cavity method with messages parametrized by
matrix product states [T. Barthel, C. De Bacco, and S. Franz, Physical Review E
97, 010104 (2018)] has been shown to work well for typical trajectories. In
this work, we build on this approach in two directions: first, we show how,
using a general formulation of the belief propagation equations instead of the
dynamical cavity method, it can be applied to Markov processes biased by
arbitrary reweighting factors that concentrate most of the probability mass on
rare events. Second, we introduce an efficient scheme to reduce the
computational cost of a single node update from exponential to polynomial in
the node degree, allowing to apply the method to graphs of large connectivity.
Two applications are considered. First, we compute individual infection
probabilities from sparse observations within the SIRS epidemic model (the risk

inferred about the gravitational potential from only 2D photometric data of a
stream. We present a fast method to infer halo shapes from the curvature of 2D
projected stream tracks. We show that the stream curvature vector must point
within 90 deg of the projected acceleration vector, in the absence of recent
time-dependent perturbations. While insensitive to the total magnitude of the
acceleration, and therefore the total mass, applying this constraint along a
stream can determine halo shape parameters and place limits on disk-to-halo
mass ratios. The most informative streams are those with sharp turns or flat
segments, since these streams sample a wide range of curvature vectors over a
small area (sharp turns) or have a vanishing projected acceleration component
(flat segments). We apply our method to low surface brightness imaging of NGC
5907, and find that its dark matter halo is oblate. Our analytic approach is
significantly faster than other stream modeling techniques, and indicates what

reduce the bandwidth and energy consumption, by allowing the users to transmit
their data simultaneously over a Multiple Access Channel (MAC). However, this
approach results in channel noise directly affecting the optimization
procedure, which may degrade the accuracy of the trained model. In this paper
we jointly exploit the prior distribution of local weights and the channel
distribution, and develop an OTA FL algorithm based on a Bayesian approach for
signal aggregation. Our proposed algorithm, dubbed Bayesian Air Aggregation
Federated learning (BAAF), is shown to effectively mitigate noise and fading
effects induced by the channel. To handle statistical heterogeneity of users

Bayesian approach to average the channel output, COBAAF controls the drift in
local updates using a judicious design of correction terms. We analyze the
convergence of the learned global model using BAAF and COBAAF in noisy and
heterogeneous environment, showing their ability to achieve a convergence rate
similar to that achieved over error-free channels. Simulation results
demonstrate the improved convergence of BAAF and COBAAF over existing

as a sum of three exponential decay components, where the impulsive component
contributes a fraction of 23\% of the total energy, while the gradual and the

The strong and variable Balmer narrow emission lines indicate the large

matroid'', a subsystem of which are the ``stalled'' sets closed under skew zero
forcing (SZF), a graph percolation/infection model known to have connections
with rank and nullity. For a wide variety of graphs, the lattice of SZF-closed
sets is also a matroid, a fact which can be used to obtain a polynomial-time
algorithm for computing the skew zero forcing number. This contrasts with the
general case, where we show that the corresponding decision problem is NP-hard.
We also define skew zero forcing for hypergraphs, and show that, for linear
hypertrees, the poset of SZF-closed sets is dual to the lattice of ideals of
the hypergraph's nullvariety; while, for complete hypergraphs, the SZF-closed
sets and the zero loci of nullvectors are more loosely related.

additional condition that the low-frequency part of the initial perturbation

optimal time-decay rates of the global solution toward the equilibrium state.

in terms of actions on spaces with measured walls in the sense of Cherix,
Martin and Valette [11]. Our proof is based on a new construction using
invariant point processes on such spaces with measured walls, which leads to
quantitative bounds on the two-point functions. These bounds yield in
particular exponential decay of the two-point function in several examples,
including co-compact Fuchsian groups and lamplighters over free groups.

we show that $\Gamma$ has property (T) if and only if there exists a threshold
$\alpha^*<1$ such that for every $\Gamma$-invariant bond percolation $\mathbb

implies that the two-point function is bounded away from zero. We extend this
result to the setting of {\em relative} property (T). We then use the
corresponding threshold to give a new proof of the fact, already observed by
Gaboriau and Tucker-Drob [21], that there is no unique infinite cluster at the
uniqueness threshold for Bernoulli bond percolation on Cayley graphs of groups

strategy of making more efforts but also a specialization strategy which allows
competitors to devote all their efforts to part of the competitive field. By
introducing the specialization strategy and benefiting from the existing model,
we simulate the evolution of the involution game on a square lattice under
different social resource, social temperature, effort and other conditions. In
addition, we also conduct an analytical analysis to further understand the
underlying mechanism of our model and to avoid illusive results caused by the
model settings. Our main results are that, if the total effort of the
specialization strategy and the ordinary strategy is equal, the group composed
of all the agents has a certain probability to choose the ordinary strategy at
the final state when the ratio of effort to social temperature is approaching
zero, otherwise the group will choose the specialization strategy; if the total
effort of the two strategy is not equal, the proportion of the specialization
strategy adoption are related to the social resource, the effort and the social
temperature. To some extent, our study can explain why division of labor

central finding is that in order to obtain the correct matching prescription
one has to take into account mixing of the hidden photon with the neutral
component of the weak $SU(2)_L$ bosons. This mixing is generated by a
dimension-six operator and, in theories where $SU(2)_L$ multiplets are charged
under the novel Abelian gauge group, is necessarily induced at the one-loop

mixing in $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$. Furthermore, we show how to obtain general
expressions for the Higgs decay amplitudes to two neutral vector bosons from
the vacuum polarisation amplitudes via the low-energy theorems. As an

extends a wide halo. Such a halo should be made of small grains produced in the
ring of parent bodies (PB) and pushed on high-e orbits by radiation pressure.
It has been shown that, under several simplifying assumptions, the surface
brightness (SB) of this halo should radially decrease as $r^{-3.5}$ in
scattered light. We aim to revisit the halo phenomenon and focus on two so far
unexplored issues: 1) How the unavoidable presence of small unbound grains,
non-isotropic scattering phase functions (SPF) and finite instrument resolution
affect scattered light SB profiles, and 2) How the halo phenomenon manifests
itself at longer wavelengths. We find that unbound grains account for a
significant fraction of the halo's luminosity in scattered light, and can
significantly flatten the SB radial profile. Realistic size-dependent SPFs also
have an effect, resulting here again in shallower SB profiles. For edge-on
discs, non-resolving the vertical profile can also flatten the projected SB. We
show that roughly half of the observationally-derived halo profiles found in
the literature are compatible with our new results, and that roughly half of
the remaining systems are probably shaped by additional processes. We also
propose that, in future observational studies, the characteristics of PB belt
and halos should be fitted separately. In thermal emission, wide halos should
remain detectable up to the far-IR and, with the exception of the $\sim
8-15\mu$m domain, the halo accounts for more than half of the system's total
flux up to $\lambda\sim80-90\mu$m. The halo's contribution strongly decreases
in the sub-mm to mm but still represents a few percents of the system's
luminosity at $\lambda\sim 1$mm. For unresolved systems, the presence of a halo
can also affect the determination of the disc's radius from its SED.

well-known results of Benjamini-Schramm local weak convergence is that of the
inhomogeneous random graph $IRG_n(\kappa)$ on $n$ vertices with connection
kernel $\kappa$. When the kernel satisfies the mild technical condition of
being a graphical kernel, the $IRG_n(\kappa)$ converges locally in probability
to the (unimodular) multi-type (marked) Poisson-Galton-Watson tree
$MPGW(\kappa)$. We extend this to dynamical settings, by introducing the

critical in Genetic Programming. Several approaches have been proposed to
achieve this, with some focusing on the mating phase from coupling dissimilar
solutions to some form of self-adaptive selection mechanism. In nature, genetic
diversity can be the consequence of many different factors, but when
considering reproduction Sexual Selection can have an impact on promoting
variety within a species. Specifically, Mate Choice often results in different
selective pressures between sexes, which in turn may trigger evolutionary
differences among them. Although some mechanisms of Sexual Selection have been
applied to Genetic Programming in the past, the literature is scarce when it
comes to mate choice. Recently, a way of modelling mating preferences by ideal
mate representations was proposed, achieving good results when compared to a
standard approach. These mating preferences evolve freely in a self-adaptive
fashion, creating an evolutionary driving force of its own alongside fitness
pressure. The inner mechanisms of this approach operate from personal choice,
as each individual has its own representation of a perfect mate which affects
the mate to be selected. In this paper, we compare this method against a random
mate choice to assess whether there are advantages in evolving personal
preferences. We conducted experiments using three symbolic regression problems
and different mutation rates. The results show that self-adaptive mating
preferences are able to create a more diverse set of solutions when compared to
the traditional approach and a random mate approach (with statistically
significant differences) and have a higher success rate in three of the six
instances tested.

mechanism in tidal disruption events (TDEs). We perform local three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamic simulations in a wedge geometry including the gravity to
study stream self-crossing, with emphasis on resolving the collision and
following the subsequent outflow. We find that the collision can contribute to
pre-peak optical emissions by converting $\gtrsim5\%$ of stream kinetic energy
to radiation, yielding prompt emission of $\sim10^{42-44}\rm erg~s^{-1}$. The
radiative efficiency is sensitive to stream mass fallback rates, and strongly
depends on the downstream gas optical depth. Even for a sub-Eddington ($10\%$)
mass fallback rate, the strong radiation pressure produced in the collision can
form a local super-Eddington region near the collision site, where a fast,
aspherical outflow is launched. Higher mass fallback rate usually leads to more
optically-thick outflow and lower net radiative efficiency. For
$\dot{M}\gtrsim0.1\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the estimated photosphere size of the
outflow can expand by one to two orders of magnitudes reaching $\sim10^{14}\rm
cm$. The average gas temperature at this photospheric surface is a few
$\times10^{4}$K, roughly consistent with inferred pre-peak photosphere
properties for some optical TDEs. We find that the dynamics is sensitive to
collision angle and collision radius, but the radiative efficiency or outflow
properties show more complex dependency than is often assumed in ballistic

solving the ``puzzle of polyominoes"". With this method, we are able to
rigorously study statistical properties of the high dimensional random tensor

law, except for a small probability that is bounded by an inverse polynomial of
the bond dimension; (b) the typicality occurs for the expectation value of a
local observable when the bond dimension increases. In addition, we investigate
the barren plateaus (i.e., exponentially vanishing gradients) for the
high-dimensional tensor network models. We prove that such variational models
suffer from barren plateaus for global loss functions, rendering their training
processes inefficient in general. Whereas, for local loss functions, we prove
that the gradient is independent of the system size (thus no barren plateau
occurs), but decays exponentially with the distance between the region where
the local observable acts and the site that hosts the derivative parameter. Our
results uncover in a rigorous fashion some fundamental properties for
variational high-dimensional tensor networks, which paves a way for their
future theoretical studies and practical applications.

temperature dependence of resistivity under pressures up to 50.5 GPa shows
progressively optimized metallic behavior with pressure. Interestingly, in the
pressure region for the color change, a clear decrease of resistivity is
observed with the increase of pressure, which is accompanied by a clear
increase of the residual resistivity ratio (RRR). Fitting to the low
temperature resistivity gives exponents of about 2, suggesting a Fermi liquid
behavior in low temperature region. The general behavior in wide temperature
region suggests that the electron-phonon scattering is still the dominant one.

form of neural networks to reduce the computation time of simulation-based
optimization of a reference trajectory. Simulation-based optimization is
necessary when there is no analytical form of the system accessible, only
input-output data that can be used to create a surrogate model of the
simulation. Like many high-fidelity simulations, this trajectory planning
simulation is very nonlinear and computationally expensive, making it
challenging to optimize iteratively. Through gradient descent optimization, our
approach finds the optimal reference trajectory for landing a hypersonic
vehicle. In contrast to the large datasets used to create the surrogate models
in prior literature, our methodology is specifically designed to minimize the
number of simulation executions required by the gradient descent optimizer. We
demonstrated this methodology to be more efficient than the standard practice
of hand-tuning the inputs through trial-and-error or randomly sampling the
input parameter space. Due to the intelligently selected input values to the
simulation, our approach yields better simulation outcomes that are achieved
more rapidly and to a higher degree of accuracy. Optimizing the hypersonic
vehicle's reference trajectory is very challenging due to the simulation's
extreme nonlinearity, but even so, this novel approach found a 74%
better-performing reference trajectory compared to nominal, and the numerical
results clearly show a substantial reduction in computation time for designing
future trajectories.

thermodynamical and radiative properties of the loops on metallicity. Higher
density and temperature are obtained in lower-metallicity coronae because of
the inefficient radiative cooling, provided that the surface condition is
unchanged. Thus, it is estimated that the X-ray radiation from metal-poor
coronae is higher because of their denser coronal gas. The generalized scaling
laws can also be used as a tool to study the condition of high-energy radiation

sequential 2D-to-3D lifting human pose estimation. As a pioneering work,
PoseFormer captures spatial relations of human joints in each video frame and
human dynamics across frames with cascaded transformer layers and has achieved
impressive performance. However, in real scenarios, the performance of
PoseFormer and its follow-ups is limited by two factors: (a) The length of the
input joint sequence; (b) The quality of 2D joint detection. Existing methods
typically apply self-attention to all frames of the input sequence, causing a
huge computational burden when the frame number is increased to obtain advanced
estimation accuracy, and they are not robust to noise naturally brought by the
limited capability of 2D joint detectors. In this paper, we propose
PoseFormerV2, which exploits a compact representation of lengthy skeleton
sequences in the frequency domain to efficiently scale up the receptive field
and boost robustness to noisy 2D joint detection. With minimum modifications to
PoseFormer, the proposed method effectively fuses features both in the time
domain and frequency domain, enjoying a better speed-accuracy trade-off than
its precursor. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets (i.e., Human3.6M
and MPI-INF-3DHP) demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms the original PoseFormer and other transformer-based variants. Code

2016. NGC 7582 exhibits a long-term variability between observations but also a
short-term variability in two observations that has not been studied before. To
study the variability, we perform a time-resolved spectral analysis using a
phenomenological model and a physically-motivated model (uxclumpy). The
spectral fitting is achieved using a nested sampling Monte Carlo method.
uxclumpy enables testing various geometries of the absorber that may fit AGN
spectra. We find that the best model is composed of a fully covering clumpy
absorber. From this geometry, we estimate the velocity, size and distance of
the clumps. The column density of the absorber in the line of sight varies from
Compton-thin to Compton-thick between observations. Variability over the
timescale of a few tens of kilo-seconds is also observed within two
observations. The obscuring clouds are consistent with being located at a
distance not larger than 0.6 pc, moving with a transverse velocity exceeding
$\sim 700$ km s$^{-1}$. We could put only a lower limit on the size of the
obscuring cloud being larger than $10^{13}$ cm. Given the sparsity of the
observations, and the limited exposure time per observation available, we
cannot determine the exact structure of the obscuring clouds. The results are
broadly consistent with comet-like obscuring clouds or spherical clouds with a
non-uniform density profile.

normalization constants can be estimated in linear time, allowing us to design
an efficient optimization strategy to learn distributed representations. We
test our approximation on two popular applications related to word and node

represent the fatigue-induced characteristics of spatiotemporal adaptions of
multiple muscles and the estimator that captures the time-evolving progression
of fatigue. In this paper, we propose to depict fatigue by the features of
muscle compensation and spinal module activation changes and estimate
continuous fatigue by a physiological rationale model. First, we extract muscle
synergy fractionation and the variance of spinal module spikings as features
inspired by the prior of fatigue-induced neuromuscular adaptations. Second, we
treat the features as observations and develop a Bayesian Gaussian process to
capture the time-evolving progression. Third, we solve the issue of lacking
supervision information by mathematically formulating the time-evolving
characteristics of fatigue as the loss function. Finally, we adapt the metrics
that follow the physiological principles of fatigue to quantitatively evaluate
the performance. Our extensive experiments present a 0.99 similarity between
days, a over 0.7 similarity with other views of fatigue and a nearly 1 weak
monotonicity, which outperform other methods. This study would aim the
objective assessment of muscle fatigue.

novel molecules predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor DRD2. Our
findings suggest that it is advantageous to use at least both top-scoring and
low-scoring molecules for updating the policy when structural diversity is
essential. Using all generated molecules at an iteration seems to enhance
performance stability for on-policy algorithms. In addition, when replaying
high, intermediate, and low-scoring molecules, off-policy algorithms display
the potential of improving the structural diversity and number of active

revolution for manufacturing, which allows fabrication of materials with

especially response to dynamic loading, highly depend on their 3D structures.
In general, for each specified structural design, it could take hours or days
to perform either finite element analysis (FEA) or experiments to test the
mechanical response of IPCs to a given dynamic load. To accelerate the
physics-based prediction of mechanical properties of IPCs for various
structural designs, we employ a deep neural operator (DNO) to learn the
transient response of IPCs under dynamic loading as surrogate of physics-based
FEA models. We consider a 3D IPC beam formed by two metals with a ratio of
Young's modulus of 2.7, wherein random blocks of constituent materials are used
to demonstrate the generality and robustness of the DNO model. To obtain FEA
results of IPC properties, 5,000 random time-dependent strain loads generated
by a Gaussian process kennel are applied to the 3D IPC beam, and the reaction
forces and stress fields inside the IPC beam under various loading are
collected. Subsequently, the DNO model is trained using an incremental learning
method with sequence-to-sequence training implemented in JAX, leading to a 100X
speedup compared to widely used vanilla deep operator network models. After an
offline training, the DNO model can act as surrogate of physics-based FEA to
predict the transient mechanical response in terms of reaction force and stress
distribution of the IPCs to various strain loads in one second at an accuracy
of 98%. Also, the learned operator is able to provide extended prediction of
the IPC beam subject to longer random strain loads at a reasonably well

for an electron by imposing the relativity to quantum mechanics, leading to the
triumph to derive the Dirac equation. Spin of a photon should be linked to
polarisation, however, the similar argument for an electron was not applicable
to Maxwell equations, which are already Lorentz invariant. Therefore, the
origin of polarisation and its relationship with spin are not completely
elucidated, yet. Here, we discuss propagation of coherent rays of photons in a
graded-index optical fibre, which can be solved exactly using the
Laguerre-Gauss or Hermite-Gauss modes in a cylindrical or a Cartesian
coordinate. We found that the energy spectrum is massive with the effective
mass as a function of the confinement and orbital angular momentum. The
propagation is described by the one-dimensional ($1D$) non-relativistic
Schr\""odinger equation, which is equivalent to the $2D$ space-time Klein-Gordon
equation by a unitary transformation. The probabilistic interpretation and the
conservation law require the factorisation of the Klein-Gordon equation,
leading to the $2D$ Dirac equation with spin. We applied the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)-Bogoliubov theory of superconductivity to a
coherent ray from a laser and identified a radiative
Nambu-Anderson-Higgs-Goldstone mode for recovering the broken symmetry. The
spin expectation value of a photon corresponds to the polarisation state in the
Poincar\'e sphere, which is characterised by fixed phases after the onset of
lasing due to the broken $SU(2)$ symmetry, and it is shown that its azimuthal
angle is coming from the phase of the energy gap.

describe the propagation, according to the theory of relativity. We consider
how light is characterised in a material, where the speed of light is different
from that in a vacuum due to the finite dielectric constant. The phase velocity
in a material is smaller than $c$, such that the speed of a moving frame can be
larger than the phase velocity, such that the frame can move faster than the
speed of light in a material. Consequently, an unusual Doppler effect is
expected, and the wavelength in the moving frame changes from the red-shift to
the blue-shift upon increasing the speed of the frame. The corresponding energy
of the light also changes sign from positive to negative, while momentum is
always positive, leading to the changes of sings for the phase velocity and the
helicity. In a graded index fibre, where the exact solution is available, even
more complicated phenomena are expected, due to the finite effective mass of
photons. Upon the increase of the energy gap, generated by optical confinements
and optical orbital angular momentum, the effective mass of photons increases.
If the gap is large enough, momentum starts to change the sign upon increasing
the frame velocity, while the energy of photons is always positive. In this
case, the phase velocity diverges if momentum is in agreement with the fame
velocity. Contrary to the unusual behaviours of the phase velocity, the group

recommendations have played a paramount role in the growth of the e-commerce

prediction is essential to identify a suitable service among functionally
equivalent services over time. The contemporary temporal QoS prediction methods
hardly achieved the desired accuracy due to various limitations, such as the
inability to handle data sparsity and outliers and capture higher-order
temporal relationships among user-service interactions. Even though some recent
recurrent neural-network-based architectures can model temporal relationships
among QoS data, prediction accuracy degrades due to the absence of other
features (e.g., collaborative features) to comprehend the relationship among
the user-service interactions. This paper addresses the above challenges and
proposes a scalable strategy for Temporal QoS Prediction using Multi-source
Collaborative-Features (TPMCF), achieving high prediction accuracy and faster
responsiveness. TPMCF combines the collaborative-features of users/services by
exploiting user-service relationship with the spatio-temporal auto-extracted
features by employing graph convolution and transformer encoder with multi-head
self-attention. We validated our proposed method on WS-DREAM-2 datasets.
Extensive experiments showed TPMCF outperformed major state-of-the-art

undergo quantitatively similar phase transitions around their percolation
thresholds, and the proofs of these results rely on isoperimetric properties of
the underlying host graph. Recently, the authors showed that such a phase
transition occurs in a large class of regular high-dimensional product graphs,
generalising a classic result for the hypercube.
  In this paper we give new isoperimetric inequalities for such regular
high-dimensional product graphs, which generalise the well-known isoperimetric
inequality of Harper for the hypercube, and are asymptotically sharp for a wide
range of set sizes. We then use these isoperimetric properties to investigate
the structure of the giant component $L_1$ in supercritical percolation on
these product graphs, that is, when $p=\frac{1+\epsilon}{d}$, where $d$ is the
degree of the product graph and $\epsilon>0$ is a small enough constant.
  We show that typically $L_1$ has edge-expansion $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{d\ln
d}\right)$. Furthermore, we show that $L_1$ likely contains a linear-sized
subgraph with vertex-expansion $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{d\ln d}\right)$. These
results are best possible up to the logarithmic factor in $d$.
  Using these likely expansion properties, we determine, up to small
polylogarithmic factors in $d$, the likely diameter of $L_1$ as well as the
typical mixing time of a lazy random walk on $L_1$. Furthermore, we show the
likely existence of a path of length $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{d\ln d}\right)$.
These results not only generalise, but also improve substantially upon the
known bounds in the case of the hypercube, where in particular the likely
diameter and typical mixing time of $L_1$ were previously only known to be
polynomial in $d$.

since the most common strategy for collecting cards is being the first to slap
the pile in the center whenever legal combinations of cards are placed down.
Most players assume that the dominant strategy is to develop a faster reaction
time than your opponents, and no academic inquiry has been levied against this
assumption. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that a ""risk slapping""
strategist who relies on practical economic decision making will win an
overwhelming majority of games against players who rely on quick reflexes
alone. It is theorized that this can be done by exploiting the ""burn rule,"" a
penalty that is too low-cost to effectively dissuade players from slapping
illegally when it benefits them. Using the Ruby programming language, we
construct an Egyptian Ratscrew simulator from scratch. Our model allows us to
simulate the behavior of 8 strategically unique players within easily
adjustable parameters including simulation type, player count, and burn amount.
We simulate 100k iterations of 67 different ERS games, totaling 6.7 million

strategies are dominant under each set of parameters. We then confirm our
hypothesis that risk slapping is a dominant strategy, discover that there is no
strictly dominant approach to risk slapping, and elucidate a deeper
understanding of different ERS mechanics such as the burn rule. Finally, we
assess the implications of our findings and suggest potential improvements to
the rules of the game. We also touch on the real-world applications of our

sources, and their observations are rarely independent. Here we ask: For a
group of ideal observers who do not exchange information, what is the impact of
correlated evidence on decision accuracy? We show that even when agents are
identical, correlated evidence causes decision accuracy to depend on temporal
decision order. Surprisingly, the first decider is less accurate than a lone
observer. Early deciders are less accurate than late deciders. These phenomena
occur despite the fact that the rational observers use the same decision
criterion, so they are equally confident in their decisions. We analyze
discrete and continuum evidence-gathering models to explain why the first
decider is less accurate than a lone observer when evidence is correlated.
Pooling the decisions of early deciders using a majority rule does not rescue
accuracy in the sense that such pooling results in only modest accuracy gain.

coherent state has degrees of freedom for spin and orbital angular momentum,
which allow an arbitrary superposition state among orthogonal states with
varying their amplitudes and phases, described by a representation theory of
Lie algebra and Lie group. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that we can
construct generators of rotations for the quantum states of coherent photons,
simply by combining widely available optical components, such as half- and
quarter-wave plates and vortex lenses. We have found that a superposition state
between vortexed and no-vortex states is characterised by the motion of the
topological charge upon the rotation in the SU(3) states. We also realised
singlet and triplet states by combining rays of photons with orthogonal
polarisation states and vortexed states. This corresponds to realise an
effective SU(4) state and we have confirmed the projection to an
SU(2)$\times$SU(2) state upon passing through a polariser.

profile with topological charge at the centre of the mode, while propagating in
a certain direction. Each mode with different topological charge of $m$ is
orthogonal, in the sense that the overlap integral vanishes among modes with
different values of $m$. Here, we theoretically consider a superposition state
among 3 different modes with left- and right-vorticies and a Gaussian mode
without a vortex. These 3 states are considered to be assigned to different
quantum states, thus, we have employed the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ Lie algebra and
the associated SU(3) Lie group to classify the photonic states. We have
calculated expectation values of 8 generators of the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ Lie
algebra, which should be observable, since the generators are Hermite. We
proposed to call these parameters as Gell-Mann parameters, named after the
theoretical physicist, Murray Gell-Mann, who established Quantum
Chromo-Dynamics (QCD) for quarks. The Gell-Mann parameters are represented on
the 8-dimensional hypersphere with its radius fixed due to the conservation law
of the Casimir operator. We have discussed a possibility to explore photonic
QCD in experiments and classified SU(3) states to embed the parameters in SO(6)
and SO(5).

rehabilitating severely disabled patients in the real world. Two key factors
for successful decoding of user intentions are the size of implanted
microelectrode arrays and a good online spike sorting algorithm. A small but
dense microelectrode array with 3072 channels was recently developed for
decoding user intentions. The process of spike sorting determines the spike
activity (SA) of different sources (neurons) from recorded neural data.
Unfortunately, current spike sorting algorithms are unable to handle the
massively increasing amount of data from dense microelectrode arrays, making
spike sorting a fragile component of the online BCI decoding framework.
Approach. We proposed an adaptive and self-organized algorithm for online spike
sorting, named Adaptive SpikeDeep-Classifier (Ada-SpikeDeepClassifier), which
uses SpikeDeeptector for channel selection, an adaptive background activity
rejector (Ada-BAR) for discarding background events, and an adaptive spike
classifier (Ada-Spike classifier) for classifying the SA of different neural
units. Results. Our algorithm outperformed our previously published
SpikeDeep-Classifier and eight other spike sorting algorithms, as evaluated on
a human dataset and a publicly available simulated dataset. Significance. The
proposed algorithm is the first spike sorting algorithm that automatically
learns the abrupt changes in the distribution of noise and SA. It is an
artificial neural network-based algorithm that is well-suited for hardware
implementation on neuromorphic chips that can be used for wearable invasive
BCIs.

challenging task, particularly in the presence of an open set of interactions
and objects. We address the problem of affordance categorization for
class-agnostic objects with an open set of interactions; we achieve this by
learning similarities between object interactions in an unsupervised way and
thus inducing clusters of object affordances. A novel depth-informed
qualitative spatial representation is proposed for the construction of Activity

spatio-temporal interactions in RGB-D videos. These AGs are clustered to obtain
groups of objects with similar affordances. Our experiments in a real-world

multi-dimensional approach to studying and quantifying common social biases as
reflected in the generated images, by focusing on how occupations, personality
traits, and everyday situations are depicted across representations of
(perceived) gender, age, race, and geographical location. Through an extensive
set of both automated and human evaluation experiments we present findings for
two popular T2I models: DALLE-v2 and Stable Diffusion. Our results reveal that
there exist severe occupational biases of neutral prompts majorly excluding
groups of people from results for both models. Such biases can get mitigated by
increasing the amount of specification in the prompt itself, although the
prompting mitigation will not address discrepancies in image quality or other
usages of the model or its representations in other scenarios. Further, we
observe personality traits being associated with only a limited set of people
at the intersection of race, gender, and age. Finally, an analysis of
geographical location representations on everyday situations (e.g., park, food,
weddings) shows that for most situations, images generated through default
location-neutral prompts are closer and more similar to images generated for
locations of United States and Germany.

determine the optimal combination of individual models by solely analyzing
their most recent prediction performance. This makes it particularly suited for
time series problems, rolling window backtesting procedures, and systems of
potentially black-box models. We derive the optimal gain function, express the

ensemble outperforms both individual machine learning models and their simple
averages in providing better measurements of sector risk premia. Moreover, it

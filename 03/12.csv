regression; that is, instances where subject-specific distributions or
densities, or in practice, repeated measures from those distributions, are the
covariates related to a scalar outcome via a regression model. We propose a
direct regression for such distribution-valued covariates that circumvents
estimating subject-specific densities and directly uses the observed repeated
measures as covariates. The model is invariant to any transformation or
ordering of the repeated measures. Endowing the regression function with a
Gaussian Process prior, we obtain closed form or conjugate Bayesian inference.
Our method subsumes the standard Bayesian non-parametric regression using
Gaussian Processes as a special case. Theoretically, we show that the method
can achieve an optimal estimation error bound. To our knowledge, this is the
first theoretical study on Bayesian regression using distribution-valued
covariates. Through simulation studies and analysis of activity count dataset,
we demonstrate that our method performs better than approaches that require an
intermediate density estimation step.

without temporality, the performance can be maintained with a negligible loss
in accuracy. To that end, we propose a novel GAR technique for volleyball

branch, it extracts the features using attention pooling in a selective way. In
the coordinate branch, it considers the current configuration of the actors and
extracts the spatial information from the box coordinates. Moreover, we
analyzed the Volleyball dataset that the recent literature is mostly based on,
and realized that its labeling scheme degrades the group concept in the
activities to the level of individual actors. We manually reannotated the
dataset in a systematic manner for emphasizing the group concept. Experimental
results on the Volleyball as well as Collective Activity (from another domain,

similarity between categories and distinct differences among data within one
single category. To address the challenges, previous strategies have focused on
localizing subtle discrepancies between categories and enhencing the
discriminative features in them. However, the background also provides
important information that can tell the model which features are unnecessary or
even harmful for classification, and models that rely too heavily on subtle
features may overlook global features and contextual information. In this
paper, we propose a novel network called ``High-temperaturE Refinement and
Background Suppression'' (HERBS), which consists of two modules, namely, the
high-temperature refinement module and the background suppression module, for
extracting discriminative features and suppressing background noise,
respectively. The high-temperature refinement module allows the model to learn
the appropriate feature scales by refining the features map at different scales
and improving the learning of diverse features. And, the background suppression
module first splits the features map into foreground and background using
classification confidence scores and suppresses feature values in
low-confidence areas while enhancing discriminative features. The experimental
results show that the proposed HERBS effectively fuses features of varying
scales, suppresses background noise, discriminative features at appropriate
scales for fine-grained visual classification.The proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the CUB-200-2011 and NABirds benchmarks,

real algebra of finite dimension that has a metric, i.e., a bilinear,
symmetric, and non-degenerate form $\langle\;\rangle$. The metric is considered
$\mathrm{L}$-invariant (resp. $\mathrm{R}$-invariant) if all left
multiplications (resp. right multiplications) are skew-symmetric. The metric is
called associative if $\langle u\bullet v,w\rangle= \langle u,v\bullet
w\rangle$ for all $u, v, w \in \mathfrak{g}$. These three notions coincide when
$\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie algebra and in this case $\mathfrak{g}$ endowed with
the metric is known as a quadratic Lie algebra.
  This paper provides a complete description of $\mathrm{L}$-invariant,
$\mathrm{R}$-invariant, or associative pseudo-Euclidean metrics on left Leibniz
algebras. It shows that a left Leibniz algebra with an associative metric is
also right Leibniz and can be obtained easily from its underlying Lie algebra,
which is a quadratic Lie algebra. Additionally, it shows that at the core of a
left Leibniz algebra endowed with a $\mathrm{L}$-invariant or
$\mathrm{R}$-invariant metric, there are two Lie algebras with one quadratic
and the left Leibniz algebra can be built from these Lie algebras. We derive
many important results from these complete description.
  Finally, the paper provides a list of left Leibniz algebras with an
associative metric up to dimension 6, as well as a list of left Leibniz
algebras with an $\mathrm{L}$-invariant metric, up to dimension 4, and
$\mathrm{R}$-invariant metric up to dimension 5.

Existing NLG methods mainly adopt a supervised approach and rely heavily on
coupled data-to-text pairs. However, for many targeted scenarios and for
non-English languages, sufficient quantities of labeled data are often not
available. To relax the dependency on labeled data of downstream tasks, we
propose an intuitive and effective zero-shot learning framework, ZeroNLG, which
can deal with multiple NLG tasks, including image-to-text (image captioning),
video-to-text (video captioning), and text-to-text (neural machine
translation), across English, Chinese, German, and French within a unified
framework. ZeroNLG does not require any labeled downstream pairs for training.
During training, ZeroNLG (i) projects different domains (across modalities and
languages) to corresponding coordinates in a shared common latent space; (ii)
bridges different domains by aligning their corresponding coordinates in this
space; and (iii) builds an unsupervised multilingual auto-encoder to learn to
generate text by reconstructing the input text given its coordinate in shared
latent space. Consequently, during inference, based on the data-to-text
pipeline, ZeroNLG can generate target sentences across different languages
given the coordinate of input data in the common space. Within this unified
framework, given visual (imaging or video) data as input, ZeroNLG can perform
zero-shot visual captioning; given textual sentences as input, ZeroNLG can
perform zero-shot machine translation. We present the results of extensive
experiments on twelve NLG tasks, showing that, without using any labeled
downstream pairs for training, ZeroNLG generates high-quality and believable
outputs and significantly outperforms existing zero-shot methods.

the traditional trimap concatenation strategy with our tri-token, existing
matting methods could achieve about 10% improvement in SAD and 20% in MSE.
Equipped with the new tri-token design, our proposed TransMatting outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods on several popular matting benchmarks and our
newly collected Transparent-460.

scales that are outside the reach of ab initio calculations. The development of
an interatomic potential for a particular material requires the optimization of
the parameters of the functional form of the potential. We present a
parameterization protocol for analytic bond-order potentials (BOP) that provide
a physically transparent and computationally efficient description of the
interatomic interaction. The parameterization protocol of the BOP follows the
derivation of the BOP along the coarse-graining of the electronic structure
from density-functional theory (DFT) to the tight-binding (TB) bond model to
analytic BOPs. In particular, it starts from TB parameters that are obtained by
downfolding DFT eigenstates of two-atomic molecules to an $sd$-valent minimal
basis. This $sd$-valent Hamiltonian is combined with a pairwise repulsion to
obtain an initial binding energy relation. The $s$ electrons are then removed
from the Hamiltonian and instead represented by an isotropic embedding term. In
the final step, the parameters of the remaining $d$-$d$ interaction, the pair
repulsion and the embedding term are optimized simultaneously. We demonstrate
that the application of this parameterization protocol leads to a basic BOP for
Re with good transferability. We discuss different strategies to refine the
basic BOP towards global transferability or towards local accuracy. We
demonstrate that homogeneous samplings of the structural phase-space in a map
of local atomic environments can be used to systematically increase the global
transferability. We also demonstrate the influence of training data-weighting
on local accuracy refinements with a Pareto-front analysis and suggest further
requirements to select a final BOP. The local accuracy and global
transferability of the final BOP is also shown and compared to DFT.

symmetry for deep neural networks, where both deeply learned features and

that both cross-entropy loss and mean square error can provably lead to NC. We
remove NC's key assumption on the feature dimension and the number of classes,
and then present a generalized neural collapse (GNC) hypothesis that
effectively subsumes the original NC. Inspired by how NC characterizes the
training target of neural networks, we decouple GNC into two objectives:
minimal intra-class variability and maximal inter-class separability. We then
use hyperspherical uniformity (which characterizes the degree of uniformity on
the unit hypersphere) as a unified framework to quantify these two objectives.
Finally, we propose a general objective -- hyperspherical uniformity gap (HUG),
which is defined by the difference between inter-class and intra-class
hyperspherical uniformity. HUG not only provably converges to GNC, but also
decouples GNC into two separate objectives. Unlike cross-entropy loss that
couples intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, HUG enjoys more
flexibility and serves as a good alternative loss function. Empirical results
show that HUG works well in terms of generalization and robustness.

resources can be used for attacks. Logical separation can ensure design
integrity, but on-chip resources can still be exploited. Conventional SCA
mitigation can help, but it requires significant effort, and bitstream checking
techniques are not highly accurate. An active on-chip defense mechanism is
needed for tenant confidentiality. Toward this, we propose a lightweight
shielding technique utilizing ring oscillators (ROs) to protect applications
against remote power SCA. Unlike existing RO-based approaches, in our
methodology, an offline pre-processing stage is proposed to carefully configure
power monitors and an obfuscating circuit concerning the resource constraints
of the board. Detection of power fluctuations due to application execution
enables the obfuscating circuit to flatten the power consumption trace. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed SHIELD, we implemented it on a
Xilinx Zynq-7000 FPGA board executing an RSA encryption algorithm. Due to the
SHIELD, the number of traces required to extract the encryption key is
increased by 166x, making an attack extremely hard at run-time. Note that the
proposed SHIELD does not require any modification in the target application.
Our methodology also shows up to 54% less power consumption and up to 26% less
area overhead than the state-of-the-art random noise-addition-based defense.

Search on the line. Similar to the setting for Binary Search, a target is
chosen adversarially on the line, and in response to a query, the algorithm
learns whether the query was correct, too high, or too low. Different from the
Binary Search setting, the cost of a query is a monotone non-decreasing
function of the distance between the query and the correct answer; different
functions can be used for queries that are too high vs. those that are too low.
The algorithm's goal is to identify an adversarially chosen target with minimum
total cost. Note that the algorithm does not even know the cost it incurred
until the end, when the target is revealed. This abstraction captures many
natural settings in which a principal experiments by setting a quantity (such
as an item price, bandwidth, tax rate, medicine dosage, etc.) where the cost or
regret increases the further the chosen setting is from the optimal one.
  First, we show that for arbitrary symmetric cost functions (i.e.,
overshooting vs. undershooting by the same amount leads to the same cost), the
standard Binary Search algorithm is a 4-approximation.
  We then show that when the cost functions are bounded-degree polynomials of
the distance, the problem can be solved optimally using Dynamic Programming;
this relies on a careful encoding of the combined cost of past queries (which,
recall, will only be revealed in the future). We then generalize the setting to
finding a node on a tree; here, the response to a query is the direction on the
tree in which the target is located, and the cost is increasing in the distance
on the tree from the query to the target. Using the k-cut search tree framework
of Berendsohn and Kozma and the ideas we developed for the case of the line, we
give a PTAS when the cost function is a bounded-degree polynomial.

interaction-to-segmentation and segmentation propagation. Given a medical
volume, a user first segments a slice (or several slices) via the interaction
module and then propagates the segmentation(s) to the remaining slices. The
user may repeat this process multiple times until a sufficiently high volume
segmentation quality is achieved. However, due to the lack of human correction
during propagation, segmentation errors are prone to accumulate in the
intermediate slices and may lead to sub-optimal performance. To alleviate this
issue, we propose a simple yet effective cycle consistency loss that
regularizes an intermediate segmentation by referencing the accurate
segmentation in the starting slice. To this end, we introduce a backward
segmentation path that propagates the intermediate segmentation back to the
starting slice using the same propagation network. With cycle consistency
training, the propagation network is better regularized than in standard
forward-only training approaches. Evaluation results on challenging benchmarks
such as AbdomenCT-1k and OAI-ZIB demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

fact that magnetic fields have a significant impact on the motion of charged

magnetic coupling parameter has a comparable impact on the motion of magnetic
monopole charge, leading to an increase/decrease in the radius of the innermost
stable circular orbit (ISCO) that plays a crucial role in setting the accretion
disk's the inner edge. Further, we analyze the characteristics of the epicyclic
motion and determine the generic form for the epicyclic frequencies. Our
results demonstrate that the existence of the magnetic coupling parameter can
account for the observed resonance of high frequency QPOs from selected three
specific microquasars. We have applied the Monte Carlo simulations with the
observed frequencies for three selected microquasars to constrain the
parameters of the magnetically charged stringy black holes as well as coupling
parameters that describe the interaction between the particle and the black

investigation. In the present paper, we use the recently developed
nonequilibrium DMFT+CPA embedding scheme, that combines both the dynamical mean
field theory (DMFT) and the coherent potential approximation (CPA)
nonequilibrium extensions, to characterize the relaxation and the
thermalization of a disordered interacting system described by the
Anderson-Hubbard model under an interaction quench. The system, initially in
equilibrium at a given temperature, has the interaction abruptly switched from
zero to a finite value at a given time. To investigate the role of disorder, we
use our effective medium approach to calculate, for different values of the
final interaction and of the disorder strength, the distribution functions as
the system evolves in time. This allows us to determine the effective
temperature after the quench and to analyze the effects of disorder on the
thermalization for various interaction strengths. We find that, for moderate
interactions after the interaction quench, disorder can tune the final
temperature of the system across a broad range of values with increased
disorder strength leading to lower effective temperature.

X-rays to identify different dental diseases has tremendously increased.
Although numerous ML models have been developed for the interpretation of
panoramic X-rays, there has not been an end-to-end model developed that can
identify problematic teeth with dental enumeration and associated diagnoses at
the same time. To develop such a model, we structure the three distinct types
of annotated data hierarchically following the FDI system, the first labeled
with only quadrant, the second labeled with quadrant-enumeration, and the third
fully labeled with quadrant-enumeration-diagnosis. To learn from all three
hierarchies jointly, we introduce a novel diffusion-based hierarchical
multi-label object detection framework by adapting a diffusion-based method
that formulates object detection as a denoising diffusion process from noisy
boxes to object boxes. Specifically, to take advantage of the hierarchically
annotated data, our method utilizes a novel noisy box manipulation technique by
adapting the denoising process in the diffusion network with the inference from
the previously trained model in hierarchical order. We also utilize a
multi-label object detection method to learn efficiently from partial
annotations and to give all the needed information about each abnormal tooth
for treatment planning. Experimental results show that our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art object detection methods, including RetinaNet,
Faster R-CNN, DETR, and DiffusionDet for the analysis of panoramic X-rays,

networks and beyond to support latency-critical applications. Cloud-RAN and MEC
are considered as the key driving technology that can help reduce end-to-end
latency. However, the use of MEC nodes poses radical changes to the access
network architecture. As it brings the processing and the networking services
closer to the edge, it often requires network functions (for example, the CU/DU
stack and the application processing) to be distributed across different MEC
sites. Therefore, a novel transport mechanism is needed to efficiently
coordinate and connect network functions across MEC nodes.
  In order to address this challenge, we propose a novel two-tier virtualized
PON transport method with schedulers coordination over a virtualised and sliced
MESH-PON architecture. While a MESH-PON architecture enables direct
communication between MEC nodes that are hosting CU/DU and/or the application

transporting signals across the different PON tiers, while maintaining the
flexibility of the multi-tier methods. We show that our proposed scheme can
achieve end-to-end application-level latency below 1ms or 2ms, depending on the

continuous-time estimation problem for the velocity and numerically integrate
for the 6-DOF pose estimate afterward. The caveat is that angular velocity is
not observable with a single FMCW lidar. We address this limitation by also
incorporating the angular velocity measurements from a gyroscope. This results
in an extremely efficient odometry method that processes lidar frames at an

carry faster-than logarithmic divergences over a wide range of parameters in
cuprate-like electronic band dispersions. Numerical analysis gives insight into
the quantization of the VHS power-law-exponent pV and into transitions between
hoVHSs with different values of pV. The cuprates are found to lie in the
parameter regime where the amplitude of the hoVHS is not too large. Our study
indicates that the occurrence of high-temperature superconductivity requires
simultaneous tuning of two different competing orders (antiferromagnetism and
the density wave associated with the hoVHS in cuprates), which is why it is so
rare.

  functions","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nucl-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Angular momentum projection plays a key role in studying nuclei and other
quantum many-body systems with rotational invariance. In this Letter, we report
a new fundamental feature of the angular momentum projection, which clearly
tells us the frequently discussed $K$-mixing in the angular momentum projected
nuclear wave function can be safely removed. At a given spin $J$, one can
generate $2J+1$ angular momentum projected states from a deformed Slater
determinant. These projected states are labeled with different $K$ numbers.
Usually, a nuclear wave function with $K$-mixing can be expressed as an
expansion in terms of all these $2J+1$ projected states. The coefficients in
this expansion can be obtained by solving the Hill-Wheeler equation.
Strikingly, we found that such nuclear wave function with $K$-mixing can always
be equivalently replaced by a single projected state generated from another
Slater determinant. Consequently, such nuclear wave function can be
significantly simplified, especially for high-spin states. This also reminds us
that the $K$-mixing in the angular momentum projected nuclear wave functions,
adopted by many present-day nuclear models, does not carry any physical
meaning, and is essentially different from that $K$-mixing caused by the
Coriolis force in the cranked shell model.

token sparsification has been applied to Vision Transformers (ViT) to
accelerate classification, it is still unknown how to perform segmentation from
sparse tokens. To this end, we reformulate segmentation as a sparse encoding ->
token completion -> dense decoding (SCD) pipeline. We first empirically show
that naively applying existing approaches from classification token pruning and
masked image modeling (MIM) leads to failure and inefficient training caused by
inappropriate sampling algorithms and the low quality of the restored dense
features. In this paper, we propose Soft-topK Token Pruning (STP) and
Multi-layer Token Assembly (MTA) to address these problems. In sparse encoding,
STP predicts token importance scores with a lightweight sub-network and samples
the topK tokens. The intractable topK gradients are approximated through a
continuous perturbed score distribution. In token completion, MTA restores a
full token sequence by assembling both sparse output tokens and pruned
multi-layer intermediate ones. The last dense decoding stage is compatible with
existing segmentation decoders, e.g., UNETR. Experiments show SCD pipelines
equipped with STP and MTA are much faster than baselines without token pruning
in both training (up to 120% higher throughput and inference up to 60.6% higher
throughput) while maintaining segmentation quality.

scaling relations, showing that the sample $M_{\rm BH}$ ranges from
$10^{5.1}\,M_\odot$ to $10^{8.2}\,M_\odot$. We developed a survey efficiency
corrected maximum volume method to infer the rates. The rest-frame $g$-band

$L_{\rm bk}=10^{43.1}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. In the BH mass regime of
$10^{5.2}\lesssim (M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \lesssim 10^{7.2}$, the TDE mass
function follows $\phi(M_{\rm BH})\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-0.25}$, which favors a
flat local BH mass function ($dn_{\rm BH}/d{\rm log}M_{\rm BH}\approx{\rm

($M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$), which is consistent with theoretical
predictions considering direct capture of hydrogen-burning stars by the event
horizon. At a host galaxy mass of $M_{\rm gal}\sim 10^{10}\,M_\odot$, the
average optical TDE rate is $\approx 3.2\times 10^{-5}\,{\rm

way of getting the optimized nuclear wave functions, so that they can be as
close as possible to the exact shell model ones. However, we found there are
two additional problems that may seriously affect the convergence of the VAP
iteration. The first problem is, if a randomly selected projected basis state
does not mix with a VAP wave function in the VAP calculation, then it is likely
that this basis state will never mix with the VAP wave function even after the
VAP iteration converges, which means such selected projected basis state is
useless. The other problem is the poor orthonormality among the projected basis
states that seriously affect the accuracy of the calculated VAP wave function.
In the present work, solutions for these two problems are proposed and some
examples are presented to test the validity. It turns out that, with the
present solutions, the most important projected basis states can be reliably

Secondly, we establish a dataset of \emph{100} instances made from floor plans,

exceptionally large in the millikelvin regime, with a coefficient of ~ 4,100
uV/KT at zero magnetic field, an indication of the proliferation of vortices.
Surprisingly, the Nernst signal abruptly disappears when the doping falls below
the critical value, in striking conflict with conventional expectations. This
series of phenomena, which have no prior analogue, call for careful
examinations of the mechanism of the QCP, including the possibility of a
continuous QPT between two distinct ordered phases in the monolayer. Our
experiments open a new avenue for studying unconventional QPTs and quantum
critical matter.

fantastic phenomena in Nature. Here we show that injecting a current may lead
to new topological phases, especially new gapless topological metallic phases
with extended Fermi surfaces (FSs) through novel class of TPTs in the bulk or
the boundary. Specifically, we study the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) system in
a square lattice under various forms of injecting currents. In addition to the
previously known Chern insulator (which will be called even Chern insulator
here), band insulator and band metal (BM), we find three new topological phases
we name as: the gapped odd Chern insulator (Odd CI), the gapless odd Chern
metal (Odd CM) and even Chern metal (Even CM). The Chern number may not be
effective anymore in characterizing the topological gapless phases with
extended FS. It is the Hall conductance which acts as the new topological
invariant in such gapless systems. Its jump is a universal integer or
non-integer across the even CM/BM or odd CM/BM TPT respectively where there is
also a corresponding TPT in the Longitudinal (L-)edge modes. The Odd/even CM to
BM transition is a novel class of TPT without any non-analyticity in the ground
state energy density. This presents the first example of a TPT which is not a
quantum phase transition (QPT). The original bulk-edge correspondence is
enriched into bulk/Longitudinal (L-)/Transverse (T-) edge correspondence. The
L-edge reconstruction may happen earlier, later or at the same time as the bulk
TPT respectively in the even CI/odd CI/odd CM sequence with the edge dynamic
exponent $ z_L=3 $, in the even CI/even CM/odd CM sequence with $ z_L=2 $ or a
direct even CI/odd CM with a flat edge. The disappearance of the T-edge always
happen at the same time as the bulk TPT with a universal edge critical
behaviour.

capture a 3D representation of the environment before contact and uses
photometric stereo to reconstruct the tactile imprint generated by an object
during contact. To this end, two cameras were integrated in a single sensor,
whose interface is made of a transparent elastomer coated with a thin layer of
paint with a level of transparency that can be adjusted by varying the sensor's
internal lighting conditions. We describe the sensor's fabrication and evaluate
its performance for both tactile perception and 3D vision. Our results show
that the proposed sensor can reconstruct a 3D view of a scene just before
grasping and perceive the tactile imprint after grasping, allowing for

fine-tuned on real underwater datasets to obtain a reliable underwater image

distribution in the training set and the testing set. This drawback can damage
the prediction performance in unseen data. Consequently, we propose a scalable
and easily adaptable approach based on an informative regularization and an
ad-hoc training procedure to mitigate the shift problem during the training of
a multi-layer perceptron for RR Lyrae classification. We collect ranges for
characteristic features to construct a symbolic representation of prior

Simultaneously, we design a two-step back-propagation algorithm to integrate
this knowledge into the neural network, whereby one step is applied in each
epoch to minimize classification error, while another is applied to ensure
regularization. Our algorithm defines a subset of parameters (a mask) for each
loss function. This approach handles the forgetting effect, which stems from a
trade-off between these loss functions (learning from data versus learning
expert knowledge) during training. Experiments were conducted using recently
proposed shifted benchmark sets for RR Lyrae stars, outperforming baseline
models by up to 3\% through a more reliable classifier. Our method provides a
new path to incorporate knowledge from characteristic features into artificial

annotations are precise and unique, yet one query may describe multiple moments

striving to match single-label annotations will inevitably introduce false
negatives during optimization. In this study, we reformulate this task as a
one-vs-many optimization problem under the condition of single positive labels.
The unlabeled moments are considered unobserved rather than negative, and we
explore mining potential positive moments to assist in multiple moment
retrieval. In this setting, we propose a novel Diverse Temporal Grounding
framework, termed DTG-SPL, which mainly consists of a positive moment
estimation (PME) module and a diverse moment regression (DMR) module. PME
leverages semantic reconstruction information and an expected positive
regularization to uncover potential positive moments in an online fashion.
Under the supervision of these pseudo positives, DMR is able to localize
diverse moments in parallel that meet different users. The entire framework
allows for end-to-end optimization as well as fast inference. Extensive

VLOSS starts from a Mask2Former universal segmentation framework with CLIP text

omni-supervised data (i.e., panoptic segmentation data, object detection data,

information, and the edges and details can not be well recovered. With the
development of hardware technology and mathematics, people begin to use
in-depth learning methods for image super-resolution tasks, from direct

have gradually achieved good results. In the research of multi-graph

topology for establishing spatial correspondence, implicitly maintained during
segmenting two or more images. With an example application of registering local
vertebral sub-regions found in CT images, our experimental results showed that
the GNN-based segmentation is capable of accurate and reliable localization of
the same interventionally interesting structures between images, not limited to
the segmentation classes. The reported average target registration errors of
2.2$\pm$1.3 mm and 2.7$\pm$1.4 mm, for aligning holdout test images with a
reference and for aligning two test images, respectively, were by a
considerable margin lower than those from the tested non-learning and
learning-based registration algorithms. Further ablation studies assess the
contributions towards the registration performance, from individual components
in the originally segmentation-purposed network and its training algorithm. The
results highlight that the proposed segmentation-in-lieu-of-registration
approach shares methodological similarities with existing registration methods,
such as the use of displacement smoothness constraint and point distance
minimization albeit on non-grid graphs, which interestingly yielded benefits
for both segmentation and registration. We, therefore, conclude that the
template-based GNN segmentation can effectively establish spatial
correspondence in our application, without any other dedicated registration
algorithms.

crucial as it instructs how and when actions should be taken. Yet, similar to
static causality, deriving causal relations from observational time-series

can greatly benefit from human insight to break ties and resolve errors. We
hence propose a set of visual analytics methods that allow humans to

collapse in which representations converge to a single point, we dive into a
more general perspective of dimensional collapse in which representations lie
in a narrow cone. Accordingly, inspired by the effectiveness of contrastive
learning in preventing dimensional collapse, we propose a novel normalization
layer called ContraNorm. Intuitively, ContraNorm implicitly shatters
representations in the embedding space, leading to a more uniform distribution

ContraNorm can alleviate both complete collapse and dimensional collapse under
certain conditions. Our proposed normalization layer can be easily integrated
into GNNs and Transformers with negligible parameter overhead. Experiments on

$\tau$, with a normalization set by the Planck time $t_P$, and not on $R$, or
on any larger system in which it may be embedded. This principle leads to
universal scaling for variance on angular scale $\Theta$ , $\langle\delta\tau^2

frozen pre-training models. Though effective, it is particularly problematic in
the few-shot scenario, where prompt tuning performance is sensitive to the
initialization and requires a time-consuming process to find a good
initialization, thus restricting the fast adaptation ability of the
pre-training models. In addition, prompt tuning could undermine the
generalizability of the pre-training models, because the learnable prompt
tokens are easy to overfit to the limited training samples. To address these
issues, we introduce a novel Gradient-RegulAted Meta-prompt learning (GRAM)
framework that jointly meta-learns an efficient soft prompt initialization for
better adaptation and a lightweight gradient regulating function for strong
cross-domain generalizability in a meta-learning paradigm using only the
unlabeled image-text pre-training data. Rather than designing a specific prompt

methods in a model-agnostic way, and comprehensive experiments show that GRAM
brings about consistent improvement for them in several settings (i.e.,
few-shot learning, cross-domain generalization, cross-dataset generalization,
etc.) over 11 datasets. Further, experiments show that GRAM enables the
orthogonal methods of textual and visual prompt tuning to work in a
mutually-enhanced way, offering better generalizability beyond the uni-modal

counterparts at measurable scales in the standard model. However, the existence
of these states can have implications for cosmology as they contribute to the
radiation energy density at early times, and the matter energy density at late
times. How Dirac neutrinos may populate thermal states via an anomalous
magnetic moment operator is the focus of this work. A class of models where all

considered. Subsequently, the cross sections for neutrinos scattering on

constraint on the size of the neutrino magnetic moment from the cosmological
parameter $N_{\rm eff}$ and light-element primordial abundances. Finally, how

desired to save the cost of transferring the learned knowledge. Our recent work
found that vision-language models (VLMs) are efficient learners with
extraordinary cross-domain ability. Therefore, in this work, we further explore
the possibility of leveraging pre-trained VLMs as medical foundation models for
building general-purpose medical AI, where we thoroughly investigate three
machine-learning paradigms, i.e., domain/task-specialized learning, joint
learning, and continual learning, for training the VLMs and evaluate their
generalization performance on cross-domain and cross-task test sets. To
alleviate the catastrophic forgetting during sequential training, we employ
rehearsal learning and receive a sharp boost in terms of generalization
capability. In a nutshell, our empirical evidence suggests that continual
learning may be a practical and efficient learning paradigm for the medical
foundation model. And we hope researchers can use our empirical evidence as
basement to further explore the path toward medical foundation model.

restricted attention to connections with regular or unramified singularities.
Recently, the authors, together with Kulkarni and Matherne, formulated a
version of the Deligne--Simpson problem where certain ramified singular points
are allowed and solved it for the case of Coxeter connections, i.e.,
connections on the Riemann sphere with a maximally ramified singularity at zero
and (possibly) an additional regular singular point at infinity. A certain
matrix completion problem, which we call the Upper Nilpotent Completion
Problem, plays a key role in our solution. This problem was solved by Krupnik
and Leibman, but their work does not provide a practical way of constructing
explicit matrix completions. Accordingly, our previous work does not give
explicit Coxeter connections with specified singularities. In this paper, we
provide a numerically stable and highly efficient algorithm for producing upper
nilpotent completions of certain matrices that arise in the theory of Coxeter
connections. Moreover, we show how the matrices generated by this algorithm can
be used to provide explicit constructions of Coxeter connections with arbitrary
unipotent monodromy in each case that such a connection exists.

is: Is there a better masking strategy than random sampling and how can we

object-centric priors in mask sampling can significantly improve the learned

differentiable framework that uses Gumbel-Softmax to interlink an
adversarially-trained mask generator and a mask-guided image modeling process.
In this way, our approach can adaptively find patches with higher information
density for different images, and further strike a balance between the
information gain obtained from image reconstruction and its practical training
difficulty. In our experiments, AutoMAE is shown to provide effective
pretraining models on standard self-supervised benchmarks and downstream tasks.

such works ineffective in the context of app reviews. In this work, we propose
a new framework, PPrior, that enables proactive prioritization of app issues

challenging given that, unlike social posts, social network features of users

large number of user reviews receive little to no votes. PPrior employs a
pre-trained T5 model and works in three phases. Phase one adapts the

phase two, we leverage contrastive training to learn a generic and

thermally activated process essential to many phenomena during plastic
deformation, including dislocation pattern formation, strain hardening, and
dynamic recovery. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has played an important
role in determining the microscopic mechanisms of cross slip. However, due to
its limited timescale, MD can only predict cross-slip rates in high-stress or
high-temperature conditions. The transition state theory can predict the
cross-slip rate over a broad range of stress and temperature conditions, but
its predictions have been found to be several orders of magnitude too low in
comparison to MD results. This discrepancy can be expressed as an anomalously
large activation entropy whose physical origin remains unclear. Here we resolve
this discrepancy by showing that the large activation entropy results from
anharmonic effects, including thermal softening, thermal expansion, and soft
vibrational modes of the dislocation. We expect these anharmonic effects to be
significant in a wide range of stress-driven thermally activated processes in

disks to a considerable radial distance. (2) The correlation between silicate
emission within the inner regions of disks and the depletion of PAH emission
can result from dust-mixing and PAH coagulation mechanisms and competition over
UV photons. (3) For all objects in our sample, PAHs undergo stochastic heating

This result is distinguished from previous results based on LICQ-like
smoothness assumption. With all these theoretical properties, we design an
algorithm that equip a manifold optimization method with a strategy to escape
from non-optimal non-regular points. Our algorithm can also be used as a
heuristic for solving the quadratic knapsack problem. Numerical experiments are
conducted to verify the high efficiency and robustness of our algorithm as
compared to other SDP solvers and a heuristic method based on dynamic
programming. In particular, our algorithm is able to solve the SDP relaxation
of a one-million dimensional QKP with a sparse cost matrix very accurately in
about 20 minutes on a modest desktop computer.

defenses based on statistical differences take effect only against specific
attacks, especially when the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones or
the data are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In
this paper, we revisit the distance-based defense methods and discover that i)
Euclidean distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions and ii) malicious
gradients with diverse characteristics cannot be identified by a single metric.
To this end, we present a simple yet effective defense strategy with
multi-metrics and dynamic weighting to identify backdoors adaptively.
Furthermore, our novel defense has no reliance on predefined assumptions over
attack settings or data distributions and little impact on benign performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on different datasets under various attack settings, where our
method achieves the best defensive performance. For instance, we achieve the
lowest backdoor accuracy of 3.06% under the difficult Edge-case PGD, showing
significant superiority over previous defenses. The results also demonstrate
that our method can be well-adapted to a wide range of non-IID degrees without
sacrificing the benign performance.

downstreamness, with a correlation slope close to $+1$. This effect is stable
over time and across countries, and it has been confirmed and validated by

quantum metrology. However, the rapid decoherence of quantum entangled states,
due to the unavoidable environment noise, result in practically the unwanted
sharp drop of the measurement sensitivity. To overcome such a difficulty, here
we propose a spin-oscillator hybrid quantum interferometer to achieve the
desirable precise estimation of the parameter encoded in the vibrations of the
oscillator. Differing from the conventional two-mode quantum interferometers
input by the two-mode NOON state or entangled coherent states (ECS), whose
achievable sensitivities are strongly limited by the decoherence of the
entangled vibrational states, we demonstrate that the present interferometer,
input by a spin-dependent two-mode entangled state, possesses a manifest
advantage, i.e., the measurement sensitivity of the estimated parameter is not
influenced by the decoherence from the spin-oscillator entanglement. This is
because that, by applying a spin-oscillator disentangled operation, the
information of the estimated parameter encoded originally in the vibrational
degrees can be effectively transferred into the spin degree and then can be
sensitively estimated by the precise spin-state population measurements. As
consequence, the proposed hybrid quantum interferometer possesses a manifest
robustness against the particle losses of the vibrational modes. Interestingly,
the achieved phase measurement sensitivity can still surpass the SQL obviously,
even if relatively large number of particle loss occurs in one of the two
modes. The potential application of the proposed spin-oscillator hybrid quantum

Thus, it is challenging to reap the benefits of deep learning, and even small

Furthermore, SynthER enables online agents to train with a much higher

background has important implications for the observation of the 21-cm signal

absorption trough found in the 21-cm global spectrum measured by the EDGES
experiment, which has a much greater depth than the standard model prediction,
has drawn great interest to this scenario, but more generally it is still of
great interest to consider such a cosmic radio background (CRB) in the early
Universe. To be effective in affecting the 21-cm signal at early time, such a
radio background must be produced by sources which can emit strong radio
signals but modest amount of X-rays, so that the gas is not heated up too
early. We investigate the scenario that such a radio background is produced by
the primordial black holes (PBHs). For PBH with a single mass, we find that if
the PBHs' abundance $\log(f_{\rm PBH})$ (ratio of total PBH mass density to
total matter density) and mass satisfy the relation $\log(f_{\rm PBH}) \sim
-1.8\log(M_\bullet/{\rm M}_{\odot})-3.5$ for $1\,{\rm M}_\odot \lesssim
M_\bullet \lesssim 300 {\rm M}_\odot$, and have jet emission, they can generate
a CRB required for reproducing the 21-cm absorption signal seen by the EDGES.
The accretion rate can be boosted if the PBHs are surrounded by dark matter
halos, which permits lower $f_{\rm PBH}$ value to satisfy the EDGES
observation. In the latter scenario, since the accretion rate can evolve
rapidly during the Cosmic Dawn, the frequency (redshift) and depth of the
absorption trough can determine the mass and abundance of the PBHs
simultaneously. For absorption trough redshift $\sim$ 17 and depth $\sim -500$

Existing CL methods can mitigate forgetting by replaying previous data.
However, since the CLIP dataset is private, replay methods cannot access the

downstream tasks can enhance their performance but comes at the cost of
sacrificing zero-shot performance. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel method ZSCL to prevent zero-shot transfer degradation in the continual

  In this paper, we shall study the properties which match and merge functions

  The natural partial order on a partial groupoid is defined when the partial
groupoid satisfies Idempotence and Catenary associativity. Given a partial
order on a partial groupoid, the least upper bound and compatibility ($LU_{pg}$
and $CP_{pg}$) properties are equivalent to Idempotence, Commutativity,
Associativity, and Representativity and the partial order must be the natural
one we defined when the domain of the partial operation is reflexive. The
partiality of a partial groupoid can be reduced using connected components and
clique covers of its domain graph, and a noncommutative partial groupoid can be
mapped to a commutative one homomorphically if it has the partial idempotent
semigroup like structures.
  In a finitely generated partial groupoid $(P,D,\circ)$ without any conditions
required, the ER we concern is the full elements in $P$. If $(P,D,\circ)$
satisfies Idempotence and Catenary associativity, then the ER is the maximal
elements in $P$, which are full elements and form the ER defined in

has been used for several decades, suffers from a well-known numerical problem,
called teleportation, where the photons might propagate faster than the exact
solution due to the finite size of the spatial and temporal resolution. The
Semi-analog Monte-Carlo algorithm proposed the use of two kinds of particles,
photons and material particles that are born when a photon is absorbed. The
material particle can `propagate' only by transforming into a photon, due to
black-body emission. While this algorithm produces a teleportation-free result,
it is noisier results compared to IMC due to the discrete nature of the
absorption-emission process. In a previous work [Steinberg and Heizler, ApJS,

particles, and therefore has teleportation-free results, but also uses the
continuous absorption algorithm of IMC, yielding smoother results. This work is
a direct frequency-dependent (energy-dependent) generalization of the DIMC

considered. In the first model, the memoryless state sequence is distributed
according to a fixed distribution and the goal of the radar receiver is to
reconstruct this state-sequence with smallest possible distortion. In the
second model, the memoryless state is distributed either according to $P_S$ or
to $Q_S$ and the radar's goal is to detect this underlying distribution so that
the missed-detection error probability has maximum exponential decay-rate

tool based on amino acid balancing to evaluate the performance of CFPS by
determining the fractional yield as the ratio between theoretically achievable
and achieved protein molar concentration. This tool was applied to a series of
experiments from our lab and to various systems described in the literature to
identify systems that synthesize proteins very efficiently and those that still
have potential for higher yields. The well-established Escherichia coli system
showed a high efficiency in the utilization of amino acids, but interestingly,

AR system. At present, most 3D adversarial attack methods perturb the entire
point cloud to generate adversarial examples, which results in high
perturbation costs and difficulty in reconstructing the corresponding real
objects in the physical world. In this paper, we propose an adaptive local
adversarial attack method (AL-Adv) on 3D point clouds to generate adversarial
point clouds. First, we analyze the vulnerability of the 3D network model and
extract the salient regions of the input point cloud, namely the vulnerable
regions. Second, we propose an adaptive gradient attack algorithm that targets
vulnerable regions. The proposed attack algorithm adaptively assigns different
disturbances in different directions of the three-dimensional coordinates of
the point cloud. Experimental results show that our proposed method AL-Adv
achieves a higher attack success rate than the global attack method.
Specifically, the adversarial examples generated by the AL-Adv demonstrate good
imperceptibility and small generation costs.

whose first algorithms date back at least to the 1950s with the works of Quine
and Karnaugh. Most previous work in the area has focused on obtaining minimal,
or quasi-minimal, formulae in conjunctive normal form (CNF) or disjunctive
normal form (DNF), with applications in hardware design. In this paper, we are
interested in the problem of obtaining an equivalent formula in any format,
also allowing connectives that are not present in the original formula. We are
primarily motivated in applying minimization algorithms to generate natural
language translations of the original formula, where using shorter equivalents
as input may result in better translations. Recently, Buchfuhrer and Umans have
proved that the (decisional version of the) problem is $\Sigma_2^p$-complete.
  We analyze three possible (practical) approaches to solving the problem.
First, using brute force, generating all possible formulae in increasing size
and checking if they are equivalent to the original formula by testing all
possible variable assignments. Second, generating the Tseitin coding of all the
formulae and checking equivalence with the original using a SAT solver. Third,
encoding the problem as a Quantified Boolean Formula (QBF), and using a QBF
solver. Our results show that the QBF approach largely outperforms the other
two.

CGAN4FL: a data augmentation approach using Context-aware Generative

failure-inducing context and synthesize the minority class of test cases (i.e.,
failing test cases). Finally, CGAN4FL augments the synthesized data into
original test cases to acquire a class-balanced dataset for FL. Our experiments
show that CGAN4FL significantly improves FL effectiveness, e.g., promoting

known system dynamics. To solve them, one typically resorts to robust
optimization methods. However, this significantly increases computational
complexity and limits scalability in both learning and planning. On the other
hand, regularized MDPs show more stability in policy learning without impairing
time complexity. Yet, they generally do not encompass uncertainty in the model
dynamics. In this work, we aim to learn robust MDPs using regularization. We
first show that regularized MDPs are a particular instance of robust MDPs with
uncertain reward. We thus establish that policy iteration on reward-robust MDPs
can have the same time complexity as on regularized MDPs. We further extend
this relationship to MDPs with uncertain transitions: this leads to a
regularization term with an additional dependence on the value function. We
then generalize regularized MDPs to twice regularized MDPs ($\text{R}^2$ MDPs),
i.e., MDPs with $\textit{both}$ value and policy regularization. The
corresponding Bellman operators enable us to derive planning and learning
schemes with convergence and generalization guarantees, thus reducing
robustness to regularization. We numerically show this two-fold advantage on
tabular and physical domains, highlighting the fact that $\text{R}^2$ preserves
its efficacy in continuous environments.

designing proportion fairness (PF) metrics that first consider systematic
fairness. However, sociological researches show that to make the market more
stable, max-min fairness (MMF) is a better metric. The main reason is that MMF
aims to improve the utility of the worst ones preferentially, guiding the
system to support the providers in weak market positions. When applying MMF to
recommender systems, how to balance user preferences and provider fairness in
an online recommendation scenario is still a challenging problem. In this
paper, we proposed an online re-ranking model named Provider Max-min Fairness
Re-ranking (P-MMF) to tackle the problem. Specifically, P-MMF formulates
provider fair recommendation as a resource allocation problem, where the
exposure slots are considered the resources to be allocated to providers and
the max-min fairness is used as the regularizer during the process. We show
that the problem can be further represented as a regularized online optimizing
problem and solved efficiently in its dual space. During the online re-ranking
phase, a momentum gradient descent method is designed to conduct the dynamic
re-ranking. Theoretical analysis showed that the regret of P-MMF can be
bounded. Experimental results on four public recommender datasets demonstrated
that P-MMF can outperformed the state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental
results also show that P-MMF can retain small computationally costs on a corpus

all paths in the graph are fuzzily aligned with the reference sentence. We do
not require the exact alignment but train the model to maximize a fuzzy

translations in all modalities into account. Extensive experiments on major WMT

applications now incorporate them. However, many studies in the field of image
classification have shown that MLs can be fooled by a variety of adversarial
attacks. These attacks take advantage of ML algorithms' inherent vulnerability.
This raises many questions in the cybersecurity field, where a growing number
of researchers are recently investigating the feasibility of such attacks
against machine learning-based security systems, such as intrusion detection
systems. The majority of this research demonstrates that it is possible to fool
a model using features extracted from a raw data source, but it does not take
into account the real implementation of such attacks, i.e., the reverse
transformation from theory to practice. The real implementation of these
adversarial attacks would be influenced by various constraints that would make
their execution more difficult. As a result, the purpose of this study was to
investigate the actual feasibility of adversarial attacks, specifically evasion
attacks, against network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDS),
demonstrating that it is entirely possible to fool these ML-based IDSs using
our proposed adversarial algorithm while assuming as many constraints as
possible in a black-box setting. In addition, since it is critical to design
defense mechanisms to protect ML-based IDSs against such attacks, a defensive
scheme is presented. Realistic botnet traffic traces are used to assess this
work. Our goal is to create adversarial botnet traffic that can avoid detection
while still performing all of its intended malicious functionality.

the detection of small masses down to single proton sensitivity. To obtain a
high enough throughput for the application in practical mass spectrometry, NEMS
resonators have to be arranged in two-dimensional (2D) arrays. However, all
state-of-the-art electromechanical transduction methods rely on electrical
lines placed close to the mechanical resonators, which drastically restricts
the density of 2D resonator arrays. An exception is the transduction by surface
acoustic waves (SAWs), which has so far only been shown for the transduction of
single nanomechanical pillar resonators. Here, we demonstrate the transduction
of pillar pairs by surface acoustic waves. The pillars have a diameter of 700
nm and show a mass responsivity of -588$\pm$98 ng$^{-1}$. The distances between
the pillar pairs are 70 nm and 14.3 $\mu$m. SAW transduction enabled us to
measure both pillars of each pair with electrical lines no closer than 300
$\mu$m, illustrating the potential of SAWs to transduce dense arrays of pillar
resonators, a crucial step towards practical mass spectrometry with NEMS.

GRB prompt phase as done in X-ray flares of GRBs. We obtain the differential
and cumulative distributions of 243 short GRB pulses, such as peak flux, FWHM,
rise time, decay time, and peak time in the fourth BATSE TTE Catalog with the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. It is found that these distributions
can be well described by power-law models. In particular, comparisons are made
in 182 short GRB pulses in the third Swift GRB Catalog from 2004 December to
2019 July. The results are essentially consistent with those in BATSE ones. We
notice that there is no obvious power-law index evolution across different
energy bands for either BATSE or Swift sGRBs. The joint analysis suggests that
GRB prompt phase can be explained by a Fractal-Diffusive, Self-Organized
Criticality (FD-SOC) system with the spatial dimension S = 3 and the classical

the Voronoi diagram of three sites. In a so-called admissible bisector system,
where Voronoi regions are connected and cover the plane, we prove that any

seen as an abstract dual version of Delaunay's theorem on (locally) empty
circles.
  Further, we define Voronoi-like cycles in an admissible bisector system, and
show that the Voronoi-like graph induced by such a cycle $C$ is a unique tree
(or a forest, if $C$ is unbounded). In the special case where $C$ is the
boundary of an abstract Voronoi region, the induced Voronoi-like graph can be
computed in expected linear time following the technique of [Junginger and
Papadopoulou SOCG'18]. Otherwise, within the same time, the algorithm
constructs the Voronoi-like graph of a cycle $C'$ on the same set (or subset)
of sites, which may equal $C$ or be enclosed by $C$. Overall, the technique
computes abstract Voronoi (or Voronoi-like) trees and forests in linear
expected time, given the order of their leaves along a Voronoi-like cycle. We
show a direct application in updating a constraint Delaunay triangulation in
linear expected time, after the insertion of a new segment constraint,
simplifying upon the result of [Shewchuk and Brown CGTA 2015].

heterogeneous Helmholtz equation is proposed. The ACMS method has originally
been introduced by Hetmaniuk and Lehoucq as a multiscale method to solve
elliptic partial differential equations. The ACMS method uses a domain
decomposition to separate the numerical approximation by splitting the
variational problem into two independent parts: local Helmholtz problems and a
global interface problem. While the former are naturally local and decoupled
such that they can be easily solved in parallel, the latter requires the
construction of suitable local basis functions relying on local eigenmodes and
suitable extensions. We carry out a full error analysis of this approach
focusing on the case where the domain decomposition is kept fixed, but the
number of eigenfunctions is increased. This complements related results for
elliptic problems where the focus is on the refinement of the domain
decomposition instead. The theoretical results in this work are supported by
numerical experiments verifying algebraic convergence for the interface
problems. In certain, practically relevant cases, even exponential convergence
for the local Helmholtz problems can be achieved without oversampling.

an entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware

gating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph
convolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing
because they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question

challenges for GBML to optimize the meta-knowledge by minimizing the sum of

a novel approach to homogenize OOD task gradients. RotoGBML uses reweighted
vectors to dynamically balance diverse magnitudes to a common scale and uses
rotation matrixes to rotate conflicting directions close to each other. To
reduce overhead, we homogenize gradients with the features rather than the
network parameters. On this basis, to avoid the intervention of non-causal
features (e.g., backgrounds), we also propose an invariant self-information
(ISI) module to extract invariant causal features (e.g., the outlines of
objects). Finally, task gradients are homogenized based on these invariant
causal features. Experiments show that RotoGBML outperforms other

reduce radiation dose and benefit clinical applications. Previous voxel-based
generation methods represent the CT as discrete voxels, resulting in high
memory requirements and limited spatial resolution due to the use of 3D
decoders. In this paper, we formulate the CT volume as a continuous intensity
field and develop a novel DIF-Net to perform high-quality CBCT reconstruction
from extremely sparse (fewer than 10) projection views at an ultrafast speed.
The intensity field of a CT can be regarded as a continuous function of 3D
spatial points. Therefore, the reconstruction can be reformulated as regressing
the intensity value of an arbitrary 3D point from given sparse projections.
Specifically, for a point, DIF-Net extracts its view-specific features from
different 2D projection views. These features are subsequently aggregated by a
fusion module for intensity estimation. Notably, thousands of points can be
processed in parallel to improve efficiency during training and testing. In
practice, we collect a knee CBCT dataset to train and evaluate DIF-Net.
Extensive experiments show that our approach can reconstruct CBCT with high
image quality and high spatial resolution from extremely sparse views within
1.6 seconds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code

susceptible to distribution shift. This is especially inappropriate for
data-starved hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration. To tackle this problem,
this work puts forth a self-supervised diffusion model for HSI restoration,
namely Denoising Diffusion Spatio-Spectral Model (\texttt{DDS2M}), which works
by inferring the parameters of the proposed Variational Spatio-Spectral Module
(VS2M) during the reverse diffusion process, solely using the degraded HSI
without any extra training data. In VS2M, a variational inference-based loss
function is customized to enable the untrained spatial and spectral networks to
learn the posterior distribution, which serves as the transitions of the
sampling chain to help reverse the diffusion process. Benefiting from its
self-supervised nature and the diffusion process, \texttt{DDS2M} enjoys
stronger generalization ability to various HSIs compared to existing
diffusion-based methods and superior robustness to noise compared to existing
HSI restoration methods. Extensive experiments on HSI denoising, noisy HSI

revealed. The results show that the surface of the CoFeSiBNb$_3$ metallic
microfibers after AC current annealing is smooth and continuous; its general
magnetic properties and MI ratio increase at first with current intensity and
then decrease at higher intensities. During the current annealing process,
Joule heat eliminates residual stresses in the microfibers while forming
atomically ordered micro-domains, which improves the degree of its
organizational order. Meanwhile, a stable toroidal magnetic field is generated,
which promotes the distribution of the magnetic domain structure of the

crystallinity of the Fe3O4 phase, identified in changes in the magnetization as
a function of annealing time. A critical annealing time of approximately 3
hours maximized the presence of both phases, as observed via an enhancement in
the magnetization and an interfacial pinning effect. This is attributed to
disordered spins separating the magnetically distinct phases which tend to
align with the application of a magnetic field at high temperatures. The
increased antiferromagnetic phase can be distinguished due to the field-induced
metamagnetic transitions observed in structures annealed for more than 3 hours

study in determining the changes in volume fractions with annealing time will
enable precise control over phase tunability in iron oxide nanorods, allowing

addition to bipartite entanglement, we achieve mirror-cavity-mirror tripartite

the frequency of two rotating mirrors. Furthermore, for two rotating mirrors,
quantum steering is found to be asymmetric both one-way and two-way. As a

gyro-radius is comparable to magnetic field line curvature radius, and the
conservation of the first adiabatic invariant is broken. As a collision-less
particle scattering mechanism, FLCS plays a vital role in affecting the
distribution of energetic electrons in the radiation belt, precipitation of
ring current ions, and the formation of proton isotropic boundary(IB). In
recent years, it has been increasingly used in research on particle dynamics.
Previous studies focused on quantifying the effects of curvature scattering in
a single case. This paper uses the analytic model to calculate the spatial
distribution of diffusion coefficients induced by FLCS in a real magnetic field
model. Various energy particles are used to analyze the coverage of curvature
scattering in radial and MLT directions, as well as the influence of $Kp$
index. The decay time of particles due to curvature scattering is estimated
based on diffusion coefficients which suggest that the time scale of curvature
scattering is too long to explain the rapid loss of electrons in the radiation
belt and the ring current with the energy of MeV or below MeV. However, the
decay time of ring current protons is on the order of hours or even minutes
which can be used to explain the ring current decay during the recovery phase
of magnetic storm. Finally, the effects of resonant wave-particle scattering
and FLCS in the vicinity of the midnight equator are briefly compared. It is
found that the influence of FLCS on hundred-keV protons in the ring current
region is comparable to or even greater than that of EMIC wave scattering. Our
results suggest the non-negligible effects of the FLCS and should be considered
in radiation belt and ring current modeling.

This paper proposes a self-planning code generation method with large language

  cosmic ray flow from Mexico-city Neutron Monitor","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.EP physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We look for a diurnal anisotropy in the cosmic ray flow, using the
Mexico-City Neutron Monitor (NM) detector, due to the Earth's orbital motion
and predicted by Compton-Getting (C-G) in 1935, as a first-order relativistic
effect. The Mexico-City NM's geographic latitude is not very high
($19.33^{\circ}$N), and it has a high cutoff geomagnetic rigidity (8.2 GV) and
mountain altitude (2274 m asl) favoring the observation of the C-G effect.
Furthermore, during the solar cycle minima, the galactic cosmic ray flux is
maxima, and the solar magnetic field gets weakened, with a dipolar pattern. Its
influence on cosmic rays reaching Earth is the smallest. Analysis of the
combined counting rate during two solar minima, 2008 and 2019, from Mexico-city
NM's data yields the C-G effect with an amplitude variation of (0.043$\pm$
0.019)\%, and phase of (6.15$\pm$ 1.71) LT. The expected amplitude variation is
0.044\%, and the phase of 6.00 LT.

waves. We considered the following problems: (i) The composition of the CTS
(""Scientific Technical Committee""), which was composed entirely of doctors,
mainly virologists, without mathematical epidemiologists, statisticians,
physicists, etc. In fact, a pandemic has a behavior described by mathematical,
stochastic and probabilistic criteria; (ii) Political interference in security
measures and media propaganda; (iii) The initial stages of the vaccination
campaign, ignoring the age factor, and (iv) The persistence of the pandemic due
to the population unvaccinated (anti-vax or ""no-vax""), which amounts to about
six to seven million people, including 10% of anti-vax doctors.

  inefficiencies of soccer betting","25 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph math.PR physics.pop-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In economy, markets are denoted as efficient when it is impossible to
systematically generate profits which outperform the average. In the past
years, the concept has been tested in other domains such as the growing sports
betting market. Surprisingly, despite its large size and its level of maturity,
sports betting shows traits of inefficiency. The anomalies indicate the
existence of strategies which shift betting from a game of chance towards a
game of skill. This article shows an example for an inefficiency detected in
the German soccer betting TOTO 13er Wette, which is operated by state-run
lottery agencies. Gamblers have to guess the outcome (win, draw, loss) of 13
soccer matches listed on a lottery tip. Applying stochastic methods, a recipe
is presented to determine hit rates for single match outcomes. More important,
the recipe provides the number of lottery tips required to achieve a specific
number of strikes (number of correct match forecasts per lottery tip) for any
given level of safety. An approximation is derived to cope with large numbers
in hypergeometric distributions, valid under certain constraints. Overall, the
strategy does lead to returns exceeding the aggregated lottery fees, resulting
in moderate, but consistent profits. It is briefly discussed if lessions
learned from soccer betting can be transferred back to financial markets,
because gamblers and retail investors face similar challenges and
opportunities.

  Society of Mechanical, Shiraz, Iran, 2012",,,,"physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In this article, the model presented by Shen and Pierre to investigate the
transverse vibration behavior of a simply supported beam has been revised. This
is done by applying more realistic assumptions. The crack is modeled as a
continuous disturbance and the disturbance function is provided based on
fracture mechanics. Next, the natural frequencies corresponding to the model
are extracted using the Galerkin method. The effect of crack parameters on the
vibration behavior of the cracked beam is investigated. The obtained results
show that the natural frequencies of the beam decrease with increasing crack
depth. At the end, the obtained results are compared with the experimental
results. The results show that the presented model is improved compared to
previous models and predicts the vibration behavior of cracked beams with
better accuracy for different crack parameters.

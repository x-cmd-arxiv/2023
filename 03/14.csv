in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual
information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data.
However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more
challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is
the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the
model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In
this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language
models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on
a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our
research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models,
understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the
trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will
inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale
vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.

it remains challenging to estimate the distillable entanglement and its closely
related essential quantity, the quantum capacity of a noisy quantum channel. In
this work, we propose methods for evaluating both quantities by squeezing out
useless entanglement within a state or a quantum channel, whose contributions
are expected to be ignored for the distillable entanglement or the quantum
capacity, respectively. We first consider a general resource measure called the
reverse divergence of resources to quantify the minimum divergence between a
target state and the set of free states. We then introduce the reverse
max-relative entropy of entanglement and apply it to establish efficiently
computable upper bounds on the distillable entanglement. We also extend the
reverse divergence of resources to quantum channels and derive upper bounds on
the quantum capacity. We further apply our method to investigate purifying the
maximally entangled states under practical noises, such as depolarizing and
amplitude damping noises, and notably establish improvements in estimating the
one-way distillable entanglement. Our bounds also offer useful benchmarks for
evaluating the quantum capacities of qubit quantum channels of interest,

most natural type of repetition in strings. The basic algorithmic question
concerning squares is to check if a given string of length $n$ is square-free,
that is, does not contain a fragment of such form. Main and Lorentz [J.
Algorithms 1984] designed an $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time algorithm for this
problem, and proved a matching lower bound assuming the so-called general
alphabet, meaning that the algorithm is only allowed to check if two characters
are equal. However, their lower bound also assumes that there are $\Omega(n)$
distinct symbols in the string. As an open question, they asked if there is a
faster algorithm if one restricts the size of the alphabet. Crochemore [Theor.
Comput. Sci. 1986] designed a linear-time algorithm for constant-size
alphabets, and combined with more recent results his approach in fact implies
such an algorithm for linearly-sortable alphabets. Very recently, Ellert and
Fischer [ICALP 2021] significantly relaxed this assumption by designing a
linear-time algorithm for general ordered alphabets, that is, assuming a linear
order on the characters that permits constant time order comparisons. However,
the open question of Main and Lorentz from 1984 remained unresolved for general
(unordered) alphabets. In this paper, we show that testing square-freeness of a
length-$n$ string over general alphabet of size $\sigma$ can be done with
$\mathcal{O}(n\log \sigma)$ comparisons, and cannot be done with $o(n\log
\sigma)$ comparisons. We complement this result with an $\mathcal{O}(n\log
\sigma)$ time algorithm in the Word RAM model. Finally, we extend the algorithm
to reporting all the runs (maximal repetitions) in the same complexity.

the combination of log data embedding strategies and DL types for failure

various configurations of embedding strategies and DL-based encoders. To
further investigate how dataset characteristics such as dataset size and

concentration and hydrophobicity only when the temperature is raised above the
microgel volume phase transition temperature $T_c$, namely when microgels
collapse, they are partially hydrophobic and form a volume-spanning colloidal
gel. We find that the original gel is strengthened close to the isoelectric

hydrophobicity rules the gel strengthening at very high PE concentrations.
Surprisingly, we find that polyelectrolyte adsorption or partial embedding of
PE chains inside the microgel periphery occurs also when anionic polymers of
polystyrene sulfonate with high degree of sulfonation are added. This gives
rise to colloidal stabilization and to the melting of the original gel network
above $T_c$. Contrastingly, the presence of polyelectrolytes in suspensions of
swollen, jammed microgels results in a weak softening of the original repulsive
glass, even when an apparent isoelectric condition is met. Our study puts
forward the crucial role of electrostatics in thermosensitive microgels,
unveiling an exciting new way to tailor the flow of these soft colloids and

highest-resolution run of the IllustrisTNG suite. Comparing integrated
quantities such as the HI mass function, we study to what detail the UV field

then evaluate new, spatially resolved comparisons for cold gas in galaxies by
exploring synthetic maps of atomic hydrogen at redshift zero and compare them
to 21-cm observations of local galaxies from the WHISP survey. In terms of
non-parametric morphologies, we find that TNG50 HI maps are less concentrated
than their WHISP counterparts (median $\Delta C\approx0.3$), due in part to
central HI deficits related to the ejective character of supermassive black
hole feedback in TNG. In terms of the HI column density distribution function,
we find discrepancies between WHISP and IllustrisTNG that depend on the total

quantitative studies show that women often report a lower level of physics
perceived recognition, self-efficacy and interest. In this study, we analyzed
data from individual interviews with 38 female students to investigate their
learning experiences in physics courses in order to obtain a qualitative
understanding of the factors that shape their self-efficacy and interest. We
find that female students' negative and positive perceived recognition from

women reported that they felt belittled for their questions or efforts in
physics courses, which often negatively influenced their self-efficacy. These
findings can help physics educators develop better ways to interact with

acknowledging students' efforts and questions, expressing faith in students'
ability to excel, and being careful not to give unintended messages to

meaningfully consent, participants wanted changes to the technology and to the

the stock prices of the holding companies and their subsidiaries. The strongest
positive correlation was observed between BHIT and BMTR, while the weakest
correlations were found between BHIT and IPTV, and BHIT and MSIN. The
correlations were also found to have changed over time, possibly due to market
conditions, company-specific events, or changes in industry sectors.In the case
of Emtek Group, the analysis suggested that EMTK's stock price movements had a
significant impact on the stock prices of its subsidiaries, with varying
strengths of relationships. The negative correlation between EMTK and SCMA over
the entire period suggested an inverse relationship, while positive
correlations with BUKA, AMOR, BBHI, and RSGK indicated a tendency to move in
the same direction as EMTK's stock price. The correlations were found to have
increased over time, possibly due to market conditions and EMTK's ownership
stake in these companies. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that
there is a complex interplay between the stock prices of parent companies and
their subsidiaries, and that there are a variety of factors that can influence
these relationships over time. These findings may be useful for investors in
making informed decisions about their investment portfolios, as changes in the
correlations could impact their portfolio's performance.

variables. The main idea is to ``pretend'' that the random variables are
independent and pay a multiplicative price measuring how far they are from
actually being independent. This price is encapsulated in the Hellinger
integral between the joint and the product of the marginals, which is then
upper bounded leveraging tensorisation properties. Our bounds represent a
natural generalisation of concentration inequalities in the presence of
dependence: we recover exactly the classical bounds (McDiarmid's inequality)
when the random variables are independent. Furthermore, in a ``large
deviations'' regime, we obtain the same decay in the probability as for the
independent case, even when the random variables display non-trivial
dependencies. To show this, we consider a number of applications of interest.
First, we provide a bound for Markov chains with finite state space. Then, we
consider the Simple Symmetric Random Walk, which is a non-contracting Markov
chain, and a non-Markovian setting in which the stochastic process depends on
its entire past. To conclude, we propose an application to Markov Chain Monte
Carlo methods, where our approach leads to an improved lower bound on the
minimum burn-in period required to reach a certain accuracy. In all of these
settings, we provide a regime of parameters in which our bound fares better
than what the state of the art can provide.

by complex factors such as absorption, shadowing, and reflection, making it
very challengeable to achieve effective underwater visible light communication
(UVLC) channel estimation. It is difficult for the UVLC channel to be sparse
represented in the time and frequency domains, which limits the chance of using
sparse signal processing techniques to achieve better performance of channel
estimation. To this end, a compressed sensing (CS) based framework is
established in this paper by fully exploiting the sparsity of the underwater
visible light channel in the distance domain of the propagation links. In order
to solve the sparse recovery problem and achieve more accurate UVLC channel
estimation, a sparse learning based underwater visible light channel estimation
(SL-UVCE) scheme is proposed. Specifically, a deep-unfolding neural network
mimicking the classical iterative sparse recovery algorithm of approximate
message passing (AMP) is employed, which decomposes the iterations of AMP into
a series of layers with different learnable parameters. Compared with the
existing non-CS-based and CS-based schemes, the proposed scheme shows better
performance of accuracy in channel estimation, especially in severe conditions
such as insufficient measurement pilots and large number of multipath
components.

  existence in prey-predator dynamics with contaminated and uncontaminated prey",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In freshwater ecosystems, aquatic insects that ontogenetically shift their
habitat from aquatic to terrestrial play vital roles as prey subsidies that
move nutrients and energy from aquatic to terrestrial food webs. As a result,
these subsidies negatively affect alternative terrestrial prey by enhancing
predator density. However, these aquatic insects can also transport
contamination to the terrestrial community that is primarily produced in
aquatic ecosystems. Which can reduce insectivore abundance and biomass, lower
insectivore reproductive success, and increase predation pressure on
alternative prey with consequences for aquatic and terrestrial food webs.
Motivated by this, here we consider a prey-predator model where the predator
consumes contaminated and uncontaminated prey together. We find that, at a high
level of contamination, the vulnerability of contaminated prey and predator is
determined by predation preference. More specifically, a very low predation
preference towards contaminated prey ensures predator persistence, whereas a
low, high preference excludes the predator from the system. Interestingly,
either contaminated prey or the predator exist at intermediate predation
preference due to bi-stability. Furthermore, when there is no contamination in
one of the prey, the other prey can not coexist due to apparent competition for
a specific range of predation preferences. However, when sufficient
contamination exists in one prey, alternative uncontaminated prey coexists.
With this, contamination also stabilizes and destabilizes the three species
dynamics. Our result also indicates that if the intensity of the contamination
in predator reproduction is low, then contaminated prey is more susceptible to
the contamination.

dipole plasma gradient results in a dipole component of the wakefield. Analysis
suggests that, despite the asymmetry, the instability due to the fixed
transverse plasma gradient is unlikely, as the total wakefield has a single

spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) and angle-resolved

higher and lower-dimensional density waves in CsV3Sb5 is intimately tied to a
set of small reconstructed Fermi pockets. ARPES measurements visualize the
formation of these pockets generated by a 3D charge density wave transition.
The pockets are connected by dispersive q* wave vectors observed in Fourier
transforms of STM differential conductance maps. As the additional 1D charge
order emerges at a lower temperature, q* wave vectors become substantially
renormalized, signaling further reconstruction of the Fermi pockets.
Remarkably, in the superconducting state, the superconducting gap modulations
give rise to an in-plane Cooper pair-density-wave at the same q* wave vectors.
Our work demonstrates the intrinsic origin of the charge-stripes and the
pair-density-wave in CsV3Sb5 and their relationship to the Fermi pockets. These
experiments uncover a unique scenario of how Fermi pockets generated by a
parent charge density wave state can provide a favorable platform for the
emergence of additional density waves.

entropy is generally the so-called improved Noether charge, a quantity that has
recently been investigated by many authors, associated to null future-pointing
diffeomorphisms. These local and dynamical definitions of entropy on the black
hole horizon differ from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy through terms
proportional to the first derivative of the area along the null geodesics. Two
different definitions of the dynamical entropy are identified, deduced from
gravity symplectic potentials providing a suitable notion of gravitational flux
which vanish on non-expanding horizons. The first one is proposed as a
definition of the entropy for dynamical black holes by Wald and Zhang, and it
satisfies the physical process first law locally. The second one vanishes on
any cross section of Minkowski's light cone. I study general properties of its
balance law. In particular, I look at first order perturbations around a non
expanding horizon. Furthermore, I show that the dynamical entropy increases on
the event horizon formed by a spherical symmetric collapse between the two
stationary states of vanishing flux, i.e the initial flat light cone and the
final stationary black hole. I compare this process to a phase transition, in
which the symmetry group of the stationary black hole phase is enlarged by the
supertranslations.

reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learn the robot policy. In contrast to
the dialog systems, our agent is trained with a simulator developed by using
human data and can deal with multiple modalities such as language and physical
actions. We conducted a human study to evaluate the performance of the system
in the interaction with a user. Our designed system shows promising preliminary
results when it is used by a real user.

rely on confidence-based pseudo-labeling with consistency regularization. To
obtain high-quality pseudo-labels, a high confidence threshold is typically
adopted. However, it has been shown that softmax-based confidence scores in
deep networks can be arbitrarily high for samples far from the training data,
and thus, the pseudo-labels for even high-confidence unlabeled samples may
still be unreliable. In this work, we present a new perspective of
pseudo-labeling for imbalanced SSL. Without relying on model confidence, we
propose to measure whether an unlabeled sample is likely to be
``in-distribution''; i.e., close to the current training data. To decide
whether an unlabeled sample is ``in-distribution'' or ``out-of-distribution'',
we adopt the energy score from out-of-distribution detection literature. As
training progresses and more unlabeled samples become in-distribution and
contribute to training, the combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data can better
approximate the true class distribution to improve the model. Experiments
demonstrate that our energy-based pseudo-labeling method, \textbf{InPL}, albeit
conceptually simple, significantly outperforms confidence-based methods on
imbalanced SSL benchmarks. For example, it produces around 3\% absolute
accuracy improvement on CIFAR10-LT. When combined with state-of-the-art
long-tailed SSL methods, further improvements are attained. In particular, in
one of the most challenging scenarios, InPL achieves a 6.9\% accuracy
improvement over the best competitor.

dynamics can be described through a mean-field theory, which predicts a great
enhancement in the average speed. In fact, beyond a critical value of the
coupling strength, noise activation becomes irrelevant and the dynamics switch
to an effectively deterministic ""running"" mode. Finally, we study the
stochastic thermodynamics of the coupled oscillators, in particular their

not able to specify all criteria of the desired solution. Motivated by an
application in the field of system identification, we initiate the algorithmic
study of $k$-DIVERSE MINIMUM $s$-$t$ CUTS which, given a directed graph $G =
(V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \in V$, and an integer $k > 0$, asks for a
collection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We
investigate the complexity of the problem for two diversity measures for a
collection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, and (ii) the
cardinality of the union of cuts in the collection. We prove that $k$-DIVERSE
MINIMUM $s$-$t$ CUTS can be solved in strongly polynomial time for both
diversity measures via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result
by establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$
cuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only
collections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical
algorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts.
For graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single
max-flow computation. These results stand in contrast to the problem of finding
$k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the
disjoint case (Hanaka et al., 2022) -- and partially answer a long-standing

nets, by allowing the condensation of arbitrary abelian bosons, including
chiral bosons in string nets constructed from (for example) Chern-Simons
theories, which describe time-reversal invariant bilayer states. This gives a
method for obtaining the full data for string nets without explicit
time-reversal symmetry from such bilayer models. We illustrate our approach
with several examples.

breakthrough in Natural Learning Processing (NLP) tasks across multiple

performance of four different types of well-known state-of-the-art transformer
models for text classification. Models such as Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT), Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training
Approach (RoBERTa), a distilled version of BERT (DistilBERT), and a large
bidirectional neural network architecture (XLNet) were proposed. The
performance of the four models that were used to detect disaster in the text
was compared. All the models performed well enough, indicating that
transformer-based models are suitable for the detection of disaster in text.
The RoBERTa transformer model performs best on the test dataset with a score of
82.6% and is highly recommended for quality predictions. Furthermore, we
discovered that the learning algorithms' performance was influenced by the
pre-processing techniques, the nature of words in the vocabulary, unbalanced
labeling, and the model parameters.

fields distributed uniformly across the sky as part of the daily search for
small bodies and 21 archival fields located within 5 deg from the ecliptic

identified 400 known objects of different dynamical classes from Inner
Main-belt Asteroids to Jupiter Trojans and 43 potentially new small bodies with
no priors on their motion. We were able to reach limiting magnitude for unknown
objects of $V$=23.8 mag, and a retrieval rate of $\sim$80% for objects with
$V<$22 mag and $V<$23.5 mag for the daily and archival searches, respectively.
SPECULOOS and similar exoplanet surveys can thus serve as pencil-beam surveys

discs decreases by several orders of magnitude on a timescale of a few million
years. This decrease in the mass budget of solids is likely due to the
gas-drag-induced radial drift of mm-sized solids, called pebbles. However,
quantifying the evolution of this dust component in young stellar clusters is
difficult due to the inherent large spread in stellar masses and formation
times. Therefore, we aim to model the collective evolution of a cluster to
investigate the effectiveness of radial drift in clearing the discs of mm-sized
particles. We use a protoplanetary disc model that numerically solves for disc
formation, and the viscous evolution and photoevaporative clearing of the gas
component, while also including the drift of particles limited in size by
fragmentation. We find that discs are born with dust masses between 50 Earth
masses and 1000 Earth masses, for stars with, respectively, masses between 0.1
solar masses and 1 solar masses. The majority of this initial dust reservoir is
typically lost through drift before photoevaporation opens a gap in the gas
disc for models both with and without strong X-ray-driven mass loss rates. We
conclude that the decrease in time of the mass locked in fragmentation-limited
pebbles is consistent with the evolution of dust masses and ages inferred from
nearby star-forming regions when assuming viscous evolution rates corresponding
to mean gas disc lifetimes between 3 Myr and 8 Myr.

Determination of the terminal distribution of stresses has been thereby linked

(i) import an off-the-shelf pretrained (masked) language model; (ii) append a
multilayer perceptron atop the CLS token's hidden representation (with randomly
initialized weights); and (iii) fine-tune the entire model on a downstream task
(MLP). This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks,
but these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations, such
as word-level synonym substitutions. In this work, we demonstrate surprising
gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by Model-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an
alternative method of adapting to downstream tasks. Rather than modifying the
model (by appending an MLP head), MVP instead modifies the input (by appending
a prompt template). Across three classification datasets, MVP improves
performance against adversarial word-level synonym substitutions by an average
of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial training-based
state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial training, we
achieve further improvements in robust accuracy while maintaining clean

clustering criteria, e.g. ""decisiveness"" and ""fairness"". All existing
self-labeled losses incorporate Shannon's cross-entropy term targeting the

two random variables represented by distributions softmax and y. We show that
our loss satisfies some properties of a generalized cross-entropy.
Interestingly, it agrees with the Shannon's cross-entropy for one-hot
pseudo-labels y, but the training from softer labels weakens. For example, if y
is a uniform distribution at some data point, it has zero contribution to the
training. Our self-labeling loss combining collision cross entropy with basic
clustering criteria is convex w.r.t. pseudo-labels, but non-trivial to optimize
over the probability simplex. We derive a practical EM algorithm optimizing

Establishing the hierarchy members at non-negative orders, involves proving the

the minimum sensing path planning problem as an optimization problem. For this
formulation, we introduce a new safety constraint to impose a bound on the
probability of collision with obstacles in continuous-time, in contrast to the
common discrete-time approach. The problem is amenable to solution via the
convex-concave procedure (CCP). We develop a CCP algorithm for the formulated

tone mapping has been widely explored, video tone mapping is lagging behind,
especially for the deep-learning-based methods, due to the lack of HDR-LDR

propose domain and instance based contrastive learning loss. Instead of using a
universal feature extractor, such as VGG to extract the features for similarity
measurement, we propose a novel latent code, which is an aggregation of the
brightness and contrast of extracted features, to measure the similarity of
different pairs. We totally construct two negative pairs and three positive
pairs to constrain the latent codes of tone mapped results. For video tone
mapping, we propose a temporal-feature-replaced (TFR) module to efficiently

  We find conditions on the Weyl tensor and the Bach tensor for a Lorentzian
conformal four-manifold equipped with a twisting non-shearing congruence of
null geodesics to be locally conformally isometric to such a perturbed
Fefferman space.
  We investigate the existence of metrics in the perturbed Fefferman conformal
class satisfying appropriate sub-conditions of the Einstein equations, such as
the so-called pure radiation equations. These metrics are defined only off
cross-sections of Fefferman's circle bundle, and are conveniently expressed in
terms of densities that generalise Gover's notion of almost Einstein scales.
Our setup allows us to reduce the prescriptions on the Ricci tensor to the
underlying CR three-manifold in terms of differential constraints on a complex
density and the CR data of the perturbation one-form. One such constraint turns
out to arise from a non-linear, or gauged, analogue of a second-order
differential operator on densities. A solution thereof provides a criterion for
the existence of a CR function and, under certain conditions, for the
realisability of the CR three-manifold. These findings are consistent with
previous works by Lewandowski, Nurowski, Tafel, Hill, and independently, by
Mason.
  We also provide an analysis of the Weyl curvature of such conformal

stratifications (corresponding to the bump luminosity and the tip of the RGB).
Our RGB tip simulations can be directly performed at the nominal luminosity,
circumventing the need for extrapolations to lower luminosities. A rich,
continuous spectrum of IGWs is observed, with a significant amount of total
power contained at high wavenumbers. By following the time evolution of a
passive dye in the stable layers, we find that IGW mixing in our simulations is
weaker than predicted by a simple analytical prescription based on shear mixing
and not efficient enough to explain the missing RGB extra mixing. However, we
may be underestimating the efficiency of IGW mixing given that our simulations
include a limited portion of the convective envelope. Quadrupling its radial
extent compared to our fiducial setup increases convective velocities by up to
a factor 2 and IGW velocities by up to a factor 4. We also report the formation

to address this by forcing models to extrapolate spatially when predicting the

  We conducted simulations to compare model performance estimates produced by
five common CV methods fit to spatially structured data. We found spatial CV

particularly when approaches which combined assessment sets of spatially
conjunct observations with spatial exclusion buffers. To facilitate use of
these techniques, we introduce the `spatialsample` package which provides

performance. Its success cannot be achieved without the re-introduction of
multi-scale feature fusion in the encoder. However, the excessively increased
tokens in multi-scale features, especially for about 75\% of low-level
features, are quite computationally inefficient, which hinders real
applications of DETR models. In this paper, we present Lite DETR, a simple yet
efficient end-to-end object detection framework that can effectively reduce the
GFLOPs of the detection head by 60\% while keeping 99\% of the original
performance. Specifically, we design an efficient encoder block to update
high-level features (corresponding to small-resolution feature maps) and
low-level features (corresponding to large-resolution feature maps) in an
interleaved way. In addition, to better fuse cross-scale features, we develop a
key-aware deformable attention to predict more reliable attention weights.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed Lite DETR, and the efficient encoder strategy can generalize well
across existing DETR-based models. The code will be available in

However, current HPS benchmarks are mostly designed to test models in scenarios

real-world applications when the observed data differs significantly from the
training data and hence is out-of-distribution (OOD). It is therefore important
to test and improve the OOD robustness of HPS methods. To address this
fundamental problem, we develop a simulator that can be controlled in a
fine-grained manner using interpretable parameters to explore the manifold of
images of human pose, e.g. by varying poses, shapes, and clothes. We introduce
a learning-based testing method, termed PoseExaminer, that automatically
diagnoses HPS algorithms by searching over the parameter space of human pose
images to find the failure modes. Our strategy for exploring this
high-dimensional parameter space is a multi-agent reinforcement learning
system, in which the agents collaborate to explore different parts of the
parameter space. We show that our PoseExaminer discovers a variety of
limitations in current state-of-the-art models that are relevant in real-world
scenarios but are missed by current benchmarks. For example, it finds large
regions of realistic human poses that are not predicted correctly, as well as
reduced performance for humans with skinny and corpulent body shapes. In

without forgetting old ones. Traditional CIL models are trained from scratch to
continually acquire knowledge as data evolves. Recently, pre-training has
achieved substantial progress, making vast pre-trained models (PTMs) accessible
for CIL. Contrary to traditional methods, PTMs possess generalizable
embeddings, which can be easily transferred. In this work, we revisit CIL with
PTMs and argue that the core factors in CIL are adaptivity for model updating
and generalizability for knowledge transferring. 1) We first reveal that frozen
PTM can already provide generalizable embeddings for CIL. Surprisingly, a
simple baseline (SimpleCIL) which continually sets the classifiers of PTM to
prototype features can beat state-of-the-art even without training on the
downstream task. 2) Due to the distribution gap between pre-trained and
downstream datasets, PTM can be further cultivated with adaptivity via model
adapting. We propose ADapt And Merge (ADAM), which aggregates the embeddings of
PTM and adapted models for classifier construction. ADAM is a general framework
that can be orthogonally combined with any parameter-efficient tuning method,
which holds the advantages of PTM's generalizability and adapted model's
adaptivity. 3) Additionally, we find previous benchmarks are unsuitable in the
era of PTM due to data overlapping and propose four new benchmarks for
assessment, namely ImageNet-A, ObjectNet, OmniBenchmark, and VTAB. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of ADAM with a unified and concise

many physical processes. This makes it difficult to perform the conventional
statistical analysis using the likelihood-based Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, which scales poorly with the dimensionality of the parameter space. In
this paper, we show how the Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) through Marginal

the sampling cost exponentially grows with the number of cuts, and thus it is
practically important to develop decomposition methods working with smaller

that the target to cut is the identity channel acting on multiple qubits in

that emergent long range interaction between charge defects leads to
characteristic structures with distinct length scales, where they can be
controlled via the ratio of interaction strengths. In this context, the spin
ice phase is the dilute gas of weakly interacting charges, whereas, the
macroscopic population of charge defects naturally develops charge ordering for
large Coulomb interaction limit. Interestingly, we find that the competing spin
interactions could naturally give rise to stabilize the mosaic structure of
charge defects in the absence of uniform ordering. They are characterized by
liquid-like correlations having a finite length scale. The emergence of such
intermediate order in the mosaic structure is confirmed by both dynamical and
static correlations. By establishing the microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we also
present the distinctive signatures in static spin correlation to detect such
spatial structure of charge defects. We speculate that the domain pattern of

secondary star (M$_{\rm initial} \sim 4-5M_{\odot}$, M$_{\rm current} \sim
1-2M_{\odot}$) with a more massive, yet luminous companion (the primary). Upon
reanalysis of the MUSE spectra, we found that the radial velocity variations
originally reported were underestimated ($K_{\rm 2,revised} = 176\pm3$km/s vs
$K_{\rm 2,original} = 140\pm3$km/s) because of the weighting scheme adopted in
the full-spectrum fitting analysis. The increased radial velocity
semi-amplitude translates into a system mass function larger than previously
deduced ($f_{\rm revised}$=2.83$M_{\odot}$ vs $f_{\rm

technique, we place an upper limit of 10\% of a luminous primary source to the
observed optical light in NGC1850 BH1, assuming that the primary and secondary
are the only components contributing to the system. Furthermore, by analysing
archival near-infrared data, we find clues to the presence of an accretion disk

do not provide a definitive answer whether the unseen component in NGC1850 BH1
is indeed a black hole. These results predict a scenario where, if a primary
luminous source of mass M $\ge 4.7M_{\odot}$, is present in the system (given

which the gas, based on previous observations, lies in a cold rotating disk. We
measured the metal masses using either the submillimetre line or continuum
emission from three tracers of the overall metal content - carbon atoms, carbon
monoxide molecules and dust grains - using the first calibration of this
technique that treats all three tracers simultaneously (Dunne et al. 2022). We
obtain very similar mass estimates from the different tracers, which are
similar to the entire metal content of a present-day massive early-type galaxy.
We used the dynamical masses of these galaxies to set an upper limit on the
mass of the interstellar medium in each galaxy, allowing us to set a lower
limit on the metal abundance of the ISM, finding values for many of the
galaxies well above the solar value. The only caveat to this result is that we
cannot be certain for all galaxies that the emission from the tracer comes from
within the region covered by the dynamical analysis. Our high values for the
metal abundance are supported by a recent JWST study of one galaxy which found
a super-solar metal abundance approximately 3 times greater than our lower
limit. Using two chemical evolution models, we show that the high metal masses
and metal abundances are what is expected shortly after the formation of a
galaxy for a top-heavy IMF. We suggest a scenario for galaxy evolution in which
massive galaxies reach a high metal abundance during their formation phase,
which is then gradually reduced by dry mergers with lower mass galaxies. We use
the chemical-evolution models to show that the metals in the outflows from
massive early-type galaxies in their formation phase can quantitatively explain
the long-standing puzzle that approximately 75% of the metals in clusters of
galaxies is in the intracluster gas rather than in the galaxies.

  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fraction of ionizing photons that escape their host galaxies to ionize
hydrogen in the inter-galactic medium (IGM) is a critical parameter in analyses
of the reionization era. In this paper we use the Meraxes semi-analytic galaxy
formation model to infer the mean ionizing photon escape fraction and its
dependence on galaxy properties through joint modelling of the observed high
redshift galaxy population and existing constraints on the reionization
history. Using a Bayesian framework, and under the assumption that escape
fraction is primarily related to halo mass, we find that the joint constraints
of the UV luminosity function, CMB optical depth, and the Ly$\alpha$ forest
require an escape fraction of $(18\pm5)\%$ for galaxies within haloes of
$M\lesssim10^{9}$M$_\odot$ and $(5\pm2)\%$ for more massive haloes. When
considered with respect to galaxy properties, we find that the transition from
values of escape fraction from $\sim18\%$ to $\sim5\%$ occurs at stellar masses
of $M_\star\sim10^7$M$_\odot$, nearly independent of redshift. As a function of
redshift, we find that reionization is dominated by the smaller
$M_\star\lesssim10^7$M$_\odot$ galaxies with high escape fractions at
$z\gtrsim6$, and by the larger $M_\star\gtrsim10^7$M$_\odot$ galaxies with
lower escape fractions at $z\lesssim6$. Galaxies with star formation rates of
$10^{-2.5}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-1.5}$M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$ provide the
dominant source of ionizing photons throughout reionization. Our results are
consistent with recent direct measurements of a $\sim5\%$ escape fraction from
massive galaxies at the end of reionization, and support recent findings using
both hydrodynamic simulations and direct observations which indicate that the
dominant sources of escaping ionizing photons during reionization are low mass

lifted sluice gates from both a mathematical and numerical perspective in the
context of the Shallow water Equations (SWE). First, an improved exact solution
of the dam-break problem is presented, assuming (i) the dependence of the gate
contraction coefficient on the upstream flow depth, and (ii) a physically
congruent definition for the submerged flow equation. It is shown that a
relevant solution always exists for any set of initial conditions, but there
are also initial conditions for which the solution is multiple. In the last
case, a novel disambiguation criterion based on the continuous dependence of
the solution on the initial conditions is used to select the physically
congruent one among the alternatives. Secondly, a one (1-d) and a
two-dimensional (2-d) form of a SWE Finite Volume numerical model, equipped
with an approximate Riemann solver for the sluice gate treatment at cells
interfaces, are presented. It is shown that the numerical implementation of
classic steady state gate equations (classic equilibrium approach) leads to
unsatisfactory numerical results in the case of fast transients, while a novel
relaxed version of these equations (non-equilibrium approach) supplies very
satisfactory results both in the 1-d and 2-d case. In particular, the 1-d
numerical model is tested against (i) the proposed novel exact solutions and
(ii) recent dam-break laboratory results. The 2-d model is verified by means of
a test in a realistic detention basin for flood regulation, demonstrating that
the novel findings can be promptly applied in real-world cases.

  available at the 39th International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG
  2023)",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  For a drawing of a labeled graph, the rotation of a vertex or crossing is the
cyclic order of its incident edges, represented by the labels of their other
endpoints. The extended rotation system (ERS) of the drawing is the collection
of the rotations of all vertices and crossings. A drawing is simple if each
pair of edges has at most one common point. Gioan's Theorem states that for any
two simple drawings of the complete graph $K_n$ with the same crossing edge
pairs, one drawing can be transformed into the other by a sequence of triangle
flips (a.k.a. Reidemeister moves of Type 3). This operation refers to the act
of moving one edge of a triangular cell formed by three pairwise crossing edges
over the opposite crossing of the cell, via a local transformation.
  We investigate to what extent Gioan-type theorems can be obtained for wider
classes of graphs. A necessary (but in general not sufficient) condition for
two drawings of a graph to be transformable into each other by a sequence of
triangle flips is that they have the same ERS. As our main result, we show that
for the large class of complete multipartite graphs, this necessary condition
is in fact also sufficient. We present two different proofs of this result, one
of which is shorter, while the other one yields a polynomial time algorithm for
which the number of needed triangle flips for graphs on $n$ vertices is bounded
by $O(n^{16})$. The latter proof uses a Carath\'eodory-type theorem for simple
drawings of complete multipartite graphs, which we believe to be of independent
interest.
  Moreover, we show that our Gioan-type theorem for complete multipartite
graphs is essentially tight in the sense that having the same ERS does not
remain sufficient when removing or adding very few edges.

  entanglement negativity","11 pages, 1 figure",,,,"hep-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-particle correlations in the proton on the light-front are described by a
mixed density matrix obtained by tracing over all other, unobserved, degrees of
freedom. We quantify genuinely quantum quark azimuthal correlations in terms of
the entanglement negativity measure of Quantum Information Theory. While the
two-quark state in color space is one of high entropy and weak quantum
correlation, we find that a standard three-quark model wave function from the
literature predicts an azimuthally correlated state of low entropy and high
entanglement negativity. Low entropy is consistent with expectations for many
colors (at fixed 't Hooft coupling $g^2 N_c$) but high negativity indicates
substantial two-particle quantum correlations at $N_c=3$. We also describe how
to account for the leading ${\cal O}(g^2)$ correction to the density matrix
from light-cone perturbation theory which is due to the presence (or exchange)
of a gluon in the proton. This correction increases the entropy and reduces the
negativity of the density matrix for quark pair azimuthal correlations. Hence,
the entanglement negativity measure may provide novel insight into the
structure of the proton state of QCD.

alignment across the whole observer-space. We calculate the physical depth of
the optical depth $\tau = 1$ surface and find that for $^{12}$CO it is largely
located in front of the cloud midplane, suggesting that $^{12}$CO is too
optically thick and instead mainly probes low volume density gas. In our
super-Alfv\'enic simulation, the magnetic field becomes significantly more
tangled, and all observed tracers tend toward no preference for perpendicular

thin and optically thick tracers may indicate the presence of a dynamically
important magnetic field, though there is some degeneracy with viewing angle.

longitudinal-vertical atmospheric structure. The night-side spectrum was
well-fit by a cloudy, non-irradiated atmospheric model while the day-side was
best-matched by a cloudy, weakly irradiated model. Additionally, we created a

evidence for efficient day-to-night heat redistribution and a moderately high

$0.6\%$ ($1\%$) of the mergers in NSCs (GCs) reach the coalescence with
eccentricity ${>0.1}$, while in YSCs only $0.08\%$ of the mergers is eccentric.
Approximately $\sim63\%$ of these events are produced by chaotic, resonant
interactions where temporary binaries are continuously formed and destroyed,
while $\sim31\%$ arise from prompt interactions where two black holes (BHs)

essential tool to secure quantum communication. Ensuring high-fidelity
entanglement has always been a challenging task owing to interaction with the
hostile channel environment created due to quantum noise and decoherence.
Though several methods have been proposed, achieving almost 100% error
correction is still a gigantic task. As one of the main contributions of this
work, a new model for large distance communication has been introduced, which
can correct all bit flip errors or other errors quite extensively if proper
encoding is used. To achieve this purpose, at the very first step, the idea of
differentiating the long and short-distance applications has been introduced.
Short-distance is determined by the maximum range of applying unitary control
gates by the qubit technology. As far as we know, there is no previous work
that distinguishes long and short distance applications. At the beginning, we
have applied stabilizer formalism and Repetition Code for decoding to
distinguish the error correcting ability in long and short distance
communication. Particularly for short distance communication, it has been
demonstrated that a properly encoded bell state can identify all the bit flip,
or phase flip errors with 100% accuracy theoretically. In contrast, if the bell
states are used in long distance communication, the error-detecting and
correcting ability reduces at huge amounts. To increase the fidelity
significantly and correct the errors quite extensively for long-distance
communication, a new model based on classical communication protocol has been
proposed. All the required circuits in these processes have been generalized
during encoding. Proposed analytical results have also been verified with the
Simulation results of IBM QISKIT QASM.

colorectal cancer (CRC) and its precursor lesions, i.e., polyps. However, the
procedure experiences high miss rates due to polyp heterogeneity and
inter-observer dependency. Hence, several deep learning powered systems have
been proposed considering the criticality of polyp detection and segmentation
in clinical practices. Despite achieving improved outcomes, the existing
automated approaches are inefficient in attaining real-time processing speed.
Moreover, they suffer from a significant performance drop when evaluated on
inter-patient data, especially those collected from different centers.
Therefore, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep learning based
architecture, Transformer based Residual network (TransNetR), for colon polyp
segmentation and evaluate its diagnostic performance. The proposed
architecture, TransNetR, is an encoder-decoder network that consists of a
pre-trained ResNet50 as the encoder, three decoder blocks, and an upsampling
layer at the end of the network. TransNetR obtains a high dice coefficient of
0.8706 and a mean Intersection over union of 0.8016 and retains a real-time
processing speed of 54.60 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset. Apart from this, the major
contribution of the work lies in exploring the generalizability of the
TransNetR by testing the proposed algorithm on the out-of-distribution (test
distribution is unknown and different from training distribution) dataset. As a
use case, we tested our proposed algorithm on the PolypGen (6 unique centers)
dataset and two other popular polyp segmentation benchmarking datasets. We
obtained state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets during
out-of-distribution testing. The source code of TransNetR will be made publicly

gapped phases of matter from the point of view of infinite spin lattice
systems, using the framework of algebraic quantum mechanics. We define the
notion of quantum state types. These are certain lax-monoidal functors from the
category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces to the category of topological
spaces. The universal example takes a finite dimensional Hilbert space
$\mathcal{H}$ to the pure state space of the quasi-local algebra of the quantum
spin system with Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ at each site of a specified
lattice. The lax-monoidal structure encodes the tensor product of states, which
corresponds to stacking for quantum systems. We then explain how to formally
extract parametrized phases of matter from quantum state types, and how they
naturally give rise to $\mathscr{E}_\infty$-spaces for an operad we call the
multiplicative linear isometry operad. We define the notion of invertible
quantum state types and explain how the passage to phases for these is related
to group completion. We also explain how invertible quantum state types give
rise to loop-spectra. Our motivation is to provide a framework for constructing
Kitaev's loop-spectrum of bosonic invertible gapped phases of matter. Finally,
as a first step towards understanding the homotopy types of the loop-spectra
associated to invertible quantum state types, we prove that the pure state
space of any UHF algebra is simply connected.

therefore, estimating the parameters of aggregation, i.e., mapping of
multi-objective utilities to a scalar value, becomes an essential part of game
construction. However, estimating this parameter from observational data
introduces several challenges due to a host of unobservable factors, including
the underlying modality of aggregation and the possibly boundedly rational

rationalisability, we develop algorithms for estimating multi-objective
aggregation parameters for two common aggregation methods, weighted and

in-plane to the out-of-plane direction in addition to T$_C$. Here, we have
studied the magnetotransport in a multilayer Hall bar device fabricated on 300
nm Si/SiO$_2$ substrate. Interestingly, the zero field resistivity shows a
negligible change in resistivity near T$_C$ unlike the typical metallic FM,
whereas, it exhibits a dramatic fall below T$_{SR}$. Also, the resistivity
shows a weak anomaly at T $ \sim $ 38 K (T$_Q$), below which the resistivity
shows a quadratic temperature dependence according to the Fermi liquid
behavior. Temperature-dependent Hall data exhibits important consequences. The
ordinary Hall coefficient changes sign near T$_{SR}$ indicating the change in
majority carriers. In a similar manner, the magnetoresistance (MR) data shows
significantly large negative MR near T$_{SR}$ and becomes positive below T$_Q$.
The observations of anomaly in the resistivity, sign-change of the ordinary
Hall coefficient and maximum negative MR near T$_{SR}$, together suggest a
possible Fermi surface reconstruction associated with the spin reorientation
transition. Furthermore, analysis of the Hall data reveals a significant
anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) from $\sim 123 \Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ (at T
$\approx$ 5 K) to the maximum value of $\sim 366 \Omega^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ near

primarily appearing due to the side-jump mechanism as a result of the spin-flip

high-performance DRAM-based main memory for future systems, it is critical to
rigorously characterize, analyze, and understand various aspects (e.g.,
reliability, retention, latency, RowHammer vulnerability) of existing DRAM
chips and their architecture. The goal of this dissertation is to 1) develop
techniques and infrastructures to enable such rigorous characterization,
analysis, and understanding, and 2) enable new mechanisms to improve DRAM
performance, reliability, and security based on the developed understanding.
  To this end, in this dissertation, we 1) design, implement, and prototype a
new practical-to-use and flexible FPGA-based DRAM characterization
infrastructure (called SoftMC), 2) use the DRAM characterization infrastructure
to develop a new experimental methodology (called U-TRR) to uncover the
operation of existing proprietary in-DRAM RowHammer protection mechanisms and
craft new RowHammer access patterns to efficiently circumvent these RowHammer
protection mechanisms, 3) propose a new DRAM architecture, called SelfManaging
DRAM, for enabling autonomous and efficient in-DRAM maintenance operations that
enable not only better performance, efficiency, and reliability but also faster
and easier adoption of changes to DRAM chips, and 4) propose a versatile DRAM

Moreover, the occurrence of magnetic breakdown on the edges of the Brillouin

formation of 2D orbit networks. These extended network states compose

observed in transport experiments as a strong enhancement of the longitudinal

attention in federated learning and multi-agent scenarios exploiting
finite-difference approximations of the gradient using from $2$ (directional

significant challenge in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. Our
primary motivation is to introduce a robust and scalable framework that enables
efficient network anomaly detection. We address the issue of scalability and
efficiency for network anomaly detection by leveraging federated learning, in
which multiple participants train a global model jointly. Unlike centralized
training architectures, federated learning does not require participants to
upload their training data to the server, preventing attackers from exploiting
the training data. Moreover, most prior works have focused on traditional
centralized machine learning, making federated machine learning under-explored
in network anomaly detection. Therefore, we propose a deep neural network
framework that could work on low to mid-end devices detecting network anomalies

Compared to multiple traditional centralized machine learning models, the deep

expression of any Boolean function of up to $n$ variables. First we rigorously
prove that a GP system using the complete truth table to evaluate the program

1D equation when expressed in terms of particle phase. Contrary to the
prevalent notion, the pathline for both kinds of \emph{linear waves} is an open
trajectory, and a particle undergoes a net drift in the direction of wave
propagation, which is nothing but Stokes drift. We argue that Stokes drift,
although overwhelmingly studied and physically rationalized in the context of

generalizes some common variants of worst-case and Bayesian principal-agent
problems. With this formulation, we first construct a theoretical framework to
certify whether any surjective contract menu is optimal, and quantify its
sub-optimality. The framework and its proofs rely on a novel construction and
comparison of several related optimization problems. Roughly speaking, our
framework transforms the question of contract menu optimality into the study of
duality gaps. We then operationalize the framework to study the optimality of
simple -- affine and linear -- contract menus. By our framework, the optimality
gap of a contract menu is broken down into an adjustability gap and an
information rent. We show that, with strong geometric intuition, these simple
contract menus tend to be close to optimal when the social value of production
is convex in production cost and the conversion ratio is large at the agent's
highest effort level. We also provide succinct and closed-form expressions to
quantify the optimality gap when the social value function is concave. With
this systematic analysis, our results shed light on the technical root of a
higher-level question -- why are there more positive results in the literature
in terms of a simple menu's optimality in a \emph{robust} (worst-case) setting
rather than in a \emph{stochastic} (Bayesian) setting? Our results demonstrate
that the answer relates to two facts: the sum of quasi-concave functions is not
quasi-concave in general; the maximization operator and the expectation
operator do not commute in general. Overall, our study is among the first to
cross-pollinate the contract theory and optimization literature.

language processing (NLP) tasks due to the attention mechanism, which assigns
an importance score for every word relative to other words in a sequence.
However, these models are very large, often reaching hundreds of billions of
parameters, and therefore require a large number of DRAM accesses. Hence,
traditional deep neural network (DNN) accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs face
limitations in processing Transformers efficiently. In-memory accelerators
based on non-volatile memory promise to be an effective solution to this
challenge, since they provide high storage density while performing massively
parallel matrix vector multiplications within memory arrays. However, attention
score computations, which are frequently used in Transformers (unlike CNNs and
RNNs), require matrix vector multiplications (MVM) where both operands change
dynamically for each input. As a result, conventional NVM-based accelerators
incur high write latency and write energy when used for Transformers, and
further suffer from the low endurance of most NVM technologies. To address
these challenges, we present X-Former, a hybrid in-memory hardware accelerator
that consists of both NVM and CMOS processing elements to execute transformer
workloads efficiently. To improve the hardware utilization of X-Former, we also
propose a sequence blocking dataflow, which overlaps the computations of the

value in thermal equilibrium, is a leading method for enhancing the sensitivity
of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In
this approach, a readily available source of higher spin order, either from
electron spins in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) or singlet states in
hydrogen for PHIP / SABRE, is placed in close contact with the nuclear spin of
interest to allow for efficient transfer of the spin order. However, the
physics of polarization transfer from electron spins and nuclear singlet states
appears to differ substantially due to the marked difference in energy scale
between electron and nuclear spins and due to the different physical origin and
strength of the interaction with the target nuclei. Nevertheless, utilizing a
pseudo-spin formalism we show that a critical regime of PHIP / SABRE, namely
the low-field polarization transfer regime can be mapped to an equivalent
system, where the heteronuclear target spin takes a role analogous to that of
the DNP-electron and the pseudospin of the parahydrogen takes the role of the
nuclear spin in DNP. Using this equivalence we provide a detailed mapping
between some of the most important polarization transfer sequences in PHIP and
DNP and we show how one can transfer sequences that have been developed in one

communication and human computer interface reasons. To improve the capture
performance, we can often find multi-microphone speech enhancement techniques
deployed on various devices. Multi-microphone speech enhancement problem is
often decomposed into two decoupled steps: a beamformer that provides spatial
filtering and a single-channel speech enhancement model that cleans up the
beamformer output. In this work, we propose a speech enhancement solution that
takes both the raw microphone and beamformer outputs as the input for an ML
model. We devise a simple yet effective training scheme that allows the model
to learn from the cues of the beamformer by contrasting the two inputs and
greatly boost its capability in spatial rejection, while conducting the general
tasks of denoising and dereverberation. The proposed solution takes advantage
of classical spatial filtering algorithms instead of competing with them. By
design, the beamformer module then could be selected separately and does not
require a large amount of data to be optimized for a given form factor, and the
network model can be considered as a standalone module which is highly
transferable independently from the microphone array. We name the ML module in
our solution as GSENet, short for Guided Speech Enhancement Network. We
demonstrate its effectiveness on real world data collected on multi-microphone
devices in terms of the suppression of noise and interfering speech.

the size or prevalence of a group of people that is hard to reach through a
standard survey. The basic NSUM involves two steps: estimating respondents'
degrees by one of various methods (in this paper we focus on the probe group
method which uses the number of people a respondent knows in various groups of
known size), and estimating the prevalence of the hard-to-reach population of
interest using respondents' estimated degrees and the number of people they
report knowing in the hard-to-reach group. Each of these two steps involves
taking either an average of ratios or a ratio of averages. Using the ratio of
averages for each step has so far been the most common approach. However, we
present theoretical arguments that using the average of ratios at the second,
prevalence-estimation step often has lower mean squared error when a main model
assumption is violated, which happens frequently in practice; this estimator
which uses the ratio of averages for degree estimates and the average of ratios
for prevalence was proposed early in NSUM development but has largely been
unexplored and unused. Simulation results using an example network data set
also support these findings. Based on this theoretical and empirical evidence,
we suggest that future surveys that use a simple estimator may want to use this
mixed estimator, and estimation methods based on this estimator may produce new
improvements.

cavities have reached the quality factors $Q\sim 10^{11}$ at 1-2 GHz and 1.5 K

the materials nano structuring and impurity management. These issues are also
relevant to many applications using high-Q thin film resonators, including
single-photon detectors and quantum circuits. This topical review outlines
basic physical mechanisms of the rf nonlinear surface impedance controlled by
quasiparticles, dielectric losses and trapped vortices, as well as the dynamic

A section focuses on mechanisms of residual surface resistance which dominates
rf losses at ultra low temperatures. Microwave losses of trapped vortices and
their reduction by optimizing the concentration of impurities and pinning

pressure and conductive walls in the chamber leads to facility effects that
increase uncertainty in the performance of the thruster in space. To address
this issue, this study utilizes a fully kinetic simulation to investigate the
facility effects on the thruster plume. The in-chamber condition shows a
downstream neutral particle density 100 times larger than the in-space case due
to ion neutralization at the wall and limited vacuum pump capability, resulting
in a significant difference in the density and distribution of charge-exchange
ions. The flux, energy, and angle of charge-exchange ions incident on the
chamber wall are found to be altered by the electron sheath, which can only be
simulated by the fully kinetic approach, as opposed to the conventionally used
quasi-neutral Boltzmann approach. We also examine the effect of backsputtering,
another important facility effect, and find that it does not necessarily
require a fully kinetic simulation as the incident flux and energy of the
sampled charge-exchange ion are negligibly small. Finally, we demonstrate that
the carbon deposition rate on the thruster is significantly influenced by the
angular dependence of the sputtered carbon, with a nearly 50% effect.

the complex interactions and individual heterogeneity of gut microbiota, which
are two common and important issues in genetics and intestinal microbiology,

Binary matrix based on Logistic Regression (LRBmat) is proposed to deal with
the above problem. The binary matrix can directly weakened or avoided the
influence of heterogeneity, and also contain the information about gut
microbial interactions with any order. Moreover, LRBmat has a powerful
generalization, it can combine with any machine learning method and enhance
them. The real data analysis on CRC validates the proposed method, which has
the best classification performance compared with the state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, the association rules extracted from the binary matrix of the real
data align well with the biological properties and existing literatures, which
are helpful for the etiological analysis of CRC. The source codes for LRBmat

e.g., loss of plasticity, implicit under-parameterization, primacy bias, and
capacity loss. We investigate this phenomenon closely at scale and analyze how
the weights, gradients, and activations change over time in several experiments
with varying dimensions (e.g., similarity between games, number of games,
number of frames per game), with some experiments spanning 50 days and 2
billion environment interactions. Our analysis shows that the activation

the instantaneous flare rate is a function of the stress in the system, and a
flare becomes certain as the stress approaches a threshold set by the
micro-physics of the flare trigger. If the system is driven fast, and if the
threshold is static and uniform globally, a cross-correlation is predicted
between the size of a flare and the forward waiting time to the next flare.
This cross-correlation is broadly absent from the \emph{Geostationary

One also predicts higher cross-correlations in active regions where the shapes
of the waiting time and size distributions match. Again there is no evidence

model does not give the expected result. Thus, it has a high chance of showing
poor results. This paper proposes a novel way of generating diverse handwritten
word images using handwritten characters. The idea of our project is to train
the BiLSTM-CTC architecture with generated synthetic handwritten words. The
whole approach shows the process of generating two types of large and diverse

words also have issues like overlapping between two characters, we have tried
to put it into our experimental part. We have also demonstrated the process of
recognizing handwritten documents using the deep learning model. For the
experiments, we have targeted the Bangla language, which lacks the handwritten
word dataset, and can be followed for any language. Our approach is less
complex and less costly than traditional GAN models. Finally, we have evaluated
our model using Word Error Rate (WER), accuracy, f1-score, precision, and
recall metrics. The model gives 39% WER score, 92% percent accuracy, and 92%

when coupling into single-mode fibers. Traditional adaptive optics (AO) systems
use a wavefront sensor to improve fiber coupling. This leads to higher system

introduces latency, making OSGC for internet service impractical. We propose
the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to reduce the latency, size and cost of

in the fact that often multiple sequences are acquired on different planes.
However, in practice, these sequences are not orthogonal to each other,
limiting the applicability of many previous solutions to reconstruct
higher-resolution images from multiple lower-resolution ones. We propose a
weakly-supervised deep learning-based solution to generating high-resolution

unsupervised registration networks by introducing two new regularizations to
make registration and segmentation reinforce each other. Finally, we introduce
a multi-view fusion method to generate high-resolution target object masks. The

the presence of vulnerabilities in software source code. These flaws are highly
likely ex-ploited and lead to system compromise, data leakage, or denial of
ser-vice. C and C++ open source code are now available in order to create a
large-scale, classical machine-learning and quantum machine-learning system for
function-level vulnerability identification. We assembled a siz-able dataset of
millions of open-source functions that point to poten-tial exploits. We created
an efficient and scalable vulnerability detection method based on a deep neural
network model Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and quantum machine learning model
Long Short Term Memory (QLSTM), that can learn features extracted from the
source codes. The source code is first converted into a minimal intermediate
representation to remove the pointless components and shorten the de-pendency.
Therefore, We keep the semantic and syntactic information using state of the
art word embedding algorithms such as Glove and fastText. The embedded vectors
are subsequently fed into the classical and quantum convolutional neural
networks to classify the possible vulnerabilities. To measure the performance,
we used evaluation metrics such as F1 score, precision, re-call, accuracy, and
total execution time. We made a comparison between the results derived from the
classical LSTM and quantum LSTM using basic feature representation as well as
semantic and syntactic represen-tation. We found that the QLSTM with semantic
and syntactic features detects significantly accurate vulnerability and runs
faster than its classical counterpart.

the sensor readings can be very noisy. Denoising such a dataset is a
prerequisite for any useful application and security issues. Security is a

multi-port reflectometers are increasingly used as low-overhead impedance
monitors. In this work, using periodic structures as multi-ports is proposed.
Periodic structures impose a new constraint on the multi-port theory and
simplify it significantly. This simplification leads to closed form solution
for calibration and measurement procedures. The closed-form solution also shows
that any arbitrary periodic structure will always have a unique solution for
both procedures. Therefore, the proposed technique does not rely on
frequency-dependent behavior of devices, such as directivity and phase shift to
measure impedance. This fact leads to increased bandwidth and simplified design
procedure. In addition, proposed multi-port structures can be calibrated by
using fewer known loads than existing multi-port techniques. This fact, coupled
with the closed-form solution, reduces computation overhead and test time. The
theory and its robustness against non-idealities, such as part-to-part
variation, are verified with Monte-Carlo simulations. A practical embodiment of
the technique is demonstrated with EM simulations and hardware experiments. In
this embodiment, the multi-port structure is embedded into an LC matching

selectively pass through important sounds; however, implementing these models
for a user-centric experience presents several unique challenges. First, most
people spend limited time customizing their headphones, so the sound detection
should work reasonably well out of the box. Second, the models should be able
to learn over time the specific sounds that are important to users based on
their implicit and explicit interactions. Finally, such models should have a
small memory footprint to run on low-power headphones with limited on-chip

there could be significant benefits to the integration of these methods in

synthetic models. Early detection of road debris is critical for safe
autonomous or assisted driving, yet the development of a robust road debris
detection model has not been widely discussed. There are two main challenges to
building a road debris detector: first, data collection of road debris is
challenging since hazardous objects on the road are rare to encounter in real
driving scenarios; second, the variability of road debris is broad, ranging
from a very small brick to a large fallen tree. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel approach to few-shot learning of road debris that uses
semantic augmentation and domain randomization to augment real road images with
synthetic models. We constrain the problem domain to uncommon objects on the
road and allow the deep neural network, HazardNet, to learn the semantic
meaning of road debris to eventually detect unseen road debris. Our results
demonstrate that HazardNet is able to accurately detect real road debris when
only trained on synthetic objects in augmented images.

suppression of their cold interstellar medium (ISM) by environmental
mechanisms. While the removal of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) at large radii is
well studied, how the environment impacts the remaining gas in the centres of
galaxies, which are dominated by molecular gas, is less clear. Using new
observations from the Virgo Environment traced in CO survey (VERTICO) and
archival HI data, we study the HI and molecular gas within the optical discs of
Virgo cluster galaxies on 1.2-kpc scales with spatially resolved scaling
relations between stellar (${\Sigma}_{\star}$), HI (${\Sigma}_\mathrm{HI}$),
and molecular gas (${\Sigma}_\mathrm{mol}$) surface densities. Adopting HI
deficiency as a measure of environmental impact, we find evidence that, in
addition to removing the HI at large radii, the cluster processes also lower
the average ${\Sigma}_\mathrm{HI}$ of the remaining gas even in the central 1.2
kpc. The impact on molecular gas is comparatively weaker than on the HI, and we
show that the lower ${\Sigma}_\mathrm{mol}$ gas is removed first. In the most
HI-deficient galaxies, however, we find evidence that environmental processes
reduce the typical ${\Sigma}_\mathrm{mol}$ of the remaining gas by nearly a
factor of 3. We find no evidence for environment-driven elevation of
${\Sigma}_\mathrm{HI}$ or ${\Sigma}_\mathrm{mol}$ in HI-deficient galaxies.
Using the ratio of ${\Sigma}_\mathrm{mol}$-to-${\Sigma}_\mathrm{HI}$ in
individual regions, we show that changes in the ISM physical conditions,
estimated using the total gas surface density and midplane hydrostatic
pressure, cannot explain the observed reduction in molecular gas content.
Instead, we suggest that direct stripping of the molecular gas is required to
explain our results.

electric power systems. They can quickly spread and cause severe damage to
power infrastructure. To reduce the risk, public safety power shutoffs are
often used to restore power balance and prevent widespread blackouts. However,
the unpredictability of wildfires makes it challenging to implement effective
counter-measures in a timely manner. This paper proposes an optimization-based
topology control problem as a solution to mitigate the impact of wildfires. The
goal is to find the optimal network topology that minimizes total operating
costs and prevents load shedding during power shutoffs under uncertain line
shutoff scenarios caused by uncertain spreading wildfires. The solution
involves solving two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programs, with
preventive and corrective control actions taken when the risk of a wildfire and
corresponding outage line scenarios are known with low and high confidence,
respectively. The Progressive Hedging algorithm is used to solve both problems.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using data from the
RTS-GMLC system that is artificially geo-located in Southern California,
including actual wildfire incidents and risk maps. Our work provides a crucial
study of the comparative benefits due to accurate risk forecast and
corresponding preventive control over real-time corrective control that may not

overcome this challenge, we give a general protocol for achieving a quantum

classical double lock-in amplifier, our protocol is accomplished via two
quantum mixers under orthogonal pulse sequences. The two orthogonal pulse
sequences act the roles of two orthogonal reference signals in a classical

discover that depth is a key ingredient to influence the optical flow: the
deeper depth, the inferior optical flow, which motivates us to design a
depth-association motion adaptation module to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain
gap. Moreover, we figure out that the cost volume correlation shares similar

devise a correlation-alignment motion adaptation module to distill motion
knowledge of the synthetic foggy domain to the real foggy domain. Note that
synthetic fog is designed as the intermediate domain. Under this unified
framework, the proposed cumulative adaptation progressively transfers knowledge
from clean scenes to real foggy scenes. Extensive experiments have been

captured from a single microphone that contains multiple people talking at
once, environmental noise, and reverberation into multiple de-reverberated and
noise-free speech tracks, each track containing only one talker. While large
state-of-the-art DNNs can achieve excellent separation from anechoic mixtures
of speech, the main challenge is to create compact and causal models that can
separate reverberant mixtures at inference time. In this paper, we explore
low-complexity, resource-efficient, causal DNN architectures for real-time
separation of two or more simultaneous speakers. A cascade of three neural
network modules are trained to sequentially perform noise-suppression,
separation, and de-reverberation. For comparison, a larger end-to-end model is
trained to output two anechoic speech signals directly from noisy reverberant
speech mixtures. We propose an efficient single-decoder architecture with
subtractive separation for real-time recursive speech separation for two or
more speakers. Evaluation on real monophonic recordings of speech mixtures,
according to speech separation measures like SI-SDR, perceptual measures like
DNS-MOS, and a novel proposed channel separation metric, show that these
compact causal models can separate speech mixtures with low latency, and
perform on par with large offline state-of-the-art models like SepFormer.

non-stationarity, where a firm sells products to $T$ sequentially arriving
consumers that behave according to an unknown demand model with potential
changes at unknown times. The demand model is assumed to be a high-dimensional
generalized linear model (GLM), allowing for a feature vector in $\mathbb R^d$
that encodes products and consumer information. To achieve optimal revenue
(i.e., least regret), the firm needs to learn and exploit the unknown GLMs
while monitoring for potential change-points. To tackle such a problem, we
first design a novel penalized likelihood-based online change-point detection
algorithm for high-dimensional GLMs, which is the first algorithm in the
change-point literature that achieves optimal minimax localization error rate
for high-dimensional GLMs. A change-point detection assisted dynamic pricing
(CPDP) policy is further proposed and achieves a near-optimal regret of order
$O(s\sqrt{\Upsilon_T T}\log(Td))$, where $s$ is the sparsity level and
$\Upsilon_T$ is the number of change-points. This regret is accompanied with a
minimax lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of CPDP (up to logarithmic
factors). In particular, the optimality with respect to $\Upsilon_T$ is seen
for the first time in the dynamic pricing literature, and is achieved via a
novel accelerated exploration mechanism. Extensive simulation experiments and a
real data application on online lending illustrate the efficiency of the
proposed policy and the importance and practical value of handling
non-stationarity in dynamic pricing.

interdomain routing in software-defined networking (SDN) have long adaptation
times and slow convergence speeds, coupled with the shortcomings of traditional
interdomain routing methods, such as cumbersome configuration and inflexible
acquisition of network state information. These drawbacks make it difficult to
obtain a global state information of the network, and the optimal routing
decision cannot be made in real time, affecting network performance. This paper
proposes a cross-domain intelligent SDN routing method based on a proposed
multiagent deep reinforcement learning. First, the network is divided into
multiple subdomains managed by multiple local controllers, and the state
information of each subdomain is flexibly obtained by the designed SDN
multithreaded network measurement mechanism. Then, a cooperative communication
module is designed to realize message transmission and message synchronization
between root and local controllers, and socket technology is used to ensure the
reliability and stability of message transmission between multiple controllers
to realize the real-time acquisition of global network state information.
Finally, after the optimal intradomain and interdomain routing paths are
adaptively generated by the agents in the root and local controllers, a
prediction mechanism for the network traffic state is designed to improve the
awareness of the cross-domain intelligent routing method and enable the
generation of the optimal routing paths in the global network in real time.
Experimental results show that the proposed cross-domain intelligent routing
method can significantly improve the network throughput, reduce the network
delay and the packet loss rate compared to the Dijkstra and OSPF routing
methods.

instances are annotated. This is actually impractical due to the high labor and
time costs and the unavoidable missing annotations. As a result, the incomplete
annotation in each image could provide misleading supervision and harm the
training. Recent works on sparsely annotated object detection alleviate this
problem by generating pseudo labels for the missing annotations. Such a
mechanism is sensitive to the threshold of the pseudo label score. However, the
effective threshold is different in different training stages and among
different object detectors. Therefore, the current methods with fixed
thresholds have sub-optimal performance, and are difficult to be applied to
other detectors. In order to resolve this obstacle, we propose a Calibrated
Teacher, of which the confidence estimation of the prediction is well
calibrated to match its real precision. In this way, different detectors in
different training stages would share a similar distribution of the output
confidence, so that multiple detectors could share the same fixed threshold and
achieve better performance. Furthermore, we present a simple but effective
Focal IoU Weight (FIoU) for the classification loss. FIoU aims at reducing the
loss weight of false negative samples caused by the missing annotation, and
thus works as the complement of the teacher-student paradigm. Extensive
experiments show that our methods set new state-of-the-art under all different

challenge in natural language processing. Transformers models have recently
addressed this issue by incorporating an attention mechanism that assigns
greater attention (i.e., relevance) scores to some words than others. Because
of the attention mechanism's high computational cost, transformer models
usually have an input-length limitation caused by hardware constraints. This
limitation applies to many transformers, including the well-known bidirectional

examined BERT's attention assignment mechanism, focusing on two questions: (1)
How can attention be employed to reduce input length? (2) How can attention be

these questions in the context of a text classification task. We discovered
that BERT's early layers assign more critical attention scores for text

layer's attention sums could be used to filter tokens in a given sequence,
considerably decreasing the input length while maintaining good test accuracy.
We also applied filtering, which uses a compute-efficient semantic similarities
algorithm, and discovered that retaining approximately 6\% of the original

could generate data in a stable manner and indistinguishable from the original
one by only using a small percentage (10\%) of the tokens with high attention
scores according to BERT's first layer.

noise-dominated PDS and type-B quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), and their

QPOs, we find that the spectral ratios above 10 keV are nearly constant or
slightly decreasing, and the values are different between sources. Below 10
keV, the flux change of the Comptonization component is inversely proportional
to the flux change of the thermal component, suggesting that the appearance of
type-B QPOs is associated with a redistribution of the accretion power between
the disc and the Comptonizing emission region. The spectral ratios between the
periods with type-B QPO and those with broadband noise are significantly
different from that with type-B QPO and without type-B QPO, where the ratios
(type-B QPO/broadband noise) show a maximum at around 4 keV and then decrease
gradually towards high energies. Finally, we discuss the possible change of the
geometry of the inner accretion flow and/or jet during the transitions.

the performance of networks on structured datasets. STWD-SFNN adopts
multi-granularity levels to dynamically learn the number of hidden layer nodes

at the coarse granular level, STWD-SFNN handles easy-to-classify instances by
applying strict threshold conditions, and with the increasing number of hidden
layer nodes at the fine granular level, STWD-SFNN focuses more on disposing of
the difficult-to-classify instances by applying loose threshold conditions,
thereby realizing the classification of instances. Moreover, STWD-SFNN
considers and reports the process cost produced from each granular level. The
experimental results verify that STWD-SFNN has a more compact network on

''super-competitive accretion'', a term that describes a situation where only
the central few objects grow supermassive while a larger number of stars
compete for the reservoir, with significant accretion flows of $\gtrsim0.1$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. This scenario particularly implies that the presence of
fragmentation will not necessarily impeed the formation of a central massive
object. We here explore this phenomenon using analytical estimates for growth
via collisions and accretion, considering accretion due to self-gravity as well
as Bondi-Hoyle accretion. Particularly, we explore under what conditions the
accretion onto the central massive object breaks down, and derive a criterion
that depends on the mass of the most massive object and the mass in fragments.
For compact clusters with sizes about $0.1$~pc, we further find that the mass
growth by collisions is comparable to the growth via accretion. Our results are
validated through the comparison with numerical simulations, and we overall
conclude that super-competitive accretion is a valid mechanism for the
formation of very massive objects in the early Universe.

that attackers can invoke existing methods (gadgets) on the application's

techniques have been proposed to statically identify suspicious gadget chains
and dynamically generate injection objects for fuzzing. However, due to their
incomplete support for dynamic program features (e.g., Java runtime
polymorphism) and ineffective injection object generation for fuzzing, the
existing techniques are still far from satisfactory.
  In this paper, we first performed an empirical study to investigate the
characteristics of Java deserialization vulnerabilities based on our manually
collected 86 publicly known gadget chains. The empirical results show that 1)
Java deserialization gadgets are usually exploited by abusing runtime
polymorphism, which enables attackers to reuse serializable overridden methods;
and 2) attackers usually invoke exploitable overridden methods (gadgets) via
dynamic binding to generate injection objects for gadget chain construction.
Based on our empirical findings, we propose a novel gadget chain mining
approach, \emph{GCMiner}, which captures both explicit and implicit method
calls to identify more gadget chains, and adopts an overriding-guided object
generation approach to generate valid injection objects for fuzzing. The
evaluation results show that \emph{GCMiner} significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, and discovers 56 unique gadget chains that cannot

  Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2023)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regularized discrete optimal transport (OT) is a powerful tool to measure the
distance between two discrete distributions that have been constructed from
data samples on two different domains. While it has a wide range of
applications in machine learning, in some cases the sampled data from only one
of the domains will have class labels such as unsupervised domain adaptation.
In this kind of problem setting, a group-sparse regularizer is frequently
leveraged as a regularization term to handle class labels. In particular, it
can preserve the label structure on the data samples by corresponding the data
samples with the same class label to one group-sparse regularization term. As a
result, we can measure the distance while utilizing label information by
solving the regularized optimization problem with gradient-based algorithms.
However, the gradient computation is expensive when the number of classes or
data samples is large because the number of regularization terms and their
respective sizes also turn out to be large. This paper proposes fast discrete
OT with group-sparse regularizers. Our method is based on two ideas. The first
is to safely skip the computations of the gradients that must be zero. The
second is to efficiently extract the gradients that are expected to be nonzero.
Our method is guaranteed to return the same value of the objective function as
that of the original method. Experiments show that our method is up to 8.6
times faster than the original method without degrading accuracy.

aligned with pretraining of language transformers by predicting masked patches
as a pretext task. A criterion in unsupervised pretraining is the pretext task
needs to be sufficiently hard to prevent the transformer encoder from learning
trivial low-level features not generalizable well to downstream tasks. For this
purpose, we propose an Adversarial Positional Embedding (AdPE) approach -- It
distorts the local visual structures by perturbing the position encodings so
that the learned transformer cannot simply use the locally correlated patches
to predict the missing ones. We hypothesize that it forces the transformer
encoder to learn more discriminative features in a global context with stronger
generalizability to downstream tasks. We will consider both absolute and
relative positional encodings, where adversarial positions can be imposed both
in the embedding mode and the coordinate mode. We will also present a new MAE+
baseline that brings the performance of the MIM pretraining to a new level with
the AdPE. The experiments demonstrate that our approach can improve the
fine-tuning accuracy of MAE by $0.8\%$ and $0.4\%$ over 1600 epochs of
pretraining ViT-B and ViT-L on Imagenet1K. For the transfer learning task, it
outperforms the MAE with the ViT-B backbone by $2.6\%$ in mIoU on ADE20K, and
by $3.2\%$ in AP$^{bbox}$ and $1.6\%$ in AP$^{mask}$ on COCO, respectively.

21-cm line signals, and in particular, Experiment to Detect the Global EoR
Signature (EDGES) recently has reported the first detection of an absorption
signal, which corresponds to the 21-cm line global signal at the epoch of
reionization (EoR). The future large radio telescope, Square Kilometre Array
(SKA) will be able to deliver the high-precision measurement of 21-cm line
emission/absorption signals. In this paper, we review the current status for
the 21-cm line global and fluctuation signals from EoR to the dark ages, and
then summarize the recent studies of how we probe the primordial Universe
particularly motivated by the recent EDGES result and future observations by
SKA. We focus on two applications for constraining cosmology with the EDGES
result: constraints on the primordial magnetic fields and those on the
primordial power spectrum. We also discuss the potential of future SKA for
probing the inflationary Universe, by discussing expected constraints on the
primordial power spectrum, its adiabaticity, and primordial non-Gaussianities
from future observations of 21-cm fluctuations.

crucial for various applications, such as autonomous driving and robotics.
However, existing approaches have primarily relied on appearance matching or
motion modeling within only two successive frames, thereby overlooking the
long-range continuous motion property of objects in 3D space. To address this
issue, this paper presents a novel approach that views each tracklet as a
continuous stream: at each timestamp, only the current frame is fed into the
network to interact with multi-frame historical features stored in a memory
bank, enabling efficient exploitation of sequential information. To achieve
effective cross-frame message passing, a hybrid attention mechanism is designed
to account for both long-range relation modeling and local geometric feature
extraction. Furthermore, to enhance the utilization of multi-frame features for
robust tracking, a contrastive sequence enhancement strategy is designed, which
uses ground truth tracklets to augment training sequences and promote
discrimination against false positives in a contrastive manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art method by significant margins (approximately 8%, 6%, and 12%
improvements in the success performance on KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo,
respectively).

CoMeta to enhance the meta embeddings with the collaborative information.
CoMeta consists of two submodules: B-EG and S-EG. Specifically, for a new item:
B-EG calculates the similarity-based weighted sum of the ID embeddings of old
items as its base embedding; S-EG generates its shift embedding not only with
its attribute features but also with the average ID embedding of the users who
interacted with it. The final meta embedding is obtained by adding up the base

been proposed as alternatives to weighted CE for training large models on
label-imbalanced data far beyond the zero train error regime. The driving force
behind those designs has been the theory of implicit bias, which for
linear(ized) models, explains why they successfully induce bias on the
optimization path towards solutions that favor minorities. Aiming to extend
this theory to non-linear models, we investigate the implicit geometry of
classifiers and embeddings that are learned by different CE parameterizations.
Our main result characterizes the global minimizers of a non-convex
cost-sensitive SVM classifier for the unconstrained features model, which
serves as an abstraction of deep nets. We derive closed-form formulas for the
angles and norms of classifiers and embeddings as a function of the number of
classes, the imbalance and the minority ratios, and the loss hyperparameters.
Using these, we show that logit-adjusted parameterizations can be appropriately
tuned to learn symmetric geometries irrespective of the imbalance ratio. We
complement our analysis with experiments and an empirical study of convergence
accuracy in deep-nets.

can be trained with limited medical data, making it a valuable tool in medical

region-phrase correspondences, we further propose Tri-attention Context
contrastive alignment (TaCo). TaCo seeks context alignment to pull both the
features and attention outputs of relevant region-phrase pairs close together
while pushing those of irrelevant regions far away. This ensures that the final
box prediction depends more on its finding-specific regions and phrases.
Experimental results on three MPG datasets demonstrate that our MedRPG
outperforms state-of-the-art visual grounding approaches by a large margin.
Additionally, the proposed TaCo strategy is effective in enhancing finding

  Tracking","Tech. Report",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planar object tracking is a critical computer vision problem and has drawn
increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics, augmented reality, etc.
Despite rapid progress, its further development, especially in the deep
learning era, is largely hindered due to the lack of large-scale challenging
benchmarks. Addressing this, we introduce PlanarTrack, a large-scale
challenging planar tracking benchmark. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of
1,000 videos with more than 490K images. All these videos are collected in
complex unconstrained scenarios from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack,
compared with existing benchmarks, more challenging but realistic for
real-world applications. To ensure the high-quality annotation, each frame in
PlanarTrack is manually labeled using four corners with multiple-round careful
inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack, to date, is the
largest and most challenging dataset dedicated to planar object tracking. In
order to analyze the proposed PlanarTrack, we evaluate 10 planar trackers and
conduct comprehensive comparisons and in-depth analysis. Our results, not
surprisingly, demonstrate that current top-performing planar trackers
degenerate significantly on the challenging PlanarTrack and more efforts are
needed to improve planar tracking in the future. In addition, we further derive
a variant named PlanarTrack$_{\mathbf{BB}}$ for generic object tracking from
PlanarTrack. Our evaluation of 10 excellent generic trackers on
PlanarTrack$_{\mathrm{BB}}$ manifests that, surprisingly,
PlanarTrack$_{\mathrm{BB}}$ is even more challenging than several popular
generic tracking benchmarks and more attention should be paid to handle such
planar objects, though they are rigid. All benchmarks and evaluations will be
released at the project webpage.

classification because of their global receptive field and ability to handle
long-term dependency. However, the existing frameworks which are mainly
extended from the Vision Transformers are not perfectly compatible with audio
signals. In this paper, we introduce a Causal Audio Transformer (CAT)
consisting of a Multi-Resolution Multi-Feature (MRMF) feature extraction with
an acoustic attention block for more optimized audio modeling. In addition, we
propose a causal module that alleviates over-fitting, helps with knowledge
transfer, and improves interpretability. CAT obtains higher or comparable
state-of-the-art classification performance on ESC50, AudioSet and UrbanSound8K
datasets, and can be easily generalized to other Transformer-based models.

bandit framework where each arm has a tiny probability of realizing large
rewards while with overwhelming probability the reward is zero. A key
application of this framework is in online advertising where click rates of
advertisements could be a fraction of a single percent and final conversion to
sales, while highly profitable, may again be a small fraction of the click
rates. Lately, algorithms for BAI problems have been developed that minimise
sample complexity while providing statistical guarantees on the correct arm
selection. As we observe, these algorithms can be computationally prohibitive.
We exploit the fact that the reward process for each arm is well approximated
by a Compound Poisson process to arrive at algorithms that are faster, with a
small increase in sample complexity. We analyze the problem in an asymptotic
regime as rarity of reward occurrence reduces to zero, and reward amounts
increase to infinity. This helps illustrate the benefits of the proposed
algorithm. It also sheds light on the underlying structure of the optimal BAI
algorithms in the rare event setting.

Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) camera on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT).
The Horsehead Nebula contains two sub-millimeter sources, a photodissociation
region (PDR; SMM1) and a starless core (SMM2). We see well-ordered magnetic
fields in both sources. We estimated plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths of
56$\pm$9 and 129$\pm$21 $\mu$G in SMM1 and SMM2, respectively, and obtained
mass-to-flux ratios and Alfv\'en Mach numbers of less than 0.6, suggesting that
the magnetic field can resist gravitational collapse and that magnetic pressure
exceeds internal turbulent pressure in these sources. In SMM2, the kinetic and
gravitational energies are comparable to one another, but less than the
magnetic energy. We suggest a schematic view of the overall magnetic field
structure in the Horsehead Nebula. Magnetic field lines in SMM1 appear have
been compressed and reordered during the formation of the PDR, while the likely
more-embedded SMM2 may have inherited its field from that of the pre-shock
molecular cloud. The magnetic fields appear to currently play an important role
in supporting both sources.

select skilled funds in financial market. However, static factor models are
arguably too stringent as it ignores the serial correlation, which severely
distorts error rate control in large-scale inference. In this manuscript, we
propose a new multiple testing procedure under dynamic factor models that is
robust against both heavy-tailed distributions and the serial dependence. The
idea is to integrate a new sample-splitting strategy based on chronological
order and a two-pass Fama-Macbeth regression to form a series of statistics
with marginal symmetry properties and then to utilize the symmetry properties
to obtain a data-driven threshold. We show that our procedure is able to
control the false discovery rate (FDR) asymptotically under high-dimensional
dynamic factor models. As a byproduct that is of independent interest, we
establish a new exponential-type deviation inequality for the sum of random
variables on a variety of functionals of linear and non-linear processes.
Numerical results including a case study on hedge fund selection demonstrate
the advantage of the proposed method over several state-of-the-art methods.

is one of fundamental issues in complex systems and network science. Urban
traffic flows are related to various problems in cities and can be represented
as a network of local traffic flows. To identify an empirical relation between
the function and network structure of urban traffic flows, we construct a
time-varying traffic flow network of a megacity, Seoul, and analyze its global
efficiency with a percolation-based approach. Comparing the real-world traffic
flow network with its corresponding null-model network having a randomized
structure, we show that the real-world network is less efficient than its
null-model network during rush hour, yet more efficient during non-rush hour.
We observe that in the real-world network, links with the highest betweenness
tend to have lower quality during rush hour compared to links with lower
betweenness, but higher quality during non-rush hour. Since the top betweenness
links tend to traverse the entire network, their congestion has a stronger
impact on the network's global efficiency. Our results suggest that urban
traffic congestion might arise when such backbone links are severely congested

resulting paradoxes must be resolved. It has been suggested that parallel

far, a concrete mechanism by which parallel timelines can be created has never
been satisfactorily formulated. In this paper we propose such a mechanism
within the framework of unmodified quantum mechanics, also known as the Everett

the ""worlds"" of the Everett interpretation; they are created by quantum
entanglement between the time machine and the environment. Therefore, we call
them ""entangled timelines"" or E-CTCs. As the entanglement gradually spreads out
to additional systems, the timelines spread out as well, providing a local and
well-defined alternative to the naive ""branching timelines"" picture often
presented in the literature. Our model differs from Deutsch's familiar D-CTC
model and improves upon it in several important ways.

applications. For reliable usage of MOFs/COFs in functional nanodevice and
practical application, it is quite imperative to investigate their mechanical
properties. Thus, herein a particular attention is paid to study elastic
deformation of few 2D MOFs and COFs having non trivial topological band
dispersion in the regime with linear dependency of stress upon strain.
Specially, we consider different types of deformation and find all the
components of elastic tensor from the stress-strain and energy-strain curves.
These findings may provide useful information to fabricate the MOFs/COFs based
devices by lowering the number of experiments.

disk, triggering a series of attractive CO-related multi-messenger events
around a supermassive black hole. To better understand the nature of an
embedded CO and its surroundings and to investigate CO-related events more
accurately, in this paper, we study the specific accretion process of a CO in
an AGN disk and explore the role of outflow feedback. We show that the
asymptotically isotropic outflow generated from the CO hyper-Eddington
accretion would truncate the circum-CO disk and push out its surrounding gas,
resulting in recurrent formation and refilling of an outflow cavity to
intermittently stop the accretion. Applying this universal cyclic process to
black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs), we find that, even if it is above
the Eddington rate, the mass rate accreted onto a BH is dramatically reduced
compared with the initial gas captured rate and thus consumes few mass of the
AGN disk; outflow feedback on a NS is generally similar, but possesses
complexities on the existence of a stellar magnetic field and hard surface. We
demonstrate that although outflow feedback itself may be unobservable, it
remarkably alters the CO evolution via reducing its mass growth rate, and the
AGN disk can survive from the otherwise drastic CO accretion overlooking
outflow. In addition, we discuss the potential influence of underdense cavity
on CO-related events, which embodies the significant role of outflow feedback
as well.

framework for general sound classification tasks. It first generates
high-quality and feature-rich Mel-spectrograms through a feature-invariant
contrastive loss. Then, the hidden states before and after the statistics
pooling layer are reused when knowledge distillation is performed on these
feature-rich samples. Experimental results on the Urbansound8k, ESC-50, and

Meanwhile, the accuracy of the student model is further improved by reusing the

the disks correspond to the vertices of the graph and a pair of vertices are
adjacent if and only if their corresponding disks intersect. The problem of
determining the time complexity of computing a maximum clique in a disk graph
is a long-standing open question. The problem is known to be open even when the
radii of all the disks are in the interval $[1,(1+\varepsilon)]$, where
$\varepsilon>0$. However, the maximum clique problem is known to be APX-hard
for the intersection graphs of many other convex objects such as intersection
graphs of ellipses, triangles, and a combination of unit disks and
axis-parallel rectangles. Furthermore, there exists an $O(n^3\log n)$-time
algorithm to compute a maximum clique for unit disks. Here we obtain the
following results.
  - We give an algorithm to compute a maximum clique in a unit disk graph in
$O(n^{2.5}\log n)$-time, which improves the previously best known running time
of $O(n^3\log n)$ [Eppstein '09].
  - We extend a widely used `co-2-subdivision approach' to prove that computing
a maximum clique in a combination of unit disks and axis-parallel rectangles is
NP-hard to approximate within $4448/4449 \approx 0.9997 $. The use of a
`co-2-subdivision approach' was previously thought to be unlikely in this
setting [Bonnet et al. '20]. Our result improves the previously known
inapproximability factor of $7633010347/7633010348\approx 0.9999$.
  - We show that the parameter minimum lens width of the disk arrangement may
be used to make progress in the case when disk radii are in
$[1,(1+\varepsilon)]$. For example, if the minimum lens width is at least
$0.265$ and $ \varepsilon\le 0.0001$, which still allows for non-Helly triples
in the arrangement, then one can find a maximum clique in polynomial time.

that curating large-scale labeled facial images is challenging due to the

we propose a self-supervised simple facial landmark encoding (SimFLE) method
that can learn effective encoding of facial landmarks, which are important
features for improving the performance of FER-W, without expensive labels.
Specifically, we introduce novel FaceMAE module for this purpose. FaceMAE
reconstructs masked facial images with elaborately designed semantic masking.
Unlike previous random masking, semantic masking is conducted based on channel
information processed in the backbone, so rich semantics of channels can be
explored. Additionally, the semantic masking process is fully trainable,
enabling FaceMAE to guide the backbone to learn spatial details and contextual
properties of fine-grained facial landmarks. Experimental results on several
FER-W benchmarks prove that the proposed SimFLE is superior in facial landmark
localization and noticeably improved performance compared to the supervised
baseline and other self-supervised methods.

we conduct symbolic execution of opcode and extract the control flow for

also holds when jointly training on images from two different (real or

Consequently, prediction accuracy with convolutional neural network (CNN)
models has been approaching the empirical upper bound estimated based on human
consistency. However, identifying which feature representations embedded in CNN
models are responsible for such high prediction accuracy of memorability
remains an open question. To tackle this problem, this study sought to identify
memorability-related feature representations in CNN models using brain
similarity. Specifically, memorability prediction accuracy and brain similarity
were examined and assessed by Brain-Score across 16,860 layers in 64 CNN models
pretrained for object recognition. A clear tendency was shown in this
comprehensive analysis that layers with high memorability prediction accuracy
had higher brain similarity with the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, which is
the highest stage in the ventral visual pathway. Furthermore, fine-tuning the
64 CNN models revealed that brain similarity with the IT cortex at the
penultimate layer was positively correlated with memorability prediction
accuracy. This analysis also showed that the best fine-tuned model provided
accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art CNN models developed specifically
for memorability prediction. Overall, this study's results indicated that the
CNN models' great success in predicting memorability relies on feature
representation acquisition similar to the IT cortex. This study advanced our
understanding of feature representations and its use for predicting image
memorability.

have been understood as arising from \textit{rhythmic oscillators with varying

EEG analysis to identify the most prominent populations of neuronal current
sources in terms of their frequency and spectral power. However, emerging
perspectives on EEG highlight its arrhythmic nature, which is primarily
inferred from broadband EEG properties like the ubiquitous $1/f$ spectrum. In
the present study, we use an \textit{arrhythmic superposition of pulses} as a
metaphor to explain the origin of EEG. This conceptualization has a fundamental
problem because the interference produced by the superpositions of pulses
generates colored Gaussian noise, masking the temporal profile of the
generating pulse. We solved this problem by developing a mathematical method
involving the derivative of the autocovariance function to recover excellent
approximations of the underlying pulses, significantly extending the analysis
of this type of stochastic processes. When the method is applied to spontaneous
mouse EEG sampled at $5$ kHz during the sleep-wake cycle, specific patterns --
called $\Psi$-patterns -- characterizing NREM sleep, REM sleep, and wakefulness
are revealed. $\Psi$-patterns can be understood theoretically as \textit{power
density in the time domain} and correspond to combinations of generating pulses
at different time scales. Remarkably, we report the first EEG
wakefulness-specific feature, which corresponds to an ultra-fast ($\sim 1$ ms)
transient component of the observed patterns. By shifting the paradigm of EEG
genesis from oscillators to random pulse generators, our theoretical framework
pushes the boundaries of traditional Fourier-based EEG analysis, paving the way
for new insights into the arrhythmic components of neural dynamics.

which is difficult to process without information loss. In addition, these

resulting in slow forecasting speed. To solve the abovementioned problems, we
propose a Fast Pure Transformer Network (FPTN) in this paper. First, the

spatio-temporal correlations simultaneously in these vectors, we utilize
Transformer encoder and stack it with several layers. Extensive experiments are

FPTN outperforms the state-of-the-art on two metrics. Meanwhile, the

  Matching","Accepted to CVPR 2023. Project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/pats",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Local feature matching aims at establishing sparse correspondences between a
pair of images. Recently, detector-free methods present generally better
performance but are not satisfactory in image pairs with large scale
differences. In this paper, we propose Patch Area Transportation with
Subdivision (PATS) to tackle this issue. Instead of building an expensive image
pyramid, we start by splitting the original image pair into equal-sized patches
and gradually resizing and subdividing them into smaller patches with the same
scale. However, estimating scale differences between these patches is
non-trivial since the scale differences are determined by both relative camera
poses and scene structures, and thus spatially varying over image pairs.
Moreover, it is hard to obtain the ground truth for real scenes. To this end,
we propose patch area transportation, which enables learning scale differences
in a self-supervised manner. In contrast to bipartite graph matching, which
only handles one-to-one matching, our patch area transportation can deal with
many-to-many relationships. PATS improves both matching accuracy and coverage,
and shows superior performance in downstream tasks, such as relative pose
estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation. The source code

transport has attracted considerable attention in recent years, both for its
intriguing physics and for its potential applications in superconducting
circuits. This study shows that planar Josephson junctions (JJs) based on
type-II Weyl semimetal (WSM) MoTe2 can exhibit a prominent SDE due to the
emergence of asymmetric Josephson effect (AJE) in perpendicular magnetic
fields. As a result of the AJE, the critical supercurrents Ic are very
asymmetrical regarding the current direction [/Delta]Ic. [/Delta]Ic can also be
modulated effectively by an external magnetic field. As a result of the
inversion symmetry breaking in WSM, all these results are in agreement with
theoretically predicted intrinsic AJEs. The field-tunable AJE allows us to
demonstrate the rectification of supercurrent in such MoTe2 JJs, with
rectification efficiency up to 17%, paving the way for their application in
superconducting electronics.

previous methods mainly use images of artistic faces for style transfer while
ignoring arbitrary style images such as abstract paintings. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel method, namely Face-guided Dual Style Transfer
(FDST). To begin with, FDST employs a 3D decoupling module to separate facial
geometry and texture. Then we propose a style fusion strategy for facial
geometry. Subsequently, we design an optimization-based DDSG mechanism for
textures that can guide the style transfer by two style images. Besides the
normal style image input, DDSG can utilize the original face input as another
style input as the face prior. By this means, high-quality face arbitrary style
transfer results can be obtained. Furthermore, FDST can be applied in many
downstream tasks, including region-controllable style transfer, high-fidelity
face texture reconstruction, large-pose face reconstruction, and artistic face
reconstruction. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that
our method can achieve comparable performance. All source codes and pre-trained

from source speaker to synthesized speech of a target speaker's timbre. In most
previous methods, the synthesized fine-grained prosody features often represent
the source speaker's average style, similar to the one-to-many problem(i.e.,
multiple prosody variations correspond to the same text). In response to this
problem, a strength-controlled semi-supervised style extractor is proposed to
disentangle the style from content and timbre, improving the representation and
interpretability of the global style embedding, which can alleviate the
one-to-many mapping and data imbalance problems in prosody prediction. A
hierarchical prosody predictor is proposed to improve prosody modeling. We find
that better style transfer can be achieved by using the source speaker's
prosody features that are easily predicted. Additionally, a
speaker-transfer-wise cycle consistency loss is proposed to assist the model in
learning unseen style-timbre combinations during the training phase.
Experimental results show that the method outperforms the baseline. We provide

models explaining it, however, assumptions of a simple linear elastic and
quasi-static deformation before yielding made his model idealistic. At the same
time, the quasi-static pre-yielding deformation assumption open-up the
possibility for pre-yielding viscous and plastic deformation in the absence of
quasi-static conditions. Most early models followed Oldroyds pre-yielding
linear elastic assumption. Here, we discuss the structural parameters based
thixotropic non-linear elasto-viscoplastic constitutive model valid for
reversible and irreversible thixotropic materials. In this work, we have
considered non-linear elastic and plastic behaviours before yielding. Despite
being a simple algebraic equation, our model explains both the viscosity
plateau at low shear rates and the diverging zero shear rate viscosity, using
the same parameters but different shear histories. Our model also predicts
experimentally observable transient and steady-state shear banding.
Furthermore, our model effectively predicts waiting-time-dependent stress
overshoot during startup flow, stress hysteresis in shear ramps, sudden
stepdown shear rate test results, and viscosity bifurcation phenomena. At the
steady state, it reduces to either Bingham, Herschel Bulkley type, or Newtonian
fluids model, depending on shear histories. Our model requires only four and
five for the irreversible and reversible model, respectively, compared to six

model favourably predicts recent experimental results. The current framework

supernova (SN) 2021ckj. Spectral modeling of SN 2021ckj reveals that its
composition is dominated by oxygen, carbon and iron group elements, and the
photospheric velocity at peak is ~10000 km/s. From the light curve (LC)
modeling applied to SNe 2021ckj, 2019hgp, and 2021csp, we find that the ejecta
and CSM properties of Type Icn SNe are diverse. SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp likely
have two ejecta components (an aspherical high-energy component and a spherical
standard-energy component) with a roughly spherical CSM, while SN 2019hgp can
be explained by a spherical ejecta-CSM interaction alone. The ejecta of SNe
2021ckj and 2021csp have larger energy per ejecta mass than the ejecta of SN
2019hgp. The density distribution of the CSM is similar in these three SNe, and
is comparable to those of Type Ibn SNe. This may imply that the mass-loss
mechanism is common between Type Icn (and also Type Ibn) SNe. The CSM masses of
SN 2021ckj and SN 2021csp are higher than that of SN 2019hgp, although all
these values are within the diversity seen in Type Ibn SNe. The early spectrum
of SN 2021ckj shows narrow emission lines from C II and C III, without a clear
absorption component, in contrast with that observed in SN 2021csp. The
similarity of the emission components of these lines implies that the emitting
regions of SNe 2021ckj and 2021csp have similar ionization states, and thus

  Understandability? An Empirical Investigation on the Developers Perception",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background. Code understandability is fundamental. Developers need to clearly
understand the code they are modifying. A low understandability can increase
the amount of coding effort and misinterpretation of code has impact on the
entire development process. Ideally, developers should write clear and
understandable code with the least possible effort. Objective. The goal of this
work is to investigate if the McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity or the Cognitive
Complexity can be a good predictor for the developers' perceived code
understandability to understand which of the two complexities can be used as
criteria to evaluate if a piece of code is understandable. Method. We designed
and conducted an empirical study among 216 junior developers with professional
experience ranging from one to four years. We asked them to manually inspect
and rate the understandability of 12 Java classes that exhibit different levels
of Cyclomatic and Cognitive Complexity. Results. Cognitive Complexity slightly
outperforms the Cyclomatic Complexity to predict the developers' perceived
understandability. Conclusion. The identification of a clear and validated
measure for Code Complexity is still an open issue. Neither the old fashioned
McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity and the most recent Cognitive Complexity are good
predictors for code understandability, at least when considering the complexity
perceived by junior developers.

knowledge alone is often inadequate. Language models frequently encode overly
general structures of a sentence and fail to cover specific cases needed to use
phonetic knowledge. Also, a handcrafted post-processing system is needed to
address the problems relevant to the tone of the characters. However, the

description of glasses, but the nature is not yet clear. The difficulty is how
to find order in disordered systems. The usual treatment of glass as an
exceptional case causes serious internal inconsistencies in thermodynamics. The
issue turns out to be ascribed to a fundamental problem of defining state
variables in thermodynamics. This study provides a coherent understanding of
the nature of order parameters for glasses and crystals, starting from the
fundamental issue of defining state variables in thermodynamics. The state
variable is defined as the time-averaged value of a dynamical variable under
the constraint conditions, provided that the time average converges to a unique
value. This property is called time invariance. It gives the same value at any
time it is measured once an equilibrium is established. From this definition,
it is deduced that the state variables of a solid are the time-averaged
positions of all atoms constituting the solid, regardless of periodicity. The
general properties of order parameters are fully compatible with the time
invariance of state variables. For glass, equilibrium positions are state
variables and order parameters too. Because equilibrium positions are order
parameters, any property determined by equilibrium positions can also be an
order parameter. This explains why many quantities can be used for order
parameters. Symmetry introduces redundancy among the averaged positions of the
atoms, reducing the number of independent state variables. The often-claimed
association of order to periodicity lacks generality as explained by abundant
examples of well-ordered material, such as DNA. Order in thermodynamics means
the time invariance.

investigating brain responses to natural speech. The speech envelope is crucial
for speech understanding, encompassing cues for processing linguistic units. In
this study, we aimed to test the potential of the neural envelope tracking
technique for detecting language impairments in individuals with aphasia (IWA).
[Approach]. We recorded EEG from 27 IWA in the chronic phase after stroke and
22 controls while they listened to a story. We quantified neural envelope
tracking in a broadband frequency range as well as in the delta, theta, alpha,
beta, and gamma frequency bands using mutual information analysis. Besides
group differences in neural tracking measures, we also tested its suitability
for detecting aphasia using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We
further investigated the required recording length for the SVM to detect
aphasia and to obtain reliable outcomes. [Results]. IWA displayed decreased
neural envelope tracking compared to controls in the broad, delta, theta, and
gamma band. Neural tracking in these frequency bands effectively captured
aphasia at the individual level (SVM accuracy 84%, AUC 88%). High-accuracy and
reliable detection could be obtained with 5-7 minutes of recording time.
[Significance]. Our study shows that neural tracking of speech is an effective
biomarker for aphasia. We demonstrated its potential as a diagnostic tool with
high reliability, individual-level detection of aphasia, and time-efficient
assessment. This work represents a significant step towards more automatic,
objective, and ecologically valid assessments of language impairments in

enabled by broadband low-frequency radio observations. By Faraday tomography,
it is possible to obtain the Faraday dispersion function which contains
information on the line-of-sight distributions of magnetic fields, thermal
electron density, and cosmic-ray electron density by measuring the polarization
spectrum from a source of synchrotron radiation over a wide band. Furthermore,
by combining it with 2-dimensional imaging, Faraday tomography allows us to
explore the 3-dimensional structure of polarization sources. The application of
Faraday tomography has been active in the last 20 years, when broadband
observation has become technically feasible. However, the Faraday dispersion
function is mathematically the Fourier transform of the polarization spectrum,
and since the observable band is finite, it is impossible to obtain a complete
Faraday dispersion function by performing Fourier transform. In addition, the
Faraday dispersion function does not directly reflect the distribution of
magnetic field, thermal-electron density, and cosmic-ray electron density in
the physical space, and its physical interpretation is not straightforward.
Despite these two difficult problems, Faraday tomography is attracting much
attention because it has great potential as a new method for studying cosmic
magnetic fields and magnetized plasmas. In particular, the next-generation
radio telescope SKA (Square Kilometre Array) is capable of polarization
observation with unprecedented sensitivity and broad bands, and the application
of Faraday tomography is expected to make dramatic progress in the field of
cosmic magnetic fields. In this review, we explain the basics of Faraday
tomography with simple and instructive examples. Then representative algorithms
to realize Faraday tomography are introduced and finally some applications are
shown.

lattice. We aim to (a) develop the linked cluster expansion for these lattices,
a novel application, and (b) to further understand the surprising convergence
efficiency of the linked cluster method, as well as its limitations. We obtain
several key results. First, we show that for nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians of a
specific form, all finite treelike clusters can be mapped to one dimensional
finite chains. We then show that the qualitative distinction between the Cayley
tree and Bethe lattice appears due to differing lattice constants that is a
result of the Bethe lattice being boundaryless. We use these results to obtain
the explicit closed-form formula for the zero-field susceptibility for the
entire disordered phase up to the critical point for Bethe lattices of
arbitrary degree; remarkably, only 1D chainlike clusters contribute. We also
obtain the exact zero field partition function for the Ising model on both
trees with only the two smallest clusters, similar to the 1D chain. Finally,
these results achieve a direct comparison between an infinite lattice with a
nonnegligible boundary and one without any boundary, allowing us to show that
the linked cluster expansion eliminates boundary terms at each order of the
expansion, answering the question about its surprising convergence efficiency.
We conclude with some ramifications of these results, and possible

that the mismatch moir\'e potential is too weak to produce significant

effective masses around the $\Gamma$-point and the band flattening are
\textit{reduced} with twisting. As an alternative approach, we show (i) that
reducing the interlayer distance by uniform vertical pressure can significantly
increase the effective mass of the moir\'e hole, and (ii) that the moir\'e
depth and its band flattening effects are strongly enhanced by accessible
electric gating fields perpendicular to the heterobilayer, with resulting
electron and hole effective masses increased by more than an order of magnitude

the solution to this problem arises when the BH is immersed in an external

the BH spin, the induced electric field accelerates electrons outward and
protons inward at spherical polar angles $-60^\circ\lesssim \theta \lesssim
60^\circ$ (hereafter polar region), and vice versa at $60^\circ\lesssim \theta
\lesssim 120^\circ$ (hereafter equatorial region). For an antiparallel magnetic
field, protons and electrons exchange their roles. The particles that are
accelerated outward radiate off energy and angular momentum to infinity. The BH
powers the process by reducing its energy and angular momentum by capturing
polar protons and equatorial electrons with net negative energy and angular
momentum. The electric potential allows for negative energy states outside the
BH ergosphere, so the latter does not play any role in this electrodynamical BH
energy extraction process.

exposure time increased the measured hydrogen content in the specimen's apex
region, cryo preparation revealed, that the hydrogen uptake in magnesium is
independent of the employment of conventional or cryogenic FIB preparation. TEM
measurements demonstrated the growth of a (111) MgO oxide layer with 3-4 nm
thickness on the basal (0001) plane of the Mg atom probe specimen. APT data
further revealed the formation of an aluminum-rich region between bulk Mg and
the native oxide. The aluminum enrichment of up to ~20 at.% at the interface is
consistent with an inward growth of the oxide scale.

distorted radiation patterns and low radiation efficiencies. In this paper,
starting from the analytical correlation and efficiency models, we investigate

guarantees are of the inferential type. We use PML to show that differential
privacy admits an inferential formulation: it describes the information leaking
about a single entry in a database assuming that every other entry is known,
and considering the worst-case distribution on the data. Moreover, we define
inferential instance privacy (IIP) as a bound on the (non-conditional)

of distances between pedestrians and the stability of those distances over time
is introduced. The method allows the recognition of groups using trajectories
only and thus opens up the possibility of studying crowds in public places
without constrains caused by privacy protection issues. Trajectories from a
railway platform in Switzerland were used to analyse the waiting behaviour of
passengers in dependence of waiting time as well as the size of social groups.
The analysis of the trajectories shows that the portion of passengers
travelling in groups reaches up to 10\% during the week and increases to 20 \%
on the weekends. 60\% of the groups were pairs, larger groups were less
frequent. With increasing group size, the mean speed of the members decreases.
Individuals and pairs often choose waiting spots at the sides of the stairs and
in vicinity of obstacles, while larger groups wait close to the platform
entries. The results indicate that passengers choose waiting places according
to the following criteria and ranking: shortest ways, direction of the next
intended action, undisturbed places and ensured communication. While individual
passengers often wait in places where they are undisturbed and do not hinder
others, the dominating comfort criterion for groups is to ensure communication.
The results regarding space requirements of waiting passengers could be used
for different applications. E.g. to enhance the level of service concept
assessing the comfort of different types of users, to avoid temporary
bottlenecks to improve the boarding and alighting process or to increase the
robustness of the performance of railway platforms during peak loads by

$\nu_\lambda=\mathrm{law}\left(\sum_{j \geq 0} \xi_j \lambda^j\right)$ on
$\mathbb{R}$, where $|\lambda|<1$ and the $\xi_j \sim \nu$ are independent,
identically distributed with respect to a measure $\nu$ finitely supported on
$\mathbb{Z}$. One example of this is the classical Bernoulli convolution. It is
known that for certain combinations of algebraic $\lambda$ and $\nu$ uniform on
an interval, $\nu_\lambda$ is absolutely continuous and its Fourier transform
has power decay (\cite{garsia1}, \cite{feng}); in the proof, it is exploited
that for these combinations, a quantity called the Garsia entropy
$h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal.
  We show that absolute continuity and power Fourier decay occur when $\lambda$

combinations for which this is the case. We find that if an algebraic $\lambda$
without a Galois conjugate of modulus exactly one has a $\nu$ such that
$h_{\lambda}(\nu)$ is maximal, then all Galois conjugates of $\lambda$ must be
smaller in modulus than one and $\nu$ must satisfy a certain finite set of
linear equations in terms of $\lambda$.

detect the most commons-compatible implementation, the different implementation

parallel and accelerated by scaling up the cluster horizontally on demand. In
spite of that, load balancing has been a challenging issue in all distributed
RDBMSs, including shared-nothing ones, which suffers much from skewed data
distribution. In this work, we focus on one of the representative operator,
namely Hash Join, and investigate how skewness among the nodes of a cluster
will affect the load balance and eventual efficiency of an arbitrary query in
shared-nothing RDBMSs. We found that existing Distributed Hash Join (Dist-HJ)
solutions may not provide satisfactory performance when a value is skewed in
both the probe and build tables. To address that, we propose a novel Dist-HJ
solution, namely Partition and Replication (PnR). Although PnR provide the best
efficiency in some skewness scenario, our exhaustive experiments over a group
of shared-nothing RDBMSs show that there is not a single Dist-HJ solution that
wins in all (data skew) scenarios. To this end, we further propose a
self-adaptive Dist-HJ solution with a builtin sub-operator cost model that
dynamically select the best Dist-HJ implementation strategy at runtime
according to the data skew of the target query. We implement the solution in
our commercial shared-nothing RDBMSs, namely KaiwuDB (former name ZNBase) and
empirical study justifies that the self-adaptive model achieves the best

is to generate timelines of relevant resuscitation activities, including

analyse the changes in mobility behaviours, focusing on the sustainability
level of modal choices caused by the pandemic in two countries with different

transport means was the most used for three different trip purposes (grocery
shopping, non-grocery shopping and commuting) both before and during the first
wave of the pandemic. The variation in the sustainability level of modal
choices was then observed through descriptive statistics and significance
tests. By estimating three multinomial logistic regression models, one for each
trip purpose, we tried to identify which factors, beyond the country, affected
the variation in the sustainability level of the modal choice with the
beginning of the pandemic. Results show a greater reduction in mobility among
the Italian sample compared to the Swedish one, especially for public transit,
and a major inclination by Swedes in travelling by foot and by bike compared to
Italians, also due to the greater possibility of making trips during the first
wave of the pandemic. Finally, perceived safety on public transit seems to have
no significant effects on the variation in the sustainability level of the
modal choice with the beginning of restrictions. Our results can be used as a
starting point for a discussion on how the COVID-19 pandemic affected attitudes

capabilities are envisioned to be deployed within human bloodstreams. Such
devices are envisaged to enable fine-grained sensing-based applications for
detecting events for early indications of various health conditions, as well as
actuation-based ones such as the targeted drug delivery. Intuitively,
associating the locations of such events with the events themselves would
provide an additional utility for precision diagnostics and treatment. This
vision recently yielded a new class of in-body localization coined under the
term ""flow-guided nanoscale localization"". Such localization can be piggybacked
on THz-based communication for detecting body regions in which events were
observed based on the duration of one circulation of a nanodevice in the
bloodstream. From a decades-long research on objective benchmarking of
""traditional"" indoor localization, as well as its eventual standardization
(e.g., ISO/IEC 18305:2016), we know that in early stages the reported
performance results were often incomplete (e.g., targeting a subset of relevant
metrics), carrying out benchmarking experiments in different evaluation
environments and scenarios, and utilizing inconsistent performance indicators.
To avoid such a ""lock-in"" in flow-guided localization, in this paper we discuss
a workflow for standardized evaluation of such localization. The workflow is
implemented in the form of an open-source framework that is able to jointly
account for the mobility of the nanodevices in the bloodstream, in-body THz
communication between the nanodevices and on-body anchors, and energy-related
and other technological constraints at the nanodevice level. Accounting for
these constraints, the framework is able to generate the raw data that can be
streamlined into different flow-guided solutions for generating standardized
performance benchmarks.

  Semantic Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Seed area generation is usually the starting point of weakly supervised
semantic segmentation (WSSS). Computing the Class Activation Map (CAM) from a
multi-label classification network is the de facto paradigm for seed area
generation, but CAMs generated from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Transformers are prone to be under- and over-activated, respectively, which
makes the strategies to refine CAMs for CNNs usually inappropriate for
Transformers, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose a Unified optimization
paradigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) for both types of networks, in which
the objective function to be optimized consists of two terms: One is a
generation loss, which controls the shape of seed areas by a temperature
parameter following a deterministic principle for different types of networks;
The other is a regularization loss, which ensures the consistency between the
seed areas that are generated by self-adaptive network adjustment from
different views, to overturn false activation in seed areas. Experimental
results show that USAGE consistently improves seed area generation for both
CNNs and Transformers by large margins, e.g., outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a mIoU of 4.1% on PASCAL VOC. Moreover, based on the USAGE-generated
seed areas on Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art WSSS results on both
PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.

to distinguish between different notions of eventual nonnegativity: (i) uniform
eventual nonnegativity means that $e^{tA}$ maps $X_+$ into $X_+$ for all

$\langle x', e^{tA} x \rangle$ is in $[0,\infty)$ for all $t$ larger than an

social recommender systems neglect the entanglement of the latent factors over

Learning the disentangled representations with relation heterogeneity poses
great challenge for social recommendation. In this work, we design a
Disentangled Graph Neural Network (DGNN) with the integration of latent memory

temperature dependence at very low temperatures. This is contrary to the
conventional formula based on the CNT. Furthermore, the estimated energy

Traditionally, Sea ice has been modeled as a continuum under Eulerian
coordinates to describe its large-scale features, using, for instance,
viscous-plastic rheology. Recently, Lagrangian particle models, also known as
the discrete element method (DEM) models, have been utilized for characterizing
the motion of individual sea ice fragments (called floes) at scales of 10 km
and smaller, especially in marginal ice zones. This paper develops a multiscale
model that couples the particle and the continuum systems to facilitate an
effective representation of the dynamical and statistical features of sea ice
across different scales. The multiscale model exploits a Boltzmann-type system
that links the particle movement with the continuum equations. For the
small-scale dynamics, it describes the motion of each sea ice floe. Then, as
the large-scale continuum component, it treats the statistical moments of mass
density and linear and angular velocities. The evolution of these statistics
affects the motion of individual floes, which in turn provides bulk feedback
that adjusts the large-scale dynamics. Notably, the particle model
characterizing the sea ice floes is localized and fully parallelized, in a
framework that is sometimes called superparameterization, which significantly
improves computation efficiency. Numerical examples demonstrate the effective
performance of the multiscale model. Additionally, the study demonstrates that
the multiscale model has a linear-order approximation to the truth model.

characterise solutions to equations in groups in terms of formal languages. We
begin with the work of Ciobanu, Diekert and Elder, who showed that solutions to
systems of equations in free groups in terms of reduced words are expressible
as EDT0L languages. We provide a sketch of their algorithm, and describe how
the free group results extend to hyperbolic groups. The characterisation of
solutions as EDT0L languages is very robust, and many group constructions
preserve this, as shown by Levine.
  The most recent progress in the area has been made for groups without
negative curvature, such as virtually abelian, the integral Heisenberg group,
or the soluble Baumslag-Solitar groups, where the approaches to describing the
solutions are different from the negative curvature groups. In virtually
abelian groups the solutions sets are in fact rational, and one can obtain them
as $m$-regular sets. In the Heisenberg group producing the solutions to a
single equation reduces to understanding the solutions to quadratic Diophantine
equations and uses number theoretic techniques. In the Baumslag-Solitar groups
the methods are combinatorial, and focus on the interplay of normal forms to
solve particular classes of equations.
  In conclusion, EDT0L languages give an effective and simple combinatorial
characterisation of sets of seemingly high complexity in many important classes
of groups.

incorporate structural information to sequence-based models, but they only mine
part of token-level hierarchical structure information. In this paper, we
analyze how the complete hierarchical structure influences the tokens in code
sequences and abstract this influence as a property of code tokens called
hierarchical embedding. The hierarchical embedding is further divided into
statement-level global hierarchy and token-level local hierarchy. Furthermore,
we propose the Hierarchy Transformer (HiT), a simple but effective sequence
model to incorporate the complete hierarchical embeddings of source code into a
Transformer model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical embedding
on learning code structure with an experiment on variable scope detection task.
Further evaluation shows that HiT outperforms SOTA baseline models and show
stable training efficiency on three source code-related tasks involving

It is however still uncertain if a supermassive star still emerges when

the interplay of collisions and accretion in star clusters at low metallicity.
We model a small embedded cluster of accreting protostars following sub-parsec
scale fragmentation during the collapse of a primordial gas cloud and follow
its evolution by performing $N$-body plus hydrodynamical simulations. Our
results show that supermassive stars with 10$^3$ and 10$^4$ M$_\odot$ are

prioritized manipulation order decisions based on given target designations. We
utilize a Hierarchical Stacking Relationship Network (HSRN) to discriminate the
hierarchy of stacking and generate a refined Stacking Relationship Tree (SRT)
for relationship description. Considering that objects with high stacking
stability can be grasped together if necessary, we introduce an elaborate
decision-making planner based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision
Process (POMDP), which leverages observations and generates the least
grasp-consuming decision chain with robustness and is suitable for
simultaneously specifying multiple targets. To verify our work, we set the
scene to the dining table and augment the REGRAD dataset with a set of common

Transformer (ViT) to the FER task. However, ViT cannot fully utilize emotional
features extracted from raw images and requires a lot of computing resources.
To overcome these problems, we propose a quaternion orthogonal transformer
(QOT) for FER. Firstly, to reduce redundancy among features extracted from
pre-trained ResNet-50, we use the orthogonal loss to decompose and compact
these features into three sets of orthogonal sub-features. Secondly, three
orthogonal sub-features are integrated into a quaternion matrix, which
maintains the correlations between different orthogonal components. Finally, we
develop a quaternion vision transformer (Q-ViT) for feature classification. The
Q-ViT adopts quaternion operations instead of the original operations in ViT,
which improves the final accuracies with fewer parameters. Experimental results
on three in-the-wild FER datasets show that the proposed QOT outperforms
several state-of-the-art models and reduces the computations.

intention part takes context representations as input to generate the intention
of the response. Then the generation part generates words depending on sentence
representations. Therefore, the hierarchical information has been fused into

However, when fusing multiple observations from a neural network in a semantic

outliers and decreases the robustness of the resulting map. In this work, we
propose a novel robust fusion method to combine multiple Bayesian semantic
predictions. Our method uses the uncertainty estimation provided by a Bayesian
neural network to calibrate the way in which the measurements are fused. This
is done by regularizing the observations to mitigate the problem of
overconfident outlier predictions and using the epistemic uncertainty to weigh
their influence in the fusion, resulting in a different formulation of the
probability distributions. We validate our robust fusion strategy by performing
experiments on photo-realistic simulated environments and real scenes. In both
cases, we use a network trained on different data to expose the model to
varying data distributions. The results show that considering the model's
uncertainty and regularizing the probability distribution of the observations
distribution results in a better semantic segmentation performance and more
robustness to outliers, compared with other methods.

feature representations and effective facial shape constraints, nor can they
accurately predict the value of each element in the landmark heatmap, limiting
their detection accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a novel Reference

cooperate with each other to encourage the accurate transformation of the
reference heatmap information and facial shape constraints. Then, a Multi-Scale

enhance feature representations for producing more accurate target heatmaps. To

one for measurement induced transitions of monitored quantum systems and one
for entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. These Lagrangians,
previously proposed on grounds of replica symmetry, are derived in a controlled
regime for an illustrative family of tensor networks. They have different forms
in the two cases, and involve distinct replica limits. The perturbative RG is
controlled by working close to a critical dimensionality, ${d_c=6}$ for
measurements and ${d_c=10}$ for random tensors, where interactions become
marginal. The resulting RG flows are surprising in several ways. They indicate
that in high dimensions $d>d_c$ there are at least two (stable) universality
classes for each kind of transition, separated by a nontrivial tricritical
point. In each case one of the two stable fixed points is Gaussian, while the
other is nonperturbative. In lower dimensions, $d<d_c$, the flow always runs to
the nonperturbative regime. This picture clarifies the ""mean-field theory"" of
these problems, including the phase diagram of all-to-all quantum circuits. It
suggests a way of reconciling exact results on tree tensor networks with field
theory. Most surprisingly, the perturbation theory for the random tensor
network (which also applies to a version of the measurement transition with
""forced"" measurements) formally possesses a dimensional reduction property
analogous to that of the random-field Ising model. When only the leading
interactions are retained, perturbative calculations in $d$ dimensions reduce
to those in a simple scalar field theory in ${d-4}$ dimensions. We show that
this holds to all orders by writing the action in a superspace formulation.

autoregressive and non-autoregressive. Autoregressive methods rely on the
Markov assumption and can achieve high accuracy in the early stages of
prediction when errors are not yet accumulated. However, their performance
tends to decline as the number of time steps increases. In contrast,
non-autoregressive methods can achieve relatively high performance but lack
correlation between predictions for each time step. In this paper, we propose
an Implicit Stacked Autoregressive Model for Video Prediction (IAM4VP), which
is an implicit video prediction model that applies a stacked autoregressive
method. Like non-autoregressive methods, stacked autoregressive methods use the
same observed frame to estimate all future frames. However, they use their own
predictions as input, similar to autoregressive methods. As the number of time
steps increases, predictions are sequentially stacked in the queue. To evaluate
the effectiveness of IAM4VP, we conducted experiments on three common future

commonly leads to socially worse outcomes, such as defect-defect in the
iterated stag hunt (ISH). Previous works address this challenge by sharing
rewards or shaping their opponents' learning process, which require too strong
assumptions. In this paper, we demonstrate that agents trained to optimize
expected returns are more likely to choose a safe action that leads to
guaranteed but lower rewards. However, there typically exists a risky action
that leads to higher rewards in the long run only if agents cooperate, e.g.,
cooperate-cooperate in ISH. To overcome this, we propose using action value
distribution to characterize the decision's risk and corresponding potential
payoffs. Specifically, we present Adaptable Risk-Sensitive Policy (ARSP). ARSP
learns the distributions over agent's return and estimates a dynamic
risk-seeking bonus to discover risky coordination strategies. Furthermore, to
avoid overfitting training opponents, ARSP learns an auxiliary opponent
modeling task to infer opponents' types and dynamically alter corresponding
strategies during execution. Empirically, agents trained via ARSP can achieve
stable coordination during training without accessing opponent's rewards or
learning process, and can adapt to non-cooperative opponents during execution.
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method to learn coordination
strategies between agents both in iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) and
iterated stag hunt (ISH) without shaping opponents or rewards, and can adapt to
opponents with distinct strategies during execution. Furthermore, we show that
ARSP can be scaled to high-dimensional settings.

higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear

diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the

However, content producers on alt-tech social media platforms are not always

Specifically, we describe differences in video production across 27 co-active

exploring the relations of neighboring frames via the residual feature. In this
way, a three-branch spatial-temporal attention layer with an adaptive

forgetting (CF) as the decision boundaries for old classes can become
inaccurate when perturbated by new ones. Existing literature have applied the
data augmentation (DA) to alleviate the model forgetting, while the role of DA
in OCI has not been well understood so far. In this paper, we theoretically
show that augmented samples with lower correlation to the original data are
more effective in preventing forgetting. However, aggressive augmentation may
also reduce the consistency between data and corresponding labels, which
motivates us to exploit proper DA to boost the OCI performance and prevent the
CF problem. We propose the Enhanced Mixup (EnMix) method that mixes the
augmented samples and their labels simultaneously, which is shown to enhance
the sample diversity while maintaining strong consistency with corresponding
labels. Further, to solve the class imbalance problem, we design an Adaptive

provide several examples of relatively simple ordinary differential equations
where the phenomenon arises, and to develop additional practical methodologies
for its study.
  In particular, we show how the higher-order Stokes phenomenon may be derived
through the hyperterminant representation of the late-term divergence of an
asymptotic expansion developed by Olde Daalhuis (J. Comp. Appl. Math. vol. 76,
1996, pp. 255-264). Lower-order components of the factorial-over-power
divergence are considered, for which late-late-term divergence arises. Borel
resummation of these lower-order components reveals the higher-order Stokes
phenomenon, in which new components of the late-terms of the expansion are
smoothly switched on with an error function dependence. The techniques are
firstly demonstrated with a second-order linear inhomogeneous ODE that

object instances with a mask of the fixed resolution, e.g., 28*28 grid.
However, a low-resolution mask loses rich details, while a high-resolution mask
incurs quadratic computation overhead. It is a challenging task to predict the
optimal binary mask for each instance. In this paper, we propose to dynamically
select suitable masks for different object proposals. First, a dual-level
Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) with adaptive feature aggregation is developed to
gradually increase the mask grid resolution, ensuring high-quality segmentation
of objects. Specifically, an efficient region-level top-down path (r-FPN) is
introduced to incorporate complementary contextual and detailed information
from different stages of image-level FPN (i-FPN). Then, to alleviate the
increase of computation and memory costs caused by using large masks, we
develop a Mask Switch Module (MSM) with negligible computational cost to select
the most suitable mask resolution for each instance, achieving high efficiency
while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Without bells and whistles, the
proposed method, namely DynaMask, brings consistent and noticeable performance
improvements over other state-of-the-arts at a moderate computation overhead.

the safety risk in traffic conflicts. Typically, SSMs rely on assumptions
regarding the future evolution of traffic participant trajectories to generate
a measure of risk. As a result, they are only applicable in scenarios where
those assumptions hold. To address this issue, we present a novel data-driven
Probabilistic RISk Measure derivAtion (PRISMA) method. The PRISMA method is
used to derive SSMs that can be used to calculate in real time the probability
of a specific event (e.g., a crash). Because we adopt a data-driven approach to
predict the possible future evolutions of traffic participant trajectories,
less assumptions on these trajectories are needed. Since the PRISMA is not
bound to specific assumptions, multiple SSMs for different types of scenarios
can be derived. To calculate the probability of the specific event, the PRISMA
method uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the occurrence probability of
the specified event. We further introduce a statistical method that requires
fewer simulations to estimate this probability. Combined with a regression
model, this enables our derived SSMs to make real-time risk estimations.
  To illustrate the PRISMA method, an SSM is derived for risk evaluation during
longitudinal traffic interactions. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to
objectively compare the relative merits of two SSMs. Instead, we provide a
method for benchmarking our derived SSM with respect to expected risk trends.
The application of the benchmarking illustrates that the SSM matches the
expected risk trends.
  Whereas the derived SSM shows the potential of the PRISMA method, future work
involves applying the approach for other types of traffic conflicts, such as
lateral traffic conflicts or interactions with vulnerable road users.

when modern language models were scaled to billions of learned parameters.
Without modifying a large language model's weights, it can be tuned to perform
various downstream natural language tasks simply by including concatenated
training examples of these tasks in its input. Though disruptive for many
practical applications of large language models, this emergent learning
paradigm is not well understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper,
we propose a first-of-its-kind PAC based framework for in-context learnability,
and use it to provide the first finite sample complexity results for the
in-context learning setup. Our framework includes an initial pretraining phase,
which fits a function to the pretraining distribution, and then a second
in-context learning phase, which keeps this function constant and concatenates
training examples of the downstream task in its input. We use our framework in
order to prove that, under mild assumptions, when the pretraining distribution
is a mixture of latent tasks (a model often considered for natural language
pretraining), these tasks can be efficiently learned via in-context learning,
even though the model's weights are unchanged and the input significantly
diverges from the pretraining distribution. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that in this setting, in-context learning is more about identifying the task
than about learning it, a result which is in line with a series of recent
empirical findings. We hope that the in-context learnability framework

  Imaging Systems",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Reliable classification and detection of certain medical conditions, in
images, with state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks, require vast
amounts of pixel-wise annotation. However, the public availability of such
datasets is minimal. Therefore, semantic segmentation with image-level labels
presents a promising alternative to this problem. Nevertheless, very few works
have focused on evaluating this technique and its applicability to the medical
sector. Due to their complexity and the small number of training examples in
medical datasets, classifier-based weakly supervised networks like class
activation maps (CAMs) struggle to extract useful information from them.
However, most state-of-the-art approaches rely on them to achieve their
improvements. Therefore, we propose a framework that can still utilize the
low-quality CAM predictions of complicated datasets to improve the accuracy of
our results. Our framework achieves that by first utilizing lower threshold
CAMs to cover the target object with high certainty; second, by combining
multiple low-threshold CAMs that even out their errors while highlighting the
target object. We performed exhaustive experiments on the popular multi-modal
BRATS and prostate DECATHLON segmentation challenge datasets. Using the
proposed framework, we have demonstrated an improved dice score of up to 8% on
BRATS and 6% on DECATHLON datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art.

Two well-known classes of filtering algorithms to solve the localization

a novel filtering algorithm that takes the best from two classes. We evaluate
the multiparticle Kalman filter in symmetric and noisy environments. Such

analyzing data in virtual environments together with a peer. In this article,
we investigate different designs for making spatio-temporal references, i.e.,
visually highlighting virtual data artifacts, within the context of
Collaborative Immersive Analytics. The ability to make references to data is
foundational for collaboration, affecting aspects such as awareness, attention,
and common ground. Based on three design options, we implemented a variety of
approaches to make spatial and temporal references in an immersive virtual
reality environment that featured abstract visualization of spatio-temporal
data as 3D Radar Charts. We conducted a user study (n=12) to empirically
evaluate aspects such as aesthetic appeal, legibility, and general user
preference. The results indicate a unified favour for the presented location
approach as a spatial reference while revealing trends towards a preference of
mixed temporal reference approaches dependent on the task configuration:
pointer for elementary, and outline for synoptic references. Based on immersive
data visualization complexity as well as task reference configuration, we argue
that it can be beneficial to explore multiple reference approaches as
collaborative information cues, as opposed to following a rather uniform user

blur always remains in the astronomical images corrected by Single Conjugate AO
(SCAO) systems due to fitting and bandwidth errors, which can mathematically be
described by a convolution of the true image with a point spread function
(PSF). Due to the nature of the turbulent atmosphere and its correction, the
PSF is spatially varying, which is known as aniosplanatic effect. The PSF
serves, e.g., as a quality measure for the science images and therefore needs
to be known as accurately as possible.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm for PSF reconstruction in directions
apart from the guide star direction in an SCAO system adapted to the needs of
GSMTs focused on estimating the contribution of the anisoplanatic and

algorithm for Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics from (Wagner, 2018) is combined
with an algorithm for time-dependent atmospheric tomography from (Niebsch,

  Results obtained in an end-to-end simulation tool show a qualitatively good
reconstruction of the PSF compared to the PSF calculated directly from the
simulated incoming wavefront as well as a stable performance with respect to

Glauber MC and UrQMD predicts drastically different $N_{part}$ distributions.
The impact parameter $b$ and the number of charged particles $N_{ch}$ on the

role in our study of the regularity of flows, as well as a careful

those who know less about the benefits disclose less on social media. According
to the analysis, users who know more about self-disclosure risks share less on

This is a crucial quantity to infer the ionising photon budget of the Universe.
These objects were selected to have reliable spectroscopic redshifts, assigned
based on the profile of their Lyman-$\alpha$ emission line, detected in the
MUSE deep fields. We exploit medium-band observations from the JWST
extragalactic medium band survey (JEMS) to find the flux excess corresponding
to the redshifted \ha\ emission line. We estimate the ultra-violet (UV)
luminosity by fitting the full JEMS photometry, along with several HST
photometric points, with \texttt{Prospector}. We find a median UV continuum
slope of $\beta = -2.09^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ for the sample, indicating young
stellar populations with little-to-no dust attenuation. Supported by this, we
derive $\xi_{ion,0}$ with no dust attenuation and find a median value of
log$\frac{\xi_{ion,0}}{\text{Hz erg}^{-1}} = 25.44^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$. If we
perform dust attenuation corrections and assume a Calzetti attenuation law, our
values are lowered by $\sim 0.1$ dex. Our results suggest Lyman-$\alpha$
emitters at the Epoch of Reionisation have enhanced $\xi_{ion,0}$ compared to
previous estimations from literature, in particular, when compared to the
non-Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting population. This initial study provides a promising
outlook on the characterisation of ionising photon production in the early

  Models","Accepted to CVPR 2023. Project page is at https://slide-3d.github.io",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mesh generation is of great value in various applications involving computer
graphics and virtual content, yet designing generative models for meshes is
challenging due to their irregular data structure and inconsistent topology of
meshes in the same category. In this work, we design a novel sparse latent
point diffusion model for mesh generation. Our key insight is to regard point
clouds as an intermediate representation of meshes, and model the distribution
of point clouds instead. While meshes can be generated from point clouds via
techniques like Shape as Points (SAP), the challenges of directly generating
meshes can be effectively avoided. To boost the efficiency and controllability
of our mesh generation method, we propose to further encode point clouds to a
set of sparse latent points with point-wise semantic meaningful features, where
two DDPMs are trained in the space of sparse latent points to respectively
model the distribution of the latent point positions and features at these
latent points. We find that sampling in this latent space is faster than
directly sampling dense point clouds. Moreover, the sparse latent points also
enable us to explicitly control both the overall structures and local details
of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments are conducted on the ShapeNet
dataset, where our proposed sparse latent point diffusion model achieves
superior performance in terms of generation quality and controllability when
compared to existing methods.

revolution, which are technologically empowered by the Internet of Things and
real-time data analysis. Information collected from industrial assets is
produced in a continuous fashion, yielding data streams that must be processed
under stringent timing constraints. Such data streams are usually subject to
non-stationary phenomena, causing that the data distribution of the streams may
change, and thus the knowledge captured by models used for data analysis may
become obsolete (leading to the so-called concept drift effect). The early
detection of the change (drift) is crucial for updating the model's knowledge,
which is challenging especially in scenarios where the ground truth associated
to the stream data is not readily available. Among many other techniques, the
estimation of the model's confidence has been timidly suggested in a few
studies as a criterion for detecting drifts in unsupervised settings. The goal
of this manuscript is to confirm and expose solidly the connection between the
model's confidence in its output and the presence of a concept drift,
showcasing it experimentally and advocating for a major consideration of
uncertainty estimation in comparative studies to be reported in the future.

extracted from RGB video, enabling remote health monitoring at low cost.
Advancements in remote pulse estimation -- or remote photoplethysmography

approaches are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets with associated
ground truth from contact-PPG sensors. We present the first non-contrastive
unsupervised learning framework for signal regression to break free from the
constraints of labelled video data. With minimal assumptions of periodicity and
finite bandwidth, our approach is capable of discovering the blood volume pulse
directly from unlabelled videos. We find that encouraging sparse power spectra
within normal physiological bandlimits and variance over batches of power
spectra is sufficient for learning visual features of periodic signals. We
perform the first experiments utilizing unlabelled video data not specifically
created for rPPG to train robust pulse rate estimators. Given the limited
inductive biases and impressive empirical results, the approach is
theoretically capable of discovering other periodic signals from video,
enabling multiple physiological measurements without the need for ground truth
signals. Codes to fully reproduce the experiments are made available along with
the paper.

remarkable success, there have been few approaches on TTV for its extension to

framework given only a pretrained TTI model and a single <text, video> pair,
which we term Edit-A-Video. The framework consists of two stages: (1) inflating
the 2D model into the 3D model by appending temporal modules and tuning on the
source video (2) inverting the source video into the noise and editing with
target text prompt and attention map injection. Each stage enables the temporal
modeling and preservation of semantic attributes of the source video. One of
the key challenges for video editing include a background inconsistency
problem, where the regions not included for the edit suffer from undesirable
and inconsistent temporal alterations. To mitigate this issue, we also
introduce a novel mask blending method, termed as sparse-causal blending (SC
Blending). We improve previous mask blending methods to reflect the temporal
consistency so that the area where the editing is applied exhibits smooth
transition while also achieving spatio-temporal consistency of the unedited
regions. We present extensive experimental results over various types of text

challenge in various fields of text processing under the title of ""automatic
text summarisation"". Manual processing and summarisation of large volumes of
textual data is a very difficult, expensive, time-consuming and impossible
process for human users. Text summarisation systems are divided into extractive
and abstract categories. In the extractive summarisation method, the final
summary of a text document is extracted from the important sentences of the
same document without any modification. In this method, it is possible to
repeat a series of sentences and to interfere with pronouns. However, in the
abstract summarisation method, the final summary of a textual document is
extracted from the meaning and significance of the sentences and words of the
same document or other documents. Many of the works carried out have used
extraction methods or abstracts to summarise the collection of web documents,
each of which has advantages and disadvantages in the results obtained in terms
of similarity or size. In this work, a crawler has been developed to extract
popular text posts from the Instagram social network with appropriate
preprocessing, and a set of extraction and abstraction algorithms have been
combined to show how each of the abstraction algorithms can be used.
Observations made on 820 popular text posts on the social network Instagram
show the accuracy (80%) of the proposed system.

of the saturation and critical behavior of infinite nuclear matter. The free
energy of a nucleus is parametrized using the density and temperature-dependent
liquid-drop model and interaction among nucleons is worked out within the
effective relativistic mean-field theory (E-RMF). The effective mass (m,$^*$)
and critical temperature of infinite symmetric nuclear matter ($T_c$) of a
given E-RMF parameter force play a seminal role in the estimation of thermal
properties. A larger (m$^*$) and $T_c$ of the E-RMF set estimate larger
excitation energy, level density, and limiting temperature $(T_l)$ for a given
nucleus. The limiting temperature of a nucleus also depends on the behavior of
the nuclear gas surrounding the nucleus, making the equation of state (EoS) at
subsaturation densities an important input. A stiff EoS in the subsaturation
region estimates a higher pressure of the nuclear gas making it less stable.
Since the $T_c$ plays an important part in these calculations, we perform a
Pearson correlation statistical study of fifteen E-RMF parameter sets,
satisfying the relevant constraint on EoS. Effective mass seems to govern the

information. Indeed, it is caused by a sharp variation in the sound speed,
therefore carrying localised information. One such glitch is the helium glitch
caused by the hydrogen and first and second partial helium ionisation region,
allowing us to constrain the surface helium abundance. However, the function
adjusted to the glitch signature depends non-linearly on the acoustic depth at
which it occurs, He. Retrieving the faint glitch signature and estimating
$\tau_{\textrm{He}}$ are difficult but crucial tasks to accurately measure the
glitch parameters and, ultimately, accurately infer the helium abundance.
  In the present paper, we aim at providing a way to estimate
$\tau_{\textrm{He}}$ using precise seismic indicators, independent of stellar
modelling. Consequently, we aim at improving the WhoSGlAd (Whole Spectrum and
Glitches Adjustment) method by automatically providing a model independent
measure of the glitch's parameters.
  We compute the evolution of $T_{\textrm{He}}$, a dimensionless form of the
acoustic depth, along a grid of models and adjust an empirical linear relation
between $T_{\textrm{He}}$ and the mean large separation and frequency ratio as
defined in WhoSGlAd. We further optimise over the value of this estimate to
ensure the stability and accuracy of the approach.
  The proposed approach provides an excellent estimate of the acoustic depth
and allows us to swiftly retrieve the glitch signature of observed spectra. We
demonstrate that the we can accurately model the helium abundance of four
Kepler targets by comparing model (both versions of WhoSGlAd) and literature
values.

in-context from example demonstrations. Despite progress, theoretical
understanding of this phenomenon remains limited. We argue that in-context

learning abilities arise from generic next-token prediction when the
pretraining distribution has sufficient amounts of compositional structure,
under linguistically motivated assumptions. A second bound provides a
theoretical justification for the empirical success of prompting LLMs to output
intermediate steps towards an answer. To validate theoretical predictions, we
introduce a controlled setup for inducing in-context learning; unlike previous
approaches, it accounts for the compositional nature of language. Trained
transformers can perform in-context learning for a range of tasks, in a manner
consistent with the theoretical results. Mirroring real-world LLMs in a
miniature setup, in-context learning emerges when scaling parameters and data,
and models perform better when prompted to output intermediate steps. Probing
shows that in-context learning is supported by a representation of the input's

have been devoted to creating multiphoton entanglement by multiplexing existing
biphoton sources with linear optics and postselections. Different from all
previous protocols, here we report, for the first time, the observation of
continuous-mode time-energy-entangled W-class triphotons with an unprecedented
generation rate directly through the process of spontaneous six-wave mixing
(SSWM) in a four-level triple-Lambda atomic vapor cell. Facilitated by
electromagnetically induced transparency and coherence control, our SSWM scheme
enables versatile narrowband triphoton generation with many intriguing
properties including long temporal coherence and controllable waveforms, ideal
for implementing long-distance quantum communications, networking, and
information processing by interfacing photons and atoms. Most importantly, our
work paves a way for the development of a reliable and efficient genuine
triphoton source, thus making the research on multiphoton entanglement within
easy reach.

epoch in order to derive an accurate PBH mass function. We also briefly
consider PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch. Our
investigation confirms that, for nearly scale-invariant spectra, PBH abundances
on the QCD scale are enhanced by a factor $\sim 10^3$ compared to a purely
radiation dominated Universe. For a power spectrum producing an (almost)
scale-invariant PBH mass function outside of the transition, we find a peak
mass of $M_{\rm pbh}\approx 1.9 M_{\odot}$ of which a fraction $f\approx
1.5\times 10^{-2}$ of the PBHs have a mass of $M_{\rm pbh} > 10 M_{\odot}$,
possibly contributing to the LIGO-Virgo black hole merger detections. We point
out that the physics of PBH formation during the $e^+e^-$-annihilation epoch is
more complex as it is very close to the epoch of neutrino decoupling. We argue
that neutrinos free-streaming out of overdense regions may actually hinder PBH

circumstellar discs. We propose the continuous processing of PAHs through
clustering, adsorption on dust grains, and their reverse-processes as key
mechanisms to reduce the emission-capable PAH abundance in protoplanetary
discs. This cycle of processing is driven by vertical turbulence in the disc
mixing PAHs between the disc midplane and the photosphere. We used a
theoretical Monte Carlo model for photodesorption and a coagulation code in the
disc midplane to estimate the relevance and timescale of these processes in a
Herbig Ae/Be disc environment. By combining these components in a 1D vertical
model, we calculated the gas-phase depletion of PAHs that stick as clusters on
dust grains. Our results show that the clustering of gas-phase PAHs is very
efficient, and that clusters with more than 100 monomers can grow for years
before they are able to freeze out in the disc midplane. Once a PAH cluster is
frozen on the dust grain surface, the large heat capacity of these clusters
prevents them from evaporating off the grains in UV-rich environments such as
the photosphere. Therefore, the clustering of PAHs followed by freeze-out can
lead to a depletion of gas-phase PAHs in discs. Evaluated over the lifetime of
protoplanetary discs, we find a depletion of PAHs by a factor that ranges
between 50 and 1000 compared to the standard ISM abundance of PAHs in the inner
disc through turbulent processing. Through these processes, we favour PAHs
smaller than circumovalene as the major gas-phase emitters of the disc
photosphere as larger PAH monomers cannot photodesorb from the grain surface.
These gas-phase PAHs co-exist with large PAH clusters sticking on dust grains.
We find a close relation between the amount of PAHs frozen out on dust grains
and the dust population, as well as the strength of the vertical turbulence.

metals has been researched now for more than a decade, and its main aspects are
well understood. Crucial in converting s-wave singlet pairs in the
superconductor to s-wave triplets in the ferromagnet is the engineering of
well-defined magnetic inhomogeneity (the 'generator') at the interface with the
superconductor. Vertical layer stacks are typically used as such, where two
separate thin ferromagnetic layers with homogeneous but non-collinear
magnetizations, provide the inhomogeneity. Alternatively, magnetic textures,
like ferromagnetic domain walls and vortices, are possible triplet generators,
although they are far less studied. In this paper we review our experiments on
lateral disk-shaped Josephson junctions where a ferromagnetic bottom layer
provides a weak link with a vortex magnetization imposed by the shape of the
disk. We present three different junction configurations, exhibiting their own
generator mechanism. In the first, we utilize the non-collinearity with a
second ferromagnetic layer to produce the triplet correlations. The second
configuration consists of only the bottom ferromagnet and the superconducting
contacts; it relies on the vortex magnetization itself to generate the
spin-polarized supercurrents. In the third case we exploit an intrinsic
generator by combining a conventional superconductor (NbTi) and a half-metallic
ferromagnetic oxide (La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$). We find strong supercurrents
in all cases. A particularly interesting finding is that the supercurrents are
strongly confined at the rims of the device, independent of the generating
mechanism, but directly related to their triplet nature. What causes these rim
currents remains an open question.

Its elementary
constituent, monolayer graphene, is generally expected to inherit most of the
parent material's properties including chemical inertness. Here we show that,
unlike graphite, defect-free monolayer graphene exhibits a strong activity with
respect to splitting molecular hydrogen, which is comparable to that of
metallic and other known catalysts for this reaction. We attribute the
unexpected catalytic activity to surface corrugations (nanoscale ripples), a
conclusion supported by theory. Nanoripples are likely to play a role in other
chemical reactions involving graphene and, because nanorippling is inherent to
atomically thin crystals, can be important for two dimensional materials in
general.

is then used to estimate the critical temperature $T_c$, pressure $P_c$ and
density $\rho_c$ of the symmetric nuclear matter for the liquid-gas phase

theoretical calculations, there is a large uncertainty around its value.
Although, the critical parameters are correlated among themselves. It is
revealed that vector self-coupling $\zeta_0$ of used forces play determining
role in EoS in finite temperature limit. Keeping the incompressibility in
acceptable limit i.e. 240$\pm$ 20 MeV, the lower value of $\zeta_0$ gives a
better result of $T_c$ when compared to the several experimental data. The
critical parameters however show weak correlation with the properties at
saturation density at zero temperature. The compressibility factors calculated
with these parameters are in agreement with the universal value of liquid-gas
systems. Stability conditions are examined along with binodal and spinodal
regions. Besides this, the thermodynamic properties like specific heat and
latent heat are also worked out. We have carried out detailed consistency check
of our calculations using critical exponents and standard scaling laws. All the
exponents are well within the theoretical mean-field results.

the predictive performance and uncertainty estimates of deep learning
approaches. However, they are widely criticised as being computationally
expensive, due to the need to deploy multiple independent models. Recent work
has challenged this view, showing that for predictive accuracy, ensembles can
be more computationally efficient (at inference) than scaling single models
within an architecture family. This is achieved by cascading ensemble members
via an early-exit approach. In this work, we investigate extending these
efficiency gains to tasks related to uncertainty estimation. As many such
tasks, e.g. selective classification, are binary classification, our key novel
insight is to only pass samples within a window close to the binary decision
boundary to later cascade stages. Experiments on ImageNet-scale data across a
number of network architectures and uncertainty tasks show that the proposed
window-based early-exit approach is able to achieve a superior
uncertainty-computation trade-off compared to scaling single models. For
example, a cascaded EfficientNet-B2 ensemble is able to achieve similar
coverage at 5% risk as a single EfficientNet-B4 with <30% the number of MACs.
We also find that cascades/ensembles give more reliable improvements on OOD

taken as the number of production sources is growing to infinity, coupled with
an intrinsic parameter regime ensuring that the mean number of items per source

combined growth should be fast enough. In the opposite regime referred to as

inhomogeneous Poisson process in inverted time. These results are illustrated

Methods: Retrospective study that involve 34 patients with lung cancer
confirmed by histology and EGFR status mutation assessment. A total of 2.205

variables is a core problem in causal discovery. Most approaches proposed for
this task, namely additive noise models (ANM), are only adequate for
quantitative data. We propose a criterion to address the cause-effect problem
with categorical variables (living in sets with no meaningful order), inspired
by seeing a conditional probability mass function (pmf) as a discrete
memoryless channel. We select as the most likely causal direction the one in
which the conditional pmf is closer to a uniform channel (UC). The rationale is
that, in a UC, as in an ANM, the conditional entropy (of the effect given the
cause) is independent of the cause distribution, in agreement with the
principle of independence of cause and mechanism. Our approach, which we call
the uniform channel model (UCM), thus extends the ANM rationale to categorical
variables. To assess how close a conditional pmf (estimated from data) is to a
UC, we use statistical testing, supported by a closed-form estimate of a UC
channel. On the theoretical front, we prove identifiability of the UCM and show
its equivalence with a structural causal model with a low-cardinality exogenous
variable. Finally, the proposed method compares favorably with recent
state-of-the-art alternatives in experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real

multiple clients and a server. FL focuses on protecting clients' data but turns
out to be highly vulnerable to Intellectual Property (IP) threats. Since FL
periodically collects and distributes the model parameters, a free-rider can
download the latest model and thus steal model IP. Split Federated Learning
(SFL), a recent variant of FL that supports training with resource-constrained
clients, splits the model into two, giving one part of the model to clients
(client-side model), and the remaining part to the server (server-side model).
Thus SFL prevents model leakage by design. Moreover, by blocking prediction
queries, it can be made resistant to advanced IP threats such as traditional
Model Extraction (ME) attacks. While SFL is better than FL in terms of
providing IP protection, it is still vulnerable. In this paper, we expose the
vulnerability of SFL and show how malicious clients can launch ME attacks by
querying the gradient information from the server side. We propose five
variants of ME attack which differs in the gradient usage as well as in the
data assumptions. We show that under practical cases, the proposed ME attacks
work exceptionally well for SFL. For instance, when the server-side model has

word constructive is construed here in two senses - first, as in constructive
mathematics, whereby the logic underlying proofs is intuitionistic. In a second
sense of the word, constructive is taken to mean built up from simpler
components. Preferences are defined over lotteries that vary continuously over
some topological space and are themselves assumed to vary depending upon some
underlying process of measurement, deliberation, or observation. The open sets
of the topology serve as the possible truth values of assertions about
preference and constrain what can be measured, deduced, or observed. Replacing
an open set by an open covering of smaller sets serves as a notion of
refinement of information, and deductions made for these smaller sets can be
combined or collated to yield corresponding deductions over the larger set. The
two notions of constructive turn out to be related because the underlying logic
of the objects within the system is generally intuitionistic. The classical
expected utility theorem is shown to be non-constructive, and a constructive
version is proved for the present setting by narrowing the domain of
preferences. The representation of preferences is via comparisons of continuous
real-valued functions. A version of the classical theorem is obtained by
imposing a restriction on the collection of open sets of the topology, which
has the effect of making the logic classical. The proof here illustrates a
robustness property of constructive results. They can be carried over virtually
unchanged to a variety of mathematical settings. Here the set of variable
lotteries replaces the sets of lotteries from the classical setting, but there
are other possibilities.

equal to $\alpha \sqrt{m_{p}/m_{e}}=0.313$, where $\alpha$ is the fine

This interaction resonance causes the confinement of the pair in the BIC state
with the positive binding energy of 1.531 of the electron mass. The integral
equation for the bispinor wave function is derived. This normalized wave
function which must be complex, was found numerically in the momentum and

the electron is equal to 48Fm, and the average radius for the proton is equal
to 1.1Fm. This composite particle can exist exclusively in the free state, in

reconstructed images. This raises the question of how to design robust DL
methods for MRI reconstruction. To address this problem, we propose a novel
image reconstruction framework, termed SMOOTHED UNROLLING (SMUG), which
advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized
smoothing (RS)-based robust learning operation. RS, which improves the
tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design
of adversarial defense for image classification. Yet, we find that the
conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL process is ineffective for
MRI reconstruction. We show that SMUG addresses the above issue by customizing
the RS operation based on the unrolling architecture of the DL-based MRI
reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach and several variants
of SMUG, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with
respect to a diverse set of perturbation sources, including perturbations to

  with active learning using a multi-model data service for the travel nursing
  industry","Masters thesis",,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The challenges of using inadequate online recruitment systems can be
addressed with machine learning and software engineering techniques.
Bi-directional personalization reinforcement learning-based architecture with
active learning can get recruiters to recommend qualified applicants and also
enable applicants to receive personalized job recommendations. This paper
focuses on how machine learning techniques can enhance the recruitment process
in the travel nursing industry by helping speed up data acquisition using a
multi-model data service and then providing personalized recommendations using
bi-directional reinforcement learning with active learning. This need was
especially evident when trying to respond to the overwhelming needs of
healthcare facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. The need for traveling
nurses and other healthcare professionals was more evident during the lockdown
period. A data service was architected for job feed processing using an
orchestration of natural language processing (NLP) models that synthesize
job-related data into a database efficiently and accurately. The multi-model
data service provided the data necessary to develop a bi-directional
personalization system using reinforcement learning with active learning that
could recommend travel nurses and healthcare professionals to recruiters and
provide job recommendations to applicants using an internally developed smart
match score as a basis. The bi-directional personalization reinforcement
learning-based architecture with active learning combines two personalization
systems - one that runs forward to recommend qualified candidates for jobs and
another that runs backward and recommends jobs for applicants.

  Rich Representation of Twitter and Market data","24 page",,,,"q-fin.ST cs.AI cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stock market forecasting has been a challenging part for many analysts and
researchers. Trend analysis, statistical techniques, and movement indicators
have traditionally been used to predict stock price movements, but text
extraction has emerged as a promising method in recent years. The use of neural
networks, especially recurrent neural networks, is abundant in the literature.
In most studies, the impact of different users was considered equal or ignored,
whereas users can have other effects. In the current study, we will introduce
TM-vector and then use this vector to train an IndRNN and ultimately model the
market users' behaviour. In the proposed model, TM-vector is simultaneously
trained with both the extracted Twitter features and market information.
Various factors have been used for the effectiveness of the proposed
forecasting approach, including the characteristics of each individual user,
their impact on each other, and their impact on the market, to predict market
direction more accurately. Dow Jones 30 index has been used in current work.
The accuracy obtained for predicting daily stock changes of Apple is based on
various models, closed to over 95\% and for the other stocks is significant.
Our results indicate the effectiveness of TM-vector in predicting stock market
direction.

  Imperfect CSI",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of a
two-timescale transmission design in cell-free massive multi-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems incorporating reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs) under the assumption of imperfect channel state information
(CSI). We examine the Rician channel model and formulate the passive
beamforming for the RISs based on statistical channel state information
(S-CSI). To that end, we put forth a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimator with the aim of estimating the aggregation of channels from the users
to the APs within each channel coherence interval. Meanwhile, the active
beamforming for the radio units (APs) is executed using the maximum ratio
combining (MRC) approach, which utilizes the instantaneous aggregated channels,
that result from the combination of the direct and reflected channels from the
RISs. Subsequently, we derive the closed-form expressions of the achievable
uplink spectral efficiency (SE), which is a function of S-CSI elements such as
distance-dependent path loss, Rician factors as well as the number of RIS
elements and AP antennas. We then optimize the phase shifts of the RISs to
maximize the sum SE of the users, utilizing the soft actor-critic (SAC) which
is a deep reinforcement learning (RL) method, and relying on the derived
closed-form expressions. Numerical evaluations affirm that, despite the
presence of imperfect CSI, the deployment of RIS in cell-free systems can lead
to significant performance improvement.

  Course","5 pages",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  ChatGPT has recently gathered attention from the general public and academia
as a tool that is able to generate plausible and human-sounding text answers to
various questions. One potential use, or abuse, of ChatGPT is in answering
various questions or even generating whole essays and research papers in an
academic or classroom setting. While recent works have explored the use of
ChatGPT in the context of humanities, business school, or medical school, this
work explores how ChatGPT performs in the context of an introductory computer
engineering course. This work assesses ChatGPT's aptitude in answering quizzes,
homework, exam, and laboratory questions in an introductory-level computer
engineering course. This work finds that ChatGPT can do well on questions
asking about generic concepts. However, predictably, as a text-only tool, it
cannot handle questions with diagrams or figures, nor can it generate diagrams
and figures. Further, also clearly, the tool cannot do hands-on lab
experiments, breadboard assembly, etc., but can generate plausible answers to
some laboratory manual questions. One of the key observations presented in this
work is that the ChatGPT tool could not be used to pass all components of the
course. Nevertheless, it does well on quizzes and short-answer questions. On
the other hand, plausible, human-sounding answers could confuse students when
generating incorrect but still plausible answers.

pivotal role in set theory, with ramifications that extend to many areas of
mathematics. This article extends earlier findings with a fresh look at the
critical facts of Cantor's theory: i) Cantor's widely renowned Diagonalization
Argument (CDA) is fully refuted by a set of counter-examples that expose the
fallacy of this proof. ii) The logical inconsistencies of CDA are revisited,
exposing the short-comings of CDA's implementation of the method of proof by
contradiction. iii) The denumerability of the power set of the set of the
natural numbers, P(N), is substantiated by a proof that takes full account of
all the infinite subsets of N. Such a result confirms the denumerability of the
set of the real numbers, R, and with it the countable nature of the continuum.
iv) Given that the denumerable character of (probably) all infinite sets makes
their comparison in terms of one-to-one correspondences a rather pointless
exercise, a new concept of relative cardinality is introduced which facilitates
a quantitative evaluation of their different magnitudes.

faithful and animatable 3D facial surfaces from a single image. The facial
surface is influenced by the coarse shape, as well as the static detail (e,g.,
person-specific appearance) and dynamic detail (e.g., expression-driven
wrinkles). Previous work struggles to decouple the static and dynamic details
through image-level supervision, leading to reconstructions that are not
realistic. In this paper, we aim at high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction and
propose HiFace to explicitly model the static and dynamic details.
Specifically, the static detail is modeled as the linear combination of a
displacement basis, while the dynamic detail is modeled as the linear
interpolation of two displacement maps with polarized expressions. We exploit
several loss functions to jointly learn the coarse shape and fine details with
both synthetic and real-world datasets, which enable HiFace to reconstruct
high-fidelity 3D shapes with animatable details. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that HiFace presents state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and faithfully recovers both the static and dynamic
details. Our project page can be found at https://project-hiface.github.io

absorption can be tuned for longer NIR wavelengths. However, on increasing the
size of the nanoparticle, the scattering is enhanced and thus is not suitable
for plasmonic therapeutics. Therefore, to overcome this issue, different types
of small gold nanorods were synthesized and converted into stable aggregates to
red-shift the plasmonic resonance wavelength to longer near-infrared
wavelengths. The gold nanorod aggregates were embedded into the agarose gel
phantoms mimicking the tumor-tissue-like structure. The photothermal response
was measured through the prepared phantoms using a broadband near-infrared
light source. It was shown that even in an extremely dilute concentration of
gold nanorods, the photothermal heat generation could increase after the
aggregation and also give gives deeper penetration of thermal energy. The
observed photothermal response was also verified through numerical simulation.
The current study shows better performance by increasing the plasmonic
coupling, reducing the mismatch issue of plasmonic resonance shift in the
second biological therapeutic window for the aggregates without increasing the
size of individual nanoparticles. The aggregates provide better light
penetration at deeper tissue by red-shifting the absorbance resonance

aggregates detections from various automatically learned augmented views to
improve the robustness of pseudo label generation. Since not all pseudo labels
from APG are beneficially informative, the subsequent `Criticize' phase is

study presents solutions for two fundamental challenges in materials synthesis:
predicting the outcome of a synthesis from specified reaction parameters and
correlating sets of parameters to obtain products with desired outcomes. Four
machine learning algorithms, including random forest, logistic regression,
support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbor, were trained to predict the
phase and particle size of iron oxide based on experimental conditions. Among
the models, random forest exhibited the best performance, achieving 96% and 81%

Premutation feature importance analysis shows that most models (except logistic

Unit (ReLU) networks without conditional computation, it is known that
memorizing a collection of $n$ input-output relationships can be accomplished
via a neural network with $O(\sqrt{n})$ neurons. Calculating the output of this
neural network can be accomplished using $O(\sqrt{n})$ elementary arithmetic
operations of additions, multiplications and comparisons for each input. Using
a conditional ReLU network, we show that the same task can be accomplished
using only $O(\log n)$ operations per input. This represents an almost
exponential improvement as compared to networks without conditional
computation. We also show that the $\Theta(\log n)$ rate is the best possible.
Our achievability result utilizes a general methodology to synthesize a
conditional network out of an unconditional network in a
computationally-efficient manner, bridging the gap between unconditional and

helical state, monoaxial chiral helimagnets have a continuum of helical states
differing by the wave number of the modulation. The wave number of these states
in units of the equilibrium state wave number is denoted here by p, and
accordingly the corresponding states are called the p-states. In this work we
study in detail the metastability of the p-states. The application of an
external magnetic field in the direction of the chiral axis has a double
effect: on one hand, it introduces a conical deformation of the p-states, and
on the other hand it destabilizes some of them, shrinking the range of p in
which the p-states are metastable. If a polarized current is applied along the
chiral axis, the p-states reach a steady moving state with a constant velocity
proportional to the current intensity. Besides this dynamical effect, the
polarized current also induces a conical deformation and reduces the range of
stability of the p-states. The stability diagram in the plane applied field -
applied current intensity has interesting features that, among other things,
permit the manipulation of p-states by a combination of applied fields and
currents. These features can be exploited to devise processes to switch between
p-states. In particular there are p-states with negative p, opening the
possibility to helicity switching. The theoretical feasibility of such
processes, crucial from the point of view of applications, is shown by
micromagnetic simulations. Analogous $p$-states exists in cubic chiral
helimagnets and therefore similar effects are expected in those systems.

Memory-efficient Bidirectional Transformer (MeBT) for end-to-end learning of

bidirectional transformers, our method learns to decode the entire
spatio-temporal volume of a video in parallel from partially observed patches.
The proposed transformer achieves a linear time complexity in both encoding and
decoding, by projecting observable context tokens into a fixed number of latent
tokens and conditioning them to decode the masked tokens through the
cross-attention. Empowered by linear complexity and bidirectional modeling, our
method demonstrates significant improvement over the autoregressive

doublet model with quark flavor mixing. In general, off-diagonal components of
quark Yukawa interactions with additional Higgs bosons are strongly constrained
by the data for flavor changing neutral currents. However, top-charm quark
mixing is not the case, so that a large off-diagonal element can be taken,
which can contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the universe. It turns
out that CP violating phases of the off-diagonal element in the source term in
the Boltzmann equation are eliminated by the rephasing. This result is somewhat
different from previous works on electroweak baryogenesis by flavor
off-diagonal Yukawa couplings. Instead, we find that the absolute value of the
top-charm off-diagonal element enhances CP violating phases in the Higgs
potential, by which sufficient amount of the baryon number can be generated to
explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe. We find that such a
scenario is viable under the current experimental data. The model can be tested
by the current and future measurements of various flavor experiments like Kaon
rare decays, in addition to high energy collider experiments as well as

detect the disease early. A potentially effective way of detecting early cancer
lesions developing along the airway walls (epithelium) is bronchoscopy. To this
end, developments in bronchoscopy offer three promising noninvasive modalities
for imaging bronchial lesions: white-light bronchoscopy (WLB), autofluorescence
bronchoscopy (AFB), and narrow-band imaging (NBI). While these modalities give
complementary views of the airway epithelium, the physician must manually
inspect each video stream produced by a given modality to locate the suspect
cancer lesions. Unfortunately, no effort has been made to rectify this
situation by providing efficient quantitative and visual tools for analyzing
these video streams. This makes the lesion search process extremely
time-consuming and error-prone, thereby making it impractical to utilize these
rich data sources effectively. We propose a framework for synchronizing
multiple bronchoscopic videos to enable an interactive multimodal analysis of
bronchial lesions. Our methods first register the video streams to a reference
3D chest computed-tomography (CT) scan to produce multimodal linkages to the
airway tree. Our methods then temporally correlate the videos to one another to
enable synchronous visualization of the resulting multimodal data set.

transferring mass to the primary during its evolution along the sub-giant

the pulsar mass function and the companion mass, we found that this system is
observed at an almost edge-on orbit and hosts a neutron star with a mass of
$1.44 \pm 0.06~M_\odot$, thus suggesting a highly non-conservative mass
accretion phase. The young age of the WD companion is consistent with the

inappropriate for detecting tiny objects as they are designed for the
classification of larger objects, and do not have the spatial resolution to
identify small targets. Specifically, such backbones use max-pooling or a large
stride at early stages in the architecture. This produces lower resolution
feature-maps that can be efficiently processed by subsequent layers. However,
such low-resolution feature-maps do not contain information that can reliably
discriminate tiny objects. To solve this problem we design 'bottom-heavy'
versions of backbones that allocate more resources to processing
higher-resolution features without introducing any additional computational
burden overall. We also investigate if pre-training these backbones on images
of appropriate size, using CIFAR100 and ImageNet32, can further improve
performance on tiny object detection. Results on TinyPerson and WiderFace show
that detectors with our proposed backbones achieve better results than the
current state-of-the-art methods.

multiple conduction-band valleys with an anisotropic effective mass. The
anisotropy and multi-valley degree of freedom offer an unprecedented tunability
of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS as we can control both the valley occupancy via the
application of in-plane strain, and the ratio between the strengths of the
short- and long-range Coulomb interaction by tilting the sample in the magnetic

observe phase transitions from a compressible Fermi liquid to an incompressible

this evolution and the energy gap of the $\nu=1/2$ FQHS depend strongly on

inhabits a representation of the group SO$(3)$ of 3D rotations: scalars,
vectors, tensors, \textit{etc}. One way for a neural network to exploit prior
knowledge of this structure is to enforce SO$(3)$-equivariance throughout its
layers, and several such architectures have been proposed. While general
methods for handling arbitrary SO$(3)$ representations exist, they
computationally intensive and complicated to implement. We show that by
judicious symmetry breaking, we can efficiently increase the expressiveness of
a network operating only on vector and order-2 tensor representations of
SO$(2)$. We demonstrate the method on an important problem from High Energy
Physics known as \textit{b-tagging}, where particle jets originating from
b-meson decays must be discriminated from an overwhelming QCD background. In
this task, we find that augmenting a standard architecture with our method
results in a \ensuremath{2.3\times} improvement in rejection score.

experiments, several assumptions underlying the typical asymptotic confidence
interval construction are violated, such that one has to resort to
computationally expensive methods like the Feldman-Cousins method for obtaining
confidence intervals with proper statistical coverage. By construction, the
computation of intervals at high confidence levels requires fitting millions or
billions of pseudo-experiments, while wasting most of the computational cost on
overly precise intervals at low confidence levels. In this work, a simple
importance sampling method is introduced which reuses pseudo-experiments
produced for all tested parameter values in a single mixture distribution. This
results in a significant error reduction on the estimated critical values,
especially at high confidence levels, and simultaneously yields a correct
interpolation of these critical values between the parameter values at which
the pseudo-experiments were produced. The theoretically calculated performance
is demonstrated numerically using a simple example from the analysis of
neutrino oscillations. The relationship to similar techniques applied in
statistical mechanics and $p$-value computations is discussed.

  Force","17 pages, 10 figures",,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Virtually any object can rotate. While the rotation provides various
intriguing physics cases, the primary picture for atomic nuclei was simple.
Rotational bands have been observed for many nuclei, and their basic picture is
considered to have been established in 1950s. We, however, show that this
traditional picture is superseded with a novel picture arising from basic
characteristics of the nuclear forces. In the traditional view, as stressed by
Aage Bohr in his Nobel lecture, most of heavy nuclei are like axially-symmetric
prolate ellipsoids (i.e., with two shorter axes of equal length), rotating
about one of the short axes, like a rod. In the present picture, however, in
many cases, the lengths of these three axes are all different, called triaxial.
The triaxial shape yields more complex rotations, which actually reproduce
experimental data as shown by state-of-the-art Configuration Interaction
calculations, on supercomputers. The key to differentiate the two pictures is
the nuclear tensor force, which is known to produce the shell evolution in
exotic nuclei, a major agenda of Rare-Isotope physics. We now demonstrate that
the same tensor force generates, in many nuclei, the triaxiality, fading the
prolate-ellipsoid dominance away. The tensor force is a direct consequence of
one $\pi$ meson exchange between nucleons, and the present finding is regarded
as the first explicit or visible case that elementary particles directly affect
nuclear shapes. The importance of the explicit tensor force is in the same line
as Weinberg's modeling of nuclear forces. This feature makes the new picture
robust, and may cast challenges for other many-body systems having forces
similar to the tensor force. Substantial impacts on superheavy nuclei and
fission are anticipated. This study sheds lights on the earlier suggestion of
dominant triaxiality by Davydov, a Ukrainian physicist.

crystallizing fully-ionized $^{12}$C/$^{16}$O and $^{16}$O/$^{20}$Ne mixtures
in white dwarf (WD) cores for two different parametrizations of the corrections
to the linear-mixing energies and with account of ion quantum effects. We
report noticeable composition-dependent deviations of the excess entropy in
both directions from the standard value of 0.77 per ion. Within the same
framework, we evaluate the excess entropy and released or absorbed heat
accompanying the exsolution process in solidified WD layers. The inclusion of
this effect is shown to be important for reliable interpretation of WD cooling
data. We also analyze the latent heat of crystallizing eutectic
$^{12}$C/$^{22}$Ne mixture, where we find a qualitative dependence of both the
phase diagram and the latent heat behaviour on ion quantum effects. This may be
important for the model with $^{22}$Ne distillation in cooling C/O/$^{22}$Ne WD

Modelers must navigate a wide
array of evaluation methodologies implemented with incompatible interfaces
across multiple packages which may give different or even contradictory
results, while ensuring that their chosen approach properly estimates the
performance of their model when generalizing to new observations. Assessing
models fit to spatial data can be particularly difficult, given that model
errors may exhibit spatial autocorrelation, model predictions are often
aggregated to multiple spatial scales by end users, and models are often tasked
with generalizing into spatial regions outside the boundaries of their initial
training data.
  The waywiser package for the R language attempts to make assessing spatial
models easier by providing an ergonomic toolkit for model evaluation tasks,
with functions for multiple assessment methodologies sharing a unified
interface. Functions from waywiser share standardized argument names and
default values, making the user-facing interface simple and easy to learn.
These functions are additionally designed to be easy to integrate into a wide
variety of modeling workflows, accepting standard classes as inputs and
returning size- and type-stable outputs, ensuring that their results are of
consistent and predictable data types and dimensions. Additional features make
it particularly easy to use waywiser along packages and workflows in the

propose a new framework termed CG3D (CLIP Goes 3D) where a 3D encoder is
learned to exhibit zero-shot capabilities. CG3D is trained using triplets of
pointclouds, corresponding rendered 2D images, and texts using natural language

contrastive loss on 3D features obtained from the 3D encoder, as well as visual

train CLIP and the rendered 2D images in CG3D have a distribution shift.
Attempting to train the visual and text encoder to account for this shift
results in catastrophic forgetting and a notable decrease in performance. To
solve this, we employ prompt tuning and introduce trainable parameters in the
input space to shift CLIP towards the 3D pre-training dataset utilized in CG3D.
We extensively test our pre-trained CG3D framework and demonstrate its

To achieve semantic segmentation on a given image, we further introduce a

accretion outbursts, during which the accretion rate and central luminosity are
elevated for several decades. This temporarily increases the disc temperature,
leading to the sublimation of ice species as snowlines move outwards. In this
paper, we investigate how an FUor-type accretion outburst alters the growth and
appearance of dust aggregates at different locations in protoplanetary discs.
We develop a model based on the Monte Carlo approach to simulate locally the
coagulation and fragmentation of icy dust particles and investigate different
designs for their structure and response to sublimation. Our main finding is
that the evolution of dust grains located between the quiescent and outburst
water snowlines is driven by significant changes in composition and porosity.
The time required for the dust population to recover from the outburst and
return to a coagulation/fragmentation equilibrium depends on the complex
interplay of coagulation physics and outburst properties, and can take up to
4500 yr at 5 au. Pebble-sized particles, the building blocks of planetesimals,
are either deprecated in water ice or completely destroyed, respectively
resulting in drier planetesimals or halting their formation altogether. When
accretion outbursts are frequent events, the dust can be far from collisional
equilibrium for a significant fraction of time, offering opportunities to track
past outbursts in discs at millimetre wavelengths. Our results highlight the
importance of including accretion outbursts in models of dust coagulation and
planet formation.

framework for distributed machine learning using training data distributed at
edge devices. This framework enables all edge devices to transmit model updates
simultaneously over the entire available bandwidth, allowing for over-the-air
aggregation. A one-bit digital over-the-air aggregation (OBDA) scheme has been
recently proposed, featuring one-bit gradient quantization at edge devices and
majority-voting based decoding at the edge server. However, the low-resolution
one-bit gradient quantization slows down the model convergence and leads to
performance degradation. On the other hand, the aggregation errors caused by
fading channels in Air-FEEL is still remained to be solved. To address these
issues, we propose the error-feedback one-bit broadband digital aggregation
(EFOBDA) and an optimized power control policy. To this end, we first provide a
theoretical analysis to evaluate the impact of error feedback on the
convergence of FL with EFOBDA. The analytical results show that, by setting an
appropriate feedback strength, EFOBDA is comparable to the Air-FEEL without
quantization, thus enhancing the performance of OBDA. Then, we further
introduce a power control policy by maximizing the convergence rate under
instantaneous power constraints. The convergence analysis and optimized power
control policy are verified by the experiments, which show that the proposed
scheme achieves significantly faster convergence and higher test accuracy in
image classification tasks compared with the one-bit quantization scheme

16 sources exhibit a dust detection, 15 of which are also spectroscopically

rotating black holes (RRBHs) obtained throughout the Newman-Janis algorithm
starting from some popular spherically symmetric regular black holes. It turns
out that if the metric is not an even function of Boyer-Lindquist radial
coordinate r, similarly to the Kerr spacetime, the metric has to be extended to
negative values of r to ensure the analyticity of the geodesic equations (and
in turn of the geodesics). Therefore, some of the extended RRBHs considered in
this paper, such as the rotating Hayward black hole, are geodetically
incomplete because they are singular somewhere for r < 0, and non-analytic at
the ring located in $(r = 0, {\theta = \pi/2})$. Conversely, other spacetimes,
like nonlocal black holes, can be analytically extended to negative r. However,
the real issue shows up at the ring, where, unfortunately, all the RRBHs
studied in this paper fail to be regular. Indeed, at the ring, the Kretschmann
invariant is finite but nonanalytic, while the higher derivative curvature
invariants are divergent. In order to avoid such catastrophe, we propose a
modification of the RRBHs in which the angular momentum is promoted to a
function of the radial coordinate. According to our proposal, the angular
momentum vanishes for $r\rightarrow 0$ and the ring shrinks to a point.
Therefore, the regularity properties of the regular spherically symmetric black
holes are recovered for $r\rightarrow 0$.

challenging terrains. However, robotic quadrupeds are still far behind their
biological counterparts, such as dogs, which display a variety of agile skills
and can use the legs beyond locomotion to perform several basic manipulation
tasks like interacting with objects and climbing. In this paper, we take a step
towards bridging this gap by training quadruped robots not only to walk but
also to use the front legs to climb walls, press buttons, and perform object
interaction in the real world. To handle this challenging optimization, we
decouple the skill learning broadly into locomotion, which involves anything
that involves movement whether via walking or climbing a wall, and
manipulation, which involves using one leg to interact while balancing on the
other three legs. These skills are trained in simulation using curriculum and
transferred to the real world using our proposed sim2real variant that builds
upon recent locomotion success. Finally, we combine these skills into a robust
long-term plan by learning a behavior tree that encodes a high-level task
hierarchy from one clean expert demonstration. We evaluate our method in both
simulation and real-world showing successful executions of both short as well
as long-range tasks and how robustness helps confront external perturbations.

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in never-smoker patients.
However, these mutations are not always carcinogenic, and have recently been
reported in histologically normal lung tissue from patients with and without
lung cancer. To investigate the outcome of EGFR mutation in healthy lung stem
cells, we grew murine alveolar type-II organoids monoclonally in a 3D Matrigel.
Our experiments showed that the EGFR-L858R mutation induced a change in
organoid structure: mutated organoids displayed more `budding', in comparison
to non-mutant controls, which were nearly spherical. On-lattice computational
simulation suggested that this can be explained by an increase in reproductive
fitness combined with inhibitory neighbour-neighbour signalling in mutated
organoids. We predict that these effects prohibit division by cells in the
interior of the organoid and boost the fitness of cells on the surface, since
this differential growth is sufficient to cause `budding' structures in our
simulations. These results suggest that the L858R mutation produces structures
which expand quickly from surface protrusions. We suggest that the likelihood
of L858R-fuelled tumorigenesis is affected not just by random fluctuations in
cell fitness, but by whether the mutation arises in a spatial environment that
allows mutant cells to reproduce without being forced to encounter each other.
These data may have implications for cancer prevention strategies and for
understanding NSCLC progression.

VDM absorption through its coupling to electron electric (EDM) or magnetic
(MDM) dipole moments, which can be realized in minimal extensions to the
Standard Model and yield the observed abundance through a variety of mechanisms
across the eV\,-\,MeV mass range. We compute the absorption rate of the MDM and

from targets currently in use: Si and Ge crystals and Xe and Ar atoms. We find
that current experiments are already sensitive to VDM parameter space
corresponding to a cosmological freeze-in scenario, and future experiments will
be able to completely exclude MDM and EDM freeze-in models with reheat
temperatures below the electroweak scale. Additionally, we find that while
constraints on the MDM interaction can be related to constraints on axion-like

at the highest densities reached in our Universe. Under these conditions the
cores may undergo a phase transition to deconfined quark matter, which exhibits
approximate conformal symmetry. Using a Bayesian inference setup that utilizes
all available neutron-star measurements and state-of-the-art theoretical
calculations, we demonstrate that in the cores of the most massive stars the
equation of state is consistent with the presence of deconfined quark matter.
We do this by (i) establishing an effective conformal symmetry restoration with
88% credence at the highest densities probed in these objects, and (ii)
demonstrating that the number of active degrees of freedom favors an
interpretation of this finding in terms of the presence of deconfined matter.
The remaining probability for purely hadronic maximal-mass stars arises from
equation-of-state behavior featuring small sound-speed and polytropic-index
values, consistent with a first-order phase transition.

masses $M_\star>10^{11} {\rm M}_\odot$ should contain a sizable fraction of
dark matter within their stellar body. Models indicate that in massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs) dark matter should account for $\sim60\%$ of the
dynamical mass within five effective radii ($5 R_{\rm e}$). Most massive ETGs
have been shaped through a two-phase process: the rapid growth of a compact
core was followed by the accretion of an extended envelope through mergers. The
exceedingly rare galaxies that have avoided the second phase, the so-called
relic galaxies, are thought to be the frozen remains of the massive ETG
population at $z\gtrsim2$. The best relic galaxy candidate discovered to date
is NGC 1277, in the Perseus cluster. We used deep integral field GCMS data to
revisit NGC 1277 out to an unprecedented radius of 6 kpc (corresponding to $5
R_{\rm e}$). By using Jeans anisotropic modelling we find a negligible dark
matter fraction within $5 R_{\rm e}$ ($f_{\rm DM}(5 R_{\rm e})<0.05$; two-sigma
confidence level), which is in tension with the expectation. Since the lack of
an extended envelope would reduce dynamical friction and prevent the accretion
of an envelope, we propose that NGC 1277 lost its dark matter very early or
that it was dark matter deficient ab initio. We discuss our discovery in the
framework of recent proposals suggesting that some relic galaxies may result
from dark matter stripping as they fell in and interacted within galaxy
clusters. Alternatively, NGC 1277 might have been born in a high-velocity
collision of gas-rich proto-galactic fragments, where dark matter left behind a
disc of dissipative baryons. We speculate that the relative velocities of
$\approx2000 {\rm km/s}$ required for the latter process to happen were
possible in the progenitors of the present-day rich galaxy clusters.

galactic nuclei (jetted-AGN). We examine a carefully selected sample of 54
CSOs, and confirm that there are two unrelated classes: an edge-dimmed,
low-luminosity class (CSO 1), and an edge-brightened, high-luminosity class
(CSO 2). Using statistically significant blind tests, we show that CSO 2s
themselves consist of two morphologically distinct classes: CSO 2.0, having
prominent hot-spots at the leading edges of narrow jets and/or narrow lobes;
and CSO 2.2, without prominent hot-spots, and with broad jets and/or lobes. An
intermediate class, CSO 2.1, exhibits mixed properties. The four classes occupy
different, overlapping, portions of the luminosity-size plane, with the sizes
of largest CSOs being $\sim 500$pc. We advance the hypothesis that CSO 2.0s are
young and evolve through CSO 2.1s into CSO 2.2s, which are old (up to $\sim
5000$ yr). Thus CSOs do not evolve into larger types of jetted-AGN, but spend
their whole life cycle as CSOs. The radio emission region energies in the CSO
2s we have studied range from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_\odot {c}^2$ to $\sim 7 \,
M_\odot {c}^2$. We show that the transient nature of CSO 2s, and their
birthrate, can be explained through ignition in the tidal disruption events of
giant stars. We also consider possibilities for tapping the spin energy of the
supermassive black hole, and tapping the energy of the accretion disk, in a
manner similar to, but not the same as, that which occurs in dwarf novae. Our
results demonstrate conclusively that CSOs constitute a large family of AGN in
which we have thus far studied only the brightest. More comprehensive radio
studies, with higher sensitivity, resolution, and dynamic range, will
revolutionize our understanding of AGN and the central engines that power them.

(iii) a long-range electrostatic finite-size correction. Moreover we show that
the LDA, in addition to capturing the bulk term exactly, also produces a

graph-structured data. However, existing graph based applications commonly lack
annotated data. GNNs are required to learn latent patterns from a limited
amount of training data to perform inferences on a vast amount of test data.
The increased complexity of GNNs, as well as a single point of model parameter
initialization, usually lead to overfitting and sub-optimal performance. In
addition, it is known that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this
paper, we push one step forward on the ensemble learning of GNNs with improved
accuracy, generalization, and adversarial robustness. Following the principles
of stochastic modeling, we propose a new method called GNN-Ensemble to
construct an ensemble of random decision graph neural networks whose capacity
can be arbitrarily expanded for improvement in performance. The essence of the
method is to build multiple GNNs in randomly selected substructures in the
topological space and subfeatures in the feature space, and then combine them
for final decision making. These GNNs in different substructure and subfeature
spaces generalize their classification in complementary ways. Consequently,
their combined classification performance can be improved and overfitting on
the training data can be effectively reduced. In the meantime, we show that
GNN-Ensemble can significantly improve the adversarial robustness against
attacks on GNNs.

by a combination of confounding processes that are not fully observable. The
identification of sources from observations of system state is vital for
attribution and prediction, which inform critical policy decisions. The
difficulty of these types of inverse problems lies in the inability to isolate
sources and the cost of simulating computational models. Surrogate models may
enable the many-query algorithms required for source identification, but data
challenges arise from high dimensionality of the state and source, limited
ensembles of costly model simulations to train a surrogate model, and few and
potentially noisy state observations for inversion due to measurement
limitations. The influence of auxiliary processes adds an additional layer of
uncertainty that further confounds source identification. We introduce a
framework based on (1) calibrating deep neural network surrogates to the flow
maps provided by an ensemble of simulations obtained by varying sources, and
(2) using these surrogates in a Bayesian framework to identify sources from
observations via optimization. Focusing on an atmospheric dispersion exemplar,
we find that the expressive and computationally efficient nature of the deep
neural network operator surrogates in appropriately reduced dimension allows
for source identification with uncertainty quantification using limited data.
Introducing a variable wind field as an auxiliary process, we find that a
Bayesian approximation error approach is essential for reliable source
inversion when uncertainty due to wind stresses the algorithm.

Generally, these CNNs are used to perform the traditional image classification

addition, the UMDA algorithm proved to be a promising strategy to combine DML
approaches when there is diversity among them, managing to improve at least

drawbacks: the former does not account for the dynamical evolution of
star-forming regions, while in the latter the time for massive stars to explode
as supernovae can be similar to, or even longer than, the lifetime of
protoplanetary discs. In this paper, we extend the disc enrichment scenario to
include the contribution of 26-Al from the winds of massive stars before they
explode as supernovae. We use N-body simulations and a post-processing analysis
to calculate the amount of enrichment in each disc, and we vary the stellar
density of the star-forming regions. We find that stellar winds contribute to
disc enrichment to such an extent that the Solar system's 26-Al/60-Fe ratio is
reproduced in up to 50 per cent of discs in dense (rho = 1000Msun pc^-3)
star-forming regions. When winds are a significant contributor to the SLR
enrichment, we find that Solar system levels of enrichment can occur much
earlier (before 2.5 Myr) than when enrichment occurs from supernovae, which
start to explode at later ages (>4 Myr). We find that Solar system levels of
enrichment all but disappear in low-density star-forming regions (rho < 10Msun

representative of typical star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. The [SII]
6718, 6733 doublet is used to estimate electron densities (n_e), and
dust-corrected Ha luminosities are used to compute total ionizing photon rates

a proxy for U, we determine that galaxies with higher O32 have <n_e> ~ 500
cm^-3 that are at least a factor of ~5 larger than that of lower-O32 galaxies.
We do not find a significant difference in <Q> between low- and high-O32
galaxies. Photoionization modeling of all available strong rest-frame optical
emission lines is used to simultaneously constrain U and oxygen abundance
(Z_neb). We find a large spread in log U of ~1.5 dex at a fixed Z_neb. On the
other hand, the data indicate a highly significant correlation between U and
star-formation-rate surface density (Sigma_SFR) which appears to be redshift
invariant at z~1.6-6.3, and possibly up to z~9.5. We consider several avenues
through which metallicity and Sigma_SFR (or gas density) may influence U,
including variations in n_e and Q that are tied to metallicity and gas density,
internal dust extinction of ionizing photons, and the effects of gas density on
the volume filling fraction of dense clumps in HII regions and the escape
fraction of ionizing photons. Based on these considerations, we conclude that
gas density may play a more central role than metallicity in modulating U at
these redshifts.

establish causal relationships. However, the identifying assumptions required
by an IV design are demanding, and it remains challenging for researchers to
assess their validity. In this paper, we replicate 67 papers published in three
top journals in political science during 2010-2022 and identify several
troubling patterns. First, researchers often overestimate the strength of their
IVs due to non-i.i.d. errors, such as a clustering structure. Second, the most
commonly used t-test for the two-stage-least-squares (2SLS) estimates often
severely underestimates uncertainty. Using more robust inferential methods, we
find that around 19-30% of the 2SLS estimates in our sample are underpowered.
Third, in the majority of the replicated studies, the 2SLS estimates are much
larger than the ordinary-least-squares estimates, and their ratio is negatively
correlated with the strength of the IVs in studies where the IVs are not
experimentally generated, suggesting potential violations of unconfoundedness
or the exclusion restriction. To help researchers avoid these pitfalls, we
provide a checklist for better practice.

unimodal models, a natural question arises; do we need also to follow this
trend to tackle multimodal tasks? In this work, we propose to rather direct
effort to efficient adaptations of existing models, and propose to augment
Language Models with perception. Existing approaches for adapting pretrained
models for vision-language tasks still rely on several key components that
hinder their efficiency. In particular, they still train a large number of
parameters, rely on large multimodal pretraining, use encoders (e.g., CLIP)
trained on huge image-text datasets, and add significant inference overhead. In
addition, most of these approaches have focused on Zero-Shot and In Context
Learning, with little to no effort on direct finetuning. We investigate the
minimal computational effort needed to adapt unimodal models for multimodal
tasks and propose a new challenging setup, alongside different approaches, that
efficiently adapts unimodal pretrained models. We show that by freezing more

prepending only one trainable token, our approach (dubbed eP-ALM) significantly

simultaneously becoming harder to make sense of. Inspired by the concept of
superpixels, we propose a deep-learning based approach to segment rasterized
survey data into regions with similar characteristics. We demonstrate its use
for semi-automated geoscientific mapping with datasets arising from independent

made more difficult by the synthetic nature of these systems' outputs; since
artificial depictions of fictive humans have no inherent gender or ethnicity
nor do they belong to socially-constructed groups, we need to look beyond
common categorizations of diversity or representation. To address this need, we
propose a new method for exploring and quantifying social biases in TTI systems
by directly comparing collections of generated images designed to showcase a
system's variation across social attributes -- gender and ethnicity -- and
target attributes for bias evaluation -- professions and gender-coded
adjectives. Our approach allows us to (i) identify specific bias trends through
visualization tools, (ii) provide targeted scores to directly compare models in
terms of diversity and representation, and (iii) jointly model interdependent
social variables to support a multidimensional analysis. We use this approach
to analyze over 96,000 images generated by 3 popular TTI systems (DALL-E 2,
Stable Diffusion v 1.4 and v 2) and find that all three significantly
over-represent the portion of their latent space associated with whiteness and

finite encoding size restricts the model's representational power. Higher
representational power is needed to go from representing a single given image

representing an image with a polynomial function and eliminates the need for
positional encodings. Therefore, to achieve a progressively higher degree of

and affine-transformed coordinate locations after every ReLU layer. The
proposed method is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on large datasets

effects, i.e. events in quantum mechanics. They are partial algebras describing
the logic behind the corresponding events. It is natural to ask how to
introduce the logical connective implication in effect algebras. For
lattice-ordered effect algebras this task was already solved by several
authors, including the present ones. We concentrate on effect algebras that
need not be lattice-ordered since these can better describe the events
occurring in the quantum physical system. Although an effect algebra is only
partial, we try to find a logical connective implication which is everywhere
defined. But such a connective can be ""unsharp"" or ""inexact"" because its
outputs for given pairs of entries need not be elements of the underlying
effect algebra, but may be subsets of (mutually incomparable) maximal elements.
We introduce such an implication together with its adjoint functor representing
conjunction. Then we consider so-called tense operators on effect algebras. Of
course, also these operators turn out to be ""unsharp"" in the aforementioned
sense, but they are in a certain relation with the operators implication and
conjunction. Finally, for given tense operators and given time set T, we
describe two methods how to construct a time preference relation R on T such
that the given tense operators are either comparable with or equivalent to
those induced by the time frame (T,R).

hopping of particles between nearest neighbors. We develop a rather general
analytical framework to study the dynamics to leading order in $1/q$ on such a
lattice, allowing for arbitrary time dependent couplings, hence general
dynamical protocols. We find that the physics of the diffusive case $r>2$ is
effectively the same as the kinetic case $r=2$, assuming $r=\mathcal{O}(q^0)$.
Remarkably, we find that the local charge densities $\mathcal{Q}_i$ form a
closed set of equations. They however only show fluctuations of the order
$\mathcal{O}(\mathcal{Q}_i/q)$, hence remaining constant in the limit
$q\rightarrow \infty$. Despite this effective lack of charge dynamics, the dots
do not in fact behave as isolated lattice sites which would thermalize
instantaneously. Indeed, we show via a proof by contradiction that such
instantaneously thermalize is not generally possible for a connected lattice.
Importantly, the results are shown to be independent of the dimensionality of

image restoration that avoids the so-called ``regression to the mean'' effect
and produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based
methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,
similar to generative denoising diffusion models.
  Image restoration is an ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images
are plausible reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the
outcome of a single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all
possible explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main
advantage of InDI is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in
a single step but instead gradually improves the image in small steps,
resulting in better perceptual quality.
  While generative denoising diffusion models also work in small steps, our
formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge of any analytic
form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an iterative
restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired examples. InDI can
be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired training data. In
conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the denoising network
generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an initial image of pure
noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to conditional denoising
formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively restoring the input
low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a variety of image
restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus deblurring,
super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.

from the difference of the chemical potential of water between its source and

a domed disk shaped adherent is attached to the hygro-elastomeric film before
moisture absorption, the elastic force generated during the morphological

salinity of water increases or if it is exposed to dry air. They re-emerge when
the film is immersed in water again. Such an active response could be important

the organic phase and, subsequently. Thes emulsions invert into oil-in-water
emulsion, rather abruptly, as they cross the phase boundary. Studies based on
UV spectroscopy and molecular dynamics indicate that these processes may
involve explosive events and subsequent assembly of the fragments to other
organized structures which are reminiscent of cusp catastrophe proposed earlier
by Dickinson. These processes lead to either to a strong or a weak fluctuation

turbulence transport equations of Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver
and applied for periodic hill test case, which involves complex flow regimes,
such as attached boundary layer, shear-layer, and separation and reattachment.
The accuracy of the model is investigated in extrapolation modes, i.e., the
test case has much larger separation bubble and higher turbulence than the
training cases. A parametric study is also performed to understand the effect
of network hyperparameters on training and model accuracy and to quantify the
uncertainty in model accuracy due to the non-deterministic nature of the neural
network training. The study revealed that, for any network, less than optimal
mini-batch size results in overfitting, and larger than optimal batch size
reduces accuracy. Data clustering is found to be an efficient approach to
prevent the machine-learned model from over-training on more prevalent flow
regimes, and results in a model with similar accuracy using almost one-third of
the training dataset. Feature importance analysis reveals that turbulence
production is correlated with shear strain in the free-shear region, with shear
strain and wall-distance and local velocity-based Reynolds number in the
boundary layer regime, and with streamwise velocity gradient in the
accelerating flow regime. The flow direction is found to be key in identifying
flow separation and reattachment regime. Machine-learned models perform poorly
in extrapolation mode, wherein the prediction shows less than 10% correlation
with Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). A priori tests reveal that model
predictability improves significantly as the hill dataset is partially added
during training in a partial extrapolation model, e.g., with the addition of
only 5% of the hill data increases correlation with DNS to 80%.

cosmology and the quantum fields which propagate on it include gravitational
waves and energy density fluctuations. Many open questions seem to relate to
the fact that we very little understand this regime, where part of the
gravitational degrees of freedom, and only part of them, are quantized. In this
work we study this limit by assigning quantum properties both to the background
universe and the fluctuations and then focusing on the limit where the
background universe behaves nearly classically. The quantization is realized in
the framework of quantum general relativity through Feymann's path integrals.
We study the saddle point approximation of gravitational path integrals in the
cases of a positive and a negative cosmological constant making use of the
minisuperspace approximation focusing on the impact of different classes
boundary conditions. Our main finding is that, both for the no boundary
proposal and black holes in Euclidean anti-de Sitter space, the path integral
needs to be defined with Neumann initial conditions. The Neumann condition is
in fact necessary to recover sensible black holes thermodynamics and to
stabilize the no boundary proposal. At the same time, it can be seen, in both
cases, as a regularity requirement on the geometries entering the sum. The need
for Neumann conditions implies that the interpretation of the no boundary
wavefunction is very different from Hartle and Hawking's original intuition,
since the initial expansion rate of the universe is fixed rather than its size.
Our results for black holes stand in support of this implementation of the no
boundary proposal, where regularity is the primary requirement and allows for a
well-defined QFT in curved spacetime limit.

trained models with a massive number of parameters. In fact, several practical
studies have shown that if a pruned model is fine-tuned with some
gradient-based updates it generalizes well to new samples. Although the above
pipeline, which we refer to as pruning + fine-tuning, has been extremely
successful in lowering the complexity of trained models, there is very little
known about the theory behind this success. In this paper, we address this
issue by investigating the pruning + fine-tuning framework on the
overparameterized matrix sensing problem with the ground truth $U_\star \in
\mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$ and the overparameterized model $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d
\times k}$ with $k \gg r$. We study the approximate local minima of the mean
square error, augmented with a smooth version of a group Lasso regularizer,
$\sum_{i=1}^k \| U e_i \|_2$. In particular, we provably show that pruning all
the columns below a certain explicit $\ell_2$-norm threshold results in a
solution $U_{\text{prune}}$ which has the minimum number of columns $r$, yet
close to the ground truth in training loss. Moreover, in the subsequent
fine-tuning phase, gradient descent initialized at $U_{\text{prune}}$ converges
at a linear rate to its limit. While our analysis provides insights into the
role of regularization in pruning, we also show that running gradient descent
in the absence of regularization results in models which {are not suitable for
greedy pruning}, i.e., many columns could have their $\ell_2$ norm comparable
to that of the maximum. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the
first rigorous insights on why greedy pruning + fine-tuning leads to smaller
models which also generalize well.

spaces is a challenge that received considerable interest in recent years, with
several different approaches proposed in the literature. In general, these
methods take advantage of the exponentially growing volume of the hyperbolic
space as a function of the radius from the origin, allowing a (roughly) uniform
spatial distribution of the nodes even for scale-free small-world networks,
where the connection probability between pairs decays with hyperbolic distance.
One of the motivations behind hyperbolic embedding is that optimal placement of
the nodes in a hyperbolic space is widely thought to enable efficient
navigation on top of the network. According to that, one of the measures that
can be used to quantify the quality of different embeddings is given by the
fraction of successful greedy paths following a simple navigation protocol
based on the hyperbolic coordinates. In the present work, we develop an
optimisation scheme for this score in the native disk representation of the
hyperbolic space. This optimisation algorithm can be either used as an
embedding method alone, or it can be applied to improve this score for
embeddings obtained from other methods. According to our tests on synthetic and
real networks, the proposed optimisation can considerably enhance the success
rate of greedy paths in several cases, improving the given embedding from the
point of view of navigability.

propose a novel formulation by posing it as a planning problem in the joint

optimize the joint actions by solving a standard single-agent path planning

dimensionality in both the number of agents and the size of the graph. To
improve scalability in graph size, we further propose a hierarchical

and dual special functions in Drinfeld modules of arbitrary rank, allowing us
to define a universal special function $\omega_\phi$ and a universal dual
special function $\zeta_\phi$. In analogy to the Drinfeld-Hayes case, we prove
that the latter can be expressed as an Eisenstein-like series over the period
lattice, and that the scalar product $\omega_\phi\cdot\zeta_\phi$, an element
of $\mathbb{C}_\infty\hat\otimes\Omega$, is rational.
  We also describe the module of special functions in the generality of
Anderson modules, as already done by Gazda and Maurischat, and answer a
question posed in that same paper about the invertibility of special functions
in the context of Drinfeld-Hayes modules.

assign the poles of a system, controlled via static state feedback, at a set of
pre-specified locations. This is a classic problem in feedback control and
numerous methodologies have been proposed in the literature for cases where a
model of the system to control is available. In this paper, we study the
problem of computing feedback gains for pole placement (and, more generally,
eigenstructure assignment) directly from experimental data. Interestingly, we
show that the closed-loop poles can be placed exactly at arbitrary locations
without relying on any model description but by using only finite-length
trajectories generated by the open-loop system. In turn, these findings imply
that classical control objectives, such as feedback stabilization or meeting
transient performance specifications, can be achieved without first identifying
a system model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the benefits of the
data-driven pole-placement approach as compared to its model-based counterpart.

the success of deep learning models. However, this abundance of
public-available data also raises concerns about the unauthorized exploitation
of datasets for commercial purposes, which is forbidden by dataset licenses. In
this paper, we propose a backdoor-based watermarking approach that serves as a
general framework for safeguarding public-available data. By inserting a small
number of watermarking samples into the dataset, our approach enables the
learning model to implicitly learn a secret function set by defenders. This
hidden function can then be used as a watermark to track down third-party
models that use the dataset illegally. Unfortunately, existing backdoor
insertion methods often entail adding arbitrary and mislabeled data to the
training set, leading to a significant drop in performance and easy detection
by anomaly detection algorithms. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a
clean-label backdoor watermarking framework that uses imperceptible
perturbations to replace mislabeled samples. As a result, the watermarking
samples remain consistent with the original labels, making them difficult to
detect. Our experiments on text, image, and audio datasets demonstrate that the
proposed framework effectively safeguards datasets with minimal impact on
original task performance. We also show that adding just 1% of watermarking
samples can inject a traceable watermarking function and that our watermarking
samples are stealthy and look benign upon visual inspection.

most important challenges facing humankind. ICT (Information and Communication
Technology) is a powerful tool to reduce emissions as it offers alternatives to
activities that are costly in energy: video streaming saves energy vs driving
to a movie theater, for instance. Still, the carbon footprint of ICT in general
and networking in particular have been growing, despite better energy
efficiency per transmitted bit, due to the sheer growth in Internet usage and
traffic.
  The information and communication technology (ICT) sector is currently
estimated to create 2.7% of all global CO2 emissions and expected to continue
to increase. Hence, monitoring and reducing the CO2 emissions from ICT is
increasingly important. Networks are responsible for around 13% of ICT energy
consumption, a third of which in turn is attributable to backbone (core)
networks. As such, it is important to offer new mechanisms to reduce the energy
footprint of networks.
  In this paper, we present a framework to include energy considerations (as a
proxy for carbon footprint) into the management plane of a network. We apply
this framework to optimize the network topology so as to minimize the energy
spending while at the same time providing a satisfactory Quality of Experience
(QoE) to the end users. We present this framework along high-level

a differentiable proxy for the standard video codec, which incorporates
temporal processing with motion compensation, inter/intra mode decisions, and
in-loop filtering. We propose differentiable approximations to key video codec

significantly better rate-distortion performance compared to compressing the
original frames of the input video in two important scenarios. When
transporting high-resolution video via low-resolution HEVC, the sandwich system
obtains 6.5 dB improvements over standard HEVC. More importantly, using the
well-known perceptual similarity metric, LPIPS, we observe $~30 \%$
improvements in rate at the same quality over HEVC. Last but not least we show
that pre- and post-processors formed by very modestly-parameterized,

characterized in terms of linear matrix inequalities, we design an online
switched controller that alternates between a mode detection phase and a
stabilization phase. Since the specific currently-active mode is unknown, the
controller employs the most recent online measurements to determine it by
implementing computationally efficient tests that check compatibility with the
set of systems consistent with the pre-collected measurements. The
stabilization phase applies the stabilizing feedback gain corresponding to the
identified active mode and monitors the evolution of the associated Lyapunov
function to detect switches. When a switch is detected, the controller returns
to the mode-detection phase. Under average dwell- and activation-time

This formalism allows us to include non-periodic drives and correlated quantum

very unfavorably due to apparent clashes between ligand and protein atoms,
which lead to extremely high values of the calculated van der Waals energy

show that incorporating this machine-learned energy term into a

primordial Li, which settles to the classic Spite Plateau, with A(Li) ~2.3, by
the time the Galactic halo reaches [Fe/H] ~ -3.0. We consider three phases: (1)
first star formation in C-rich environments ([C/Fe] > 2.3), with depleted Li;
(2) silicates-dominated star formation and destruction of primordial Li during

model hijacking. The attacker can control how the object detection system
should misbehave by implanting Trojaned gradients using only a small number of
compromised clients in the collaborative learning process. This paper
introduces STDLens, a principled approach to safeguarding FL against such
attacks. We first investigate existing mitigation mechanisms and analyze their
failures caused by the inherent errors in spatial clustering analysis on
gradients. Based on the insights, we introduce a three-tier forensic framework
to identify and expel Trojaned gradients and reclaim the performance over the
course of FL. We consider three types of adaptive attacks and demonstrate the
robustness of STDLens against advanced adversaries. Extensive experiments show
that STDLens can protect FL against different model hijacking attacks and
outperform existing methods in identifying and removing Trojaned gradients with
significantly higher precision and much lower false-positive rates.

stochastically using samples $\tau^Hf(D)\tau$, where the components of the
random vectors $\tau$ obey an isotropic probability distribution. Estimating
the trace of the inverse of a discretized Dirac operator or variants thereof
have become a major challenge in lattice QCD simulations, as they represent the
disconnected contribution to certain observables. The Hutchinson Monte Carlo
sampling, however, suffers from the fact that its accuracy depends
quadratically on the sample size, making higher precision estimation very
expensive. Meyer, Musco, Musco and Woodruff recently proposed an enhancement of
Hutchinson's method, termed \texttt{Hutch++}, in which the sample space is
enriched by several vectors of the form $f(D)\zeta$, $\zeta$ a random vector as
in Hutchinson's method. Theoretical analyses show that under certain
circumstances the number of these added sample vectors can be chosen in a way
to reduce the dependence of the variance of the resulting estimator from the
number $N$ of samples from $\mathcal{O}(1/N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1/N^2)$.
  In this study we combine \texttt{Hutch++} with our recently suggested
multigrid multilevel Monte Carlo approach. We present results for the Schwinger
discretization of the $2$-di\-men\-si\-onal Dirac operator, revealing that the
two approaches contribute additively to variance reduction.

Because of the non-differentiable nature of common PnP solvers, these methods

methods have designed differentiable PnP strategies, thus imposing supervision
on the pose obtained after the PnP step. Here, we argue that this conflicts
with the averaging nature of the PnP problem, leading to gradients that may
encourage the network to degrade the accuracy of individual correspondences. To
address this, we derive a loss function that exploits the ground truth pose

specific combinations of space and time discretizations enjoy enhanced
stability properties. In fact, if the first and second-derivative upwind gSBP
operators fulfill a compatibility condition, the allowable time step size is
independent of grid refinement, although the advective terms are discretized
explicitly. In one space dimension it is shown that upwind gSBP schemes
represent a general framework including standard discontinuous Galerkin~(DG)
schemes on a global level. While previous work for DG schemes has demonstrated
that the combination of upwind advection fluxes and the central-type first
Bassi-Rebay~(BR1) scheme for diffusion does not allow for grid-independent
stable time steps, the current work shows that central advection fluxes are
compatible with BR1 regarding enhanced stability of IMEX time stepping.

efficiently allocating scarce resources. However, the computation of
equilibrium prices at which the supply of goods matches their demand typically
relies on having access to complete information on private attributes of
agents, e.g., suppliers' cost functions, which are often unavailable in
practice. Motivated by this practical consideration, we consider the problem of
setting equilibrium prices in the incomplete information setting wherein a
market operator seeks to satisfy the customer demand for a commodity by
purchasing the required amount from competing suppliers with privately known
cost functions unknown to the market operator. In this incomplete information
setting, we consider the online learning problem of learning equilibrium prices
over time while jointly optimizing three performance metrics -- unmet demand,
cost regret, and payment regret -- pertinent in the context of equilibrium
pricing over a horizon of $T$ periods. We first consider the setting when
suppliers' cost functions are fixed and develop algorithms that achieve a
regret of $O(\log \log T)$ when the customer demand is constant over time, or
$O(\sqrt{T} \log \log T)$ when the demand is variable over time. Next, we
consider the setting when the suppliers' cost functions can vary over time and
illustrate that no online algorithm can achieve sublinear regret on all three
metrics when the market operator has no information about how the cost
functions change over time. Thus, we consider an augmented setting wherein the
operator has access to hints/contexts that, without revealing the complete
specification of the cost functions, reflect the variation in the cost
functions over time and propose an algorithm with sublinear regret in this
augmented setting.

remaining challenge is a means to produce pulses with sufficient peak power to
initiate nonlinear supercontinuum generation spanning hundreds of terahertz

a simple, robust, and universal solution to this problem using off-the-shelf
polarization-maintaining (PM) amplification and nonlinear fiber components.
This fiber-integrated approach for nonlinear temporal compression and
supercontinuum generation is demonstrated with a resonant electro-optic
frequency comb at 1550 nm. We show how to readily achieve pulses shorter than
60 fs at a repetition rate of 20 GHz and with peak powers in excess of 2 kW.
The same technique can be applied to picosecond pulses at 10 GHz to demonstrate
temporal compression by a factor of 9x yielding 50 fs pulses with peak power of
5.5 kW. These compressed pulses enable flat supercontinuum generation spanning
more than 600 nm after propagation through multi-segment dispersion-tailored
anomalous-dispersion highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) or tantala waveguides. The

various algorithms, but often overlooks the fine-grained process and analysis
of trajectories. This leads to the neglect of surrounding vehicle matching, the
opaqueness of indicators definition, and reproducible crisis. To address these
gaps, this paper presents a reproducible approach to merging behavior analysis.
Specifically, we outline the causes of subjectivity and irreproducibility in
existing studies. Thereafter, we employ lanelet2 High Definition (HD) map to
construct a reproducible framework, that minimizes subjectivities, defines
standardized indicators, identifies alongside vehicles, and divides scenarios.
A comparative macroscopic and microscopic analysis is subsequently conducted.
More importantly, this paper adheres to the Reproducible Research concept,
providing all the source codes and reproduction instructions. Our results
demonstrate that although scenarios with alongside vehicles occur in less than
6% of cases, their characteristics are significantly different from others, and
these scenarios are often accompanied by high risk. This paper refines the
understanding of merging behavior, raises awareness of reproducible studies,
and serves as a watershed moment.

through simulation experiments in diverse environments using ROS1 with Gazebo.
The results show that the AGM system efficiently manages the allocated tasks

accurate trajectory prediction while considering the spatial and temporal
characteristics of the vessel. However, existing methods rarely consider the
underlying dynamics knowledge and directly use machine learning algorithms to
predict the trajectories. Intuitively, the vessel's motions are following the
laws of dynamics, e.g., the speed of a vessel decreases when turning a corner.
Yet, it is challenging to combine dynamic knowledge and neural networks due to
their inherent heterogeneity. Against this background, we propose MSTFormer, a
motion inspired vessel trajectory prediction method based on Transformer. The
contribution of this work is threefold. First, we design a data augmentation
method to describe the spatial features and motion features of the trajectory.
Second, we propose a Multi-headed Dynamic-aware Self-attention mechanism to
focus on trajectory points with frequent motion transformations. Finally, we
construct a knowledge-inspired loss function to further boost the performance
of the model. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our
strategy not only effectively improves long-term predictive capability but also
outperforms backbones on cornering data.The ablation analysis further confirms
the efficacy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, MSTFormer is
the first neural network model for trajectory prediction fused with vessel
motion dynamics, providing a worthwhile direction for future research.The

to enable end-to-end communications processes, and recent studies have shown

multiple access in semantic communication, we propose a deep learning-based
multiple access (DeepMA) method by training semantic communication models with
the abilities of joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and orthogonal signal
modulation. DeepMA is achieved by a DeepMA network (DMANet), which is comprised
of several independent encoder-decoder pairs (EDPs), and the DeepMA encoders
can encode the input data as mutually orthogonal semantic symbol vectors (SSVs)
such that the DeepMA decoders can recover their own target data from a received
mixed SSV (MSSV) superposed by multiple SSV components transmitted from
different encoders. We describe frameworks of DeepMA in wireless

DeepMA in wireless image transmission tasks and compare its performance with
the attention module-based deep JSCC (ADJSCC) method and conventional

  Disks","29pages, 13figures, accepted for ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The faint CO gases in debris disks are easily dissolved into C by UV
irradiation, while CO can be reformed via reactions with hydrogen. The
abundance ratio of C/CO could thus be a probe of the amount of hydrogen in the
debris disks. We conduct radiative transfer calculations with chemical
reactions for debris disks. For a typical dust-to-gas mass ratio of debris
disks, CO formation proceeds without the involvement of H$_2$ because a small
amount of dust grains makes H$_2$ formation inefficient. We find that the CO to
C number density ratio depends on a combination of
$n_\mathrm{H}Z^{0.4}\chi^{-1.1}$, where $n_\mathrm{H}$ is the hydrogen nucleus
number density, $Z$ is the metallicity, and $\chi$ is the FUV flux normalized
by the Habing flux. Using an analytic formula for the CO number density, we
give constraints on the amount of hydrogen and metallicity for debris disks. CO
formation is accelerated by excited H$_2$ either when the dust-to-gas mass
ratio is increased or the energy barrier of chemisorption of hydrogen on the
dust surface is decreased. This acceleration of CO formation occurs only when
the shielding effects of CO are insignificant. In shielded regions, the CO
fractions are almost independent of the parameters of dust grains.

source domain often struggle to generalize to unseen target domains, i.e., a
domain gap problem. Texture often contributes to the domain gap, making DNNs
vulnerable to domain shift because they are prone to be texture-biased.
Existing Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) methods have
alleviated the domain gap problem by guiding models to prioritize shape over
texture. On the other hand, shape and texture are two prominent and
complementary cues in semantic segmentation. This paper argues that leveraging
texture is crucial for improving performance in DGSS. Specifically, we propose
a novel framework, coined Texture Learning Domain Randomization (TLDR). TLDR
includes two novel losses to effectively enhance texture learning in DGSS: (1)
a texture regularization loss to prevent overfitting to source domain textures
by using texture features from an ImageNet pre-trained model and (2) a texture
generalization loss that utilizes random style images to learn diverse texture
representations in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TLDR; e.g., TLDR achieves 46.5 mIoU

self-limiting perspective that appropriates cognitive bandwidth required for
essential processes like learning in favour of addressing more critical needs
or perceived insufficiencies. Through a multi-disciplinary literature analysis
of ideas in cognitive science, learning theories and mindsets, and current
technology approaches that are suited to address the limitations of scarcity

activities and the context priming are transferable to virtual reality
environments. As such, building on our multidisciplinary research insights, we
propose a comprehensive priming model that exploits priming techniques in an

strategies can focus on student preparation, motivation, reflection, the

pilot tone scheme, one of the pilot tones is used for estimating the
polarization rotation angle, and the other one is used for compensating the
polarization perturbation introduced phase noise. Meanwhile, residual effects
are compensated precisely with the help of a real-valued FIR filter. In this
case, the excess noise introduced by polarization perturbation is effectively
suppressed. Experimental results show that the polarization scrambling rate
12.57 krad/s can be tracked by using the proposed algorithm, and a good

polarization tracking performance is evaluated by digital simulations, and the
simulation results show that about 188.50 Mrad/s can be tracked by the proposed

  Abstraction","Accepted to CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a novel, abstraction-based, certified training method for
robust image classifiers. Via abstraction, all perturbed images are mapped into
intervals before feeding into neural networks for training. By training on
intervals, all the perturbed images that are mapped to the same interval are
classified as the same label, rendering the variance of training sets to be
small and the loss landscape of the models to be smooth. Consequently, our
approach significantly improves the robustness of trained models. For the
abstraction, our training method also enables a sound and complete black-box
verification approach, which is orthogonal and scalable to arbitrary types of
neural networks regardless of their sizes and architectures. We evaluate our
method on a wide range of benchmarks in different scales. The experimental
results show that our method outperforms state of the art by (i) reducing the
verified errors of trained models up to 95.64%; (ii) totally achieving up to
602.50x speedup; and (iii) scaling up to larger models with up to 138 million

the weight of robustness. Moreover, at the later stage, we let DNNs put more

the performance is reduced by nonuniform devices. In biological brains,
information is usually encoded by a cluster of neurons such that the

neuromorphic computing and demonstrate that this strategy can overcome the
problems caused by nonuniform devices. Using magnetic memristor device based on
current-induced domain-wall motion as an example, we show that imperfect
storage devices can be applied in a hardware network to perform principal

Beliefs, desires, and intentions are the early abilities of infants and the
foundation of human cognitive ability, as well as for machine with ToM. In this
paper, we review recent progress in machine ToM on beliefs, desires, and
intentions. And we shall introduce the experiments, datasets and methods of
machine ToM on these three aspects, summarize the development of different
tasks and datasets in recent years, and compare well-behaved models in aspects
of advantages, limitations and applicable conditions, hoping that this study
can guide researchers to quickly keep up with latest trend in this field.
Unlike other domains with a specific task and resolution framework, machine ToM
lacks a unified instruction and a series of standard evaluation tasks, which
make it difficult to formally compare the proposed models. We argue that, one
method to address this difficulty is now to present a standard assessment
criteria and dataset, better a large-scale dataset covered multiple aspects of
ToM.

issue of evaluating the security of passport-based IP protection methods. We
propose a novel and effective ambiguity attack against passport-based method,
capable of successfully forging multiple valid passports with a small training
dataset. This is accomplished by inserting a specially designed accessory block
ahead of the passport parameters. Using less than 10% of training data, with
the forged passport, the model exhibits almost indistinguishable performance
difference (less than 2%) compared with that of the authorized passport. In
addition, it is shown that our attack strategy can be readily generalized to
attack other IP protection methods based on watermark embedding. Directions for
potential remedy solutions are also given.

weak pinning at low temperatures to strong pinning at high temperatures. The
microstructure study for sample S2 reveals some expanded Ca$_2$F$_2$ layers and
dislocation defects in RbFe$_2$As$_2$ layers. The normalized magnetic
relaxation results indicate that the SMP is strongly associated with the

gradually evolves into a step-like shape and then becomes a sharp peak near the
irreversibility field similar to what is usually observed in low-temperature

coding theory has indicated that independent encoding and joint decoding with
side information (SI) can achieve high-efficient compression of correlated
sources. This has inspired a distributed coding architecture aiming at reducing
the encoding complexity. However, traditional distributed coding methods suffer
from a substantial performance gap to predictive coding ones. Inspired by the
great success of learning-based compression, we propose the first end-to-end
distributed deep video compression framework to improve the rate-distortion
performance. A key ingredient is an effective SI generation module at the
decoder, which helps to effectively exploit inter-frame correlations without
computation-intensive encoder-side motion estimation and compensation.
Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms conventional
distributed video coding and H.264. Meanwhile, it enjoys 6-7x encoding speedup
against DVC [1] with comparable compression performance. Code is released at

YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) using an ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD)

phonon dispersion indicated that decoupling between thermal phenomena and
electron transport at low temperatures leads to layer-by-layer thermal
decoupling in YBCO. Electronically and thermally isolated Ba atoms in YBCO are
responsible for the thermal decoupling. The analytic study of the thermal
dcoupling revealed that Planckian dissipation expressing linear-T resistivity

discretization, the marker and cell (MAC) difference method is applied, which
evaluates the velocity components, the pressure and the phase variable at
different cell locations. Such an approach ensures the divergence-free feature
of the discrete velocity, and this property plays an important role in the
analysis. The positivity-preserving property and the unique solvability of the
proposed numerical scheme are theoretically justified, utilizing the singular
nature of the logarithmic term as the phase variable approaches the singular
limit values. An unconditional energy stability analysis is standard, as an
outcome of the convex-concave decomposition technique. A convergence analysis
with accompanying error estimate is provided for the proposed numerical scheme.
In particular, a higher order consistency analysis, accomplished by

fragmentation and star formation, but are very difficult to detect. The
temporal correlation between the field strength (B) and gas density (n) of an
isolated cloud has been suggested as an indication of the dynamical importance
of B-fields relative to self-gravity. This temporal B-n relation is, however,
unobservable. What can be observed using Zeeman measurements are the ""spatial
B-n relations"" from the current plane of the sky. Nevertheless, the temporal
B-n relation argument has still been widely used to interpret observations.
Here we present the first numerical test of the legitimacy of this
interpretation. From a simulation that can reproduce the observed Zeeman
spatial B~n^2/3 relation, we found that temporal B-n relations of individual
cores bear no resemblance to the spatial B-n relations. This result inspired us
to discover that the true mechanism behind the 2/3 index is random turbulence
compression instead of symmetrical gravitational contraction.

predict separation lines from table images directly. Compared to Vallina DETR,
we propose three improvements in DQ-DETR to make the two-stage DETR framework
work efficiently and effectively for the separation line prediction task: 1) A
new query design, named Dynamic Query, to decouple single line query into
separable point queries which could intuitively improve the localization
accuracy for regression tasks; 2) A dynamic queries based progressive line
regression approach to progressively regressing points on the line which
further enhances localization accuracy for distorted tables; 3) A
prior-enhanced matching strategy to solve the slow convergence issue of DETR.
After separation line prediction, a simple relation network based cell merging
module is used to recover spanning cells. With these new techniques, our
TSRFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets,

owing to its holistic sensing of a scene. Recently, some methods, \eg,
OmniFusion, have applied the tangent projection (TP) to represent a
360{\deg}image and predicted depth values via patch-wise regressions, which are
merged to get a depth map with equirectangular projection (ERP) format.
However, these methods suffer from 1) non-trivial process of merging plenty of
patches; 2) capturing less holistic-with-regional contextual information by
directly regressing the depth value of each pixel. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework, \textbf{HRDFuse}, that subtly combines the potential of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers by collaboratively
learning the \textit{holistic} contextual information from the ERP and the
\textit{regional} structural information from the TP. Firstly, we propose a
spatial feature alignment (\textbf{SFA}) module that learns feature
similarities between the TP and ERP to aggregate the TP features into a
complete ERP feature map in a pixel-wise manner. Secondly, we propose a
collaborative depth distribution classification (\textbf{CDDC}) module that
learns the \textbf{holistic-with-regional} histograms capturing the ERP and TP
depth distributions. As such, the final depth values can be predicted as a
linear combination of histogram bin centers. Lastly, we adaptively combine the
depth predictions from ERP and TP to obtain the final depth map. Extensive
experiments show that our method predicts\textbf{ more smooth and accurate
depth} results while achieving \textbf{favorably better} results than the SOTA

emerged as alternatives to traditional partial differential equation (PDE)
solvers, but little literature has focused on devising accurate numerical
integration methods for neural networks (NNs), which is essential for getting
accurate solutions. In this work, we propose adaptive quadratures for the
accurate integration of neural networks and apply them to loss functions
appearing in low-dimensional PDE discretisations. We show that at opposite ends
of the spectrum, continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) activation functions enable
one to bound the integration error, while smooth activations ease the
convergence of the optimisation problem. We strike a balance by considering a
CPWL approximation of a smooth activation function. The CPWL activation is used
to obtain an adaptive decomposition of the domain into regions where the
network is almost linear, and we derive an adaptive global quadrature from this
mesh. The loss function is then obtained by evaluating the smooth network
(together with other quantities, e.g., the forcing term) at the quadrature
points. We propose a method to approximate a class of smooth activations by
CPWL functions and show that it has a quadratic convergence rate. We then
derive an upper bound for the overall integration error of our proposed
adaptive quadrature. The benefits of our quadrature are evaluated on a strong
and weak formulation of the Poisson equation in dimensions one and two. Our
numerical experiments suggest that compared to Monte-Carlo integration, our
adaptive quadrature makes the convergence of NNs quicker and more robust to
parameter initialisation while needing significantly fewer integration points
and keeping similar training times.

strategy to incorporate intermediate motion information underlying the temporal

mainstream literature where the efficacy of strong backbones and effective
decoder heads has been well studied, in this paper, additional contextual hints
are instead exploited via learning a context-aware classifier whose content is
data-conditioned, decently adapting to different latent distributions. Since
only the classifier is dynamically altered, our method is model-agnostic and
can be easily applied to generic segmentation models. Notably, with only
negligible additional parameters and +2\% inference time, decent performance
gain has been achieved on both small and large models with challenging
benchmarks, manifesting substantial practical merits brought by our simple yet
effective method. The implementation is available at

vision tasks due to its wide applications and extreme complexities of
in-the-wild scenarios. Existing arts can be mainly divided into two threads: 1)
RGB-dependent methods restore information using degraded RGB inputs only (\eg,
low-light enhancement), 2) RGB-independent methods translate images captured
under auxiliary near-infrared (NIR) illuminants into RGB domain (\eg, NIR2RGB
translation). The latter is very attractive since it works in complete darkness
and the illuminants are visually friendly to naked eyes, but tends to be
unstable due to its intrinsic ambiguities. In this paper, we try to robustify
NIR2RGB translation by designing the optimal spectrum of auxiliary illumination
in the wide-band VIS-NIR range, while keeping visual friendliness. Our core
idea is to quantify the visibility constraint implied by the human vision

process of images in the VIS-NIR range, the optimal multiplexing of a wide

surroundings, such as EEG data to examine alterations in brain activity or
sensors to monitor body movements. Segmentation of multivariate time series
data is a technique for identifying meaningful patterns or changes in the time
series that can signal a shift in the system's behavior. However, most
segmentation algorithms have been designed primarily for univariate time
series, and their performance on multivariate data remains largely
unsatisfactory, making this a challenging problem. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach for multivariate time series segmentation using conditional
independence (CI) graphs. CI graphs are probabilistic graphical models that
represents the partial correlations between the nodes. We propose a domain
agnostic multivariate segmentation framework `$\texttt{tGLAD}$' which draws a
parallel between the CI graph nodes and the variables of the time series.
Consider applying a graph recovery model $\texttt{uGLAD}$ to a short interval
of the time series, it will result in a CI graph that shows partial
correlations among the variables. We extend this idea to the entire time series
by utilizing a sliding window to create a batch of time intervals and then run
a single $\texttt{uGLAD}$ model in multitask learning mode to recover all the
CI graphs simultaneously. As a result, we obtain a corresponding temporal CI
graphs representation. We then designed a first-order and second-order based
trajectory tracking algorithms to study the evolution of these graphs across
distinct intervals. Finally, an `Allocation' algorithm is used to determine a
suitable segmentation of the temporal graph sequence. $\texttt{tGLAD}$ provides
a competitive time complexity of $O(N)$ for settings where number of variables
$D<<N$. We demonstrate successful empirical results on a Physical Activity

pre-requisite to discover an entity, e.g. a book, with a search engine is that
the entity is retrievable, i.e. there are queries for which the system will
surface such entity in the top results. However, machine-learned search engines
have a high retrievability bias, where the majority of the queries return the
same entities. This happens partly due to the predominance of narrow intent
queries, where users create queries using the title of an already known entity,
e.g. in book search 'harry potter'. The amount of broad queries where users
want to discover new entities, e.g. in music search 'chill lyrical electronica
with an atmospheric feeling to it', and have a higher tolerance to what they
might find, is small in comparison. We focus here on two factors that have a
negative impact on the retrievability of the entities (I) the training data
used for dense retrieval models and (II) the distribution of narrow and broad
intent queries issued in the system. We propose CtrlQGen, a method that
generates queries for a chosen underlying intent-narrow or broad. We can use
CtrlQGen to improve factor (I) by generating training data for dense retrieval
models comprised of diverse synthetic queries. CtrlQGen can also be used to
deal with factor (II) by suggesting queries with broader intents to users. Our
results on datasets from the domains of music, podcasts, and books reveal that
we can significantly decrease the retrievability bias of a dense retrieval
model when using CtrlQGen. First, by using the generated queries as training
data for dense models we make 9% of the entities retrievable (go from zero to
non-zero retrievability). Second, by suggesting broader queries to users, we
can make 12% of the entities retrievable in the best case.

proposes the CoopInit, a simple yet effective cooperative learning-based
initialization strategy that can quickly learn a good starting point for GANs,
with a very small computation overhead during training. The proposed algorithm
consists of two learning stages: (i) Cooperative initialization stage: The
discriminator of GAN is treated as an energy-based model (EBM) and is optimized
via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), with the help of the GAN's generator
to provide synthetic data to approximate the learning gradients. The EBM also
guides the MLE learning of the generator via MCMC teaching; (ii) Adversarial
finalization stage: After a few iterations of initialization, the algorithm
seamlessly transits to the regular mini-max adversarial training until
convergence. The motivation is that the MLE-based initialization stage drives
the model towards mode coverage, which is helpful in alleviating the issue of
mode dropping during the adversarial learning stage. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach on image generation and one-sided
unpaired image-to-image translation tasks through extensive experiments.

introduced and studied in a previous paper for general first-order structures,
to make it expressible in the language of set theory. The adopted definition of
the class ${\rm NT}$ of nontypical sets comes out as a natural strengthening of
Russell's initial definition, which employs properties of small (minority)
extensions, when the latter are restricted to the various levels $V_\zeta$ of
$V$. This strengthening leads to defining ${\rm NT}$ as the class of sets that
belong to some countable ordinal definable set. It follows that ${\rm
OD}\subseteq {\rm NT}$ and hence ${\rm HOD}\subseteq {\rm HNT}$. It is proved
that the class ${\rm HNT}$ of hereditarily nontypical sets is an inner model of
${\rm ZF}$. Moreover the (relative) consistency of $V\neq {\rm NT}$ is
established, by showing that in many forcing extensions $M[G]$ the generic set
$G$ is a typical element of $M[G]$, a fact which is fully in accord with the
intuitive meaning of typicality. In particular it is consistent that there
exist continuum many typical reals. In addition it follows from a result of
Kanovei and Lyubetsky that ${\rm HOD}\neq {\rm HNT}$ is also relatively
consistent. In particular it is consistent that ${\cal P}(\omega)\cap {\rm
OD}\subsetneq{\cal P}(\omega)\cap {\rm NT}$. However many questions remain
open, among them the consistency of ${\rm HOD}\neq {\rm HNT}\neq V$, ${\rm
HOD}={\rm HNT}\neq V$ and ${\rm HOD}\neq {\rm HNT}= V$.

to the band-limited and noisy nature of seismic data. This comes with
additional challenges for 4D applications, given inaccuracies in the
repeatability of the time-lapse acquisition surveys. Consequently, adding prior
information to the inversion process in the form of properly crafted
regularization terms is essential to obtain geologically meaningful subsurface

propose a joint inversion-segmentation algorithm for 4D seismic inversion,
which integrates Total-Variation and segmentation priors as a way to counteract
the missing frequencies and noise present in 4D seismic data. The proposed
inversion framework is applied to a pair of surveys from the open Sleipner 4D

similarities between multiple data, it mitigates the non-repeatable noise and
better highlights the real time-lapse changes, and 3. it provides a volumetric

Furthermore, we add a certain fraction of the energy of accreted material into
the stellar interior as additional heat and combine the resulting effects on
stellar evolution with the stellar spin model. For different combinations of
parameters, stellar periods at an age of 1~Myr range between 0.6~days and
12.9~days. Thus, during the relatively short time period of 1~Myr, a
significant amount of stellar angular momentum can already be removed by the
interaction between the star and its accretion disk. The amount of additional
heat added into the stellar interior, the accretion history, and the presence
of disk and stellar winds have the strongest impact on the stellar spin
evolution during the first million years. The slowest stellar rotations result
from a combination of strong magnetic fields, a large amount of additional
heat, and effective winds. The fastest rotators combine weak magnetic fields
and ineffective winds or result from a small amount of additional heat added to
the star. Scenarios that could lead to such configurations are discussed.
Different initial rotation periods of the stellar seed, on the other hand,
quickly converges and do not affect the stellar period at all. Our model
matches up to 90\% of the observed rotation periods in six young ($\lesssim

unseen target domains utilizing multiple source domains without re-training.
Most existing DG works are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
However, the local operation of the convolution kernel makes the model focus
too much on local representations (e.g., texture), which inherently causes the
model more prone to overfit to the source domains and hampers its
generalization ability. Recently, several MLP-based methods have achieved
promising results in supervised learning tasks by learning global interactions
among different patches of the image. Inspired by this, in this paper, we first
analyze the difference between CNN and MLP methods in DG and find that MLP
methods exhibit a better generalization ability because they can better capture
the global representations (e.g., structure) than CNN methods. Then, based on a
recent lightweight MLP method, we obtain a strong baseline that outperforms
most state-of-the-art CNN-based methods. The baseline can learn global
structure representations with a filter to suppress structure irrelevant
information in the frequency space. Moreover, we propose a dynAmic
LOw-Frequency spectrum Transform (ALOFT) that can perturb local texture
features while preserving global structure features, thus enabling the filter
to remove structure-irrelevant information sufficiently. Extensive experiments

first extracts features of both the body and part regions using an
attention-guided mechanism. We then utilize these features to encode extra
part-body dependency for per-part regression, with part features as queries and
body feature as a reference. This allows our network to infer the spatial
relationship of occluded parts with the body by leveraging visible parts and
body reference information. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods on two benchmark datasets, and our experiments show that it
significantly surpasses existing methods in terms of depth ambiguity and

segmentation and analysis of cardiac magnetic resonance images to provide
core-lab processing for a multi-centre registry of Fontan patients.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study used training (n = 175),
validation (n = 25) and testing (n = 50) cardiac magnetic resonance image exams
collected from 13 institutions in the UK, US and Canada. The data was used to
train and evaluate a pipeline containing three deep-learning models. The
pipeline's performance was assessed on the Dice and IoU score between the
automated and reference standard manual segmentation. Cardiac function values
were calculated from both the automated and manual segmentation and evaluated
using Bland-Altman analysis and paired t-tests. The overall pipeline was
further evaluated qualitatively on 475 unseen patient exams.
  Results: For the 50 testing dataset, the pipeline achieved a median Dice
score of 0.91 (0.89-0.94) for end-diastolic volume, 0.86 (0.82-0.89) for
end-systolic volume, and 0.74 (0.70-0.77) for myocardial mass. The deep
learning-derived end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, myocardial mass,
stroke volume and ejection fraction had no statistical difference compared to
the same values derived from manual segmentation with p values all greater than
0.05. For the 475 unseen patient exams, the pipeline achieved 68% adequate
segmentation in both systole and diastole, 26% needed minor adjustments in
either systole or diastole, 5% needed major adjustments, and the cropping model
only failed in 0.4%.
  Conclusion: Deep learning pipeline can provide standardised 'core-lab'
segmentation for Fontan patients. This pipeline can now be applied to the >4500
cardiac magnetic resonance exams currently in the FORCE registry as well as any
new patients that are recruited.

  annotation campaigns","CVPR23",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Annotating new datasets for machine learning tasks is tedious,
time-consuming, and costly. For segmentation applications, the burden is
particularly high as manual delineations of relevant image content are often
extremely expensive or can only be done by experts with domain-specific
knowledge. Thanks to developments in transfer learning and training with weak
supervision, segmentation models can now also greatly benefit from annotations
of different kinds. However, for any new domain application looking to use weak
supervision, the dataset builder still needs to define a strategy to distribute
full segmentation and other weak annotations. Doing so is challenging, however,
as it is a priori unknown how to distribute an annotation budget for a given
new dataset. To this end, we propose a novel approach to determine annotation
strategies for segmentation datasets, whereby estimating what proportion of
segmentation and classification annotations should be collected given a fixed
budget. To do so, our method sequentially determines proportions of
segmentation and classification annotations to collect for budget-fractions by
modeling the expected improvement of the final segmentation model. We show in
our experiments that our approach yields annotations that perform very close to
the optimal for a number of different annotation budgets and datasets.

it is possible to automatically obtain accurate semantic masks of synthetic

potential of the cross-attention map between text and image, which is natural

generation. DiffuMask uses text-guided cross-attention information to localize
class/word-specific regions, which are combined with practical techniques to

methods help to reduce data collection and annotation costs obviously.
Experiments demonstrate that the existing segmentation methods trained on

accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and
clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab
initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or
lower levels of theory (e.g. DFT). Transfer learning, which improves a global
PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient
alternative requiring only a fraction of the high level data (on the order of
100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). The present work
demonstrates that even with Hartree-Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as
the lower level model, transfer learning yields CCSD(T)-level quality for
H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies and H-transfer tunneling
splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations
on the sub-microsecond time scale in the gas phase are possible and the
infrared spectra determined from the transfer learned PESs are in good
agreement with experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic

weighting into parametric modeling to represent spatially varying specular

reconstruct the reflectance parameters from non-Light Stage data, which are
used to train an initial morphable reflectance model. To enhance the model's
generalization capability and expressive power, we further propose an

forthcoming 5G in many devices, the question about the assessment of the
exposure in wearable typical usage to millimeter waves is crucial and timely.
For such frequencies, the power absorption becomes strongly superficial and
involves only the most superficial tissue of the human body, i.e., the skin. In
literature there are some models able to describe the layered structure of the
skin but, until now, there is no literature consensus on the skin model to
employ in computational exposure assessment studies. For these reasons, the
present work aimed to simulate four different models of the most superficial
tissues with different degree of detail exposed to two wearable patch antennas
at different frequencies i.e., 28 GHz and 39 GHz. This allows to investigate
the impact that the choice of a layered model rather than the homogeneous one
has on the exposure. Simulations were performed through the FDTD method,
implemented in the Sim4life platform and the exposure was assessed with the
absorbed power density averaged over 1 cm2 and 4 cm2 (Sab). The data showed
that the homogeneous model underestimates the peak value of Sab obtained for
multi-layer models in the stratum corneum (by 14% to 21% depending on the
number of layers of the model and the frequency). This finding was confirmed by
an analytical approach with two impinging plane wave TEM-polarized with normal
incidence at 28 GHz and 39 GHz respectively. Conversely, there are no
substantial differences in the exposure levels between the layered models

from logical label. Existing LE approach have the following problems:
(\textbf{i}) They use logical label to train mappings to LD, but the
supervision information is too loose, which can lead to inaccurate model
prediction; (\textbf{ii}) They ignore feature redundancy and use the collected

space to generate more accurate label-confidence. To solve (\textbf{ii}), we
proposed a novel supervised LE dimensionality reduction approach, which
projects the original data into a lower dimensional feature space. Combining
the above two, we obtain the augmented data for LE. Further, we proposed a
novel nonlinear LE model based on the label-confidence and reduced features.

attention recently. Among these, continual graph learning is widely regarded as
a promising approach for the streaming recommendation by academia and industry.
However, existing methods either rely on the historical data replay which is
often not practical under increasingly strict data regulations, or can seldom

to find the best time steps to transmit so that the influence of this vertex is
maximized. We frame this problem as a spreading process that follows a variant
of the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model and we focus on four
objective functions. In the MaxSpread objective, the goal is to maximize the
total number of vertices that get infected at least once. In the MaxViral
objective, the goal is to maximize the number of vertices that are infected at

MinNonViralTime, the goal is to maximize the total number of vertices that get

unconstrained setting where the source can transmit whenever it wants; (2) the
window-constrained setting where the source has to transmit at either a
predetermined, or a shifting window; (3) the periodic setting where the
temporal graph has a small period. We prove that all of these problems, with

Extensions to multiclass problems have also been made, which consist of an

called Quantum Multiclass SVM (QMSVM). The multiclass classification problem is

Experiments have been performed on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer for a

despite the memory demands of the quantum annealer, QMSVM can achieve accuracy
that is comparable to standard SVM methods and, more importantly, it scales
much more efficiently with the number of training examples, resulting in nearly
constant time. This work shows an approach for bringing together classical and

non-redundant explanations and MUSs. However, MUS extraction algorithms do not
provide any guarantee of subset minimality or optimality with respect to a

  Series with Constrained Reinforcement Learning","9 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI q-fin.RM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In high-dimensional time-series analysis, it is essential to have a set of
key factors (namely, the style factors) that explain the change of the observed
variable. For example, volatility modeling in finance relies on a set of risk
factors, and climate change studies in climatology rely on a set of causal
factors. The ideal low-dimensional style factors should balance significance
(with high explanatory power) and stability (consistent, no significant
fluctuations). However, previous supervised and unsupervised feature extraction
methods can hardly address the tradeoff. In this paper, we propose Style Miner,
a reinforcement learning method to generate style factors. We first formulate
the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process with explanatory power as
the return and stability as the constraint. Then, we design fine-grained
immediate rewards and costs and use a Lagrangian heuristic to balance them
adaptively. Experiments on real-world financial data sets show that Style Miner
outperforms existing learning-based methods by a large margin and achieves a
relatively 10% gain in R-squared explanatory power compared to the
industry-renowned factors proposed by human experts.

made headlines everywhere because of its ability to analyze and create text,
images, and beyond. With such overwhelming media coverage, it is almost
impossible for us to miss the opportunity to glimpse AIGC from a certain angle.
In the era of AI transitioning from pure analysis to creation, it is worth
noting that ChatGPT, with its most recent language model GPT-4, is just a tool
out of numerous AIGC tasks. Impressed by the capability of the ChatGPT, many
people are wondering about its limits: can GPT-5 (or other future GPT variants)
help ChatGPT unify all AIGC tasks for diversified content creation? Toward
answering this question, a comprehensive review of existing AIGC tasks is
needed. As such, our work comes to fill this gap promptly by offering a first
look at AIGC, ranging from its techniques to applications. Modern generative AI
relies on various technical foundations, ranging from model architecture and
self-supervised pretraining to generative modeling methods (like GAN and
diffusion models). After introducing the fundamental techniques, this work
focuses on the technological development of various AIGC tasks based on their
output type, including text, images, videos, 3D content, etc., which depicts
the full potential of ChatGPT's future. Moreover, we summarize their
significant applications in some mainstream industries, such as education and
creativity content. Finally, we discuss the challenges currently faced and
present an outlook on how generative AI might evolve in the near future.

annealing up to 11 mT when using substrates with anisotropic surfaces. They can

been popular in settings where the treatment status is completely described by

problem is usually reduced to a univariate one where using local linear
regressions is suitable. Instead, we propose a forest-based estimator that can
flexibly model multivariate scores, where we build two honest forests in the
sense of Wager and Athey (2018) on both sides of the treatment boundary. This
estimator is asymptotically normal and sidesteps the pitfalls of running local
linear regressions in higher dimensions. In simulations, we find our proposed
estimator outperforms local linear regressions in multivariate designs and is
competitive against the minimax-optimal estimator of Imbens and Wager (2019).
The implementation of this estimator is simple, can readily accommodate any

Galactic Nuclei (AGN) which have weak emission in other wavelengths. Data from
the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard JWST provides an excellent
opportunity to perform such studies. We take advantage of the MIRI imaging data
from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) to investigate
the AGN population in the distant universe. We estimate the source properties
of MIRI-selected objects by utilizing spectral energy distribution (SED)
modelling, and classify them into star-forming galaxies (SF), SF-AGN mixed
objects, and AGN. The source numbers of these types are 418, 111, and 31,
respectively, from 4 MIRI pointings covering $\sim 9$ arcmin$^2$. The sample
spans a redshift range of $\approx 0$--5. We derive the median SEDs for all
three source types, respectively, and publicly release them. The median MIRI
SED of AGN is similar to the typical SEDs of hot dust-obscured galaxies and
Seyfert 2s, for which the mid-IR SEDs are dominantly from AGN-heated hot dust.
Based on our SED-fit results, we estimate the black-hole accretion density
(BHAD; i.e., total BH growth rate per comoving volume) as a function of
redshift. At $z<3$, the resulting BHAD agrees with the X-ray measurements in
general. At $z>3$, we identify a total of 27 AGN and SF-AGN mixed objects,
leading to that our high-$z$ BHAD is substantially higher than the X-ray
results ($\sim 0.5$ dex at $z \approx 3$--5). This difference indicates MIRI
can identify a large population of heavily obscured AGN missed by X-ray surveys
at high redshifts.

preflare flux rope in a stratified, 3D MHD simulation. One puzzle is that this
modelled flux rope does not form by the usual mechanisms at work in larger
flares such as flux emergence, flux cancellation, or tether-cutting. Using
Lagrangian markers to trace representative field lines, we follow the
spatiotemporal evolution of the flux rope. We isolate flux bundles associated
with reconnecting field line pairs by focusing on thin current sheets within
the flux system. We also analyze the time-varying distribution of the
force-free parameter as the rope relaxes. Lastly, we compare different seeding
methods for magnetic fields and discuss their relevance. We show that the
modeled flux rope is gradually built from coalescing, current-carrying flux
tubes. This occurs through a series of component reconnections that are driven
by flows in the underlying convection zone. These reconnections lead to an
inverse cascade of helicity from small to larger scales. We also find that the
system attempts to relax toward a linear force-free field, but that the
convective drivers and eventual nanoflare prevent full relaxation. Using a
self-consistently driven simulation of a nanoflare event, we show for the first
time an inverse helicity cascade tending toward a Taylor relaxation in the
Sun's corona, resulting in a well-ordered flux rope that later reconnects with
surrounding fields. This provides clues toward understanding the buildup of
nanoflare events in the quiet Sun through incomplete Taylor relaxations when no
flux emergence or cancellation is observed.

both local and global information. Furthermore, the model integrates

effectively react to environmental changes. This can require maneuvering on
varying surfaces which is still a difficult problem, especially for slippery
terrains. To address this issue we propose a new approach that learns a
surface-aware dynamics model by conditioning it on a latent variable vector
storing surface information about the current location. A latent mapper is
trained to update these latent variables during inference from multiple
modalities on every traversal of the corresponding locations and stores them in
a map. By training everything end-to-end with the loss of the dynamics model,
we enforce the latent mapper to learn an update rule for the latent map that is
useful for the subsequent dynamics model. We implement and evaluate our
approach on a real miniature electric car. The results show that the latent map
is updated to allow more accurate predictions of the dynamics model compared to
a model without this information. We further show that by using this model, the
driving performance can be improved on varying and challenging surfaces.

models are coupled in sequence via direct photon hopping and investigate the
stability of a recently found frustrated superradiant phase and the associated
two critical scalings [Phys.\~Rev.\~Lett. 128, 163601] in the presence of two
symmetry-breaking perturbations. The first type of perturbation breaks
time-reversal symmetry by synthesizing an artificial gauge field in the cavity
and is manifested in the phase of the photon hopping amplitude. We find that
this type of perturbation demolishes the two critical scalings but allows the
emergence of a new scaling behavior with unconventional exponent $1.5$ in the
frustrated superradiant phase and finite critical fluctuations when approaching
the critical point from the normal phase. Remarkably, the two critical scalings
appear again at a tricritical point in both the normal phase and superradiant
phase. The second type of perturbation comes from tuning the anisotropy of the
Dicke model, such that in the isotropic case the $Z_2$ parity symmetry of the
Dicke model turns into a $U(1)$ continuous symmetry of the Tavis-Cummings
model. We find the emergence of a zero-energy mode in the superradiant phase
which can be attributed to a phase redundancy of the ground state solutions in
the isotropic model.

help of multiple RISs. For indoor environment, various obstacles such as
pillars, walls, and other objects can result in no line-of-sight signal path
between the BS and a user, which can significantly degrade performance. To
overcome such limitation of indoor THz communication, we firstly optimize the
placement of RISs to maximize the coverage area. Under the optimized RIS
placement, we propose 3D hybrid beamforming at the BS and phase adjustment at
RISs, which are jointly performed at the BS and RISs via codebook-based 3D beam
scanning with low complexity. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the
proposed scheme significantly improves the average sum rate compared to the
cases of no RIS and randomly deployed RISs. It is further shown that the
proposed codebook-based 3D beam scanning efficiently aligns analog beams
between BS--user links or BS--RIS--user links and, as a consequence, achieves
the average sum rate close to that of coherent beam alignment requiring global

overall task is inferred via visual perception given a goal configuration
image, and then used to generate the primitive sequence. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of individual tactile-guided primitives and the

hijacks, networks should deploy RPKI and filter bogus BGP announcements with
invalid routes.
  In this work we evaluate the impact of RPKI deployments on the security and
resilience of the Internet. We aim to understand which networks filter invalid
routes and how effective that filtering is in blocking prefix hijacks. We
extend previous data acquisition and analysis methodologies to obtain more
accurate identification of networks that filter invalid routes with RPKI. We
find that more than 27% of networks enforce RPKI filtering and show for the
first time that deployments follow the business incentives of inter-domain
routing: providers have an increased motivation to filter in order to avoid
losing customers' traffic.
  Analyzing the effectiveness of RPKI, we find that the current trend to deploy
RPKI on routeservers of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) only provides a
localized protection against hijacks but has negligible impact on preventing
their spread globally. In contrast, we show that RPKI filtering in Tier-1
providers greatly benefits the security of the Internet as it limits the spread

sensor networks. Each sensor makes successive observations of an unknown
$d$-dimensional parameter, which might be subject to Gaussian random noises.
They aim to infer true value of the unknown parameter by cooperating with each
other. To this end, we first generalize the so-called dynamic regressor
extension and mixing (DREM) algorithm to stochastic systems, with which the
problem of estimating a $d$-dimensional vector parameter is transformed to that
of $d$ scalar ones: one for each of the unknown parameters. For each of the
scalar problem, an estimation scheme is given, where each sensor fuses the
regressors and measurements in its in-neighborhood and updates its local
estimate by using least-mean squares. Particularly, a counter is also
introduced for each sensor, which prevents any (noisy) measurement from being
repeatedly used such that the estimation performance will not be greatly
affected by certain extreme values. A novel excitation condition termed as
\textit{local persistent excitation} (Local-PE) condition is also proposed,
which relaxes the traditional persistent excitation (PE) condition and only
requires that the collective signals in each sensor's in-neighborhood are
sufficiently excited. With the Local-PE condition and proper step sizes, we
show that the proposed estimator guarantee that each sensor infers the true

The ultimate goal was to obtain constraints on the characteristics of the
ejected dust for modelling purposes. Before impact, Didymos exhibited a linear
polarization rapidly increasing with phase angle, reaching a level of about 5%
in the blue and about 4.5 in the red. The shape of the polarization spectrum
was anti-correlated with that of its reflectance spectrum, which appeared
typical of an S-class asteroid. After impact, the level of polarization dropped
by about 1 percentage point (pp) in the blue band and about 0.5 pp in the red
band, then continued to linearly increase with phase angle, with a slope
similar to that measured prior to impact. The polarization spectra, once
normalised by their values at an arbitrary wavelength, show very little or no
change over the course of all observations, before and after impact. The lack
of any remarkable change in the shape of the polarization spectrum after impact
suggests that the way in which polarization varies with wavelength depends on
the composition of the scattering material, rather than on its structure, be
this a surface or a debris cloud.

  Critical Review",,,,,"econ.EM math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We review Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimation of factor models for
high-dimensional panels of time series. We consider two cases: (1) estimation
when no dynamic model for the factors is specified (Bai and Li, 2016); (2)
estimation based on the Kalman smoother and the Expectation Maximization
algorithm thus allowing to model explicitly the factor dynamics (Doz et al.,
2012). Our interest is in approximate factor models, i.e., when we allow for
the idiosyncratic components to be mildly cross-sectionally, as well as
serially, correlated. Although such setting apparently makes estimation harder,
we show, in fact, that factor models do not suffer of the curse of
dimensionality problem, but instead they enjoy a blessing of dimensionality
property. In particular, given an approximate factor structure, if the
cross-sectional dimension of the data, $N$, grows to infinity, we show that:
(i) identification of the model is still possible, (ii) the mis-specification
error due to the use of an exact factor model log-likelihood vanishes.
Moreover, if we let also the sample size, $T$, grow to infinity, we can also
consistently estimate all parameters of the model and make inference. The same
is true for estimation of the latent factors which can be carried out by
weighted least-squares, linear projection, or Kalman filtering/smoothing. We
also compare the approaches presented with: Principal Component analysis and
the classical, fixed $N$, exact Maximum Likelihood approach. We conclude with a
discussion on efficiency of the considered estimators.

the principle of maximum conformality, a rigorous scale-setting method for

excitonic thermalization in time. Several experimental studies reported
signatures of macroscopic occupation effects at elevated exciton densities.
With respect to theory, excitons are composite particles formed by fermionic
constituents, and a general theoretical argument for a bosonic thermalization
of an exciton gas beyond the linear regime is still missing. Here, we derive an
equation for the phonon mediated thermalization at densities above the
classical limit, and identify which conditions favor the thermalization of
fermionic or bosonic character, respectively. In cases where acoustic,
quasielastic phonon scattering dominates the dynamics, our theory suggests that
transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) excitons might be bosonic enough to show
bosonic thermalization behaviour and decreasing dephasing for increasing
exciton densities. This can be interpreted as a signature of an emerging
coherence in the exciton ground state, and agrees well with the experimentally

magnetic field induces a spin-flip metamagnetic transition, which is of
first-order type at low temperatures while at higher temperatures the
transition becomes continuous. The first-order and continuous transition
segments in the field-temperature phase diagram meet at a tricritical point at

spin-flop transition, which at 2 K terminates at a field mu0Hc = 27 T that can
serve as an estimate of the anisotropy field in VBr3. The magnetization curves
above the metamagnetic transition saturate at the same value of magnetic moment
musat = 1.2 muB/f.u., which is much smaller than the spin-only (S = 1) moment
of the V3+ ion. The reduced moment can be explained by the existence of a
significant orbital magnetic moment antiparallel to the spin. The orbital
moment is a key ingredient of a mechanism responsible for the observed large

unambiguously shows that the magnetic ground state of VBr3 is the intralayer
zigzag antiferromagnetic order that renders the antiferromagnetic ground state
significantly more stable against the spin-flip transition than the other
options. The calculations also predict that a minimal distortion of the Br ion
sublattice causes a radical change of the orbital occupation in the ground
state, connected with the formation of the orbital moment and the stability of
magnetic order.

measure the effect of gravity on positronium. A Mach-Zehnder matter-wave
interferometer has been designed to operate with single-photon transitions and
to transfer high momentum to a 200 eV positronium beam. The work shows the
results and methods used to simulate the interferometer and estimate the
operating parameters and the time needed to perform the experiment. It has been
estimated that about five months of data acquisition are sufficient to achieve
a 10% level of accuracy on the positronium gravitational acceleration, even
with a poorly collimated beam, which is significant for theoretical models
describing matter-antimatter symmetry. These results pave the way for single
photon transition large momentum transfer interferometry with fast atomic
beams, which is particularly useful for studies with antimatter and unstable
atoms.

flaring event of ~120 ks in a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using
simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The ~300 ks long NuSTAR
observation and the overlapping XMM-Newton exposure were segregated into
pre-flare, flare, and post-flare segments. During the flare, the NuSTAR count
rate peaked at 2.5 times the mean count rate before the flare. Using various
physical and phenomenological models, we examined the 0.3-50 keV X-ray
spectrum, which consists of a primary continuum, reprocessed emission, warm
absorber and ultra-fast outflows in different timescales. The mass of the
central black hole is estimated to be >1.32*10^5 solar mass from the spectral
analysis. The absence of correlation between flux in 6-7 keV and 10-50 keV
bands suggests different origins of the iron emission line and the Compton
hump. From the spectral analysis, we found that the reflection fraction drops
significantly during the flare, accompanied by an increase in the coronal
height above the disc. The spectrum became soft during the flare supporting the
""softer when brighter"" nature of the source. After the alleviation of the
flare, the coronal height drops and the corona heats up. This indicates that
there could be inflation of the corona during the flare. We found no
significant change in the inner accretion disc or the seed photon temperature.
These results suggest that the flaring event occurred due to the change in the
coronal properties rather than any notable change in the accretion disc.

coordinate their motion in proximity-based control consensus schemes to
complete a common objective. However, in the event of faults or cyber attacks
to on-board positioning sensors of agents, global control performance may be
compromised resulting in a hijacking of the entire MAS. For systems that
operate in unknown or landmark-free environments (e.g., open terrain, sea, or
air) and also beyond range/proximity sensing of nearby agents, compromised
agents lose localization capabilities. To maintain resilience in these
scenarios, we propose a method to recover compromised agents by utilizing
Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) from nearby agents (i.e., mobile
landmarks) to provide reliable position measurements for localization. To
minimize estimation error: i) a multilateration scheme is proposed to leverage
RSSI and position information received from neighboring agents as mobile
landmarks and ii) a Kalman filtering method adaptively updates the unknown
RSSI-based position measurement covariance matrix at runtime that is robust to
unreliable state estimates. The proposed framework is demonstrated with
simulations on MAS formations in the presence of faults and cyber attacks to
on-board position sensors.

attributed to an increase in the available computational power, which allows

increased model complexity leads to costly deployment of modern neural
networks, while gathering such amounts of data requires huge costs to avoid
label noise. In this work, we study the ability of compression methods to
tackle both of these problems at once. We hypothesize that quantization-aware

regularization. Thus, it may help fighting overfitting on noisy data while also
allowing for the compression of the model at inference. We first validate this
claim on a controlled test with manually introduced label noise. Furthermore,
we also test the proposed method on Facial Action Unit detection, where labels
are typically noisy due to the subtlety of the task. In all cases, our results
suggests that quantization significantly improve the results compared with
existing baselines, regularization as well as other compression methods.

We focus on a special scenario where portals between dark sector and visible
sector are too weak to be detected by traditional methods. We find that this
scenario can increase the effective number of neutrinos ($N_{\text{eff}}$).In
addition, the spontaneous $U(1)'$ symmetry breaking process, which makes dark
gauge boson massive, can generate stochastic gravitational waves with peak
frequency around $10^{-6} - 10^{-7} \text{ Hz}$.

circularly polarized states have provided promising opportunities in the

the high-symmetry lines of momentum space. Here, we propose an approach based
on graph theory to study these polarization singularities in momentum space,
especially in the region off the high-symmetry lines. With a polarization
graph, it is demonstrated for the first time that BICs can stably exist off the
high-symmetry lines of momentum space for both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. Furthermore, two kinds of interesting
processes, including the merging involved with this newly found BICs both on

of photonic crystal slab. Our findings provide a new perspective to explore
polarization singularities in momentum space and render their further
applications in light-matter interaction and light manipulation.

are often provided by multiple annotators. Existing methods fuse multiple
annotations using a simple voting process, ignoring the inherent ambiguity of
edges and labeling bias of annotators. In this paper, we propose a novel
uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED), which employs uncertainty to
investigate the subjectivity and ambiguity of diverse annotations.
Specifically, we first convert the deterministic label space into a learnable
Gaussian distribution, whose variance measures the degree of ambiguity among
different annotations. Then we regard the learned variance as the estimated
uncertainty of the predicted edge maps, and pixels with higher uncertainty are
likely to be hard samples for edge detection. Therefore we design an adaptive
weighting loss to emphasize the learning from those pixels with high
uncertainty, which helps the network to gradually concentrate on the important
pixels. UAED can be combined with various encoder-decoder backbones, and the
extensive experiments demonstrate that UAED achieves superior performance
consistently across multiple edge detection benchmarks. The source code is

SPNDL disentangles neutral information from facial expressions, making it

increasing the number of samples selected into the training process, which

fully dynamic $k$-center in an arbitrary metric space that maintains an optimal
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(k \cdot \mathrm{polylog}(n,\Delta))$
amortized update time. Here, $n$ is an upper bound on the number of active

Previously, the best known amortized update time was $O(k^2\cdot

Moreover, we demonstrate that our runtime is optimal up to
$\mathrm{polylog}(n,\Delta)$ factors. In fact, we prove that even offline
algorithms for $k$-clustering tasks in arbitrary metric spaces, including
$k$-medians, $k$-means, and $k$-center, must make at least $\Omega(n k)$
distance queries to achieve any non-trivial approximation factor. This implies
a lower bound of $\Omega(k)$ which holds even for the insertions-only setting.

demonstrate that an update time sublinear in $k$ is possible against oblivious
adversaries for metric spaces which admit locally sensitive hash functions

enjoys favorable regularity, approximation, stability and (grid-free)

measure that minimizes the sum of entropic optimal transport (EOT) costs with
respect to a family of given probability measures, plus an entropy term. We
denote it $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenter, where $\lambda$ is the inner
regularization strength and $\tau$ the outer one. This formulation recovers
several previously proposed EOT barycenters for various choices of
$\lambda,\tau \geq 0$ and generalizes them. First, in spite of -- and in fact
owing to -- being \emph{doubly} regularized, we show that our formulation is
debiased for $\tau=\lambda/2$: the suboptimality in the (unregularized)
Wasserstein barycenter objective is, for smooth densities, of the order of the
strength $\lambda^2$ of entropic regularization, instead of
$\max\{\lambda,\tau\}$ in general. We discuss this phenomenon for isotropic
Gaussians where all $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenters have closed form. Second, we
show that for $\lambda,\tau>0$, this barycenter has a smooth density and is
strongly stable under perturbation of the marginals. In particular, it can be

it converges in relative entropy to the population barycenter at a rate

of the dynamics of a metameric earthworm-like robot capable of planar motion is
presented in this work. The model takes into account the complex interactions
between the robot's deformable body and the forces acting on it and draws on
the methods previously used to develop mathematical models of snake-like
robots. The proposed model represents a significant advancement in the field of
metameric robotics and has the potential to enhance the performance of
earthworm-like robots in a variety of challenging environments, such as
underground pipes and tunnels, and serves as a foundation for future research

learning future tasks or the knowledge already learned from the past tasks? In
this work, we carefully design systematic experiments using one synthetic and

Specifically, we first show through two-task CL experiments that standard CL

  Transfer Learning","Accepted to ICLR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contrastive vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) are typically created by
updating all the parameters of a vision model and language model through
contrastive training. Can such models be created by a small number of parameter
updates to an already-trained language model and vision model? The literature
describes techniques that can create vision-language models by updating a small
number of parameters in a language model, but these require already aligned
visual representations and are non-contrastive, hence unusable for
latency-sensitive applications such as neural search. We explore the
feasibility and benefits of parameter-efficient contrastive vision-language
alignment through transfer learning: creating a model such as CLIP by minimally
updating an already-trained vision and language model. We find that a minimal
set of parameter updates ($<$7%) can achieve the same performance as full-model
training, and updating specific components ($<$1% of parameters) can match 75%
of full-model training. We describe a series of experiments: we show that
existing knowledge is conserved more strongly in parameter-efficient training
and that parameter-efficient scaling scales with model and dataset size. Where
paired-image text data is scarce but strong multilingual language models exist
(e.g. low resource languages), parameter-efficient training is even preferable
to full-model training. Given a fixed compute budget, parameter-efficient
training allows training larger models on the same hardware, achieving
equivalent performance in less time. Parameter-efficient training hence
constitutes an energy-efficient and effective training strategy for contrastive
vision-language models that may be preferable to the full-model training
paradigm for common use cases. Code and weights at

activation patterns in network science, DNA coding or firing patterns in

the underlying time series is actually real-valued, and symbolization is
applied subsequently, as in symbolic dynamics of chaotic systems. Among several
time series quantifiers, time series irreversibility (the difference between

always equivalent to the one of the underlying real-valued signal, leading to
some misconceptions and confusion on interpretability. Such confusion is even
bigger for binary time series (a classical way to encode chaotic trajectories
via symbolic dynamics). In this article we aim to clarify some usual
misconceptions and provide theoretical grounding for the practical analysis --

outline sources of irreversibility in stationary symbolic sequences coming from
frequency asymmetries of non-palindromic pairs which we enumerate, and prove
that binary time series cannot show any irreversibility based on words of

also study irreversibility in the context of symbolic dynamics, and clarify why
these can be reversible even when the underlying dynamical system is not, such

items' multimodal content (\ie text and images) for effectively recommendation.
Specifically, MSM4SR tokenizes each item image into multiple textual keywords

features of items, for eliminating the discrepancy between the text and image
modalities. A novel backbone network, \ie Multimodal Mixup Sequence Encoder

multi-output (MIMO)-aided ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC)
systems. Specifically, to support multiple devices with limited pilot overhead,
pilot reuse among the users is considered, where we formulate a joint pilot
length and pilot allocation strategy for maximizing the number of devices
admitted. Then, the pilot power and transmit power are jointly optimized while
simultaneously satisfying the devices' decoding error probability, latency, and
data rate requirements. Firstly, we derive the lower bounds (LBs) of ergodic
data rate under finite channel blocklength (FCBL). Then, we propose a novel
pilot assignment algorithm for maximizing the number of devices admitted. Based
on the pilot allocation pattern advocated, the weighted sum rate (WSR) is
maximized by jointly optimizing the pilot power and payload power. To tackle
the resultant NP-hard problem, the original optimization problem is first
simplified by sophisticated mathematical transformations, and then
approximations are found for transforming the original problems into a series
of subproblems in geometric programming (GP) forms that can be readily solved.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed pilot allocation strategy is
capable of significantly increasing the number of admitted devices and the
proposed power allocation achieves substantial WSR performance gain.

as a backbone architecture for surface deep learning. The self-attention
mechanism is applied within local-mesh-windows to allow for high-resolution
sampling of the underlying data, while a shifted-window strategy improves the
sharing of information between windows. Neighbouring patches are successively
merged, allowing the MS-SiT to learn hierarchical representations suitable for
any prediction task. Results demonstrate that the MS-SiT outperforms existing
surface deep learning methods for neonatal phenotyping prediction tasks using
the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset. Furthermore, building
the MS-SiT backbone into a U-shaped architecture for surface segmentation
demonstrates competitive results on cortical parcellation using the UK Biobank
(UKB) and manually-annotated MindBoggle datasets. Code and trained models are
publicly available at

In this work, mapping from 360{\deg} panoramas to BEV semantics, the 360BEV
task, is established for the first time to achieve holistic representations of
indoor scenes in a top-down view. Instead of relying on narrow-FoV image
sequences, a panoramic image with depth information is sufficient to generate a

360BEV-Matterport and 360BEV-Stanford, both of which include egocentric

semantic maps. Besides delving deep into different mapping paradigms, we
propose a dedicated solution for panoramic semantic mapping, namely 360Mapper.

contrastive learning has been less explored for time series data. A key
component of contrastive learning is to select appropriate augmentations
imposing some priors to construct feasible positive samples, such that an
encoder can be trained to learn robust and discriminative representations.
Unlike image and language domains where ``desired'' augmented samples can be
generated with the rule of thumb guided by prefabricated human priors, the
ad-hoc manual selection of time series augmentations is hindered by their
diverse and human-unrecognizable temporal structures. How to find the desired
augmentations of time series data that are meaningful for given contrastive
learning tasks and datasets remains an open question. In this work, we address
the problem by encouraging both high \textit{fidelity} and \textit{variety}
based upon information theory. A theoretical analysis leads to the criteria for
selecting feasible data augmentations. On top of that, we propose a new
contrastive learning approach with information-aware augmentations, InfoTS,
that adaptively selects optimal augmentations for time series representation
learning. Experiments on various datasets show highly competitive performance
with up to 12.0\% reduction in MSE on forecasting tasks and up to 3.7\%

reaction pathways as they happen (\emph{in situ}) and calculating their
energetics using modern computational thermodynamics, we observe transient,

thermodynamic equilibrium dictated by local chemical potentials far before
achieving a global equilibrium set by the average composition. Using this
knowledge, one can thermodynamically ``shortcut'' unfavorable intermediates by
including additional elements beyond those of the desired target, providing
access to a greater number of intermediates with advantageous energetics and

they are vulnerable to adversarial patches that introduce perceptible and
localized perturbations to the input. Generating adversarial patches on images
has received much attention, while adversarial patches on videos have not been
well investigated. Further, decision-based attacks, where attackers only access
the predicted hard labels by querying threat models, have not been well
explored on video models either, even if they are practical in real-world video
recognition scenes. The absence of such studies leads to a huge gap in the
robustness assessment for video models. To bridge this gap, this work first
explores decision-based patch attacks on video models. We analyze that the huge
parameter space brought by videos and the minimal information returned by
decision-based models both greatly increase the attack difficulty and query
burden. To achieve a query-efficient attack, we propose a spatial-temporal
differential evolution (STDE) framework. First, STDE introduces target videos
as patch textures and only adds patches on keyframes that are adaptively
selected by temporal difference. Second, STDE takes minimizing the patch area
as the optimization objective and adopts spatialtemporal mutation and crossover
to search for the global optimum without falling into the local optimum.
Experiments show STDE has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in terms of
threat, efficiency and imperceptibility. Hence, STDE has the potential to be a
powerful tool for evaluating the robustness of video recognition models.

their efficiency does not degrade upon spatial and temporal refinement. For
that purpose, we extend algorithms based on the Laplace method for estimating
the probability of an extreme event to infinite dimensions. The method
estimates the limiting exponential scaling using a single realization of the
random variable, the large deviation minimizer. Finding this minimizer amounts
to solving an optimization problem governed by a differential equation. The
probability estimate becomes sharp when it additionally includes prefactor
information, which necessitates computing the determinant of a second
derivative operator to evaluate a Gaussian integral around the minimizer. We
present an approach in infinite dimensions based on Fredholm determinants, and
develop numerical algorithms to compute these determinants efficiently for the
high-dimensional systems that arise upon discretization. We also give an
interpretation of this approach using Gaussian process covariances and
transition tubes. An example model problem, for which we also provide an

across different layers from a deep model without hurting the performance.
Previous works focus on either single task model pruning or simply adapting it
to multitask scenario, and still face the following problems when handling
multitask pruning: 1) Due to the task mismatch, a well-pruned backbone for
classification task focuses on preserving filters that can extract
category-sensitive information, causing filters that may be useful for other
tasks to be pruned during the backbone pruning stage; 2) For multitask
predictions, different filters within or between layers are more closely
related and interacted than that for single task prediction, making multitask
pruning more difficult. Therefore, aiming at multitask model compression, we
propose a Performance-Aware Global Channel Pruning (PAGCP) framework. We first
theoretically present the objective for achieving superior GCP, by considering
the joint saliency of filters from intra- and inter-layers. Then a sequentially
greedy pruning strategy is proposed to optimize the objective, where a
performance-aware oracle criterion is developed to evaluate sensitivity of
filters to each task and preserve the globally most task-related filters.
Experiments on several multitask datasets show that the proposed PAGCP can
reduce the FLOPs and parameters by over 60% with minor performance drop, and
achieves 1.2x$\sim$3.3x acceleration on both cloud and mobile platforms.

unreachable by the operating wide-band interferometers and where various
classes of electromechanical detectors have been proposed through the years.
The minimal chirp amplitude detectable by these instruments is often set on the
basis of the sensitivities reachable by the detectors currently operating in
the audio band. By combining the observations of the pulsar timing arrays, the
limits from wide-band detectors and the other phenomenological bounds we show
that this requirement is far too generous and even misleading since the actual
detection of relic gravitons well above the kHz would demand chirp and spectral
amplitudes that are ten or even fifteen orders of magnitude smaller than the
ones currently achievable in the audio band, for the same classes of stochastic
sources. We then examine more closely the potential high-frequency signals and
show that the sensitivity in the chirp and spectral amplitudes must be even
smaller than the ones suggested by the direct and indirect constraints on the
cosmic gravitons. We finally analyze the high-frequency detectors in the
framework of Hanbury-Brown Twiss interferometry and argue that they are
actually more essential than the ones operating in the audio band (i.e. between
few Hz and few kHz) if we want to investigate the quantumness of the relic

this paper. Specifically, we will present field-ready soft robots that address
targeted productive applications in urban farming, healthcare, land and ocean
preservation, disaster remediation, and clean and affordable energy, thus
supporting some of the SDGs. By embracing soft robotics as a solution, we can

spurious or background features that co-occur with certain classes, which can
hurt generalization. To mitigate this issue, the usage of 'model guidance' has
gained popularity recently: for this, models are guided to be ""right for the
right reasons"" by regularizing the models' explanations to highlight the right
features. Experimental validation of these approaches has thus far however been
limited to relatively simple and / or synthetic datasets. To gain a better
understanding of which model-guiding approaches actually transfer to more
challenging real-world datasets, in this work we conduct an in-depth evaluation
across various loss functions, attribution methods, models, and 'guidance
depths' on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, and show that model
guidance can sometimes even improve model performance. In this context, we
further propose a novel energy loss, show its effectiveness in directing the
model to focus on object features. We also show that these gains can be
achieved even with a small fraction (e.g. 1%) of bounding box annotations,
highlighting the cost effectiveness of this approach. Lastly, we show that this

miniature (or fixational) eye movements are produced involuntarily. Fixational
eye movements are composed of slow components (physiological drift and tremor)

modeled qualitatively as a statistically self-avoiding random walk (SAW model,
see Engbert et al., 2011). In this study, we implement a data assimilation
approach for the SAW model to explain quantitative differences in experimental
data obtained from high-resolution, video-based eye tracking. We present a
likelihood function for the SAW model which allows us apply Bayesian parameter
estimation at the level of individual human participants. Based on the model
fits we find a relationship between the activation predicted by the SAW model
and the occurrence of microsaccades. The latent model activation relative to
microsaccade onsets and offsets using experimental data reveals evidence for a
triggering mechanism for microsaccades. These findings suggest that the SAW
model is capable of capturing individual differences and can serve as a tool
for exploring the relationship between physiological drift and microsaccades as
the two most important components of fixational eye movements. Our results
contribute to the understanding of individual variability in microsaccade

60 per cent, appear to be preferentially hosted by stars with higher iron mass
fraction than the Earth. It is unclear whether these iron-rich planets can form
in the disc, or if giant impacts are necessary. Here we investigate the
formation of super-Mercuries in their natal protoplanetary discs by taking into
account their host stars' abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, S). We employ a disc
evolution model which includes the growth, drift, evaporation and
recondensation of pebbles to compute the pebble iron mass fraction. The
recondensation of outward-drifting iron vapour near the iron evaporation front
is the key mechanism that facilitates an increase in the pebble iron mass
fraction. We also simulate the growth of planetary seeds around the iron
evaporation front using a planet formation model which includes pebble
accretion and planet migration, and compute the final composition of the
planets. Our simulations are able to reproduce the observed iron compositions
of the super-Mercuries provided that all the iron in the disc are locked in
pure Fe grains and that the disc viscosity is low. The combined effects of slow
orbital migration of planets and long retention time of iron vapour in
low-viscosity discs makes it easier to form iron-rich planets. Furthermore, we
find that decreasing the stellar Mg/Si ratio results in an increase in the iron
mass fraction of the planet due to a reduction in the abundance of Mg2SiO4,
which has a very similar condensation temperature as iron, in the disc. Our
results thus imply that super-Mercuries are more likely to form around stars
with low Mg/Si, in agreement with observational data.

Transformers usually use all similarities of the tokens from the query-key
pairs for the feature aggregation. However, if the tokens from the query are
different from those of the key, the self-attention values estimated from these
tokens also involve in feature aggregation, which accordingly interferes with
the clear image restoration. To overcome this problem, we propose an effective
DeRaining network, Sparse Transformer (DRSformer) that can adaptively keep the
most useful self-attention values for feature aggregation so that the
aggregated features better facilitate high-quality image reconstruction.
Specifically, we develop a learnable top-k selection operator to adaptively
retain the most crucial attention scores from the keys for each query for
better feature aggregation. Simultaneously, as the naive feed-forward network
in Transformers does not model the multi-scale information that is important
for latent clear image restoration, we develop an effective mixed-scale
feed-forward network to generate better features for image deraining. To learn
an enriched set of hybrid features, which combines local context from CNN
operators, we equip our model with mixture of experts feature compensator to
present a cooperation refinement deraining scheme. Extensive experimental

problem, especially when these teams must coordinate to accomplish a common
objective. In general, optimal solutions to these planning problems are
computationally intractable, since the decision space grows exponentially with
the number of robots. In this paper, we present a novel approach for
multi-robot planning on topological graphs using mixed-integer programming.
Central to our approach is the notion of a dynamic topological graph, where
edge weights vary dynamically based on the locations of the robots in the
graph. We construct this graph using the critical features of the planning
problem and the relationships between robots; we then leverage mixed-integer
programming to minimize a shared cost that depends on the paths of all robots
through the graph. To improve computational tractability, we formulated an
objective function with a fully convex relaxation and designed our decision
space around eliminating the exponential dependence on the number of robots. We
test our approach on a multi-robot reconnaissance scenario, where robots must
coordinate to minimize detectability and maximize safety while gathering
information. We demonstrate that our approach is able to scale to a series of
representative scenarios and is capable of computing optimal coordinated
strategic behaviors for autonomous multi-robot teams in seconds.

computationally expensive and potentially less accurate. The functionality of
PINNs for real-world physical problems can significantly improve if they become
more flexible and adaptable. To address this, our work explores the idea of
training a PINN for general boundary conditions and source terms expressed
through a limited number of coefficients, introduced as additional inputs in
the network. Although this process increases the dimensionality and is
computationally costly, using the trained network to evaluate new general
solutions is much faster. Our results indicate that PINN solutions are
relatively accurate, reliable, and well-behaved. We applied this idea to the
astrophysical scenario of the magnetic field evolution in the interior of a
neutron star connected to a force-free magnetosphere. Solving this problem
through a global simulation in the entire domain is expensive due to the
elliptic solver's needs for the exterior solution. The computational cost with
a PINN was more than an order of magnitude lower than the similar case solved
with classical methods. These results pave the way for the future extension to
3D of this (or a similar) problem, where generalised boundary conditions are

mode of transportation. To plan successful bike-sharing systems (BSSs), many
cities start from a small-scale pilot and gradually expand the system to cover
more areas. For station-based BSSs, this means planning new stations based on
existing ones over time, which requires prediction of the number of trips
generated by these new stations across the whole system. Previous studies
typically rely on relatively simple regression or machine learning models,
which are limited in capturing complex spatial relationships. Despite the
growing literature in deep learning methods for travel demand prediction, they
are mostly developed for short-term prediction based on time series data,
assuming no structural changes to the system. In this study, we focus on the
trip generation problem for BSS expansion, and propose a graph neural network
(GNN) approach to predicting the station-level demand based on multi-source
urban built environment data. Specifically, it constructs multiple localized
graphs centered on each target station and uses attention mechanisms to learn
the correlation weights between stations. We further illustrate that the
proposed approach can be regarded as a generalized spatial regression model,
indicating the commonalities between spatial regression and GNNs. The model is
evaluated based on realistic experiments using multi-year BSS data from New

sequential request patterns of multiple contents to the network, considerably
increasing the size of the input sample. This motivates us to address this

waves. Compact binaries can form and merge in AGN discs through their
interactions with the gas and other compact objects in the disc. It is also
possible for the binaries to shorten the merging timescale due to eccentricity
excitation caused by perturbations from the supermassive blackhole (SMBH). In
this paper we focus on effects due to precession-induced (eviction-like)
resonances, where nodal and apsidal precession rates of the binary is
commensurable with the mean motion of the binary around the SMBH. We focus on
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH)-stellar mass black hole (SBH) binaries, and
consider binary orbit inclined from the circum-IMBH disk which leads to the
orbital $J_2$ precession. We show that if a binary is captured in these
resonances and is migrating towards the companion, it can undergo large
eccentricity and inclination variations. We derive analytical expressions for
the location of fixed points, libration timescale and width for these
resonances, and identified two resonances in the near coplanar regime (the
evection and eviction resonances) as well as two resonances in the near polar
regime that can lead to mergers. We also derive analytical expressions for the
maximum eccentricity that a migrating binary can achieve for given initial
conditions. Specifically, the maximum eccentricity can reach 0.9 when captured
in these resonances before orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission
dominates, and the capture is only possible for slow migration ($\sim 10$ Myr)
2-3 order of magnitude longer than the resonance libration timescale. We also
show that capture into multiple resonances is possible, and can further excite
eccentricities.

machine learning model based on an LSTM recursive neural network, we
extrapolate two important pieces of information: 1) if congestion is appearing
under the sensor, and 2) the total amount of vehicles which is going to pass
under the sensor in the next future (30 min). These pieces of information are
then used to improve the accuracy of an LWR-based first-order multi-class model
describing the dynamics of traffic flow between sensors. The first piece of
information is used to invert the (concave) fundamental diagram, thus
recovering the density of vehicles from the flux data, and then inject directly
the density datum in the model. This allows one to better approximate the
dynamics between sensors, especially if an accident happens in a not monitored

boundary conditions for the equations underlying the traffic model, to better
reconstruct the total amount of vehicles on the road at any future time. Some

  analysis of climate-related financial risks",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years there has been a growing demand from financial agents,
especially from particular and institutional investors, for companies to report
on climate-related financial risks. A vast amount of information, in text
format, can be expected to be disclosed in the short term by firms in order to
identify these types of risks in their financial and non financial reports,
particularly in response to the growing regulation that is being passed on the
matter. To this end, this paper applies state-of-the-art NLP techniques to
achieve the detection of climate change in text corpora. We use transfer
learning to fine-tune two transformer models, BERT and ClimateBert -a recently
published DistillRoBERTa-based model that has been specifically tailored for
climate text classification-. These two algorithms are based on the transformer
architecture which enables learning the contextual relationships between words
in a text. We carry out the fine-tuning process of both models on the novel
Clima-Text database, consisting of data collected from Wikipedia, 10K Files
Reports and web-based claims. Our text classification model obtained from the
ClimateBert fine-tuning process on ClimaText, outperforms the models created
with BERT and the current state-of-the-art transformer in this particular
problem. Our study is the first one to implement on the ClimaText database the
recently published ClimateBert algorithm. Based on our results, it can be said
that ClimateBert fine-tuned on ClimaText is an outstanding tool within the NLP
pre-trained transformer models that may and should be used by investors,
institutional agents and companies themselves to monitor the disclosure of
climate risk in financial reports. In addition, our transfer learning
methodology is cheap in computational terms, thus allowing any organization to
perform it.

natural language understanding and generation across various domains, including
medicine. We present a comprehensive evaluation of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art
LLM, on medical competency examinations and benchmark datasets. GPT-4 is a
general-purpose model that is not specialized for medical problems through
training or engineered to solve clinical tasks. Our analysis covers two sets of
official practice materials for the USMLE, a three-step examination program
used to assess clinical competency and grant licensure in the United States. We
also evaluate performance on the MultiMedQA suite of benchmark datasets. Beyond
measuring model performance, experiments were conducted to investigate the
influence of test questions containing both text and images on model
performance, probe for memorization of content during training, and study
probability calibration, which is of critical importance in high-stakes
applications like medicine. Our results show that GPT-4, without any
specialized prompt crafting, exceeds the passing score on USMLE by over 20
points and outperforms earlier general-purpose models (GPT-3.5) as well as
models specifically fine-tuned on medical knowledge (Med-PaLM, a prompt-tuned
version of Flan-PaLM 540B). In addition, GPT-4 is significantly better
calibrated than GPT-3.5, demonstrating a much-improved ability to predict the
likelihood that its answers are correct. We also explore the behavior of the
model qualitatively through a case study that shows the ability of GPT-4 to
explain medical reasoning, personalize explanations to students, and
interactively craft new counterfactual scenarios around a medical case.
Implications of the findings are discussed for potential uses of GPT-4 in
medical education, assessment, and clinical practice, with appropriate
attention to challenges of accuracy and safety.

services. With the advancement of digitalization more users have been
preferring the online mode of performing financial activities. This has led to
the generation of a huge volume of financial content. Most investors prefer to
go through these contents before making decisions. Every industry has terms
that are specific to the domain it operates in. Banking and Financial Services
are not an exception to this. In order to fully comprehend these contents, one
needs to have a thorough understanding of the financial terms. Getting a basic
idea about a term becomes easy when it is explained with the help of the broad
category to which it belongs. This broad category is referred to as hypernym.
For example, ""bond"" is a hypernym of the financial term ""alternative
debenture"". In this paper, we propose a system capable of extracting and
ranking hypernyms for a given financial term. The system has been trained with
financial text corpora obtained from various sources like DBpedia [4],
Investopedia, Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO), prospectus and so
on. Embeddings of these terms have been extracted using FinBERT [3], FinISH [1]
and fine-tuned using SentenceBERT [54]. A novel approach has been used to
augment the training set with negative samples. It uses the hierarchy present
in FIBO. Finally, we benchmark the system performance with that of the existing
ones. We establish that it performs better than the existing ones and is also
scalable.

measuring. Specifically, graph kernels are widely used in fields of
bioinformatics, chemistry and financial data analysis. However, existing

computational complexity and the negligence of node-level information. In this
paper, we propose a novel labeled subgraph entropy graph kernel, which performs
well in structural similarity assessment. We design a dynamic programming
subgraph enumeration algorithm, which effectively reduces the time complexity.
Specially, we propose labeled subgraph, which enriches substructure topology

cluster in statistical mechanics, we re-derive the partition function and
calculate the global graph entropy to characterize the network. In order to
test our method, we apply several real-world datasets and assess the effects in

Experimental results successfully demonstrate the effectiveness of our method

with the development of civilization and human migration. The same is true for
music. To understand the complex structure behind the music, we introduced an
algorithm called the Essential Element Network (EEN) to encode the audio into
text. The network is obtained by calculating the correlations between scales,
time, and volume. Optimizing EEN to generate Zipfs law for the frequency and
rank of the clustering coefficient enables us to generate and regard the
semantic relationships as words. We map these encoded words into the
scale-temporal space, which helps us organize systematically the syntax in the
deep structure of music. Our algorithm provides precise descriptions of the
complex network behind the music, as opposed to the black-box nature of other
deep learning approaches. As a result, the experience and properties
accumulated through these processes can offer not only a new approach to the
applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) but also an easier and more
objective way to analyze the evolution and development of music.

commissioned at CRIS, which improved the scanning speed by a factor of three as
compared to the current laser-frequency scanning approach. This leads to faster
measurements of the hyperfine structure for systems with high yields (more than
a few thousand ions per second). Additionally, several beamline sections have
been redesigned and manufactured, including a new field-ionization unit, a
sharper electrostatic bend, and improved ion optics. The beamline upgrades are
expected to yield an improvement of at least a factor of 5 in the
signal-to-noise ratio by suppressing the non-resonant laser ions and providing
time-of-flight separation between the resonant ions and the collisional
background. Overall, the presented developments will further improve the
selectivity, sensitivity, and efficiency of the CRIS technique.

technologies, large services in traditional systems (e.g. the computation
services of machine learning and artificial intelligence) are gradually being
broken down into many microservices to increase service reusability and
flexibility. Therefore, this study proposes an efficiency analysis framework
based on queuing models to analyze the efficiency difference of breaking down
traditional large services into n microservices. For generalization, this study
considers different service time distributions (e.g. exponential distribution
of service time and fixed service time) and explores the system efficiency in
the worst-case and best-case scenarios through queuing models (i.e. M/M/1
queuing model and M/D/1 queuing model). In each experiment, it was shown that
the total time required for the original large service was higher than that
required for breaking it down into multiple microservices, so breaking it down
into multiple microservices can improve system efficiency. It can also be
observed that in the best-case scenario, the improvement effect becomes more
significant with an increase in arrival rate. However, in the worst-case
scenario, only slight improvement was achieved. This study found that breaking
down into multiple microservices can effectively improve system efficiency and
proved that when the computation time of the large service is evenly
distributed among multiple microservices, the best improvement effect can be
achieved. Therefore, this study's findings can serve as a reference guide for
future development of microservice architecture.

switching from the state-space representation of Molecular Dynamics (MD) to a
statistical-mechanics-based representation in phase space, where approximations
such as maximum-entropy or Gaussian phase packets (GPP) evolve the atomistic
ensemble in a time-coarsened fashion. In practice, this requires the
computation of expensive high-dimensional integrals over all of phase space of
an atomistic ensemble. This, in turn, is commonly accomplished efficiently by
low-order numerical quadrature. We show that numerical quadrature in this
context, unfortunately, comes with a set of inherent problems, which corrupt
the accuracy of simulations -- especially when dealing with crystal lattices
with imperfections. As a remedy, we demonstrate that Graph Neural Networks,
trained on Monte-Carlo data, can serve as a replacement for commonly used
numerical quadrature rules, overcoming their deficiencies and significantly
improving the accuracy. This is showcased by three benchmarks: the thermal
expansion of copper, the martensitic phase transition of iron, and the energy
of grain boundaries. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed technique over
classically used third- and fifth-order Gaussian quadrature, we highlight the
impact on time-coarsened atomistic predictions, and we discuss the
computational efficiency. The latter is of general importance when performing
frequent evaluation of phase space or other high-dimensional integrals, which
is why the proposed framework promises applications beyond the scope of
atomistics.

narrowband features of some desired isolated line models together with the far
wing behavior of the projection based strong collision (SC) method to line
mixing which was introduced by Bulanin, Dokuchaev, Tonkov and Filippov. The
method can be viewed in terms of a small diagonal perturbation of the SC
relaxation matrix providing the required narrowband accuracy close to the line
centers at the same time as the SC line coupling transfer rates are retained
and can be optimally scaled to thermalize the radiator after impact. The method
can conveniently be placed in the framework of the Boltzmann-Liouville
transport equation where a rigorous diagonalization of the line mixing problem
requires that molecular phase and velocity changes are assumed to be
uncorrelated. A detailed analysis for the general Doppler case is given based
on the first order Rosenkranz approximation, and which also provides the
possibility to incorporate quadratically speed dependent parameters. Exact
solutions for pure pressure broadening and explicit Rosenkranz approximations

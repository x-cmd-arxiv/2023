scientific community to discriminate real images from those generated by
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models: a binary classification task. In this
work, the deepfake detection and recognition task was investigated by
collecting a dedicated dataset of pristine images and fake ones generated by 9
different Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architectures and by 4
additional Diffusion Models (DM). A hierarchical multi-level approach was then
introduced to solve three different deepfake detection and recognition tasks:
(i) Real Vs AI generated; (ii) GANs Vs DMs; (iii) AI specific architecture
recognition. Experimental results demonstrated, in each case, more than 97%
classification accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

end, we evaluate a diverse selection of cutting-edge UAD methods on multiple
medical datasets, comparing them against the established SOTA in UAD for brain
MRI. Our experiments demonstrate that newly developed feature-modeling methods
from the industrial and medical literature achieve increased performance
compared to previous work and set the new SOTA in a variety of modalities and

modify images, especially images of faces, posted online. Considering the
important role of human facial perception in social communication, how does
exposure to an increasing number of modified faces online affect human facial
perception? In this paper we present the results of six surveys designed to
measure familiarity with different styles of facial filters, perceived
strangeness of faces edited with different facial filters, and ability to
discern whether images are filtered or not. Our results indicate that faces
filtered with photo editing filters that change the image color tones, modify
facial structure, or add facial beautification tend to be perceived similarly
to unmodified faces; however, faces filtered with augmented reality filters
(\textit{i.e.,} filters that overlay digital objects) are perceived differently
from unmodified faces. We also found that responses differed based on different
survey question phrasings, indicating that the shift in facial perception due
to the prevalence of filtered images is noisy to detect. A better understanding
of shifts in facial perception caused by facial filters will help us build
online spaces more responsibly and could inform the training of more accurate

FSTSP by combining local search methods and dynamic programming. Similar
algorithms exist in the literature. Our algorithm, however, considers more
sophisticated chromosomes and simpler dynamic programming to enable broader
exploration by the genetic algorithm and efficient exploitation through dynamic

discovery of how decision-making processes should be divided among the layers
of genetic algorithm, dynamic programming, and local search. In particular, our
genetic algorithm generates the truck and the drone sequences separately and
encodes them in a type-aware chromosome, wherein each customer is assigned to
either the truck or the drone. We apply local searches to each chromosome,
which is decoded by dynamic programming for fitness evaluation. Our dynamic
programming algorithm merges the two sequences by determining optimal launch
and landing locations for the drone to construct a TSPD solution represented by
the chromosome. We propose novel type-aware order crossover operations and
effective local search methods. A strategy to escape from local optima is
proposed. Our new algorithm is shown to outperform existing algorithms on most

critical requirements for modern autonomous robotic systems. One of the
essential steps to achieve robustness and resilience is the ability of SLAM to
have an integrity measure for its localization estimates, and thus, have
internal fault tolerance mechanisms to deal with performance degradation. In
this work, we introduce a novel method for predicting SLAM localization error
based on the characterization of raw sensor inputs. The proposed method relies
on using a random forest regression model trained on 1-D global pooled features
that are generated from characterized raw sensor data. The model is validated
by using it to predict the performance of ORB-SLAM3 on three different datasets
running on four different operating modes, resulting in an average prediction
accuracy of up to 94.7\%. The paper also studies the impact of 12 different 1-D

global averaging is quantitatively proven. Finally, the paper studies the
quality of prediction with limited training data, and proves that we are able
to maintain proper prediction quality when only 20 \% of the training examples
are used for training, which highlights how the proposed model can optimize the

  Performance Analysis and Resource Allocation",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In conventional dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, the radar
and communication channels are routinely estimated at fixed time intervals
based on their worst-case operation scenarios. Such situation-agnostic repeated
estimations cause significant training overhead and dramatically degrade the
system performance, especially for applications with dynamic
sensing/communication demands and limited radio resources. In this paper, we
leverage the channel aging characteristics to reduce training overhead and to
design a situation-dependent channel re-estimation interval optimization-based
resource allocation for performance improvement in a multi-target tracking DFRC
system. Specifically, we exploit the channel temporal correlation to predict
radar and communication channels for reducing the need of training preamble
retransmission.
  Then, we characterize the channel aging effects on the Cramer-Rao lower
bounds (CRLBs) for radar tracking performance analysis and achievable rates
with maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) transmit
beamforming for communication performance analysis. In particular, the aged
CRLBs and achievable rates are derived as closed-form expressions with respect
to the channel aging time, bandwidth, and power. Based on the analyzed results,
we optimize these factors to maximize the average total aged achievable rate
subject to individual target tracking precision demand, communication rate
requirement, and other practical constraints. Since the formulated problem
belongs to a non-convex problem, we develop an efficient one-dimensional search
based optimization algorithm to obtain its suboptimal solutions. Finally,
simulation results are presented to validate the correctness of the derived
theoretical results and the effectiveness of the proposed allocation scheme.

i.e., the generation of graphs which have given values of various numerical
measures that characterize networks, such as the clustering coefficient and the
number of cycles of given lengths. Algorithms for the generation of synthetic
graphs are often based on graph growth models, i.e., rules of adding (and
sometimes removing) nodes and edges to a graph that mimic the processes present
in real-world networks. While such graph generators are desirable from a
theoretical point of view, they are often only able to reproduce a narrow set
of properties of real-world networks, resulting in graphs with otherwise
unrealistic properties. In this article, we instead evaluate common graph
generation algorithms at the task of reproducing the numerical statistics of
real-world networks, such as the clustering coefficient, the degree
assortativity, and the connectivity. We also propose an iterative algorithm,
the Guided Graph Generator, based on a greedy-like procedure that recovers
realistic values over a large number of commonly used graph statistics, while
at the same time allowing an efficient implementation based on incremental
updating of only a small number of subgraph counts. We show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms previous graph generation algorithms in terms of the
error in the reconstructed graphs for a large number of graph statistics such
as the clustering coefficient, the assortativity, the mean node distance, and
also evaluate the algorithm in terms of precision, speed of convergence and
scalability, and compare it to previous graph generators and models. We also
show that the proposed algorithm generates graphs with realistic degree

the age of a glass with the support of machine learning. We employ a supervised

that this neural network can accurately classify the age of our system across

enable this reuse, we decompose the collision checking into reusable, and
non-reusable parts. We then treat the sequences of path planning problems in

spectrum as a diagnostic probe. In a simple setup where both species are
initialized with the same total matter transfer function, biased growth of
power forms on small scales when the solver force resolution is finer than the
mean interparticle separation. The artificial bias is more severe when
individual density and velocity transfer functions are applied. In particular,
significant large-scale offsets in power are measured between simulations with
conventional offset grid initial conditions when compared against converged
high-resolution results where the force resolution scale is matched to the
interparticle separation. These offsets persist even when the cosmology is
chosen so that the two particle species have the same mass, indicating that the
error is sourced from discreteness in the total matter field as opposed to
unequal particle mass. We further investigate two mitigation strategies to
address discreteness errors: the frozen potential method and softened
interspecies short-range forces. The former evolves particles under the
approximately ""frozen"" total matter potential in linear theory at early times,
while the latter filters cross-species gravitational interactions on small
scales in low density regions. By modeling closer to the continuum limit, both
mitigation strategies demonstrate considerable reductions in large-scale power
spectrum offsets.

overlap between the estimated segmentation and a reference standard (e.g.,
manual segmentation). In this work, we investigated whether evaluating AI-based
segmentation methods using Dice scores yields a similar interpretation as
evaluation on the clinical tasks of quantifying metabolic tumor volume (MTV)
and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumor from PET images of patients
with non-small cell lung cancer. The investigation was conducted via a
retrospective analysis with the ECOG-ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 multi-center clinical

picture, and one in which systems are modelled in a magnetically ordered state,
which is ferrimagnetic for the alloys considered in this work. We show that the
treatment of magnetism can have significant impact both on the predicted

CrCoNi, we find that the nature of atomic order changes from being
$\mathrm{L}1_2$-like when modelled in the paramagnetic state to MoPt$_2$-like
when modelled assuming the system has magnetically ordered. In CrFeCoNi, atomic
correlations between Fe and the other elements present are dramatically
strengthened when we switch from treating the system as magnetically disordered

introduce the compressible Elsasser fields (canonical variables) and show their
linear relationship with the mass density and the compressible velocity. The
kinetic equations of wave turbulence for three-wave interactions are obtained
and the detailed conservation is shown for the two invariants, energy and
momentum (cross-helicity). An exact stationary solution (Kolmogorov-Zakharov
spectrum) exists only for the energy. I find a $k^{-3/2}$ energy spectrum
compatible with the Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (IK) phenomenological prediction; this
leads to a mass density spectrum with the same scaling. Despite the presence of
a relatively strong uniform magnetic field, this turbulence is characterized by
an energy spectrum with a power index that is independent of the angular
direction; its amplitude, however, shows an angular dependence. I prove the
existence of the IK solution using the locality condition, show that the energy
flux is positive and hence the cascade direct, and find the Kolmogorov
constant. This theory offers a plausible explanation for recent observations in
the solar wind at small $\beta$ where isotropic spectra with a $-3/2$ power law
index are found and associated with fast magneto-acoustic waves. This theory
may also be used to explain the IK spectrum often observed near the Sun.
Besides, it provides a rigorous theoretical basis for the well-known

multiple stages, similarly to liquid crystals. In the partially-melted phases,
known as vestigial phases, a bilinear made out of combinations of the multiple
components of the primary order parameter condenses. Multi-component
superconductors are thus natural candidates for vestigial order, since they
break both the U(1)-gauge and also time-reversal or lattice symmetries. Here,
we use group theory to classify all possible real-valued and complex-valued
bilinears of a generic two-component superconductor on a tetragonal or
hexagonal lattice. While the more widely investigated real-valued bilinears
correspond to vestigial nematic or ferromagnetic order, the little explored
complex-valued bilinears correspond to a vestigial charge-$4e$ condensate,
which itself can have an underlying $s$-wave, $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave, or
$d_{xy}$-wave symmetry. To properly describe the fluctuating regime of the
superconducting Ginzburg-Landau action and thus access these competing
vestigial phases, we employ both a large-N and a variational method. We show
that while vestigial order can be understood as a weak-coupling effect in the
large-N approach, it is akin to a moderate-coupling effect in the variational
method. Despite these distinctions, both methods yield similar results in wide
regions of the parameter space spanned by the quartic Landau coefficients.
Specifically, we find that the nematic and ferromagnetic phases are the leading
vestigial instabilities, whereas the various types of charge-$4e$ order are
attractive albeit subleading vestigial channels. The only exception is for the
hexagonal case, in which the nematic and $s$-wave charge-4e vestigial states
are degenerate. We discuss the limitations of our approach, as well as the
implications of our results for the realization of exotic charge-4e states in
material candidates.

of research. At the same time, the community has started to realize the
importance of protecting the privacy of ML training data.
  Differential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard for making formal
statements about data anonymization. However, while some adoption of DP has
happened in industry, attempts to apply DP to real world complex ML models are
still few and far between. The adoption of DP is hindered by limited practical
guidance of what DP protection entails, what privacy guarantees to aim for, and
the difficulty of achieving good privacy-utility-computation trade-offs for ML
models. Tricks for tuning and maximizing performance are scattered among papers
or stored in the heads of practitioners. Furthermore, the literature seems to
present conflicting evidence on how and whether to apply architectural
adjustments and which components are ""safe"" to use with DP.
  This work is a self-contained guide that gives an in-depth overview of the
field of DP ML and presents information about achieving the best possible DP ML
model with rigorous privacy guarantees. Our target audience is both researchers
and practitioners. Researchers interested in DP for ML will benefit from a
clear overview of current advances and areas for improvement. We include
theory-focused sections that highlight important topics such as privacy
accounting and its assumptions, and convergence. For a practitioner, we provide
a background in DP theory and a clear step-by-step guide for choosing an
appropriate privacy definition and approach, implementing DP training,
potentially updating the model architecture, and tuning hyperparameters. For
both researchers and practitioners, consistently and fully reporting privacy
guarantees is critical, and so we propose a set of specific best practices for
stating guarantees.

to the presence of disorder. Then we describe the non-linear sigma model (NLSM)
with interactions (Finkel'stein's model). This model is closely connected to
the Fermi liquid, but is more generally applicable, since it can also be viewed
as a minimal effective functional describing disordered interacting electrons.
Our discussion emphasizes the general structure of the theory, and the
connection of the scaling parameters to conservation laws. We then move on to
discuss the metal-insulator transition (MIT) in the disordered electron liquid
in two and three dimensions. This MIT is a non-trivial example of a quantum
phase transition. The NLSM approach allows to identify the dynamical exponent
connecting the spatial and energy scales, which is central for the description
of the kinetic and thermodynamic behavior in the critical region of the MIT in
three dimensions. In two dimensions, the system can be discussed in terms of a
flow in the disorder-interaction phase plane, which is controlled by a fixed
point. We demonstrate that the two-parameter RG-equations accurately describe
electrons in Si-MOSFETs including the observed non-monotonic behavior of the
resistance and its strong drop at low temperatures. The theory can also be
applied to systems with an attractive interaction in the Cooper channel, where
it describes the suppression of superconductivity in disordered amorphous
films. We extend our discussion to heat transport in the two-dimensional
electron liquid. Similar to the electric conductivity, the thermal conductivity
also acquires logarithmic corrections induced by electron interaction and
disorder. The resulting thermal conductivity can be calculated in the NLSM
formalism after introducing so-called gravitational potentials.

stacked images, and noise reduced images. We show that we are able to reduce

feel unrepresented by such a majority-driven policy than represented. A natural
resolution is to come up with a policy that deviates a bit from the majority

insulators such as Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, where an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT)
can be induced by a weak electric field or current. This phenomenon has
numerous potential applications in, e.g., neuromorphic computing. While the
driving force of the IMT is poorly understood, it has been thought to be a
breakdown of the Mott state. Using in operando angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we show that this is not the case: The current-driven conductive
phase arises with only a minor reorganisation of the Mott state. This can be
explained by the co-existence of structurally different domains that emerge
during the IMT. Electronic structure calculations show that the boundaries
between domains of slightly different structure lead to a drastic reduction of
the overall gap. This permits an increased conductivity, despite the persistent
presence of the Mott state. This mechanism represents a paradigm shift in the
understanding of IMTs, because it does not rely on the simultaneous presence of
a metallic and an insulating phase, but rather on the combined effect of
structurally inhomogeneous Mott phases.

queries can be answered in $O(\log n)$ time. Alternatively, we can achieve a
space complexity of $O(n^{9+\varepsilon })$ by relaxing the query time to
$O(\log^2 n)$. This is the first improvement upon a conference paper by Chiang
and Mitchell from 1999. They present a data structure with $O(n^{11})$ space
complexity and $O(\log n)$ query time. Our main result can be extended to
include a space-time trade-off. Specifically, we devise data structures with
$O(n^{9+\varepsilon}/\hspace{1pt} \ell^{4 + O(\varepsilon )})$ space complexity
and $O(\ell \log^2 n )$ query time, for any integer $1 \leq \ell \leq n$.
  Furthermore, we present improved data structures with $O(\log n)$ query time
for the special case where we restrict one (or both) of the query points to lie
on the boundary of $P$. When one of the query points is restricted to lie on
the boundary, and the other query point is unrestricted, the space complexity
becomes $O(n^{6+\varepsilon})$. When both query points are on the boundary, the
space complexity is decreased further to $O(n^{4+\varepsilon })$, thereby
improving an earlier result of Bae and Okamoto.

the almost perfect symplectic symmetry in nuclei. Specifically, we study
excitation energies, point-proton root-mean-square radii, along with electric
quadrupole moments and transitions for 6Li and 12C. We show that the set of

slightly varies details that affect collective quadrupole moments, asymptotic

analyze the correlation structure of different node important metrics based on

find that some metrics have many similarities and dissimilarities, especially

poor crop production play a major role in import trade, whereas economies with

sequential-decision problems where an agent must pursue a goal while minimizing

criterion that allows modeling an arbitrary level of risk by considering the
expectation of a fraction $\alpha$ of worse trajectories. Although an optimal
policy is non-Markovian, solutions of CVaR-SSP can be found approximately with
Value Iteration based algorithms such as CVaR Value Iteration with Linear
Interpolation (CVaRVIQ) and CVaR Value Iteration via Quantile Representation
(CVaRVILI). These type of solutions depends on the algorithm's parameters such
as the number of atoms and $\alpha_0$ (the minimum $\alpha$). To compare the
policies returned by these algorithms, we need a way to exactly evaluate
stationary policies of CVaR-SSPs. Although there is an algorithm that evaluates
these policies, this only works on problems with uniform costs. In this paper,
we propose a new algorithm, Forward-PECVaR (ForPECVaR), that evaluates exactly

Polarized Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) for precision measurement of
the polarization of the $\sim$100 GeV/n helion beam. At the Relativistic Heavy
Ion Collider, HJET serves to determine absolute proton beam polarization with
low systematic uncertainties of about $\delta^\text{syst}P/P\lesssim0.5\%$. To
adapt the HJET method for the EIC helion beam, the experimentally determined
ratio of the beam and target (jet) spin correlated asymmetries should be
adjusted by the ratio of $p^\uparrow{h}$ and $h^\uparrow{p}$ analyzing powers
$A_\text{N}^{ph}(t)/A_\text{N}^{hp}(t)$ which, in the leading order
approximation, is predefined by magnetic moments of the proton and helion,
$(\mu_p-1)/(\mu_h/2-1/3)$. However, to achieve the required accuracy in the

due to possible beam $^3$He breakup should be considered. Here a more accurate

  Science",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Effective usage of renewable energy requires ways of storage and delivery to
balance energy demand and availability divergences. Carbon-free chemical energy
carriers are proposed solutions, converting clean electricity into stable media
for storage and long-distance energy trade. Hydrogen (H$_2$) is the subject of
significant investment and research. Metal fuels, such as iron (Fe), are
promising solutions for a clean energy supply, but establishing an
interconnected ecosystem still requires considerable research and development.
A model is proposed to assess the supply chain of hydrogen and iron as clean,
carbon-free energy carriers and then examines case studies of possible trade
routes between the potential energy exporters Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and
Australia and importers Germany and Japan. The work comprehends the assessment
of economic (levelized cost of electricity - LCOE), energetic (thermodynamic
efficiency) and environmental (CO$_2$ emissions) aspects, quantified by the
comprehensive model accounting for the most critical processes in the supply
chain. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses identify the main drivers for
energy costs. Iron is shown to be lower-cost and more efficient to transport in
longer routes and for long-term storage, but potentially more expensive and
less efficient than H$_2$ to produce and convert. Uncertainties related to the
supply chain specifications and the sensitivity to the used variables indicate
that the path to viable energy carriers fundamentally depends on efficient
synthesis, conversion, storage, and transport. A break-even analysis
demonstrated that clean energy carriers could be competitive with conventional
energy carriers at low renewable energy prices, while carbon taxes might be
needed to level the playing field. Thereby, green iron is an important
potential energy carrier for long-distance trade in a globalized clean energy
market.

being too expensive for large solid-state systems due to the use of the exact
exchange operator. In this work, we use physics-informed machine learning to
design an exchange functional that is both orbital-dependent and nonlocal, but
which can be evaluated at roughly the cost of semi-local functionals and is
significantly faster than hybrid DFT in plane-wave codes. By training
functionals with several different feature sets, we elucidate the roles of
orbital-dependent and nonlocal features in learning the exchange energy and
determine that both types of features provide vital and independently important
information to the model. Having trained our new exchange functional with an
expressive, nonlocal feature set, we substitute it into existing hybrid
functionals to achieve hybrid-DFT accuracy on thermochemical benchmark sets and
improve the accuracy of band gap predictions over semi-local DFT. To
demonstrate the scalability of our approach as well as the practical benefits
of improved band gap prediction, we compute charged defect transition levels in
silicon using large supercells. Due to its transferability and computational
efficiency for both molecular and extended systems, our model overcomes the
cost-accuracy trade-off between semi-local and hybrid DFT, and our general
approach provides a feasible path toward a universal exchange-correlation

twisted moir\'e systems, cold-atom optical lattices, quantum Hall systems, and
triangular antiferromagnets, we phenomenologically investigate the
strain-temperature phase diagram of the electronic 3-state Potts-nematic order.
While in the absence of strain the quantum Potts-nematic transition is
first-order, quantum critical points (QCP) emerge when uniaxial strain is
applied, whose nature depends on whether the strain is compressive or tensile.
In one case, the nematic amplitude jumps between two non-zero values while the
nematic director remains pinned, leading to a symmetry-preserving meta-nematic
transition that terminates at a quantum critical end-point. For the other type
of strain, the nematic director unlocks from the strain direction and
spontaneously breaks an in-plane twofold rotational symmetry, which in twisted
moir\'e superlattices triggers an electric polarization. Such a piezoelectric
transition changes from first to second-order upon increasing strain, resulting
in a quantum tricritical point. Using a Hertz-Millis approach, we show that
these QCPs share interesting similarities with the widely studied Ising-nematic
QCP. The existence of three minima in the nematic action also leaves
fingerprints in the strain-nematic hysteresis curves, which display multiple
loops. At non-zero temperatures, because the upper critical dimension of the
3-state Potts model is smaller than three, the Potts-nematic transition is
expected to remain first-order in 3D, but to change to second-order in 2D. As a
result, the 2D strain-temperature phase diagram displays two first-order
transition wings bounded by lines of critical end-points or tricritical points,
reminiscent of the phase diagram of metallic ferromagnets. We discuss how our
results can be used to unambiguously identify spontaneous Potts-nematic order.

area affected by a flood event to emergency-relief units in near-real-time.
Building upon the recent development of the Sen1Floods11 dataset, which
provides a limited amount of hand-labeled high-quality training data, this
paper evaluates the potential of five traditional machine learning approaches
such as gradient boosted decision trees, support vector machines or quadratic
discriminant analysis. By performing a grid-search-based hyperparameter
optimization on 23 feature spaces we can show that all considered classifiers
are capable of outperforming the current state-of-the-art neural network-based
approaches in terms of total IoU on their best-performing feature spaces. With
total and mean IoU values of 0.8751 and 0.7031 compared to 0.70 and 0.5873 as
the previous best-reported results, we show that a simple gradient boosting
classifier can significantly improve over deep neural network based approaches,
despite using less training data. Furthermore, an analysis of the regional
distribution of the Sen1Floods11 dataset reveals a problem of spatial
imbalance. We show that traditional machine learning models can learn this bias
and argue that modified metric evaluations are required to counter artifacts
due to spatial imbalance. Lastly, a qualitative analysis shows that this
pixel-wise classifier provides highly-precise surface water classifications
indicating that a good choice of a feature space and pixel-wise classification
can generate high-quality flood maps using optical and SAR data. We make our

techniques typically employ an acoustic front end (AFE) cascaded with a neural

beamforming output in AFE is steered to a wrong direction. A promising way to
address this issue is to exploit the microphone signals before the beamforming
stage and after the acoustic echo cancellation (post-AEC) in AFE. We argue that
both, post-AEC and AFE outputs, are complementary and it is possible to
leverage the redundancy between these signals to compensate for potential AFE
processing errors. We present two fusion networks to explore this redundancy
and aggregate these multi-channel (MC) signals: (1) Frequency-LSTM based, and
(2) Convolutional Neural Network based fusion networks. We augment the MC
fusion networks to a conformer transducer model and train it in an end-to-end

demonstrate that using the AFE output and two post-AEC signals with fusion

expectation value of a singlet scalar, leaving a residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$
symmetry that stabilizes dark matter (DM). A complex CKM matrix arises via
one-loop corrections to the quark mass matrix mediated by the dark sector. In
contrast with other proposals where non-zero contributions to the strong CP
phase arise at the one-loop level, in our case this only occurs at three loops,
enhancing naturalness. Our scenario also provides a viable WIMP scalar DM

neural networks to predict wall quantities in a turbulent open channel flow.
The first tests are performed by training a fully-convolutional network (FCN)
to predict the 2D velocity-fluctuation fields at the inner-scaled wall-normal
location $y^{+}_{\rm target}$, using the sampled velocity fluctuations in
wall-parallel planes located farther from the wall, at $y^{+}_{\rm input}$. The
predictions from the FCN are compared against the predictions from a proposed
R-Net architecture. Since the R-Net model is found to perform better than the
FCN model, the former architecture is optimized to predict the 2D streamwise
and spanwise wall-shear-stress components and the wall pressure from the
sampled velocity-fluctuation fields farther from the wall. The dataset is
obtained from DNS of open channel flow at $Re_{\tau} = 180$ and $550$. The
turbulent velocity-fluctuation fields are sampled at various inner-scaled
wall-normal locations, along with the wall-shear stress and the wall pressure.
At $Re_{\tau}=550$, both FCN and R-Net can take advantage of the
self-similarity in the logarithmic region of the flow and predict the
velocity-fluctuation fields at $y^{+} = 50$ using the velocity-fluctuation
fields at $y^{+} = 100$ as input with about 10% error in prediction of
streamwise-fluctuations intensity. Further, the R-Net is also able to predict
the wall-shear-stress and wall-pressure fields using the velocity-fluctuation
fields at $y^+ = 50$ with around 10% error in the intensity of the
corresponding fluctuations at both $Re_{\tau} = 180$ and $550$. These results
are an encouraging starting point to develop neural-network-based approaches
for modelling turbulence near the wall in large-eddy simulations.

that the unusually short radiative lifetimes in these materials is due to an
optically bright excitonic ground state, a unique situation among all
nanomaterials. This proposal was based on the influence of the Rashba effect
driven by lattice-induced inversion symmetry breaking. Direct measurement of
the excitonic emission under magnetic fields has shown the signature of a dark
ground state, bringing the role of the Rashba effect into question. Here, we
use a fully atomistic theory to model the exciton fine structure of perovskite
nanocrystals accounting for the realistic lattice distortion at the nanoscale.
We calculate optical gaps and exciton fine structure that compare favorably
with a wide range of experimental works. We find a non-monotonic dependence of
the exciton fine structure splittings due to a size dependence structural
transition between cubic and orthorhombic phases. In addition, the excitonic
ground state is found to be dark with nearly pure spin triplet character
resulting from a small Rashba coupling. We additionally explore the intertwined
effects of lattice distortion and nanocrystal shape on the fine structure
splittings, clarifying observations on poly-disperse nanocrystals.

outcome of complete Cholesky factorization. Unlike earlier approaches, our
sampling always maintains a connectivity in the remaining non-zero structure.
Our algorithm comes with a tuning parameter that upper bounds the number of

study of this problem was focused on two-dimensional cases and for a screen

involved a porous object in a three-dimensional free flow, we present a
three-dimensional model for porous screens, initially based on Koo & James
(1973) and Steiros & Hultmark (2018), accounting for viscous effects at the
vicinity of the screen, from which we can derive velocities, pressure
distribution as well as aerodynamic forces. We then characterize experimentally
the aerodynamic drag coefficient for a porous square screen, composed of
fibers, immersed in a laminar air flow with different angles of attack. We test
various fiber diameters to explore the effect of the space between the pores on
the drag force. The drag prediction from the model is in good agreement with
our experimental results. Our theoretical results, supported by experiments,
suggest that for high solidity, a homogeneous porous screens composed of fibers
can have a higher drag coefficient than a flat plate with the same dimensions.
We also show that for the same solidity the Reynolds number based on the fiber
diameter of the porous screen has a strong influence on the drag coefficient.
The model, taking into account three-dimensional effects and the shape of the
porous screen, may have many applications including the determination of water
collection for fog harvesters.

of limitations. The multi-process fusion systems usually involve employing
brute force and running all available VPR techniques simultaneously while the
switching method attempts to negate this practise by only selecting the best
suited VPR technique for given query image. But switching does fail at times
when no available suitable technique can be identified. An innovative solution
would be an amalgamation of the two otherwise discrete approaches to combine
their competitive advantages while negating their shortcomings. The proposed,
Switch-Fuse system, is an interesting way to combine both the robustness of
switching VPR techniques based on complementarity and the force of fusing the
carefully selected techniques to significantly improve performance. Our system
holds a structure superior to the basic fusion methods as instead of simply
fusing all or any random techniques, it is structured to first select the best
possible VPR techniques for fusion, according to the query image. The system
combines two significant processes, switching and fusing VPR techniques, which
together as a hybrid model substantially improve performance on all major VPR

behavior of $\alpha_s$ at low $Q^2$ in the nonperturbative QCD domain is
critical for understanding strong interaction phenomena, including the
emergence of mass and quark confinement. The behavior of $\alpha_s(Q^2)$ at all

$\zeta\in(0,1)$ of the subexponential decay of the cluster-size distribution.
That is, with $|\mathcal{C}(0)|$ denoting the number of vertices in the

respect to three main model parameters: the Euclidean dimension $d$, the
power-law tail exponent $\tau$ of the degree distribution and a long-range
parameter $\alpha$ governing the presence of long edges in Euclidean space. In
this paper we present the proof for the region in the phase diagram where the
model is a generalization of continuum scale-free percolation and/or hyperbolic
random graphs: $\zeta$ in this regime depends both on $\tau,\alpha$. We also
prove that the second-largest component in a box of volume $n$ is of size
$\Theta(\log(n)^{1/\zeta+o(1)})$ with high probability. We develop a
deterministic algorithm as a new methodology: we allocate to each partially

volume linear in the number of vertices in $\mathcal C$, so that
not-yet-revealed vertices with spatial location in $\mathcal K(\mathcal C)$
have good connection probability to $\mathcal C$. This algorithm makes it
possible to prove that too large components $\mathcal C$ -- regardless of the

  This paper tackles these two challenges to solve the rotation estimation of a

Applying this formalism to diffraction-limited nonlocal metalenses with a wide

instantiated via $\mathfrak{G}$-equivariant Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs),
i.e., parametrized quantum circuits whose gates are generated by operators
commuting with a given representation of $\mathfrak{G}$. In practice, however,
there might be additional restrictions to the types of gates one can use, such

expressiveness for the special case of $\mathfrak{G}=S_n$, the symmetric group.
Our results show that if the QNN is generated by one- and two-body

the QNN can generate any arbitrary special unitary matrix in the invariant

theater -- presenting meaningless privacy protection as meaningful -- and
empowering more informed data-sharing decisions. Drawing on best practices in

the next vertex on its path, provided that the vertex is not occupied by
another agent. The goal is to find a sequence of such moves along the given
paths so that each reaches its target, or to report that no such sequence
exists. The problem models guidepath-based transport systems, which is a
pertinent abstraction for traffic in a variety of contemporary applications,
ranging from train networks or Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) in factories,
through computer game animations, to qubit transport in quantum computing. It
also arises as a sub-problem in the more general multi-robot motion-planning
problem.
  We provide a fine-grained tractability analysis of the problem by considering
new assumptions and identifying minimal values of key parameters for which the
problem remains NP-hard. Our analysis identifies a critical parameter called
vertex multiplicity (VM), defined as the maximum number of paths passing
through the same vertex. We show that a prevalent variant of the problem, which
is equivalent to Sequential Resource Allocation (concerning deadlock prevention
for concurrent processes), is NP-hard even when VM is 3. On the positive side,
for VM $\le$ 2 we give an efficient algorithm that iteratively resolves cycles
of blocking relations among agents. We also present a variant that is NP-hard
when the VM is 2 even when $G$ is a 2D grid and each path lies in a single grid
row or column. By studying highly distilled yet NP-hard variants, we deepen the
understanding of what makes the problem intractable and thereby guide the
search for efficient solutions under practical assumptions.

direct inferences of the present-day expansion rate, $H_0$. Early dark energy
(EDE), which briefly increases the cosmic expansion rate prior to
recombination, is a leading scenario for resolving this ""Hubble tension'' while
preserving a good fit to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. However, this
comes at the cost of changes in parameters that affect structure formation in
the late-time universe, including the spectral index of scalar perturbations,
$n_s$. Here, we present the first constraints on axion-like EDE using data from
the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest, i.e., absorption lines imprinted in background
quasar spectra by neutral hydrogen gas along the line of sight. We consider two
independent measurements of the one-dimensional Ly$\alpha$ forest flux power
spectrum, from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS eBOSS) and from the
MIKE/HIRES and X-Shooter spectrographs. We combine these with a baseline
dataset comprised of Planck CMB data and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO)
measurements. Combining the eBOSS Ly$\alpha$ data with the CMB and BAO dataset
reduces the 95\% upper bound on the maximum fractional contribution of EDE to
the cosmic energy budget, $f_{\rm EDE}$, from 0.08 to 0.03 and constrains
$H_0=67.9_{-0.4}^{+0.4}~{\rm km/s/Mpc}$ (68\% confidence level), with maximum a
posteriori value $H_0=67.9~{\rm km/s/Mpc}$. Similar results are obtained for
the MIKE/HIRES and X-Shooter Ly$\alpha$ data. Our Ly$\alpha$-based EDE
constraints yield $H_0$ values that are in $>4\sigma$ tension with the SH0ES
distance-ladder measurement and are driven by the preference of the Ly$\alpha$
forest data for $n_s$ values lower than those required by EDE cosmologies that
fit Planck CMB data. Taken at face value, the Ly$\alpha$ forest severely
constrains canonical EDE models that could resolve the Hubble tension.

Also, the onboard cameras perceive scenes without much overlapping. Thus,
existing NeRFs often produce blurs, 'floaters' and other artifacts on

star formation predicted a typical mass of around $\mathrm{ 100 \, M_\odot}$,
which conflicts with recent observations of extremely metal-poor stars
suggesting a lower mass scale of around $\mathrm{25 \, M_\odot}$. The
discrepancy may arise from unresolved turbulence in the Pop~III star-forming
cloud, driven by accreting primordial gas during mini-halo formation in the
previous simulation. To examine this turbulence effect, we use the adaptive
mesh refinement code $\texttt{Enzo}$ to model the Pop~III star-forming cloud,
including artificial-driven turbulence and relevant gas physics. This
artificial-driven turbulence uses a stochastic forcing model to mimic the
unresolved turbulence inside mini-halos. Our results show that strong,
compressive turbulence effectively fragments the cloud into several clumps,
each with dense cores of $\mathrm{22.7 - 174.9 \, M_\odot}$ that undergo Jeans
instability to form stars. With stronger and more compressive turbulence, more
clumps are formed, suggesting that turbulence can decrease the theoretical mass
scale of Pop~III stars and reconcile the mass discrepancy between simulations

search for many-body phases. Quantum technologies are mature enough to engineer
large photonic lattices with sophisticated structures coupled to quantum
emitters. In this context, a fundamental problem is to find general criteria to
tailor a photonic environment that mediates a desired effective Hamiltonian of
the atoms. Among these criteria, topological properties are of utmost
importance since an effective atomic Hamiltonian endowed with a non-trivial
topology can be protected against disorder and imperfections. Here, we find
general theorems that govern the topological properties (if any) of
photon-mediated Hamiltonians in terms of both Hermitian and non-Hermitian
topological invariants, thus unveiling a system-bath topological
correspondence. The results depend on the number of emitters relative to the
number of resonators. For a photonic lattice where each mode is coupled to a
single quantum emitter, the Altland-Zirnbauer classification of topological
insulators allows us to link the topology of the atoms to that of the photonic
bath: we unveil the phenomena of topological preservation and reversal to the
effect that the atomic topology can be the same or opposite to the photonic
one, depending on Hermiticity of the photonic system and on the parity of the
spatial dimension. As a consequence, the bulk-edge correspondence implies the
existence of atomic boundary modes with the group velocity opposite to the
photonic ones in a 2D Hermitian topological system. If there are fewer emitters
than photonic modes, the atomic system is less constrained and no general
photon-atom topological correspondence can be found. We show this with two

nuclei post merger (up to 3rd peak and actinides, $A\sim200-240$), after
accounting for the volumetric event rates. Magnetorotational (MR) CCSNe likely
undergo a weak r-process (up to $A\sim140$) and contribute to the production of
light element primary process (LEPP) nuclei, whereas typical thermal,
neutrino-driven CCSNe only synthesize up to 1st r-process peak nuclei
($A\sim80-90$). We also find that the upper limit to the rate of MR CCSNe is

weak r-process nuclei would be overproduced. Although the largest uncertainty
is from the volumetric event rate, the prospects are encouraging for confirming
these rates in the next few years with upcoming surveys. Using a simple model

the properties of the merging BH population, and its differences with the
underlying global BH population in terms of BH and galaxy properties. We
calculate in post-processing dynamical delays between the merger in the
simulation at the resolution limit and the actual coalescence well below the
resolution scale. We find that merging BHs are hosted in relatively massive
galaxies with stellar mass $M_\ast\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$. Given that galaxy mass
is correlated with other BH and galaxy properties, BH mergers tend to also have
higher total BH mass and higher BH accretion rates than the global population
of main BHs. These differences generally disappear if the merger population is
compared with a BH population sampled with the same galaxy mass distribution as
merger hosts. Galaxy mergers can temporarily boost the BH accretion rate and
the host's star formation rate, which can remain active at the BH merger if
sub-resolution delays are not taken into account. When dynamical delays are
taken into account the burst has generally faded by the time the BHs merge. BH
spins are followed self-consistently in the simulation, under the effect of
accretion and BH mergers. We find that merging BHs have higher spins than the

traps. These dust traps set the chemical composition of the planet forming
material in these disks, as the dust grains with their icy mantles are trapped
at specific radii and could deplete the gas and dust of volatiles at smaller
radii. In this work we analyse the first detection of nitric oxide (NO) in a
protoplanetary disk. We aim to constrain the nitrogen chemistry and the
gas-phase C/O ratio in the highly asymmetric dust trap in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
We use ALMA observations of NO, CN, C$_2$H, and related molecules and model the
effect of the dust trap on the physical and chemical structure using the
thermochemical code DALI. Furthermore, we explore how ice sublimation
contributes to the observed emission lines. NO is only observed at the location
of the dust trap but CN and C$_2$H are not detected in the Oph-IRS 48 disk.
This results in an CN/NO column density ratio of $< 0.05$ and thus a low C/O
ratio at the location of the dust trap. The main gas-phase formation pathways
to NO through OH and NH in the fiducial model predict NO emission that is an
order of magnitude lower than is observed. The gaseous NO column density can be
increased by factors ranging from 2.8 to 10 when the H$_2$O and NH$_3$ gas
abundances are significantly boosted by ice sublimation. However, these models
are inconsistent with the upper limits on the H$_2$O and OH column densities
derived from observations. We propose that the NO emission in the Oph-IRS 48
disk is closely related to the nitrogen containing ices sublimating in the dust
trap. The non-detection of CN constrains the C/O ratio both inside and outside
the dust trap to be $< 1$ if all nitrogen initially starts as N$_2$ and $\leq
0.6$, consistent with the Solar value, if (part of) the nitrogen initially
starts as N or NH$_3$.

cosmological simulations. We search for galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing systems in
HST multi-band imaging of galaxy cluster cores from the CLASH and HFF programs
by exploring the classification capabilities of deep learning techniques.
Convolutional neural networks are trained utilising highly-realistic
simulations of galaxy-scale strong lenses injected into the HST cluster fields
around cluster members. To this aim, we take advantage of extensive
spectroscopic information on member galaxies in 16 clusters and the accurate
knowledge of the deflection fields in half of these from high-precision strong
lensing models. Using observationally-based distributions, we sample
magnitudes, redshifts and sizes of the background galaxy population. By placing
these sources within the secondary caustics associated with cluster galaxies,
we build a sample of ~3000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses which preserve the full
complexity of real multi-colour data and produce a wide diversity of strong
lensing configurations. We study two deep learning networks processing a large
sample of image cutouts in three HST/ACS bands, and we quantify their
classification performance using several standard metrics. We find that both
networks achieve a very good trade-off between purity and completeness
(85%-95%), as well as good stability with fluctuations within 2%-4%. We
characterise the limited number of false negatives and false positives in terms
of the physical properties of the background sources and cluster members. We
also demonstrate the neural networks' high degree of generalisation by applying
our method to HST observations of 12 clusters with previously known

NED01, hosts a Seyfert 1.9 nucleus launching a powerful X-ray UFO. Our X-ray
spectral analysis suggests the UFO could be variable or multi-component in
velocity and constrains its momentum flux to $\dot p^{X-ray}_{out} \sim

both sources, we can model the bulk of the CO(1-0) emission with rotating disks
and, after subtracting the best-fit models, we detect compact residual emission
at S/N=15 within $\sim3$kpc from the centre. A molecular outflow in NED01, if
present, cannot be brighter than such residuals, implying an upper limit on its
outflow rate of $\dot{M}^{mol}_{out} \lesssim 19\pm14~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ and on
its momentum rate of $\dot p^{mol}_{out} \lesssim (2.7\pm2.4) \times

derive an upper limit on the momentum rate ratio of

the context of the expectations of AGN feedback models, and we propose the
X-ray disk wind in NED01 has not significantly impacted the molecular gas
reservoir (yet), and we can constrain its effect to be much smaller than
expectations of AGN ''energy-driven'' feedback models. We also consider and

The breakdown of the correspondence originates from the perturbation in the

can be understood by the wormhole effect in the path integral representation of
reduced density matrix. Our study generalizes the established correspondence

improved protocols/policies for entanglement distribution along a linear chain
of nodes, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous, that take practical limitations
such as photon losses, non-ideal measurements, and quantum memories with short
coherence times into account. For a wide range of parameters, our policies
improve upon previously known policies, such as the
``swap-as-soon-as-possible'' policy, with respect to both the waiting time and
the fidelity of the end-to-end entanglement. This improvement is greatest for
the most practically relevant cases, namely, for short coherence times, high
link losses, and highly asymmetric links. To obtain our results, we model
entanglement distribution using a Markov decision process, and then we use the
Q-learning reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to discover new policies.
These new policies are characterized by dynamic, state-dependent memory cutoffs
and collaboration between the nodes. In particular, we quantify this
collaboration between the nodes. Our quantifiers tell us how much ``global''
knowledge of the network every node has. Finally, our understanding of the
performance of large quantum networks is currently limited by the computational
inefficiency of simulating them using RL or other optimization methods. Thus,
in this work, we present a method for nesting policies in order to obtain
policies for large repeater chains. By nesting our RL-based policies for small
repeater chains, we obtain policies for large repeater chains that improve upon
the swap-as-soon-as-possible policy, and thus we pave the way for a scalable
method for obtaining policies for long-distance entanglement distribution.

single-objective MILP. We demonstrate that the EF of the multiobjective MILP is
comprised of points on the boundary of the epigraph of the RVF so that any

part of the paper, we describe the mathematical structure of the RVF, including
characterizing the set of points at which it is differentiable, the gradients
at such points, and the subdifferential at all nondifferentiable points.
Because of the close relationship of the RVF to the EF, we observe that methods
for constructing so-called value functions and methods for constructing the EF
of a multiobjective optimization problem, each of which have been developed in
separate communities, are effectively interchangeable. By exploiting this
relationship, we propose a generalized cutting plane algorithm for constructing
the EF of a multiobjective MILP based on a generalization of an existing

at red wavelengths. This is the highest intrinsic polarization recorded for a

The apparent wavelength dependence of the polarization may arise through
depolarization or dilution of the polarized flux, due to conditions in
AT~2018cow at early times. A second ``bump"" in the polarization is observed at
blue wavelengths at ~12 days. Such a high polarization requires an extremely
aspherical geometry that is only apparent for a brief period (<1 day), such as
shock breakout through an optically thick disk. For a disk-like configuration,
the ratio of the thickness to radial extent must be ~10%.

present the analysis of our deep (~261 ks) X-ray Chandra ACIS-S observations of

more extended at lower energies, in the bicone direction out to ~2 kpc

energies 3-6 keV. The nuclear spectrum suggests a low photoionization phase
mixed with a more ionized gas component, while the bicone and cross-cone
spectra are dominated by a mix of photoionization and shocked gas emission. A
mixture of thermal and photoionization models to fit the spectra indicates the
presence of complex gas interactions, consistent with previous observations of
other CT AGN (e.g., ESO 428-G014).

information from continuous streams of data. Streaming applications usually run
in dedicated Stream Processing Engines (SPEs) that adopt the DataFlow model,
which defines such applications as graphs of operators that, step by step,
transform data into the desired results. As operators can be deployed and
executed independently, the DataFlow model supports parallelism and
distribution, thus making streaming applications scalable.
  Today, we witness an abundance of SPEs, each with its set of operators. In
this context, understanding how operators' semantics overlap within and across
SPEs, and thus which SPEs can support a given application, is not trivial. We
tackle this problem by formally showing that common operators of SPEs can be
expressed as compositions of a single, minimalistic Aggregate operator, thus
showing any framework able to run compositions of such an operator can run
applications defined for state-of-the-art SPEs. The Aggregate operator only
relies on core concepts of the DataFlow model such as data partitioning by key
and time-based windows, and can only output up to one value for each window it
analyzes. Together with our formal argumentation, we empirically assess how an
SPE that only relies on such an operator compares with an SPE offering
operator-specific implementations, as well as study the performance impact of a
more expressive Aggregate operator by relaxing the constraint of outputting up
to one value per window.
  The existence of such a common denominator not only implies the portability
of operators within and across SPEs but also defines a concise set of
requirements for other data processing frameworks to support streaming
applications.

symmetry in the layer midplane, including binary fluid convection. We use
numerical continuation, together with extensive direct numerical simulations,
to study SH35 with an additional nonvariational quadratic term to model the
effects of breaking the midplane reflection symmetry. The nonvariational
structure of the model leads to the propagation of asymmetric spatially
localized structures (LSs). An asymptotic prediction for the drift velocity of
such structures is validated numerically. Next, we present an extensive study
of possible collision scenarios between identical and nonidentical traveling
structures, varying a temperature-like control parameter. The final state may
be a simple bound state of the initial LSs or longer or shorter than the sum of
the two initial states as a result of nonlinear interactions. The Maxwell point
of the variational system is shown to have no bearing on which of these
scenarios is realized. Instead, we argue that the stability properties of bound
states are key. While individual LSs lie on a modified snakes-and-ladders
structure in the nonvariational SH35, the multi-pulse bound states resulting
from collisions lie on isolas in parameter space. In the gradient SH35, such
isolas are always of figure-eight shape, but in the present non-gradient case
they are generically more complex, some of which terminate in T-point
bifurcations. A reduced model consisting of two coupled ordinary differential
equations is proposed to describe the linear interactions between the tails of
the LSs in which the model parameters are deduced using gradient descent
optimization. For collisions leading to the formation of simple bound states,
the reduced model reproduces the trajectories of LSs with high quantitative
accuracy.

to plan an intervention schedule that maximizes the expected reward while
satisfying budget constraints on each worker as well as fairness in terms of
the load assigned to each worker. Our contributions are two-fold: (1) we
provide a multi-worker extension of the Whittle index to tackle heterogeneous

address this challenge, we develop and motivate a method for using large
language models (LLMs) to generate large numbers of synthetic queries cheaply.
The method begins by generating a small number of synthetic queries using an
expensive LLM. After that, a much less expensive one is used to create large
numbers of synthetic queries, which are used to fine-tune a family of reranker
models. These rerankers are then distilled into a single efficient retriever
for use in the target domain. We show that this technique boosts zero-shot
accuracy in long-tail domains, even where only 2K synthetic queries are used
for fine-tuning, and that it achieves substantially lower latency than standard
reranking methods. We make our end-to-end approach, including our synthetic
datasets and replication code, publicly available on Github:

atmosphere. We explain how greenhouse gases like water vapor or carbon dioxide,
differ from non-greenhouse gases like nitrogen or oxygen. Using simple
thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, we show that a planet with sufficiently
high concentrations of greenhouse gases must develop a convecting troposphere.
The planet must also develop a non-convecting stratosphere above the
tropopause. In the simplest approximation of an atmosphere that is transparent
to sunlight and has frequency-independent opacity for thermal radiation, one
can find simple formulas for the tropopause altitude, and for the altitude
profiles of pressure and temperature. The troposphere is nearly isentropic and
the stratosphere is nearly isothermal. Earth's real atmosphere is much more
complicated but it does have a troposphere and a stratosphere. Between the
surface and the tropopause the entropy per kilogram of real tropospheric air
increases slowly with altitude. The entropy increases much more rapidly with
altitude in the stratosphere. The stratosphere has a nearly isothermal lower
part and a hotter upper part due to absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation
by ozone. The thermal opacity of the real atmosphere has a complicated
frequency dependence due to the hundreds of thousands of vibration-rotation
transitions of its greenhouse molecules. Unlike the simple model where nearly
all radiation to space originates at the tropopause altitude, radiation to
space from Earth's real atmosphere originates from both the surface and all
altitudes in the troposphere. A small additional amount of radiation originates
in the stratosphere. When these complications are taken into account, model
calculations of the thermal radiation spectrum at the top of the atmosphere can
hardly be distinguished from satellite observations.

show a framework that reduces negative-weight SSSP in either setting to
$n^{o(1)}$ calls to any SSSP algorithm that works with a virtual source. More
specifically, for a graph with $m$ edges, $n$ vertices, undirected hop-diameter

  Using current state-of-the-art SSSP algorithms yields randomized algorithms

  Our main technical contribution is an efficient reduction for computing a
low-diameter decomposition (LDD) of directed graphs to computations of SSSP

known for undirected graphs in both the parallel and distributed models. The

dynamically measuring the planet's angular momentum by means of the
Lense-Thirring effect affecting a putative Uranian orbiter. It is possible, at
least in principle, to separate the relativistic precessions of the orbital
inclination to the Celestial Equator and of the longitude of the ascending node
of the spacecraft from its classical rates of the pericentre induced by the
multipoles of the planet's gravity field by adopting an appropriate orbital
configuration. For a wide and elliptical $2\,000\times 100\,000\,\mathrm{km}$
orbit, the gravitomagnetic signatures amount to tens of milliarcseconds per
year, while, for a suitable choice of the initial conditions, the peak-to-peak
amplitude of the range-rate shift can reach the level of $\simeq 1.5\times
10^{-3}$ millimetre per second in a single pericentre passage of a few hours.
By lowering the apocentre height to $10\,000\,\mathrm{km}$, the Lense-Thirring
precessions are enhanced to the level of hundreds of milliarcseconds per year.
The uncertainties in the orientation of the planetary spin axis and in the
inclination are major sources of systematic bias; it turns out that they should
be determined with accuracies as good as $\simeq 0.1-1$ and $\simeq 1-10$
milliarcseconds, respectively.

carries considerable energy and deposits it on the host galaxy at kiloparsec
scales and beyond, heating the galactic gas thereby quenching star formation.
Our model predicts that the typical LLAGN can quench more than $10\%$ of star
formation in its host galaxy. We find that long-lived LLAGN winds from
supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses $\geq 10^8 M_{\odot}$ and mass
accretion rates $\dot{M} > 10^{-3}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ can prevent gas collapse
and significantly quench galactic star formation compared to a scenario without
AGN, if the wind persists over 1 Myr. For sustained wind production over
timescales of 10 Myr or longer, SMBHs with $10^8 M_{\odot}$ or larger masses
have important feedback effects with $\dot{M} > 10^{-4} \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$.

\subseteq V(G)$ and edge capacities $cap: E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$. By an
odd $T$-walk we mean a walk in $G$ (with possible vertex and edge
self-intersections) connecting two distinct terminals and consisting of an odd
number of edges. Inspired by the work of Schrijver and Seymour on odd path
packing for two terminals, we consider packings of odd $T$-walks subject to
capacities $cap$.
  First, we present a strongly polynomial time algorithm for constructing a
maximum fractional packing of odd $T$-walks. For even integer capacities, our
algorithm constructs a packing that is half-integer. Additionally, if
$cap(\delta(v))$ is divisible by 4 for any $v \in V(G) - T$, our algorithm
constructs an integer packing.
  Second, we establish and prove the corresponding min-max relation.
  Third, if $G$ is inner Eulerian (i.e. degrees of all nodes in $V(G) - T$ are
even) and $cap(e) = 2$ for all $e \in E$, we show that there exists an integer
packing of odd $T$-trails (i.e. odd $T$-walks with no repeated edges) of the
same value as in case of odd $T$-walks, and this packing can be found in
polynomial time.
  To achieve the above goals, we establish a connection between packings of odd
$T$-walks and $T$-trails and certain multiflow problems in undirected and
bidirected graphs.

synthetic observations, we generate ensembles of plausible initial conditions
using a latent diffusion model. We modify the original, two-dimensional latent
diffusion model code to work on three-dimensional turbulent fields. The
algorithm produces realistic and diverse samples that successfully run when
inserted into a large-eddy simulation code. The samples have physically
plausible turbulent structures on large and moderate spatial scales in the

vicinity of observations while having higher variability further from the
observations, matching expected behavior. Ensembles demonstrate near-zero bias
relative to ground truth in the vicinity of observations, but rank histogram
analysis suggests that ensembles have too little member-to-member variability
when compared to an ideal ensemble. Given the success of the latent diffusion
model, the generated ensembles will be tested in their ability to recreate a
time history of the atmosphere when coupled to an ensemble-based data
assimilation algorithm in upcoming work. We find that diffusion models show

learning methods are often based on probabilistic outputs of abstract nature,
which are difficult to translate into interpretable measures. For example, the
Global Human Settlement Layer GHS-BUILT-S2 product reports the probability of
the presence of built-up areas in 2018 in a global 10 m x 10 m grid. However,
practitioners typically require interpretable measures such as binary surfaces
indicating the presence or absence of built-up areas or estimates of sub-pixel
built-up surface fractions. Herein, we assess the relationship between the
built-up probability in GHS-BUILT-S2 and reference built-up surface fractions
derived from a highly reliable reference database for several regions in the
United States. Furthermore, we identify a binarization threshold using an
agreement maximization method that creates binary built-up land data from these
built-up probabilities. These binary surfaces are input to a spatially
explicit, scale-sensitive accuracy assessment which includes the use of a
novel, visual-analytical tool which we call focal precision-recall signature
plots. Our analysis reveals that a threshold of 0.5 applied to GHS-BUILT-S2
maximizes the agreement with binarized built-up land data derived from the
reference built-up area fraction. We find high levels of accuracy (i.e.,
county-level F-1 scores of almost 0.8 on average) in the derived built-up
areas, and consistently high accuracy along the rural-urban gradient in our
study area. These results reveal considerable accuracy improvements in human

diffusion models are optimized with non-uniform weighting due to better results
in terms of sample quality. In this work we expose a direct relationship
between the weighted loss (with any weighting) and the ELBO objective.
  We show that the weighted loss can be written as a weighted integral of

then the weighted loss is a likelihood-based objective: it maximizes the ELBO
under simple data augmentation, namely Gaussian noise perturbation. Our main
contribution is a deeper theoretical understanding of the diffusion objective,

weightings, finding that monotonic weighting performs competitively with the

population rather than a certain number of samples, and leads to increasing
requirement for privacy protection. Local differential privacy (LDP) is an
effective standard of privacy measurement; however, its large variance of mean
estimation causes challenges in application. To address this problem, this
paper presents a new LDP approach, an improved Christofides mechanism.
  It compared four statistical survey methods for conducting surveys on
sensitive topics -- modified Warner, Simmons, Christofides, and the improved
Christofides mechanism. Specifically, Warner, Simmons and Christofides
mechanisms have been modified to draw a sample from the population without
replacement, to decrease variance. Furthermore, by drawing cards without
replacement based on modified Christofides mechanism, we introduce a new
mechanism called the improved Christofides mechanism, which is found to have
the smallest variance under certain assumption when using LDP as a measurement
of privacy leakage. The assumption is do satisfied usually in the real world.
Actually, we decrease the variance to 28.7% of modified Christofides
mechanism's variance in our experiment based on the HCOVANY dataset -- a real
world dataset of IPUMS USA. This means our method gets a more accurate estimate
by using LDP as a measurement of privacy leakage. This is the first time the
improved Christofides mechanism is proposed for LDP framework based on
comparative analysis of four mechanisms using LDP as the same measurement of

materials poses significant challenges in geotechnical engineering. These
challenges arise due to differences in material stiffnesses, the interaction
between multiple phases, high bulk modulus of pore fluid, and low permeability.
The conventional explicit time integration scheme is limited by its conditional
stability, necessitating small time step sizes and resulting in pressure
oscillations under rapid loading conditions. To address these issues, we
propose a stable two-phase contact algorithm within the Material Point Method
(MPM) framework for soil-structure interaction problems. Our algorithm models
the soil as a fully saturated porous media with incompressible pore fluid. We
introduce three main advancements over conventional MPM methods. We employ
Chorin's projection method to solve coupled formulations and reduce numerical
oscillations. By implicitly handling a diffusion term, our algorithm permits
larger stable time step sizes, independent of the bulk modulus and permeability
of the pore fluid. Lastly, We integrate a rigid algorithm to model solid bodies
accurately and a precise contact detection algorithm. We provide detailed
formulations and time increment processes of the two-phase contact MPM
algorithm. Furthermore, we compare the proposed algorithm with Finite Element
Method (FEM) and explicit MPM to assess its accuracy and performance in
simulating coupled hydro-mechanical problems. The two-phase contact algorithm
offers a more stable and efficient approach to simulate soil-structure
interaction problems.

study the orbital evolution of weakly eccentric or inclined low-mass
protoplanets embedded in gaseous discs subject to thermal diffusion. We
consider both non-luminous planets, and planets that also experience the
radiative feedback from their own luminosity. We compare our results to
previous analytical work, and find that thermal forces (the contribution to the
disc's force arising from thermal effects) match those predicted by linear
theory within $\sim 20$%. When the planet's luminosity exceeds a threshold
found to be within $10$% of that predicted by linear theory, its eccentricity
and inclination grow exponentially, whereas these quantities undergo a strong
damping below this threshold. In this regime of low luminosity indeed, thermal
diffusion cools the surroundings of the planet and allows gas to accumulate in
its vicinity. It is the dynamics of this gas excess that contributes to damp
eccentricity and inclination. The damping rates obtained can be up to $h^{-1}$
times larger than those due to the resonant interaction with the disc, where
$h$ is the disc's aspect ratio. This suggests that models that incorporate
planet-disc interactions using well-known formulae based on resonant
wave-launching to describe the evolution of eccentricity and inclination
underestimate the damping action of the disc on the eccentricity and

prepared datasets that may not adequately reflect the type of data that occurs
in industry settings. In our research, at a major financial services company,
privacy concerns prevented inspection of the bodies of emails and attachment
details (although subject headings and attachment filenames were available).
This made labeling possible anomalies in the resulting redacted emails more
difficult. Another source of difficulty is the high volume of emails combined
with the scarcity of resources making machine learning (ML) a necessity, but
also creating a need for more efficient human training of ML models. Active
learning (AL) has been proposed as a way to make human training of ML models
more efficient. However, the implementation of Active Learning methods is a
human-centered AI challenge due to potential human analyst uncertainty, and the
labeling task can be further complicated in domains such as the cybersecurity
domain (or healthcare, aviation, etc.) where mistakes in labeling can have
highly adverse consequences. In this paper we present research results
concerning the application of Active Learning to anomaly detection in redacted
emails, comparing the utility of different methods for implementing active
learning in this context. We evaluate different AL strategies and their impact
on resulting model performance. We also examine how ratings of confidence that
experts have in their labels can inform AL. The results obtained are discussed
in terms of their implications for AL methodology and for the role of experts
in model-assisted email anomaly screening.

and a sampling based method to select the best state value, based on optimizing
a prescribed finite-horizon performance function, over the available candidates
provided by a particle filter. The cost function is minimized over the horizon

the minimization is performed not over the selection of the control other than

reduces to a quadratic program for the state value. The algorithm is evaluated

applications such as large-scale language modeling to mitigate exploding
gradients. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated a fairly special
behavior in the smoothness of the training objective along its trajectory when
trained with gradient clipping. That is, the smoothness grows with the gradient
norm. This is in clear contrast to the well-established assumption in folklore
non-convex optimization, a.k.a. $L$--smoothness, where the smoothness is
assumed to be bounded by a constant $L$ globally. The recently introduced
$(L_0,L_1)$--smoothness is a more relaxed notion that captures such behavior in
non-convex optimization. In particular, it has been shown that under this
relaxed smoothness assumption, SGD with clipping requires $O(\epsilon^{-4})$
stochastic gradient computations to find an $\epsilon$--stationary solution. In
this paper, we employ a variance reduction technique, namely SPIDER, and
demonstrate that for a carefully designed learning rate, this complexity is
improved to $O(\epsilon^{-3})$ which is order-optimal. Our designed learning
rate comprises the clipping technique to mitigate the growing smoothness.
Moreover, when the objective function is the average of $n$ components, we
improve the existing $O(n\epsilon^{-2})$ bound on the stochastic gradient
complexity to $O(\sqrt{n} \epsilon^{-2} + n)$, which is order-optimal as well.
In addition to being theoretically optimal, SPIDER with our designed parameters
demonstrates comparable empirical performance against variance-reduced methods
such as SVRG and SARAH in several vision tasks.

Then, the processed images are input into GBH-YOLOv5, and the depth features

and cost, while vision-based methods require stereo setup and struggle to
achieve real-time performance. This paper proposes the first eye-to-hand
monocular approach to continuum robot shape sensing. Utilizing a deep
encoder-decoder network, our method, MoSSNet, eliminates the computation cost
of stereo matching and reduces requirements on sensing hardware. In particular,
MoSSNet comprises an encoder and three parallel decoders to uncover spatial,
length, and contour information from a single RGB image, and then obtains the
3D shape through curve fitting. A two-segment tendon-driven continuum robot is
used for data collection and testing, demonstrating accurate (mean shape error
of 0.91 mm, or 0.36% of robot length) and real-time (70 fps) shape sensing on
real-world data. Additionally, the method is optimized end-to-end and does not
require fiducial markers, manual segmentation, or camera calibration. Code and

careful design to, for example, maintain the safety of participants, use
resources efficiently and allow clinically meaningful conclusions to be drawn.
Adaptive clinical trials (i.e. trials that can be altered based on evidence
that has accrued) are often more efficient, informative and ethical than
standard or non-adaptive trials because they require fewer participants, target
more promising treatments, and can stop early with sufficient evidence of
effectiveness or harm. The design of adaptive trials requires the
pre-specification of adaptions that are permissible throughout the conduct of
the trial. Proposed adaptive designs are then usually evaluated through
simulation which provides indicative metrics of performance (e.g. statistical
power and type-1 error) under different scenarios. Trial simulation requires
assumptions about the data generating process to be specified but correctly
specifying these in practice can be difficult, particularly for new and
emerging diseases. To address this, we propose an approach to design adaptive
clinical trials without needing to specify the complete data generating
process. To facilitate this, we consider a general Bayesian framework where
inference about the treatment effect on a time-to-event outcome can be
performed via the partial likelihood. As a consequence, the proposed approach
to evaluate trial designs is robust to the specific form of the baseline hazard
function. The benefits of this approach are demonstrated through the redesign
of a recent clinical trial to evaluate whether a third dose of a vaccine

However, no study analyzed the impact of data persistence bias on social media

analyze the data persistence and the bias it introduces on the datasets of
three types: controversial topics, trending topics, and framing of issues. We
report which topics are more likely to suffer from data persistence among these
datasets. We quantify the data persistence bias using the change in political
orientation, the presence of potentially harmful content and topics as
measures. We found that controversial datasets are more likely to suffer from
data persistence and they lean towards the political left upon recollection.
The turnout of the data that contain potentially harmful content is
significantly lower on non-controversial datasets. Overall, we found that the

  during local flame-flame interaction",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Given the need to develop zero-carbon combustors for power and aircraft
engine applications, $S_d$ of a turbulent premixed flame, especially for
H$_2$-air, is of immediate interest. The present study investigates 3D DNS
cases of premixed H$_2$-air turbulent flames at varied pressures for different
$Re_t$ and $Ka$ with detailed chemistry to theoretically model $S_d$ at
negative curvatures. Prior studies at atmospheric pressure showed
$\widetilde{S_d}$ to be enhanced significantly over $S_L$ at large negative
$\kappa$ due to flame-flame interactions. 1D simulations of an imploding
cylindrical H$_2$-air laminar premixed flame used to represent the local flame
surfaces undergoing flame-flame interaction in a turbulent flame at the
corresponding pressure conditions are performed to understand the interaction
dynamics. These simulations emphasized the transient nature of the flame
structure during flame-flame interactions and enabled analytical modeling of
$\widetilde{S_d}$ at these regions of extreme negative $\kappa$ of the 3D DNS.
The JPDF of $\widetilde{S_d}$ and $\kappa$ and the corresponding conditional
averages from 3D DNS showed a negative correlation between $\widetilde{S_d}$
and $\kappa$. The model successfully predicts the variation of
$\langle\widetilde{S_d}|_{\kappa}\rangle$ with $\kappa$ for the regions on the
flame surface with $\kappa\delta_L \! \ll \! -1$ at all pressures, with good
accuracy. This shows the aforementioned configuration to be fruitful in
representing local flame-flame interaction in 3D turbulent flames. Moreover, at
$\kappa=0$, on average $\widetilde{S_d}$ can deviate from $S_L$, manifested by
the internal flame structure, controlled by turbulence transport in the large
$Ka$ regime. Thus, the correlation of $\langle\widetilde{S_d}\rangle/S_L$ with
$\langle|\widehat{\nabla c}|_{c_0}\rangle$ at $\kappa =0$ is explored.

multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms to be applied to
real-world problems typically involving massively many agents. For this,
parameter sharing across multiple agents has widely been used since it reduces
the training time by decreasing the number of parameters and increasing the
sample efficiency. However, using the same parameters across agents limits the
representational capacity of the joint policy and consequently, the performance
can be degraded in multi-agent tasks that require different behaviors for
different agents. In this paper, we propose a simple method that adopts
structured pruning for a deep neural network to increase the representational
capacity of the joint policy without introducing additional parameters. We
evaluate the proposed method on several benchmark tasks, and numerical results

results from imperfect photon-baryon coupling in the pre-recombination plasma.
At redshift $5 \times 10^4 < z < 2 \times 10^6$, the plasma acquires an
effective chemical potential, and energy injections from acoustic damping in
this era create $\mu$-type spectral distortions of the CMB. These $\mu$
distortions trace the underlying photon density fluctuations, probing the
primordial power spectrum in short-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{S}$ over the
range $50 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \lesssim k \lesssim 10^4 \ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$.
Small-scale power modulated by long-wavelength modes $k_\mathrm{L}$ from
squeezed-limit non-Gaussianities introduces cross-correlations between CMB
temperature anisotropies and $\mu$ distortions. Under single-field inflation
models, $\mu \times T$ correlations measured from an observer in an inertial
frame should vanish up to a factor of $(k_\mathrm{L}/k_\mathrm{S})^2 \ll 1$.
Thus, any measurable correlation rules out single-field inflation models. We
forecast how well the next-generation ground-based CMB experiment CMB-S4 will
be able to constrain primordial squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity, parameterized
by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, using measurements of $C_{\ell}^{\mu T}$ as well as
$C_{\ell}^{\mu E}$ from CMB $E$ modes. Using current experimental
specifications and foreground modeling, we expect $\sigma(f_\mathrm{NL})
\lesssim 1000$. This is roughly four times better than the current limit on
$f_\mathrm{NL}$ using $\mu \times T$ and $\mu \times E$ correlations from
Planck and is comparable to what is achievable with LiteBIRD, demonstrating the
power of the CMB-S4 experiment. This measurement is at an effective scale of $k
\simeq 740 \ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ and is thus highly complementary to measurements
at larger scales from primary CMB and large-scale structure.

We compare the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of import shocks
occurring to different crops and analyze the shock intensity and shock recovery
in various continents based on locally weighted polynomial regression and
Cook's distance. The results reveal higher frequencies during the 2007/2008
food crisis and relatively higher shock frequencies in North America, Africa,

majority of shocks in Asia recovering in the short term. We also find that high
import diversity and a low import dependency ratio buffer economies against
import shocks, resulting in a low shock rate and a high recovery rate. These
results contribute to our understanding of the external supply risks of food,

during slip events to develop distinctive features and formulates slip
detection as a classification problem. To evaluate our approach, we test
multiple data-driven models on 10 common objects under different loading

difficulty of distinguishing propagating surface spin waves along the opposite

realize unidirectional microwave transduction with sub-micron-wavelength
propagating magnons in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) thin film delay line. We
achieve a non-decaying isolation of 30 dB with a broad field-tunable band-pass
frequency range up to 14 GHz. The large isolation is due to the selection of
chiral magnetostatic surface spin waves with the Oersted field generated from
the coplanar waveguide antenna. Increasing the geometry ratio between the
antenna width and YIG thickness drastically reduces the nonreciprocity and
introduces additional magnon transmission bands. Our results pave the way for

grasping from a point cloud observation under a table-top setting. The goal is
to grasp and lift up objects in high-quality and diverse ways and generalize
across hundreds of categories and even the unseen. Inspired by successful
pipelines used in parallel gripper grasping, we split the task into two stages:
1) grasp proposal (pose) generation and 2) goal-conditioned grasp execution.
For the first stage, we propose a novel probabilistic model of grasp pose
conditioned on the point cloud observation that factorizes rotation from
translation and articulation. Trained on our synthesized large-scale dexterous
grasp dataset, this model enables us to sample diverse and high-quality
dexterous grasp poses for the object point cloud.For the second stage, we
propose to replace the motion planning used in parallel gripper grasping with a
goal-conditioned grasp policy, due to the complexity involved in dexterous
grasping execution. Note that it is very challenging to learn this highly
generalizable grasp policy that only takes realistic inputs without oracle
states. We thus propose several important innovations, including state
canonicalization, object curriculum, and teacher-student distillation.
Integrating the two stages, our final pipeline becomes the first to achieve
universal generalization for dexterous grasping, demonstrating an average
success rate of more than 60\% on thousands of object instances, which
significantly outperforms all baselines, meanwhile showing only a minimal
generalization gap.

post-data acquisition process for classifying the ALTM's dense and irregular

efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a novel deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) technique for achieving voxel-based semantic segmentation of the ALTM's
point clouds. The suggested deep learning method, Semantic Utility Network
(SUNet) is a multi-dimensional and multi-resolution network. SUNet combines two
networks: one classifies point clouds at multi-resolution with object
categories in three dimensions and another predicts two-dimensional regional
labels distinguishing corridor regions from non-corridors. A significant
innovation of the SUNet is that it imposes spatial layout consistency on the
outcomes of voxel-based and regional segmentation results. The proposed
multi-dimensional DCNN combines hierarchical context for spatial layout
embedding with a coarse-to-fine strategy. We conducted a comprehensive ablation

management and treatment. However, existing works focus on segmentation and

of the previous work considers using lesion prevalence-related non-imaging
patient information to assist the differential diagnosis. To this end, we
develop a meta-information-aware dual-path transformer and exploit the
feasibility of classification and segmentation of the full taxonomy of
pancreatic lesions. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a CNN-based
segmentation path (S-path) and a transformer-based classification path
(C-path). The S-path focuses on initial feature extraction by semantic
segmentation using a UNet-based network. The C-path utilizes both the extracted
features and meta-information for patient-level classification based on stacks
of dual-path transformer blocks that enhance the modeling of global contextual
information. A large-scale multi-phase CT dataset of 3,096 patients with
pathology-confirmed pancreatic lesion class labels, voxel-wise manual
annotations of lesions from radiologists, and patient meta-information, was
collected for training and evaluations. Our results show that our method can
enable accurate classification and segmentation of the full taxonomy of
pancreatic lesions, approaching the accuracy of the radiologist's report and

histopathology-specialized deep network, and to extract a multitude of feature

strategy guided by the classification accuracy and the number of features. In
the second stage, the frequent features histogram (FFH), a novel WSI
representation, is constructed by multiple runs of coarse LSMOP. Fine
evolutionary feature selection is then applied to find a compact (short-length)
feature vector based on the FFH and contributes to a more robust deep-learning
approach to digital pathology supported by the stochastic power of evolutionary
algorithms. We validate the proposed schemes using The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) images in terms of WSI representation, classification accuracy, and
feature quality. Furthermore, a novel decision space for multicriteria decision

nuclei using the available model-independent data for the charge density and
the recent development of Coulomb energy-density functional. Within the
Woods-Saxon potential as a nuclear component, we are able to quantify the
differences in proton single-particle energies due to the differences from the
model-independent data of the uniform distribution, the two-parameter Fermi
function, as well as the charge density obtained from a microscopic
Hartree-Fock calculation using the effective Skyrme interaction. The obtained
energy differences are generally small in magnitude, namely about 100~keV or
less if the parameters of the charge density models are appropriately
determined. Considerable larger differences appear when the last occupied state
is highly filled and, at the same time, has a small orbital angular momentum.
Sulfur isotopes ($Z=16$) are a perfect example of these nuclei. Unfortunately,
despite its simplicity, the uniform distribution cannot be used for evaluating
the Coulomb exchange term within a well-established method because it is not
differentiable at the surface of a nucleus. Traditionally, the missing of
exchange term is corrected for by simply excluding the last-proton contribution
to the direct term. %% We also investigate this approach and find that its
effect is simply an introduction of the factor $(Z-1)/Z$ into the Coulomb
direct term. From medium to heavy nuclei (typically beyond the $sd$ shell) the
resulting proton levels are 300-800~keV higher than those obtained with the
exact Fock term. The result for lighter nuclei tends to be opposite because the
factor $(Z-1)/Z$ decreases rapidly towards the limit of $Z\to 1$. Therefore,
this traditional approach should be avoided for a precision nuclear structure

feels a force normal to the surface of the plate, which tends to pull the

has long been theoretically proposed and experimentally observed. In this
paper, we explore the transverse frictional force on an atom moving uniformly
parallel to a perfectly conducting plate. Although many theoretical predictions
can be found for the quantum friction on a particle moving above an imperfect
surface, the extreme situation with a perfectly conducting plate seems to have
been largely ignored by the theoretical community. We investigate this ideal
case as a natural extension of our previous works on quantum vacuum friction
(blackbody friction), and conclude that there does exist a quantum frictional
force on an atom moving above a perfectly conducting plate. Very interestingly,
the distance dependence, the temperature dependence and even the sign of the
frictional force can depend on the polarization state of the atom. For an
isotropic atom with a static polarizability, the resultant frictional force is
found to be negative definite and therefore remains a true drag. Just above the
surface of the plate, the magnitude of the frictional force is twice that of
the quantum vacuum friction in the absence of the plate.

resources in noisy settings often encountered in quantum communication and
computation. Conventionally, distillation requires using some restricted 'free'

approximation of the measurement statistics of a target pure state, which
allows for additional classical postprocessing of the measurement outcomes. We
show that this extended scenario, which we call virtual resource distillation,
provides considerable advantages over standard notions of distillation,
allowing for the purification of noisy states from which no resources can be
distilled conventionally. We show that general states can be virtually
distilled with a cost (measurement overhead) that is inversely proportional to
the amount of existing resource, and we develop methods to efficiently estimate
such cost via convex and semidefinite programming, giving several computable
bounds. We consider applications to coherence, entanglement, and magic
distillation, and an explicit example in quantum teleportation (distributed
quantum computing). This work opens a new avenue for investigating generalized

We find the parameterization, without modification or special treatment, to be

effect can be visualized by a 1/2 scaling of Dicke transition critical pumping
strength against particle number Nat for fermions in a trap. However, the Fermi
surface nesting effect, which manifests the enhancement of superradiance by
Fermi statistics is still very hard to be identified. Here we studied the
influence of localized fermions on the trap edge when both pumping optical
lattice and the trap are presented. We find due to localization, the
statistical effect in superradiant transition is enhanced. Two new scalings of
critical pumping strength are observed as 4/3, and 2/3 for mediate particle
number, and the Pauli blocking scaling 1/3 (2d case) in large particle number
limit is unaffected. Further, we find the 4/3 scaling is subject to a power law
increasing with rising ratio between recoil energy and trap frequency in
pumping laser direction. The divergence of this scaling of critical pumping
strength against $N_{\rm at}$ in $E_R/\omega_x\rightarrow+\infty$ limit can be
identified as the Fermi surface nesting effect. Thus we find a practical
experimental scheme for visualizing the long-desired Fermi surface nesting
effect with the help of trap induced localization in a two-dimensional Fermi

become a critical need in practice. Previous methods achieved promising results
empirically by filter-level pruning. In this paper, we both study this problem
theoretically and propose an effective algorithm aligning well with our
theoretical results. First, we propose the finetune convexity hypothesis to
explain why recent few-shot compression algorithms do not suffer from
overfitting problems. Based on it, a theory is further established to explain
these methods for the first time. Compared to naively finetuning a pruned
network, feature mimicking is proved to achieve a lower variance of parameters
and hence enjoys easier optimization. With our theoretical conclusions, we
claim dropping blocks is a fundamentally superior few-shot compression scheme

which blocks to drop, we propose a new metric, recoverability, to effectively
measure the difficulty of recovering the compressed network. Finally, we
propose an algorithm named PRACTISE to accelerate networks using only tiny

the amount of carbon they store requires knowledge of the seagrass species
present. Using underwater and surface vehicles equipped with machine learning
algorithms can help to accurately estimate the composition and extent of
seagrass meadows at scale. However, previous approaches for seagrass detection
and classification have required full supervision from patch-level labels. In
this paper, we reframe seagrass classification as a weakly supervised coarse
segmentation problem where image-level labels are used during training (25
times fewer labels compared to patch-level labeling) and patch-level outputs
are obtained at inference time. To this end, we introduce SeaFeats, an
architecture that uses unsupervised contrastive pretraining and feature
similarity to separate background and seagrass patches, and SeaCLIP, a model
that showcases the effectiveness of large language models as a supervisory
signal in domain-specific applications. We demonstrate that an ensemble of
SeaFeats and SeaCLIP leads to highly robust performance, with SeaCLIP
conservatively predicting the background class to avoid false seagrass
misclassifications in blurry or dark patches. Our method outperforms previous
approaches that require patch-level labels on the multi-species 'DeepSeagrass'
dataset by 6.8% (absolute) for the class-weighted F1 score, and by 12.1%
(absolute) F1 score for seagrass presence/absence on the 'Global Wetlands'

detection on the Global Wetlands dataset, and application of our method on
imagery collected by FloatyBoat, an autonomous surface vehicle.

mechanisms of macroion release from electrosprayed droplets. However, atomistic
modeling is currently feasible for only the smallest window of droplet sizes
appearing at the end of a disintegrating droplet's lifetime. The relevance of
the observations made to the actual droplet evolution, which is much longer
that the simulated sizes, has not been addressed. Here, we perform a systematic
study of desolvation mechanisms of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), protonated
peptides of different compositions and proteins in order to (a) examine whether
atomistic modeling can establish the extrusion mechanism of proteins from
droplets and (b) obtain insight for the charging mechanism in larger droplets
than those simulated. Atomistic modeling of PEG charging shows that above a
critical droplet size charging occurs transiently by transfer of ions from the
solvent to the macroion, while below the critical size, the capture of the ion
from PEG has a lifetime sufficiently long for extrusion of the charged PEG from
an aqueous droplet. This is the first report of the role of droplet curvature
in the conformations and charging of macroions. Simulations with highly
hydrophobic peptides show that partial extrusion of a peptide from the droplet
surface is rare relative to desolvation by drying-out. Differently from what
has been presented in the literature we argue that atomistic simulations have
not sufficiently established extrusion mechanism of proteins from droplets and
their charging mechanism. Moreover, we argue that release of highly charged
proteins can occur at an earlier stage of a droplet's lifetime than predicted
by atomistic modeling. In this earlier stage, we emphasize the key role of jets
emanating from a droplet at the point of charge-induced instability in the
release of proteins.

since collecting a large amount of paired data (i.e., speech and summary) is

technique is to utilize a text-to-speech (TTS) system to generate synthesized

synthesized speech to the E2E SSum model. Experiments show that our proposed

attributed to ferroic distortion. Surprisingly, the magnitude of the ferroic
BCD is several orders of magnitude greater than that of the non-ferroic BCDs

For such large data sizes, the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional

suggested to be a key component in recently discovered two-dimensional
amorphous materials. While increasing the degree of both disorders could induce
localization of wavefunction in real space, we find that a small degree of

degree of structural defect disorder increases, localized states quickly appear
within the extended phase to enter a broad crossover region with mixed phases.
Full localization occurs when structural defect disorder reaches about 10

We investigate quantum bosonic Maxwell's demon coupled to a two-level system to

leads to an out-of-equilibrium state. Although still super-Poissonian, it can
resonantly excite another two-level system better than any thermal state. To
further reduce the super-Poissonian statistics close to a Poissonian by a

subsequent use of still energetically conservative multiphonon subtractions
performed by an available nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings interaction. The optimal

with data-driven source extensions, such that the simulated data in inaccurate
velocity models match the observed counterpart well enough to prevent cycle
skipping. Then, the source extensions are minimized to update the model
parameters. This two-step workflow is iterated until both data and sources are
matched. It was recently shown that the source extensions are the least-squares
solutions of the recorded scattered data fitting problem. As a result, they are
computed by propagating backward in time the deblurred FWI data residuals,
where the deblurring operator is the inverse of the damped data-domain Hessian
of the scattering-source estimation problem. Estimating the deblurred data
residuals is the main computational bottleneck of time-domain extended-source
FWI (ES-FWI). To mitigate this issue, we first estimate them when the inverse
of the data-domain Hessians is approximated by matching filters in Fourier and
short-time Fourier domains. Second, we refine them with conjugate-gradient
iterations when necessary. Computing the matching filters and performing one
conjugate-gradient iteration each require two simulations per source.
Therefore, it is critical to design some workflows that minimize this
computational burden. We implement time-domain ES-FWI with the augmented
Lagrangian method. Moreover, we further extend its linear regime with a
multiscale frequency continuation approach, which is combined with grid
coarsening to mitigate the computational burden and regularize the inversion.
Finally, we use total-variation regularization to deal with large-contrast
reconstruction. We present synthetic cases where different inversion workflows
carried out with data-domain Hessians of variable accuracy were assessed with
the aim at converging toward accurate solutions while minimizing computational

transactions in the mempool have yet to be utilized to improve the performance
of the clustering heuristics.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap by combining unconfirmed and confirmed
transactions for clustering Bitcoin addresses effectively. First, we present a
data collection system for capturing unconfirmed transactions. Two case studies
are performed to show the presence of user behaviors in unconfirmed
transactions not present in confirmed transactions. Next, we apply the
state-of-the-art clustering heuristics to unconfirmed transactions, and the
clustering results can reduce the number of entities after applying, for
example, the co-spend heuristics in confirmed transactions by 2.3%. Finally, we
propose three novel clustering heuristics to capture specific behavior patterns
in unconfirmed transactions, which further reduce the number of entities after
the application of the co-spend heuristics by 9.8%. Our results demonstrate the
utility of unconfirmed transactions in address clustering and further shed
light on the limitations of anonymity in cryptocurrencies. To the best of our
knowledge, this paper is the first to apply the unconfirmed transactions in
Bitcoin to cluster addresses.

networks has motivated the telecom industry to consider intelligent
self-adapting Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for controlling the growing
portfolio of network services. Infusion of many new types of services is
anticipated with future adoption of 6G networks, and sometimes these services
will be defined by applications that are external to the network. An RL agent
trained for managing the needs of a specific service type may not be ideal for
managing a different service type without domain adaptation. We provide a
simple heuristic for evaluating a measure of proximity between a new service
and existing services, and show that the RL agent of the most proximal service
rapidly adapts to the new service type through a well defined process of domain
adaptation. Our approach enables a trained source policy to adapt to new
situations with changed dynamics without retraining a new policy, thereby
achieving significant computing and cost-effectiveness. Such domain adaptation
techniques may soon provide a foundation for more generalized RL-based service
management under the face of rapidly evolving service types.

the best targets for studying the launching mechanism of active galactic
nucleus jets. Currently, magnetic fields are considered to be an essential
factor in the launching and accelerating of the jet. However, current
observational estimates of the magnetic field strength of the M87 jet are
limited to the innermost part of the jet or to HST-1. No attempt has yet been
made to measure the magnetic field strength in between. We aim to infer the
magnetic field strength of the M87 jet out to a distance of several thousand
$r_s$ by tracking the distance-dependent changes in the synchrotron spectrum of
the jet from high-resolution very long baseline interferometry observations. In
order to obtain high-quality spectral index maps, quasi-simultaneous
observations at 22 and 43 GHz were conducted using the KVN and VERA Array
(KaVA) and the VLBA. We compared the spectral index distributions obtained from
the observations with a model and placed limits on the magnetic field strengths
as a function of distance. The overall spectral morphology is broadly
consistent over the course of these observations. The observed synchrotron
spectrum rapidly steepens from $\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -0.7 at ~ 2 mas to
$\alpha_{22-43 GHz}$ ~ -2.5 at ~ 6 mas. A spectral index model in which
nonthermal electron injections inside the jet decrease with distance can
adequately reproduce the observed trend. This suggests the magnetic field
strength of the jet at a distance of 2 - 10 mas (~ 900 $r_s$ - ~ 4500 $r_s$ in
the deprojected distance) has a range of $B=(0.3 - 1.0 G)(z/2 mas)^{-0.73}$.
Extrapolating to the EHT scale yields consistent results, suggesting that the
majority of the magnetic flux of the jet near the black hole is preserved out
to ~ 4500 $r_s$ without significant dissipation.

reveal that they can only restrict max-lift, resulting in significant min-lift

classify them as either known ('rare yet benign') or unknown (`malicious'). Our
method is collaborative, in that (1) normal behaviors are characterized more

conversion gain and energy resolutions of the individual pixels in these areas
are measured from a large number (more than 25,000) of X-ray events accumulated
for each of the pixels through long time exposures. The energy resolution of
these pixels can reach 140 eV at 6.4 keV at room temperature and shows a
significant positive correlation with the readout noise. The accurate gain can
also be derived individually for each of the pixels from its X-ray spectrum
obtained. Variations of the gain values are found at a level of 0.56%
statistically among the 30 thousand pixels in the areas studied. With the gain
of each pixel determined accurately, a precise gain correction is performed
pixel by pixel in these areas, in contrast to the standardized ensemble gain
used in the conventional method. In this way, we could almost completely
eliminate the degradation of energy resolutions caused by gain variations among
pixels. As a result, the energy resolution at room temperature can be

natural-language navigation instructions in real-world scenes. Existing
approaches have made enormous progress in navigation in new environments, such
as beam search, pre-exploration, and dynamic or hierarchical history encoding.
To balance generalization and efficiency, we resort to memorizing visited
scenarios apart from the ongoing route while navigating. In this work, we
introduce a mechanism of Episodic Scene memory (ESceme) for VLN that wakes an
agent's memories of past visits when it enters the current scene. The episodic
scene memory allows the agent to envision a bigger picture of the next
prediction. This way, the agent learns to utilize dynamically updated
information instead of merely adapting to static observations. We provide a
simple yet effective implementation of ESceme by enhancing the accessible views
at each location and progressively completing the memory while navigating. We
verify the superiority of ESceme on short-horizon (R2R), long-horizon (R4R),
and vision-and-dialog (CVDN) VLN tasks. Our ESceme also wins first place on the
CVDN leaderboard. Code is available: \url{https://github.com/qizhust/esceme}.}

Optical emission lines have now recovered from their minimum emission state
reached in 2007 - 2008. The variations of the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$
emission provide constraints on the inclination of the rotation axis ($i$) and
the obliquity of the magnetic axis ($\beta$). The best agreement between model
and observations is found for ($i$, $\beta$) pairs with $i + \beta \simeq
85^{\circ}$ and $i \in [30^{\circ},55^{\circ}]$. The Balmer emission lines
display stochastic variability at the $\sim 5$ % level on timescales of a few
days. TESS photometry unveils transient modulations on similar timescales in
addition to prominent red noise variations. A Chandra X-ray observation of
December 2021, when the star was at a higher emission level, indicates a slight
increase of the flux and a spectral hardening compared to the August 2002
XMM-Newton observation, taken near minimum emission state. Magnetohydrodynamic
simulations are used to compute synthetic X-ray spectra. With our current best
estimate of the $\dot{M}_{B=0}$ mass-loss rate, the simulated X-ray luminosity
and spectral energy distribution agree very well with the observations.
Finally, the radial velocities vary on a period of 8.5 years with a
peak-to-peak amplitude of 10 - 11 km s$^{-1}$, suggesting orbital motion with
an unseen companion of at least 4 M$_{\odot}$.

cloud map remains a fairly unexplored problem. This cross-modal matching task
is challenging due to the difficulty in extracting consistent descriptors from
images and point clouds. In this paper, we propose the I2P-Rec method to solve
the problem by transforming the cross-modal data into the same modality.
Specifically, we leverage on the recent success of depth estimation networks to
recover point clouds from images. We then project the point clouds into Bird's
Eye View (BEV) images. Using the BEV image as an intermediate representation,
we extract global features with a Convolutional Neural Network followed by a
NetVLAD layer to perform matching. We evaluate our method on the KITTI dataset.
The experimental results show that, with only a small set of training data,
I2P-Rec can achieve a recall rate at Top-1 over 90\%. Also, it can generalize
well to unknown environments, achieving recall rates at Top-1\% over 80\% and

to acquire customers, increase loyalty and boost sales. How to effectively
allocate the incentives so as to maximize the return (e.g., business

literature. This problem is technically challenging due to the facts that 1)
the allocation strategy has to be learned using historically logged data, which
is counterfactual in nature, and 2) both the optimality and feasibility (i.e.,
that cost cannot exceed budget) needs to be assessed before being deployed to
online systems. In this paper, we formulate the problem as a constrained Markov
decision process (CMDP). To solve the CMDP problem with logged counterfactual
data, we propose an efficient learning algorithm which combines bisection
search and model-based planning. First, the CMDP is converted into its dual
using Lagrangian relaxation, which is proved to be monotonic with respect to
the dual variable. Furthermore, we show that the dual problem can be solved by
policy learning, with the optimal dual variable being found efficiently via
bisection search (i.e., by taking advantage of the monotonicity). Lastly, we
show that model-based planing can be used to effectively accelerate the joint
optimization process without retraining the policy for every dual variable.
Empirical results on synthetic and real marketing datasets confirm the

  The main application of our theorem is in the context of acylindrical

developable, acylindrical complexes of hyperbolic groups. Suppose $(\mathcal G,

inclusion $\pi_1(\mathcal G, Y_1)\rightarrow \pi_1(\mathcal G, Y)$ admits the
CT map if the inclusion $B_1\rightarrow B$ satisfies Mitra's criterion. Also

causal features. Through extensive analyses, we demonstrate that the estimated
causal features are highly related to the correct prediction for adversarial

order-chaos-order behavior with increasing energy $E$ along with a seemingly
globally chaotic phase for $5.33g \lesssim E \lesssim 5.6g$. It admits pendulum
and breather families of periodic orbits at all energies. Here, we study
families of periodic orbits that are born at stability transitions of pendula
and breathers. The breather family displays one reverse fork-like
period-doubling bifurcation in its rotational regime. Remarkably, pendula
display geometric cascades of isochronous and period-doubling bifurcations that
accumulate from both the librational and rotational phases at the common energy
$E = 4g$. The new family of periodic orbits born at each of these forward
fork-like bifurcations is found using a novel search algorithm starting from a
perturbation to the pendulum orbit along a transverse eigenvector of its
monodromy matrix. The graphs of stability indices of various classes of newly
born orbits meet at $E = 4g$ forming 'fans'. The transitions in the librational
and rotational phases are related by an asymptotic duality between bifurcation
energies and shapes of newly born periodic orbits, which are captured by
solutions to a Lam\'e equation. We also find analogs of Feigenbaum constants
for self-similarity in (a) stability indices of librational and rotational
pendula and (b) shapes of the newly born librational orbits as $E \to 4g$.
Finally, we argue that none of the infinitely many families of periodic orbits
we have found is stable for $5.33g \lesssim E \lesssim 5.6g$, providing
evidence for global chaos in this energy band.

codes, and have implications for the formation of double NS systems and their
subsequent merger rates. However, many of the standard observational kick
distributions that are used are obtained from samples created only from
isolated NSs. Kick distributions derived in this way overestimate the intrinsic
NS kick distribution. For NSs in binaries, we can only directly estimate the
effect of the natal kick on the binary system, instead of the natal kick
received by the NS itself. Here, for the first time, we present a binary kick
distribution for NSs with low-mass companions. We compile a catalogue of 145
NSs in low-mass binaries with the best available constraints on proper motion,
distance, and systemic radial velocity. For each binary, we use a
three-dimensional approach to estimate its binary kick. We discuss the
implications of these kicks on system formation, and provide a parametric model
for the overall binary kick distribution, for use in future theoretical
modelling work. We compare our results with other work on isolated NSs and NSs
in binaries, finding that the NS kick distributions fit using only isolated
pulsars underestimate the fraction of NSs that receive low kicks. We discuss
the implications of our results on modelling double NS systems, and provide

elucidates the reason why it is so hard to simplify the original model: the
adiabatic elimination of the polarization must be accurate enough to describe
the dynamics correctly over unexpectedly long time scales. Finally, since the
nonlinear wave equation with Toda potential can be simulated on much longer

breaking into 30 K range, which is comparable to Tc values of the classic

shows no sign of saturation up to the maximum pressure of 283 GPa achieved in
our experiments, indicating that Tc may go higher at further rising pressures.
The lift of the 3d orbitals by pressure close to the Fermi energy contributes
to enhanced electron-phonon coupling, leading to dramatic rise of Tc. This work
demonstrates an effective strategy to produce high-Tc superconductivity via
rational pressure induced electronic orbital engineering that may work in

equilibria in imperfect-information games. To scale to games that cannot fit in

minimize regret in the search tree as fast as possible. We propose to
accelerate the regret minimization by introducing a general ``learning not to

starting at multicore processors in desktop computers up to massively parallel
clusters. While domain decomposition methods have a long tradition in
computational mechanics to decompose spatial problems into multiple subproblems
that can be solved in parallel, advancing solution schemes for dynamics or
quasi-statics are inherently serial processes. For quasi-static simulations,
however, there is no accumulating 'time' discretization error, hence an
alternative approach is required. In this paper, we present an Adaptive
Parallel Arc-Length Method (APALM). By using a domain parametrization of the
arc-length instead of time, the multi-level error for the arc-length
parametrization is formed by the load parameter and the solution norm. By
applying local refinements in the arc-length parameter, the APALM refines
solutions where the non-linearity in the load-response space is maximal. The
concept is easily extended for bifurcation problems. The performance of the
method is demonstrated using isogeometric Kirchhoff-Love shells on problems
with snap-through and pitch-fork instabilities. It can be concluded that the
adaptivity of the method works as expected and that a relatively coarse
approximation of the serial initialization can already be used to produce a
good approximation in parallel.

emphasize language priors in feature refinement perspective. Inspired by the
fact that predicates are highly correlated with semantics hidden in
subject-object pair and global context, we propose LANDMARK (LANguage-guiDed

representations from language-vision interactive patterns, global language
context and pair-predicate correlation. Specifically, we first project object
labels to three distinctive semantic embeddings for different representation
learning. Then, Language Attention Module (LAM) and Experience Estimation
Module (EEM) process subject-object word embeddings to attention vector and
predicate distribution, respectively. Language Context Module (LCM) encodes
global context from each word embed-ding, which avoids isolated learning from
local information. Finally, modules outputs are used to update visual
representations and SGG model's prediction. All language representations are
purely generated from object categories so that no extra knowledge is needed.
This framework is model-agnostic and consistently improves performance on
existing SGG models. Besides, representation-level unbiased strategies endow
LANDMARK the advantage of compatibility with other methods. Code is available

investigate the models on two types of NLP tasks, text classification and

generate high quality representations for previously learned tasks in a long

rehearsal plays a significant role in task incremental learning, which bridges

sum of distances between all pairs of nodes in the network. This index,
originally used in chemical graph representations of the non-hydrogen atoms of
a molecule, is considered to be a fundamental and useful network descriptor. We
study the problem of constructing geometric networks on point sets in Euclidean
space that minimize the Wiener index: given a set $P$ of $n$ points in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to construct a network, spanning $P$ and satisfying
certain constraints, that minimizes the Wiener index among the allowable class
of spanning networks.
  In this work, we focus mainly on spanning networks that are trees and we
focus on problems in the plane ($d=2$). We show that any spanning tree that
minimizes the Wiener index has non-crossing edges in the plane. Then, we use
this fact to devise an $O(n^4)$-time algorithm that constructs a spanning tree
of minimum Wiener index for points in convex position. We also prove that the
problem of computing a spanning tree on $P$ whose Wiener index is at most $W$,
while having total (Euclidean) weight at most $B$, is NP-hard.
  Computing a tree that minimizes the Wiener index has been studied in the area
of communication networks, where it is known as the optimum communication
spanning tree problem.

the prime candidates for amplifying and maintaining cosmic magnetic fields. A
few analytical models exist to describe their behaviour but they are based on
simplifying assumptions. For instance the well-known Kazantsev model assumes an
incompressible flow that is delta-correlated in time. However, these
assumptions can break down in the interstellar medium as it is highly
compressible and the velocity field has a finite correlation time. Using the
renewing flow method developed by Bhat and Subramanian (2014), we aim to extend
Kazantsev's results to a more general class of turbulent flows. The cumulative
effect of both compressibility and finite correlation time over the Kazantsev
spectrum is studied analytically. We derive an equation for the longitudinal
two-point magnetic correlation function in real space to first order in the
correlation time $\tau$ and for an arbitrary degree of compressibility (DOC).
This generalised Kazantsev equation encapsulates the original Kazantsev
equation. In the limit of small Strouhal numbers $St \propto \tau$ we use the
WKB approximation to derive the growth rate and scaling of the magnetic power
spectrum. We find the result that the Kazantsev spectrum is preserved, i.e.
$M_k(k)\sim k^{3/2}$. The growth rate is also negligibly affected by the finite
correlation time; however, it is reduced by the finite magnetic diffusivity,
and the DOC together.

correspondingly simulated using the 3-qubit circuit with hardware-efficient

4-qubit circuit with UCC ansatz at the equilibrium point. All the experimental

deployment of machine learning models in the clinical practice. A central
aspect of uncertainty quantification is the ability of a model to return
predictions that are well-aligned with the actual probability of the model
being correct, also known as model calibration. Although many methods have been
proposed to improve calibration, no technique can match the simple, but
expensive approach of training an ensemble of deep neural networks. In this
paper we introduce a form of simplified ensembling that bypasses the costly
training and inference of deep ensembles, yet it keeps its calibration
capabilities. The idea is to replace the common linear classifier at the end of
a network by a set of heads that are supervised with different loss functions
to enforce diversity on their predictions. Specifically, each head is trained
to minimize a weighted Cross-Entropy loss, but the weights are different among
the different branches. We show that the resulting averaged predictions can
achieve excellent calibration without sacrificing accuracy in two challenging
datasets for histopathological and endoscopic image classification. Our
experiments indicate that Multi-Head Multi-Loss classifiers are inherently
well-calibrated, outperforming other recent calibration techniques and even
challenging Deep Ensembles' performance. Code to reproduce our experiments can

interpretation of such anomalies provides evidence for the environment of the
birth of the Sun, its accretion process, the evolution of the solar
proto-planetary disk, and the formation of the planets. A crucial element of
such interpretation is the comparison of the observed anomalies to predictions
from models of stellar nucleosynthesis. To date, however, this comparison has
been limited to a handful of model predictions. This is mostly because the
calculated stellar abundances need to be transformed into a specific
representation, which nuclear astrophysicists and stellar nucleosynthesis
researchers are not familiar with. Here, we show in detail that this
representation is needed to account for mass fractionation effects in meteorite
data that can be generated both in nature and during instrumental analysis. We
explain the required internal normalisation to a selected isotopic ratio,
describe the motivations behind such representation more widely, and provide
the tools to perform the calculations. Then, we present some examples
considering two elements produced by the $slow$ neutron-capture ($s$) process:
Sr and Mo. We show which specific representations for the Sr isotopic

nucleosynthetic signatures from stars of different metallicity. For Mo, the
comparison between data and models is improved due to a recent re-analysis of

different parameterizations of environment. Our most striking result is the
discovery of a ``red-excess'' population in F200W$-$F444W colors both in the
cluster regions and the field. These galaxies have normal F115W$-$F150W colors,
but are up to 0.8 mag redder than red sequence galaxies in F200W$-$F444W. They
also have rather blue rest frame B$-$V colors. {Galaxies in the field and at
the cluster virial radius are overall characterized by redder colors, but
galaxies with the largest color deviations are found in the field and in the
cluster core. Several results} suggest that mechanisms taking place in these
regions might be more effective in producing these colors. Looking at their
morphology, many cluster galaxies show signatures consistent with ram pressure
stripping, while field galaxies have features resembling interactions and
mergers. Our hypothesis is that these galaxies are characterized by dust
enshrouded star formation: a JWST/NIRSpec spectrum for one of the galaxies is
dominated by a strong PAH at 3.3$\mu m$, suggestive of dust obscured star
formation. Larger spectroscopic samples are needed to understand if the color

context of 3D mapping and various robotics applications. However, point cloud
maps acquired using consumer-level light detection and ranging sensors (lidars)
still suffer from bias related to local surface properties such as measuring
beam-to-surface incidence angle, distance, texture, reflectance, or
illumination conditions. This fact has recently motivated researchers to
exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to
suppress the aforementioned depth sensors error while preserving geometric and
map consistency details. Despite the effort, depth correction of lidar
measurements is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean 3D data
that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we introduce two novel point
cloud map consistency losses, which facilitate self-supervised learning on real
data of lidar depth correction models. Specifically, the models exploit
multiple point cloud measurements of the same scene from different view-points
in order to learn to reduce the bias based on the constructed map consistency
signal. Complementary to the removal of the bias from the measurements, we
demonstrate that the depth correction models help to reduce localization drift.
Additionally, we release a data set that contains point cloud data captured in
an indoor corridor environment with precise localization and ground truth
mapping information.

easy-to-hard sequences of knowledge generated from the teachers' trajectories.
To provide guidance according to the student's learning state, HetComp uses
dynamic knowledge construction to provide progressively difficult ranking

size of the training set, $\gamma$ is the data margin, and $r_{\ell,T}$ is a
complexity term that depends on the (tail decay rate) of the loss function (and
on $T$). Our upper bound matches the best known upper bounds due to Shamir

virtually any smooth loss function and relaxing technical assumptions they

magnetopause boundary layer, not the open-closed boundary as previously
thought. They also exhibit slow poleward phase motion rather than being purely
evanescent. We suggest the upward field-aligned current perturbations may
result in periodic auroral brightenings. In the ionosphere, convection vortices
circulate the poleward moving field-aligned current structures. Finally,
surface mode signals are predicted in the ground magnetic field, with
ionospheric Hall currents rotating perturbations by approximately (but not
exactly) 90{\deg} compared to the magnetosphere. Thus typical dayside
magnetopause surface modes should be strongest in the East-West ground magnetic
field component. Overall, all ground-based signatures of the magnetopause
surface mode are predicted to have the same frequency across L-shells,
amplitudes that maximise near the magnetopause's equatorward edge, and larger
latitudinal scales than for field line resonance. Implications in terms of
ionospheric Joule heating and geomagnetically induced currents are discussed.

so, we re-phrase database indexing as a raytracing problem, where we express
the dataset to be indexed as primitives in a scene, and queries as rays. In
this combination, coined RX in the following, lookups are performed as

disruptions could result in severe damage to future high performance devices.
To control and mitigate such runaway electron current, it is important to
accurately describe the runaway electron current dominated equilibrium, based
on which further stability analysis could be carried out. In this paper, we
derive a Grad-Shafranov-like equation solving for the axisymmetric drift
surfaces of the runaway electrons for the simple case that all runaway electron
share the same parallel momentum. This new equilibrium equation is then
numerically solved with simple rectangular wall with ITER-like and MAST-like
geometry parameters. The deviation between the drift surfaces and the flux
surfaces is readily obtained, and runaway electrons is found to be well
confined even in regions with open field lines. The change of the runaway
electron parallel momentum is found to result in a horizontal current center
displacement without any changes in the total current or the external field.
The runaway current density profile is found to affect the susceptibility of
such displacement, with flatter profiles result in more displacement by the
same momentum change. With up-down asymmetry in the external poloidal field,
such displacement is accompanied by a vertical displacement of runaway electron
current. It is found that this effect is more pronounced in smaller, compact
device and weaker poloidal field cases. The above results demonstrate the
dynamics of current center displacement caused by the momentum space change in
the runaway electrons, and pave way for future, more sophisticated runaway
current equilibrium theory with more realistic consideration on the runaway
electron momentum distribution. This new equilibrium theory also provides
foundation for future stability analysis of the runaway electron current.

aid Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approaches in reconstructing maps with practical
semantic information. Current marker-based VSLAM approaches mainly utilize
markers for improving feature detections in low-feature environments and/or for
incorporating loop closure constraints, generating only low-level geometric
maps of the environment prone to inaccuracies in complex environments. To
bridge this gap, this paper presents a VSLAM approach utilizing a monocular
camera along with fiducial markers to generate hierarchical representations of
the environment while improving the camera pose estimate. The proposed approach
detects semantic entities from the surroundings, including walls, corridors,
and rooms encoded within markers, and appropriately adds topological
constraints among them. Experimental results on a real-world dataset collected
with a robot demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a traditional
marker-based VSLAM baseline in terms of accuracy, given the addition of new
constraints while creating enhanced map representations. Furthermore, it shows
satisfactory results when comparing the reconstructed map quality to the one
reconstructed using a LiDAR SLAM approach.

dependent variable. More specifically, we are interested in the strength of the
influence -- i.e., is the feature relevant? -- and, if so, how the feature
influences the dependent variable. Recently, data-driven approaches such as
\emph{random forest regression} have found their way into applications
(Boulesteix et al., 2012). These models allow to directly derive measures of
feature importance, which are a natural indicator of the strength of the
influence. For the relevant features, the correlation or rank correlation
between the feature and the dependent variable has typically been used to
determine the nature of the influence. More recent methods, some of which can
also measure interactions between features, are based on a modeling approach.
In particular, when machine learning models are used, SHAP scores are a recent
and prominent method to determine these trends (Lundberg et al., 2017).
  In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of feature importance based on the
well-studied Gram-Schmidt decorrelation method. Furthermore, we propose two
estimators for identifying trends in the data using random forest regression,
the so-called absolute and relative transversal rate. We empirically compare
the properties of our estimators with those of well-established estimators on a
variety of synthetic and real-world datasets.

proposed as a control scheme to maintain the balloon in the region of a fixed

altitudes. Although air-pump based station keeping has been explored, there is
no research on the control problem for venting and ballasting actuated
balloons, which is commonly used as a low-cost alternative. We show how
reinforcement learning can be used for this type of balloon. Specifically, we
use the soft actor-critic algorithm, which on average is able to station-keep
within 50\;km for 25\% of the flight, consistent with state-of-the-art.
Furthermore, we show that the proposed controller effectively minimises the
consumption of resources, thereby supporting long duration flights. We frame
the controller as a continuous control reinforcement learning problem, which
allows for a more diverse range of trajectories, as opposed to current
state-of-the-art work, which uses discrete action spaces. Furthermore, through
continuous control, we can make use of larger ascent rates which are not
possible using air-pumps. The desired ascent-rate is decoupled into desired
altitude and time-factor to provide a more transparent policy, compared to
low-level control commands used in previous works. Finally, by applying the
equations of motion, we establish appropriate thresholds for venting and
ballasting to prevent the agent from exploiting the environment. More
specifically, we ensure actions are physically feasible by enforcing
constraints on venting and ballasting.

compared to the Eddington limit, the border at which the spherical accretion is
inhibited by the radiation pressure of photons it produces. The discovery of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) showed that accretion can proceed even when
the apparent luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit (Kaaret et al. 2017). High
apparent luminosity might be produced by the beaming of the incident radiation
by a thick collimated outflow or by a truly super-Eddington accretion flow.
However, possibilities to study these outflows in detail are limited, as ULXs
are typically found in distant galaxies. Using the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry
Explorer (IXPE, Weisskopf et al. 2022), we made the first measurement of X-ray
polarization in Galactic X-ray binary Cyg X-3. The detection of high,
$\approx$25\%, nearly energy-independent linear polarization, orthogonal to the
direction of the radio ejections, unambiguously indicates the primary source is
obscured and the observer on Earth only sees reflected and scattered light.
Modelling shows there is an optically thick envelope with a narrow funnel
around the primary X-ray source in the system. We derive an upper limit on the
opening angle of the funnel that implies a lower limit on the beamed luminosity
exceeding the Eddington value. We show that Cyg X-3 is viewed as a ULX to an
extragalactic observer located along the axis of the funnel. Our findings
reveal this unique persistent source as an ideal laboratory for the study of
the inner workings of ULX central engines.

strength in nucleon transfer experiments is based on a Hamiltonian with
two-nucleon interactions only. We point out that in reactions with a
loosely-bound projectile, where clustering and breakup effects are important,
an additional three-body force arises due to three-nucleon ($3N$) interaction
between two nucleons belonging to different clusters in the projectile and a
target nucleon. We study the effects of this force on nucleon transfer in
$(d,p)$ and $(d,n)$ reactions on $^{56}$Ni, $^{48}$Ca, $^{26m}$Al and $^{24}$O
targets at deuteron incident energies between 4 and 40 MeV/nucleon. Deuteron
breakup is treated exactly within a continuum discretized coupled-channel
approach. It was found that an additional three-body force can noticeably alter
the angular distributions at forward angles, with consequences for
spectroscopic factors' studies. Additional study of transfer to $2p$ continuum
in the $^{25}$F$(p,2p)^{24}$O reaction, involving the same overlap function as
in the $^{24}$O($d,n)^{25}$F case, revealed that $3N$ force affects the $(d,n)$
and $(p,2p)$ reactions in a similar way, increasing the cross sections and
decreasing spectroscopic factors, although its influence at the main peak of
$(p,2p)$ is weaker. The angle-integrated cross sections are found to be less
sensitive to the 3N force contribution, they increase by less than 20$\%$.
Including 3N interactions in nucleon removal reactions makes an essential step
towards bringing together nuclear structure theory, where 3N force is routinely
used, and nuclear direct reaction theory, based on two-nucleon interactions
only.

concerns associated with medical data. To circumvent these challenges, data
augmentation has emerged as a promising and cost-effective technique for
increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset. In this study, we
provide a comprehensive review of the specific data augmentation techniques
employed in medical imaging and explore their benefits. We conducted an
in-depth study of all data augmentation techniques used in medical imaging,
identifying 11 different purposes and collecting 65 distinct techniques. The
techniques were operationalized into spatial transformation-based, color and
contrast adjustment-based, noise-based, deformation-based, data mixing-based,
filters and mask-based, division-based, multi-scale and multi-view-based, and
meta-learning-based categories. We observed that some techniques require manual
specification of all parameters, while others rely on automation to adjust the
type and magnitude of augmentation based on task requirements. The utilization
of these techniques enables the development of more robust models that can be
applied in domains with limited or challenging data availability. It is
expected that the list of available techniques will expand in the future,

Since 3SAT can be formulated as unstructured search for satisfying variable

high circuit complexity of amplitude amplification hinders its use on near-term
quantum systems. On the other hand, the Quantum Approximate Optimization
Algorithm (QAOA) is a promising candidate for solving 3SAT for Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices in the near future due to its simple quantum

amplitude amplification-inspired variants of QAOA to improve the success

  Here, we focus on optimal incoherent strategies for two relevant extreme

  In this case, we show that testing whether the black box is described by a

study the impact of using a small set of automatically generated examples (in

sequence of future frames from video-input with a novel spatial-temporal
attention (ST) network is proposed. The ST transformer network allows
constraining both temporal consistency across future frames whilst constraining
consistency across spatial objects in the image at different scales. This was
not the case in prior works for depth prediction, which focused on predicting a
single frame as output. The proposed model leverages prior scene knowledge such
as object shape and texture similar to single-image depth inference methods,
whilst also constraining the motion and geometry from a sequence of input
images. Apart from the transformer architecture, one of the main contributions
with respect to prior works lies in the objective function that enforces
spatio-temporal consistency across a sequence of output frames rather than a
single output frame. As will be shown, this results in more accurate and robust
depth sequence forecasting. The model achieves highly accurate depth
forecasting results that outperform existing baselines on the KITTI benchmark.
Extensive ablation studies were performed to assess the effectiveness of the
proposed techniques. One remarkable result of the proposed model is that it is
implicitly capable of forecasting the motion of objects in the scene, rather
than requiring complex models involving multi-object detection, segmentation
and tracking.

challenging task in information retrieval and is commonly known as
Query-by-Document (QBD) retrieval. Specifically designed Transformer models
that can handle long input sequences have not shown high effectiveness in QBD
tasks in previous work. We propose a Re-Ranker based on the novel Proportional
Relevance Score (RPRS) to compute the relevance score between a query and the
top-k candidate documents. Our extensive evaluation shows RPRS obtains
significantly better results than the state-of-the-art models on five different

pre-processed, embedded, and indexed before query time which gives our
re-ranker the advantage of having a complexity of O(N) where N is the total
number of sentences in the query and candidate documents. Furthermore, our
method solves the problem of the low-resource training in QBD retrieval tasks
as it does not need large amounts of training data, and has only three
parameters with a limited range that can be optimized with a grid search even
if a small amount of labeled data is available. Our detailed analysis shows
that RPRS benefits from covering the full length of candidate documents and
queries.

discovery of this kind of energetic explosions. However, an accurate
measurement of the prompt emission properties of this burst is very challenging
due to its exceptional brightness. With joint observations of
\textit{Insight}-HXMT and GECAM-C, we made an unprecedentedly accurate
measurement of the emission during the first $\sim$1800 s of GRB 221009A,
including its precursor, main emission (ME, which dominates the burst in flux),
flaring emission and early afterglow, in the hard X-ray to soft gamma-ray band
from $\sim$ 10 keV to $\sim$ 6 MeV. Based on the GECAM-C unsaturated data of
the ME, we measure a record-breaking isotropic equivalent energy ($E_{\rm
iso}$) of $\bf \sim 1.5 \times 10^{55}$ erg, which is about eight times the
total rest-mass energy of the Sun. The early afterglow data require a
significant jet break between 650 s and 1100 s, most likely at $\sim950$ s from
the afterglow starting time $T_{AG}$, which corresponds to a jet opening angle
of $\sim {0.7^\circ} \ (\eta_\gamma n)^{1/8}$, where $n$ is the ambient medium
density in units of $\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\eta_\gamma$ is the ratio between
$\gamma$-ray energy and afterglow kinetic energy. The beaming-corrected total
$\gamma$-ray energy $E_{\gamma}$ is $\sim 1.15 \times10^{51} \ (\eta_\gamma
n)^{1/4}$ erg, which is typical for long GRBs. These results suggest that this
GRB may have a special central engine, which could launch and collimate a very
narrowly beamed jet with an ordinary energy budget, leading to exceptionally
luminous gamma-ray radiation per unit solid angle. Alternatively, more GRBs
might have such a narrow and bright beam, which are missed by an unfavorable
viewing angle or have been detected without distance measurement.

layer-dependent SCO and insulator-metal transition in vdW magnet,FePS3, under
high pressure using micro-Raman scattering.Experimentally obtained spectra, in
agreement with the computed Raman modes, indicates evidence of IMT of FePS3

(S=0) with a thickness dependent critical pressure (P_c) which reduces to 1.45
GPa in 3-layer flakes compared to 10.8 GPa for the bulk counterpart.
Additionally, a broad Raman mode (P*) emerges between 310 cm^{-1} and 370
cm^{-1} at elevated pressure for three different thicknesses of FePS3 flakes
(3-100 layers), also corroborated with computational results which suggests the
pressure dependent decrease of metal-ligand bond distance(Fe-S) with lowering
of magnetic moment in FePS3. Phenomenologically, our results in few-layer
flakes with strong structural anisotropy which enhances the in-plane strain
with applied pressure can be understood by adopting Hubbard model and
considering the spectral-range (bandwidth W) as a function of layer numbers and
pressure with a power-law scaling. Reduction of the critical pressure for phase
transition in few-layer vdW magnets to 1-2 GPa marks the possibility of using
nano-enclosure fit for use in device electronics where the pressure is induced
due to interfacial adhesion, like in vdW heterostructure or molecules trapped

via robot-to-robot measurements for a multi-robot system. We propose a
distributed consistent CL algorithm. The key idea is to perform the EKF-based
state estimation in a transformed coordinate system. Specifically, a coordinate
transformation is constructed by decomposing the state-propagation Jacobian by
which the correct observability properties are guaranteed. Moreover, the
transformed state-propagation Jacobian becomes an identity matrix which is more
suitable for distribution. In the proposed algorithm, a server-based framework
is adopted to distributely estimate the robot pose in which each robot
propagates its pose estimations and the server maintains the correlations. To
reduce communication costs, only when the multi-robot system takes a
robot-to-robot relative measurement, the robots and the server exchange
information to update the pose estimations and the correlations. In addition,
no assumptions are made about the type of robots or relative measurements. The
proposed algorithm has been validated by experiments and shown to outperform
the state-of-art algorithms in terms of consistency and accuracy.

probabilistic model to describe the dynamics of growth processes with
reinforcement, a generic example being competition of agents in evolving

may exhibit monopoly, where a single agent achieves full market share. Besides
this general result, various further results for particular feedback mechanisms
have been derived from different perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to
provide a comprehensive account of the possible asymptotic behaviour for a
large general class of feedback functions. We distinguish two main types of
feedback, (super-)exponential or sub-exponential, that require separate
approaches to understand the monopoly case. This difference is also
conceptually interesting, and we present a general criterion to predict the (in
general random) monopolist with high probability under generic initial
conditions. In the non-monopoly case, we establish the long-time asymptotics of
market shares, which even holds when there is no stable limit. We also include
a detailed analysis of almost linear feedback functions to characterize the
transition between non-monopoly and monoply. Finally, we derive a scaling limit

increasing the model complexity. For FSD, some fine-grained information is very
important, such as spectrogram defects, mute segments, and so on, which are
often perceived by shallow networks. However, shallow networks have much noise,
which can not capture this very well. To address this problem, we propose using
the deepest network instruct shallow network for enhancing shallow networks.
Specifically, the networks of FSD are divided into several segments, the
deepest network being used as the teacher model, and all shallow networks
become multiple student models by adding classifiers. Meanwhile, the
distillation path between the deepest network feature and shallow network
features is used to reduce the feature difference. A series of experimental
results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA and PA datasets show the effectiveness of the
proposed method, with significant improvements compared to the baseline.

  Comprehensive Review","The first version of the review. Comments are welcomed",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Grid-centric perception is a crucial field for mobile robot perception and
navigation. Nonetheless, grid-centric perception is less prevalent than
object-centric perception for autonomous driving as autonomous vehicles need to
accurately perceive highly dynamic, large-scale outdoor traffic scenarios and
the complexity and computational costs of grid-centric perception are high. The
rapid development of deep learning techniques and hardware gives fresh insights
into the evolution of grid-centric perception and enables the deployment of
many real-time algorithms. Current industrial and academic research
demonstrates the great advantages of grid-centric perception, such as
comprehensive fine-grained environmental representation, greater robustness to
occlusion, more efficient sensor fusion, and safer planning policies. Given the
lack of current surveys for this rapidly expanding field, we present a
hierarchically-structured review of grid-centric perception for autonomous
vehicles. We organize previous and current knowledge of occupancy grid
techniques and provide a systematic in-depth analysis of algorithms in terms of
three aspects: feature representation, data utility, and applications in
autonomous driving systems. Lastly, we present a summary of the current
research trend and provide some probable future outlooks.

training, where multiple GPUs perform SGD independently and average the model
parameters periodically. It has been recently observed that Local SGD can not
only achieve the design goal of reducing the communication overhead but also
lead to higher test accuracy than the corresponding SGD baseline (Lin et al.,
2020b), though the training regimes for this to happen are still in debate
(Ortiz et al., 2021). This paper aims to understand why (and when) Local SGD
generalizes better based on Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)
approximation. The main contributions of this paper include (i) the derivation
of an SDE that captures the long-term behavior of Local SGD in the small
learning rate regime, showing how noise drives the iterate to drift and diffuse
after it has reached close to the manifold of local minima, (ii) a comparison
between the SDEs of Local SGD and SGD, showing that Local SGD induces a
stronger drift term that can result in a stronger effect of regularization,
e.g., a faster reduction of sharpness, and (iii) empirical evidence validating
that having a small learning rate and long enough training time enables the
generalization improvement over SGD but removing either of the two conditions
leads to no improvement.

  Misinformation",,,,,"cs.MM cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  With the expansion of social media and the increasing dissemination of
multimedia content, the spread of misinformation has become a major concern.
This necessitates effective strategies for multimodal misinformation detection
(MMD) that detect whether the combination of an image and its accompanying text
could mislead or misinform. Due to the data-intensive nature of deep neural
networks and the labor-intensive process of manual annotation, researchers have
been exploring various methods for automatically generating synthetic
multimodal misinformation - which we refer to as Synthetic Misinformers - in
order to train MMD models. However, limited evaluation on real-world
misinformation and a lack of comparisons with other Synthetic Misinformers
makes difficult to assess progress in the field. To address this, we perform a
comparative study on existing and new Synthetic Misinformers that involves (1)
out-of-context (OOC) image-caption pairs, (2) cross-modal named entity
inconsistency (NEI) as well as (3) hybrid approaches and we evaluate them
against real-world misinformation; using the COSMOS benchmark. The comparative
study showed that our proposed CLIP-based Named Entity Swapping can lead to MMD
models that surpass other OOC and NEI Misinformers in terms of multimodal
accuracy and that hybrid approaches can lead to even higher detection accuracy.
Nevertheless, after alleviating information leakage from the COSMOS evaluation
protocol, low Sensitivity scores indicate that the task is significantly more
challenging than previous studies suggested. Finally, our findings showed that
NEI-based Synthetic Misinformers tend to suffer from a unimodal bias, where
text-only MMDs can outperform multimodal ones.

locating and classifying objects in image. Although current devices can easily
take very high-resolution images, current approaches of object detection seldom
consider detecting tiny object or the large scale variance problem in high
resolution images. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet efficient approach
that improves accuracy of object detection especially for small objects and
large scale variance scene while reducing the computational cost in high
resolution image. Inspired by observing that overall detection accuracy is
reduced if the image is properly down-sampled but the recall rate is not
significantly reduced. Besides, small objects can be better detected by
inputting high-resolution images even if using lightweight detector. We propose
a cluster-based coarse-to-fine object detection framework to enhance the
performance for detecting small objects while ensure the accuracy of large
objects in high-resolution images. For the first stage, we perform coarse
detection on the down-sampled image and center localization of small objects by
lightweight detector on high-resolution image, and then obtains image chips
based on cluster region generation method by coarse detection and center
localization results, and further sends chips to the second stage detector for
fine detection. Finally, we merge the coarse detection and fine detection
results. Our approach can make good use of the sparsity of the objects and the
information in high-resolution image, thereby making the detection more
efficient. Experiment results show that our proposed approach achieves
promising performance compared with other state-of-the-art detectors.

challenge ever since the launch of the first Defense Meteorological Satellite

the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) in 1997 but until recently the
data were processed pixel-by-pixel or taking a few neighboring pixels into
account. Deep learning has obtained remarkable improvement in the computer
vision field, and offers a whole new way to tackle the rain retrieval problem.
The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core satellite carries similarly to
TRMM, a passive microwave radiometer and a radar that share part of their
swath. The brightness temperatures measured in the 37 and 89 GHz channels are
used like the RGB components of a regular image while rain rate from Dual
Frequency radar provides the surface rain. A U-net is then trained on these
data to develop a retrieval algorithm: Deep-learning RAIN (DRAIN). With only
four brightness temperatures as an input and no other a priori information,
DRAIN is offering similar or slightly better performances than GPROF, the GPM
official algorithm, in most situations. These performances are assumed to be
due to the fact that DRAIN works on an image basis instead of the classical
pixel-by-pixel basis.

and the variational quantum eigensolver. To this end, we consider naive and
physically motivated, classically efficient product ansatz for the parametrized
wavefunction adapting the separable pair ansatz form. We combine it with
post-treatment to account for interactions between subsystems originating from
this ansatz. The classical treatment is given by another quantum circuit that
has support between the enforced subsystems and is folded into the Hamiltonian.
To avoid an exponential increase in the number of Hamiltonian terms, the
entangling operations are constructed from purely Clifford or near-Clifford
circuits. While Clifford circuits can be simulated efficiently classically,
they are not universal. In order to account for missing expressibility,
near-Clifford circuits with only few, selected non-Clifford gates are employed.
The exact circuit structure to achieve this objective is molecule-dependent and
is constructed using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. We demonstrate
our approach on a set of molecules of interest and investigate the extent of
our methodology's reach. Empirical validation of our approach using numerical
simulations shows a reduction of the qubit count of up to a 50\% at a similar

classical goodness-of-fit techniques when faced with large samples. The second

reliable transmission, i.e., error correction towards ML performance. Achieving
near-ML performance is very challenging especially for short block lengths.
Polar codes are a promising candidate and already part of the 5G standard. The
Successive Cancellation List (SCL) decoding algorithm provides very good error
correction performance but at the cost of high computational decoding
complexity resulting in large latency and low area and energy efficiency.
Recently, Automorphism Ensemble Decoding (AED) gained a lot of attention to
improve the error correction capability. In contrast to SCL, AED performs
several low-complexity (e.g., SC) decoding in parallel. However, it is an open
question whether AED can compete with sophisticated SCL decoders, especially
from an implementation perspective in state of the art silicon technologies. In
this paper we present an elaborated AED architecture that uses an advanced path
metric based candidate selection to reduce the implementation complexity and
compare it to state of the art SCL decoders in a 12nm FinFET technology. Our
AED implementation outperform state of the art SCL decoders by up to 4.4x in
latency, 8.9x in area efficiency and 4.6x in energy efficiency, while providing
the same or even better error correction performance.

low-resource VQA. Specifically, MixPHM is a lightweight module implemented by
multiple PHM-experts in a mixture-of-experts manner. To reduce parameter
redundancy, MixPHM reparameterizes expert weights in a low-rank subspace and
shares part of the weights inside and across experts. Moreover, based on a
quantitative redundancy analysis for adapters, we propose Redundancy
Regularization to reduce task-irrelevant redundancy while promoting
task-relevant correlation in MixPHM representations. Experiments conducted on
VQA v2, GQA, and OK-VQA demonstrate that MixPHM outperforms state-of-the-art

the impact of such symmetry-breaking couplings on the magnetic phase diagram

to generate a high-pressure bubble that drives a cylinder to a maximum velocity
of about 25 m/s within 1 ms. A tail bubble forms as the cylinder is ejected
from the launch tube. Moreover, we observe a shoulder cavity around the head of

numerical model reproduces the experimental observations quite well, including
the cylinder motion and the transient evolution of the bubbles. Thereafter, a

typically utilizes Class Activation Map (CAM) to generate the pseudo labels.
Limited by the local structure perception of CNN, CAM usually cannot identify

remedy this flaw, we observe it also brings the over-smoothing issue, \ie, the
final patch tokens incline to be uniform. In this work, we propose Token
Contrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for
WSSS. Firstly, motivated by the observation that intermediate layers in ViT can
still retain semantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast module
(PTC). PTC supervises the final patch tokens with the pseudo token relations
derived from intermediate layers, allowing them to align the semantic regions
and thus yield more accurate CAM. Secondly, to further differentiate the
low-confidence regions in CAM, we devised a Class Token Contrast module (CTC)
inspired by the fact that class tokens in ViT can capture high-level semantics.
CTC facilitates the representation consistency between uncertain local regions
and global objects by contrasting their class tokens. Experiments on the PASCAL

applying two advanced, complex algorithms. While they have already triggered an
intensive R&D, they are still subject to further improvements. Making such

  Segmentation","accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) has recently gained increasing
research interest as it can reduce the requirement for large-scale
fully-annotated training data. The current methods often suffer from the
confirmation bias from the pseudo-labelling process, which can be alleviated by
the co-training framework. The current co-training-based SSS methods rely on
hand-crafted perturbations to prevent the different sub-nets from collapsing
into each other, but these artificial perturbations cannot lead to the optimal
solution. In this work, we propose a new conflict-based cross-view consistency
(CCVC) method based on a two-branch co-training framework which aims at
enforcing the two sub-nets to learn informative features from irrelevant views.
In particular, we first propose a new cross-view consistency (CVC) strategy
that encourages the two sub-nets to learn distinct features from the same input
by introducing a feature discrepancy loss, while these distinct features are
expected to generate consistent prediction scores of the input. The CVC
strategy helps to prevent the two sub-nets from stepping into the collapse. In
addition, we further propose a conflict-based pseudo-labelling (CPL) method to
guarantee the model will learn more useful information from conflicting
predictions, which will lead to a stable training process. We validate our new
CCVC approach on the SSS benchmark datasets where our method achieves new
state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at

the conflict between the high memory demand and limited GPU memory. Recently,
distributed full-graph GNN training has been widely adopted to tackle this
problem. However, the substantial inter-GPU communication overhead can cause
severe throughput degradation. Existing communication compression techniques
mainly focus on traditional DNN training, whose bottleneck lies in
synchronizing gradients and parameters. We find they do not work well in
distributed GNN training as the barrier is the layer-wise communication of
features during the forward pass & feature gradients during the backward pass.
To this end, we propose an efficient distributed GNN training framework Sylvie,
which employs one-bit quantization technique in GNNs and further pipelines the
curtailed communication with computation to enormously shrink the overhead
while maintaining the model quality. In detail, Sylvie provides a lightweight
Low-bit Module to quantize the sent data and dequantize the received data back
to full precision values in each layer. Additionally, we propose a Bounded
Staleness Adaptor to control the introduced staleness to achieve further
performance enhancement. We conduct theoretical convergence analysis and
extensive experiments on various models & datasets to demonstrate Sylvie can
considerably boost the training throughput by up to 28.1x.

Embedded language implementations of session types follow suit. They either

  We present a new language embedded implementation of session types, which is

an embedded implementation of session types which guarantees deadlock freedom

attention is paid to the description of the binding mechanism in terms of
attractive potential wells, induced by the refractive index changes of the
subpulses, exerted on one another through cross-phase modulation. Specifically,
we discuss nonlinear-photonics meta atoms, given by pulse compounds consisting
of a strong trapping pulse and a weak trapped pulse, for which trapped states
of low intensity are determined by a Schr\""odinger-type eigenproblem. We
discuss the rich dynamical behavior of such meta-atoms, demonstrating that an
increase of the group-velocity mismatch of both subpulses leads to an
ionization-like trapping-to-escape transition. We further demonstrate that if
both constituent pulses are of similar amplitude, molecule-like bound-states
are formed. We show that z-periodic amplitude variations permit a coupling of
these pulse compound to dispersive waves, resulting in the resonant emission of
Kushi-comb-like multi-frequency radiation.

to computing can mutually enhance each others' performances thus bringing the

In order to accommodate this new class of codes, a proper environment has to be
created, which enables the interplay between the quantum and classical
hardware.
  For many of these hybrid processes the coherence time of the quantum computer
arises as a natural time constraint, making it crucial to minimize the
classical overhead. For ion-trap quantum computers however, this is a much less
limiting factor than with superconducting technologies, since the relevant
timescale is on the order of seconds instead of microseconds. In fact, this
long coherence time enables us to develop a scheme for real-time control of
quantum computations in an interpreted programming language like Python. In
particular, compilation of all instructions in advance is not necessary, unlike
with superconducting qubits. This keeps the implementation of hybrid algorithms
simple and also lets users benefit from the rich environment of existing Python

analytically in a perturbative and non-perturbative manner. For this purpose,
we investigate the radial Hall conductivity that emerges from an additional
homogeneous electric field perturbation perpendicular to the 2D electron gas,
which solely interacts via spin-orbit coupling. Numerical calculations of the
absorptive spin-orbit spectra show for an ideal InSb electron gas a behaviour
that is dominated by the localized (atomic) part of the distorted Landau
levels. In contrast, however, we also find analytically that a (non-local)
divergent static response emerges for Fermi energies close to the ionization
energy in the thermodynamic limit. The divergent linear response implies that
the external electric field is entirely absorbed outside the 2D electron gas by
induced radial spin-orbit currents, as it would be the case inside a perfect
conductor. This spin-orbit induced polarization mechanism depends on the
effective $g^*$-factor of the material for which it shows a critical behaviour
at $g^*_c=2$, where it abruptly switches direction. The diverging absorption
relies on the presence of degenerate energies with allowed selection rules that
are imposed by the radial symmetry of our inhomogeneous setup. We show
analytically the presence of a discrete Rydberg-like band structure that obeys
these symmetry properties. In a last step, we investigate the robustness of the
spectra by solving analytically the Dirac equation expanded up to order
$1/(mc)^2$. We find that the distorted Landau-levels, and thus the divergent
spin-orbit polarization, remain protected with respect to slow changes of the

protocols can be used for certifying a qubit, a building-block that stands at

  Certifying qubits was previously only known to be possible based on the
hardness of the Learning with Errors problem and the use of adaptive hardcore
(Brakerski et al., 2018). Our framework allows certification of qubits based
only on the existence of post-quantum trapdoor claw-free functions, or on
quantum fully homomorphic encryption. These can be instantiated, for example,
from Ring Learning with Errors.
  On the technical side, we show that the quantum soundness of any such
protocol can be reduced to proving a bound on a simple algorithmic task:
informally, answering ``two challenges simultaneously'' in the protocol. Our
reduction formalizes the intuition that these protocols demonstrate quantumness
by leveraging the impossibility of rewinding a general quantum prover. This
allows us to prove tight bounds on the quantum soundness of (Kahanamoku-Meyer

prover can succeed with probability larger than $\cos^2 \frac{\pi}{8}\approx
0.853$. Previously, only an upper bound on the success probability of classical
provers, and a lower bound on the success probability of quantum provers, were

tasks. However, due to unpredictable/unconsidered operating conditions,
unexpected failures show up on field, making the performance of a DNN in
operation very different from the one estimated prior to release. In the life
cycle of DNN systems, the assessment of accuracy is typically addressed in two
ways: offline, via sampling of operational inputs, or online, via
pseudo-oracles. The former is considered more expensive due to the need for
manual labeling of the sampled inputs. The latter is automatic but less
accurate. We believe that emerging iterative industrial-strength life cycle
models for Machine Learning systems, like MLOps, offer the possibility to
leverage inputs observed in operation not only to provide faithful estimates of
a DNN accuracy, but also to improve it through remodeling/retraining actions.
We propose DAIC (DNN Assessment and Improvement Cycle), an approach which
combines ''low-cost'' online pseudo-oracles and ''high-cost'' offline sampling
techniques to estimate and improve the operational accuracy of a DNN in the
iterations of its life cycle. Preliminary results show the benefits of
combining the two approaches and integrating them in the DNN life cycle.

selecting their preferred number of users, items, samples, and stochastic

model is fed with dense, short, and continuous embedding representations of
items and users, instead of sparse, large, and discrete vectors, to make an
accurate and quick learning, compared to the traditional approach based on
large and sparse input vectors. The proposed architecture includes a DeepMF
model to extract the dense user and item embeddings, as well as a clustering
process to convert from the dense GAN generated samples to the discrete and
sparse ones, necessary to create each required synthetic dataset. The results
of three different source datasets show adequate distributions and expected
quality values and evolutions on the generated datasets compared to the source
ones. Synthetic datasets and source codes are available to researchers.

a failure can lead to something as severe as injury or death. For our topic, we
consider the hybrid human-AI teaming case where a managing agent is tasked with
identifying when to perform a delegation assignment and whether the human or

estimate its best action based on the likelihood of either (human, autonomous)

ability to test for their quality is severely challenged. Many systems are
called to operate in uncertain and highly-changing environment, not rarely
required to make intelligent decisions by themselves. This easily results in an
intractable state space to explore at testing time. The state-of-the-art
techniques try to keep the pace, e.g., by augmenting the tester's intuition
with some form of (explicit or implicit) learning from observations to search
this space efficiently. For instance, they exploit historical data to drive the
search (e.g., ML-driven testing) or the tests execution data itself (e.g.,
adaptive or search-based testing). Despite the indubitable advances, the need
for smartening the search in such a huge space keeps to be pressing.
  We introduce Reasoning-Based Software Testing (RBST), a new way of thinking
at the testing problem as a causal reasoning task. Compared to mere
intuition-based or state-of-the-art learning-based strategies, we claim that
causal reasoning more naturally emulates the process that a human would do to
''smartly"" search the space. RBST aims to mimic and amplify, with the power of
computation, this ability. The conceptual leap can pave the ground to a new
trend of techniques, which can be variously instantiated from the proposed
framework, by exploiting the numerous tools for causal discovery and inference.

for artificial intelligence for a long time. A common strategy to handle the
POIR problem is using the non-occluded features for classification.
Unfortunately, this strategy will lose effectiveness when the image is severely
occluded, since the visible parts can only provide limited information. Several
studies in neuroscience reveal that feature restoration which fills in the
occluded information and is called amodal completion is essential for human
brains to recognize partially occluded images. However, feature restoration is
commonly ignored by CNNs, which may be the reason why CNNs are ineffective for
the POIR problem. Inspired by this, we propose a novel brain-inspired feature
restoration network (BIFRNet) to solve the POIR problem. It mimics a ventral
visual pathway to extract image features and a dorsal visual pathway to
distinguish occluded and visible image regions. In addition, it also uses a
knowledge module to store object prior knowledge and uses a completion module
to restore occluded features based on visible features and prior knowledge.
Thorough experiments on synthetic and real-world occluded image datasets show
that BIFRNet outperforms the existing methods in solving the POIR problem.
Especially for severely occluded images, BIRFRNet surpasses other methods by a
large margin and is close to the human brain performance. Furthermore, the
brain-inspired design makes BIFRNet more interpretable.

previous works address this problem in a goal-conditioned way and adapt the

adapted natural language specification and proposed a language-conditioned
deformable object manipulation policy learning framework. We first design a
unified Transformer-based architecture to understand multi-modal data and
output picking and placing action. Besides, we have introduced the visible
connectivity graph to tackle nonlinear dynamics and complex configuration of
the deformable object in the manipulation process. Both simulated and real
experiments have demonstrated that the proposed method is general and effective
in language-conditioned deformable object manipulation policy learning. Our
method achieves much higher success rates on various language-conditioned
deformable object manipulation tasks (87.3% on average) than the
state-of-the-art method in simulation experiments. Besides, our method is much
lighter and has a 75.6% shorter inference time than state-of-the-art methods.

image-driven, where facial parameters are optimized so that the rendered

novel text-to-parameter translation method (T2P) to achieve zero-shot
text-driven game character auto-creation. With our method, users can create a
vivid in-game character with arbitrary text description without using any
reference photo or editing hundreds of parameters manually. In our method,
taking the power of large-scale pre-trained multi-modal CLIP and neural
rendering, T2P searches both continuous facial parameters and discrete facial

representation, previous methods have difficulty in effectively learning
discrete facial parameters. T2P, to our best knowledge, is the first method
that can handle the optimization of both discrete and continuous parameters.
Experimental results show that T2P can generate high-quality and vivid game
characters with given text prompts. T2P outperforms other SOTA text-to-3D

calculations confirm semi-metallic character. Fermi surface topology shows both
electron and hole sheets. The single crystal elastic constants reveal that
PbTaSe2 is elastically stable. The compound is soft, brittle, and highly
machinable at the same time. It also possesses very high level of dry
lubricity. Various anisotropy indicators suggest that PbTaSe2 is elastically
anisotropic with layered character. The phonon dynamics has been investigated.
Phonon dispersion plot shows that the compound is dynamically stable with a
clear frequency gap between the acoustic and optical branches. The Debye
temperature, phonon thermal conductivity, and melting temperature of PbTaSe2 is
low. The compound has medium Gr\""uneisen parameter. The bonding character is
mainly dominated by ionic bonding with some metallic contribution. The optical
parameters have been studied in detail. The optical spectra reveal metallic
features. The compound reflects visible light very efficiently (reflectance
above 60%). It is also an efficient absorber of the ultraviolet light. The
compound exhibits significant optical anisotropy with respect to the
polarization directions of the incident electric field.

variety of plasma models. However, the effects of the electron inertia on those

three-dimensional (3D) geometry. We investigate this problem by carrying out 3D
hybrid-kinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of decaying turbulence with
our CHIEF code. The main distinguishing feature of this code is an
implementation of the electron inertia without approximations. We find that the
electron inertia plays a critical role in regulating and limiting the largest
values of current density in both real and wavenumber Fourier space, in
particular near and, unexpectedly, even above electron scales. In addition, a
comparison of current sheets formed in 2D vs 3D turbulence reveal that the
latter tend to have smaller values of current density, in particular near
electron scales. The electron inertia is thus of fundamental importance to
accurately describe the nature of plasma turbulence and current-sheet

programs with many moving parts. Efficient inference often requires customising
an algorithm to a particular probabilistic model or problem, sometimes called
inference programming. Most inference frameworks are implemented in languages
that lack a disciplined approach to side effects, which can result in
monolithic implementations where the structure of the algorithms is obscured
and inference programming is hard. Functional programming with typed effects
offers a more structured and modular foundation for programmable inference,
with monad transformers being the primary structuring mechanism explored to
date.
  This paper presents an alternative approach to programmable inference, based
on algebraic effects, building on recent work that used algebraic effects to
represent probabilistic models. Using effect signatures to specify the key
operations of the algorithms, and effect handlers to modularly interpret those
operations for specific variants, we develop three abstract algorithms, or
inference patterns, representing three important classes of inference:
Metropolis-Hastings, particle filtering, and guided optimisation. We show how
our approach reveals the algorithms' high-level structure, and makes it easy to
tailor and recombine their parts into new variants. We implement the three
inference patterns as a Haskell library, and discuss the pros and cons of
algebraic effects vis-a-vis monad transformers as a structuring mechanism for
modular imperative algorithm design. It should be possible to reimplement our
library in any typed functional language able to emulate effects and effect
handlers.

properties including the energy position and spacing of electronic, vibrational
and rotational levels, thus modifying the dynamics associated to their coherent
superposition. In extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy, the photoelectron leaving
the molecule after the absorption of a single photon can trigger an ultrafast
nuclear motion in the cation, which can lead, eventually, to molecular
fragmentation. This dynamics depends on the mass of the constituents of the
cation, thus showing, in general, a significant isotopic dependence. In
time-resolved attosecond photoelectron interferometry, the absorption of the
extreme ultraviolet photon is accompanied by the exchange of an additional
quantum of energy (typically in the infrared spectral range) with the
photoelectron-photoion system, offering the opportunity to investigate in time
the influence of isotopic substitution on the characteristics of the
photoionisation dynamics. Here we show that attosecond photoelectron
interferometry is sensitive to isotopic substitution by investigating the
two-color photoionisation spectra measured in a mixture of methane (CH$_4$) and
deuteromethane (CD$_4$). The isotopic dependence manifests itself in the
modification of the amplitude and contrast of the oscillations of the
photoelectron peaks generated in the two-color field with the two
isotopologues. The observed effects are interpreted considering the differences
in the time evolution of the nuclear autocorrelation functions in the two
molecules.

another implicit function to lazily compute the signed distance to the swept

by exploiting continuity in space-time, and the implicit function guarantees

leverages data from previous tasks to quickly learn a new task, despite limited
data. In particular, model agnostic methods look for initialisation points from
which gradient descent quickly adapts to any new task. Although it has been
empirically suggested that such methods learn a good shared representation
during training, there is no strong theoretical evidence of such behavior. More
importantly, it is unclear whether these methods truly are model agnostic,
i.e., whether they still learn a shared structure despite architecture
misspecifications. To fill this gap, this work shows in the limit of an
infinite number of tasks that first order ANIL with a linear two-layer network
architecture successfully learns a linear shared representation. Moreover, this
result holds despite misspecifications: having a large width with respect to
the hidden dimension of the shared representation does not harm the algorithm
performance. The learnt parameters then allow to get a small test loss after a
single gradient step on any new task. Overall this illustrates how well model
agnostic methods can adapt to any (unknown) model structure.

networks, Appl. Numer. Math., 172, pp. 186-205, 2022], which allows to measure
how sensitive the total communicability of a network is to the addition or
removal of certain edges. One shortcoming of this concept is that sensitivities
are extremely costly to compute when using a straight-forward approach (orders
of magnitude more expensive than the corresponding communicability measures).
In this work, we present computational procedures for estimating network
sensitivity with a cost that is essentially linear in the number of nodes for
many real-world complex networks. Additionally, we extend the sensitivity
concept such that it also covers sensitivity of subgraph centrality and the
Estrada index, and we discuss the case of node removal. We propose a priori
bounds for these sensitivities which capture well the qualitative behavior and
give insight into the general behavior of matrix function based network indices
under perturbations. These bounds are based on decay results for Fr\'echet
derivatives of matrix functions with structured, low-rank direction terms which
might be of independent interest also for other applications than network
analysis.

details in tissue or single cells that are only visible at the highest
magnification. For a pathologist, this implies tedious zooming in and out,
while for a computational decision support algorithm, it leads to the analysis
of a huge number of small image patches per whole slide image (WSI).
Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL), where attention estimation is
learned in a weakly supervised manner, has been successfully applied in
computational histopathology, but it is challenged by large numbers of
irrelevant patches, reducing its accuracy. Here, we present an active learning
approach to the problem. Querying the expert to annotate regions of interest in
a WSI guides the formation of high-attention regions for MIL. We train an
attention-based MIL and calculate a confidence metric for every image in the
dataset to select the most uncertain WSIs for expert annotation. We test our
approach on the CAMELYON17 dataset classifying metastatic lymph node sections
in breast cancer. With a novel attention guiding loss, this leads to an
accuracy boost of the trained models with few regions annotated for each class.
Active learning thus improves WSIs classification accuracy, leads to faster and
more robust convergence, and speeds up the annotation process. It may in the
future serve as an important contribution to train MIL models in the clinically
relevant context of cancer classification in histopathology.

control systems (NCS) affected by variable time delays and data loss. A special
focus is put on the reduction of the computational complexity. A specific
buffering mechanism is defined first, such that it adds an additional delay up
to one sampling period. The resulting buffered NCS can then be formulated as a
switched system which leads to the significant simplification of the NCS model
and subsequent controller synthesis. The novel approach does not only
circumvent the need for any over-approximation technique, since the switched
NCS model can be used for stability analysis directly, but also reduces the
infinite set of allowable values of the dynamic matrix to a small finite set.
The proposed strategy leads hereby to a strongly decreased number of
optimization variables and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which allows
greater flexibility with respect to additional degrees of freedom affecting the
transient behavior. The performance and computational efficiency of the control

the significant number of samples required to obtain accurate policy gradients.
In this paper, instead of implicitly constraining policy search with

backpropagating through formal constraints, enabling training hierarchical
policies with substantially fewer training samples. The use of hierarchical
policies is recognized as a crucial component of reinforcement learning with
task constraints. We show that we can stably constrain policy updates, thus
enabling different levels of the policy to be learned simultaneously, yielding
superior performance compared with training them separately. Experiment results

However, the hardness of decoding makes the color codes not suitable as the
best candidate for experimentally feasible implementation of quantum error
correction. Here we propose a highly accurate decoding scheme for the color
codes using simulated annealing. In this scheme, we map stabilizer operators to
classical spin variables to represent an error satisfying the syndrome. Then we
construct an Ising Hamiltonian that counts the number of errors and formulate
the decoding problem as an energy minimization problem of an Ising Hamiltonian,
which is solved by simulated annealing. In numerical simulations on the (4.8.8)

18.47(5)% for depolarizing noise model, and 2.90(4)% for phenomenological noise
model, all of which are higher than the thresholds of existing efficient
decoding algorithms. Furthermore, we verify that the achieved logical error
rates are almost optimal in the sense that they are almost the same as those
obtained by exact optimizations by CPLEX with smaller decoding time in many

analysis, the proposed decoding method is useful for further exploration of the

limit corresponding to a magnetically arrested accretion onto a maximally

initial ballistic jet propagation in a surrounding cavity followed by a sudden
deceleration in interstellar medium under the assumption of its standard

exponential density growth separating the cavity and the interstellar medium.
In that case, the jet is found to decelerate mostly in the transition layer, in

higher-order interface that includes refinement types as well as pre- and
post-conditions about past IO events. The target language is a smaller F*
subset in which the compiled program is linked with an adversarial context via
an interface without refinement types or pre- and post-conditions. To bridge
this interface gap and make compilation and linking secure we propose a novel
combination of higher-order contracts and reference monitoring for recording

the logical assumptions the program makes about the context into dynamic checks
on each context-program boundary crossing. These boundary checks can depend on
information about past IO events stored in the monitor's state, yet these
checks cannot stop the adversarial target context before it performs dangerous
IO operations. So, additionally, our linking forces the context to perform all
IO via a secure IO library that uses reference monitoring to dynamically
enforce an access control policy before each IO operation. We propose a novel
way to model in F* that the context cannot directly access the IO operations

enforces a global trace property. Moreover, we prove in F* that our secure

  Estimation for Autonomous Navigation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, monocular depth estimation (MDE) has witnessed a substantial
performance improvement due to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However,
CNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose serious concerns for
safety-critical and security-sensitive systems. Specifically, adversarial
attacks can have catastrophic impact on MDE given its importance for scene
understanding in applications like autonomous driving and robotic navigation.
To physically assess the vulnerability of CNN-based depth prediction methods,
recent work tries to design adversarial patches against MDE. However, these
methods are not powerful enough to fully fool the vision system in a
systemically threatening manner. In fact, their impact is partial and locally
limited; they mislead the depth prediction of only the overlapping region with
the input image regardless of the target object size, shape and location. In
this paper, we investigate MDE vulnerability to adversarial patches in a more
comprehensive manner. We propose a novel adaptive adversarial patch (APARATE)
that is able to selectively jeopardize MDE by either corrupting the estimated
distance, or simply manifesting an object as disappeared for the autonomous
system. Specifically, APARATE is optimized to be shape and scale-aware, and its
impact adapts to the target object instead of being limited to the immediate
neighborhood. Our proposed patch achieves more than $14~meters$ mean depth
estimation error, with $99\%$ of the target region being affected. We believe
this work highlights the threat of adversarial attacks in the context of MDE,
and we hope it would alert the community to the real-life potential harm of
this attack and motivate investigating more robust and adaptive defenses for
autonomous robots.

periodic orbit into a family of non-integrable many-body Hamiltonians, whose
dynamics is otherwise chaotic. Our construction is based on time dependent
variational principle that projects quantum dynamics onto a manifold of
low-entangled states, and it generalizes the earlier approaches for embedding
non-thermal eigenstates, known as quantum many-body scars, into thermalizing
spectra. By designing terms that suppress ""leakage"" of the dynamics outside the
variational manifold, we engineer families of Floquet models that host exact
scarred dynamics, as we illustrate using a driven Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki
model and a recent experimental realization of scars in a dimerized

of cooperation and how it can be promoted is an ongoing challenge. One
mechanism for cooperation is indirect reciprocity. According to this mechanism,
individuals cooperate to maintain a good reputation. This idea is embodied in a
set of social norms called the ``leading eight''. When all information is
publicly available, these norms have two major properties. Populations that
employ these norms are fully cooperative, and they are stable against invasion
by alternative norms. In this paper, we extend the framework of the leading
eight in two directions. First, we allow social norms to be stochastic. Such
norms allow individuals to evaluate others with certain probabilities. Second,
we consider norms in which also the reputations of passive recipients can be
updated. Using this framework, we characterize all evolutionarily stable norms
that lead to full cooperation in the public information regime. When only the
donor's reputation is updated, and all updates are deterministic, we recover
the conventional model. In that case, we find two classes of stable norms: the
leading eight and the `secondary sixteen'. Stochasticity can further help to
stabilize cooperation when the benefit of cooperation is comparably small.
Moreover, updating the recipients' reputations can help populations to recover
more quickly from errors. Overall, our study highlights a remarkable trade-off
between the evolutionary stability of a norm and its robustness with respect to
errors. Norms that correct errors quickly require higher benefits of
cooperation to be stable.

recent years. However, adversarial audio examples can cause abnormal behaviors

methods, such as transformation-based defenses and adversarial training, have
been proposed to protect acoustic systems from adversarial attacks, but they
are less effective against adaptive attacks. Furthermore, directly applying the
methods from the image domain can lead to suboptimal results because of the
unique properties of audio data. In this paper, we propose an adversarial
purification-based defense pipeline, AudioPure, for acoustic systems via
off-the-shelf diffusion models. Taking advantage of the strong generation
ability of diffusion models, AudioPure first adds a small amount of noise to
the adversarial audio and then runs the reverse sampling step to purify the
noisy audio and recover clean audio. AudioPure is a plug-and-play method that
can be directly applied to any pretrained classifier without any fine-tuning or
re-training. We conduct extensive experiments on speech command recognition
task to evaluate the robustness of AudioPure. Our method is effective against
diverse adversarial attacks (e.g. $\mathcal{L}_2$ or
$\mathcal{L}_\infty$-norm). It outperforms the existing methods under both
strong adaptive white-box and black-box attacks bounded by $\mathcal{L}_2$ or

evaluate the certified robustness for perturbations bounded by
$\mathcal{L}_2$-norm via randomized smoothing. Our pipeline achieves a higher

multiple vehicles is to travel to maximize the sum of collected profits under
resource (e.g., time, fuel) consumption constraints. Such re-planning problems
occur in a wide range of intelligent UAS applications where changes in the
mission environment force the operation of multiple vehicles to change from the
original plan. To solve this problem with deep reinforcement learning (RL), we
develop a policy network with self-attention on each partial tour and
encoder-decoder attention between the partial tour and the remaining nodes. We
propose a modified REINFORCE algorithm where the greedy rollout baseline is
replaced by a local mini-batch baseline based on multiple, possibly
non-duplicate sample rollouts. By drawing multiple samples per training
instance, we can learn faster and obtain a stable policy gradient estimator
with significantly fewer instances. The proposed training algorithm outperforms
the conventional greedy rollout baseline, even when combined with the maximum
entropy objective.

propose a novel self-supervised framework ACL-SPC for point cloud completion to

our proposed ACL-SPC on various datasets to prove that it can successfully
learn to complete a partial point cloud as the first self-supervised scheme.
Results show that our method is comparable with unsupervised methods and
achieves superior performance on the real-world dataset compared to the

from the author's school and was divided into two experimental groups (A and B)
and a control group (C). The study aimed to improve students' mathematical
computation ability through algorithm analysis and comparison. The results
showed that after a long period of practice, there was an improvement in
students' computational ability, and most students could reach the level of
high school mathematical computation ability. However, further research is
needed to determine how to achieve level three of mathematical computation
ability.
  The study found that students' computational ability levels were similar in
the experimental and control groups at the beginning of the study. Through
targeted discussion courses, students' computational ability levels were
improved. The degree of improvement was not significantly related to students'
gender but had a moderate positive correlation with the number of times
students participated in related discussions.
  Based on the practical results, the author proposes several suggestions to
help teachers improve students' mathematical computation ability. Firstly,
students' interest in learning computation can be stimulated by arousing their
curiosity, using typical problems to motivate their interest, and encouraging
their participation. Secondly, teachers should pay more attention to selecting
typical problems to help students better understand computational logic.
Lastly, in addition to understanding computational logic, teachers should also
focus on developing students' mathematical thinking quality, enabling students
to select optimal computational strategies and improve their algorithm
selection abilities.

regime. For all conformally flat spacetimes and spacetimes with a maximally

General Relativity. Specifically, the Anti-de Sitter (A)dS-Kerr/Kerr black hole
is not a solution for Chern-Simons gravity. The slow-rotating BH and the
quadratic order in spin solutions are some of the known solutions to quadratic
order in spin and they are rotating solutions in the frame of dynamical

non-hateful. We fine-tuned two transformer-based models using RoBERTa, XLNET,
and GPT-3 and used deep learning interpretation techniques to provide
explanations for the classification results. ToxVis enables users to input
potentially hateful text and receive a classification result along with a
visual explanation of which words contributed most to the decision. By making
the classification process explainable, ToxVis provides a valuable tool for
understanding the nuances of hateful content and supporting more effective
content moderation. Our research contributes to the growing body of work aimed
at mitigating the harms caused by online hate speech and demonstrates the
potential for combining state-of-the-art natural language processing models
with interpretable deep learning techniques to address this critical issue.
Finally, ToxVis can serve as a resource for content moderators, social media
platforms, and researchers working to combat the spread of hate speech online.

  Event-Driven Architecture from Traditional Architecture using Agile
  Frameworks: A Case study of Bimodal operational strategy",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proposing and implementing software systems, especially web applications for
e-commerce using the traditional monolithic approach has been the norm,
however, as new user requirements force organisations and developers to add
more functionalities to their systems, and as user demands increases, the
performance of monolith applications decreases, and maintenance costs rise.
These issues have necessitated a need for a better system and that is where
Microservices event-driven applications come in. This thesis investigates the
scopeand impact of migrating to Microservices, using agile frameworks, and
bi-modal ITstrategy. To obtain quantitative data for analysis, prototypes of
monolith and microservice websites were integrated with Dropwizard, an open
source metrics, and Apache JMeter, and response time and error rate readings
were collected. Results showed that monoliths have a faster response time when
the number of user request calls is within tolerant range, better than
Microservices, but as complexity grows over time and there is increased user
requestcalls, Microservices appears to perform better.

  Series",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Irregularly sampled time series are becoming increasingly prevalent in
various domains, especially in medical applications. Although different
highly-customized methods have been proposed to tackle irregularity, how to
effectively model their complicated dynamics and high sparsity is still an open
problem. This paper studies the problem from a whole new perspective:
transforming irregularly sampled time series into line graph images and
adapting powerful vision transformers to perform time series classification in
the same way as image classification. Our approach largely simplifies algorithm
designs without assuming prior knowledge and can be potentially extended as a
general-purpose framework. Despite its simplicity, we show that it
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art specialized algorithms on several
popular healthcare and human activity datasets. Especially in the challenging
leave-sensors-out setting where a subset of variables is masked during testing,
the performance improvement is up to 54.0\% in absolute F1 score points. Our

growing use of less secure IoT devices. The risk of attacks on an
organization's network has also increased due to the bring your own device
(BYOD) policy which permits employees to bring IoT devices onto the premises
and attach them to the organization's network. To tackle this threat and
protect their networks, organizations generally implement security policies in
which only white listed IoT devices are allowed on the organization's network.
To monitor compliance with such policies, it has become essential to
distinguish IoT devices permitted within an organization's network from non
white listed (unknown) IoT devices. In this research, deep learning is applied
to network communication for the automated identification of IoT devices
permitted on the network. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed
approach does not require complex feature engineering of the network
communication, because the 'communication behavior' of IoT devices is
represented as small images which are generated from the device's network
communication payload. The proposed approach is applicable for any IoT device,
regardless of the protocol used for communication. As our approach relies on
the network communication payload, it is also applicable for the IoT devices
behind a network address translation (NAT) enabled router. In this study, we
trained various classifiers on a publicly accessible dataset to identify IoT
devices in different scenarios, including the identification of known and
unknown IoT devices, achieving over 99% overall average detection accuracy.

the accuracy and efficiency of CT diagnosis. The accuracy and robustness of
deep learning models. Method:In this paper, we explore (1) the data
augmentation method based on the generation model and (2) the model structure
improvement method based on the embedding mechanism. Two strategies have been
introduced in this study: a new data augmentation method and a embedding
mechanism. In the augmentation method, a 3D pixel-level statistics algorithm is
proposed to generate pulmonary nodule and by combing the faked pulmonary nodule
and healthy lung, we generate new pulmonary nodule samples. The embedding
mechanism are designed to better understand the meaning of pixels of the
pulmonary nodule samples by introducing hidden variables. Result: The result of
the 3DVNET model with the augmentation method for pulmonary nodule detection
shows that the proposed data augmentation method outperforms the method based
on generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, training accuracy improved
by 1.5%, and with embedding mechanism for pulmonary nodules classification
shows that the embedding mechanism improves the accuracy and robustness for the
classification of pulmonary nodules obviously, the model training accuracy is
close to 1 and the model testing F1-score is 0.90.Conclusion:he proposed data
augmentation method and embedding mechanism are beneficial to improve the
accuracy and robustness of the model, and can be further applied in other

of formal method experts as a platform for construction and (formal)
verification of proofs. The complexity of the proofs in conjunction with the
level of expertise typically required for the process to succeed can often
hinder the adoption of ITPs. A recent strain of work has investigated methods
to incorporate machine learning models trained on ITP user activity traces as a
viable path towards full automation. While a valuable line of investigation,
many problems still require human supervision to be completed fully, thus
applying learning methods to assist the user with useful recommendations can
prove more fruitful.
  Following the vein of user assistance, we introduce CoProver, a proof
recommender system based on transformers, capable of learning from past actions
during proof construction, all while exploring knowledge stored in the ITP
concerning previous proofs. CoProver employs a neurally learnt sequence-based
encoding of sequents, capturing long distance relationships between terms and
hidden cues therein. We couple CoProver with the Prototype Verification System
(PVS) and evaluate its performance on two key areas, namely: (1) Next Proof
Action Recommendation, and (2) Relevant Lemma Retrieval given a library of
theories. We evaluate CoProver on a series of well-established metrics
originating from the recommender system and information retrieval communities,
respectively. We show that CoProver successfully outperforms prior state of the
art applied to recommendation in the domain. We conclude by discussing future
directions viable for CoProver (and similar approaches) such as argument
prediction, proof summarization, and more.

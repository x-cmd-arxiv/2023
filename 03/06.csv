performances in various vision tasks, overshadowing the conventional CNN-based
models. This ignites a few recent striking-back research in the CNN world
showing that pure CNN models can achieve as good performance as ViT models when
carefully tuned. While encouraging, designing such high-performance CNN models
is challenging, requiring non-trivial prior knowledge of network design. To
this end, a novel framework termed Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep
CNN (DeepMAD) is proposed to design high-performance CNN models in a principled
way. In DeepMAD, a CNN network is modeled as an information processing system
whose expressiveness and effectiveness can be analytically formulated by their
structural parameters. Then a constrained mathematical programming (MP) problem
is proposed to optimize these structural parameters. The MP problem can be
easily solved by off-the-shelf MP solvers on CPUs with a small memory
footprint. In addition, DeepMAD is a pure mathematical framework: no GPU or
training data is required during network design. The superiority of DeepMAD is
validated on multiple large-scale computer vision benchmark datasets. Notably
on ImageNet-1k, only using conventional convolutional layers, DeepMAD achieves
0.7% and 1.5% higher top-1 accuracy than ConvNeXt and Swin on Tiny level, and
0.8% and 0.9% higher on Small level.

ionizing emissivity is the escape fraction of photons from star-forming
galaxies. Several theoretical and observational studies have been conducted
over the past few years, but consensus regarding its redshift evolution has yet
to be achieved. We present here the first non-parametric reconstruction of this
parameter as a function of redshift from a data-driven reionization model using
a Gaussian Process Regression method. Our finding suggests a mild redshift
evolution of escape fraction with a mean value of $4\%,7\%,\sim10\%$ at
$z=2,6,12$. However, a constant escape fraction of $6-10\%$ at $z\gtrsim 6$ is
still allowed by current data and also matches other reionization-related
observations. With the detection of fainter high redshift galaxies from
upcoming observations of JWST, the approach presented here will be a robust
tool to put the most stringent constraint on escape fraction as well as
reionization histories.

Our simulations indicate that in this system the molecules could interact with

propagating surface plasmons cancel largely the direct dipole-dipole coupling
mediated by the free-space field, and the dominated dissipative coupling
mediated by relatively long-ranged gap plasmons enables the ultrafast
superradiant pulses within picosecond scale. Our study opens up the possibility
of studying the rich superradiant effects from the quantum emitters in a
sub-wavelength volumn by engineering the plasmonic environments.

further pre-train GPT-2 to analyze industry trends with current affairs

rearrangement inequality on the circle and the variational method. We
investigate the variational problem of the functional $\mathcal{F}[v] =
\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} [4(v')^2 - v^2] \mathrm{d} \theta$ under the constraint
$\int_{\mathbb{S}^1} v^{-2} \mathrm{d} \theta = 2\pi$. An important geometric
insight of the functional $\mathcal{F}$ is that it is invariant under the
Lorentz group, since $\mathcal{F}[v]$ is the integral of the product of two
null expansions of a spacelike curve parameterised by the function $v^{-2}$ in
a lightcone in $3$-dim Minkowski spacetime. The global minimiser of
$\mathcal{F}$ under the constraint is simply given by the spacelike plane
section of the lightcone. We introduce a method which combines the symmetric
decreasing rearrangement and the Lorentz transformation. This method isnot
confined to the scope of this paper, but is applicable to other Lorentz

in the last decade, which was missed at other wavelengths due to dust
obscuration, hinting at the existence of TDEs that have been historically
overlooked. Unlike most previously detected TDEs, the transient was discovered
in a star forming galaxy, corroborating earlier suggestions that dust
obscuration suppresses significantly the detection of TDEs in these

critical in order to obtain a complete understanding of the physics of TDEs,
and to conclude whether TDEs occur preferentially in a particular class of
galaxies.

we study the performance of structure-guided query evaluation in three
architecturally distinct DBMSs by rewriting SQL queries into a sequence of SQL
statements that express an execution of Yannakakis' algorithm. Moreover, we
identify a class of queries that is particularly well suited for our approach
and allows query answering in a variety of common scenarios without
materializing any join. Through empirical evaluation we show that
structure-guided query evaluation can make the evaluation of many difficult
join queries feasible whereas their evaluation requires a prohibitive amount of
time and memory on current DBMSs.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. The multi-agent structure addresses the
major concern of data-hungry in traditional RL, while the federated mechanism
protects the data privacy of individual agents. However, the federated
mechanism also exposes the system to poisoning by malicious agents that can
mislead the trained policy. Despite the advantage brought by FL, the
vulnerability of Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) has not been
well-studied before. In this work, we propose the first general framework to
characterize FRL poisoning as an optimization problem constrained by a limited
budget and design a poisoning protocol that can be applied to policy-based FRL
and extended to FRL with actor-critic as a local RL algorithm by training a
pair of private and public critics. We also discuss a conventional defense
strategy inherited from FL to mitigate this risk. We verify our poisoning
effectiveness by conducting extensive experiments targeting mainstream RL
algorithms and over various RL OpenAI Gym environments covering a wide range of
difficulty levels. Our results show that our proposed defense protocol is
successful in most cases but is not robust under complicated environments. Our
work provides new insights into the vulnerability of FL in RL training and
poses additional challenges for designing robust FRL algorithms.

relativistic massive particle enjoying the deformed Poincare symmetry, using
the first order form of geometric Lagrangian, that satisfies a new deformed
dispersion relation and explored a feasible regime of a future Quantum Gravity
theory in which the momentum space becomes curved. In this scenario there is
only a mass scale (Planck mass $m_{p}$), but no length scale. Finally, we
relate the deformed mass shell to the geodesic distance in this curved momentum
space, where the mass of the particle gets renormalized as a result of
noncommutativity. We show, that under some circumstances, the Planck mass

Polarimetry Explorer. The 2-8 keV polarization degree is 8 % at a position
angle of $18^\circ$, with the polarization degree increasing significantly with
energy, from ~6 % at ~2 keV to ~ 11 % at ~8 keV. The continuum emission in the
spectrum of simultaneous observations with the Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer, NICER, is well described with only a thermal disc
spectrum, with stringent upper limits to any Comptonized emission from the
corona. Together with the lack of significant variability in the Fourier power
spectrum, this suggests that the source was in the high-soft state at the time
of these observations. The NICER spectrum reveals the presence of several
absorption lines in the 6-9 keV band that we fit with two ionized absorbers,
providing evidence of the presence of a strong disk wind, which supports the
idea that the source was in the soft state. Previous measurements of X-ray
polarization in other sources in harder states were associated with the corona
or the jet in those systems. Given that the corona is significantly absent in
this observation of 4U 1630-47, and that the jet in black-hole binaries is
quenched in the high-soft state, we speculate that in this observation of 4U
1630-47, the polarization likely arises from the direct and reflected radiation
of the accretion disk in this source.

stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Following the central limit theorem, SGN was
initially modeled as Gaussian, and lately, it has been suggested that
stochastic gradient noise is better characterized using $S\alpha S$ L\'evy
distribution. This claim was allegedly refuted and rebounded to the previously
suggested Gaussian noise model. This paper presents solid, detailed empirical
evidence that SGN is heavy-tailed and better depicted by the $S\alpha S$
distribution. Furthermore, we argue that different parameters in a deep neural
network (DNN) hold distinct SGN characteristics throughout training. To more
accurately approximate the dynamics of SGD near a local minimum, we construct a
novel framework in $\mathbb{R}^N$, based on L\'evy-driven stochastic
differential equation (SDE), where one-dimensional L\'evy processes model each
parameter in the DNN. Next, we show that SGN jump intensity (frequency and
amplitude) depends on the learning rate decay mechanism (LRdecay); furthermore,
we demonstrate empirically that the LRdecay effect may stem from the reduction
of the SGN and not the decrease in the step size. Based on our analysis, we
examine the mean escape time, trapping probability, and more properties of DNNs
near local minima. Finally, we prove that the training process will likely exit
from the basin in the direction of parameters with heavier tail SGN. We will
share our code for reproducibility.

containing spacelike singularities \cite{Barbon:2015ria, Bolognesi:2018ion,
Caputa:2021pad}. In this work, we turn our attention to the quantum complexity
of CFT/quantum gravity states which represent bulk geometries containing a
naked timelike singularity. The appearance of naked timelike singularities in
semiclassical limit is allowed in string theory, particularly in the context of
holography, so long as they satisfy the \emph{Gubser criterion}
\cite{Gubser:2000nd, Gursoy:2008za} - naked timelike singularities which arise
in the extremal limits of geometries containing cloaked singularities are
admissible. In this work, we formulate a criterion for the appearance of naked
timelike singularities based on holographic complexity. We study three cases of
naked timelike singularities, namely the negative mass Schwarzschild-AdS
spacetime, the timelike Kasner-AdS \cite{Ren:2016xhb} and Einstein-dilaton
system \cite{Ren:2019lgw}. The first two cases are ruled out by the Gubser
criterion while the third case is more subtle - as per Gubser criterion the
singularity switches from forbidden to admissible as the parameter $\alpha$ is
dialed in the range $[0,1]$ across the transition point $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{3}$.
We probe all three geometries using two holographic complexity prescriptions,
namely CA and CV. We propose a simple criterion that if the holographic
complexity of a geometry with naked timelike singularities is less than that of
empty AdS, then that singularity cannot arise in the semiclassical limit of a
UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. Our study strongly suggests that action
complexity (CA) is a sensitive tool to investigate timelike singularities,
being in sync with Gubser criterion in all cases. On the other hand volume
complexity (CV) turns out to be not a reliable tool to probe timelike
singularities.

upon the compression ratio the compressed images/videos suffer from different
distortions. At low ratios, blurriness is observed and as compression increases
blocking artifacts occur. Generally, in order to reduce blockiness, images are
low-pass filtered which leads to more blurriness. Also, in bokeh mode images
they are commonly seen: blurriness as a result of intentional blurred
background while blocking artifact and global blurriness arising due to
compression. Therefore, such visual media suffer from both blockiness and
blurriness distortions. Along with this, noise is also commonly encountered
distortion. Most of the existing works on quality assessment quantify these
distortions individually. This paper proposes a methodology to blindly measure
overall quality of an image suffering from these distortions, individually as
well as jointly. This is achieved by considering the sum of absolute values of
low and high-frequency Discrete Frequency Transform (DFT) coefficients defined
as sum magnitudes. The number of blocks lying in specific ranges of sum
magnitudes including zero-valued AC coefficients and mean of 100 maximum and
100 minimum values of these sum magnitudes are used as feature vectors. These
features are then fed to the Machine Learning (ML) based Gaussian Process
Regression (GPR) model, which quantifies the image quality. The simulation
results show that the proposed method can estimate the quality of images
distorted with the blockiness, blurriness, noise and their combinations. It is
relatively fast compared to many state-of-art methods, and therefore is
suitable for real-time quality monitoring applications.

of independent degrees of freedom, impose new angular symmetries, and eliminate
cosmic variance for purely angular 2-point correlations. Distortions of causal
structure from vacuum fluctuations are modeled as gravitational memory from
randomly oriented outgoing and incoming gravitational null shocks, with
nonlocally coherent directional displacements on curved surfaces of causal
diamonds formed by standard inflationary horizons. The angular distribution is
determined by axially symmetric shock displacements on circular intersections
of the comoving sphere that represents the CMB photosphere with other
inflationary horizons. Displacements on thin spheres at the end of inflation
have a unique angular power spectrum $C_\ell$ that approximates the standard
expectation on small angular scales, but differs substantially at large angular
scales due to horizon curvature. For a thin sphere, the model predicts a
universal angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ with an exact ``causal
shadow'' symmetry, $C(\pi/4<\Theta<3\pi/4)= 0$, and significant large-angle

well-established that convergent migration is necessary for mean-motion
commensurabilities to emerge, recent numerical experiments have shown that the
existing adiabatic theory of resonant capture provides an incomplete
description of the relevant physics, leading to an erroneous mass scaling in
the regime of strong dissipation. In this work, we develop a new model for
resonance capture that self-consistently accounts for migration and
circularization of planetary orbits, and derive an analytic criterion based
upon stability analysis that describes the conditions necessary for the
formation of mean-motion resonances. We subsequently test our results against
numerical simulations and find satisfactory agreement. Our results elucidate
the critical role played by adiabaticity and resonant stability in shaping the
orbital architectures of planetary systems during the nebular epoch, and
provide a valuable tool for understanding their primordial dynamical evolution.

$m_{1}\in \lbrack 2.516,21.351]$ $m{eV}$. Additionally, the model predicts a
non-zero value of the reactor angle $\theta _{13}$ while the atmospheic angle
$\theta _{23}$ lies in the lower octant. We explore the phenomenological

place within the allowed parameter space obtained from neutrino phenomenology.
Moreover, interesting correlations between $Y_{B}$ and low-energy observables

hot molecular cores (HMCs). HMC1 is part of a mm continuum ring-like structure,
is closest in projection to the protostar, has the highest temperature of
$\sim300\:$K, and shows the most line-rich spectra. HMC2 is on the other side
of the ring, has a temperature of $\sim250\:$K, and is of intermediate chemical
complexity. HMC3 is further away, $\sim3,000\:$au in projection, cooler
($\sim70\:$K) and is the least line-rich. The three HMCs have similar mass
surface densities ($\sim10\:{\rm{g\:cm}}^{-2}$), number densities ($n_{\rm

in the cores and in the region out to $3,000\:$au is $\sim 25\:M_\odot$, which
is comparable to that of the central protostar. Based on spatial distributions
of peak line intensities as a function of excitation energy, we infer that the
HMCs are externally heated by the protostar. We estimate column densities and
abundances of the detected species and discuss the implications for hot core

Mask-wearing is crucial in preventing the spread of pathogen-containing

project has four stages: setup optimization, data collection, data analysis,
and application development. The metrology was initially developed in a dark
closet as a proof of concept using common household materials and was
subsequently implemented into a portable apparatus. Tonic water and UV
darklight tube lights are selected to visualize fluorescent droplet and aerosol
propagation with automated analysis developed using open-source software. The
dependencies of oral fluid droplet generation and propagation on various
factors are studied in detail and established using this metrology.
Additionally, the smallest detectable droplet size was mathematically
correlated to height and airborne time. The efficacy of different types of
masks is evaluated and associated with fabric microstructures. It is found that
masks with smaller-sized pores and thicker material are more effective. This
technique can easily be constructed at home using materials that total to a
cost of below \$60, thereby enabling a low-cost and accurate metrology.

to train examples. However, real-world applications are required to perform on
any distribution of test examples. Current ML systems can fail silently on test
examples with distribution shifts. In order to improve reliability of ML models
due to covariate or domain shift, we propose algorithms that enable models to:
(a) generalize to a larger family of test distributions, (b) evaluate accuracy
under distribution shifts, (c) adapt to a target distribution. We study causes
of impaired robustness to domain shifts and present algorithms for training
domain robust models. A key source of model brittleness is due to domain
overfitting, which our new training algorithms suppress and instead encourage
domain-general hypotheses. While we improve robustness over standard training
methods for certain problem settings, performance of ML systems can still vary
drastically with domain shifts. It is crucial for developers and stakeholders
to understand model vulnerabilities and operational ranges of input, which
could be assessed on the fly during the deployment, albeit at a great cost.
Instead, we advocate for proactively estimating accuracy surfaces over any
combination of prespecified and interpretable domain shifts for performance
forecasting. We present a label-efficient estimation to address estimation over
a combinatorial space of domain shifts. Further, when a model's performance on
a target domain is found to be poor, traditional approaches adapt the model
using the target domain's resources. Standard adaptation methods assume access
to sufficient labeled resources, which may be impractical for deployed models.
We initiate a study of lightweight adaptation techniques with only unlabeled

divalent cations. How Mg$^{2+}$ ions direct the folding kinetics is a
long-standing unsolved problem because experiments cannot detect the positions
and dynamics of ions as the ribozyme assembles. To solve this problem, we used
molecular simulations to dissect the folding kinetics of the Azoarcus ribozyme
by monitoring the path each molecule takes to reach the folded state. We
establish quantitatively that Mg$^{2+}$ binding to specific sites, coupled with
counter-ion release of monovalent cations, stimulate the formation of secondary
and tertiary structures, leading to diverse pathways that include direct rapid
folding and trapping in a manifold of misfolded structures. Assembly of the
Azoarcus ribozyme begins only after Mg$^{2+}$ ions condense onto RNA,
displacing the monovalent cations in the process. In some molecules, key
tertiary structural elements form when Mg$^{2+}$ ions bind to specific RNA
sites, at the earliest stages of the folding, leading to specific collapse and
rapid formation of the folded structure. In others, the formation of non-native
base pairs, whose rearrangement is needed to reach the folded state, is the
rate-limiting step. Escape from energetic traps, driven by thermal
fluctuations, occurs readily. In contrast, the transition to the native state
from long-lived topologically trapped native-like metastable states is
extremely slow. Specific collapse and formation of energetically or
topologically frustrated states occur early in the assembly process.

large heterogeneous environments, which in plane-wave simulations has a direct

for a larger simulation cell to be used for the environment, without

simulations covering Reynolds numbers $Re_B=UD/\nu$ between $[10 000, 50 000]$
and Froude number $Fr_B=U_B/ND$ between $[2, 50]$ ($U_B$ is the freestream

wake width, but decreases in the vertical direction, opposite to the wake
height. The meandering, especially in the horizontal direction, leads to the
dispersion of the instantaneous velocity and layered flow structures. Thus, the
mean velocity profile deviates from the assumption of two-dimensional
self-similarity in the late wake. Due to the distortion of the mean velocity
profile, the superposition of the meandering to the stationary velocity is
non-trivial. The scaling of the width and the height transitions at different

Through theoretical analysis, we obtain and verify the momentum flux equation.
We can accurately measure the impact of the meandering on the scaling of the

reference using the beat frequency of the signal and idler fields from a
microresonator-based optical parametric oscillator (OPO), which achieves high
phase stability due to the inherently strong signal-idler frequency
correlations. We implement OFD by optically injecting the signal and idler
fields from the OPO to a Kerr-comb microresonator on the same chip. We show
that the two distinct dynamical states of Kerr cavities can be passively

transfers the stability of the OPO frequencies to the repetition rate of the
Kerr comb. A 630-fold phase-noise reduction is observed when the Kerr comb is

sawtooth lattice antiferromagnet consisting of Cr$^{3+}$ are experimentally
identified in this work, thereby proposing the scenario of magnetism-driven
ferroelectricity in a sawtooth lattice. The title compound, BeCr$_2$O$_4$,
displays three magnetic phase transitions at low temperatures, at
$T_{N1}\approx$ 7.5 K, at $T_{N2}\approx$ 25 K and at $T_{N3}\approx$ 26 K,
revealed through magnetic susceptibility, specific heat and neutron diffraction
in this work. These magnetic phase transitions are found to be influenced by
externally applied magnetic fields. Isothermal magnetization curves at low
temperatures below the magnetic transitions indicate the antiferromagnetic
nature of \bco\ with two spin-flop-like transitions occurring at
$H_{c1}\approx$ 29 kOe and $H_{c2} \approx$ 47 kOe. Our high-resolution X-ray
and neutron diffraction studies, performed on single crystal and powder samples
unambiguously determined the crystal structure as orthorhombic $Pbnm$. By
performing the magnetic superspace group analysis of the neutron diffraction
data at low temperatures, the magnetic structure in the temperature range
$T_{N3,N2} < T < T_{N1}$ is determined to be the polar magnetic space group,
$P21nm.1^{\prime}(00g)0s0s$ with a cycloidal magnetic propagation vector
$\textbf{k}_1$ = (0, 0, 0.090(1)). The magnetic structure in the newly
identified phase below $T_{N1}$, is determined as $P21/b.1^{\prime}[b](00g)00s$
with the magnetic propagation vector $\textbf{k}_2$ = (0, 0, 0.908(1)). The
cycloidal spin structure determined in our work is usually associated with
electric polarization, thereby making \bco\ a promising multiferroic belonging
to the sparsely populated family of sawtooth lattice antiferromagnets.

adversarial attacks raises serious concerns about the robustness of CNNs, and

which neurons are more vulnerable to attacks and (2) which image features do
these vulnerable neurons capture during the prediction? For the first question,
we introduce multiple perturbation-based measures to break down the attacking

a large number of neurons by aiding with hierarchical clustering based on the
neurons' roles in the prediction. To this end, a visual analytics system is
designed to incorporate visual reasoning for interpreting adversarial attacks.

$z\sim$ 6 quasars, of which 30 come from the ESO Large Program XQR-30. The

2.0 over the ~300 Myr interval between $z\sim$ 4.7 and $z\sim$ 5.8. The slope
of the column density (log N) distribution function does not change, suggesting
that CIV absorption is suppressed approximately uniformly across 13.2 $\leq$

heavy-tailed nature of macroeconomic and financial data is often neglected in

propose an approach to estimate factor loadings and scores by minimizing the
Huber loss function, which is motivated by the equivalence of conventional
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the constrained least squares method in
the factor model. We provide two algorithms that use different penalty forms.
The first algorithm, which we refer to as Huber PCA, minimizes the
$\ell_2$-norm-type Huber loss and performs PCA on the weighted sample
covariance matrix. The second algorithm involves an element-wise type Huber
loss minimization, which can be solved by an iterative Huber regression
algorithm. Our study examines the theoretical minimizer of the element-wise
Huber loss function and demonstrates that it has the same convergence rate as
conventional PCA when the idiosyncratic errors have bounded second moments. We
also derive their asymptotic distributions under mild conditions. Moreover, we
suggest a consistent model selection criterion that relies on rank minimization
to estimate the number of factors robustly. We showcase the benefits of Huber
PCA through extensive numerical experiments and a real financial portfolio
selection example. An R package named ``HDRFA"" has been developed to implement
the proposed robust factor analysis.

small molecules at the center of cell-sized droplets than that in bulk
solutions. This heterogeneous distribution is observed when longer polymers
with lower wettability are localized at the droplet center. Molecular
simulations support this wetting-induced heterogeneous distribution by polymer

emerges as a result of the subtle interplay between magnetism, lattice

algorithm is proved to be uniquely solvable and unconditionally energy stable,
further, the numerical solution is shown to be bounded in the maximum norm. The
proposed scheme is rigorously proved to be convergent in $L^2$ norm by the
discrete orthogonal convolution (DOC) kernel, which transfer the
four-level-solution form into the three-level-gradient form for the
approximation of the temporal derivative. Consequently, the error estimate for
the numerical solution is established by utilization of the discrete Gronwall

implementing original gates. Experimental results on both IBM QX5 and IBM QX20

network and a self-pruned network, and these two networks are optimized
simultaneously via contrastive learning. Concretely, we employ the Variational
Information Bottleneck (VIB) principle to learn an informative and compressed
network (self-pruned network) from the original network, which discards the
superfluous patterns or spurious correlations between input features and
prediction labels. Then, self-pruning contrastive learning is devised to pull
together semantically similar positive pairs and push away dissimilar pairs,
where the representations of the anchor learned by the original and self-pruned
networks respectively are regarded as a positive pair while the representations
of two different sentences within a mini-batch are treated as a negative pair.
To verify the effectiveness of our CVIB method, we conduct extensive
experiments on five benchmark ABSA datasets and the experimental results show
that our approach achieves better performance than the strong competitors in
terms of overall prediction performance, robustness, and generalization.

charge-density wave (CDW) with a large thermal hysteresis in the resistivity
and CDW gap. In this work, we systematically study the electronic structure and
transport properties of EuTe4 using high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetoresistance measurements, and
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We observe a CDW gap of about 200 meV at
low temperatures that persists up to 400 K, suggesting that the CDW transition
occurs at a much higher temperature. We observe a large thermal hysteretic
behavior of the ARPES intensity near the Fermi level, consistent with the
resistivity measurement. The hysteresis in the resistivity measurement does not
change under a magnetic field up to 7 T, excluding the thermal magnetic
hysteresis mechanism. Instead, the surface topography measured with STM shows
surface domains with different CDW trimerization directions, which may be
important for the thermal hysteretic behavior of EuTe4. Interestingly, we
observe a large negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures that can be
associated with the canting of magnetically ordered Eu spins. Our work shed
light on the understanding of magnetic, transport, and electronic properties of
EuTe4.

introduce matrix algebra for determination of both diagrams and asymptotic

finiteness mostly through automated deductions. For the planar six-body

real-world applications, ranging from object tracking to video surveillance.
Dynamic backgrounds poses a significant challenge here. Supervised deep
learning-based techniques are currently considered state-of-the-art for this

be time-consuming and expensive. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised
framework that can perform background subtraction without requiring per-pixel
ground-truth labels. Our framework is trained on a moving object-free sequence
of images and comprises two networks. The first network is an autoencoder that
generates background images and prepares dynamic background images for training
the second network. The dynamic background images are obtained by thresholding
the background-subtracted images. The second network is a U-Net that uses the
same object-free video for training and the dynamic background images as
pixel-wise ground-truth labels. During the test phase, the input images are
processed by the autoencoder and U-Net, which generate background and dynamic
background images, respectively. The dynamic background image helps remove
dynamic motion from the background-subtracted image, enabling us to obtain a
foreground image that is free of dynamic artifacts. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on selected categories of
the CDnet 2014 dataset and the I2R dataset. Our method outperformed all
top-ranked unsupervised methods. We also achieved better results than one of
the two existing weakly supervised methods, and our performance was similar to
the other. Our proposed method is online, real-time, efficient, and requires
minimal frame-level annotation, making it suitable for a wide range of

a novel method called Dual Feedback Attention Framework via Boundary-Aware

covariant cubic, quartic, $e$-tic interaction vertices for irreducible higher
spin fields on $d$-dimensional Minkowski space. We consider two different cases
for interacting integer higher spin fields both with massless and with massive
fields. The deformation procedure to find minimal (determined with help of
generalized Hilbert space) BRST-BV action for interacting higher spin fields is
based on the preservation of master equation validity in each power of coupling
constant $g$ starting from the Lagrangian formulation for free gauge theory. As
examples we consider the construction of local cubic vertices for $k$
irreducible massless fields of integer helicities, and $k-1$ massless with one
massive fields of spins $s_1, ,..., s_{k-1}, s_k$. For triple of two massless
scalars and tensor field of integer spin the BRST-BV action with cubic
interaction is explicitly found. Unlike the previous results on cubic vertices
we follow our result for BRST approach [arXiv:2105.12030[hep-th]] for massless
fields, but for the unique BRST-BV action instead of classical action with
reducible gauge transformations. The procedure is based on the complete BRST
operator, including the trace constraints that is used to formulate an
irreducible representation with definite integer spin.

(where antiskyrmions have $Q<0$) in the Pd/Fe/Ir(111) system, which we model
using a classical atomistic spin Hamiltonian based on parameters computed from

we make use of the newly developed Segment Anything Model (SAM). Spin textures
with $Q$ ranging from $-3$ to $-6$ are further analyzed using
finite-temperature spin-dynamics simulations. We observe that for temperatures

these textures decay, new topological spin textures are formed. We also find
that the relative stability of the spin textures depend linearly on the
topological charge, but only when comparing the most stable antiskyrmions for
each topological charge. In general, the number of holes (i.e.,
non-self-intersecting curves that define closed domain walls in the structure)
in the spin texture is an important predictor of stability -- the more holes,

eikonal limit for high frequency quasinormal modes and their connection to the
black holes geometric characteristics. To study the photon sphere, quasinormal

lower value for charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity

Cauchy's interlace theorem, we derive the globally optimal beamforming solution

sum-rate and weighted minimum-mean-squared-error (MMSE) to reformulate the

convergence to a locally optimal beamforming design. Numerical results validate

  Feedback",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Is it possible for machines to think like humans? And if it is, how should we
go about teaching them to do so? As early as 1950, Alan Turing stated that we
ought to teach machines in the way of teaching a child. Reinforcement learning
with human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a strong candidate toward allowing
agents to learn from human feedback in a naturalistic manner. RLHF is distinct
from traditional reinforcement learning as it provides feedback from a human
teacher in addition to a reward signal. It has been catapulted into public view
by multiple high-profile AI applications, including OpenAI's ChatGPT,
DeepMind's Sparrow, and Anthropic's Claude. These highly capable chatbots are
already overturning our understanding of how AI interacts with humanity. The
wide applicability and burgeoning success of RLHF strongly motivate the need to
evaluate its social impacts. In light of recent developments, this paper
considers an important question: can RLHF be developed and used without
negatively affecting human societies? Our objectives are threefold: to provide
a systematic study of the social effects of RLHF; to identify key social and
ethical issues of RLHF; and to discuss social impacts for stakeholders.
Although text-based applications of RLHF have received much attention, it is
crucial to consider when evaluating its social implications the diverse range
of areas to which it may be deployed. We describe seven primary ways in which
RLHF-based technologies will affect society by positively transforming human
experiences with AI. This paper ultimately proposes that RLHF has potential to
net positively impact areas of misinformation, AI value-alignment, bias, AI
access, cross-cultural dialogue, industry, and workforce. As RLHF raises
concerns that echo those of existing AI technologies, it will be important for
all to be aware and intentional in the adoption of RLHF.

volatility components are linear combinations of daily realized volatilities
with fixed weights, which limit its flexibility for different types of assets,
(ii.) it is still unknown what is the high-frequency probabilistic structure

(iii.) there is no high-dimensional inference tool for HAR modeling although it
is common to encounter many assets in real applications. To overcome these

the moment method describing both dense and rarefied gas behaviors with moments
of gas molecule velocity distributions. Among moment methods, the maximal
entropy moment method (MEM) stands out for its well-posedness and stability,
which utilizes velocity distributions with maximized entropy. However, finding
such distributions requires solving an ill-conditioned and
computation-demanding optimization problem. This problem causes numerical
overflow and breakdown when the numerical precision is insufficient, especially
for flows like high-speed shock waves. It also prevents modern GPUs from
accelerating optimization with their enormous single floating-point precision
computation power. This paper aims to stabilize MEM, making it practical for
simulating very strong normal shock waves on modern GPUs at single precision.
We propose the gauge transformations for MEM, making the optimization less
ill-conditioned. We also tackle numerical overflow and breakdown by adopting
the canonical form of distribution and Newton's modified optimization method.
With these techniques, we achieved a single-precision GPU simulation of a Mach
10 shock wave with 35 moments MEM, surpassing the previous double-precision
results of Mach 4. Moreover, we argued that over-refined spatial mesh degrades
both the accuracy and stability of MEM. Overall, this paper makes the maximal
entropy moment method practical for simulating very strong normal shock waves
on modern GPUs at single-precision, with significant stability improvement
compared to previous methods.

of Reeb graphs in different dimensions. A hierarchy of persistence diagrams is
then constructed by computing a persistence diagram corresponding to each Reeb

efficiently extracting knowledge from pretrained foundation models,
encompassing pretrained language models (PLMs), vision pretrained models, and
vision-language (V-L) models. However, the efficacy of employing fixed soft
prompts with a predetermined position for concatenation with inputs for all
instances, irrespective of their inherent disparities, remains uncertain.
Variables such as the position, length, and representations of prompts across
diverse instances and tasks can substantially influence the performance of
prompt tuning. In this context, we provide a theoretical analysis, which
reveals that optimizing the position of the prompt to encompass the input can
capture additional semantic information that traditional prefix or postfix
prompt tuning methods fail to capture. Building upon our analysis, we present a
unified dynamic prompt (DP) tuning strategy that dynamically determines
different factors of prompts based on specific tasks and instances. To
accomplish this, we employ a lightweight learning network with Gumble-Softmax,
allowing us to learn instance-dependent guidance. Experimental results
underscore the significant performance improvement achieved by dynamic prompt
tuning across a wide range of tasks, including NLP tasks, vision recognition
tasks, and vision-language tasks. Furthermore, we establish the universal
applicability of our approach under full-data, few-shot, and multitask
scenarios. Codes are available at https://github.com/Xianjun-Yang/DPT.

valence transition between divalent state and intermediate valence states at
Eu, which is firmly correlated to multiple degrees of freedom in the solid such
as the isostructural transition between the collapsed tetragonal (cT) and
uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) structures, $3d$ magnetism, and the formation of
P-P dimers. To gain insights into the correlated behavior, we investigate the
effect of high magnetic fields on the samples of $x = 0.4$ and $0.5$ using
magnetostriction and magnetization measurements up to 60 T. The samples are in
the Eu valence fluctuating regime, where the possible structural transition
from cT to ucT may be induced by the Eu valence change under the magnetic
fields. For both samples, magnetostriction smoothly increases with increasing
magnetic fields. The behavior is in good agreement with the calculated results
using the interconfigurational fluctuation (ICF) model that describes the
valence change. This indicates that $\Delta L$ represents the change of the Eu
valence state in these compounds. Magnetization curves for both compounds show
good agreement with the ICF model at high magnetic fields. In contrast, in the
low magnetic field region, magnetization curves do not agree with the ICF
model. These results indicate that the Eu valence changes manifest themselves
in the magnetization curves at high magnetic fields and that the magnetism of
the $3d$ electrons manifests itself in the magnetization at low magnetic
fields. Hence, we conclude that the valence change occurs within the Eu valence
fluctuation regime coupled with the cT structure. Thereby, we believe that the
transition to ucT structure which is firmly coupled with the divalent Eu state
does not occur within the magnetic field range of the present study.

Notably, these propagation steps are based on graph-dependent propagation

using random features, for incorporating early propagation steps, and for using
multiple random initializations. Then, we empirically demonstrate that RFP
significantly outperforms both spectral PE and random features in multiple node

of its robustness against the positivity, while a recent critique argues its
the un-physicalness of obtained the stationary state obtained. As an
alternative, the global approach under the Born--Markov and secular
approximations, has attracted renewed interests. However, the controversy
remains in its violation of positivity in the short-time region and/or limited
parameter region on the Bohr frequencies of the sub-systems. In this study, we
present a formalism leading to the time-convolutionless (time-local) master
equation obtained by extending the global approach beyond the Born--Markov and
secular approximations. We apply it to the excitation energy transfer between
interacting sites in which only the terminal site weakly interacts with a
bosonic environment of finite temperature in a manner beyond the rotating-wave
approximation. We find that the formulation (1) gives the short-time behavior
with preserving positivity, (2) restores the oscillative oscillatory features
obscured by the secular approximation, and (3) leads to a stationary state very
near to the Gibbs state for the total system Hamiltonian. \end{abstract}

($\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$) relation with type 1 AGN down to
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}=10^7 M_\odot$, corresponding to a $\simeq -21$
absolute magnitude in rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), at $z = 2-2.5$. Exploiting
the deep and large-area spectroscopic survey of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark
Energy Experiment (HETDEX), we identify 66 type 1 AGN with
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{10} M_\odot$ that are
measured with single-epoch virial method using C{\sc iv} emission lines
detected in the HETDEX spectra. $\mathcal{M}_*$ of the host galaxies are
estimated from optical to near-infrared photometric data taken with Spitzer,
WISE, and ground-based 4-8m class telescopes by CIGALE SED fitting. We further
assess the validity of SED fitting in two cases by host-nuclear decomposition
performed through surface brightness profile fitting on spatially-resolved host
galaxies with JWST/NIRCam CEERS data. We obtain the
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation covering the unexplored
low-mass ranges of $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}~\sim~10^7-10^8~M_\odot$, and
conduct forward modelling to fully account for the selection biases and
observational uncertainties. The intrinsic
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation at $z\sim 2$ has a moderate
positive offset of $0.52\pm0.14$~dex from the local relation, suggestive of
more efficient black hole growth at higher redshift even in the low-mass regime
of $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}~\sim~10^7-10^8~M_\odot$. Our
$\mathcal{M}_*-\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ relation is inconsistent with the
$\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{BH}$ suppression at the low-$\mathcal{M}_*$ regime
predicted by recent hydrodynamic simulations at a $98\%$ confidence level,
suggesting that feedback in the low-mass systems may be weaker than those
produced in hydrodynamic simulations.

for deepfake prevention: generating a ``scapegoat image'' by modifying the
style of the original input in a way that is recognizable as an avatar by the
user, but impossible to reconstruct the real face. Even in the case of
malicious deepfake, the privacy of the users is still protected. To achieve
this, we introduce an optimization-based editing method that utilizes GAN

combines these two tasks into a single step. We create a transformation between
two N-dimensional objects by casting this as a scattered data interpolation
problem in N + 1 dimensions. For the case of 2D shapes, we place all of our
data constraints within two planes, one for each shape. These planes are placed
parallel to one another in 3D. Zero-valued constraints specify the locations of
shape boundaries and positive-valued constraints are placed along the normal
direction in towards the center of the shape. We then invoke a variational
interpolation technique (the 3D generalization of thin-plate interpolation),
and this yields a single implicit function in 3D. Intermediate shapes are
simply the zero-valued contours of 2D slices through this 3D function. Shape
transformation between 3D shapes can be performed similarly by solving a 4D
interpolation problem. To our knowledge, ours is the first shape transformation
method to unify the tasks of implicit function creation and interpolation. The
transformations produced by this method appear smooth and natural, even between
objects of differing topologies. If desired, one or more additional shapes may
be introduced that influence the intermediate shapes in a sequence. Our method
can also reconstruct surfaces from multiple slices that are not restricted to
being parallel to one another.

Here, in a series of works on Planetary Orbit Eccentricity Trends (dubbed
POET), we study the distribution of planetary eccentricities and their
dependence on stellar/planetary properties. In this paper, the first work of
the POET series, we investigate whether and how the eccentricities of small
planets depend on stellar metallicities (e.g., [Fe/H]). Previous studies on
giant planets have found a significant correlation between planetary
eccentricities and their host metallicities. Nevertheless, whether such a
correlation exists in small planets (e.g. super-Earth and sub-Neptune) remains
unclear. Here, benefiting from the large and homogeneous LAMOST-Gaia-Kepler
sample, we characterize the eccentricity distributions of 244 (286) small
planets in single (multiple) transiting systems with the transit duration ratio
method. We confirm the eccentricity-metallicity trend that eccentricities of
single small planets increase with stellar metallicities. Interestingly, a
similar trend between eccentricity and metallicity is also found in the radial
velocity (RV) sample. We also found that the mutual inclination of multiple
transiting systems increases with metallicity, which predicts a moderate
eccentricity-metallicity rising trend. Our results of the correlation between
eccentricity (inclination) and metallicity for small planet support the core
accretion model for planet formation, and they could be footprints of self

diseases. Segmentation of dilated pancreatic ducts on computed tomography (CT)
images shows the potential to assist the early diagnosis, surgical planning and
prognosis. Because of the ducts' tiny sizes, slender tubular structures and the
surrounding distractions, most current researches on pancreatic duct
segmentation achieve low accuracy and always have segmentation errors on the
terminal parts of the ducts. To address these problems, we propose a terminal
guidance mechanism called cascaded terminal guidance network (CTG-Net).
Firstly, a terminal attention mechanism is established on the skeletons
extracted from the coarse predictions. Then, to get fine terminal segmentation,
a subnetwork is designed for jointly learning the local intensity from the
original images, feature cues from coarse predictions and global anatomy
information from the pancreas distance transform maps. Finally, a terminal
distraction attention module which explicitly learns the distribution of the
terminal distraction is proposed to reduce the false positive and false
negative predictions. We also propose a new metric called tDice to measure the
terminal segmentation accuracy for targets with tubular structures and two
segmentation metrics for distractions. We collect our dilated pancreatic duct
segmentation dataset with 150 CT scans from patients with 5 types of pancreatic
tumors. Experimental results on our dataset show that our proposed approach
boosts dilated pancreatic duct segmentation accuracy by nearly 20% compared
with the existing results, and achieves more than 9% improvement for the

non-leptonic $\mathcal B_i(\frac{1}{2}^+)\to\mathcal B_f(\frac{3}{2}^+)M$.
Previously we studied the transition $\Sigma_{b} \to \Sigma_{c}^*$ with the
quark-diquark picture of baryon in the light-front quark model. Here we revisit
this transition with three-quark picture of baryon. At the quark level, the
transition $\Sigma_{b} \to \Sigma_{c}^*$ is induced by the $b\rightarrow c$
transition.The subsystem of the two unchanged light quarks which possesses
definite and same spin in initial and final state can be viewed as a spectator,
so the spectator approximation can be applied directly. For the weak decay of
doubly charmed baryon $\Xi_{cc}$, a $c$ quark decays to a light quark $q_1$, so
both the initial state $cc$ and final state $q_1q_2$ ($q_1$ and the original
$q_2$ in initial state may be the same flavor quarks) which possess definite
spin are no longer spectators. A rearrangement of quarks for initial and final
states is adopted to isolate the unchanged subsystem $cq_2$ which can be viewed
as the spectator approximately. Future measurements on these channels will
constrain the nonperturbative parameter in the wavefunctions and test the model
predictions.

  Detection Framework for Ubiquitous IoT",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection for the Internet of Things (IoT) is a major intelligent
service required by many fields, including intrusion detection, device-activity
analysis, and security supervision. However, the heterogeneous distribution of
data and resource-constrained end nodes present challenges for existing anomaly
detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and
multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical
heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing,
computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems.
In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated
learning (AFL) framework to enable decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train
a global anomaly detection model. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, a HAPS
operates as a central aerial server, and the local models trained in UAVs are
uploaded to the HAPS for global aggregation due to its wide coverage and strong
storage and computation capabilities. We introduce a UAV selection strategy
into the AFL framework to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large
energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and detection
accuracy of the global model. To ensure the security of transmissions between
UAVs and the HAPS, we add designed noise to local model parameters in UAVs to
achieve differential privacy. Moreover, we propose a compound-action
actor-critic (CA2C)-based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV
trajectory planning algorithm to further enhance the overall federated
execution efficiency and detection model accuracy. Extensive experimental
evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can
achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low
energy consumption.

angle-constrained formation control approach under a Leader-First Follower

Both shape stabilization and maneuver control are achieved under arbitrary
initial configurations of the formation. During the formation process, the
control input of each agent is based on relative positions from its neighbors
measured in the local reference frame and wireless communications among agents
are not required. We show that the proposed distributed formation controller
ensures global exponential stability of the desired formation for an nagent

whole formation is solely determined by partial specific angles within the
target formation. The effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms is
illustrated by carrying out experiments both in simulation environments and on

aid of IRSs. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of the Rxs by jointly
optimizing the transmit covariance matrices at the Txs, the phase shifts at the
IRSs, and the resource allocation subject to the individual energy harvesting
(EH) constraints at the Rxs. Towards this goal and based on the well-known
power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) receiver structures, we consider
three practical transmission schemes, namely the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS scheme,
the IRS-aided time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme, and the IRS-aided
TDMA-D scheme. The latter two schemes differ in whether the Txs employ
deterministic energy signals known to all the Rxs. Despite the non-convexity of
the three optimization problems corresponding to the three transmission
schemes, we develop computationally efficient algorithms to address them
suboptimally, respectively, by capitalizing on the techniques of alternating
optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Moreover, we
conceive feasibility checking methods for these problems, based on which the
initial points for the proposed algorithms are constructed. Simulation results
demonstrate that our proposed IRS-aided schemes significantly outperform their
counterparts without IRSs in terms of sum rate and maximum EH requirements that
can be satisfied under various setups. In addition, the IRS-aided hybrid TS-PS

displacement sensitivity requirements, the stability control of optical path
length (OPL) is extremely important beyond the traditional requirement of
diffraction-limited imaging quality. In a telescope system, the recurring
tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling noise arises from the OPL variation due to the
wavefront deformation and angular misalignment. The pupil aberrations are
preferred option to understand the OPL specifications and further suppress TTL
coupling noise. To correct the pupil aberrations, we derive primary pupil
aberrations in a series expansion form, and then refine the formulation of
merit function by combining the pupil aberration theory and traditional image
aberration theory. The automatic correction of pupil aberrations is carried out
by using the macro programming in the commercial optical software Zemax,
leading to a high performance telescope design. The design results show that on
one side the pupil aberrations have been corrected, and on the other side, its
optical performance meets the requirements for TianQin project. The RMS
wavefront error over the science field of view (FOV) is less than {\lambda}/200

shift of frequency and conservation of momentum, which offer a new degree of
freedom for steering extreme waves and controlling phases of matter. The
concept was originally proposed for manipulating optical waves more than five
decades ago. However, due to the extreme challenges in the ultrafast
engineering of the optical materials, the experimental realization of the time
boundary effects remains elusive. Here, we introduce a time boundary into a
momentum lattice of ultracold atoms and simultaneously demonstrate the time
reflection and refraction experimentally. Through launching a
Gaussian-superposed state into the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) atomic chain, we
observe the time-reflected and refracted waves when the input state strikes a

reflection/refraction to localization with increasing strength of disorder and
show that the time boundary effects are robust against considerable disorder.

framework, Non-Parametric Outlier Synthesis (NPOS), which generates artificial
OOD training data and facilitates learning a reliable decision boundary between
ID and OOD data. Importantly, our proposed synthesis approach does not make any
distributional assumption on the ID embeddings, thereby offering strong
flexibility and generality. We show that our synthesis approach can be

experiments show that NPOS can achieve superior OOD detection performance,
outperforming the competitive rivals by a significant margin. Code is publicly

important roles to assist the early diagnosis, surgery planning and prognosis
for patients with pancreatic tumors. However, most current techniques cannot
achieve satisfactory segmentation performance for peripancreatic veins and
usually make predictions with poor integrity and connectivity. Besides,
unsupervised labeling algorithms cannot deal with complex anatomical variation
while fully supervised methods require a large number of voxel-wise annotations
for training, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address
these problems, we propose our Automated Peripancreatic vEssel Segmentation and
lAbeling (APESA) framework, to not only highly improve the segmentation
performance for peripancreatic veins, but also efficiently identify the
peripancreatic artery branches. There are two core modules in our proposed
APESA framework: iterative trunk growth module (ITGM) for vein segmentation and
weakly supervised labeling mechanism (WSLM) for artery branch identification.
Our proposed ITGM is composed of a series of trunk growth modules, each of
which chooses the most reliable trunk of a basic vessel prediction by the
largest connected constraint, and seeks for the possible growth branches by
branch proposal network. Our designed iterative process guides the raw trunk to
be more complete and fully connected. Our proposed WSLM consists of an
unsupervised rule-based preprocessing for generating pseudo branch annotations,
and an anatomical labeling network to learn the branch distribution voxel by
voxel. We achieve Dice of 94.01% for vein segmentation on our collected
dataset, which boosts the accuracy by nearly 10% compared with the
state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we also achieve Dice of 97.01% on
segmentation and competitive performance on anatomical labeling for
peripancreatic arteries.

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Depth estimation from a single image is of paramount importance in the realm
of computer vision, with a multitude of applications. Conventional methods
suffer from the trade-off between consistency and fine-grained details due to
the local-receptive field limiting their practicality. This lack of long-range
dependency inherently comes from the convolutional neural network part of the
architecture. In this paper, a dual window transformer-based network, namely
DwinFormer, is proposed, which utilizes both local and global features for
end-to-end monocular depth estimation. The DwinFormer consists of dual window
self-attention and cross-attention transformers, Dwin-SAT and Dwin-CAT,
respectively. The Dwin-SAT seamlessly extracts intricate, locally aware
features while concurrently capturing global context. It harnesses the power of
local and global window attention to adeptly capture both short-range and
long-range dependencies, obviating the need for complex and computationally
expensive operations, such as attention masking or window shifting. Moreover,
Dwin-SAT introduces inductive biases which provide desirable properties, such
as translational equvariance and less dependence on large-scale data.
Furthermore, conventional decoding methods often rely on skip connections which
may result in semantic discrepancies and a lack of global context when fusing
encoder and decoder features. In contrast, the Dwin-CAT employs both local and
global window cross-attention to seamlessly fuse encoder and decoder features
with both fine-grained local and contextually aware global information,
effectively amending semantic gap. Empirical evidence obtained through
extensive experimentation on the NYU-Depth-V2 and KITTI datasets demonstrates
the superiority of the proposed method, consistently outperforming existing
approaches across both indoor and outdoor environments.

overconfident for their incorrect predictions. Recently, many calibration

calibrated confidence, a primary and practical purpose is to detect
misclassification errors by filtering out low-confidence predictions (known as
failure prediction). In this paper, we find a general, widely-existed but
actually-neglected phenomenon that most confidence calibration methods are
useless or harmful for failure prediction. We investigate this problem and
reveal that popular confidence calibration methods often lead to worse
confidence separation between correct and incorrect samples, making it more
difficult to decide whether to trust a prediction or not. Finally, inspired by
the natural connection between flat minima and confidence separation, we
propose a simple hypothesis: flat minima is beneficial for failure prediction.
We verify this hypothesis via extensive experiments and further boost the
performance by combining two different flat minima techniques. Our code is

``emergent competition'' between species within a trophic level due to
feedbacks mediated by other trophic levels. This emergent competition gives
rise to a crossover from a regime of top-down control (populations are limited
by predators) to a regime of bottom-up control (populations are limited by
primary producers) and is captured by a simple order parameter related to the

stationarity and Markov properties. Global structures are captured using a CNN
with receptive fields covering the entire (but small) low-pass image. We test
this model on a dataset of face images, which are highly non-stationary and
contain large-scale geometric structures. Remarkably, denoising,

transport-dominated problems. The non-linearity usually needs to be addressed
by hyper-reduction techniques, such as DEIM, but it is intrusive and relies on
the assumption of affine dependence of parameters. This paper proposes and
studies a non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approach for time-dependent
parametrized problems. It is purely data-driven and naturally split into
offline and online stages. During the offline stage, a convolutional
autoencoder, consisting of an encoder and a decoder, is trained to perform
dimensionality reduction. The encoder compresses the full-order solution
snapshots to a nonlinear manifold or a low-dimensional reduced/latent space.
The decoder allows the recovery of the full-order solution from the latent
space. To deal with the time-dependent problems, a high-order dynamic mode
decomposition (HODMD) is utilized to model the trajectories in the latent space
for each parameter. During the online stage, the HODMD models are first
utilized to obtain the latent variables at a new time, then interpolation
techniques are adopted to recover the latent variables at a new parameter
value, and the full-order solution is recovered by the decoder. Some numerical
tests are conducted to show that the approach can be used to predict the unseen
full-order solution at new times and parameter values fast and accurately,
including transport-dominated problems.

benefits from transmission network expansion. However, the construction of new
power lines requires long planning phases and is often delayed by citizen
protests. As a non-invasive alternative, Dynamic Line Rating (DLR) offers the
potential to leverage the existing grid by dynamically adjusting the
transmission line capacities to the prevailing weather conditions. In this
study, we present the first investment model that includes DLR in a large-scale
power system with real-world network data and a high temporal resolution. Using
Germany as an example, we show that a system-wide integration of DLR improves
the integration of existing and additional renewables while reducing grid
congestion. The evolving synergies between DLR and increased wind generation
result in total cost savings of about 3% of all system costs for a scenario
with 80% renewable power production, mainly due to reduced storage and solar
capacity needs. If considering a fully decarbonized electricity system, the
cost savings from DLR amount to up to 5.5% of the system costs, i.e. 4 billion
Euro per year. Our results underscore the importance of a rapid implementation
of DLR in power systems to support the energy transition and relieve grid

requires no communication among the agents. Apart from simulated scenarios, the

disconnected system scales, namely, building occupants and smart-city energy
networks. This paper intends on bridging these disjointed scales to secure both
resilient and more energy-efficient urban planning thanks to a holistic
approach. The intent is to assess the aggregated impact of user behavior
stochasticities on optimal urban energy planning. To this end, a stochastic
energy community sizing and operation problem is designed, encompassing
multi-level utilities founded on energy hub concepts for improved energy and
carbon emission efficiencies. To secure the scalability of our approach, an
organic spatial problem distribution suitable for field deployment is put
forth, validated by a proof of concept. Uncertainty factors affecting urban
energy planning are particularly examined through a local sensitivity analysis,
namely, economic, climate, and occupant-behavior uncertainties. Founded on
historical measurements a typical Dutch energy community composed of 41
residential buildings is designed. Results disclose a fast-converging
distributed stochastic problem, where boilers are showcased as the preferred
heating utility, and distributed renewable energy and storage systems were
identified as unprofitable for the community. Occupant behavior was
particularly exposed as the leading uncertainty factor impacting energy
community planning. This demonstrates the relevance and value of our approach
in connecting occupants to cities for improved, and more resilient, urban
energy planning strategies.

exclusive $\Upsilon$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) of
lead ions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We work in the framework of
collinear factorization at next-to-leading order (NLO) in perturbative QCD,
modeling the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) through the Shuvaev
transform of nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). While the effects
due to the GPD modeling turn out to be small, the direct NLO predictions still
carry significant nPDF-originating uncertainties and depend strongly on the
choices of the factorization and renormalization scales. To tame the scale
dependence and to account for the fact that the NLO calculations generally
underpredict the photoproduction measurements on protons, we also present
alternative, data-driven predictions. In this approach the underlying
photoproduction cross sections on lead are found by combining their nuclear
modifications calculated at NLO with the measured photoproduction cross
sections on protons. The data-driven strategy reduces the uncertainties
associated with the scale choices, and essentially eliminates the effects of
GPD modeling thereby leaving the cross sections sensitive mainly to the input
nPDFs. Our estimates indicate that the process is measurable in ${\rm Pb}+{\rm

collision of high density plasma jets is one of the most distinguished feature
when compared with other schemes. However, the application of traditional
hydrodynamic simulation methods become limited. To overcome such limitations,
we propose a new simulation method for large-scale high density plasmas. This
method takes advantages of modern particle-in-cell simulation techniques and
binary Monte Carlo collisions, including both long-range collective
electromagnetic fields and short-range particle-particle interactions.
Especially, in this method, the restrictions of simulation grid size and time
step, which usually appear in a fully kinetic description, are eliminated. In
addition, collisional coupling and state-dependent coefficients are also
removed in this method. The correctness and robustness of the new simulation
method are verified, by comparing with fully kinetic simulations at small
scales and purely hydrodynamic simulations at large scale. Following the
conceptual design of the DCI scheme, the colliding process of two plasma jets
with initial density of 100 g/cc, initial thermal temperature of 70 eV, and
counter-propagating velocity at 300 km/s is investigated using this new method.
Quantitative values, including density increment, increased plasma temperature,
confinement time at stagnation and conversion efficiency from the colliding
kinetic energy to thermal energy, are obtained. These values agree with the
recent experimental measurements at a reasonable range.

that our scheme achieves lower FID scores, compared to prior-art EBM methods

Database, we searched for dwarf galaxy satellites of dwarf galaxies, i.e.

substructures-of-substructure. Going through HST data of 117 dwarf galaxies, we
report the discovery of a dwarf galaxy around the ultra-diffuse M96 companion
M96-DF6 at 10 Mpc. Modelling its structural parameters, we find that it is an
ultra-faint dwarf galaxy which is 135 times fainter than its host. Based on its
close projection to M96-DF6 it is unlikely that their association occurs by
chance. We compare the luminosity ratio of this and three other known
satellite-of-satellite systems with results from two different cosmological
sets of CDM simulations. For the observed stellar mass range of the central
dwarf galaxies, the simulated dwarfs have a higher luminosity ratio between the
central dwarf and its first satellite ($\approx$10'000) than observed
($\approx$100), excluding the LMC system. No simulated dwarf analog at these
observed stellar masses has the observed luminosity ratio. This cannot be due
to missing resolution, because it is the brightest subhalos that are missing.
This may indicate that there is a satellite-of-satellite (SoS) problem for CDM
in the stellar mass range between 10$^6$ and 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ - the regime of
the classical dwarf galaxies. However, simulated dwarf models at both a lower
($<10^6$ M$_\odot$) and higher ($>10^8$ M$_\odot$) stellar mass have comparable
luminosity ratios. For the higher stellar mass systems, the LMC system is
reproduced by simulations, for the lower stellar masses, no observed SoS system
has been observed to date. More observations and simulations of SoS systems are
needed to assess whether the luminosity ratio is at odds with CDM.

interest. Prior arts approach to zero-shot captioning by either utilizing the
existing large language models (e.g., GPT-2) or pre-training the
encoder-decoder network in an end-to-end manner. In this work, we propose a
simple framework, named DeCap, for zero-shot captioning. We introduce a
lightweight visual-aware language decoder. This decoder is both data-efficient
and computation-efficient: 1) it only requires the text data for training,
easing the burden on the collection of paired data. 2) it does not require
end-to-end training. When trained with text-only data, the decoder takes the
text embedding extracted from the off-the-shelf CLIP encoder as a prefix
embedding. The challenge is that the decoder is trained on the text corpus but
at the inference stage, it needs to generate captions based on visual inputs.
The modality gap issue is widely observed in multi-modal contrastive models
that prevents us from directly taking the visual embedding as the prefix
embedding. We propose a training-free mechanism to reduce the modality gap. We
project the visual embedding into the CLIP text embedding space, while the
projected embedding retains the information of the visual input. Taking the
projected embedding as the prefix embedding, the decoder generates high-quality
descriptions that match the visual input. The experiments show that DeCap
outperforms other zero-shot captioning methods and unpaired captioning methods
on the typical image captioning benchmarks, i.e., MSCOCO and NoCaps.

on Reeb graphs or contour trees has been studied and applied successfully to
various problems in topological shape matching, data analysis and
visualization. However, generalizing such results for computing distance
measures between two multi-fields based on their Reeb spaces is still in its
infancy. Towards this, in the current paper we propose a technique to compute
an effective distance measure between two multi-fields by computing a novel
multi-dimensional persistence diagram (MDPD) corresponding to each of the
(quantized) Reeb spaces. First, we construct a multi-dimensional Reeb graph
(MDRG), which is a hierarchical decomposition of the Reeb space into a
collection of Reeb graphs. The MDPD corresponding to each MDRG is then computed
based on the persistence diagrams of the component Reeb graphs of the MDRG. Our
distance measure extends the Wasserstein distance between two persistence
diagrams of Reeb graphs to MDPDs of MDRGs. We prove that the proposed measure
is a pseudo-metric and satisfies a stability property. Preliminary
implementation results of the proposed measure have been reported by computing
the distance matrix from the shape retrieval contest data - SHREC 2010 and
SHREC 2018. Experimental results and evaluation measures show that the proposed
distance measure based on the Reeb spaces has more discriminating power in

found to be the brightest epoch ever seen in this source. We observed most of
the $\gamma$-ray flare peaks to be asymmetric in profile suggesting a slow
cooling time of particles or the varying Doppler factor as the main cause of
these flares. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is fitted with PL and LP spectral
models, and in both cases, the spectral index is very steep. The $\gamma$-ray
spectrum does not extend beyond 10 GeV energy suggesting the emission is
produced within the BLR. The absence of time lags between optical-IR and
$\gamma$-ray suggest one zone emission model. Using the above information, we
have modeled the broadband SED with a simple one-zone emission model using the
publicly available code `GAMERA'. The particle distribution index is found to
be the same as expected in diffusive shock acceleration suggesting it as the
main mechanism of particle acceleration to very high energy up to 4 - 6 GeV.
Throughout the various flux phases, we noticed that the optical emission is
dominated by the thermal disk, suggesting it to be a good source to examine the
disk-jet coupling. We postulate that the observed broadband flares could be
linked with perturbation produced in the disk, which propagates to the jet and
interacts with the standing shock. However, a more detailed examination is
required.

strong impact on the amplitude and morphology of stellar light curves. In order

characteristics of the laboratory impacts and on-field HAE (n=5694) such as the

can be divided into shear-sensitive and -insensitive events. The external shear
strain lowers the energy barriers of shear-sensitive events. Thermal assistance

is of direct relevance to climate studies. Measurements of total solar
irradiance exist since 1978, but this is too short compared to climate-relevant
time scales. Coming from a number of different instruments, these measurements
require a cross-calibration, which is not straightforward, and thus several
composite records have been created. All of them suggest a marginally
decreasing trend since 1996. Most composites also feature a weak decrease over
the entire period of observations, which is also seen in observations of the
solar surface magnetic field and is further supported by Ca II K data. Some
inconsistencies, however, remain and overall the magnitude and even the
presence of the long-term trend remain uncertain. Different models have been
developed, which are used to understand the irradiance variability over the
satellite period and to extend the records of solar irradiance back in time.
Differing in their methodologies, all models require proxies of solar magnetic
activity as input. The most widely used proxies are sunspot records and
cosmogenic isotope data on centennial and millennial time scale, respectively.
None of this, however, offers a sufficiently good, independent description of
the long-term evolution of faculae and network responsible for solar
brightening. This leads to uncertainty in the amplitude of the long-term
changes in solar irradiance. Here we review recent efforts to improve
irradiance reconstructions on time scales longer than the solar cycle and to
reduce the existing uncertainty in the magnitude of the long-term variability.
In particular, we highlight the potential of using 3D magnetohydrodynamical
simulations of the solar atmosphere as input to more physical irradiance models

efficiency. However, monitoring large and complex structures such as sweet
pepper plants presents significant challenges, especially due to frequent
occlusions of the fruits. Traditional next-best view planning can lead to
unstructured and inefficient coverage of the crops. To address this, we propose
a novel view motion planner that builds a graph network of viable view poses
and trajectories between nearby poses, thereby considering robot motion
constraints. The planner searches the graphs for view sequences with the
highest accumulated information gain, allowing for efficient pepper plant
monitoring while minimizing occlusions. The generated view poses aim at both
sufficiently covering already detected and discovering new fruits. The graph
and the corresponding best view pose sequence are computed with a limited
horizon and are adaptively updated in fixed time intervals as the system
gathers new information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through simulated and real-world experiments using a robotic arm equipped with
an RGB-D camera and mounted on a trolley. As the experimental results show, our
planner produces view pose sequences to systematically cover the crops and
leads to increased fruit coverage when given a limited time in comparison to a
state-of-the-art single next-best view planner.

However, fine-tuning these models can lead to a trade-off between
in-distribution (ID) performance and out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness.
Existing methods for tackling this trade-off do not explicitly address the OOD
robustness problem. In this paper, based on causal analysis of the
aforementioned problems, we propose a novel fine-tuning method, which uses
masked images as counterfactual samples that help improve the robustness of the

semantics-unrelated patches of the images based on class activation map to
break the spurious correlation, and refill the masked patches with patches from
other images. The resulting counterfactual samples are used in feature-based
distillation with the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments verify that
regularizing the fine-tuning with the proposed masked images can achieve a
better trade-off between ID and OOD performance, surpassing previous methods on

to explain the diffusion and desorption of molecules which require more energy
than the thermal energy available in quiescent molecular clouds (10 K). This
energy distribution can be important in phosphorous hydrides, elusive yet
fundamental molecules for interstellar prebiotic chemistry. We studied the
reaction dynamics of the \ce{P + H -> PH} reaction on amorphous solid water, a
reaction of astrophysical interest, using \emph{ab-initio} molecular dynamics
with atomic forces evaluated by a neural network interatomic potential. We
found that the exact nature of the initial phosphorous binding sites is less
relevant for the energy dissipation process because the nascent PH molecule
rapidly migrates to sites with higher binding energy after the reaction.
Non-thermal diffusion and desorption-after-reaction were observed and occurred
early in the dynamics, essentially decoupled from the dissipation of the
chemical reaction energy. From an extensive sampling of reactions on sites, we
constrained the average dissipated reaction energy within the simulation time
(50 ps) to be between 50 and 70 %. Most importantly, the fraction of
translational energy acquired by the formed molecule was found to be mostly
between 1 and 5 %. Including these values, specifically for the test cases of
2% and 5% of translational energy conversion, in astrochemical models, reveals
very low gas-phase abundances of PH$_{x}$ molecules and reflects that
considering binding energy distributions is paramount for correctly merging
microscopic and macroscopic modelling of non-thermal surface astrochemical
processes. Finally, we found that PD molecules dissipate more of the reaction
energy. This effect can be relevant for the deuterium fractionation and
preferential distillation of molecules in the interstellar medium.

show that $\rho\approx1/3$ fm and $R\approx1$ fm, and the corresponding packing
parameter $\kappa=\rho^{4}/R^{4}\approx0.01$. The strength of the light
quark-instanton interaction is sizable and close to that of the gluon-instanton
one since the dynamical light quark mass $M_{q}$ and dynamical gluon mass
$M_{g}$ are given by $M_{q}\approx M_{g}\approx 360$
MeV$\sim\kappa^{1/2}\rho^{-1}$. On the other hand, the strength of the heavy

The instantons are responsible for mutual interactions among colored particles
which are crossing the field of the same instanton, like t'Hooft-like
interactions of $N_{f}$ light quarks ($N_{f}$ is the light quark flavors
number). The light quark propagators in the instanton field have zero modes,

perfectly describe the light quark physics and its most important and basic
phenomena - the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry (SBChS) in details.
These one allows us to find the properties of light and heavy quarks
interactions and get SBChS traces in light-heavy and heavy-heavy quarks

unprecedented TE performance in metals by tuning the energy-dependent

(focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming). Here, we present a fully
analytical, theoretical model describing the fluid flow and transport of
tracers induced by the laser at all length scales in two-dimensional
confinement. The focused light causes a small, local temperature change, which
in turn results in a small change in the density and viscosity of the fluid
locally. We analytically solve for the instantaneous flow field due to the
translation of a heat spot of arbitrary time-dependent amplitude along a scan
path. We show that the leading-order instantaneous flow results purely from
thermal expansion. It is proportional to the magnitude of the temperature
perturbation, with far-field behaviour typically dominated by a source or sink
flow and proportional to the rate of change of the heat-spot amplitude. In
contrast, and in agreement with experimental measurements, the net displacement
of a tracer due to a full scan of the heat spot is quadratic in the heat-spot
amplitude, as it results from the interplay of thermal expansion and thermal
viscosity changes. The corresponding average velocity of tracers over a scan is
a hydrodynamic source dipole in the far field, with direction dependent on the
relative importance of thermal expansion and thermal viscosity changes. Our
quantitative findings show excellent agreement with recent experimental results
and will enable the design of new controlled experiments to establish the

the Majorana nature of the material's magnetic excitations. It has been argued,
however, that the thermal Hall signal in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rather stems from
phonons or topological magnons than from Majorana fermions. Here we investigate
the thermal Hall effect of the closely related Kitaev quantum material
Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, and we show that the thermal Hall signal emerges from at
least two components, phonons and magnetic excitations. This dichotomy results
from our discovery that the transversal heat conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$ carries
clear signatures of the phononic $\kappa_{xx}$, but changes sign upon entering
the low-temperature, magnetically ordered phase. We systematically resolve the
two components by considering the detailed temperature and field dependence of
both $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\kappa_{xx}$. Our results demonstrate that uncovering a
genuinely quantized magnetic thermal Hall effect in a Kitaev topological
quantum spin liquid requires to disentangle phonon vs. magnetic contributions
where the latter include potentially fractionalized excitations such as the

instrument for solving complex problems and even surpassed human performance in
several challenging applications. This signifies that RL algorithms can be used
in the autonomous air combat problem, which has been studied for many years.
The complexity of air combat arises from aggressive close-range maneuvers and
agile enemy behaviors. In addition to these complexities, there may be
uncertainties in real-life scenarios due to sensor errors, which prevent
estimation of the actual position of the enemy. In this case, autonomous
aircraft should be successful even in the noisy environments. In this study, we
developed an air combat simulation, which provides noisy observations to the
agents, therefore, make the air combat problem even more challenging. Thus, we
present a state stacking method for noisy RL environments as a noise reduction
technique. In our extensive set of experiments, the proposed method
significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in terms of the winning
ratio, where the performance improvement is even more pronounced in the high
noise levels. In addition, we incorporate a self-play scheme to our training
process by periodically updating the enemy with a frozen copy of the training
agent. By this way, the training agent performs air combat simulations to an
enemy with smarter strategies, which improves the performance and robustness of
the agents. In our simulations, we demonstrate that the self-play scheme
provides important performance gains compared to the classical RL training.

coefficients related to charge and heat in thermal QCD. For this purpose, the
electrical ($\sigma_{\rm el}$), Hall ($\sigma_{\rm H}$), thermal ($\kappa$) and
Hall-type thermal ($\kappa_{\rm H}$) conductivities are determined using the
kinetic theory approach in association with the non-extensive Tsallis
statistical mechanism. The effect of non-extensivity is encoded in the
non-extensive Tsallis distribution function, where the deviation of the
parameter $q$ from 1 signifies the degree of non-extensivity in the concerned
system. The thermal and electrical conductivities are found to increase with
the introduction of non-extensivity, which means that the deviation of the
medium from thermal equilibrium enhances both charge and heat transports. With
the magnetic field, the deviations of $\sigma_{\rm el}$, $\sigma_{\rm H}$,
$\kappa$ and $\kappa_{\rm H}$ from their respective equilibrated values
increase, whereas these deviations decrease with the chemical potential. We
have also studied how the extent of the non-extensivity modulates the longevity
of magnetic field and observed that the time of existence of a stable magnetic
field increases as $q$ rises above unity. Thus, as compared to a thermally
equilibrated medium, the lifetime of the magnetic field is longer in a medium
which is about to reach equilibrium. Present work is further extended to the
study of some observables associated with the aforesaid transport phenomena,
such as the Knudsen number and the elliptic flow within the non-extensive

manifest with the formation of transient photospheric penumbral-like filaments.
Although the magnetic field changes rapidly during the evolution of such

events yet. We analyzed observations of a pore in NOAA AR 12739 from the
Swedish Solar Telescope including spectropolarimetric data of the Fe I 6173
{\AA} and the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line and spectroscopic data of the Ca II K 3934

photosphere and the chromosphere. Multiple filamentary structures of inclined
magnetic fields are found in photospheric inclination maps at the boundary of
the pore, although the pore never developed a penumbra. One of the filaments
shows a clear counterpart in continuum intensity maps in addition to
photospheric blueshifts. During its decay, a brightening in the blue wing of
the Ca II 8542 {\AA} line is observed. The Ca II K 3934 {\AA} and the Ca II

STiC inversion results using data from all available lines yield a temperature
increase (roughly 1000 Kelvin) and bidirectional flows (magnitudes up to 8
km/s) at log tau=-3.5. The temporal and spatial correlation of the decaying
filament (observed in the photosphere) to the temperature increase and the
bidirectional flows in the high photosphere/low chromosphere suggests that they
are connected. We propose scenarios in which magnetic reconnection happens at
the edge of a rising magnetic flux tube in the photosphere. This leads to both
the decay of the filament in the photosphere and the observed temperature
increase and the bidirectional flows in the high photosphere/low chromosphere.

We study redistribution mechanisms for diffusion auctions, which is a new trend

existing participants are incentivized to invite new participants to join the
auctions. Hence, when we design redistributions, we also need to maintain this

targeted at modifying the payment design of a truthful mechanism, such as the

with high Curie temperature (TC) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) is
highly desirable for the development of ultra-compact magnetic sensors and
magnetic memories. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) Cr2Te3 appears as a
promising candidate. Bulk Cr2Te3 exhibits strong PMA and a TC of 180 K.
Moreover, both PMA and TC might be adjusted in ultrathin films by engineering
composition, strain, or applying an electric field. In this work, we
demonstrate the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of vdW heterostructures of
five-monolayer quasi-freestanding Cr2Te3 on three classes of 2D materials:
graphene (semimetal), WSe2 (semiconductor) and Bi2Te3 (topological insulator).
By combining structural and chemical analysis down to the atomic level with ab
initio calculations, we confirm the single crystalline character of Cr2Te3
films on the 2D materials with sharp vdW interfaces. They all exhibit PMA and
TC close to the bulk Cr2Te3 value of 180 K. Ab initio calculations confirm this
PMA and show how its strength depends on strain. Finally, Hall measurements
reveal a strong anomalous Hall effect, which changes sign at a given
temperature. We theoretically explain this effect by a sign change of the Berry
phase close to the Fermi level. This transition temperature depends on the 2D
material in proximity, notably as a consequence of charge transfer. MBE-grown
Cr2Te3/2D material bilayers constitute model systems for the further
development of spintronic devices combining PMA, large spin-orbit coupling and
sharp vdW interface.

propose the first distributed mechanism in social networks without revealing

decentralization that does not rely on any trustworthy third party. Moreover,
the centralized reduction of our mechanism also offers a novel way to compute

simply the inverse of the trapping rate for infinitely extended trapping zones,

Having varied these parameters, we obtain 27 unique SICR-definitions and fit
logistic regression models accordingly using rich South African mortgage data;
itself containing various macroeconomic and obligor-specific input variables.
This new SICR-modelling approach is demonstrated by analysing the resulting

compare both the accuracy and flexibility of the SICR-predictions across all

$Y$ is to be predicted based on the observation of a random vector $X$, taking
its values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\geq 1$ say. The statistical learning
problem consists in building a predictive function $\hat{f}:\mathbb{R}^d\to
\mathbb{R}$ based on independent copies of the pair $(X,Y)$ so that $Y$ is
approximated by $\hat{f}(X)$ with minimum error in the mean-squared sense.
Motivated by various applications, ranging from environmental sciences to
finance or insurance, special attention is paid here to the case of extreme
(i.e. very large) observations $X$. Because of their rarity, they contribute in
a negligible manner to the (empirical) error and the predictive performance of
empirical quadratic risk minimizers can be consequently very poor in extreme
regions. In this paper, we develop a general framework for regression in the
extremes. It is assumed that $X$'s conditional distribution given $Y$ belongs
to a non parametric class of heavy-tailed probability distributions. It is then
shown that an asymptotic notion of risk can be tailored to summarize
appropriately predictive performance in extreme regions of the input space. It
is also proved that minimization of an empirical and non asymptotic version of
this 'extreme risk', based on a fraction of the largest observations solely,
yields regression functions with good generalization capacity. In addition,
numerical results providing strong empirical evidence of the relevance of the

challenge where the combination of rigorous criteria and informal intuition is

main tool are the Child-Selections: injective maps that associate species $m$
to reactions $j$ where $m$ participates as reactant. Firstly, we employ a
Cauchy-Binet analysis and we structurally express any coefficient of the
characteristic polynomial of the Jacobian in terms of Child-Selections. In
particular, we fully characterize sign-changes of any of the coefficients.
Secondly, we prove that the (in)stability of the Jacobian is inherited from the
(in)stability of simpler submatrices identified by the Child-Selections.
Thirdly, we provide sufficient conditions for purely imaginary eigenvalues of
the Jacobian, hinting at Hopf bifurcation and oscillatory behavior. All
conditions are in terms of signs of integer stoichiometric submatrices
identified by the Child-Selections. Finally, we focus on systems endowed with
Michaelis-Menten kinetics and we show that any symbolic realization of the

The motivation behind it is illustrated by how the goals of prediction and

least squares that leverages the above conditional expectation invariance

eliminate all endogenous variables and the $\ell_0$ penalized EILLS estimator

First, we demonstrate how to build a smooth silicone hemispheric sensing medium

bounded in norm independently of the gauge configuration and uniformly in the
volume. Under these assumptions, any order parameter vanishes in the symmetric
limit of fermions of equal masses. I show that these assumptions are satisfied
by staggered, minimally doubled and Ginsparg-Wilson fermions for positive
fermion mass, for any value of the lattice spacing, and so in the continuum
limit if this exists. They are instead not satisfied by Wilson fermions, for
which spontaneous vector flavor symmetry breaking is known to take place in the
Aoki phase. The existence of regularizations unaffected by residual fermion

scenes need to be viewed from different angles to achieve sufficient coverage.
The mapping of confined spaces such as shelves is an especially challenging
task since objects occlude each other and the scene can only be observed from
the front, thus with limited possible viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a
deep reinforcement learning framework that generates promising views aiming at
reducing the map entropy. Additionally, the pipeline extends standard viewpoint
planning by predicting adequate minimally invasive push actions to uncover
occluded objects and increase the visible space. Using a 2.5D occupancy height
map as state representation that can be efficiently updated, our system decides
whether to plan a new viewpoint or perform a push. To learn feasible pushes, we
use a neural network to sample push candidates on the map and have human
experts manually label them to indicate whether the sampled push is a good
action to perform. As simulated and real-world experimental results with a
robotic arm show, our system is able to significantly increase the mapped space
compared to different baselines, while the executed push actions highly benefit
the viewpoint planner with only minor changes to the object configuration.

initial exploration of digitized collections. Nowadays, the most efficient KWS
methods are relying on machine learning techniques that require a large amount
of annotated training data. However, in the case of historical manuscripts,
there is a lack of annotated corpus for training. To handle the data scarcity
issue, we investigate the merits of the self-supervised learning to extract
useful representations of the input data without relying on human annotations
and then using these representations in the downstream task. We propose
ST-KeyS, a masked auto-encoder model based on vision transformers where the
pretraining stage is based on the mask-and-predict paradigm, without the need
of labeled data. In the fine-tuning stage, the pre-trained encoder is
integrated into a siamese neural network model that is fine-tuned to improve
feature embedding from the input images. We further improve the image
representation using pyramidal histogram of characters (PHOC) embedding to
create and exploit an intermediate representation of images based on text
attributes. In an exhaustive experimental evaluation on three widely used
benchmark datasets (Botany, Alvermann Konzilsprotokolle and George Washington),
the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods trained on the same
datasets.

  Pipelines",,,,,"cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of entity resolution is to identify records in multiple datasets
that represent the same real-world entity. However, comparing all records
across datasets can be computationally intensive, leading to long runtimes. To
reduce these runtimes, entity resolution pipelines are constructed of two
parts: a blocker that applies a computationally cheap method to select
candidate record pairs, and a matcher that afterwards identifies matching pairs
from this set using more expensive methods. This paper presents SC-Block, a
blocking method that utilizes supervised contrastive learning for positioning
records in the embedding space, and nearest neighbour search for candidate set
building. We benchmark SC-Block against eight state-of-the-art blocking
methods. In order to relate the training time of SC-Block to the reduction of
the overall runtime of the entity resolution pipeline, we combine SC-Block with
four matching methods into complete pipelines. For measuring the overall
runtime, we determine candidate sets with 98% pair completeness and pass them
to the matcher. The results show that SC-Block is able to create smaller
candidate sets and pipelines with SC-Block execute 1.5 to 2 times faster
compared to pipelines with other blockers, without sacrificing F1 score.
Blockers are often evaluated using relatively small datasets which might lead
to runtime effects resulting from a large vocabulary size being overlooked. In
order to measure runtimes in a more challenging setting, we introduce a new
benchmark dataset that requires large numbers of product offers to be blocked.
On this large-scale benchmark dataset, pipelines utilizing SC-Block and the
best-performing matcher execute 8 times faster than pipelines utilizing another
blocker with the same matcher reducing the runtime from 2.5 hours to 18
minutes, clearly compensating for the 5 minutes required for training SC-Block.

  Inversion",,,"10.1111/1365-2478.13363",,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Monitoring the rock-physics properties of the subsurface is of great
importance for reservoir management. For either oil and gas applications or CO2
storage, seismic data are a valuable source of information for tracking changes
in elastic properties which can be related to fluids saturation and pressure
changes within the reservoir. Changes in elastic properties can be estimated
with time-lapse full-waveform inversion. Monitoring rock-physics properties,
such as saturation, with time-lapse full-waveform inversion is usually a
two-step process: first, elastic properties are estimated with full-waveform
inversion, then, the rock-physics properties are estimated with rock-physics
inversion. However, multiparameter time-lapse full-waveform inversion is prone
to crosstalk between parameter classes across different vintages. This leads to
leakage from one parameter class to another, which, in turn, can introduce
large errors in the estimated rock-physics parameters. To avoid inaccuracies
caused by crosstalk and the two-step inversion strategy, we reformulate
time-lapse full-waveform inversion to estimate directly the changes in the
rock-physics properties. Using Gassmann's model, we adopt a new
parameterization containing porosity, clay content, and water saturation. In
the context of reservoir monitoring, changes are assumed to be induced by fluid
substitution only. The porosity and clay content can thus be kept constant
during time-lapse inversion. We compare this parameterization with the usual
density-velocity parameterization for different benchmark models. Results
indicate that the proposed parameterization eliminates crosstalk between
parameters of different vintages, leading to more accurate estimation of
saturation changes. We also show that using the parameterization based on
porosity, clay content, and water saturation, the elastic changes can be
monitored more accurately.

performance even in unseen situations, it often performs in ways not intuitive
to humans. Particularly, they usually do not consider the pronunciation of the
input, which humans would utilize to understand language, especially when it
comes to unknown words. Thus, this paper inserts phonetic prior into
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), one of the V\&L pretrained
models, to make it consider the pronunciation similarity among its
pronunciation inputs. To achieve this, we first propose a phoneme embedding
that utilizes the phoneme relationships provided by the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA) chart as a phonetic prior. Next, by distilling the frozen CLIP
text encoder, we train a pronunciation encoder employing the IPA-based
embedding. The proposed model named IPA-CLIP comprises this pronunciation
encoder and the original CLIP encoders (image and text). Quantitative
evaluation reveals that the phoneme distribution on the embedding space
represents phonetic relationships more accurately when using the proposed
phoneme embedding. Furthermore, in some multimodal retrieval tasks, we confirm
that the proposed pronunciation encoder enhances the performance of the text
encoder and that the pronunciation encoder handles nonsense words in a more
phonetic manner than the text encoder. Finally, qualitative evaluation verifies
the correlation between the pronunciation encoder and human perception
regarding pronunciation similarity.

the mass and radius of the neutron star model for GRB 200415A, by identifying
the observed QPOs with the crustal torsional oscillations together with the
experimental constraints on the nuclear matter properties. The frequencies of
the crustal torsional oscillations are determined by solving the eigenvalue

overtones of crustal oscillations, for carefully selected combinations of the
nuclear saturation parameters. Thus, we can inversely constrain the neutron

On the other hand, decoys cloning the deployed microservices of an application

it is essential to use a limited amount of decoy resources and devise a
suitable cloning strategy to minimize the impact on legitimate services

optimization problem that maximizes the number of attack paths intercepted by
the allocated decoys within a fixed resource budget. Attack paths represent the
attacker's movements within the infrastructure as a sequence of violated

approximate the optimal solution and overcome the computational complexity of
the proposed formulation. We evaluate the performance of the optimal and

resulting in high operational costs and poor service quality. A key operational
challenge in ESMS is related to parking, particularly how to ensure a shared

instance, our recent study illustrated that up to 12.9% of shared E-bike users
in Dublin, Ireland cannot park their E-bikes properly due to a lack of planning
and user-centric guidance. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose
U-Park, a user-centric smart parking recommendation system for ESMS aiming at
making personalised recommendations to ESMS users by considering a given user's
historical mobility data, current trip trajectory and parking space
availability. We propose the system architecture, implement it, and evaluate
its performance based on a real-world dataset from an Irish-based shared E-bike

a user's destination in a shared E-bike system with around 97.33% accuracy
without direct user inputs, and such results can be subsequently used to
recommend the best parking station for the user depending on the availability

saddle point corresponding to the Bloch-point creation/destruction. By
carefully modulating the local property of a surface, such as interfacial DMI
induced by breaking the structural symmetry, the energy landscape of a magnetic

for which we adopt scaled versions of the profiles observed in low-z galaxies.
We demonstrate the technique in a sample of 21 galaxies at redshift z>6,
including six at z=7.2-10.6 recently observed with JWST. Our model estimates
the emergent Lya properties, and the foreground distance to the absorbing IGM.
We find that galaxies at z>7.5 exist in smaller bubbles (~1 pMpc) than those at
z<7. With a relationship that is secure at 3-sigma, we empirically demonstrate
the growth of ionized regions during the reionization epoch for the first time.
We independently estimate the upper limit on the Stromgren radii (Rstrom), and
derive the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the ratio of Rbub/Rstrom,
finding a median value of 17% which on average can provide the photon budget

web-tools to identify possible images that overlap with the position of NEOs,
and acquires information on the NEOs predicted position and other properties
(e.g., magnitude, rate and direction of motion) at the time of observations. We
have recovered 196 appearances of NEOs from a set of 968 appearances predicted
to be recoverable. It includes appearances for three NEOs which were on the
impact risk list at that point. These appearances were well before their
discovery. The subsequent risk assessment using the extracted astrometry
removes these NEOs from the risk list. We estimate a detectability rate of 0.05
per NEO at an SNR>3 for NEOs in the OmegaCAM archive. Our automatic recovery
rates are 40% and 20% for NEOs on the risk list and the full list,
respectively. The achieved astrometric and photometric accuracy is on average
0.12 arcsec and 0.1 mag. These results show the high potential of the archival

programming (FRP) have been suggested, which use modal types to ensure
properties like causality, productivity and lack of space leaks. So far, almost
all of these languages have included a modal operator for delay on a global
clock. For some applications, however, the notion of global clock is unnatural
and leads to leaky abstractions as well as inefficient implementations. While
modal languages without a global clock have been proposed, no operational
properties have been proved about them, yet.
  This paper proposes Async RaTT, a new modal language for asynchronous FRP,
equipped with an operational semantics mapping complete programs to machines
that take asynchronous input signals and produce output signals. The main
novelty of Async RaTT is a new modality for asynchronous delay, allowing each
output channel to be associated at runtime with the set of input channels it
depends on, thus causing the machine to only compute new output when necessary.
We prove a series of operational properties including causality, productivity

similar images in natural language. It is more challenging than general image
captioning, because it requires capturing fine-grained change information while

change descriptions. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood contrastive
transformer to improve the model's perceiving ability for various changes under
different scenes and cognition ability for complex syntax structure.
Concretely, we first design a neighboring feature aggregating to integrate
neighboring context into each feature, which helps quickly locate the
inconspicuous changes under the guidance of conspicuous referents. Then, we
devise a common feature distilling to compare two images at neighborhood level
and extract common properties from each image, so as to learn effective
contrastive information between them. Finally, we introduce the explicit

better understand complex syntax structure during training. Extensive

Recent studies show that linear wavepacket models can be employed for

test different control approaches and highlight the potential restrictions on a
successful noise control in an actual jet. The model contains all the essential
elements for a realistic representation of the actual control problem: a
stochastic wavepacket is obtained via a linear Ginzburg-Landau model; the
effect of the wing trailing edge is accounted for by introducing a
semi-infinite half plane near the wavepacket; and the actuation is achieved by
placing a dipolar point source at the trailing edge, which models a
piezoelectric actuator. An optimal causal resolvent-based control method is
compared against the classical wave-cancellation method. The effect of the
causality constraint on the control performance is tested by placing the sensor
at different positions. We demonstrate that when the sensor is not positioned
sufficiently upstream of the trailing edge, which can be the case for the
actual control problem due to geometric restrictions, causality reduces the
control performance. We also show that this limitation can be moderated using
the optimal causal control together with modelling of the forcing.

proposed decentralized modified coded caching scheme (D-MCCS) and formulate the
cache placement optimization problem to minimize the average rate for the
D-MCCS. To solve this challenging non-convex optimization problem, we first
propose a successive Geometric Programming (GP) approximation algorithm, which
guarantees convergence to a stationary point but has high computational
complexity. Next, we develop a low-complexity file-group-based approach, where
we propose a popularity-first and size-aware (PF-SA) cache placement strategy
to partition files into two groups, taking into account the nonuniformity in
file popularity and size. Both algorithms do not require the knowledge of
active users beforehand for cache placement. Numerical results show that they
perform very closely to each other. We further develop a lower bound for
decentralized caching under nonuniform file popularity and size as a non-convex
optimization problem and solved it using a similar successive GP approximation
algorithm. We show that the D-MCCS with the optimized cache placement attains
this lower bound when no more than two active users request files at a time.
The same is true for files with uniform size but nonuniform popularity and the
optimal cache placement being symmetric among files. In these cases, the
optimized DMCCS characterizes the exact memory-rate tradeoff for decentralized
caching. For general cases, our numerical results show that the average rate
achieved by the optimized D-MCCS is very close to the lower bound.

systems, it has been observed that these approaches overly exploit
easier-to-fit samples, thus inevitably learning spurious edges. Worse still,
inherent mostly in these methods the common homogeneity assumption can be
easily violated, due to the widespread existence of heterogeneous data in the
real world, resulting in performance vulnerability when noise distributions
vary. We propose a simple yet effective model-agnostic framework to boost
causal discovery performance by dynamically learning the adaptive weights for
the Reweighted Score function, ReScore for short, where the weights tailor
quantitatively to the importance degree of each sample. Intuitively, we
leverage the bilevel optimization scheme to \wx{alternately train a standard
DAG learner and reweight samples -- that is, upweight the samples the learner
fails to fit and downweight the samples that the learner easily extracts the
spurious information from. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets are carried out to validate the effectiveness of ReScore.
We observe consistent and significant boosts in structure learning performance.
Furthermore, we visualize that ReScore concurrently mitigates the influence of
spurious edges and generalizes to heterogeneous data. Finally, we perform the
theoretical analysis to guarantee the structure identifiability and the weight
adaptive properties of ReScore in linear systems. Our codes are available at

system are taking shape. The textile sector needs to actively look at such
emerging and new technologies taking inspiration from their workings and
processing methods in order to stimulate new and innovative embedded
intelligence advancements in the etextile world. This emerging next generation
of Artificial intelligence(AI) is rapidly gaining interest across varying
industries (textile, medical, automotive, aerospace, military). How such
properties can inspire and drive advancements within the etextiles sector needs
to be considered. This paper will provide an insight into current
nanotechnology and artificial intelligence advancements in the etextiles domain
before focusing specifically on the future vision and direction around the
potential application of neuromorphic computing and spiking neural network
inspired AI technologies within the textile sector. We investigate the core
architectural elements of artificial neural networks, neuromorphic computing
and how such neuroscience inspired technologies could impact and inspire change
and new research developments within the e-textile sector.

offering a promising solution to reduce patient discomfort. However, the
limited autonomy of most robotic FEs results in non-intuitive and challenging
manoeuvres, constraining their application in clinical settings. While previous
studies have employed lumen tracking for autonomous navigation, they fail to
adapt to the presence of obstructions and sharp turns when the endoscope faces
the colon wall. In this work, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL)-based navigation strategy that eliminates the need for lumen tracking.
However, the use of DRL methods poses safety risks as they do not account for
potential hazards associated with the actions taken. To ensure safety, we
exploit a Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) method to restrict the
policy in a predefined safety regime. Moreover, we present a model selection
strategy that utilises Formal Verification (FV) to choose a policy that is
entirely safe before deployment. We validate our approach in a virtual
colonoscopy environment and report that out of the 300 trained policies, we
could identify three policies that are entirely safe. Our work demonstrates
that CRL, combined with model selection through FV, can improve the robustness
and safety of robotic behaviour in surgical applications.

demonstrate that the twisted (e, 2e) process retrieves the p-type character of

platforms to model fundamental ultrafast phenomena and explore spintronics.
However, to date, they have only been fabricated epitaxially on specific
symmetry-matched crystalline substrates, to preserve their intrinsic
magneto-crystalline order. This curtails their integration with dissimilar
supports, markedly restricting the scope of fundamental and applied
investigations. Here, we circumvent this limitation by designing detachable
crystalline antiferromagnetic nanomembranes of $\alpha$-Fe$_{2}$O$_{3}$, that
can be transferred onto other desirable supports after growth. We develop
transmission-based antiferromagnetic vector-mapping to show that these
nanomembranes harbour rich topological phenomenology at room temperature.
Moreover, we exploit their extreme flexibility to demonstrate three-dimensional
reconfiguration of antiferromagnetic properties, driven locally via
flexure-induced strains. This allows us to spatially design antiferromagnetic
states outside their typical thermal stability window. Integration of such
freestanding antiferromagnetic layers with flat or curved nanostructures could
enable spin texture designs tailored by magnetoelastic-/geometric-effects in
the quasi-static and dynamical regimes, opening new explorations into
curvilinear antiferromagnetism and unconventional computing.

where different pressures selectively expose different oxidation stages within

oxidation stage is dictated by reactive bond-switching mechanisms. This work
provides atomistic details and a potential foundation for rational

analysis, an additional $4.7\times10^{20}$ POT neutrino data was collected at

the near-detector analysis introducing new selections and using more than
double the data. Additionally, this is the first T2K oscillation analysis to
use NA61/SHINE data on a replica of the T2K target to tune the neutrino flux
model, and the neutrino interaction model was improved to include new nuclear
effects and calculations. Frequentist and Bayesian analyses are presented,
including results on $\sin^2\theta_{13}$ and the impact of priors on the
$\delta_\mathrm{CP}$ measurement. Both analyses prefer the normal mass ordering
and upper octant of $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ with a nearly maximally CP-violating

$2\sigma$ credible level using a flat prior in $\delta_\mathrm{CP}$, and just
below $2\sigma$ using a flat prior in $\sin\delta_\mathrm{CP}$. When the

$\sin^2\theta_{13}=28.0^{+2.8}_{-6.5}\times10^{-3}$, in agreement with

Existing works for this task often fail to retain the source content while
achieving geometry variation. Here, we present a novel StyO model, ie. Stylize
the face in only One-shot, to solve the above problem. In particular, StyO
exploits a disentanglement and recombination strategy. It first disentangles
the content and style of source and target images into identifiers, which are
then recombined in a cross manner to derive the stylized face image. In this
way, StyO decomposes complex images into independent and specific attributes,
and simplifies one-shot face stylization as the combination of different
attributes from input images, thus producing results better matching face
geometry of target image and content of source one. StyO is implemented with
latent diffusion models (LDM) and composed of two key modules: 1) Identifier
Disentanglement Learner (IDL) for disentanglement phase. It represents
identifiers as contrastive text prompts, ie. positive and negative
descriptions. And it introduces a novel triple reconstruction loss to fine-tune
the pre-trained LDM for encoding style and content into corresponding
identifiers; 2) Fine-grained Content Controller (FCC) for the recombination
phase. It recombines disentangled identifiers from IDL to form an augmented
text prompt for generating stylized faces. In addition, FCC also constrains the
cross-attention maps of latent and text features to preserve source face
details in results. The extensive evaluation shows that StyO produces
high-quality images on numerous paintings of various styles and outperforms the
current state-of-the-art. Code will be released upon acceptance.

WASP-127b, a close-in puffy sub-Saturn orbiting its solar-type host star in 4.2
d, using HST and Spitzer revealed a feature-rich transmission spectrum with
strong excess absorption at 4.5 um. However, the limited spectral resolution
and coverage of these instruments could not distinguish between CO and/or CO2
absorption causing this signal, with both low and high C/O ratio scenarios
being possible. Here we present near-infrared (0.9--2.5 um) transit
observations of WASP-127 b using the high-resolution SPIRou spectrograph, with
the goal to disentangle CO from CO2 through the 2.3 um CO band. With SPIRou, we
detect H2O at a t-test significance of 5.3 sigma and observe a tentative (3
sigma) signal consistent with OH absorption. From a joint SPIRou + HST +
Spitzer retrieval analysis, we rule out a CO-rich scenario by placing an upper
limit on the CO abundance of log10[CO]<-4.0, and estimate a log10[CO2] of
-3.7^(+0.8)_(-0.6), which is the level needed to match the excess absorption
seen at 4.5um. We also set abundance constraints on other major C-, O-, and
N-bearing molecules, with our results favoring low C/O (0.10^(+0.10)_(-0.06)),
disequilibrium chemistry scenarios. We further discuss the implications of our
results in the context of planet formation. Additional observations at high and
low-resolution will be needed to confirm these results and better our

spectroscopically at high-resolution. A typical approach is to prepare
molecules in excited vibrational states via optical cycling and pumping, which
requires multiple high-power lasers. Here, we demonstrate a general method to
perform this spectroscopy without the need for optical cycling. We produce
molecules in excited vibrational states by using optically-driven chemical
reactions in a cryogenic buffer gas cell, and implement frequency-modulated
absorption to perform direct, sensitive, high-resolution spectroscopy. We
demonstrate this technique by measuring the spectrum of the
$\tilde{A}^2\Pi_{1/2}(1,0,0)-\tilde{X}^2\Sigma^+(3,0,0)$ band in $^{174}$YbOH.

critical interpretation in terms of working memory and altering participants
decisions. The interpretation process involves reference to argumentation
schemes (linked to critical questions (CQs)) in AGs. Interestingly, we found
that the participants chose more CQs (using argument schemes in AGs) when they
were less familiar with the argument topics, making AG schemes on some scales
(relatively) supportive of the interpretation process. Therefore, AGs were
considered to deliver a more critical approach to argument interpretation,
especially with unfamiliar topics. Based on the 25 participants conducted in

independent elastic constants. In the context of petroleum applications, it is
often challenging to accurately measure all these elastic parameters. At the
same time, the effect of elastic anisotropy can be noticeable and therefore
there is a need to include it in some form. To fill the gap, this study
proposes a three parameter elastic anisotropy model. It captures the dominant
anisotropic behavior and yet has only three elastic constants that are
relatively easy to measure in laboratory. The approach is based on upscaling of
a periodically layered material characterized by equal height layers with
different Young's moduli and the same Poisson's ratio. The resultant upscaled
material is transversely isotropic and is also physically admissible. The
developed approach allows to effectively reconstruct or estimate the values of
the two remaining parameters needed for the transversely isotropic model.

are known for convex potentials $V$, the situation is much more difficult in
the non-convex case, where algorithms necessarily suffer from the curse of
dimensionality in the worst case. For optimization, which can be seen as a
low-temperature limit of sampling, it is known that smooth functions $V$ allow
faster convergence rates. Specifically, for $m$-times differentiable functions
in $d$ dimensions, the optimal rate for algorithms with $n$ function
evaluations is known to be $O(n^{-m/d})$, where the constant can potentially
depend on $m, d$ and the function to be optimized. Hence, the curse of
dimensionality can be alleviated for smooth functions at least in terms of the
convergence rate. Recently, it has been shown that similarly fast rates can
also be achieved with polynomial runtime $O(n^{3.5})$, where the exponent $3.5$
is independent of $m$ or $d$. Hence, it is natural to ask whether similar rates
for sampling and log-partition computation are possible, and whether they can
be realized in polynomial time with an exponent independent of $m$ and $d$. We
show that the optimal rates for sampling and log-partition computation are
sometimes equal and sometimes faster than for optimization. We then analyze
various polynomial-time sampling algorithms, including an extension of a recent
promising optimization approach, and find that they sometimes exhibit
interesting behavior but no near-optimal rates. Our results also give further

typically reconstructed from data like DNA, RNA or protein alignments using
methods based on criteria like maximum parsimony (amongst others). Maximum
parsimony has been assumed to work well for data with only few state changes.
Recently, some progress has been made to formally prove this assertion. For
instance, it has been shown that each binary phylogenetic tree $T$ with $n \geq
20k$ leaves is uniquely defined by the set $A_k(T)$, which consists of all
characters with parsimony score $k$ on $T$. In the present manuscript, we show
that the statement indeed holds for all $n \geq 4k$, thus drastically lowering
the lower bound for $n$ from $20k$ to $4k$. However, it has been known that for
$n \leq 2k$ and $k \geq 3$, it is not generally true that $A_k(T)$ defines $T$.
We improve this result by showing that the latter statement can be extended
from $n \leq 2k$ to $n \leq 2k+2$. So we drastically reduce the gap of values
of $n$ for which it is unknown if trees $T$ on $n$ taxa are defined by $A_k(T)$
from the previous interval of $[2k+1,20k-1]$ to the interval $[2k+3,4k-1]$.
Moreover, we close this gap completely for the nearest neighbor interchange
(NNI) neighborhood of $T$, showing that as long as $n\geq 2k+3$, no tree that
is one NNI move away from $T$ (and thus very similar to $T$) shares the same
$A_k$ alignment.

steps: first, it estimates the model parameters (e.g., arrival rate and

often be highly sensitive to the parameter estimation errors because PTO is
unable to properly link these errors (step 1) to the quality of the optimized

path-dependent, i.e., inelastic, behavior of materials is a challenging task
and has been a focus in mechanics research for several decades. There have been
increased efforts to facilitate or automate this task through data-driven
techniques, impelled in particular by the recent revival of neural networks
(NNs) in computational mechanics. However, it seems questionable to simply not
consider fundamental findings of constitutive modeling originating from the
last decades research within NN-based approaches. Herein, we propose a
comparative study on different feedforward and recurrent neural network
architectures to model inelasticity. Within this study, we divide the models
into three basic classes: black box NNs, NNs enforcing physics in a weak form,
and NNs enforcing physics in a strong form. Thereby, the first class of
networks can learn constitutive relations from data while the underlying
physics are completely ignored, whereas the latter two are constructed such
that they can account for fundamental physics, where special attention is paid
to the second law of thermodynamics in this work. Conventional linear and
nonlinear viscoelastic as well as elastoplastic models are used for training
data generation and, later on, as reference. After training with random walk
time sequences containing information on stress, strain, and, for some models,
internal variables, the NN-based models are compared to the reference solution,
whereby interpolation and extrapolation are considered. Besides the quality of
the stress prediction, the related free energy and dissipation rate are
analyzed to evaluate the models. Overall, the presented study enables a clear
recording of the advantages and disadvantages of different NN architectures to
model inelasticity and gives guidance on how to train and apply these models.

control, where the relationship among users can be constructed in a graph

behaviors. Graph neural networks designed for undirected graphs usually
aggregate discriminative node or edge representations with an attention
strategy, but cannot fully exploit the out-degree information when used for the
tasks built on directed graph, which leads to the problem of a directional
bias. To tackle this problem, we propose a Directed Graph ATtention network
called DGAT, which explicitly takes out-degree into attention calculation. In
addition to having directional requirements, the same node might have different
representations of its input and output, and thus we further propose a dual
embedding of DGAT, referred to as DEDGAT. Specifically, DEDGAT assigns
in-degree and out-degree representations to each node and uses these two
embeddings to calculate the attention weights of in-degree and out-degree
nodes, respectively. Experiments performed on the benchmark datasets show that
DGAT and DEDGAT obtain better classification performance compared to undirected
GAT. Also,the visualization results demonstrate that our methods can fully use

of Internet video traffic, thereby posing severe challenges to network
management. Therefore, effectively identifying and managing video traffic has
become an urgent problem to be solved. However, the existing video traffic
feature extraction methods mainly target at the traditional packet and flow
level features, and the video traffic identification accuracy is low.
Additionally, the issue of high data dimension often exists in video traffic
identification, requiring an effective approach to select the most relevant
features to complete the identification task. Although numerous studies have
used feature selection to achieve improved identification performance, no
feature selection research has focused on measuring feature distributions that
do not overlap or have a small overlap. First, this study proposes to extract
video-related features to construct a large-scale feature set to identify video
traffic. Second, to reduce the cost of video traffic identification and select
an effective feature subset, the current research proposes an adaptive
distribution distance-based feature selection (ADDFS) method, which uses
Wasserstein distance to measure the distance between feature distributions. To
test the effectiveness of the proposal, we collected a set of video traffic
from different platforms in a campus network environment and conducted a set of
experiments using these data sets. Experimental results suggest that the
proposed method can achieve high identification performance for video scene
traffic and cloud game video traffic identification. Lastly, a comparison of
ADDFS with other feature selection methods shows that ADDFS is a practical
feature selection technique not only for video traffic identification, but also
for general classification tasks.

Instead of the mathematically parameterizing extinction curves, the extinction
curves in this work are directly from the silicate-graphite dust model, so that
the dust extinction law can be obtained and the dust properties can be analyzed
simultaneously. The ATLAS9 stellar model atmosphere is adopted for the
intrinsic SEDs in this work, while the silicate-graphite dust model with a dust
size distribution of $dn/da \sim a^{-\alpha}{\rm exp}(-a/a_c),~0.005 < a <
5~\mu{\rm m}$ for each component is adopted for the model extinction curves.
One typical extinction tracer in the dense region (V410 Anon9) and one in the
diffuse region (Cyg OB2 \#12) of the MW are chosen to test the reliability and
the practicability of the improved pair method in different stellar
environments. The results are consistent with their interstellar environments
and are in agreement with the previous observations and studies, which prove
that the improved pair method is effective and applicable in different stellar
environments. In addition to the reliable extinction results, the derived
parameters in the dust model can be used to analyze the dust properties, which
cannot be achieved by other methods with the mathematical extinction models.
With the improved pair method, the stellar parameters can also be inferred and

  Well-Established Physics","51 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.hist-ph gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  What goes into building a spacetime? This paper develops some powerful
mathematical tools (which I will call the ISE Methodology) for discovering and
negotiating between a wide range of alternate spacetime settings for nearly any
spacetime theory. The mathematics involved is relatively simple (i.e., no
algebraic geometry and no category theory). Moreover, the scope of
applicability is incredibly wide; These simple spacetime re-description
techniques are, in principle, applicable to every spacetime theory since
Newton. Unlike the algebraic approach to spacetime, the ISE Methodology does
not use a theory's algebraic structure in order to reconstruct its original
spacetime manifold. Instead, a wide range of new spacetime settings are offered
to us, based on nothing but our ability to smoothly vary the theory's states.
To build a new spacetime setting for a theory one first picks out a certain
kind of Lie group action on its states (which I will call pre-spacetime
translation operations). This kind of Lie group action is indistinguishable
from spacetime translations, structurally speaking. Using the techniques
introduced in this paper, one can then construct a new spacetime setting for
the theory in question such that these pre-spacetime translation operations
become honest-to-goodness spacetime translations in the new theory. These
spacetime re-description techniques will be demonstrated with three
illustrative example applications.

the information geometry, makes use of the Fisher Information Matrix instead of
the Hessian which is typically used. However, in many cases, the Fisher
Information Matrix is equivalent to the Generalized Gauss-Newton Method, that
both approximate the Hessian. It is an appealing method to be used as an
alternative to stochastic gradient descent, potentially leading to faster
convergence. However, being a second-order method makes it infeasible to be
used directly in problems with a huge number of parameters and data. This is
evident from the community of deep learning sticking with the stochastic
gradient descent method since the beginning. In this paper, we look at the
different perspectives on the natural gradient method, study the current
developments on its efficient-scalable empirical approximations, and finally
examine their performance with extensive experiments.

bidirectional recurrent neural network with dilated CNN (HARDC) method for
arrhythmia classification. This solves problems that arise when traditional
dilated convolutional neural network (CNN) models disregard the correlation
between contexts and gradient dispersion. The proposed HARDC fully exploits the
dilated CNN and bidirectional recurrent neural network unit (BiGRU-BiLSTM)
architecture to generate fusion features. As a result of incorporating both
local and global feature information and an attention mechanism, the model's
performance for prediction is improved.By combining the fusion features with a
dilated CNN and a hierarchical attention mechanism, the trained HARDC model
showed significantly improved classification results and interpretability of
feature extraction on the PhysioNet 2017 challenge dataset. Sequential Z-Score
normalization, filtering, denoising, and segmentation are used to prepare the
raw data for analysis. CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Network) is
then used to generate synthetic signals from the processed data. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HARDC model significantly
outperforms other existing models, achieving an accuracy of 99.60\%, F1 score
of 98.21\%, a precision of 97.66\%, and recall of 99.60\% using MIT-BIH
generated ECG. In addition, this approach substantially reduces run time when
using dilated CNN compared to normal convolution. Overall, this hybrid model
demonstrates an innovative and cost-effective strategy for ECG signal
compression and high-performance ECG recognition. Our results indicate that an
automated and highly computed method to classify multiple types of arrhythmia
signals holds considerable promise.

  dynamics","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strange metals exhibit universal linear-in-temperature resistivity described
by the Planckian scattering rate, the origin of which was not previously
understood. It was thought that phonons were disqualified as a prime agent, in
spite of their predominance in many other resistivity contexts. The problem
seems to have been not with phonons, but how they were treated. Here we show
that Planckian resistivity can in fact emerge from the \textit{nonperturbative}
scattering dynamics of thermal lattice vibrations and \textit{coherent} charge
carriers by a wave-on-wave approach. This becomes apparent when describing the
lattice vibrations in the coherent state representation, and treating charge
carriers as quantum wave packets negotiating the resulting dynamic disorder
field formed by lattice vibrations, the deformation potential. Under this
coherent and nonperturbative scattering dynamics, we find that carrier
velocities are suppressed, the quasiparticle picture breaks down and a new
phase called the vibronic fluid emerges. A competition between the static and
dynamic aspects of the random acoustic deformation potential is set up, leading
to a previously conjectured quantum bound of diffusion $\hbar/m^{*}$ with
universal properties. We successfully obtain the $T$-linear resistivity of
three different strange metals using their experimental parameters in our
numerical simulations. We explain the underlying mechanism for the Planckian
scattering based on the phenomenological model of Thouless scaling theory.
Furthermore, we provide explanations for the violation of the Mott-Ioffe-Regel
limit as well as the emergence of the displaced Drude peak in strange metals.

comprehensive thermodynamic model that allows us to determine the adiabatic

induced by a field change. Our model fits efficiently temperature versus time
and temperature change versus the inverse of the field change rate data for
three different materials presenting different i-caloric effects. The results

discharged from a single cough of a patient in a ventilated mock hospital
isolation room is investigated via computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
Healthcare worker (HCW) exposure to the aerosol is assessed through residence
time analysis of the aerosol transported through the imperfect mixing
conditions in the room. Flow features responsible for imperfect mixing,
including short-circuiting or channeling between the patient and exhaust air
vent (which leads to rapid expulsion of aerosols from the room), dead zones or
re-circulation flow regions in the room, and the turbulent diffusion or
spreading of aerosol across the room, are shown to play important factors
determining the HCW exposure to the aerosol. The importance of each of these
factors varies depending on the ventilation rate (ACH) and the placement of the
exhaust air vent relative to the patient. For example, reducing ACH from 12 to
6 diminishes the importance of these flow features and the aerosol transport
may be approximately modeled through the classical perfectly mixed assumption.
At ACH = 12, especially when the ceiling exhaust is placed above the patient
and the HCW, short-circuiting is the dominant feature in determining HCW
exposure. But when the ceiling exhaust is placed away from the patient and HCW,
the short-circuiting is weakened and the influence of dead zones, which trap
aerosol, and turbulent diffusion, which allow the aerosol to escape, becomes
more important. It is shown that the importance of these flow features and the
resulting impact on HCW exposure can be quantified in terms of residence time
distribution (RTD) metrics such as mean residence time and cumulative RTD. The
results suggest that residence time analysis is a useful technique to be
employed when designing a hospital isolation room and assessing HCW exposure to
aerosols.

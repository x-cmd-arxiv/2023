our recent work which proposes a technique for checking whether the fixpoint of
a function is the least (or the largest) admits a natural categorical
interpretation in terms of gs-monoidal categories.
  The technique is based on a construction that maps a function to a suitable

interpreted as a gs-monoidal functor. This guides the realisation of a tool,
called UDEfix that allows to build functions (and their approximations) like a

velocity and velocity dispersion maps from those of the observed galaxies. We
investigate whether the residual velocity and velocity dispersion maps show
indications for radial flows. We also carry out kinemetry, a model-independent
tool for detecting radial flows. We find that all nine galaxies exhibit
significant non-tangential flows. In six SFG, the inflow velocities

minor axis of these galaxies. In two cases the inflow appears to be off the
minor axis. The magnitudes of the radial motions are in broad agreement with
the expectations from analytic models of gravitationally unstable, gas rich
disks. Gravitational torques due to clump and bar formation, or spiral arms,
drive gas rapidly inward and result in the formation of central disks and large

outperforms other scSE-based UNet models in terms of Pratt's figure of merits

MTM learns versatile networks that can take on different roles or capabilities,
by simply choosing appropriate masks at inference time. For example, the same

even an offline RL agent. Through extensive experiments in several continuous

ask: what is the minimum probability $\rho(n)$, such that for any distribution
$\mathcal{G}$ (in this model) on graphs with $n$ vertices in which each
potential edge has a marginal probability of being present at least $\rho(n)$,
a graph drawn from $\mathcal{G}$ is connected with non-zero probability?
  As it turns out, the condition ``edges that do not share endpoints are

sensitive to the specification. In fact, we formalize this intuitive
description into a strict hierarchy of five independence conditions, which we
show to have at least three different behaviors for the threshold $\rho(n)$.
For each condition, we provide upper and lower bounds for $\rho(n)$. In the
strongest condition, the coloring model (which includes, e.g., random geometric
graphs), we prove that $\rho(n)\rightarrow 2-\phi\approx 0.38$ for
$n\rightarrow\infty$. This separates it from the weaker independence conditions
we consider, as there we prove that $\rho(n)>0.5-o(n)$. In stark contrast to
the coloring model, for our weakest independence condition -- pairwise
independence of non-adjacent edges -- we show that $\rho(n)$ lies within
$O(1/n^2)$ of the threshold for completely arbitrary distributions ($1-2/n$).

(PDMS) using a multi-pulse irradiation method and explored the impact of laser
energy, number of pulses per micron (writing speed), and laser spot size (NA)
on the process. The experimental results revealed that multi-void formation
occurred due to multi-pulse irradiation in the bulk of PDMS. Additionally,
increasing laser energy led to an increase in the number of voids, while the
number of voids did not change with an increase in the number of pulses per
micron for a fixed laser parameter. However, the size of the voids increased
with the number of pulses per micron, and tighter focusing conditions (higher
NA) resulted in smaller voids with a shorter distance between them.
Furthermore, Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations reproduced the
generation of void arrays in PDMS using a similar multi-laser pulse approach.
By modeling the voids as concentric spheres with densified shells and
simulating the laser interaction with the voids, we showed that void array
generation in PDMS is a linear mechanism. This study provides valuable insight
into the mechanism behind the formation of void arrays in PDMS. The simulation
results agrees well with the experimental results to further validate the model
and gain a better understanding of the physical processes involved in the
generation of void arrays in PDMS.

class of models by taking a fully parametric approach to generalized linear
mixed models with complex covariance dependence. The Laplace approximation is
used to marginally estimate covariance parameters while integrating out all
fixed and latent random effects. The Laplace approximation relies on
Newton-Raphson updates, which also leads to predictions for the latent random
effects. We develop methodology for complete marginal inference, from
estimating covariance parameters and fixed effects to making predictions for
unobserved data, for any patterned covariance matrix in the hierarchical
generalized linear mixed models framework. The marginal likelihood is developed
for six distributions that are often used for binary, count, and positive
continuous data, and our framework is easily extended to other distributions.
The methods are illustrated with simulations from stochastic processes with
known parameters, and their efficacy in terms of bias and interval coverage is
shown through simulation experiments. Examples with binary and proportional
data on election results, count data for marine mammals, and
positive-continuous data on heavy metal concentration in the environment are
used to illustrate all six distributions with a variety of patterned covariance
structures that include spatial models (e.g., geostatistical and areal models),
time series models (e.g., first-order autoregressive models), and mixtures with
typical random intercepts based on grouping.

with slightly different mean metallicities, the metal-poor (MP) stars with
[Fe/H] = $-$2.412$\pm$0.03, while the metal-rich (MR) ones with
$-$2.282$\pm$0.002. The MP constitutes about 23\% of the total mass with a more
central concentration. Our populational tagging based on the [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]
provides the mean n(P):n(I):n(E) = 32.2:31.6:36.2 ($\pm$2.4), where P, I, and E
denote the primordial, intermediate, and extreme populations, respectively. Our
populational number ratio is consistent with those of others. However, the MP
has a significantly different populational number ratio than the mean value,
and the domination of the primordial population in the MP is consistent with
observations of Galactic GCs that less massive GCs contain larger fractions of
the primordial population. Structural and constituent differences between the
MP and MR may indicate that M92 is a merger remnant in a dwarf galaxy
environment, consistent with recent suggestions that M92 is a GC in a dwarf
galaxy or a remnant nucleus of the progenitor galaxy. Discrepancy between our
method and those widely used for the HST photometry exists in the primordial
population. Significant magnesium and oxygen depletions of $-$0.8 and $-$0.3

chores) has given rise to a large body of work in recent years. A popular
approximate fairness notion is envy-freeness up to one item (EF1), which
requires that any pairwise envy can be eliminated by the removal of a single
item. While an EF1 and Pareto optimal (PO) allocation of goods always exists
and can be computed via several well-known algorithms, even the existence of
such solutions for chores remains open, to date. We take an epistemic approach
utilizing information asymmetry by introducing dubious chores -- items that
inflict no cost on receiving agents, but are perceived costly by others. On a
technical level, dubious chores provide a more fine-grained approximation of
envy-freeness -- compared to relaxations such as EF1 -- which enables progress
towards addressing open problems on the existence and computation of EF1 and
PO. In particular, we show that finding allocations with optimal number of
dubious chores is computationally hard even for highly restricted classes of
valuations. Nonetheless, we prove the existence of envy-free and PO allocations
for $n$ agents with only $2n-2$ dubious chores and strengthen it to $n-1$
dubious chores in four special classes of valuations. Our experimental analysis
demonstrate that baseline algorithms only require a relatively small number of
dubious chores to achieve envy-freeness in practice.

demonstrate that this correlation is more nuanced under subpopulation shifts.
Through rigorous experimentation and analysis across a variety of datasets,

nonlinear correlation with ID performance in subpopulation shifts. Our
findings, which contrast previous studies that have posited a linear
correlation in model performance during distribution shifts, reveal a ""moon

creates more nonlinear performance correlation. We provide complementary
experimental and theoretical analyses for this phenomenon, and discuss its

typically prohibitively expensive for k-nearest neighbor search. Consequently,
k-NN search is performed not with a cross-encoder, but with a heuristic
retrieve (e.g., using BM25 or dual-encoder) and re-rank approach. Recent work
proposes ANNCUR (Yadav et al., 2022) which uses CUR matrix factorization to
produce an embedding space for efficient vector-based search that directly
approximates the cross-encoder without the need for dual-encoders. ANNCUR
defines this shared query-item embedding space by scoring the test query
against anchor items which are sampled uniformly at random. While this
minimizes average approximation error over all items, unsuitably high
approximation error on top-k items remains and leads to poor recall of top-k
(and especially top-1) items. Increasing the number of anchor items is a
straightforward way of improving the approximation error and hence k-NN recall
of ANNCUR but at the cost of increased inference latency. In this paper, we
propose a new method for adaptively choosing anchor items that minimizes the
approximation error for the practically important top-k neighbors for a query
with minimal computational overhead. Our proposed method incrementally selects
a suitable set of anchor items for a given test query over several rounds,
using anchors chosen in previous rounds to inform selection of more anchor
items. Empirically, our method consistently improves k-NN recall as compared to
both ANNCUR and the widely-used dual-encoder-based retrieve-and-rerank
approach.

vice versa. In this work, we take a step back and ask, 'does it matter?' We
conduct the largest tabular data analysis to date, by comparing 19 algorithms
across 176 datasets, and we find that the 'NN vs. GBDT' debate is
overemphasized: for a surprisingly high number of datasets, either the
performance difference between GBDTs and NNs is negligible, or light
hyperparameter tuning on a GBDT is more important than selecting the best
algorithm. Next, we analyze 965 metafeatures to determine what properties of a

that GBDTs are much better than NNs at handling skewed feature distributions,
heavy-tailed feature distributions, and other forms of dataset irregularities.

then try to find the part played by entanglement in masking two different sets:
One, a set of mixed states formed by the classical mixtures of two single-qubit
pure commuting states, and another, a set of mixed states obtained by mixing
two single-qubit pure non-commuting states. For both cases, we show that the
masked states remain entangled unless the input state is an equal mixture of

regardless of their mixednesses and mutual commutativity.

describes a system of particles whose interactions are long-range. The model
exhibits first-order phase transitions in the canonical ensemble and,
therefore, a free energy barrier separates two free energy minima. The energy
of the system diffuses as a result of thermal fluctuations and we show that its
dynamics can be described by means of a Fokker-Planck equation. Considering an
initial state where the energy takes the value corresponding to one of the
minima of the free energy, we can define the lifetime of the initial state as
the mean first-passage time for the system to reach the top of the free energy
barrier between the minima. We use an analytical formula for the mean
first-passage time which is based on the knowledge of the exact free energy of
the model, even at a finite number of particles. This formula shows that the
lifetime of locally stable states increases exponentially in the number of
particles, which is a typical feature of systems with long-range interactions.
We also perform Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble in order to
obtain the probability distribution of the first-passage time, which turns out
to be exponential in time in a long time limit. The numerically obtained mean
first-passage time agrees with the theoretical prediction. Combining theory and
simulations, our work provides a new insight in the study of metastability in

defining subdomains. To address this issue, we consider an image registration
approach. The idea is to use the registration of an input magnetic resonance
image (MRI) to a respective target in order to obtain a new mesh from a
high-quality template mesh. To obtain the transformation, we solve an
optimization problem that is constrained by a linear hyperbolic transport
equation. We use a higher-order discontinuous Galerkin finite element method
for discretization and show that, under a restrictive assumption, the numerical
upwind scheme can be derived from the continuous weak formulation of the
transport equation. We present a numerical implementation that builds on the
established finite element packages FEniCS and dolfin-adjoint. To demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach, numerical results for the registration
of an input to a target MRI of two distinct individuals are presented.
Moreover, it is shown that the registration transforms a manually crafted input
mesh into a new mesh for the target subject whilst preserving mesh quality.
Challenges of the algorithm with the complex cortical folding structure are
discussed.

Quantum Hall systems to the electroweak sector of the Standard Model, but
defining them on the lattice has been an ongoing challenge due to a no-go
theorem precluding free local models, the potential of symmetry anomalies, and
sign problems. Some approaches define a $1+1$d chiral field theory as the edge
of a $2+1$d system and argue that the edge decouples from the bulk, but this
can be difficult to verify due to finite size effects and strong interactions.
On the other hand, recent work has shown how to define the $2+1$d bulk theory
as an exactly solvable model with zero correlation length, in which case the
edge theory may be extracted exactly. We use these techniques to derive a
lattice field theory on a $1+1$d spacetime lattice which carries an anomalous
chiral $U(1)$ symmetry with zero chiral central charge. The lattice theory with
anomalous chiral $U(1)$ symmetry is always gapless, regardless of lattice
interactions. We demonstrate the chiral anomaly by coupling to a background
gauge field, develop a field theory which demonstrates the chiral behavior, and
show how to assemble a chiral, anomaly-free theory where the gauge field may be
taken to be dynamical.

reasonably searched within extensions of the standard model that also explain
neutrino masses and mixing. Models embedding the minimal seesaw mechanism can
explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe via
leptogenesis and dark matter via active-sterile neutrino mixing. In this case a
keV lightest seesaw neutrino would play the role of warm dark matter particle.
This traditional solution is now constrained by various cosmological
observations. I will discuss the possibility that a much heavier but yet
metastable (dark) right-handed neutrino with mass in the $1\,{\rm TeV}$--$1 \,
{\rm PeV}$ range can play the role of (cold) dark matter particle. The right
abundance would be produced by the Higgs induced mixing with a seesaw
right-handed neutrino (RHINO model), i.e., by sterile-sterile neutrino mixing.
Such a mixing would necessarily require a further extension of the minimal
seesaw mechanism and can be described by a dimension-five effective operator.
The same mixing would also necessarily induce dark neutrino instability with
lifetimes that can be much longer than the age of the universe and can escape
current constraints from neutrino telescopes. On the other hand, a contribution
to very high energy neutrino flux produced by dark neutrino decays could
explain an anomalous excess at 100 TeV energies confirmed recently by the
IceCube collaboration. I will also discuss a simple UV completion where the
mediator is given by a massive fermion. Intriguingly, it comes out that the
favoured scale of new physics for RHINO to satisfy the dark matter requirements
coincides with the grand-unified scale: a RHINO miracle.

  MACS0647$-$JD","21 pages, 6 figures, submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed
$z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST
imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a
spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII]
$\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII]
$\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII]
$\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission
lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang.
Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase
metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$,
ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon
production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The
spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$
damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings
beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$
damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly
overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a
stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7
M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr)
with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius
$70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older
($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously.
Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\
3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is
likely the most distant galaxy merger known.

photo-realism, but are difficult to animate and do not generalize well to

implicit 3D morphable face models that are both generalizable and intuitive for
editing. Trained from a collection of high-quality 3D scans, our face model is
parameterized by geometry, expression, and texture latent codes with a learned
SDF and explicit UV texture parameterization. Once trained, we can reconstruct
an avatar from a single in-the-wild image by leveraging the learned prior to
project the image into the latent space of our model. Our implicit morphable
face models can be used to render an avatar from novel views, animate facial
expressions by modifying expression codes, and edit textures by directly
painting on the learned UV-texture maps. We demonstrate quantitatively and
qualitatively that our method improves upon photo-realism, geometry, and

3D point cloud segmentation and object detection but also have linear
complexity and is scalable for large-scale point clouds. The key challenge in
applying transformers to point clouds is reducing the quadratic, thus
overwhelming, computation complexity of attentions. To combat this issue,
several works divide point clouds into non-overlapping windows and constrain
attentions in each local window. However, the point number in each window
varies greatly, impeding the efficient execution on GPU. Observing that
attentions are robust to the shapes of local windows, we propose a novel octree
attention, which leverages sorted shuffled keys of octrees to partition point
clouds into local windows containing a fixed number of points while permitting
shapes of windows to change freely. And we also introduce dilated octree
attention to expand the receptive field further. Our octree attention can be
implemented in 10 lines of code with open-sourced libraries and runs 17 times
faster than other point cloud attentions when the point number exceeds 200k.
Built upon the octree attention, OctFormer can be easily scaled up and achieves
state-of-the-art performances on a series of 3D segmentation and detection
benchmarks, surpassing previous sparse-voxel-based CNNs and point cloud
transformers in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, on the

issues on quality, reliability, diversity, self-consistency, and undesirable

SELF-ALIGN, which combines principle-driven reasoning and the generative power
of LLMs for the self-alignment of AI agents with minimal human supervision. Our
approach encompasses four stages: first, we use an LLM to generate synthetic
prompts, and a topic-guided method to augment the prompt diversity; second, we
use a small set of human-written principles for AI models to follow, and guide
the LLM through in-context learning from demonstrations (of principles
application) to produce helpful, ethical, and reliable responses to user's
queries; third, we fine-tune the original LLM with the high-quality
self-aligned responses so that the resulting model can generate desirable
responses for each query directly without the principle set and the
demonstrations anymore; and finally, we offer a refinement step to address the
issues of overly-brief or indirect responses. Applying SELF-ALIGN to the

demonstrate our efficacy, we construct a new segmentation dataset, PerSeg, for
personalized evaluation, and test our methods on video object segmentation with

limited by surface-noise-induced spin dephasing and relaxation. In this work,
we significantly reduce magnetic surface noise by engineering core-shell
structures, which in combination with dynamical decoupling result in qubit
coherence times (T2) ranging from 52us to 87us - a drastic improvement over the
1.1us to 35us seen in bare particles. This improvement in spin coherence,
combined with an overall increase in particle fluorescence, corresponds to a
two-order-of-magnitude reduction in integration time. Probing qubit dynamics at
a single particle level, furthermore, reveals that the noise characteristics
fundamentally change from a bath with spins that rearrange their spatial
configuration during the course of an experiment to a more dilute static bath.
The observed results shed light on the underlying mechanisms governing spin
dephasing in diamond nanocrystals and offer an effective noise mitigation

appears as a typical high-mass early-type galaxy (ETG). However, the galaxy
hosts two distinct nuclei in its center. We use high-signal MUSE (Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer) spectral observations and novel triaxial dynamical
orbit models to reveal a surprisingly isotropic central orbit distribution in
NGC 5419. Recent collisionless simulations of merging massive ETGs suggest a
two-phase core formation model, in which the low-density stellar core forms
rapidly by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) sinking into the center due to
dynamical friction. Only afterwards the SMBHs form a hard binary and the black
hole scouring process slowly changes the central orbit distribution from
isotropic to tangential. The observed cored density profile, the double nucleus
and the isotropic center of NGC 5419 together thus point to an intermediate
evolutionary state where the first phase of the core formation has taken place,
yet the scouring process is only beginning. This implies that the double
nucleus is a SMBH binary. Our triaxial dynamical models indicate a total mass
of the two SMBHs in the center of NGC 5419 of MBH = (1.0 +/- 0.08) 10^10 Msol.
Moreover, we find that NGC 5419's complex kinematically distinct core (KDC) can
be explained by a coherent flip of the orbital rotation direction of stars on
tube orbits at ~3kpc distance from the galaxy center together with projection
effects. This is also in agreement with merger simulations hosting SMBHs in the

have been drawn from the Planck SZ catalogue and cover a wide range of masses,
M$_{500}=[2-15] \times 10^{14} $M$_{\odot}$, and redshift, z=[0.05,0.6]. We
derived the surface brightness and emission measure profiles and determined the
statistical properties of the full sample. We found that there is a critical
scale, R$\sim 0.4 R_{500}$, within which morphologically relaxed and disturbed
object profiles diverge. The median of each sub-sample differs by a factor of
$\sim 10$ at $0.05\,R_{500}$. There are no significant differences between
mass- and redshift-selected sub-samples once proper scaling is applied. We
compare CHEX-MATE with a sample of 115 clusters drawn from the The Three
Hundred suite of cosmological simulations. We found that simulated emission
measure profiles are systematically steeper than those of observations. For the
first time, the simulations were used to break down the components causing the
scatter between the profiles. We investigated the behaviour of the scatter due
to object-by-object variation. We found that the high scatter, approximately
110%, at $R<0.4R_{500}$ is due to a genuine difference between the distribution
of the gas in the core. The intermediate scale, $R_{500} =[0.4-0.8]$, is
characterised by the minimum value of the scatter on the order of 0.56,
indicating a region where cluster profiles are the closest to the self-similar
regime. Larger scales are characterised by increasing scatter due to the
complex spatial distribution of the gas. Also for the first time, we verify
that the scatter due to projection effects is smaller than the scatter due to
genuine object-by-object variation in all the considered scales. [abridged]

to the acute problem of global warming. For the first time, we herein introduce
trialkylsulfonium aprotic ionic liquids (ILs) as a group of seemingly highly
capacitive CO2 scavengers. We advocate the viability of the new sorbents by the
reaction profiles recorded by means of hybrid density functional theory. All
stages constituting CO2 chemisorption, such as the ethyldimethylsulfonium
S211-cation deprotonation, S211-ylide carboxylation at the alpha-methylene
group, and aprotic anion carboxamidation have been explored. The S211-ylide
formation reaction is thermochemically forbidden but its cost is affordable.
The energetic cost ranges from a tiny number of 14 kJ/mol for S211 indazolide
to a mediocre value of 50 kJ/mol for S211 1,2,4-triazolide. The barriers
corresponding to the sulfonium-based cation deprotonation range from 39 kJ/mol
for benzimidazolide to +60 kJ/mol for 1,2,4-triazolide. The energy loss during
the ylide intermediate formation is strongly compensated for by the subsequent
sulfonium ylide carboxylation. The energetic gain is weakly dependent on the
nature of the heterocyclic aprotic anion being 99 to 110 kJ/mol for different
ionic species studied. The AHAs additionally participate in CO2 capture
following the route of carboxamidation thanks to their nitrogen sites. The most
thermochemically favorable carbamate forms out of S211-indazolide, 68 kJ/mol.
The steric and covalent barriers associated with these reactions are of the
order of thermal motion energy, whereas a specific chemical structure of AHA
engenders marginal differences. The rationalization of the energy reaction
profiles is given in terms of partial atomic charges, geometrical
peculiarities, steric barriers, imaginary vibrational frequencies, and related
descriptors.

assist humans in fulfilling their information needs through conversations. The
task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and
answer-unaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the
expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions
recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the
answer-unaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly
select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the
conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as
in reality, the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are
not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide
the type of question to be generated (boolean/span-based) implicitly. Modeling
the question type explicitly is crucial as the answer, which hints the models
to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we
present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a
sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct,
and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier
determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control
signals before generating and filtering. In addition, we propose Conv-Distinct,
a novel evaluation metric for CQG, to evaluate the diversity of the generated
conversation from a context. Compared with the existing answer-unaware CQG
models, the proposed SG-CQG achieves state-of-the-art performance.

  of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background",,,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) originates
from numerous faint sub-threshold gravitational wave (GW) signals arising from
the coalescing binary compact objects. This background is expected to be
discovered from the current (or next-generation) network of GW detectors by
cross-correlating the signal between multiple pairs of GW detectors. However,
detecting this signal is challenging and the correlation is only detectable at
low frequencies due to the arrival time delay between different detectors. In
this work, we propose a novel technique, \texttt{Spectrogram Correlated
Stacking} (or \texttt{SpeCs}), which goes beyond the usual cross-correlation
(and to higher frequencies) by exploiting the higher-order statistics in the
time-frequency domain which accounts for the \textit{chirping} nature of the
individual events that comprise SGWB. We show that \texttt{SpeCs} improves the
signal-to-noise for the detection of SGWB by a factor close to $8$, compared to
standard optimal cross-correlation methods which are tuned to measure only the
power spectrum of the SGWB signal.\texttt{SpeCs} can probe beyond the power
spectrum and its application to the GW data available from the current and
next-generation GW detectors would speed up the SGWB discovery.

well-suited. However, most anomaly localization research in machine learning
focuses on non-medical datasets, and we find that these methods fall short when
adapted to medical imaging datasets. The problem is alleviated when we solve
the task from the image completion perspective, in which the presence of
anomalies can be indicated by a discrepancy between the original appearance and
its auto-completion conditioned on the surroundings. However, there are often
many valid normal completions given the same surroundings, especially in the
DBT dataset, making this evaluation criterion less precise. To address such an
issue, we consider pluralistic image completion by exploring the distribution
of possible completions instead of generating fixed predictions. This is
achieved through our novel application of spatial dropout on the completion
network during inference time only, which requires no additional training cost
and is effective at generating diverse completions. We further propose minimum
completion distance (MCD), a new metric for detecting anomalies, thanks to
these stochastic completions. We provide theoretical as well as empirical

however, in the presence of models affected by uncertainty, the optimization
formulation needs to be extended to consider statistics of the quantity of

requires uncertainty quantification analyses at several design locations. The
cost of OUU is proportional to the cost of performing a forward uncertainty
analysis at each design location visited, which makes the computational burden
too high for high-fidelity simulations with significant computational cost.
From a high-level standpoint, an OUU workflow typically has two main
components: an inner loop strategy for the computation of statistics of the
quantity of interest, and an outer loop optimization strategy tasked with
finding the optimal design, given a merit function based on the inner loop
statistics. In this work, we propose to alleviate the cost of the inner loop
uncertainty analysis by leveraging the so-called Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
method. MLMC has the potential of drastically reducing the computational cost
by allocating resources over multiple models with varying accuracy and cost.
The resource allocation problem in MLMC is formulated by minimizing the
computational cost given a target variance for the estimator. We consider MLMC
estimators for statistics usually employed in OUU workflows and solve the
corresponding allocation problem. For the outer loop, we consider a
derivative-free optimization strategy implemented in the SNOWPAC library; our
novel strategy is implemented and released in the Dakota software toolkit. We

affects the magnitude and location of secular resonances of the short period

full understanding of the salt effect remains an outstanding challenge. Here,
we develop a molecular theory which systematically incorporates the

thermodynamics. The electrostatic interaction, hydrophobicity, ion solvation
and translational entropy are included in a unified framework. Our theory fully
captures the long-standing puzzles of the non-monotonic salt concentration

at low salt concentrations due to ionic screening. The solubility follows the
inverse Hofmeister series. In the high salt concentration regime, protein
remains salting-out for small ions but turns to salting-in for larger ions,
accompanied by the reversal of the Hofmeister series. We reveal that the
solubility at high salt concentrations is determined by the competition between
the solvation energy and translational entropy of ion. Furthermore, we derive
an analytical criterion for determining the boundary between the salting-in and

with probability $1 - \delta$, where $m = O(\varepsilon^{-2} \log 1/\delta)$
and each column of $A$ has $O(\varepsilon m)$ non-zero entries. The previous
analyses of the Sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform all assumed access to a

of this paper is a more general analysis of the Sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss
Transform with less assumptions on the hash function. We also show that the
\emph{Mixed Tabulation hash function} of Dahlgaard, Knudsen, Rotenberg, and
Thorup (FOCS 2015) satisfies the conditions of our analysis, thus giving us the
first analysis of a Sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform that works with a
practical hash function.

into executable SQLs, has gained increasing attention in recent years. In
particular, Codex and ChatGPT have shown impressive results in this task.
However, most of the prevalent benchmarks, i.e., Spider, and WikiSQL, focus on
database schema with few rows of database contents leaving the gap between
academic study and real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, we present
Bird, a big benchmark for large-scale database grounded in text-to-SQL tasks,
containing 12,751 pairs of text-to-SQL data and 95 databases with a total size
of 33.4 GB, spanning 37 professional domains. Our emphasis on database values
highlights the new challenges of dirty database contents, external knowledge
between NL questions and database contents, and SQL efficiency, particularly in
the context of massive databases. To solve these problems, text-to-SQL models
must feature database value comprehension in addition to semantic parsing. The
experimental results demonstrate the significance of database values in
generating accurate text-to-SQLs for big databases. Furthermore, even the most
effective text-to-SQL models, i.e. ChatGPT, only achieves 40.08% in execution
accuracy, which is still far from the human result of 92.96%, proving that
challenges still stand. Besides, we also provide an efficiency analysis to
offer insights into generating text-to-efficient-SQLs that are beneficial to
industries. We believe that BIRD will contribute to advancing real-world
applications of text-to-SQL research. The leaderboard and source code are

  Supervised Semantic Segmentation","10 pages, 10 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A surge of interest has emerged in weakly supervised semantic segmentation
due to its remarkable efficiency in recent years. Existing approaches based on
transformers mainly focus on exploring the affinity matrix to boost CAMs with
global relationships. While in this work, we first perform a scrupulous
examination towards the impact of successive affinity matrices and discover
that they possess an inclination toward sparsification as the network
approaches convergence, hence disclosing a manifestation of over-smoothing.
Besides, it has been observed that enhanced attention maps tend to evince a
substantial amount of extraneous background noise in deeper layers. Drawing
upon this, we posit a daring conjecture that the undisciplined over-smoothing
phenomenon introduces a noteworthy quantity of semantically irrelevant
background noise, causing performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, we
propose a novel perspective that highlights the objects of interest by
investigating the regions of the trait, thereby fostering an extensive
comprehension of the successive affinity matrix. Consequently, we suggest an
adaptive re-activation mechanism (AReAM) that alleviates the issue of
incomplete attention within the object and the unbounded background noise.
AReAM accomplishes this by supervising high-level attention with shallow
affinity matrices, yielding promising results. Exhaustive experiments conducted
on the commonly used dataset manifest that segmentation results can be greatly
improved through our proposed AReAM, which imposes restrictions on each
affinity matrix in deep layers to make it attentive to semantic regions.

heterogeneities. These fixed effects are typically incidental parameters and
their estimators converge slowly relative to the square root of the sample
size. In the maximum likelihood context, this induces an asymptotic bias of the
likelihood function. Test statistics derived from the asymptotically biased
likelihood, therefore, no longer follow their standard limiting distributions.
This causes severe distortions in test sizes. We consider a generic class of
dynamic nonlinear models with two-way fixed effects and propose an analytical
bias correction method for the likelihood function. We formally show that the
likelihood ratio, the Lagrange-multiplier, and the Wald test statistics derived
from the corrected likelihood follow their standard asymptotic distributions.
As a by-product, a bias-corrected estimator of the structural parameter can
also be derived from the corrected likelihood function. We evaluate the

is transformed by a monotonic nonlinearity to emit measurable fitness. Here we
demonstrate that minimizing contrastive loss functions, such as the
Bradley-Terry loss, is a simple and flexible technique for extracting the
sparse latent function implied by global epistasis. We argue by way of a
fitness-epistasis uncertainty principle that the nonlinearities in global
epistasis models can produce observed fitness functions that do not admit
sparse representations, and thus may be inefficient to learn from observations
when using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss (a common practice). We show that
contrastive losses are able to accurately estimate a ranking function from

practical utility of this insight by showing contrastive loss functions result

finite-temperature normal-ordered second quantization, which is fully developed
in this study, including a proof of thermal Wick's theorem and the derivation

a nonlinear dynamical model for the human lower limb that takes into account

amount of data generated on edge devices, which are often processed using AI
algorithms. On-device learning enables edge platforms to continually adapt the
AI models to user personal data and further allows for a better service
quality. However, AI training on resource-limited devices is extremely
difficult because of the intensive computing workload and the significant
amount of on-chip memory consumption exacted by deep neural networks (DNNs). To
mitigate this, we propose to use embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM)
as the main storage medium of training data. Compared with static random-access
memory (SRAM), eDRAM introduces more than $2\times$ improvement on storage
density, enabling reduced off-chip memory traffic. However, to keep the stored
data intact, eDRAM is required to perform the power-hungry data refresh
operations.
  eDRAM refresh can be eliminated if the data is stored for a period of time
that is shorter than the eDRAM retention time. To achieve this, we design a
novel reversible DNN architecture that enables a significantly reduced data
lifetime during the training process and removes the need for eDRAM refresh. We
further design an efficient on-device training engine, termed~\textit{CAMEL},
that uses eDRAM as the main on-chip memory. CAMEL enables the intermediate
results during training to fit fully in on-chip eDRAM arrays and completely
eliminates the off-chip DRAM traffic during the training process. We evaluate
our CAMEL system on multiple DNNs with different datasets, demonstrating a more
than $3\times$ saving on total DNN training energy consumption than the other
baselines, while achieving a similar (even better) performance in validation
accuracy.

challenging identifiability and estimation problems. In this work, we propose a
singular value decomposition (SVD) based spectral approach to GoM analysis with
multivariate binary responses. Our approach hinges on the observation that the
expectation of the data matrix has a low-rank decomposition under a GoM model.
For identifiability, we develop sufficient and almost necessary conditions for
a notion of expectation identifiability. For estimation, we extract only a few
leading singular vectors of the observed data matrix, and exploit the simplex
geometry of these vectors to estimate the mixed membership scores and other
parameters. Our spectral method has a huge computational advantage over
Bayesian or likelihood-based methods and is scalable to large-scale and

efficiency and accuracy of our method. We also illustrate our method by

policy is based on an analysis of vertex-wise inclusion probabilities (VIP)
during multi-hop neighborhood sampling, which may expand the neighborhood far

elimination of the communication bottleneck, but it also offers a means to
organize in-memory data by prioritizing GPU storage for the most frequently

  Our theory reveals the existence of a new topological invariant, called the
expander degree, applicable to a particular class of compact, smooth
4-orbifolds with boundary. This invariant is roughly equal to a signed count of
all possible gradient expanding solitons that can be defined on the interior of
the orbifold and are asymptotic to any fixed cone metric with non-negative

\mathbb{E}_{F}{l(X)} = \int_{\chi} l(\mathbf{x}) d F(\mathbf{x})$ is a
fundamental challenge. Such integrals are crucial for evidence estimation,
which is important for various purposes, including model selection and
numerical analysis. The existing strategies for evidence estimation are
classified into four categories: deterministic approximation, density
estimation, importance sampling, and vertical representation (Llorente et al.,
2020). In this paper, we show that the Riemann sum estimator due to Yakowitz
(1978) can be used in the context of nested sampling (Skilling, 2006) to
achieve a $O(n^{-4})$ rate of convergence, faster than the usual Ergodic
Central Limit Theorem. We provide a brief overview of the literature on the
Riemann sum estimators and the nested sampling algorithm and its connections to
vertical likelihood Monte Carlo. We provide theoretical and numerical arguments
to show how merging these two ideas may result in improved and more robust
estimators for evidence estimation, especially in higher dimensional spaces. We
also briefly discuss the idea of simulating the Lorenz curve that avoids the
problem of intractable $\Lambda$ functions, essential for the vertical
representation and nested sampling.

approach reduces to the chain mapping technique. When considering several tens
of field modes, we have found that tensor network simulation of two atoms in

explore the allowed parameter space for this DM candidate from relic abundance

resolution with the ALMA Array. Spectra and maps of H$_2$O and OH observed with
an angular resolution of 20 to $\sim$200 mas were obtained at two epochs with
the ALMA array. Observations with the Compact Array were also used to check for
time variability of water transitions. Radiative transfer models of water were
revisited to characterize masing conditions and up-to-date chemical models were
used for comparison with our observations. Ten rotational transitions of H$_2$O

one are new detections in space, and from these we have derived accurate rest

using redundant dark fibers enables to monitor traffic at low cost with low

piezoelectric sensors, and smartphones, but they are limited due to privacy
concerns and/or deployment requirements. Previous studies attempted to use
telecommunication cables for traffic monitoring, but they were only exploratory
and limited to simple tasks at a coarse granularity, e.g., vehicle detection,
due to their hardware constraints and real-world challenges. In particular,
those challenges are 1) unknown and heterogeneous properties of virtual sensors
and 2) large and complex noise conditions. To this end, our TelecomTM system
first characterizes the geographic location and analyzes the signal pattern of
each virtual sensor through driving tests. We then develop a spatial-domain
Bayesian filtering and smoothing algorithm to detect, track, and characterize
each vehicle. Our approach uses the spatial dependency of multiple virtual
sensors and Newton's laws of motion to combine the distributed sensor data to
reduce uncertainties in vehicle detection and tracking. In our real-world
evaluation on a two-way traffic road with 1120 virtual sensors, TelecomTM
achieved 90.18% vehicle detection accuracy, 27$\times$ and 5$\times$ error
reduction for vehicle position and speed tracking compared to a baseline

a vector of noise conditioned on measurement data as input and yields the
predicted constitutive relationship, which is scrutinized by the discriminator
in the following step. We demonstrate that this framework can accurately

  Intercalation from Data in Mathematical Models of Lithium-ion Batteries","46 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Most mathematical models of the transport of charged species in battery
electrodes require a constitutive relation describing intercalation of Lithium,
which is a reversible process taking place on the interface between the
electrolyte and active particle. The most commonly used model is the
Butler-Volmer relation, which gives the current density as a product of two
expressions: one, the exchange current, depends on Lithium concentration only
whereas the other expression depends on both Lithium concentration and on the
overpotential. We consider an inverse problem where an optimal form of the
exchange current density is inferred, subject to minimum assumptions, from
experimental voltage curves. This inverse problem is recast as an optimization
problem in which the least-squares error functional is minimized with a
suitable Sobolev gradient approach. The proposed method is thoroughly validated
and we also quantify the reconstruction uncertainty. Finally, we identify the
universal features in the constitutive relations inferred from data obtained
during charging and discharging at different C-rates and discuss how these
features differ from the behaviour predicted by the standard Butler-Volmer
relation. We also identify possible limitations of the proposed approach,
mostly related to uncertainties inherent in the material properties assumed
known in the inverse problem. Our approach can be used to systematically
improve the accuracy of mathematical models employed to describe Li-ion
batteries as well as other systems relying on the Butler-Volmer relation.

Recent work has shown that virtual IMU data extracted from videos using

Inspired by recent advances in motion synthesis from textual descriptions and
connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) to various AI models, we introduce an

generate 3D human motion sequences via a motion synthesis model, T2M-GPT, and
later converted to streams of virtual IMU data. We benchmarked our approach on

significantly improved HAR model performance compared to only using real IMU

understanding and controlling nonequilibrium dynamics of a system. We here
elucidate that the speed of an observable of our interest can be tighter
bounded when we have knowledge of other observables, such as experimentally
accessible ones or conserved quantities. We prove this by introducing a new
concept, ""quantum velocity limit,"" which is a universal inequality of a
velocity vector for multiple observables and improves conventional speed limits
for a single observable. We first derive an information-theoretical velocity
limit in terms of the generalized correlation matrix of the observables and the
quantum Fisher information. The velocity limit has various novel consequences,
some of which are particularly noteworthy: (I) Conservation law in the system,
a fundamental ingredient of quantum dynamics, can improve the velocity and
speed limits through the correlation between the observables and conserved
quantities; (II) Speed of an observable can be bounded by a nontrivial lower
bound from the information on another observable, while most of the previous
speed limits provide only upper bounds; (III) There exists a new tradeoff
relation in nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics, i.e., speeds of
uncorrelated observables cannot be simultaneously large; (IV) Velocity and
speed limits for observables on a subsystem in locally interacting many-body
systems remain convergent even in the thermodynamic limit, unlike the naive
application of the conventional speed limits. Moreover, we discover another
distinct velocity limit for multiple observables on the basis of the local
conservation law of probability current, which becomes advantageous for
macroscopic transitions of multiple quantities.

deformation is vital for elucidating the deformation mechanism of amorphous

events, which are topological rearrangements of particles, and the associated
microscopic stresses in dense packings of photoelastic disks under pure shear.
We observe a remarkable similarity between the evolution of the total number of
T1 events and the global stress-strain curve. The competition between the birth
and death of T1 events establishes a dynamic equilibrium after the yield
strain, contributing to the overall plastic behavior. Despite the erratic
stress fluctuations of individual T1 events, the local stresses decrease on
average once T1 events occur, indicating their soft characteristics.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the microscopic stress fluctuations exhibit a
long-range anisotropic spatial correlation similar to the Eschelby character,
but with a distinct scaling of $r^{-1.5}$. Interestingly, we also find a
striking similarity in the correlation functions of T1 and non-T1 regions.
These findings establish a significant connection between macroscopic
mechanical behavior and the elementary deformation of T1 events, shedding light

contact-scale plastic deformation.

evolution of galaxy morphology. Much discussion has surrounded how lenticular
galaxies may form a bridging population between elliptical and spiral galaxies.
However, with recourse to a galaxy's central black hole mass, accretion-built
spiral galaxies have emerged as the bridging population between low-mass
lenticular galaxies and the dusty merger-built lenticular galaxies contiguous
with elliptical galaxies and `brightest cluster galaxies' in the black
hole/galaxy mass diagram. Spiral galaxies, including the Milky Way, appear
built from gas accretion and minor mergers onto what were initially lenticular
galaxies. These connections are expressed as a new morphology sequence, dubbed
the `Triangal', which subsumes elements of the Hubble sequence and the van den
Bergh trident and reveals the bridging nature of the often overlooked ellicular
galaxies. Furthermore, a quadratic black hole/galaxy mass relation is found to
describe ordinary elliptical galaxies. The relation is roughly parallel to the
quadratic-like relations observed for the central spheroidal component of
spiral galaxies, dust-rich lenticular galaxies, and old dust-poor lenticular
galaxies. The brightest cluster galaxies are offset according to expectations
from an additional major merger. The findings have implications for feedback
from active galactic nuclei, mapping morphology into simulations, and
predicting gravitational wave signals from colliding supermassive black holes.
A new galaxy speciation model is presented. It disfavours the `monolithic
collapse' scenario for spiral, dusty lenticular, and elliptical galaxies. It
reveals substantial orbital angular momentum in the Universe's first galaxies

costs and quantum error correction (QEC) overheads. For problems of interest,
FTQC will require millions of physical qubits with long coherence times,
high-fidelity gates, and compact sizes to surpass classical systems. Just as
heterogeneous specialization has offered scaling benefits in classical
computing, it is likewise gaining interest in FTQC. However, systematic use of
heterogeneity in either hardware or software elements of FTQC systems remains a
serious challenge due to the vast design space and variable physical
constraints.
  This paper meets the challenge of making heterogeneous FTQC design practical
by introducing HetArch, a toolbox for designing heterogeneous quantum systems,
and using it to explore heterogeneous design scenarios. Using a hierarchical
approach, we successively break quantum algorithms into smaller operations
(akin to classical application kernels), thus greatly simplifying the design
space and resulting tradeoffs. Specializing to superconducting systems, we then
design optimized heterogeneous hardware composed of varied superconducting
devices, abstracting physical constraints into design rules that enable devices
to be assembled into standard cells optimized for specific operations. Finally,
we provide a heterogeneous design space exploration framework which reduces the
simulation burden by a factor of 10^4 or more and allows us to characterize
optimal design points. We use these techniques to design superconducting
quantum modules for entanglement distillation, error correction, and code
teleportation, reducing error rates by 2.6x, 10.7x, and 3.0x compared to

impractical to attempt acquiring every possible interacting motion, as the
combination of physical parameters increases exponentially. The proposed PMP
allows us to assemble multiple part skills to animate a character, creating a
diverse set of motions with different combinations of existing data. In our
pipeline, we can train an agent with a wide range of part-wise priors.
Therefore, each body part can obtain a kinematic insight of the style from the
motion captures, or at the same time extract dynamics-related information from
the additional part-specific simulation. For example, we can first train a
general interaction skill, e.g. grasping, only for the dexterous part, and then
combine the expert trajectories from the pre-trained agent with the kinematic
priors of other limbs. Eventually, our whole-body agent learns a novel physical
interaction skill even with the absence of the object trajectories in the

Here we experimentally realize convolution operations in the synthetic

recommended to avoid unexpected changes in the latest version of a package.
However, version pinning in Dockerfiles is not yet fully realized (only 17k of
the 141k Dockerfiles we analyzed), because of the difficulties caused by
version pinning. To maintain Dockerfiles with version-pinned packages, it is
important to update package versions, not only for improved functionality, but
also for software supply chain security, as packages are changed to address
vulnerabilities and bug fixes. However, when updating multiple version-pinned
packages, it is necessary to understand the dependencies between packages and
ensure version compatibility, which is not easy. To address this issue, we
explore the applicability of the meta-maintenance approach, which aims to
distribute the successful updates in a part of a group that independently
maintains a common artifact. We conduct an exploratory analysis of 7,914
repositories on GitHub that hold Dockerfiles, which retrieve packages on GitHub
by URLs. There were 385 repository groups with the same multiple package
combinations, and 208 groups had Dockerfiles with newer version combinations

positive ring-exchange interaction $J_{\rm R}>0$ there indeed appears an exotic
non-collinear triple-$\bf Q$ ordered state featured by three Bragg peaks at
symmetry-related M points in the crystallographic Brillouin zone. A magnetic
field in the honeycomb plane can suppress the triple-$\bf Q$ order and induce a
gapless quantum spin liquid (QSL) with 8 cones. Furthermore, with the increase
of $J_{\rm R}$ a proximate Kitaev spin liquid with eight Majorana cones labeled
as the PKSL8 is found which is very stable under a large range of $\Gamma$
interactions. The PKSL8 state shares the same projective symmetry group with
the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) which is located at small $\Gamma$ and $J_{\rm

turns into an Abelian chiral spin liquid with Chern number $\nu=-4$, unlike the
KSL which yields a chiral spin liquid with $\nu=1$. Since the triple-$\bf Q$

Furthermore, these approaches often struggle in scenarios where grasping points
are occluded by the clothing item itself. To address the above challenges, we
propose a novel Bi-directional Fractal Cross Fusion Network (BiFCNet) for
semantic segmentation, enabling recognition of graspable regions in order to
provide more possibilities for grasping. Instead of using depth images only, we
also utilize RGB images with rich color features as input to our network in
which the Fractal Cross Fusion (FCF) module fuses RGB and depth data by
considering global complex features based on fractal geometry. To reduce the
cost of real data collection, we further propose a data augmentation method
based on an adversarial strategy, in which the color and geometric
transformations simultaneously process RGB and depth data while maintaining the
label correspondence. Finally, we present a pipeline for clothes grasping and
unfolding from the perspective of semantic segmentation, through the addition
of a strategy for grasp point selection from segmentation regions based on
clothing flatness measures, while taking into account the grasping direction.

they have not considered that the channel is time-varying wherein deep fading
occurs occasionally. Moreover, the importance of each semantic feature differs
from each other. Consequently, the important features may be affected by
channel fading and corrupted, resulting in performance degradation. Therefore,
higher performance can be achieved by avoiding the transmission of important
features when the channel state is poor. In this paper, we propose a scheme of
Feature Arrangement for Semantic Transmission (FAST). In particular, we aim to
schedule the transmission order of features and transmit important features
when the channel state is good. To this end, we first propose a novel metric
termed feature priority, which takes into consideration both feature importance
and feature robustness. Then, we perform channel prediction at the transmitter
side to obtain the future channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, the
feature arrangement module is developed based on the proposed feature priority
and the predicted CSI by transmitting the prior features under better CSI.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the
performance of image transmission compared to existing semantic communication

Debye shielding causes the ion kinetic energy to quickly increase. For the

plasma. The electron-ion mass ratio is taken to be the smallest parameter in
the BBGKY hierarchy, smaller even than the reciprocal of the plasma parameter.
This ordering differs from conventional kinetic theory by making the electron
collision rates faster than the ion plasma frequency, which allows stronger
coupling and makes the ion heating a function only of the total energy supplied
to the electrons. The calculation uses known formulas for correlations in a
two-temperature plasma, for which a new, elementary derivation is presented.
Suprathermal ions can be created more rapidly by this mechanism than by

magnetic fields parallel and perpendicular to the $b$-axis of NiBi$_3$, we
establish that its lower- and upper critical fields, as well as the magnetic
penetration depths show slightly different values, suggesting a weakly
anisotropic superconductivity. In both cases, the zero-temperature upper
critical fields are much smaller than the Pauli-limit value, indicating that
the superconducting state is constrained by the orbital pair breaking. The
temperature evolution of the superfluid density, obtained from transverse-field
$\mu$SR, reveals a fully-gapped superconductivity in NiBi$_3$, with a shared
superconducting gap $\Delta_0$ = 2.1 $k_\mathrm{B}$$T_c$ and magnetic
penetration depths $\lambda_0$ = 223 and 210 nm for $H \parallel b$- and $H

that time-reversal symmetry is preserved in NiBi$_3$. The absence of a fast
muon-spin relaxation and/or precession in the zero-field $\mu$SR spectra

diverse settings ranging from smartphones and autonomous vehicles to the
healthcare industry and space technology. By interfacing multiple sensors that
collectively interact with the signal to be measured, one can go beyond the
signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) than those attainable by the individual
constituting elements. Such distributed sensing techniques have also been
implemented in the quantum regime, where a linear increase in the SNR has been
achieved via using entangled states. Along similar lines, coupled non-
Hermitian systems have provided yet additional degrees of freedom to obtain
better sensors via higher-order exceptional points. Quite recently, a new class
of non-Hermitian systems, known as non-Hermitian topological sensors (NTOS) has
been theoretically proposed. Remarkably, the synergistic interplay between
non-Hermiticity and topology is expected to bestow such sensors with an
enhanced sensitivity that grows exponentially with the size of the sensor
network. Here, we experimentally demonstrate NTOS using a network of photonic
time-multiplexed resonators in the synthetic dimension represented by optical
pulses. By judiciously programming the delay lines in such a network, we
realize the archetypical Hatano-Nelson model for our non-Hermitian topological
sensing scheme. Our experimentally measured sensitivities for different lattice
sizes confirm the characteristic exponential enhancement of NTOS. We show that
this peculiar response arises due to the combined synergy between
non-Hermiticity and topology, something that is absent in Hermitian topological
lattices. Our demonstration of NTOS paves the way for realizing sensors with
unprecedented sensitivities.

phase errors be estimated in a single shot of DH data. The digital holography
model-based iterative reconstruction (DH-MBIR) algorithm is capable of
accurately estimating phase errors in a single shot using the expectation

require hundreds of iterations, which is not practical for real-time
applications. In this paper, we present the Dynamic DH-MBIR (DDH-MBIR)
algorithm for estimating isoplanatic phase errors from streaming single-shot
data with extremely low latency. The Dynamic DH-MBIR algorithm reduces the
computation and latency by orders of magnitude relative to conventional
DH-MBIR, making real-time throughput and latency feasible in applications.
Using simulated data that models frozen flow of atmospheric turbulence, we show
that our algorithm can achieve a consistently high Strehl ratio with realistic

  Checking",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Chinese Spell Checking(CSC), a task to detect erroneous characters
in a sentence and correct them, has attracted extensive interest because of its
wide applications in various NLP tasks. Most of the existing methods have
utilized BERT to extract semantic information for CSC task. However, these
methods directly take sentences with only a few errors as inputs, where the
correct characters may leak answers to the model and dampen its ability to
capture distant context; while the erroneous characters may disturb the
semantic encoding process and result in poor representations. Based on such
observations, this paper proposes an n-gram masking layer that masks current
and/or surrounding tokens to avoid label leakage and error disturbance.
Moreover, considering that the mask strategy may ignore multi-modal information
indicated by errors, a novel dot-product gating mechanism is proposed to
integrate the phonological and morphological information with semantic
representation. Extensive experiments on SIGHAN datasets have demonstrated that
the pluggable n-gram masking mechanism can improve the performance of prevalent
CSC models and the proposed methods in this paper outperform multiple powerful

and semi-structured data, parallelization of graph algorithms is inevitable.
Unfortunately, due to inherent irregularity of computation, memory access, and
communication, graph algorithms are traditionally challenging to parallelize.
To tame this challenge, several libraries, frameworks, and domain-specific
languages (DSLs) have been proposed to reduce the parallel programming burden
of the users, who are often domain experts. However, existing frameworks to
model graph algorithms typically target a single architecture. In this paper,
we present a graph DSL, named StarPlat, that allows programmers to specify
graph algorithms in a high-level format, but generates code for three different
backends from the same algorithmic specification. In particular, the DSL
compiler generates OpenMP for multi-core, MPI for distributed, and CUDA for
many-core GPUs. Since these three are completely different parallel programming
paradigms, binding them together under the same language is challenging. We
share our experience with the language design. Central to our compiler is an
intermediate representation which allows a common representation of the
high-level program, from which individual backend code generations begin. We
demonstrate the expressiveness of StarPlat by specifying four graph algorithms:
betweenness centrality computation, page rank computation, single-source
shortest paths, and triangle counting. We illustrate the effectiveness of our
approach by comparing the performance of the generated codes with that obtained
with hand-crafted library codes. We find that the generated code is competitive
to library-based codes in many cases. More importantly, we show the feasibility
to generate efficient codes for different target architectures from the same
algorithmic specification of graph algorithms.

non-ideal MHD three-dimensional simulations. Rotation, especially differential,
more strongly and diversely affects the nonlinear state than the linear stage
(where we confirm the most important conclusions of analytical models), and
stronger than any linear analyses predict. Steady state magnetic fields are
stronger and cosmic ray energy density higher than in comparable nonrotating
systems. Transient gas outflows induced by the nonlinear instability persist
longer, of order 2 Gyr, with rotation. Stratification combined with
(differential) rotation drives helical flows, leading to mean-field dynamo.
Consequently, the nonlinear state becomes oscillatory (while both the linear
instability and the dynamo are non-oscillatory). The horizontal magnetic field
near the midplane reverses its direction propagating to higher altitudes as the
reversed field spreads buoyantly. The spatial pattern of the large-scale
magnetic field may explain the alternating magnetic field directions in the
halo of the edge-on galaxy NGC 4631. Our model is unique in producing a
large-scale magnetic structure similar to such observation. Furthermore, our
simulations show that the mean kinetic helicity of the magnetically driven
flows has the sign opposite to that in the conventional non-magnetic flows.
This has profound consequences for the nature of the dynamo action and
large-scale magnetic field structure in the coronae of spiral galaxies which
remain to be systematically explored and understood. We show that the energy
density of cosmic rays and magnetic field strength are not correlated at scales

that of the basis images. An empirical, but highly effective, two-step
data-domain-decomposition (DDD) method has been developed and used widely for
quantitative image reconstruction in MSCT. In the two-step DDD method, step (1)
estimates the so-called basis sinogram from data through solving a nonlinear

Hamiltonians that describe interacting, non-interacting, integrable, and
non-integrable systems, including random local Hamiltonians and translational
invariant random local Hamiltonians. In all these scenarios, we find that the
PCA complexity grows rapidly in time before approaching a plateau. The dynamics
of the PCA complexity can vary quantitatively and qualitatively as a function
of the Hamiltonian parameters and measurement protocol. Importantly, the
dynamics of PCA complexity present behavior that is considerably less sensitive
to the specific system parameters for models which lack simple local dynamics,

we find the energy barriers of cluster rotation in quasi-tetragonal monolayer
C60 structures are rather low (about 10 meV/atom). The small rotational energy
barriers lead to a series of tetragonal C60 polymorphs with energies that are
close to the experimental quasi-tetragonal (expt-qT) phase. Similarly, several

methods for DFER can achieve better performances but result in higher FLOPs and
computational costs. To solve these problems, the local-global spatio-temporal
Transformer (LOGO-Former) is proposed to capture discriminative features within
each frame and model contextual relationships among frames while balancing the
complexity. Based on the priors that facial muscles move locally and facial
expressions gradually change, we first restrict both the space attention and
the time attention to a local window to capture local interactions among
feature tokens. Furthermore, we perform the global attention by querying a
token with features from each local window iteratively to obtain long-range
information of the whole video sequence. In addition, we propose the compact

minimum intra-class distance and the maximum inter-class distance. Experiments

dataset into a tiny dataset. It is a promising approach to accelerate neural
network training and related studies. Different approaches have been proposed
to improve the informativeness and generalization performance of distilled
images. However, no work has comprehensively analyzed this technique from a
security perspective and there is a lack of systematic understanding of
potential risks. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
current state-of-the-art dataset distillation methods. We successfully use
membership inference attacks to show that privacy risks still remain. Our work
also demonstrates that dataset distillation can cause varying degrees of impact
on model robustness and amplify model unfairness across classes when making
predictions. This work offers a large-scale benchmarking framework for dataset
distillation evaluation.

for knowledge-base question answering (KBQA). However, complex KBQA is a more
challenging task that requires to perform complex multi-step reasoning.
Recently, a new semantic parser called KoPL has been proposed to explicitly
model the reasoning processes, which achieved the state-of-the-art on complex
KBQA. In this paper, we further explore how to unlock the reasoning ability of
semantic parsers by a simple proposed parse-execute-refine paradigm. We refine
and improve the KoPL parser by demonstrating the executed intermediate
reasoning steps to the KBQA model. We show that such simple strategy can
significantly improve the ability of complex reasoning. Specifically, we
propose three components: a parsing stage, an execution stage and a refinement
stage, to enhance the ability of complex reasoning. The parser uses the KoPL to
generate the transparent logical forms. Then, the execution stage aligns and
executes the logical forms over knowledge base to obtain intermediate reasoning
processes. Finally, the intermediate step-by-step reasoning processes are
demonstrated to the KBQA model in the refinement stage. With the explicit
reasoning processes, it is much easier to answer the complex questions.
Experiments on benchmark dataset shows that the proposed PER-KBQA performs
significantly better than the stage-of-the-art baselines on the complex KBQA.

simple and intuitive component patterns. Through this approach, we can
gradually define the view and synthesis paths to an abstract model built on top

has raised concerns about their potential for exhibiting ill-behaviors. While
DNN verification and testing provide post hoc conclusions regarding unexpected
behaviors, they do not prevent the erroneous behaviors from occurring. To
address this issue, DNN repair/patch aims to eliminate unexpected predictions
generated by defective DNNs. Two typical DNN repair paradigms are retraining
and fine-tuning. However, existing methods focus on the high-level abstract
interpretation or inference of state spaces, ignoring the underlying neurons'
outputs. This renders patch processes computationally prohibitive and limited
to piecewise linear (PWL) activation functions to great extent. To address
these shortcomings, we propose a behavior-imitation based repair framework,
BIRDNN, which integrates the two repair paradigms for the first time. BIRDNN
corrects incorrect predictions of negative samples by imitating the closest
expected behaviors of positive samples during the retraining repair procedure.
For the fine-tuning repair process, BIRDNN analyzes the behavior differences of
neurons on positive and negative samples to identify the most responsible
neurons for the erroneous behaviors. To tackle more challenging domain-wise
repair problems (DRPs), we synthesize BIRDNN with a domain behavior
characterization technique to repair buggy DNNs in a probably approximated
correct style. We also implement a prototype tool based on BIRDNN and evaluate
it on ACAS Xu DNNs. Our experimental results show that BIRDNN can successfully
repair buggy DNNs with significantly higher efficiency than state-of-the-art
repair tools. Additionally, BIRDNN is highly compatible with different
activation functions.

(NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to get insights in these systems
thanks to its ability to distinguish between bulk and adsorbed species and to
its sensitivity to dynamic phenomena. Nevertheless, a clear interpretation of
the experimental results is sometimes rendered difficult by the various factors
affecting NMR spectra. A mesoscopic model to predict NMR spectra of ions
diffusing in carbon particles is adapted to include dynamic exchange between
the intra-particle space and the bulk electrolyte surrounding the particle. A
systematic study of the particle size effect on the NMR spectra for different
distributions of magnetic environments in the porous carbons is conducted. The
model demonstrates the importance of considering a range of magnetic
environments, instead of a single chemical shift value corresponding to
adsorbed species, and of including a range of exchange rates (between in and
out of the particle), instead of a single timescale, to predict realistic NMR
spectra. Depending on the pore size distribution of the carbon particle and the
ratio between bulk and adsorbed species, both the NMR linewidth and peak

the given subject based on the text descriptions, which has drawn increasing
attention recently. Existing methods mainly resort to finetuning a pretrained
generative model, where the identity-relevant information and the
identity-irrelevant information are entangled in the latent embedding space.
However, the highly entangled latent embedding may lead to the failure of
subject-driven text-to-image generation as follows: (i) the identity-irrelevant
information hidden in the entangled embedding may dominate the generation
process, resulting in the generated images heavily dependent on the irrelevant
information while ignoring the given text descriptions; (ii) the
identity-relevant information carried in the entangled embedding can not be
appropriately preserved, resulting in identity change of the subject in the
generated images. To tackle the problems, we propose DisenBooth, an
identity-preserving disentangled tuning framework for subject-driven
text-to-image generation in this paper. Specifically, DisenBooth finetunes the
pretrained diffusion model in the denoising process. Different from previous
works that utilize an entangled embedding to denoise each image, DisenBooth
instead utilizes disentangled embeddings to respectively preserve the subject
identity and capture the identity-irrelevant information. We further design the
novel weak denoising and contrastive embedding auxiliary tuning objectives to
achieve the disentanglement. Extensive experiments show that our proposed
DisenBooth framework outperforms baseline models for subject-driven
text-to-image generation with the identity-preserved embedding. Additionally,
by combining the identity-preserved embedding and identity-irrelevant
embedding, DisenBooth demonstrates more generation flexibility and
controllability.

distributions, where minority classes are significantly underrepresented
compared to the majority ones. Recent research prefers to utilize multi-expert

collaborative learning is employed to aggregate the knowledge of experts, i.e.,
online distillation. In this paper, we observe that the knowledge transfer
between experts is imbalanced in terms of class distribution, which results in
limited performance improvement of the minority classes. To address it, we
propose a re-weighted distillation loss by comparing two classifiers'
predictions, which are supervised by online distillation and label annotations,
respectively. We also emphasize that feature-level distillation will
significantly improve model performance and increase feature robustness.
Finally, we propose an Effective Collaborative Learning (ECL) framework that

Quantitative and qualitative experiments on four standard datasets demonstrate
that ECL achieves state-of-the-art performance and the detailed ablation

  We improve the best published approximation factor for the uniform

resulting in shorter training times than local training. FedCBMIR was evaluated
in two experiments with three scenarios on BreaKHis and Camelyon17 (CAM17). The
study shows that the FedCBMIR method increases the F1-Score (F1S) of each

While quantum optimization has historically centered around Quadratic
Unconstrained Optimization (QUBO) problems, recent studies show, that many

problems in practice also contain continuous variables, our contribution
investigates the performance of the QAOA in solving continuous optimization

suitable benchmark functions, shows that PUBO formulations generally yield
better results, while requiring less qubits. As the multi-qubit interactions
needed for the PUBO variant have to be decomposed using the hardware gates
available, i.e., currently single- and two-qubit gates, the circuit depth of
the PUBO approach outscales its QUBO alternative roughly linearly in the order

temperatures are reached in the inner 0.1 AU during thermal instability bursts.
In our 1D time-dependent code the disc and an embedded planet interact through
gravity, heat, and mass exchange. We use disc viscosity constrained by
simulations and observations of dwarf novae instabilities, and we constrain
planet properties with a stellar evolution code. We show that dusty gas giants
born in the outer self-gravitating disc reach the innermost disc in a $\sim$
10,000 years with radius of $\sim 10 R_J$. We show that their EE rates are
$\sim 10^{-5}$ Msun/yr; if this exceeds the background disc accretion activity

millions or billions of trainable parameters, and therefore tend to overfit to
the training data. This is especially problematic in applications where it is
important to have reliable uncertainty estimates. Bayesian neural networks
(BNN) can improve on this, since they incorporate parameter uncertainty. In
addition, latent binary Bayesian neural networks (LBBNN) also take into account
structural uncertainty by allowing the weights to be turned on or off, enabling
inference in the joint space of weights and structures. In this paper, we will
consider two extensions to the LBBNN method: Firstly, by using the local
reparametrization trick (LRT) to sample the hidden units directly, we get a
more computationally efficient algorithm. More importantly, by using
normalizing flows on the variational posterior distribution of the LBBNN
parameters, the network learns a more flexible variational posterior
distribution than the mean field Gaussian. Experimental results show that this
improves predictive power compared to the LBBNN method, while also obtaining
more sparse networks. We perform two simulation studies. In the first study, we
consider variable selection in a logistic regression setting, where the more
flexible variational distribution leads to improved results. In the second
study, we compare predictive uncertainty based on data generated from
two-dimensional Gaussian distributions. Here, we argue that our Bayesian
methods lead to more realistic estimates of predictive uncertainty.

Gamma matrices and can be exactly solved by mapping to $n$ species of itinerant
Majorana fermions coupled to a static $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. Their phase
diagrams include a critical point described by the SO($n$)$_1$
Wess-Zumino-Witten model as well as two distinct gapped phases. We show that
one of the gapped phases is a trivial phase and the other realizes a
symmetry-protected topological phase when $n \geq 2$. These two gapped phases
are proved to be related to each other by a Kramers-Wannier duality.
Furthermore, other elegant structures in the transverse-field Ising chain, such
as the infinite-dimensional Onsager algebra, also carry over to our models.

utilizes an LLM to iteratively generate additional semantically meaningful
features for tabular datasets based on the description of the dataset. The
method produces both Python code for creating new features and explanations for
the utility of the generated features.
  Despite being methodologically simple, CAAFE improves performance on 11 out
of 14 datasets - boosting mean ROC AUC performance from 0.798 to 0.822 across
all dataset - similar to the improvement achieved by using a random forest
instead of logistic regression on our datasets.
  Furthermore, CAAFE is interpretable by providing a textual explanation for

noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices and for the quest towards
fault-tolerant quantum computation. Rydberg arrays have emerged as a prominent
platform in this context with impressive system sizes and proposals suggesting
how error-correction thresholds could be significantly improved by detecting
leakage errors with single-atom resolution, a form of erasure error conversion.
However, two-qubit entanglement fidelities in Rydberg atom arrays have lagged
behind competitors and this type of erasure conversion is yet to be realized
for matter-based qubits in general. Here we demonstrate both erasure conversion
and high-fidelity Bell state generation using a Rydberg quantum simulator. We
implement erasure conversion via fast imaging of alkaline-earth atoms, which
leaves atoms in a metastable state unperturbed and yields additional
information independent of the final qubit readout. When excising data with
observed erasure errors, we achieve a lower-bound for the Bell state generation
fidelity of ${\geq} 0.9971^{+10}_{-13}$, which improves to
${\geq}0.9985^{+7}_{-12}$ when correcting for remaining state preparation
errors. We further demonstrate erasure conversion in a quantum simulation
experiment for quasi-adiabatic preparation of long-range order across a quantum
phase transition, where we explicitly differentiate erasure conversion of
preparation and Rydberg decay errors. We unveil the otherwise hidden impact of
these errors on the simulation outcome by evaluating correlations between
erasures and the final readout as well as between erasures themselves. Our work
demonstrates the capability for Rydberg-based entanglement to reach fidelities
in the ${\sim} 0.999$ regime, with higher fidelities a question of technical
improvements, and shows how erasure conversion can be utilized in NISQ devices.

heat up their interior depending on their orbital and interior properties. We
aim to identify a Tidally Heated Exomoon's (THEM) orbital parameter space that
would make it observable in infrared wavelengths with MIRI/JWST around
$\epsilon$ Eridani b. We study the possible constraints on orbital eccentricity
and interior properties that a successful THEM detection in infrared
wavelengths can bring. We also investigate what exomoon properties need to be
independently known in order to place these constraints. We use a coupled
thermal-tidal model to find stable equilibrium points between the tidally
produced heat and heat transported within a moon. For the latter, we consider a
spherical and radially symmetric satellite with heat being transported via
magma advection in a sub-layer of melt (asthenosphere) and convection in the
lower mantle. We incorporate uncertainties in the interior and tidal model
parameters to assess the fraction of simulated moons that would be observable
with MIRI. We find that a $2 R_{Io}$ THEM orbiting $\epsilon$ Eridani b with an
eccentricity of 0.02, would need to have a semi-major axis of 4 planetary
Roche-radii for 100% of the simulations to produce an observable moon. These
values are comparable with the orbital properties of gas giant solar system
satellites. We place similar constraints for eccentricities up to 0.1. We
conclude that if the semi-major axis and radius of the moon are known (eg. with
exomoon transits), tidal dissipation can constrain the orbital eccentricity and
interior properties of the satellite, such as the presence of melt and the
thickness of the melt containing sub-layer.

the onset of the formation of the Solar System. Space missions, telescopic
observations and laboratory analyses advanced the knowledge on the properties
of cometary dust. Cometary samples were returned from comet 81P/Wild2 by the
Stardust mission. The chondritic (porous) anhydrous interplanetary dust
particles and chondritic porous micrometeorites, and the ultracarbonaceous
Antarctic micrometeorites (UCAMMs) also show strong evidence for a cometary
origin. The composition of cometary dust is generally chondritic, but with high
C and N compared with CI. The cometary organic matter is mixed with minor
amounts of crystalline and amorphous minerals. The most abundant crystalline
minerals are ferromagnesian silicates, refractory minerals and low Ni Fe
sulfides are also present. The presence of carbonates in cometary dust is still
debated, but a phyllosilicate-like phase was observed in a UCAMM. GEMS phases
are usually abundant. Some of the organic matter present in cometary dust
particle resembles the insoluble organic matter present in primitive
meteorites, but amorphous carbon and exotic (e.g. N-rich) organic phases are
also present. The H isotopic composition of the organic matter traces a
formation at very low temperatures, in the protosolar cloud or in the outer
regions of the protoplanetary disk. The presolar dust concentration in cometary
dust can reach about 1%, which is the most elevated value observed in
extraterrestrial samples. The differential size distribution of cometary dust
in comet trails is well represented by a power-law distribution with a mean
power index N typically ranging from -3 to -4. Polarimetric and light
scattering studies suggest mixtures of porous agglomerates of sub-micrometer
minerals with organic matter. Cometary dust particles have low tensile
strength, and low density.

providing new functionalities in nanomagnet-based devices. Here, we create
coupled Ising-like nanomagnets in which the coupling between adjacent
nanomagnetic regions can be reversibly converted between parallel and
antiparallel through solid-state ionic gating. This is achieved with the
voltage-control of magnetic anisotropies in a nanosized region where the

the same real-world entity. State-of-the-art entity matching methods often rely
on fine-tuning Transformer models such as BERT or RoBERTa. Two major drawbacks
of using these models for entity matching are that (i) the models require
significant amounts of fine-tuning data for reaching a good performance and
(ii) the fine-tuned models are not robust concerning out-of-distribution
entities. In this paper, we investigate using ChatGPT for entity matching as a
more robust, training data-efficient alternative to traditional Transformer
models. We perform experiments along three dimensions: (i) general prompt
design, (ii) in-context learning, and (iii) provision of higher-level matching
knowledge. We show that ChatGPT is competitive with a fine-tuned RoBERTa model,
reaching an average zero-shot performance of 83% F1 on a challenging matching
task on which RoBERTa requires 2000 training examples for reaching a similar
performance. Adding in-context demonstrations to the prompts further improves
the F1 by up to 5% even using only a small set of 20 handpicked examples.
Finally, we show that guiding the zero-shot model by stating higher-level

from military to industrial applications. Despite all the benefits they offer,
their misuse can lead to mishaps, and tackling them becomes more challenging
particularly at night due to their small size and low visibility conditions. To
overcome those limitations and improve the detection accuracy at night, we
propose an object detector called Ghost Auto Anchor Network (GAANet) for
infrared (IR) images. The detector uses a YOLOv5 core to address challenges in
object detection for IR images, such as poor accuracy and a high false alarm
rate caused by extended altitudes, poor lighting, and low image resolution. To
improve performance, we implemented auto anchor calculation, modified the
conventional convolution block to ghost-convolution, adjusted the input channel
size, and used the AdamW optimizer. To enhance the precision of multiscale tiny
object recognition, we also introduced an additional extra-small object feature
extractor and detector. Experimental results in a custom IR dataset with
multiple classes (birds, drones, planes, and helicopters) demonstrate that
GAANet shows improvement compared to state-of-the-art detectors. In comparison
to GhostNet-YOLOv5, GAANet has higher overall mean average precision (mAP@50),
recall, and precision around 2.5\%, 2.3\%, and 1.4\%, respectively. The dataset

model (GMM) was proposed for frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. This
scheme provides high flexibility regarding various system parameters and is

multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) communications. The GMM is learned to cover the
operation of all mobile terminals (MTs) located inside the base station (BS)
cell, and each MT only needs to evaluate its strongest mixture component as
feedback, eliminating the need for channel estimation at the MT. In this work,
we extend the GMM-based feedback scheme to variable feedback lengths by
leveraging a single learned GMM through merging or pruning of dispensable
mixture components. Additionally, the GMM covariances are restricted to
Toeplitz or circulant structure through model-based insights. These extensions
significantly reduce the offloading amount and enhance the clustering ability
of the GMM which, in turn, leads to an improved system performance. Simulation
results for both point-to-point and multi-user systems demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed extensions.

outcome of a responsibility delegated to the method. The slices will be
non-overlapping if the slicing criteria address the same output variable. The
slices are further extracted as independent methods, invoked by the original

rather than the specific steps required to achieve it; these steps may vary
depending on the specific rule-application context. Existing
graph-transformation approaches either require a separate rule to be written
for every possible application context or lack the ability to constrain the
maximal change that a rule will create. We introduce effect-oriented graph
transformation, shifting the semantics of a rule from specifying actions to
representing the desired effect. A single effect-oriented rule can encode a
large number of induced classic rules. Which of the potential actions is
executed depends on the application context; ultimately, all ways lead to Rome.
If a graph element to be deleted (created) by a potential action is already

show how matches can be computed without explicitly enumerating all induced

is non invasiveness, i.e., a negligible perturbation to the thermal sample.
However, invasiveness is rarely investigated explicitly. Here, focusing on a
pure-dephasing spin probe in a bosonic sample, we show that there is a
non-trivial relation between the information on the temperature gained by a
quantum probe and the heat absorbed by the sample due to the interaction. We
show that optimizing over the probing time, i.e. considering a time-optimal
probing scheme, also has the benefit of limiting the heat absorbed by the
sample in each shot of the experiment. For such time-optimal protocols, we show
that it is advantageous to have very strong probe-sample coupling, since in
this regime the accuracy increases linearly with the coupling strength, while
the amount of heat per shot saturates to a finite value. Since in
pure-dephasing models the absorbed heat corresponds to the external work needed
to couple and decouple the probe and the sample, our results also represent a
first step towards the analysis of the thermodynamic and energetic cost of
quantum thermometry.

proportional to the quantum mixture of the two hybrid valence bands at the
$\Gamma$ point. Due to the strong hybridization, the peak separation of more
than 0.5 eV can be resolved in ARPES experiments. Our study provides a concrete
recipe of how to directly visualize hybrid excitons and how to distinguish them
from the usually observed regular excitonic signatures.

quantify XCO at two different spatial resolutions, we exploit a dust-based
method together with ALMA 12-m and ACA data and HI maps of three nearby
metal-poor starbursts, NGC625, NGC1705, and NGC5253. Dust opacity at 250pc
resolution is derived based on dust temperatures estimated by fitting
two-temperature modified blackbodies to Herschel PACS data. By using the HI
maps, we are then able to estimate dust-to-gas ratios in the atomic-gas
dominated regions, and infer total gas column densities and H2 column densities
as the difference with HI. Finally, from the ACA CO(1-0) maps, we derive XCO.
We use a similar technique with 40 pc ALMA 12-m data for the three galaxies,
but instead derive dust attenuation at 40 pc resolution from reddening maps
based on VLT/MUSE data. At 250 pc resolution, XCO $\sim$ 10^22 - 10^23 cm^-2 /
K.km/s, 5-1000 times the Milky Way value, with much larger values than would be
expected from a simple metallicity dependence. Instead at 40 pc resolution, XCO
again shows large variation, but is roughly consistent with a power-law
metallicity dependence, given the Z $\sim$ 1/3 Zsun metal abundances of our
targets. The large scatter in both estimations could imply additional parameter
dependence, that we have investigated by comparing XCO with the observed
velocity-integrated brightness temperatures, ICO, as predicted by recent
simulations. Indeed, larger XCO is significantly correlated with smaller ICO,
but with slightly different slopes and normalizations than predicted by theory.
Such behavior can be attributed to the increasing fraction of CO-faint H2 gas
with lower spatial resolution. This confirms the idea the XCO is multi-variate,
depending not only on metallicity but also on CO brightness temperature and
beam size.

Language is a proxy for embodiment and if a metaphor is conventional and

automata, and logics have been investigated and used, for example, to verify
programs with arithmetic expressions and exceptions (both of which are
deterministic pushdown but lie outside the scope of the visibly pushdown
languages). In this paper, we complete the picture and give, for the first
time, an algebraic characterization of the class of OPLs in the form of a
syntactic congruence that has finitely many equivalence classes exactly for the
operator precedence languages. This is a generalization of the celebrated
Myhill-Nerode theorem for the regular languages to OPLs. As one of the
consequences, we show that universality and language inclusion for
nondeterministic operator precedence automata can be solved by an antichain
algorithm. Antichain algorithms avoid determinization and complementation
through an explicit subset construction, by leveraging a quasi-order on words,
which allows the pruning of the search space for counterexample words without
sacrificing completeness. Antichain algorithms can be implemented symbolically,
and these implementations are today the best-performing algorithms in practice
for the inclusion of finite automata. We give a generic construction of the
quasi-order needed for antichain algorithms from a finite syntactic congruence.
This yields the first antichain algorithm for OPLs, an algorithm that solves
the \textsc{ExpTime}-hard language inclusion problem for OPLs in exponential

Existing mainstream GPU programming languages, such as CUDA and OpenCL, are

data races and deadlocks.
  In this paper, we present Descend: a safe GPU systems programming language.
In the spirit of Rust, Descend's type system enforces safe CPU and GPU memory
management by tracking Ownership and Lifetimes. Descend introduces a new
holistic GPU programming model where computations are hierarchically scheduled
over the GPU's execution resources: grid, blocks, and threads. Descend's
extended Borrow checking ensures that execution resources safely access memory
regions without introducing data races. For this, we introduced views
describing safe parallel access patterns of memory regions.

evaluate our implementation of Descend using a number of benchmarks, showing
that no significant runtime overhead is introduced compared to manually written

analyze their smoothness with a special attention to specific values of the
demand at which the support of the Wardrop equilibrium exhibits a phase
transition with an abrupt change in the set of optimal routes. Typically, when
such a phase transition occurs, the price of anarchy function has a breakpoint,
\ie is not differentiable. We prove that, if the demand varies proportionally
across all commodities, then, at a breakpoint, the largest left or right
derivatives of the price of anarchy and of the social cost at equilibrium, are
associated with the smaller equilibrium support. This proves -- under the
assumption of proportional demand -- a conjecture of o'Hare et al. (2016), who
observed this behavior in simulations. We also provide counterexamples showing
that this monotonicity of the one-sided derivatives may fail when the demand
does not vary proportionally, even if it moves along a straight line not

significantly pushed the boundary of scene representation learning. Aiming to
boost the computation efficiency and rendering quality of 3D scenes, a popular
line of research maps the 3D coordinate system to another measuring system,
e.g., 2D manifolds and hash tables, for modeling neural fields. The conversion
of coordinate systems can be typically dubbed as gauge transformation, which is
usually a pre-defined mapping function, e.g., orthogonal projection or spatial

transformation along with the neural field in an end-to-end manner? In this
work, we extend this problem to a general paradigm with a taxonomy of discrete

optimize the gauge transformation and neural fields. To counter the problem
that the learning of gauge transformations can collapse easily, we derive a
general regularization mechanism from the principle of information conservation
during the gauge transformation. To circumvent the high computation cost in
gauge learning with regularization, we directly derive an information-invariant
gauge transformation which allows to preserve scene information inherently and

considers this need as a bi-objective online load balancing problem. A neural
network based scalable policy is designed to route user requests to varied

Extensive simulations help reveal the detailed applicability of the proposed

replaces interaction times between nodes by independent Poisson processes,
allowing for tractability in several cases, such as intensity-based models from

The state of each node, described by the stochastic intensity of an associated
point process, aggregates arrivals from its neighbors and is fragmented upon
departure. We consider the replica-mean-field version of such a process, which

been developed recently. However, existing GAN-based GS methods cannot
completely recover the hidden secret data due to the lack of network
invertibility, while Flow-based methods produce poor image quality due to the
stringent reversibility restriction in each module. To address this issue, we
propose a novel GS scheme called ""Generative Steganography Diffusion"" (GSD) by
devising an invertible diffusion model named ""StegoDiffusion"". It not only
generates realistic stego images but also allows for 100\% recovery of the
hidden secret data. The proposed StegoDiffusion model leverages a non-Markov
chain with a fast sampling technique to achieve efficient stego image
generation. By constructing an ordinary differential equation (ODE) based on
the transition probability of the generation process in StegoDiffusion, secret
data and stego images can be converted to each other through the approximate
solver of ODE -- Euler iteration formula, enabling the use of irreversible but
more expressive network structures to achieve model invertibility. Our proposed
GSD has the advantages of both reversibility and high performance,

understanding its manipulation and transformation remains a challenge. Many
tasks rely on highly entangled pure states, but obtaining such states is often
challenging due to the presence of noise. Typically, entanglement manipulation
procedures involving asymptotically many copies of a state are considered to
overcome this problem. These procedures allow for distilling highly entangled
pure states from noisy states, which enables a wide range of applications, such
as quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. When it comes to
manipulating entangled quantum systems on a single copy level, using entangled
states as catalysts can significantly broaden the range of achievable
transformations. Similar to the concept of catalysis in chemistry, the
entangled catalyst is returned unchanged at the end of the state manipulation
procedure. Our results demonstrate that despite the apparent conceptual
differences between the asymptotic and catalytic settings, they are actually
strongly connected and fully equivalent for all distillable states. Our methods
rely on the analysis of many-copy entanglement manipulation procedures which
may establish correlations between different copies. As an important
consequence, we demonstrate that using an entangled catalyst cannot enhance the
asymptotic singlet distillation rate of a distillable quantum state. Our
findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and

notably the existence of bound entangled (undistillable) states. Here we

catalytic transformations can never allow for the distillation of entanglement
from a bound entangled state, even if the catalyst may become correlated with
the system of interest, and even under permissive choices of free operations.
This precludes the possibility that catalysis can make entanglement theory
asymptotically reversible. Our methods are based on new asymptotic bounds for
the distillable entanglement and entanglement cost assisted by correlated

with a phase of ultra slow-roll (USR) tailor suited to generate an order-one
abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). More in detail, we impose the
condition that loop corrections made up of short-wavelength modes enhanced by
the USR dynamics do not alter the tree-level power spectrum of curvature
perturbations. In our analysis, the USR phase is preceded and followed by two
stages of ordinary slow-roll (SR), and we model the resulting SR/USR/SR
dynamics using both instantaneous and smooth transitions. Focusing on scales
relevant for CMB observations, we find that it is not possible, with these
arguments, to rule out the scenario of PBH formation via USR, not even in the
limit of instantaneous transition. However, we also find that loop corrections
of short modes on the power spectrum of long modes, even though not large
enough to violate perturbativity requirements, remain appreciable and, most
importantly, are not tamed in realistic realisations of smooth SR/USR/SR
transitions. This makes perturbativity a powerful theoretical tool to constrain
USR dynamics. We extend the analysis at any scale beyond those relevant for CMB
observations. We find that loop corrections of short modes remain within the
few percent if compared to the tree-level power spectrum. However, we also find
one notable exception of phenomenological relevance: we show that the so-called
dip in the power spectrum of curvature perturbation is an artifact of the
tree-level computation.

correlated with radial velocity (RV) variations caused by solar surface
activity. This activity indicator is therefore a prime candidate to unlock the
potential of RV surveys to discover Earth twins orbiting Sun-like stars. We
show for the first time how a precise proxy of the unsigned magnetic flux
($\Delta\alpha B^2$) can be obtained from Sun-as-a-star intensity spectra by
harnessing the magnetic information contained in over 4000 absorption lines in
the wavelength range from 380 to 690 nm. This novel activity proxy can thus be
obtained from the same spectra from which RVs are routinely extracted. We
derived $\Delta\alpha B^2$ from 500 randomly selected spectra from the HARPS-N
public solar data set, which spans from 2015 to 2018. We compared our estimates
with the unsigned magnetic flux values from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) finding excellent agreement (median absolute deviation: 4.9 per cent).
The extracted indicator $\Delta\alpha B^2$ correlates with SDO's unsigned
magnetic flux estimates on the solar rotational timescale (Pearson correlation
coefficient 0.67) and on the three-year timescale of our data set (correlation
coefficient 0.91). We find correlations of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the HARPS-N
solar RV variations of 0.49 on the rotational timescale and 0.78 on the
three-year timescale. The Pearson correlation of $\Delta\alpha B^2$ with the
RVs is found to be greater than the correlation of the classical activity
indicators with the RVs. For solar-type stars, $\Delta\alpha B^2$ therefore
represents the best simultaneous activity proxy known to date.

harvesting (EH) at the RX, the received optical signal is first converted to an
electrical signal, and then, its alternating current (AC) and direct current
(DC) components are separated and utilized for information decoding and EH,
respectively. By accurately analysing the equivalent electrical circuit of the
photovoltaic RX, we model the current flow through the photovoltaic p-n
junction in both the low and high input power regimes using a two-diode model
of the p-n junction and we derive a closed-form non-linear EH model that
characterizes the harvested power at the RX. Furthermore, taking into account
the non-linear behaviour of the photovoltaic RX on information reception, we
derive the optimal distribution of the transmit information signal that
maximizes the achievable information rate. The proposed EH model is validated
by circuit simulation results. Furthermore, we compare with two baseline models
based on maximum power point (MPP) tracking at the RX and a single-diode p-n

EH model, they are not able to fully capture the non-linearity of photovoltaic

shock-induced aerobreakup of a liquid metal droplet in a high Weber number
regime (We ~ 400 - 8000). Atomization dynamics is examined for three test
environments: oxidizing (Galinstan-air), inert (Galinstan-nitrogen), and
conventional fluids (DI water-air). Due to the readily oxidizing nature of
liquid metals, their atomization in an industrial scale system is generally
carried in inert atmosphere conditions. However, no previous study has
considered gas-induced secondary atomization of liquid metals in inert
conditions. Due to experimental challenges associated with molten metals,
laboratory scale models are generally tested for conventional fluids like DI
water, liquid fuels, etc. The translation of results obtained from conventional
fluid to liquid metal atomization is rarely explored. Here a direct multi-scale
spatial and temporal comparison is provided between the atomization dynamics of
conventional fluid and liquid metals under oxidizing and inert conditions. The
liquid metal droplet undergoes breakup through Shear-Induced Entrainment (SIE)
mode for the studied range of Weber number values. The prevailing mechanism is
explained based on the relative dominance of droplet deformation and KH wave
formation. The study provides quantitative and qualitative similarities for the
three test cases and explains the differences in morphology of fragmenting
secondary droplets in the oxidizing test case (Galinstan-air) due to rapid
oxidation of the fragmenting ligaments. A phenomenological framework is
postulated for predicting the morphology of secondary droplets. The formation
of flake-like secondary droplets in the Galinstan air test case is based on the
oxidation rate of liquid metals and the properties of the oxide layer formed on
the atomizing ligament surface.

can prevent overfitting by introducing noise to the input data, encouraging the
model to learn more generalized features. Despite its success in various
applications, there has been a lack of systematic study on the regularization
ability of random smoothing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by
presenting a framework for random smoothing regularization that can adaptively
and effectively learn a wide range of ground truth functions belonging to the
classical Sobolev spaces. Specifically, we investigate two underlying function
spaces: the Sobolev space of low intrinsic dimension, which includes the
Sobolev space in $D$-dimensional Euclidean space or low-dimensional
sub-manifolds as special cases, and the mixed smooth Sobolev space with a
tensor structure. By using random smoothing regularization as novel
convolution-based smoothing kernels, we can attain optimal convergence rates in
these cases using a kernel gradient descent algorithm, either with early
stopping or weight decay. It is noteworthy that our estimator can adapt to the
structural assumptions of the underlying data and avoid the curse of
dimensionality. This is achieved through various choices of injected noise
distributions such as Gaussian, Laplace, or general polynomial noises, allowing
for broad adaptation to the aforementioned structural assumptions of the
underlying data. The convergence rate depends only on the effective dimension,
which may be significantly smaller than the actual data dimension. We conduct
numerical experiments on simulated data to validate our theoretical results.

modulation at the transmitter (TX) and a resonant tunnelling diode (RTD)- based
EH circuit at the receiver (RX) to extract both information and power from the
received signal. However, the electrical properties of Schottky diodes and RTDs
are different, and unlike EH receivers based on a single Schottky diode, an
accurate closed-form EH model for RTD-based RXs is not available, yet. In this
paper, we model the dependency of the instantaneous RX output power on the
instantaneous received power by a non-linear piecewise function, whose
parameters are adjusted to fit circuit simulation results. We formulate an
optimization problem to maximize the mutual information between the TX and RX
signals subject to constraints on the peak amplitude of the transmitted signal
and the required average harvested power at the RX. Furthermore, we determine a
feasibility condition for the formulated problem, and for high and low required
average harvested powers, we derive the achievable information rate numerically

between the information rate and the average harvested power. Finally, we show
that this tradeoff is determined by the peak amplitude of the transmitted
signal and the maximum instantaneous harvested power for low and high received
signal powers, respectively.

protect privacy. We aim to improve the learning performance by jointly
designing the device scheduling, alignment coefficient, and the number of

DP-OTA-FedAvg in the cases of convex and non-convex loss functions. Based on
these analytical results, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the

the number of communication rounds, we conclude the relationship between the
number of scheduled devices and the alignment coefficient, which offers a set
of potential optimal solution pairs of device scheduling and the alignment
coefficient. Thanks to the reduced search space, the optimal solution can be
efficiently obtained. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated

contexts to model the evolution of uncertain dynamical systems. In recent
years, their applications to geophysical fluid dynamics has increased
massively. For a judicious usage in modelling fluid evolution, one needs to
calibrate the amplitude of the noise to data. In this paper we address this
requirement for the stochastic rotating shallow water (SRSW) model. This work
is a continuation of [LvLCP23], where a data assimilation methodology has been
introduced for the SRSW model. The noise used in [LvLCP23] was introduced as an
arbitrary random phase shift in the Fourier space. This is not necessarily
consistent with the uncertainty induced by a model reduction procedure. In this
paper, we introduce a new method of noise calibration of the SRSW model which
is compatible with the model reduction technique. The method is generic and can
be applied to arbitrary stochastic parametrizations. It is also agnostic as to
the source of data (real or synthetic). It is based on a principal component
analysis technique to generate the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the
covariance matrix of the stochastic parametrization. For SRSW model covered in
this paper, we calibrate the noise by using the elevation variable of the
model, as this is an observable easily obtainable in practical application, and
use synthetic data as input for the calibration procedure.

functional influences the specifics of the electronic structure, we observe a
similar trend with increasing Fe concentration in both LDA and GGA

substitution, the lowest-lying conduction band in the minority-spin channel
broadens such that these states keep getting lowered relative to the Fermi
level, which is contrary to the expectations from a rigid band picture.
Furthermore, the exchange splitting decreases as more Co atoms are replaced by
Fe, and this again brings the minority-spin states closer to the Fermi level.
These two mechanisms, in conjunction with the experimental observation that
minority-spin bands cross the Fermi level in stoichiometric CoS$_2$, indicate
that minority-spin charge carriers will always be present in

well-studied. However, an intrinsic property of these kind of systems is that
they can only live on even dimensional manifolds. To introduce a similar notion
of integrability on odd dimensional manifolds, one needs another type of
geometry: contact geometry. These lecture notes, aimed towards graduate
students, serve as an introduction to this form of integrabilty. We will start
by introducing the necessary concepts from contact geometry, which is the
sister geometry of symplectic geometry. In the third chapter, we discuss the
contact Hamiltonian vector field (which is similar to the standard Hamiltonian
vector field) and the Jacobi bracket (which has similar dynamical properties as
the Poisson bracket in the symplectic world). After this, we are able to
introduce contact complete integrability: there exist (at least) two different
notions of such integrability in the literature: one by Khesin & Tabachnikov
(which has a more geometric nature) and one by Jovanovic & Jovanovic. We will
show that both notions coincide. Subsequently, we will give an overview of the
semi-local aspects of contact complete integrability, namely the behaviour of
the dynamics near regular fibres (an Arnold-Liouville-like theorem by
Jovanovic) and singular fibres (a local normal form as described by Miranda).
Finally, we will introduce contact toric G-manifolds, which where classified by
Lerman in 2003 (similar to the Delzant-classification of toric integrable
systems). Throughout these notes, we will focus on the link with integrable
Hamiltonian systems in symplectic geometry.

remarkable success with the deep learning methods in recent years.
Nevertheless, we observe that several important issues largely remain open. On
the one hand, graph clustering from the geometric perspective is appealing but
has rarely been touched before, as it lacks a promising space for geometric
clustering. On the other hand, contrastive learning boosts the deep graph
clustering but usually struggles in either graph augmentation or hard sample
mining. To bridge this gap, we rethink the problem of graph clustering from
geometric perspective and, to the best of our knowledge, make the first attempt
to introduce a heterogeneous curvature space to graph clustering problem.
Correspondingly, we present a novel end-to-end contrastive graph clustering
model named CONGREGATE, addressing geometric graph clustering with Ricci
curvatures. To support geometric clustering, we construct a theoretically
grounded Heterogeneous Curvature Space where deep representations are generated
via the product of the proposed fully Riemannian graph convolutional nets.
Thereafter, we train the graph clusters by an augmentation-free reweighted
contrastive approach where we pay more attention to both hard negatives and
hard positives in our curvature space. Empirical results on real-world graphs

be detected. While short-period binaries are detectable due to a clear signal
in the pulsar's timing residuals, effects from a long-period binary could be
masked by other timing effects, allowing them to go undetected. In particular,
a long-period binary measured over a small subset of its orbital period could
manifest via time derivatives of the spin-frequency incompatible with isolated
pulsar properties. We assess the possibility of pulsars having unknown
companions in long-period binaries and put constraints on the range of binary
properties that may remain undetected in current data, but that may be
detectable with further observations. We find that for 35% of canonical pulsars
with published higher order derivatives, the precision of measurements is not
enough to confidently reject binarity (period greater than ~2 kyr), and that a
black-hole binary companion could not be ruled out for a sample of pulsars
without published constraints if the period is greater than 1 kyr. While we
find no convincing cases in the literature, we put more stringent limits on
orbital period and longitude of periastron for the few pulsars with published

  Mixed Traffic: A Game Theoretic Approach",,,,,"cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-density, unsignalized intersection has always been a bottleneck of
efficiency and safety. The emergence of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)
results in a mixed traffic condition, further increasing the complexity of the
transportation system. Against this background, this paper aims to study the
intricate and heterogeneous interaction of vehicles and conflict resolution at
the high-density, mixed, unsignalized intersection. Theoretical insights about
the interaction between CAVs and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) and the
cooperation of CAVs are synthesized, based on which a novel cooperative
decision-making framework in heterogeneous mixed traffic is proposed.
Normalized Cooperative game is concatenated with Level-k game (NCL game) to
generate a system optimal solution. Then Lattice planner generates the optimal
and collision-free trajectories for CAVs. To reproduce HVs in mixed traffic,
interactions from naturalistic human driving data are extracted as prior
knowledge. Non-cooperative game and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) are
integrated to mimic the decision making of heterogeneous HVs. Finally, three
cases are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm,
including the comparative analysis with different methods, the case study under
different Rates of Penetration (ROP) and the interaction analysis with
heterogeneous HVs. It is found that the proposed cooperative decision-making
framework is beneficial to the driving conflict resolution and the traffic
efficiency improvement of the mixed unsignalized intersection. Besides, due to
the consideration of driving heterogeneity, better human-machine interaction
and cooperation can be realized in this paper.

induce an idling point between resonant resonators, and its state-dependent

The advantage of this scheme over previous one is demonstrated through the
generation of high-fidelity NOON states between the resonators, with a lower

a field that exemplifies this need, as regulators require diverse and often

especially given the challenges of dealing with missing values and identifying

  To address these challenges, we propose a variant of Lloyd's algorithm that
applies to probability distributions and uses generalized Wasserstein
barycenters to construct a metric space which represents given data on various

and [Z. Biro and J. J. L. Velazquez, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2000]) is one where
the pressure within the gas bubble is spatially uniform and satisfies an ideal
gas law, relating the pressure, density and temperature of the gas. The
temperature of the surrounding liquid is taken to be constant and the behavior
of the liquid pressure at infinity is prescribed to be constant or periodic in
time. In arXiv:2207.04079, for the case where the liquid pressure at infinity
is a positive constant, we proved the existence of a one-parameter manifold of
spherical equilibria, parameterized by the bubble mass, and further proved that
it is a nonlinearly and exponentially asymptotically stable center manifold.
  In the present article, we first refine the exponential time-decay estimates,
via a study of the linearized dynamics subject to the constraint of fixed mass.
We obtain, in particular, estimates for the exponential decay rate constant,
which highlight the interplay between the effects of thermal diffusivity and
the liquid viscosity.
  We then study the nonlinear radial dynamics of the bubble-fluid system
subject to a pressure field at infinity which is a small-amplitude and
time-periodic perturbation about a positive constant. We prove that nonlinearly
and exponentially asymptotically stable time-periodically pulsating solutions
of the nonlinear (asymptotic) model exist for all sufficiently small forcing
amplitudes. The existence of such states is formulated as a fixed point problem
for the Poincar\'e return map, and the existence of a fixed point makes use of
our (constant mass constrained) exponential time-decay estimates of the

between the modalities from those that are specific to each modality. A static
latent variable is also introduced to encode the information that is constant
over time within an audiovisual speech sequence. The model is trained in an
unsupervised manner on an audiovisual emotional speech dataset, in two stages.
In the first stage, a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) is learned independently
for each modality, without temporal modeling. The second stage consists in
learning the MDVAE model on the intermediate representation of the VQ-VAEs
before quantization. The disentanglement between static versus dynamical and
modality-specific versus modality-common information occurs during this second
training stage. Extensive experiments are conducted to investigate how
audiovisual speech latent factors are encoded in the latent space of MDVAE.
These experiments include manipulating audiovisual speech, audiovisual facial

that MDVAE effectively combines the audio and visual information in its latent

complexity of sub-word tokenization or beam search decoding, resulting in the
decision to deploy a closed-vocabulary language model. However,
closed-vocabulary models are unable to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words
belonging to specific users. To address this issue, We propose a novel
technique called ""OOV expansion"" that improves OOV coverage and increases model
accuracy while minimizing the impact on memory and latency. This method
introduces a personalized ""OOV adapter"" that effectively transfers knowledge
from a central model and learns word embedding for personalized vocabulary. OOV
expansion significantly outperforms standard FL personalization methods on a
set of common FL benchmarks.

bulky tabletop-sized free-space optical systems, preventing advanced photonic
applications such as rapid-time-scale experiments. Here, device miniaturization
into photonic integrated circuits (PICs) with maintained optical capabilities
is key to revolutionize mid-IR photonics. Sub-wavelength mode confinement in
plasmonic structures enabled such miniaturization approaches in the

needs suitable low-loss and -dispersion materials with compatible integration
strategies to existing mid-IR technology. In this work we further unlock the
field of LWIR/mid-IR PICs, by combining photolithographic patterning of organic
polymers with dielectric-loaded surface plasmon polariton (DLSPP) waveguides.
In particular, polyethylene shows favorable optical properties, including low
refractive index and broad transparency between ~2-200 um. We investigate the
whole value chain, including design, fabrication, and characterization of
polyethylene-based DLSPP waveguides and demonstrate their first-time plasmonic
operation and mode guiding capabilities along s-bend structures. Low bending
losses of ~1.3 dB and straight-section propagation lengths of ~1 mm, pave the
way for unprecedented, complex on-chip mid-IR photonic devices. Moreover,
DLSPPs allow full control of the mode parameters (propagation length and
guiding capabilities) for precisely addressing advanced sensing and

in magnetic confinement devices. While a large number of studies show that
flux-tube codes provide an excellent approximation for turbulent transport in
medium-large devices, it still needs to be determined whether they are
sufficient for modeling supra-thermal particle effects on core turbulence. This
is called into question given the large temperature of energetic particles
(EPs), which makes them hardly confined on a single flux-surface, but also due
to the radially broad mode structure of energetic-particle-driven modes. The
primary focus of this manuscript is to assess the range of validity of
flux-tube codes in modeling fast ion effects by comparing radially global
turbulence simulations with flux-tube results at different radial locations for
realistic JET parameters using the gyrokinetic code GENE. To extend our study
to a broad range of different plasma scenarios, this comparison is made for
four different plasma regimes, which differ only by the profile of the ratio
between the plasma kinetic and magnetic pressure. The latter is artificially
rescaled to address the electrostatic limit and regimes with marginally stable,
weakly unstable and strongly unstable fast ion modes. These
energetic-particle-driven modes is identified as an AITG/KBAE via linear ORB5
and LIGKA simulations. It is found that the local flux-tube simulations can
recover well the global results only in the electrostatic and marginally stable
cases. When the AITG/KBAE becomes linearly unstable, the local approximation
fails to correctly model the radially broad fast ion mode structure and the
consequent global zonal patterns. According to this study, global turbulence
simulations are likely required in regimes with linearly unstable AITG/KBAEs.
In conditions with different fast ion-driven modes, these results might change.

there are still fundamental limitations of current CBFs: optimality, stability,

remains solving a single-step convex quadratic program. Our method is evaluated
on the first and second-order systems in various scenarios, where our approach

hardness and can be characterized through feature, structural, instance, and
multiresolution overlap; (3) no universal preprocessing technique is applicable

fortunately, dataset complexity measures can help identify suitable techniques
for specific datasets; (4) integrating data complexity information into the

Photoproduction of vector mesons (e.g. J/$\psi$ and $\psi$') in UPC is quite

carry out differential measurements, such as the measurement of the

at test time is an important research problem. Unfortunately, prior work
established that this problem is NP-hard for decision tree ensembles, hence
bound to be intractable for specific inputs. In this paper, we identify a
restricted class of decision tree ensembles, called large-spread ensembles,
which admit a security verification algorithm running in polynomial time. We
then propose a new approach called verifiable learning, which advocates the
training of such restricted model classes which are amenable for efficient
verification. We show the benefits of this idea by designing a new training
algorithm that automatically learns a large-spread decision tree ensemble from
labelled data, thus enabling its security verification in polynomial time.
Experimental results on publicly available datasets confirm that large-spread
ensembles trained using our algorithm can be verified in a matter of seconds,
using standard commercial hardware. Moreover, large-spread ensembles are more
robust than traditional ensembles against evasion attacks, while incurring in
just a relatively small loss of accuracy in the non-adversarial setting.

predicted to have a barrier of at least several eV, which is much higher than

decrease rapidly down to <1 eV with increasing ripples' curvature. The
estimated hydrogen permeation rates by fully considering the distribution of

that at least 30 nm of capping material is necessary to protect the material
from Sulfur loss. However, adding this cap affects the crystallization
temperatures of the two PCMs in different ways. The crystallization temperature
of $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ and Ag-doped $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ increased and decreased
respectively, which is attributed to interfacial energy differences. Capped and
uncapped Ag-doped $Sb_{2}S_{3}$ microring resonator (MRR) devices were
fabricated and measured to understand how the cap affects the device
performance. Surprisingly, the resonant frequency of the MRR exhibited a larger
red-shift upon crystallization for the capped PCMs. This effect was due to the
cap increasing the modal overlap with the PCM layer. Caps can, therefore, be
used to provide a greater optical phase shift per unit length, thus reducing
the overall footprint of these programmable devices. Overall, we conclude that
caps on PCMs are not just useful for stabilizing the PCM layer, but can also be
used to tune the PCM crystallization temperature and reduce device footprint.
Moreover, the capping layer can be exploited to enhance light-matter
interactions with the PCM element.

using two strategies. 1) Identifying the metal in the RayStation treatment
planning software (TPS) using image window level adjustments, delineate a
contour enclosing the artifact, and setting the density of the surrounding
voxels to unity (RS1). 2) Registering a geometry template with dimensions and
materials from the TTEs (RS2). Both strategies were compared for DermaSpan,
AlloX2, and AlloX2-Pro TTEs using Collapsed-Cone-Convolution (CCC) in
RayStation TPS, Monte Carlo simulations (MC) using TOPAS, and films. Wax slab
phantoms with TTEs and breast phantoms with TTEs balloons were made and
irradiated with a 6 MV AP beam and partial arc, respectively. Results: For the
wax slab phantoms, the dose differences between RS1 and RS2 were 0.5% for
DermaSpan and AlloX2 but 3% for AlloX2-Pro. From TOPAS simulations of RS2, the
impact in dose distributions caused by the magnet attenuation was (6.4+-0.4)%,
(4.9+-0.7)%, and (2.0+-0.9)% for DermaSpan, AlloX2, and AlloX2-Pro. With breast
phantoms, maximum differences in DVH parameters between RS1 and RS2 were as
follows. For AlloX2 at the posterior region: (2.1+-1.0)%, (1.9+-1.0)% and
(1.4+-1.0)% for D1, D10, and average dose, respectively. For AlloX2-Pro at the
anterior region (-1.0+-1.0)%, (-0.6+-1.0)% and (-0.6+-1.0)% for D1, D10 and
average dose, respectively. The impact in D10 caused by the magnet was at most
(5.5+-1.0)% and (-0.8+-1.0)% for AlloX2 and AlloX2-Pro, respectively.
Conclusion: This study showed that the highest differences with respect to

polaronic oxygen vacancy defect (Vo) density and gas sensor response of 1 at%
Mo doped $V_2O_5$ (MVONW) nanowires. Doping 1 at% $Mo^{5+}$ leads to
substitution at the $V^{5+}$ site in $V_2O_5$ nanowires (VONW) and thereby
reduction in Vo defects. This in turn affects the charge carrier hopping sites
and subsequently enhances the sensor response at lower temperatures
($<320^oC$). The $Mo^{5+}$ dopants lead to the lowering of Fermi energy (EF)
towards valence band maxima due to reduced $V_o$ donor density. The polaron
suppression is confirmed with activation energy of polaron hopping, increasing
from 195 meV to 385 meV in VONW and MVONW respectively. As a result, the
response to ethanol gas enhanced as the depletion width is widened for the
given cross-section of the nanowires. This may lead to large depletion
controlled cross-sectional area and thereby better sensitivity. At about
$350^oC$ VONW show change in slope of resistance vs temperature (MIT) which is
not observed in case of MVONW. This is attributed to presence of enhanced
non-stoichiometry of V ion resulting in metallic behaviour and accompanied with
sudden rise in sensor response at this temperature. Moreover, the absence of
MIT may be attributed to lack of such sudden rise in response in MVONW.

autocurricular training with physically grounded problems, such as robust
control and interactive manipulation tasks. However, the asymmetric nature of
these tasks makes the generation of sophisticated policies challenging. Indeed,
the asymmetry in the environment may implicitly or explicitly provide an
advantage to a subset of agents which could, in turn, lead to a low-quality
equilibrium. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretic algorithm, Stackelberg
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ST-MADDPG), which formulates a
two-player MARL problem as a Stackelberg game with one player as the `leader'
and the other as the `follower' in a hierarchical interaction structure wherein
the leader has an advantage. We first demonstrate that the leader's advantage
from ST-MADDPG can be used to alleviate the inherent asymmetry in the
environment. By exploiting the leader's advantage, ST-MADDPG improves the
quality of a co-evolution process and results in more sophisticated and complex
strategies that work well even against an unseen strong opponent.

  Contrastive Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Attribute graphs are ubiquitous in multimedia applications, and graph
representation learning (GRL) has been successful in analyzing attribute graph
data. However, incomplete graph data and missing node attributes can have a
negative impact on media knowledge discovery. Existing methods for handling
attribute missing graph have limited assumptions or fail to capture complex
attribute-graph dependencies. To address these challenges, we propose Attribute
missing Graph Contrastive Learning (AmGCL), a framework for handling missing
node attributes in attribute graph data. AmGCL leverages Dirichlet energy
minimization-based feature precoding to encode in missing attributes and a
self-supervised Graph Augmentation Contrastive Learning Structure (GACLS) to
learn latent variables from the encoded-in data. Specifically, AmGCL utilizies
feature reconstruction based on structure-attribute energy minimization while
maximizes the lower bound of evidence for latent representation mutual
information. Our experimental results on multiple real-world datasets
demonstrate that AmGCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both feature
imputation and node classification tasks, indicating the effectiveness of our
proposed method in real-world attribute graph analysis tasks.

locomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as
mobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action
space of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,
efficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often
segregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary
manipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space
to MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. base actions for locomotion objectives and arm
actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous combinations of
locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires human domain
knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the action parts
to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a new framework
to train policies for typical MoMa tasks that makes use of the most favorable
subspace of the robot's action space to address each sub-objective. Causal MoMa
automatically discovers the causal dependencies between actions and terms of
the reward function and exploits these dependencies in a causal policy learning
procedure that reduces gradient variance compared to previous state-of-the-art
policy gradient algorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the
performance of Causal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different
MoMa tasks and demonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in
simulation directly to a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving
goals and react to dynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically
controlling the whole-body: base, arm, and head. More information at

functional data-oriented, feature-driven, and convolution kernel-based methods.
Recent studies have shown using convolution kernel-based methods like ROCKET,

detection of gait characteristics in patients and typically developing peers.
Our system remotely and in real-time collects data from device sensors (e.g.,
acceleration from a mobile device, etc.) using our novel Walk4Me API. Our web
application extracts temporal/spatial gait characteristics and raw data signal
characteristics and then employs traditional machine learning and deep learning
techniques to identify patterns that can 1) identify patients with gait
disturbances associated with disease, 2) describe the degree of mobility
limitation, and 3) identify characteristics that change over time with disease
progression. We have identified several machine learning techniques that
differentiate between patients and typically-developing subjects with 100%
accuracy across the age range studied, and we have also identified
corresponding temporal/spatial gait characteristics associated with each group.
Our work demonstrates the potential of utilizing the latest advances in mobile

answering questions from unseen domain or any out-of-domain distributions

all the existing QA domain adaptation methods are either based on generating
synthetic data or pseudo labeling the target domain data. The domain adaptation
methods based on synthetic data and pseudo labeling suffers either from the
requirement of computational resources or an extra overhead of carefully
selecting the confidence threshold to separate the noisy examples from being in
the training dataset. In this paper, we propose the unsupervised domain
adaptation for unlabeled target domain by transferring the target
representation near to source domain while still using the supervision from
source domain. Towards that we proposed the idea of domain invariant fine
tuning along with adversarial label correction to identify the target instances
which lie far apart from the source domain, so that the feature encoder can be
learnt to minimize the distance between such target instances and source
instances class wisely, removing the possibility of learning the features of
target domain which are still near to source support but are ambiguous.
Evaluation of our QA domain adaptation method namely, DomainInv on multiple

Moreover, rather than treating the subgraph as a sequence we exploit its
underlying structure, and thus encode it using a graph neural network which
further allows us to represent a large number of (unseen) nodes. Experimental
results show that modeling context dynamically is superior to static
approaches, delivering performance improvements across the board (i.e., for

handling ellipsis and resolving coreference) and longer interactions.

structures, especially when generating large molecules. Fragment-based molecule
generation is a promising strategy, however, it is nontrivial to be adapted for
3D non-autoregressive generations because of the combinational optimization
problems. In this paper, we utilize a coarse-to-fine strategy to tackle this
problem, in which a Hierarchical Diffusion-based model (i.e.~HierDiff) is
proposed to preserve the validity of local segments without relying on
autoregressive modeling. Specifically, HierDiff first generates coarse-grained
molecule geometries via an equivariant diffusion process, where each
coarse-grained node reflects a fragment in a molecule. Then the coarse-grained
nodes are decoded into fine-grained fragments by a message-passing process and
a newly designed iterative refined sampling module. Lastly, the fine-grained
fragments are then assembled to derive a complete atomic molecular structure.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that HierDiff consistently improves the

magnetoelectric, magneto-optic and spintronic devices. In spintronics,
particularly in spincaloritronic applications, low thermal conductivity
($\kappa$) is highly desired. Here, by combining thermal transport measurements
with density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate low $\kappa$ down
to 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ in a typical vdW ferromagnet Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$. In
the paramagnetic state, development of magnetic fluctuations way above
$T_\mathrm{c}=$ 33 K strongly reduces $\kappa$ via spin-phonon scattering,
leading to low $\kappa \sim$ 1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$ over a wide temperature
range, in comparable to that of amorphous silica. In the magnetically ordered
state, emergence of resonant magnon-phonon scattering limits $\kappa$ below
$\sim$ 2 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$, which would be three times larger if magnetic
scatterings were absent. Application of magnetic fields strongly suppresses the
spin-phonon scattering, giving rise to large enhancements of $\kappa$. Our
calculations well capture these complex behaviours of $\kappa$ by taking the
temperature- and magnetic-field-dependent spin-phonon scattering into account.
Realization of low $\kappa$ which is easily tunable by magnetic fields in
Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, may further promote spincaloritronic applications of vdW
magnets. Our theoretical approach may also provide a generic understanding of
spin-phonon scattering, which appears to play important roles in various

presented for noncontinuous piecewise linear functions and for tropical
hypersurfaces without requiring a growth condition. The method of proof is
novel and significantly more straightforward than previously known proofs. The
tropical analogue of the Nevanlinna inverse problem is formulated and solved
for tropical meromorphic functions and tropical hypersurfaces.

and is frequently used as the primary form of communication by people with
hearing loss. Even so, not many people with hearing loss use sign language, and
they frequently experience social isolation. Therefore, it is necessary to
create human-computer interface systems that can offer hearing-impaired people
a social platform. Most commercial sign language translation systems now on the
market are sensor-based, pricey, and challenging to use. Although vision-based
systems are desperately needed, they must first overcome several challenges.
Earlier continuous sign language recognition techniques used hidden Markov
models, which have a limited ability to include temporal information. To get
over these restrictions, several machine learning approaches are being applied
to transform hand and sign language motions into spoken or written language. In
this study, we compare various deep learning techniques for recognising sign
language. Our survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most
recent approaches and challenges in this field.

author's 70th birthday. It presents his lifelong endeavors and reflections with
original reasoning and re-interpretations of the most critical and misleading
issues in thermodynamics; since now, we have the advantage to look at the
historical developments more comprehensively and objectively than the pioneers.
Starting from Carnot (grandfather of thermodynamics-to-be) to Kelvin and
Clausius (fathers of thermodynamics), and other followers, the most relevant
issues are critically examined and put in historical and contemporary
perspective. From original reasoning of energy forcing and displacement to
logical proofs of the fundamental laws, to ubiquity of thermal motion and heat,
and indestructibility of entropy, including the new concept of ""thermal
roughness"" and the inevitability of dissipative irreversibility, to ""dissecting
Carnot true reversible-equivalency"" and critical concept of ""Carnot-Clausius
heat-work equivalency (CCHWE)"" regarding the interchangeability of heat and
work, and to demonstrating ""no hope"" for the ""challengers"" of the Second Law of
thermodynamics, among others, are offered. It is hoped that the novel
contributions presented will enhance comprehension and resolve some of the
fundamental issues, as well as promote collaboration and future progress.

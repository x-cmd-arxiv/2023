practice, which significantly enhances the productivity of software developers.
To find desired code snippets, developers resort to code search engines through
natural language queries. Neural code search models are hence behind many such
engines. These models are based on deep learning and gain substantial attention
due to their impressive performance. However, the security aspect of these
models is rarely studied. Particularly, an adversary can inject a backdoor in
neural code search models, which return buggy or even vulnerable code with
security/privacy issues. This may impact the downstream software (e.g., stock
trading systems and autonomous driving) and cause financial loss and/or
life-threatening incidents. In this paper, we demonstrate such attacks are
feasible and can be quite stealthy. By simply modifying one variable/function
name, the attacker can make buggy/vulnerable code rank in the top 11%. Our
attack BADCODE features a special trigger generation and injection procedure,
making the attack more effective and stealthy. The evaluation is conducted on
two neural code search models and the results show our attack outperforms
baselines by 60%. Our user study demonstrates that our attack is more stealthy
than the baseline by two times based on the F1 score.

can we balance the trade-off between homogeneity within the cluster and
information gain through borrowing? (2) How can we determine the borrowing
strength dynamically in different clusters? To tackle challenges, first, we
develop a theoretical framework for heterogeneity identification and dynamic

the overlapping clustering index (OCI) for identifying the optimal clustering
result and the overlapping borrowing index (OBI) for assigning proper borrowing
strength to clusters. By incorporating these indices, we develop a new method
BHMOI (Bayesian hierarchical model with overlapping indices). BHMOI includes a
novel weighted K-Means clustering algorithm by maximizing OCI to obtain optimal
clustering results, and embedding OBI into BHM for dynamically borrowing within
clusters. BHMOI can achieve efficient and robust information borrowing with
desirable properties. Examples and simulation studies are provided to

robustness. A strategy in this direction is adding frustration to topological
systems. In this paper we consider a frustrated toric code on a kagome lattice,
and show that although increasing the strength of perturbation reduces the
topological order of the system, it cannot destroy it completely. Our
frustrated toric code is indeed a quantum loop gas model with string tension
and pressure which their competition leads to a partially topological phase
(PTP) in which the excitations are restricted to move in particular
sublattices. In this phase the ground state is a product of many copies of
fluctuating loop states corresponding to quasi one dimensional ladders. By
defining a non-local matrix order parameter and studying the behavior of ground

reminiscent of fracton codes with restricted mobility, and therefore our
results propose an alternative way for making such a restriction in three

defending against adversarial perturbations. A recent work by Tram\`er showed
that, in the rejection-only case (no transduction), a strong rejection-solution
can be turned into a strong (but computationally inefficient) non-rejection
solution. This detector-to-classifier reduction has been mostly applied to give
evidence that certain claims of strong selective-model solutions are
susceptible, leaving the benefits of rejection unclear. On the other hand, a
recent work by Goldwasser et al. showed that rejection combined with
transduction can give provable guarantees (for certain problems) that cannot be
achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, under recent strong adversarial attacks
(GMSA, which has been shown to be much more effective than AutoAttack against
transduction), Goldwasser et al.'s work was shown to have low performance in a
practical deep-learning setting. In this paper, we take a step towards
realizing the promise of transduction+rejection in more realistic scenarios.
Theoretically, we show that a novel application of Tram\`er's
classifier-to-detector technique in the transductive setting can give
significantly improved sample-complexity for robust generalization. While our
theoretical construction is computationally inefficient, it guides us to
identify an efficient transductive algorithm to learn a selective model.

explains the difference between the voltage hysteresis observed at low currents

transition metal nitride (TMNx) thin films, the effect of N-vacancy
concentration on the elastic properties of cubic TiNx, ZrNx, VNx, NbNx, and
MoNx (0.72<x<1.00) is systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. The predictions are validated experimentally for VNx
(0.77<x<0.97). The DFT results indicate that the elastic behavior of the TMNx
depends on both the N-vacancy concentration and the valence electron
concentration (VEC) of the transition metal: While TiNx and ZrNx exhibit
vacancy-induced reductions in elastic modulus, VNx and NbNx show an increase.
These trends can be rationalized by considering vacancy-induced changes in
elastic anisotropy and bonding. While introduction of N-vacancies in TiNx
results in a significant reduction of elastic modulus along all directions and
a lower average bond strength of Ti-N, the vacancy-induced reduction in [001]
direction of VNx is overcompensated by the higher stiffness along [011] and
[111] directions, resulting in a higher average bond strength of V-N. To
validate the predicted vacancy-induced changes in elasticity experimentally,
close-to-single-crystal VNx (0.77<x<0.97) are grown on MgO(001) substrates. As
the N-content is reduced, the relaxed lattice parameter a0, as probed by X-ray
diffraction, decreases from 4.128 A to 4.096 A. This reduction in lattice
parameter is accompanied by an anomalous 11% increase in elastic modulus, as
determined by nanoindentation. As the experimental data agree with the
predictions, the elasticity enhancement in VNx upon N-vacancy formation can be
understood based on the concomitant changes in elastic anisotropy and bonding.

Recent research has revealed that gradient-descent-based methods exhibit an

self-motility as a means to anneal glasses and use that as a means to fine-tune
the failure mode of the system under uniaxial tensile deformation. We begin by
highlighting the annealing effects of activity and draw parallels with other
well-known mechanical annealing processes, such as oscillatory shearing (both
uni- and multi-directional). Furthermore, we explore the annealing effects in
the presence of open boundaries, observing enhanced surface relaxations due to
activity. By implementing various activity-induced annealing protocols, we
successfully induce a transition in the failure mode from ductile to brittle.
This is demonstrated via performing tensile tests on the glass samples
resulting from the active-annealing process. The intricate effects of geometry
on the formation of shear bands are also examined. We find that samples having
an aspect ratio greater than one fail via shear band formation, owing to their
formation angle of $45\degree$ from the strain axis. In conclusion, we
introduce a novel method for producing well-annealed glasses in silico and

satellites of Saturn. Leveraging the high efficiency of electric propulsion,
the concept enables orbit insertion around each of the moons, for arbitrarily
long close observation periods. The mission starts with a EVVES interplanetary
segment, where a combination of multiple gravity assist and deep space low
thrust enables reduced relative arrival velocity at Saturn. As a result, an
unpowered capture via a sequence of resonant flybys with Titan is possible. The
transfers between moons use a low-thrust control law that connects unstable and
stable branches of the invariant manifolds of planar Lyapunov orbits from the
circular restricted three-body problem of each moon and Saturn. The exploration
of the moons relies on homoclinic and heteroclinic connections of the Lyapunov
orbits around the L$_1$ and L$_2$ equilibrium points. These science orbits can
be extended for arbitrary lengths of time with negligible propellant usage. The
strategy enables a comprehensive scientific exploration of the inner large
moons, located deep inside the gravitational well of Saturn, which is
unfeasible with conventional impulsive maneuvers due to excessive fuel
consumption.

semiquantitatively by considering bulk material properties, the spatial

magnetovolume effect with the short-range magnetic correlations, beginning in
the paramagnetic state well above $T_{\mathrm{N}}$, points to a novel physical
mechanism, which we explain in terms of a trilinear coupling of the elastic
strain with superposed distinct domains of the antiferromagnetic order

short-range magnetic order casts new light on magnetostrictive phenomena and
also provides a template by which the exceptional magnetostrictive properties

statistical analysis unveiled sudden transitions from order to disorder,

approximately half a century in the episodes of disorder, suggesting a
connection with the precession of the orbital plane, due to Earth's oblateness

efficient discrepancy between predicted and target meshes remains an open

approach which measures the discrepancy between two surfaces by comparing two
randomly sampled point-clouds from the two meshes with Chamfer pseudo-distance.
Nevertheless, the set-based approach still has limitations such as lacking a
theoretical guarantee for choosing the number of points in sampled

meshes by using the sliced Wasserstein distance which is an effective optimal
transport distance with linear computational complexity and can provide a fast
statistical rate for approximating the surface of meshes. Furthermore, we
employ a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to deform the input

develop novel stochastic approximations of population-limit SVGD dynamics in
the space of probability measures, which are exactly implementable using a
finite number of particles. Our algorithms can be viewed as specific
random-batch approximations of SVGD, which are computationally more efficient
than ordinary SVGD. We show that the $n$ particles output by VP-SVGD and
GB-SVGD, run for $T$ steps with batch-size $K$, are at-least as good as i.i.d
samples from a distribution whose Kernel Stein Discrepancy to the target is at
most $O\left(\tfrac{d^{1/3}}{(KT)^{1/6}}\right)$ under standard assumptions.

which is much weaker than the isoperimetric (e.g. Poincare Inequality) or
information-transport conditions (e.g. Talagrand's Inequality $\mathsf{T}_1$)
generally considered in prior works. As a corollary, we consider the
convergence of the empirical measure (of the particles output by VP-SVGD and
GB-SVGD) to the target distribution and demonstrate a \emph{double exponential
improvement} over the best known finite-particle analysis of SVGD.

successful interaction as the one changing the visual environment substantially

the desired goal state of the object. In our experiments, we show that our

computer vision tasks, a network of agents, such as a team of robots with
cameras, could work collaboratively to perceive the environment for efficient
and accurate situation awareness. However, these agents often have limited
computation, communication, and storage resources. Thus, reducing resource
consumption while still providing an accurate perception of the environment
becomes an important goal when deploying multi-agent systems. To achieve this
goal, we identify and leverage the overlap among different camera views in
multi-agent systems for reducing the processing, transmission and storage of
redundant/unimportant video frames. Specifically, we have developed two
collaborative multi-agent video fast-forwarding frameworks in distributed and
centralized settings, respectively. In these frameworks, each individual agent
can selectively process or skip video frames at adjustable paces based on
multiple strategies via reinforcement learning. Multiple agents then
collaboratively sense the environment via either 1) a consensus-based
distributed framework called DMVF that periodically updates the fast-forwarding
strategies of agents by establishing communication and consensus among
connected neighbors, or 2) a centralized framework called MFFNet that utilizes
a central controller to decide the fast-forwarding strategies for agents based
on collected data. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed
frameworks on a real-world surveillance video dataset VideoWeb and a new
simulated driving dataset CarlaSim, through extensive simulations and
deployment on an embedded platform with TCP communication. We show that
compared with other approaches in the literature, our frameworks achieve better
coverage of important frames, while significantly reducing the number of frames
processed at each agent.

at which the total demands for goods are matched by the total supplies. Trading
activities that might identify such prices by bringing agents together as
potential buyers and sellers of a good are characteristically absent, however.
Anyway, there is no money to pass from one to the other as ordinarily
envisioned in buying and selling. Here a different approach to equilibrium --
what it should mean and how it may be achieved -- is offered as a constructive
alternative.
  Agents operate in an economic environment where adjustments to holdings have
been needed in the past, will be needed again in a changed future, and money is
familiar for its role in facilitating that. Marginal utility provides relative
values of goods for guidance in making incremental adjustments, and with money
incorporated into utility and taken as num\`eraire, those values give money
price thresholds at which an agent will be willing to buy or sell. Agents in
pairs can then look at such individualized thresholds to see whether a trade of
some amount of a good for some amount of money may be mutually advantageous in
leading to higher levels of utility. Iterative bilateral trades in this most
basic sense, if they keep bringing all goods and agents into play, are
guaranteed in the limit to reach an equilibrium state in which the agents all
agree on prices and, under those prices, have no interest in further adjusting
their holdings. The results of computer simulations are provided to illustrate
how this works.

  Nonetheless we show that Tate modules of Drinfeld modules are ramified in a
limited way: The image of a sufficiently deep ramification subgroup is trivial.
This leads to a new invariant, the local conductor of a Drinfeld module. We
establish an upper bound on the conductor in terms of the volume of the local
period lattice.
  As an intermediate step we develop a theory of normed lattices in function
field arithmetic including the notion of volume. We relate normed lattices to
vector bundles on projective curves. An estimate on Castelnuovo-Mumford
regularity of such bundles gives a volume bound on norms of lattice generators,
and the conductor inequality follows.
  Last but not least we describe the image of inertia for Drinfeld modules of
large stable rank. Just as in the theory of local $\ell$-adic Galois

show that, in the context of linear and deep linear models, KD can be

provide a detailed convergence analysis of the resulting dynamics, which hold
under standard assumptions for both strongly-convex and non-convex losses,
showing that KD acts as a form of \emph{partial variance reduction}, which can
reduce the stochastic gradient noise, but may not eliminate it completely,
depending on the properties of the ``teacher'' model. Our analysis puts further
emphasis on the need for careful parametrization of KD, in particular w.r.t.
the weighting of the distillation loss, and is validated empirically on both
linear models and deep neural networks.

test this assumption with 4 pathology classification tasks on a corpus of 2907

that are the same size but differ in pre-training corpora. Specifically, we
analyze 3 categories of models: 1)General-domain: BERT and Turing Natural

pre-training, 2)Mixed-domain: BioBERT which is obtained from BERT by including
PubMed abstracts in pre-training and Clinical BioBERT which additionally

minority classes when presented with class imbalance, a common scenario in

overfitting when fine-tuning on an imbalanced dataset while the second allows
for more accurate modelling of the fine-tuning domain. An expert evaluation is
also conducted to reveal common outlier modes of each model. Our results could

architectural changes that are each theoretically and empirically justified,
including: learned relative positional encodings initialized with random walk
probabilities, a flexible attention mechanism that updates node and node-pair

that GRIT is expressive -- it can express shortest path distances and various

  Equivariance",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The explicit incorporation of task-specific inductive biases through symmetry
has emerged as a general design precept in the development of high-performance
machine learning models. For example, group equivariant neural networks have
demonstrated impressive performance across various domains and applications
such as protein and drug design. A prevalent intuition about such models is
that the integration of relevant symmetry results in enhanced generalization.
Moreover, it is posited that when the data and/or the model may only exhibit
$\textit{approximate}$ or $\textit{partial}$ symmetry, the optimal or
best-performing model is one where the model symmetry aligns with the data
symmetry. In this paper, we conduct a formal unified investigation of these
intuitions. To begin, we present general quantitative bounds that demonstrate
how models capturing task-specific symmetries lead to improved generalization.
In fact, our results do not require the transformations to be finite or even
form a group and can work with partial or approximate equivariance. Utilizing
this quantification, we examine the more general question of model
mis-specification i.e. when the model symmetries don't align with the data
symmetries. We establish, for a given symmetry group, a quantitative comparison
between the approximate/partial equivariance of the model and that of the data
distribution, precisely connecting model equivariance error and data
equivariance error. Our result delineates conditions under which the model
equivariance error is optimal, thereby yielding the best-performing model for
the given task and data.

to a lot of time spent painstakingly operating these apps by plugging in used

using an Internet of Things (IoT) approach. Specifically, beacons with embedded
ultra-low-power inertial measurement units (IMUs) are attached to the types of
equipment to recognize the usage and transmit the information to gym-goers and
managers. We have created a small ecosystem composed of beacons, a gateway,
smartwatches, android/iPhone applications, a firebase cloud server, and a
dashboard, all communicating over a mixture of Bluetooth and Wifi to distribute
collected data from machines to users and gym managers in a compact and
meaningful way. The system we have implemented is a working prototype of a
bigger end goal and is supposed to initialize progress toward a smarter, more
efficient, and still privacy-respect gym environment in the future. A
small-scale real-life test shows 94.6\% accuracy in user gym session recording,
which can reach up to 100\% easily with a more suitable assembling of the

optimization (HPO) of DL is often prohibitively expensive. This boosted the
emergence of tabular or surrogate benchmarks, which enable querying the

However, since actual runtimes of a DL training are significantly different
from query response times, in a naive implementation, simulators of an
asynchronous HPO, e.g. multi-fidelity optimization, must wait for the actual
runtimes at each iteration; otherwise, the evaluation order in the simulator
does not match with the real experiment. To ease this issue, we develop a
Python wrapper to force each worker to wait in order to match the evaluation

multi-label classification task, where each type of relation is simply treated
as a one-hot label. This formulation ignores the meaning of relations and wipes
out their intrinsic dependency. After examining the relation definitions in
various ETRE tasks, we observe that all relations can be interpreted using the
start and end time points of events. For example, relation \textit{Includes}
could be interpreted as event 1 starting no later than event 2 and ending no
earlier than event 2. In this paper, we propose a unified event temporal
relation extraction framework, which transforms temporal relations into logical
expressions of time points and completes the ETRE by predicting the relations
between certain time point pairs. Experiments on TB-Dense and MATRES show
significant improvements over a strong baseline and outperform the
state-of-the-art model by 0.3\% on both datasets. By representing all relations
in a unified framework, we can leverage the relations with sufficient data to
assist the learning of other relations, thus achieving stable improvement in
low-data scenarios. When the relation definitions are changed, our method can
quickly adapt to the new ones by simply modifying the logic expressions that

gradient tensor and structural features of local streamlines, we characterize
the evolution of the flow with a particular focus on its transition and
turbulent decay. Transition is excited by the development of the elliptic
instability, which grows during the mutual interaction of the rings as they
expand radially at the collision plane. The development of antiparallel
secondary vortex filaments along the circumference mediates the proliferation
of small-scale turbulence. During turbulent decay, the partitioning of the
velocity gradients approaches an equilibrium that is dominated by shearing and
agrees well with previous results for forced isotropic turbulence. We also
introduce new phase spaces for the velocity gradients that reflect the
interplay between shearing and rigid rotation and highlight geometric features
of local streamlines. In conjunction with our visualizations, these phase
spaces suggest that, while the elliptic instability is the predominant
mechanism driving the initial transition, its interplay with other mechanisms,
particularly the Crow instability, becomes more important during turbulent
decay. Our analysis suggests that the geometry-based phase space may be
promising for identifying the effects of the elliptic instability and other
mechanisms using the structure of local streamlines. Moving forward,
characterizing the organization of these mechanisms within vortices and
universal features of velocity gradients may aid in modeling the turbulent
cascade.

severe when the number of instruments is large. Hence, JIVE has been proposed
to reduce bias of over-identified TSLS. However, both methods have critical
drawbacks. While over-identified TSLS has a large bias with a large degree of
overidentification, JIVE is unstable. In this paper, I bridge the optimization
problems of TSLS and JIVE, solve the connected problem and propose a new
estimator TSJI. TSJI has a user-defined parameter $\lambda$. By approximating
the bias of the TSJI up to op(1/N), I find a $\lambda$ value that produces
approximately unbiased TSJI. TSJI with the selected $\lambda$ value not only
has the same first order distribution as TSLS when the number of first-stage
and second-stage regressors are fixed, but also is consistent and
asymptotically normal under many-instrument asymptotics. Under three different
simulation settings, I test TSJI against TSLS and JIVE with instruments of
different strengths. TSJI clearly outperforms TSLS and JIVE in simulations. I
apply TSJI to two empirical studies. TSJI mostly agrees with TSLS and JIVE, but
it also gives different conclusions from TSLS and JIVE for specific cases.

of prediction than Landau's later, more complicated model, with its 8 degrees
of freedom. The roton is identified with the massless notoph. This theory gives
a very satisfactory account of second and fourth sounds.
  Second sound is an adiabatic oscillation of the temperature and both vector
fields, with no net material motion. Fourth sound involves the roton, the
temperature and the density. With the experimental confirmation of
gravitational waves the relations between Hydrodynamics and Relativity and
particle physics have become more clear, and urgent. The appearance of the
Newtonian potential in irrotational hydrodynamics comes directly from
Einstein's equations for the metric. The density factor $\rho$ is essential; it
is time to acknowledge the role that it plays in particle theory.

this mode too is affected by the mass density, it turns out that the wave
function of the unique notoph propagating mode $\mathcal{N}$ satisfies the
normal massless wave equation $\Box\mathcal{N}$ = 0; the roton propagates as a
free particle in the bulk of the superfluid without meeting resistance. In this

dipole-dipole interaction because the molecules have a permanent dipole moment.
The workability of our approach has been demonstrated by estimating the
ground-state energy, order parameter and nearest neighbour correlation for the
systems of 2 and 3 HF molecules using quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on
the path integral ground state methodology. The results agree satisfactorily
with those obtained from exact Hamiltonian matrix diagonalization. In addition,
the effect of neighbours on the ground state properties has been investigated
for larger systems. The converged ground-state energy per neighbour as a
function of inter-nuclear separation is considered to be the equation of state
for the system.

core depth but also on the length scale of columnar convection. By
progressively increasing the buoyant forcing in a linear magnetoconvection
model, the slow Magnetic-Archimedean-Coriolis (MAC) waves are significantly
attenuated so that their kinetic helicity decreases to zero; the fast MAC wave
helicity, on the other hand, is practically unaffected. In turn, polarity
reversals in low-inertia spherical dynamos are shown to occur when the slow MAC
waves disappear under strong forcing. Two dynamically similar regimes are
identified -- the suppression of slow waves in a strongly forced dynamo and the
excitation of slow waves in a moderately forced dynamo starting from a small
seed field. While the former regime results in polarity reversals, the latter
regime produces the axial dipole from a chaotic multipolar state. For either
polarity transition, a local Rayleigh number based on the mean wavenumber of
the energy-containing scales bears the same linear relationship with the square
of the peak magnetic field measured at the transition. The self-similarity of
the dipole-multipole transition can place a constraint on the Rayleigh number

al. [Phys. Rev. Let. 125, 180401 (2020)], the oscillatory shock wave train
developing in this system from an initial localized density bump on a uniform
background was interpreted as a result of quantum mechanical self-interference,
wherein the interference contrast would diminish with the loss of matter-wave
phase coherence. Such loss of coherence, relative to the mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii description, occurs due to either quantum or thermal
fluctuations, as well as in the strongly interacting regime. In this work, we
extend the analysis of dispersive quantum shock waves in this context to other
dynamical scenarios. More specifically, the scenarios studied include evolution
of a sufficiently high density bump, known to lead to the so-called ``vacuum
point'' in the mean-field description, and evolution of an initial density dip,
known to shed a train of grey solitons in the same mean-field approximation. We
study the fate of these nonlinear wave structures in the presence of quantum
and thermal fluctuations, as well as at intermediate and strong interactions,
and show that both the vacuum point and grey solitons cease to manifest
themselves beyond the mean-field approach. On the other hand, we find that a
vacuum point can occur in an ideal (noninteracting) Bose gas evolving from a
ground state of a localized dimple potential. Due to the ubiquity of dispersive
shock waves in nature, our results should provide useful insights and

limited to a small set of predefined categories, and they struggle with unseen
objects in the real world. To address these issues, Generic Multiple Object
Tracking (GMOT) has been proposed, which requires less prior information about
the targets. However, all existing GMOT approaches follow a one-shot paradigm,
relying mainly on the initial bounding box and thus struggling to handle
variants e.g., viewpoint, lighting, occlusion, scale, and etc. In this paper,
we introduce a novel approach to address the limitations of existing MOT and
GMOT methods. Specifically, we propose a zero-shot GMOT (Z-GMOT) algorithm that
can track never-seen object categories with zero training examples, without the
need for predefined categories or an initial bounding box. To achieve this, we

evaluate our Z-GMOT thoroughly on the GMOT-40 dataset, AnimalTrack testset,
DanceTrack testset. The results of these evaluations demonstrate a significant

document plugins into the backbone PTM for downstream tasks, we can encode a
document one time to handle multiple tasks, which is more efficient than
conventional encoding-task coupling methods that simultaneously encode
documents and input queries using task-specific encoders. Extensive experiments
on 8 datasets of 4 typical NLP tasks show that PlugD enables models to encode
documents once and for all across different scenarios. Especially, PlugD can
save $69\%$ computational costs while achieving comparable performance to
state-of-the-art encoding-task coupling methods. Additionally, we show that
PlugD can serve as an effective post-processing way to inject knowledge into

additional tunable parameters as systems and controls respectively, PETs can be
theoretically grounded to optimal control and further viewed as optimizing the
terminal cost and running cost in the optimal control literature. Despite the
elegance of this theoretical grounding, in practice, existing PETs often ignore
the running cost and only optimize the terminal cost, i.e., focus on optimizing
the loss function of the output state, regardless of the running cost that
depends on the intermediate states. Since it is non-trivial to directly model
the intermediate states and design a running cost function, we propose to use
latent stochastic bridges to regularize the intermediate states and use the
regularization as the running cost of PETs. As the first work to propose
regularized PETs that use stochastic bridges as the regularizers (running
costs) for the intermediate states, we show the effectiveness and generality of
this regularization across different tasks, PLMs and PETs. In view of the great

allows one to correctly identify different topological phases and topological
phase transitions for all SSH models, but only when using the metric tensor

Hermitian systems is Riemannian, introducing non-Hermiticity leads to
pseudo-Riemannian and complex geometries, thus significantly generalizing from
the quantum geometries studied thus far. One remarkable example of this is the
mathematical agreement between topological phase transition curves and
lightlike paths in general relativity, suggesting a possibility of simulating
space-times in non-Hermitian systems. We find that the metric in non-Hermitian

of the quantum geometry by one. This implies that within linear response
theory, one can perturb the system by a particular change of parameters while

growing interest in this area, these generated explanations' effectiveness and
potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these
explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the
nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance,
an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator
that a benign piece of content is hateful. In light of this, we propose an
analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an
extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted
GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a
survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated
explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the
GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency,
informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive
nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting
strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect
judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need

computational cost and consensus latency. In addition, location-centric
characteristics of many IoT applications paired with limited storage and
computing power of IoT devices bring about more limitations, primarily due to
the location-agnostic designs in blockchains. We propose a hierarchical and
location-aware consensus protocol (LH-Raft) for IoT-blockchain applications
inspired by the original Raft protocol to address these limitations. The
proposed LH-Raft protocol forms local consensus candidate groups based on
nodes' reputation and distance to elect the leaders in each sub-layer
blockchain. It utilizes a threshold signature scheme to reach global consensus
and the local and global log replication to maintain consistency for blockchain
transactions. To evaluate the performance of LH-Raft, we first conduct an
extensive numerical analysis based on the proposed reputation mechanism and the
candidate group formation model. We then compare the performance of LH-Raft
against the classical Raft protocol from both theoretical and experimental
perspectives. We evaluate the proposed threshold signature scheme using
Hyperledger Ursa cryptography library to measure various consensus nodes'
signing and verification time. Experimental results show that the proposed
LH-Raft protocol is scalable for large IoT applications and significantly
reduces the communication cost, consensus latency, and agreement time for
consensus processing.

still require a significant number of parameters and storage when being applied
to broader ranges of tasks. To achieve even greater storage reduction, we
propose PROPETL, a novel method that enables efficient sharing of a single PETL
module which we call prototype network (e.g., adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning)
across layers and tasks. We then learn binary masks to select different
sub-networks from the shared prototype network and apply them as PETL modules
into different layers. We find that the binary masks can determine crucial
information from the network, which is often ignored in previous studies. Our
work can also be seen as a type of pruning method, where we find that
overparameterization also exists in the seemingly small PETL modules. We
evaluate PROPETL on various downstream tasks and show that it can outperform
other PETL methods with approximately 10% of the parameter storage required by
the latter.

Specifically, we use a trojan network to transform the inputs before sending

eigenvalues in order to obtain a tighter distribution and a smaller condition
number. Such changes induce a positive effect in the convergence behavior of
Krylov subspace methods, which are among the most popular iterative solvers for
large sparse linear systems. We develop a deflation strategy for symmetric
saddle point matrices by taking advantage of their underlying block structure.
The vectors used for deflation come from an elliptic singular value
decomposition relying on the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization process.
The block targeted by deflation is the off-diagonal one since it features a
problematic singular value distribution for certain applications. One example
is the Stokes flow in elongated channels, where the off-diagonal block has
several small, isolated singular values, depending on the length of the
channel. Applying deflation to specific parts of the saddle point system is
important when using solvers such as CRAIG, which operates on individual blocks
rather than the whole system. The theory is developed by extending the existing
framework for deflating square matrices before applying a Krylov subspace
method like MINRES. Numerical experiments confirm the merits of our strategy
and lead to interesting questions about using approximate vectors for
deflation.

increased utilization in various commercial and military applications. One such
application is signal source search and localization (SSSL) using UAVs, which
offers significant benefits over traditional ground-based methods due to
improved RF signal reception at higher altitudes and inherent autonomous 3D
navigation capabilities. Nevertheless, practical considerations such as
propagation models and antenna patterns are frequently neglected in
simulation-based studies in the literature. In this work, we address these
limitations by using a two-ray channel model and a dipole antenna pattern to
develop a simulator that more closely represents real-world radio signal
strength (RSS) observations at a UAV. We then examine and compare the
performance of previously proposed linear least square (LLS) based localization
techniques using UAVs for SSSL. Localization of radio frequency (RF) signal
sources is assessed based on two main criteria: 1) achieving the highest
possible accuracy and 2) localizing the target as quickly as possible with
reasonable accuracy. Various mission types, such as those requiring precise
localization like identifying hostile troops, and those demanding rapid
localization like search and rescue operations during disasters, have been
previously investigated. In this paper, the efficacy of the proposed
localization approaches is examined based on these two main localization
requirements through computer simulations.

automation and optimization of the logistic process while catering for
real-world imposed operational uncertainties, clients' preferred time
schedules, and safety of pedestrians. To this end, the integrated optimization
component is modeled as a robust variant of the Cumulative Capacitated Vehicle
Routing Problem with Time Windows, where routes are constructed under uncertain
travel times with an objective to minimize the total latency of deliveries
(i.e., the overall waiting time of customers, which can negatively affect their
satisfaction). We demonstrate the proposed LMD system's utility through
real-world trials in a university campus with a single robotic courier.
Implementation aspects as well as the findings and practical insights gained

number while keeping the sampling interval constant during the construction of
a finer cost volume. We also introduce occlusion maps to enhance accuracy in
constructing the occlusion-aware cost volume. Specifically, we first obtain the
coarse disparity map through the coarse disparity estimation network. Then, the
sub-aperture images (SAIs) of side views are warped to the center view based on
the initial disparity map. Next, we propose photo-consistency constraints
between the warped SAIs and the center SAI to generate occlusion maps for each
SAI. Finally, we introduce the coarse disparity map and occlusion maps to
construct an occlusion-aware refined cost volume, enabling the refined
disparity estimation network to yield a more precise disparity map. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with

statistical problem and has been used in a wide range of applications. However,

the isotonic regression problem presented in the article ""The isotonic

approach can be applied to both fixed and random designs and any number of

differences in the values (levels) of the monotonic function estimates, with
the weight of penalty being determined based on a statistical test, which
results in information being shared across data sets if similarities in the
regression functions exist. Function estimates are subsequently derived using
an iterative optimization routine that uses existing solution algorithms for
the isotonic regression problem. Simulation studies for normally and binomially
distributed response data illustrate that function estimates are consistently
improved if similarities between functions exist, and are not oversmoothed
otherwise. We further apply our methodology to analyse two public health data

recombination $\rho_{DM}=\alpha\;\rho_{DEV}$, is considered. Variants with a
dependence of the coefficient $\alpha(z)$ on the redshift are also considered.
One of the problems that have arisen in modern cosmology, called Hubble Tension

as predictability, which underlies fairness. Unfortunately, the existence of
such averages cannot be guaranteed with many traditional regulators, including
the proportional-integral (PI) regulator with or without deadband. Here, we
consider the effects of losses in the alternating current model and the

influence the harvesting between two static Unruh-DeWitt detectors. To this
end, we investigate the following burst profiles -- Gaussian, sech-squared, and
tanh. Out of these, the first two bursts contain no memory, while the latter
consists of a non-vanishing memory effect. We found that in all of these cases,
entanglement harvesting is possible, and it decreases with the increasing
distance between detectors. Moreover, the harvesting differs qualitatively
based on the presence or absence of the memory. For the two burst profiles
without memory, longer bursts correspond to greater harvesting in the low
detector transition energy regime, and this characteristic is reversed for
larger transition energy. Meanwhile, for the tanh type profile with memory,
harvesting is always greater for shorter bursts. We briefly discuss some of the
consequences of our findings.

regarding each set of phenomena by combining the received local sensor
decisions. Owing to the diverse nature of the sensors and heterogeneous nature
of the information they report, it becomes extremely challenging for the DFC to

noise. The primary contribution of this paper is to propose a flexible, robust

packet division multiplexing (WPDM). The local sensor observations from each
group of sensors are waveform coded onto wavelet packet basis functions before
reporting them over the MAC. We assume a multi-antenna DFC where the
waveform-coded sensor observations can be separated by a bank of linear filters

At the DFC we formulate and compare fusion rules for fusing received multiple

sentence embedding learning (WhitenedCSE), which combines contrastive learning
with a novel shuffled group whitening. Generally, contrastive learning pulls
distortions of a single sample (i.e., positive samples) close and push negative
samples far away, correspondingly facilitating the alignment and uniformity in
the feature space. A popular alternative to the ""pushing'' operation is
whitening the feature space, which scatters all the samples for uniformity.
Since the whitening and the contrastive learning have large redundancy w.r.t.
the uniformity, they are usually used separately and do not easily work
together. For the first time, this paper integrates whitening into the
contrastive learning scheme and facilitates two benefits. 1) Better uniformity.
We find that these two approaches are not totally redundant but actually have
some complementarity due to different uniformity mechanism. 2) Better
alignment. We randomly divide the feature into multiple groups along the
channel axis and perform whitening independently within each group. By
shuffling the group division, we derive multiple distortions of a single sample
and thus increase the positive sample diversity. Consequently, using multiple
positive samples with enhanced diversity further improves contrastive learning
due to better alignment. Extensive experiments on seven semantic textual
similarity tasks show our method achieves consistent improvement over the
contrastive learning baseline and sets new states of the art, e.g., 78.78\%
(+2.53\% based on BERT\ba) Spearman correlation on STS tasks.

analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov
(arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal
formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we
demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point
processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem
in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by
Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for
getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which
appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted
biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes
introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck
random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal
process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation
functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which
are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach
allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random
partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as
a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient
of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic
equation.

near-field spherical-wave-based channel models for spatially-discrete (SPD)
antennas. Then, uniform spherical wave (USW) and non-uniform spherical wave
(NUSW) models are discussed. Subsequently, we introduce a general near-field
channel model for SPD antennas and a Green's function-based channel model for
continuous-aperture (CAP) antennas. 2) Beamfocusing and Antenna Architectures:
We highlight the properties of near-field beamfocusing and discuss NFC antenna
architectures for both SPD and CAP antennas. Moreover, the basic principles of
near-field beam training are introduced. 3) Performance Analysis: Finally, we
provide a comprehensive performance analysis framework for NFC. For near-field
line-of-sight channels, the received signal-to-noise ratio and power-scaling
law are derived. For statistical near-field multipath channels, a general
analytical framework is proposed, based on which analytical expression for the

that, at runtime, checks whether the (partial) signals of a system satisfy a
specification in, e.g., Signal Temporal Logic (STL). The classic STL monitoring
is performed by computing a robustness interval that specifies, at each
instant, how far the monitored signals are from violating and satisfying the
specification. However, since a robustness interval monotonically shrinks
during monitoring, classic online monitors may fail in reporting new violations
or in precisely describing the system evolution at the current instant. In this
paper, we tackle these issues by considering the causation of violation or
satisfaction, instead of directly using the robustness. We first introduce a
Boolean causation monitor that decides whether each instant is relevant to the
violation or satisfaction of the specification. We then extend this monitor to
a quantitative causation monitor that tells how far an instant is from being
relevant to the violation or satisfaction. We further show that classic
monitors can be derived from our proposed ones. Experimental results show that
the two proposed monitors are able to provide more detailed information about
system evolution, without requiring a significantly higher monitoring cost.

diversity-seeking jump game always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, if all

Nash equilibrium from any initial placement of agents.

conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals is attributed to near-ideal phonon quantum
gases, while undesired limitations arise from electron-phonon (e-ph)
interactions which have been shown to limit the thermal conductivity up to
several microns away. The e-ph thermal conductivity is directly linked to the
phonon scattering rate. Conventional calculations overlook phonons with
short-dispersive wavelengths, rendering them inadequate for analyzing 2D Dirac
crystals. The phonon scattering rate is typically calculated up to the
first-order magnitude, considering 3-particle interactions involving the decay
of an electron and phonon (EP-E*) to create a new electron. However, processes
involving the decay of an electron and the creation of a new electron and
phonon (E-E*P*) are neglected. In this study, we present an accurate expression
for the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac

the significance of the E-E*P* process even at room temperature in calculating
the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity, particularly for
first-order e-ph interactions. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of
incorporating second-order e-ph interactions, specifically the EP-E*P*
interaction involving the decay of an electron and phonon and the creation of a

perception. DNNs are hard to analyze due to their size (they can have thousands
or millions of parameters), lack of formal specifications (DNNs are typically
learnt from labeled data, in the absence of any formal requirements), and
sensitivity to small changes in the environment. We present an assume-guarantee
style compositional approach for the formal verification of system-level safety
properties of such autonomous systems. Our insight is that we can analyze the
system in the absence of the DNN perception components by automatically
synthesizing assumptions on the DNN behaviour that guarantee the satisfaction
of the required safety properties. The synthesized assumptions are the weakest
in the sense that they characterize the output sequences of all the possible
DNNs that, plugged into the autonomous system, guarantee the required safety
properties. The assumptions can be leveraged as run-time monitors over a
deployed DNN to guarantee the safety of the overall system; they can also be
mined to extract local specifications for use during training and testing of
DNNs. We illustrate our approach on a case study taken from the autonomous
airplanes domain that uses a complex DNN for perception.

thickening process to iteratively refine its generation through that network.
We demonstrate when learning to jump is expected to perform comparably to

PARAFAC2 decomposition is a crucial tool for analyzing irregular tensors.
Although real-time analysis is necessary in the dual-way streaming, static
PARAFAC2 decomposition methods fail to efficiently work in this setting since
they perform PARAFAC2 decomposition for accumulated tensors whenever new data
arrive. Existing streaming PARAFAC2 decomposition methods work in a limited

performs PARAFAC2 decomposition by carefully dividing the terms related to old

Furthermore, applying a forgetting factor makes Dash follow recent movements.
Extensive experiments show that Dash achieves up to 14.0x faster speed than

novel label noise type called BadLabel, which can significantly degrade the

based on the label-flipping attack against standard classification, where
specific samples are selected and their labels are flipped to other labels so
that the loss values of clean and noisy labels become indistinguishable. To
address the challenge posed by BadLabel, we further propose a robust LNL method

loss values of clean and noisy labels again distinguishable. Once we select a

semi-supervised learning to train the model accurately. Empirically, our

dataset's underlying sources of variation and represent them independently of
one another. Since the model is provided with no ground truth information about
these sources, inductive biases take a paramount role in enabling
disentanglement. In this work, we construct an inductive bias towards
compositionally encoding and decoding data by enforcing a harsh communication
bottleneck. Concretely, we do this by (i) quantizing the latent space into
learnable discrete codes with a separate scalar codebook per dimension and (ii)
applying strong model regularization via an unusually high weight decay.
Intuitively, the quantization forces the encoder to use a small number of
latent values across many datapoints, which in turn enables the decoder to
assign a consistent meaning to each value. Regularization then serves to drive
the model towards this parsimonious strategy. We demonstrate the broad
applicability of this approach by adding it to both basic data-reconstructing
(vanilla autoencoder) and latent-reconstructing (InfoGAN) generative models. In
order to reliably assess these models, we also propose InfoMEC, new metrics for
disentanglement that are cohesively grounded in information theory and fix
well-established shortcomings in previous metrics. Together with
regularization, latent quantization dramatically improves the modularity and
explicitness of learned representations on a representative suite of benchmark

outperforms strong methods from prior work in these key disentanglement

We compare our approach with ImgBERT, a multimodal model that uses only learned

incorrect predictions is a longstanding challenge. This challenge is further
exacerbated when learning has to be differentially private: protection provided
to sensitive data comes at the price of injecting additional randomness into
the learning process. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical
investigation of selective classifiers -- that can abstain when they are unsure
-- under a differential privacy constraint. We find that several popular
selective prediction approaches are ineffective in a differentially private
setting as they increase the risk of privacy leakage. At the same time, we
identify that a recent approach that only uses checkpoints produced by an
off-the-shelf private learning algorithm stands out as particularly suitable
under DP. Further, we show that differential privacy does not just harm utility
but also degrades selective classification performance. To analyze this effect
across privacy levels, we propose a novel evaluation mechanism which isolate
selective prediction performance across model utility levels. Our experimental
results show that recovering the performance level attainable by non-private
models is possible but comes at a considerable coverage cost as the privacy
budget decreases.

LoRAPrune delivers an accurate, compact model for efficient inference in a

recently and by learning the unconditional score. While this approach has some
advantages, depending on the specific inverse problem at hand, in order to

demonstrates that prior label bias calibration methods fall short of addressing

random-level performance on many tasks regardless of the choice of in-context

calibration method that estimates a language model's label bias using random

  2023",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The RoboCup competitions hold various leagues, and the Soccer Simulation 2D
League is a major one among them. Soccer Simulation 2D (SS2D) match involves
two teams, including 11 players and a coach, competing against each other. The
players can only communicate with the Soccer Simulation Server during the game.
This paper presents the latest research of the CYRUS soccer simulation 2D team,
the champion of RoboCup 2021. We will explain our denoising idea powered by
long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and deep neural networks (DNN). The
CYRUS team uses the CYRUS2D base code that was developed based on the Helios
and Gliders bases.

businesses looking to capitalize on the benefits of AI and ML models. This
research presents a detailed review of MLOps, its benefits, difficulties,
evolutions, and important underlying technologies such as MLOps frameworks,
Docker, GitHub actions, and Kubernetes. The MLOps workflow, which includes
model design, deployment, and operations, is explained in detail along with the
various tools necessary for both model and data exploration and deployment.
This article also puts light on the end-to-end production of ML projects using
various maturity levels of automated pipelines, with the least at no automation
at all and the highest with complete CI/CD and CT capabilities. Furthermore, a
detailed example of an enterprise-level MLOps project for an object detection
service is used to explain the workflow of the technology in a real-world
scenario. For this purpose, a web application hosting a pre-trained model from
TensorFlow 2 Model Zoo is packaged and deployed to the internet making sure
that the system is scalable, reliable, and optimized for deployment at an
enterprise level.

this letter, stressing the contribution of the stress tensor generating its
curvature. The null and timelike geodesics are computed in the pure
cosmological case when the Eisenhart potential energy is $V(r) =
-m\omega^{2}r^{2}/2$, where $\omega$ is related to the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Although the metric is curved, the radial null geodesics $R(T)$ and
$Y(T)$ are straight lines, with finite $R_{max}$ and $Y_{max}$, $Y$ being the
5th coordinate. In contrast, for a radial timelike geodesic, $Y_{max}
\rightarrow \infty$ if $T \rightarrow T_{max} = 1/\omega$.

Classification of Diseases (ICD) code; a list of classification codes for
medical diagnoses and procedures. ICD coding is a challenging multilabel text
classification problem due to noisy clinical document inputs and long-tailed
label distribution. Recent automated ICD coding efforts improve performance by
encoding medical notes and codes with additional data and knowledge bases.
However, most of them do not reflect how human coders generate the code: first,
the coders select general code categories and then look for specific
subcategories that are relevant to a patient's condition. Inspired by this, we
propose a two-stage decoding mechanism to predict ICD codes. Our model uses the
hierarchical properties of the codes to split the prediction into two steps: At
first, we predict the parent code and then predict the child code based on the
previous prediction. Experiments on the public MIMIC-III data set show that our
model performs well in single-model settings without external data or
knowledge.

  Approach for Cloud Masking and Reconstruction","33 pages, 18 figures; Masters Thesis",,,,"cs.CV physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis presents a new algorithm to mitigate cloud masking in the
analysis of sea surface temperature (SST) data generated by remote sensing
technologies, e.g., Clouds interfere with the analysis of all remote sensing
data using wavelengths shorter than 12 microns, significantly limiting the
quantity of usable data and creating a biased geographical distribution
(towards equatorial and coastal regions). To address this issue, we propose an
unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Enki which uses a Vision
Transformer with Masked Autoencoding to reconstruct masked pixels. We train
four different models of Enki with varying mask ratios (t) of 10%, 35%, 50%,
and 75% on the generated Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) dataset
referred to as LLC4320. To evaluate performance, we reconstruct a validation
set of LLC4320 SST images with random ``clouds'' corrupting p=10%, 20%, 30%,
40%, 50% of the images with individual patches of 4x4 pixel^2. We consistently
find that at all levels of p there is one or multiple models that reconstruct
the images with a mean RMSE of less than 0.03K, i.e. lower than the estimated
sensor error of VIIRS data. Similarly, at the individual patch level, the
reconstructions have RMSE 8x smaller than the fluctuations in the patch. And,
as anticipated, reconstruction errors are larger for images with a higher
degree of complexity. Our analysis also reveals that patches along the image
border have systematically higher reconstruction error; we recommend ignoring
these in production. We conclude that Enki shows great promise to surpass
in-painting as a means of reconstructing cloud masking. Future research will
develop Enki to reconstruct real-world data.

experts (MoE) has recently become a fundamental building block of highly
successful modern deep neural networks for heterogeneous data analysis in
several applications, including those in machine learning, statistics,
bioinformatics, economics, and medicine. Despite its popularity in practice, a
satisfactory level of understanding of the convergence behavior of
Gaussian-gated MoE parameter estimation is far from complete. The underlying
reason for this challenge is the inclusion of covariates in the Gaussian gating
and expert networks, which leads to their intrinsically complex interactions
via partial differential equations with respect to their parameters. We address
these issues by designing novel Voronoi loss functions to accurately capture
heterogeneity in the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for resolving parameter
estimation in these models. Our results reveal distinct behaviors of the MLE
under two settings: the first setting is when all the location parameters in
the Gaussian gating are non-zeros while the second setting is when there exists
at least one zero-valued location parameter. Notably, these behaviors can be
characterized by the solvability of two different systems of polynomial
equations. Finally, we conduct a simulation study to verify our theoretical
results.

perovskite solar cells are largely driven by innovations in material science.
However, closing the gap to commercialization still requires significant
innovation to match contradicting requirements such as performance, longevity
and recyclability. The rate of innovation, as of today, is limited by a lack of
design principles linking chemical motifs to functional microscopic structures,
and by an incapacity to experimentally access microscopic structures from
investigating macroscopic device properties. In this work, we envision a layout
of a Digital Twin for PV materials aimed at removing both limitations. The
layout combines machine learning approaches, as performed in materials
acceleration platforms (MAPs), with mathematical models derived from the
underlying physics and digital twin concepts from the engineering world. This
layout will allow using high-throughput (HT) experimentation in MAPs to improve
the parametrization of quantum chemical and solid-state models. In turn, the
improved and generalized models can be used to obtain the crucial structural
parameters from HT data. HT experimentation will thus yield a detailed
understanding of generally valid structure-property relationships, enabling
inverse molecular design, that is, predicting the optimal chemical structure
and process conditions to build PV devices satisfying a multitude of
requirements at the same time. After motivating our proposed layout of the
digital twin with causal relationships in material science, we discuss the
current state of the enabling technologies, already being able to yield insight
from HT data today. We identify open challenges with respect to the multiscale
nature of PV materials and the needed volume and diversity of data, and mention
promising approaches to address these challenges.

via estimation of the amount of unobserved offenses associated with particular
demographics. These unobserved offenses are then used to augment real-world
arrest records to create part real, part synthetic crime records. Using this

similar \emph{arrest} record, but the gap grows to 4.5--11.0 percentage points

discussing the potential risks around the use of RAIs, highlighting how they
may exacerbate existing inequalities if the underlying disparities of the

we provide recommendations to improve the development and evaluation of such

significant underestimate of the early ($\lesssim 2$ days) optical emission.
Our model indicates that NSBH-driven kilonovae may peak up to a week after
merger at optical wavelengths for some observer angles. This demonstrates the
need for early coverage of emergent kilonovae in cases where the GW signal is
either ambiguous or absent; they likely cannot be distinguished from BNS
mergers by the light curves alone from $\sim 2$ days after the merger. We also

privacy protection strategies to realize privacy-preserved prediction model.
Furthermore, based on trajectory and popular content prediction results,

effect of asymmetry of the intensity of emission due to inverse Compton
scattering (ICS) of a possible population of relativistic electrons and
positrons ($e^\pm$) in the galactic halo on starlight photons. This asymmetry
is expected to exist around the major galactic axis, and arises due to
anisotropy of the interstellar radiation field and the inclination of M31. ICS
emission and its asymmetry were modeled by GALPROP code for the trial case of
$e^\pm$ generated by annihilating weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)
with various properties. The asymmetry was obtained to appear at photon
energies above $\sim$ 0.1 MeV. Morphological and spectral properties of the
asymmetry were studied in detail. Potential observational detection of the
asymmetry may allow to infer the leptonic fraction in the emission generation
mechanism, thus providing valuable inferences for understanding the nature of
M31 gamma-ray halo emission. Specific asymmetry predictions were made for the
recently claimed DM interpretation of the outer halo emission. The paper also
studied the role of secondary -- ICS and bremsstrahlung -- emissions due to DM
annihilation for that interpretation. And, finally, the latter was shown to be

be linked to the scale at which the Standard Model breaks down due to a Landau
pole/triviality problem: for a Higgs mass somewhat higher than the measured
value, the Standard Model breaks down before the Planck scale. We take a first
step towards investigating this relation in the context of causal set quantum
gravity. We use a scalar-field propagator that carries the imprints of
spacetime discreteness in a modified ultraviolet behavior that depends on a
nonlocality scale. We investigate whether the modification can shift the scale
of the Landau pole in a scalar field theory with quartic interaction. We
discover that the modifications speed up the onset of the Landau pole
considerably, so that the scale of new physics occurs roughly at the
nonlocality scale. Our results call into question, whether a separation between
the nonlocality scale and the discreteness scale, which is postulated within
causal set quantum gravity, and which has been argued to give rise to
phenomenological consequences, is in fact achievable. Methodologically, our
paper is the first to apply continuum functional Renormalization Group

The generator in GANs transform noise vectors, typically Gaussian distributed,

for training GANs with images as inputs, but without enforcing any pairwise
constraints. The intuition is that images are more structured than noise, which
the generator can leverage to learn a more robust transformation. The process
can be made efficient by identifying closely related datasets, or a ``friendly
neighborhood'' of the target distribution, inspiring the moniker, Spider GAN.
To define friendly neighborhoods leveraging proximity between datasets, we
propose a new measure called the signed inception distance (SID), inspired by
the polyharmonic kernel. We show that the Spider GAN formulation results in
faster convergence, as the generator can discover correspondence even between
seemingly unrelated datasets, for instance, between Tiny-ImageNet and CelebA
faces. Further, we demonstrate cascading Spider GAN, where the output
distribution from a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the input to the
subsequent network. Effectively, transporting one distribution to another in a
cascaded fashion until the target is learnt -- a new flavor of transfer
learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of the Spider approach on DCGAN,
conditional GAN, PGGAN, StyleGAN2 and StyleGAN3. The proposed approach achieves

  incentivization scheme for a customized modular bus system","None",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an emerging travel mode, the modular vehicle system (MVS) is receiving
increasing attention. In particular, the operators could connect multiple
modular vehicles as an assembled bus in response to the temporary demand
varies. Therefore, in this study, the MVS is adopted in the context of
customized bus design to satisfy passengers reserved travel demand. In
addition, to increase the potential of the customized modular bus system, the
transfer among buses can be considered to group the passengers with the same or
close destinations. However, the passengers will not actively transfer as it is
viewed as a disutility. Thus, the appropriate incentivization should be
provided. To this end, we jointly optimize the passenger-route assignment and
the transfer incentivization scheme, in which the transfer demand is considered
elastically under different incentivization. Then, the linearization approaches
are adopted to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed integer
linear programming model, which can be solved by state-of-the-art solvers. The
experiment on the small network reveals that the performance of the bus system
with an incentivization scheme is better than that without an incentivization
scheme, and the extent of such superiority depends on the total demand level in
the system.

determined from a single trained model that can be used to estimate the model
uncertainty for image reconstructions. We demonstrate a monotonic relationship
between the local Lipschitz value and Mean Absolute Error and show that this
method can be used to provide a threshold that determines whether a given DL

method can be used to identify out-of-distribution test samples, relate

types of planar and (hemi)spherical gas density gradients, focusing on the case
in which streamers propagate from a region of density n0 towards a region of
higher gas density, where n0 corresponds to 300 K and 1 bar. We observe
streamer branching at the density gradient, with branches growing in a
flower-like pattern over the gradient surface. Depending on the gas density
ratio, the gradient width and other factors, narrow branches are able to
propagate into the higher-density gas. In a planar geometry, we find that such
propagation is possible up to a gas density slope of 3.5n0/mm, although this
value depends on a number of conditions, such as the gradient angle.
Surprisingly, a higher applied voltage makes it more difficult for streamers to
penetrate into the high-density region, due to an increase of the primary

recognition technology that can be implemented on low-power devices using
limited sensor data instead of high-dimensional inputs like hand images. In
this work, we demonstrate a hand gesture recognition system and method that
uses signals from capacitive sensors embedded into the etee hand controller.
The controller generates real-time signals from each of the wearer five
fingers. We use a machine learning technique to analyse the time series signals
and identify three features that can represent 5 fingers within 500 ms. The
analysis is composed of a two stage training strategy, including dimension
reduction through principal component analysis and classification with K
nearest neighbour. Remarkably, we found that this combination showed a level of
performance which was comparable to more advanced methods such as supervised
variational autoencoder. The base system can also be equipped with the
capability to learn from occasional errors by providing it with an additional
adaptive error correction mechanism. The results showed that the error
corrector improve the classification performance in the base system without
compromising its performance. The system requires no more than 1 ms of

rigorous twelve-dimensional (12D) quantum calculations of the coupled

introduced recently for fully coupled 9D quantum calculations of the
intermolecular vibrational states of noncovalently bound trimers comprised of
diatomics treated as rigid. In this paper it is extended to include the
intramolecular stretching coordinates of the three diatomic monomers. The
cornerstone of our 12D methodology is the partitioning of the full vibrational
Hamiltonian of the trimer into two reduced-dimension Hamiltonians, one in 9D
for the intermolecular degrees of freedom (DOFs) and another in 3D for the
intramolecular vibrations of the trimer, and a remainder term. These two
Hamiltonians are diagonalized separately and a fraction of their respective 9D
and 3D eigenstates is included in the 12D product contracted basis for both the
intra- and intermolecular DOFs, in which the matrix of the full 12D vibrational
Hamiltonian of the trimer is diagonalized. This methodology is implemented in
the 12D quantum calculations of the coupled intra- and intermolecular
vibrational states of the hydrogen-bonded HF trimer on an {\it ab initio}
calculated potential energy surface (PES). They reveal several interesting
manifestations of significant coupling between the intra- and intermolecular
vibrational modes of (HF)$_3$. The 12D calculations also show that the
frequencies of the $v=1,2$ HF stretching states of HF trimer are strongly
redshifted in comparison to those of the isolated HF monomer. The agreement

satisfactory, leaves room for improvement and points to the need for a more

observations, the formation of initial partial disorder was followed by
complete amorphization and void formation occurring at the fluence of about

Text2Cohort, a large language model (LLM) based toolkit to facilitate

Text2Cohorts translates user input into IDC database queries using prompt

Autocorrection resolves errors in queries by passing the errors back to the
model for interpretation and correction. We evaluate Text2Cohort on 50 natural
language user inputs ranging from information extraction to cohort discovery.
The resulting queries and outputs were verified by two computer scientists to
measure Text2Cohort's accuracy and F1 score. Text2Cohort successfully generated
queries and their responses with an 88% accuracy and F1 score of 0.94. However,
it failed to generate queries for 6/50 (12%) user inputs due to syntax and
semantic errors. Our results indicate that Text2Cohort succeeded at generating
queries with correct responses, but occasionally failed due to a lack of
understanding of the data schema. Despite these shortcomings, Text2Cohort
demonstrates the utility of LLMs to enable researchers to discover and curate
cohorts using data hosted on IDC with high levels of accuracy using natural

subject to multiple two-sided linear matrix inequalities intersected with a
low-rank and spectral constrained domain set. Although solving LSOP is, in
general, NP-hard, its partial convexification (i.e., replacing the domain set
by its convex hull) termed ""LSOP-R,"" is often tractable and yields a
high-quality solution. This motivates us to study the strength of LSOP-R.
Specifically, we derive rank bounds for any extreme point of the feasible set
of LSOP-R and prove their tightness for the domain sets with different matrix
spaces. The proposed rank bounds recover two well-known results in the
literature from a fresh angle and also allow us to derive sufficient conditions
under which the relaxation LSOP-R is equivalent to the original LSOP. To
effectively solve LSOP-R, we develop a column generation algorithm with a
vector-based convex pricing oracle, coupled with a rank-reduction algorithm,
which ensures the output solution satisfies the theoretical rank bound.
Finally, we numerically verify the strength of the LSOP-R and the efficacy of
the proposed algorithms.

engines to classify images uploaded on them as having potentially objectionable
content. Such moderation engines must answer a large number of queries with
heavy computational cost, even though the actual number of images with
objectionable content is usually a tiny fraction. Inspired by recent work on
Neural Group Testing, we propose an approach which exploits this fact to reduce
the overall computational cost of such engines using the technique of
Compressed Sensing (CS). We present the quantitative matrix-pooled neural
network (QMPNN), which takes as input $n$ images, and a $m \times n$ binary
pooling matrix with $m < n$, whose rows indicate $m$ pools of images i.e.
selections of $r$ images out of $n$. The QMPNN efficiently outputs the product
of this matrix with the unknown sparse binary vector indicating whether each
image is objectionable or not, i.e. it outputs the number of objectionable
images in each pool. For suitable matrices, this is decoded using CS decoding
algorithms to predict which images were objectionable. The computational cost
of running the QMPNN and the CS algorithms is significantly lower than the cost
of using a neural network with the same number of parameters separately on each
image to classify the images, which we demonstrate via extensive experiments.
Our technique is inherently resilient to moderate levels of errors in the
prediction from the QMPNN. Furthermore, we present pooled deep outlier
detection, which brings CS and group testing techniques to deep outlier
detection, to provide for the case when the objectionable images do not belong
to a set of pre-defined classes. This technique enables efficient automated
moderation of off-topic images shared on topical forums dedicated to sharing
images of a certain single class, many of which are currently human-moderated.

These oscillations arise as a result of resource deprivation. Our model tests a
hypothesis that the oscillations occur as multiple pathways share a limited
resource which we equate to the number of available ribosomes. We initially
explore a single-protein model with a constraint equation governing the total
resource available to the cell. The model is then extended to include three
coupled proteins that share the same resource pool. Three approaches are
considered to numerically detect existence of a limit cycle. First, numerical
stability diagrams are generated in the parameter space by plotting response
features resulting from nonlinear simulations. We use features such as the
standard deviation and maximum 1D persistent homology to analyze the solutions.
The second method uses a spectral element approach to solve a boundary value
problem to estimate the period of oscillation. Finally, we use the spectral
element method to approximate the system as a high dimensional discrete map and
evaluate the stability of the linearized system by examining its eigenvalues.
  Our results show that for certain combinations of total resource available to
the cell and the time delay lead to limit cycles whereby the equilibrium
solution loses stability via Hopf bifurcation. Further, for certain protein
production times (delays) in the three protein model, we observe a phase shift
in the protein production rates suggesting that our model correctly captures
the shared resource pool dynamics.

development of study designs incorporating real-world data (RWD). Using the
Causal Roadmap, we specify three designs to evaluate the difference in risk of
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) with oral semaglutide versus
standard-of-care: 1) the actual sequence of non-inferiority and superiority
randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 2) a single RCT, and 3) a hybrid
randomized-external data study. Methods: The hybrid design considers
integration of the PIONEER 6 RCT with RWD controls using the
experiment-selector cross-validated targeted maximum likelihood estimator. We
evaluate 95% confidence interval coverage, power, and average patient-time
during which participants would be precluded from receiving a glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP1-RA) for each design using simulations.
Finally, we estimate the effect of oral semaglutide on MACE for the hybrid
PIONEER 6-RWD analysis. Results: In simulations, Designs 1 and 2 performed
similarly. The tradeoff between decreased coverage and patient-time without the
possibility of a GLP1-RA for Designs 1 and 3 depended on the simulated bias. In
real data analysis using Design 3, external controls were integrated in 84% of
cross-validation folds, resulting in an estimated risk difference of
-1.53%-points (95% CI -2.75%-points to -0.30%-points). Conclusions: The Causal
Roadmap helps investigators to minimize potential bias in studies using RWD and
to quantify tradeoffs between study designs. The simulation results help to
interpret the level of evidence provided by the real data analysis in support
of the superiority of oral semaglutide versus standard-of-care for
cardiovascular risk reduction.

across 14,700 deg$^2$ (180 quasars deg$^{-2}$) and Planck 2018 CMB lensing at
$\sim$30$\sigma$. We use the cross-correlation on very large scales to
constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity via the scale dependence of quasar
bias. The DESI quasar targets lie at an effective redshift of 1.51 and are
separated into four imaging regions of varying depth and image quality. We
select quasar targets from Legacy Survey DR9 imaging, apply additional flux and
photometric redshift cuts to improve the purity and reduce the fraction of
unclassified redshifts, and use early DESI spectroscopy of 194,000 quasar
targets to determine their redshift distribution and stellar contamination
fraction (2.6%). Due to significant excess large-scale power in the quasar
autocorrelation, we apply weights to mitigate contamination from imaging
systematics such as depth, extinction, and stellar density. We use realistic
contaminated mocks to determine the greatest number of systematic modes that we
can fit, before we are biased by overfitting and spuriously remove real power.
We find that linear regression with one to seven imaging templates removed per
region accurately recovers the input cross-power, $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ and linear
bias. As in previous analyses, our $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ constraint depends on the
linear primordial non-Gaussianity bias parameter, $b_{\phi} = 2(b - p)\delta_c$
assuming universality of the halo mass function. We measure $f_{\textrm{NL}} =
-26^{+45}_{-40}$ with $p=1.6$ $(f_{\textrm{NL}} = -18^{+29}_{-27}$ with
$p=1.0$), and find that this result is robust under several systematics tests.
Future spectroscopic quasar cross-correlations with Planck lensing lensing can
tighten the $f_{\textrm{NL}}$ constraints by a factor of 2 if they can remove
the excess power on large scales in the quasar auto power spectrum.

  The modeling of cloud computing systems is an essential step towards
automatic management, but the modeling of cloud systems of such complexity
remains challenging and, as yet, unaddressed. In fact modeling resource
consumption will be a key to comparing the outcome of possible deployment
scenarios. This paper considers how to derive resource models for cloud systems
empirically. We do so based on models of deployed services in a formal modeling

antiferromagnetism featuring various long-wavelength modulations. For magnetic
fields applied in the hard magnetic basal plane, well-defined regimes of
cycloidal, conical, and fan-like superstructures may be distinguished that
encompass a pocket of commensurate type A order without superstructure. For
magnetic field applied along the easy axis, the phase diagram comprises the

three-dimensional CCSN simulation with zero-age main sequence mass of $27\

frequency range and/or time window from the neutrino event rate detectable at
the IceCube Neutrino Observatory; 2.~the use of the neutrino event rate to
build a matched filter template. We find that incorporating information from
the SASI modulations of the IceCube neutrino event rate can increase the
detection efficiency compared to standard GW excess energy searches up to
$30\%$ for nearby CCSNe. However, we do not find significant improvements in
the overall GW detection efficiency for CCSNe more distant than $1.5$~kpc. We
demonstrate that the matched filter approach performs better than the unmodeled
search method, which relies on a frequency bandpass inferred from the neutrino

calls for additional work to outline the best strategy for the first GW
detection from CCSNe.

hypercharge, then only third family renormalisable Yukawa couplings are
allowed. However, non-renormalisable Yukawa couplings may be induced by the
high scale Higgs fields (hyperons) which break the three hypercharges down to
the SM hypercharge, providing an explanation for fermion mass hierarchies and
the smallness of CKM quark mixing. Following a similar methodology, we study
the origin of neutrino masses and mixing in this model. Due to the TH gauge
symmetry, the implementation of a seesaw mechanism naturally leads to a low
scale seesaw, where the right-handed neutrinos in the model may be as light as
the TeV scale. We present simple examples of hyperon fields which can reproduce
all quark and lepton (including neutrino) masses and mixing. After a

energies up to a few PeV ($10^{15}$ eV) remains a theoretical and observational
challenge. Supernova remnants (SNRs) represent strong candidates, as they
provide sufficient energetics to reproduce the CR flux observed at Earth.
However, it remains unclear whether they can accelerate particles to PeV
energies, particularly after the very early stages of their evolution. This
uncertainty has prompted searches for other source classes and necessitates
comprehensive theoretical modeling of the maximum proton energy, $E_{\rm max}$,
accelerated by an arbitrary shock. While analytic estimates of $E_{\rm max}$
have been put forward in the literature, they do not fully account for the
complex interplay between particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification,
and shock evolution. This paper uses a multi-zone, semi-analytic model of
particle acceleration based on kinetic simulations to place constraints on
$E_{\rm max}$ for a wide range of astrophysical shocks. In particular, we
develop relationships between $E_{\rm max}$, shock velocity, size, and ambient
medium. We find that SNRs can only accelerate PeV particles under a select set
of circumstances, namely, if the shock velocity exceeds $\sim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$
and escaping particles drive magnetic field amplification. However, older,
slower SNRs may still produce observational signatures of PeV particles due to
populations accelerated when the shock was younger. Our results serve as a
reference for modelers seeking to quickly produce a self-consistent estimate of
the maximum energy accelerated by an arbitrary astrophysical shock.

$\langle M_{\rm BH} \rangle\simeq 10^{9.7}M_\odot$), with no difference in
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ or $M_{\rm BH}$ between X-ray weak and X-ray normal

FeII, finding that X-ray weak quasars display higher FeII/MgII ratios with
respect to typical quasars. FeII/MgII ratios of X-ray normal quasars are
instead consistent with other estimates up to $z\simeq6.5$, corroborating the
idea of already chemically mature BLRs at early cosmic time. From the $K_S$

[OIII] emission (EW<10 $\rm \mathring{A}$) than the normal ones. The sample as
a whole, however, abides by the known X-ray/[OIII] luminosity correlation,
hence the different [OIII] properties are likely due to an intrinsically weaker
[OIII] emission in X-ray weak objects, associated to the shape of the spectral
energy distribution. We interpret these results in the framework of

solve this problem, we develop a novel algorithm based on Accelerated Wirtinger
Flow that uses Score-based Diffusion models as the generative prior (AWFSD). In
particular, we frame the PR problem as an optimization task that involves both
a data fidelity term and a regularization term. We derive the gradient of the
PG log-likelihood function along with its corresponding Lipschitz constant,
ensuring a more accurate data consistency term for practical measurements. We
introduce a generative prior as part of our regularization approach by using a
score-based diffusion model to capture (the gradient of) the image prior

convergence guarantee for the proposed AWFSD algorithm. Our simulation
experiments demonstrate that: 1) The proposed algorithm based on the PG
likelihood model enhances reconstruction compared to that solely based on
either Gaussian or Poisson likelihood. 2) The proposed AWFSD algorithm produces
reconstructions with higher image quality both qualitatively and
quantitatively, and is more robust to variations in noise levels when compared

a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the

hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks (FFNets),
finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal

response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show
that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter
lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an
analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only
weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby
explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides
a framework for theory-guided optimal scaling in ResNets and, more generally,
provides the theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite widths.

circumvents this limitation by resorting to repeated gate approximations: every
occurrence of a gate which cannot be exactly represented over $\mathbb{G}$ is
replaced by an approximating circuit. Here, we introduce catalytic embeddings,
which provide an alternative to repeated gate approximations. With catalytic
embeddings, approximations are relegated to the preparation of a fixed number
of reusable resource states called catalysts. Because the catalysts only need
to be prepared once, when catalytic embeddings exist they always produce
shorter circuits, in the limit of increasing gate count and target precision.
In the present paper, we lay the foundations of the theory of catalytic

formalizes the search for optimal experimental designs by identifying

parametric in an exogenous signal. From a learning perspective, the goal is to
learn the expert's cost function given a dataset of signals and corresponding
optimal actions. Motivated by the geometry of the IO set of consistent cost
vectors, we introduce the ""incenter"" concept, a new notion akin to circumcenter
recently proposed by Besbes et al. [2022]. Discussing the geometric and
robustness interpretation of the incenter cost vector, we develop corresponding
tractable convex reformulations, which are in contrast with the circumcenter,
which we show is equivalent to an intractable optimization program. We further
propose a novel loss function called Augmented Suboptimality Loss (ASL), as a
relaxation of the incenter concept, for problems with inconsistent data.
Exploiting the structure of the ASL, we propose a novel first-order algorithm,
which we name Stochastic Approximate Mirror Descent. This algorithm combines
stochastic and approximate subgradient evaluations, together with mirror
descent update steps, which is provably efficient for the IO problems with high
cardinality discrete feasible sets. We implement the IO approaches developed in
this paper as a Python package called InvOpt. All of our numerical experiments

pushed to their limits of handling to achieve an optimal lap time; therefore,
vehicles exhibit highly nonlinear and complex dynamics. Difficult-to-model
effects, such as drifting, aerodynamics, chassis weight transfer, and
suspension can lead to infeasible and suboptimal trajectories. While offline
planning allows optimizing a full reference trajectory for the minimum lap time
objective, such modeling discrepancies are particularly detrimental when using
offline planning, as planning model errors compound with controller modeling
errors. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) can compensate for modeling errors.
However, previous works primarily focus on modeling error in real-time control
without consideration for how the model used in offline planning can affect the
overall performance. In this work, we propose a double-GPR error compensation
algorithm to reduce model uncertainties; specifically, we compensate both the
planner's model and controller's model with two respective GPR-based error
compensation functions. Furthermore, we design an iterative framework to
re-collect error-rich data using the racing control system. We test our method
in the high-fidelity racing simulator Gran Turismo Sport (GTS); we find that
our iterative, double-GPR compensation functions improve racing performance and
iteration stability in comparison to a single compensation function applied

metric, Wasserstein Distance based Joint Estimation (WDJE), for transferability
estimation and determination in a unified setting: classification and
regression problems with domain and task differences. The WDJE facilitates
decision-making on whether to transfer or not by comparing the target risk with

transfer risk by proposing a non-symmetric, easy-to-understand and
easy-to-calculate target risk bound that is workable even with limited target
labels. The proposed bound relates the target risk to source model performance,
domain and task differences based on Wasserstein distance. We also extend our

finite empirical samples. Our experiments in image classification and remaining
useful life regression prediction illustrate the effectiveness of the WDJE in

quasi-static limit of AeST can achieve precisely this, assuming that the vector
field $\vec{A}$ vanishes. However, this assumption of a vanishing vector field
is often inconsistent. Here, we show how to correctly take into account the
vector field and find that the quasi-static limit depends on a model parameter
$m_\times$. In the limit $m_\times \to 0$, one recovers the quasi-static limit
with a vanishing vector field. In particular, one finds a two-field version of
MOND. In the opposite limit, $m_\times \to \infty$, one finds a single-field
version of MOND. We show that, in practice, much of the phenomenology of the
quasi-static limit depends only very little on the value of $m_\times$. Still,
for some observational tests, such as those involving wide binaries, $m_\times$

that the third harmonic response of RF vortex nucleation caused by surface

find a sub-solar metallicity [M/H]=$-0.91^{+0.24}_{-0.16}$ and C/O ratio
$0.36^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$. We identify H$_2$O and CO and constrain their

they often struggle to produce coherent and fluent text when they are small.
Models with around 125M parameters such as GPT-Neo (small) or GPT-2 (small) can
rarely generate coherent and consistent English text beyond a few words even
after extensive training. This raises the question of whether the emergence of
the ability to produce coherent English text only occurs at larger scales (with
hundreds of millions of parameters or more) and complex architectures (with
many layers of global attention).
  In this work, we introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories
that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand,
generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train
and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below
10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one
transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with
several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and
demonstrate reasoning capabilities.
  We also introduce a new paradigm for the evaluation of language models: We
suggest a framework which uses GPT-4 to grade the content generated by these
models as if those were stories written by students and graded by a (human)
teacher. This new paradigm overcomes the flaws of standard benchmarks which
often requires the model's output to be very structures, and moreover provides
a multidimensional score for the model, providing scores for different
capabilities such as grammar, creativity and consistency.
  We hope that TinyStories can facilitate the development, analysis and
research of LMs, especially for low-resource or specialized domains, and shed
light on the emergence of language capabilities in LMs.

electromagnetic (EM) signal emitted by cataclysmic events involving the
formation or the merger of neutron stars (NSs). As such, SBOs carry unique
information on the structure of their progenitors and on the explosion energy.
The characteristic~SBO emission is expected in the UV range, and its detection
is one of the key targets of~the ULTRASAT satellite. Among SBO sources, we
focus on a specific class involving the formation of fast spinning magnetars in
the core-collapse (CC) of massive stars. Fast spinning magnetars are expected
to produce a specific signature in the early UV supernova light curve, powered
by the extra spin energy quickly released by the NS. Moreover, they are
considered as optimal candidates for the emission of long-transient
gravitational wave (GW) signals, the detection of which requires early EM
triggers to boost the sensitivity of dedicated GW search pipelines. We
calculate early supernova UV light curves in the presence of a magnetar central
engine, as a function of the explosion energy, ejecta mass and magnetar
parameters. We then estimate the ULTRASAT detection horizon (z < 0.15) as a
function of the same physical parameters, and the overall expected detection
rate finding that magnetar-powered SBOs may represent up to 1/5 of the total
events detected by ULTRASAT. Moreover, at the expected sensitivity of the
LIGO/Virgo/Kagra O5 science run, one such event occurring within 5 Mpc will
providean ideal trigger for a GW long transient search. Future GW detectors
like the Einstein Telescope will push the horizon for joint EM-GW detections to
35-40 Mpc.

the US Census Bureau has recently adopted differential privacy, the de facto
standard of privacy protection for the 2020 Census release. Enforcing
differential privacy involves adding carefully calibrated random noise to
sensitive demographic information prior to its release. This change has the
potential to impact policy decisions like political redistricting and other
high-stakes practices, partly because tremendous federal funds and resources
are allocated according to datasets (like Census data) released by the US

redrawing of school attendance boundaries to foster less demographically
segregated schools. In this study, we ask: how differential privacy might
impact diversity-promoting boundaries in terms of resulting levels of
segregation, student travel times, and school switching requirements?
Simulating alternative boundaries using differentially-private student counts
across 67 Georgia districts, we find that increasing data privacy requirements
decreases the extent to which alternative boundaries might reduce segregation
and foster more diverse and integrated schools, largely by reducing the number
of students who would switch schools under boundary changes. Impacts on travel
times are minimal. These findings point to a privacy-diversity tradeoff local
educational policymakers may face in forthcoming years, particularly as
computational methods are increasingly poised to facilitate attendance boundary
redrawings in the pursuit of less segregated schools.

  In this study, we address open questions of the Cucker--Smale model with

weight, {\bf (ii)} The convergence of the norm of the velocities of agents,
{\bf (iii)} The direction of the velocities of agents. For problems (i) and

models on the lifted versions (i.e., the specific Atomic Propositions (AP) are

aspects: 1) Usage of lifted NL-TL characterizes common logical structures,
without constraints of specific domains. 2) Application of LLMs in dataset
creation largely enhances corpus richness. We test the generalization of
trained models on five varied domains. To achieve full NL-TL transformation, we
either combine the lifted model with AP recognition task or do the further
finetuning on each specific domain. During the further finetuning, our model

improving to meet the increasing demands of modern data-intensive applications.
Unfortunately, communication between the SSD controller and memory chips (e.g.,
2D/3D NAND flash chips) is a critical performance bottleneck for many
applications. SSDs use a multi-channel shared bus architecture where multiple
memory chips connected to the same channel communicate to the SSD controller
with only one path. As a result, path conflicts often occur during the
servicing of multiple I/O requests, which significantly limits SSD parallelism.
It is critical to handle path conflicts well to improve SSD parallelism and
performance. Our goal is to fundamentally tackle the path conflict problem by
increasing the number of paths between the SSD controller and memory chips at
low cost. To this end, we build on the idea of using an interconnection network
to increase the path diversity between the SSD controller and memory chips. We
propose Venice, a new mechanism that introduces a low-cost interconnection
network between the SSD controller and memory chips and utilizes the path
diversity to intelligently resolve path conflicts. Venice employs three key
techniques: 1) a simple router chip added next to each memory chip without
modifying the memory chip design, 2) a path reservation technique that reserves
a path from the SSD controller to the target memory chip before initiating a
transfer, and 3) a fully-adaptive routing algorithm that effectively utilizes
the path diversity to resolve path conflicts. Our experimental results show
that Venice 1) improves performance by an average of 2.65x/1.67x over a
baseline performance-optimized/cost-optimized SSD design across a wide range of
workloads, 2) reduces energy consumption by an average of 61% compared to a
baseline performance-optimized SSD design.

by integrating the spectral information of a low-resolution multispectral

(SR) task that diverse HRMS images can degrade into an LRMS image. However,
existing deep learning-based methods recover only one HRMS image from the LRMS
image and PAN image using a deterministic mapping, thus ignoring the diversity
of the HRMS image. In this paper, to alleviate this ill-posed issue, we propose
a flow-based pan-sharpening network (PanFlowNet) to directly learn the
conditional distribution of HRMS image given LRMS image and PAN image instead
of learning a deterministic mapping. Specifically, we first transform this
unknown conditional distribution into a given Gaussian distribution by an
invertible network, and the conditional distribution can thus be explicitly
defined. Then, we design an invertible Conditional Affine Coupling Block (CACB)
and further build the architecture of PanFlowNet by stacking a series of CACBs.
Finally, the PanFlowNet is trained by maximizing the log-likelihood of the
conditional distribution given a training set and can then be used to predict
diverse HRMS images. The experimental results verify that the proposed
PanFlowNet can generate various HRMS images given an LRMS image and a PAN
image. Additionally, the experimental results on different kinds of satellite

a scientifically competitive instrument 130 to 175 m in size can be developed
in a more cost effective manner. We then present an antenna configuration

high-density gas in the cloud which allows to constrain the formation scenario
of the high-mass star forming DR21 ridge. The molecular line data reveals that
the sub-filaments are systematically redshifted relative to the dense ridge. We
demonstrate that [CII] unveils the surrounding CO-poor gas of the dense
filaments in the DR21 cloud. We also show that this surrounding gas is
organized in a flattened cloud with curved redshifted dynamics perpendicular to
the ridge. The sub-filaments thus form in this curved and flattened mass
reservoir. A virial analysis of the different lines indicates that self-gravity
should drive the evolution of the ridge and surrounding cloud. Combining all
results we propose that bending of the magnetic field, due to the interaction
with a mostly atomic colliding cloud, explains the velocity field and resulting
mass accretion on the ridge. This is remarkably similar to what was found for
at least two nearby low-mass filaments. We tentatively propose that this
scenario might be a widespread mechanism to initiate star formation in the
Milky Way. However, in contrast to low-mass clouds, gravitational collapse
plays a role on the pc scale of the DR21 ridge because of the higher density.
This allows more effective mass collection at the centers of collapse and
should facilitate massive cluster formation.

$\Psi$-factorizability to study nearby cycles over general bases, whereby a
sheaf is $\Psi$-factorizable if its nearby cycles are the same as iterated
nearby cycles with respect to arbitrary compositions of specializations on the
base. The Satake sheaves on Beilinson-Drinfeld grassmannians and their
cohomology sheaves on curves are nontrivial examples of $\Psi$-factorizable
sheaves. This notion allows us to adapt arguments from Xue. As an application,
for certain automorphic forms in depth zero attached to a Langlands parameter,
we characterize the image of the tame generator of this parameter in terms of
semisimple orbits and two-sided cells attached to representations, extending
ideas of Lusztig-Yun and Bezrukavnikov-Finkelberg-Ostrik.

  Execution",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dominant paradigm of textual question answering systems is based on
end-to-end neural networks, which excels at answering natural language
questions but falls short on complex ones. This stands in contrast to the broad
adaptation of semantic parsing approaches over structured data sources (e.g.,
relational database, knowledge graphs), that convert natural language questions
to logical forms and execute them with query engines. Towards combining the
strengths of neural and symbolic methods, we propose a framework of question
parsing and execution on textual QA. It comprises two central pillars: (1) We
parse the question of varying complexity into an intermediate representation,
named H-expression, which is composed of simple questions as the primitives and
symbolic operations representing the relationships among them; (2) To execute
the resulting H-expressions, we design a hybrid executor, which integrates the
deterministic rules to translate the symbolic operations with a drop-in neural
reader network to answer each decomposed simple question. Hence, the proposed
framework can be viewed as a top-down question parsing followed by a bottom-up
answer backtracking. The resulting H-expressions closely guide the execution
process, offering higher precision besides better interpretability while still
preserving the advantages of the neural readers for resolving its primitive
elements. Our extensive experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiQA, HotpotQA, and NQ show
that the proposed parsing and hybrid execution framework outperforms existing
approaches in supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while also
effectively exposing its underlying reasoning process.

corrosion resistance required for extreme operating conditions such as high
temperature. The change in microstructure due to composition and process
variations is expected to impact material properties. Identifying
microstructural features such as grain boundaries thus becomes an important
task in the process-microstructure-properties loop. Applying convolutional
neural network (CNN) based deep-learning models is a powerful technique to
detect features from material micrographs in an automated manner. Manual
labeling of the images for the segmentation task poses a major bottleneck for
generating training data and labels in a reliable and reproducible way within a
reasonable timeframe. In this study, we attempt to overcome such limitations by
utilizing multi-modal microscopy to generate labels directly instead of manual
labeling. We combine scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 347H
stainless steel as training data and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
micrographs as pixel-wise labels for grain boundary detection as a semantic
segmentation task. We demonstrate that despite producing instrumentation drift
during data collection between two modes of microscopy, this method performs
comparably to similar segmentation tasks that used manual labeling.
Additionally, we find that na\""ive pixel-wise segmentation results in small
gaps and missing boundaries in the predicted grain boundary map. By
incorporating topological information during model training, the connectivity
of the grain boundary network and segmentation performance is improved.
Finally, our approach is validated by accurate computation on downstream tasks
of predicting the underlying grain morphology distributions which are the
ultimate quantities of interest for microstructural characterization.

contradictory results can still be found. Here, I take a step further to treat
the scenarios in full relational language by using knowledge operators. I show
that trust is equivalent to the Truth Axiom and by rewriting the

contextuality can be understood as the violation of soundness by supposing
mutual knowledge. Loosening this condition by assuming distributed knowledge
eliminates such violations but at the cost of lambda dependence. Finally, the

HOOPE-EnKF over traditional EnKFs is that its performance is not greatly

learning rate, the largest learning rate for which the mean squared change in
pre-activations after one step of gradient descent remains uniformly bounded at
large $n,L$. As in prior work on $\mu$P of Yang et. al., we find that this
maximal update learning rate is independent of $n$ for all but the first and

$L$, scaling like $L^{-3/2}.$

covariance parameters, 2) estimating fixed effects, 3) kriging (making point
predictions), and 4) block-kriging (predicting the average value over a
region). Each of these goals can present different challenges when analyzing
large spatial data sets. Current research uses a variety of methods, including
spatial basis functions (reduced rank), covariance tapering, etc, to achieve
these goals. However, spatial indexing, which is very similar to composite
likelihood, offers some advantages. We develop a simple framework for all four
goals listed above by using indexing to create a block covariance structure and
nearest-neighbor predictions while maintaining a coherent linear model. We show
exact inference for fixed effects under this block covariance construction.
Spatial indexing is very fast, and simulations are used to validate methods and
compare to another popular method. We study various sample designs for indexing
and our simulations showed that indexing leading to spatially compact
partitions are best over a range of sample sizes, autocorrelation values, and
generating processes. Partitions can be kept small, on the order of 50 samples
per partition. We use nearest-neighbors for kriging and block kriging, finding
that 50 nearest-neighbors is sufficient. In all cases, confidence intervals for
fixed effects, and prediction intervals for (block) kriging, have appropriate
coverage. Some advantages of spatial indexing are that it is available for any
valid covariance matrix, can take advantage of parallel computing, and easily
extends to non-Euclidean topologies, such as stream networks. We use stream
networks to show how spatial indexing can achieve all four goals, listed above,
for very large data sets, in a matter of minutes, rather than days, for an
example data set.

separate single-task models on edge devices is inefficient regarding the
required computational resource and time. In this context, multi-task learning
allows leveraging a single deep learning model for performing multiple tasks,
such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation on incoming video frames.
This single processing pipeline generates common deep features that are shared
among multi-task modules. However, in a collaborative intelligence scenario,
generating common deep features has two major issues. First, the deep features
may inadvertently contain input information exposed to the downstream modules
(violating input privacy). Second, the generated universal features expose a
piece of collective information than what is intended for a certain task, in
which features for one task can be utilized to perform another task (violating
task privacy). This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based
privacy-cognizant feature generation process called MetaMorphosis that limits
inference capability to specific tasks at hand. To achieve this, we propose a
channel squeeze-excitation based feature metamorphosis module, Cross-SEC, to
achieve distinct attention of all tasks and a de-correlation loss function with
differential-privacy to train a deep learning model that produces distinct
privacy-aware features as an output for the respective tasks. With extensive

associated with more severe outcomes than non-immunosuppressed hosts. However,
exactly which risk factors cause Long COVID in acute COVID cases remains
unknown. More importantly, the impact of Long COVID on patient survival remains
understudied, especially when examined alongside the effect of SOT. All
patients have been identified with acute COVID in the National COVID
Collaborative Cohort registry. We compared patient demographics in Long COVID
vs. those without Long COVID based on descriptive statistics. Multivariable
logistics regressions were used to determine the factors related to the
likelihood of developing Long COVID from a case of acute COVID. Multi-variables
Cox regression was used to determine the time-to-event outcome of patient
survival with Long COVID. This study reviewed data from a cohort of 6,416,500
acute COVID patients. Of that group, 31,744 patients developed Long COVID from
ICD diagnosis. The mean (q1, q3) age was 39 (22, 57) years old, and 55% of
patients were female. From this cohort, a total of 31,744 (1%) developed Long
COVID and 43,565 (1%) had SOT, with a total of 698 SOT patients identified with
Long COVID. Mean age of those with Long COVID was 52 (39, 64) years old and 64%

recipients. From the Cox regression analysis of patient survival, there were
many significant factors related to patient survival, with elderly SOT patients
having a much higher hazard ratio of 27.8 (26.3, 29.4). This study has
identified the important risk factors that are more likely to cause Long COVID

a challenging task in full generality because there are many possible
integration of DERs in foresight. That is, there are numerous extreme points
between feasible and infeasible sets. Moreover, HC depends on multiple factors
such as (a) adoption patterns of DERs that depend on socio-economic behaviors
and (b) how DERs are controlled and managed. These two factors are intrinsic to
the problem space because not all integration of DERs may be centrally planned,

a few most insightful HC scenarios at the cost of domain knowledge. We propose

naturally-occurring-oscillating ASF induced by longitudinal-corrugated surface
in TCF(TCFLongitudinal) and increasing trend on its magnitude with Reynolds
number (Re) results in the occurrence of drag reduction. This has motivated us
to study the possibility of enhancing drag reduction by maintaining a
consistently increasing trend with Re in the magnitude of
naturally-occurring-oscillating ASF induced by the helical-corrugated surface
on the stationary outer cylinder in TCF. From flow structures, steady ASF with
non-zero mean is observed at Re=60 which suppresses the strength of azimuthal
vorticities for Re>85 and contributed to occurrence of drag reduction. As Re is
increased to 100,90 and 85 for P* =1,2, and 3, respectively, formation of
periodic oscillating ASF with non-zero mean and its increasing trend in
magnitude with Re suppresses azimuthal vorticities further which contributes to
the maximum drag reduction of 13%. For Re>165,145 and 140 for P*=1,2 and 3,
respectively, non-periodic oscillating ASF is observed, and its magnitude
remains nearly unchanged or decreases slightly with Re which results in the
suppression effect of azimuthal vortices to be weaker. This results in decrease
in drag reduction. Oscillating ASF observed in TCFHelical is found to occur at
earlier Re and it is stronger than that of TCFLongitudinal which contributes to
occurrence of higher drag reduction in TCFHelical.

investigated. By using magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, magnet particles are
dispersed in a two-dimensional cell without physical contact between them. In
this magnetic system, bidispersity is introduced by mixing large and small
magnets. Then, the particle system is compressed to produce a uniform particle
configuration. The compressed particle configuration is analyzed by using
Voronoi tessellation for evaluating the disorder degree which strongly depends
on bidispersity. Specifically, standard deviation and skewness of the Voronoi
cell area distribution are measured. As a result, we find that the peak of
standard deviation is observed when the numbers of large and small particles
are almost identical. Although the skewness shows non-monotonic behavior, zero
skewness state (symmetric distribution) can be achieved when the numbers of
large and small particles are identical. In this ideally random (disordered)

diagnostic goal is to identify electrical triggers or drivers of heart rhythm
disorders. However, using electrical mapping techniques, it is currently
impossible to map the three-dimensional morphology of the electrical waves
throughout the entire heart muscle, especially during ventricular arrhythmias.
Therefore, the approach to calculate or predict electrical excitation from the
hearts motion could be a promising alternative diagnostic approach. Here, we
demonstrate in computer simulations that it is possible to predict
three-dimensional electrical wave dynamics from ventricular deformation
mechanics using deep learning. We performed thousands of simulations of
electromechanical activation dynamics in ventricular geometries and used the
data to train a neural network which subsequently predicts the
three-dimensional electrical wave pattern that caused the deformation. We
demonstrate that, next to focal wave patterns, even complicated
three-dimensional electrical wave patterns can be reconstructed, even if the
network has never seen the particular arrhythmia. We show that the deep
learning model has the ability to generalize by training it on data generated
with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and subsequently applying
it to data generated with the finite element method (FEM). Predictions can be
performed in the presence of scars and with significant heterogeneity. Our
results suggest that, deep neural networks could be used to calculate

machines using only a few normal samples, without the need for hyperparameter
tuning. In the past ASD tasks, developed methods tuned hyperparameters for each
machine type, as the development and evaluation datasets had the same machine
types. However, collecting normal and anomalous data as the development dataset
can be infeasible in practice. In 2023 Task 2, we focus on solving first-shot

completely novel machine type. Specifically, (i) each machine type has only one
section, and (ii) machine types in the development and evaluation datasets are
completely different. We will add challenge results and analysis of the

we can enhance or suppress wave scattering to filter out unwanted waves and
allow the robust coherent transmission of waves at specific angles and

a new approach for creating selective transparency, band gaps and anisotropy in

infancy and not fully investigated. In this paper, we conduct multi-scenario
broadband channel measurements and modeling for RIS-assisted communications at
the sub-6 GHz band. The measurements are carried out in three scenarios
covering outdoor, indoor, and outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) environments, which
suffer from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation inherently. Three propagation
modes including intelligent reflection with RIS, specular reflection with RIS
and the mode without RIS, are taken into account in each scenario. In addition,
considering the cascaded characteristics of RIS-assisted channel by nature, two
modified empirical models including floating-intercept (FI) and close-in (CI)
are proposed, which cover distance and angle domains. The measurement results
rooted in 2096 channel acquisitions verify the prediction accuracy of these
proposed models. Moreover, the propagation characteristics for RIS-assisted
channels, including path loss (PL) gain, PL exponent, spatial consistency, time
dispersion, frequency stationarity, etc., are compared and analyzed
comprehensively. These channel measurement and modeling results may lay the

aggregates multiple client models trained on heterogeneous data to obtain a
well-performed global model. However, the rationale behind its success is not
well understood. To shed light on this issue, we investigate the geometric
properties of model averaging by visualizing the loss/error landscape. The
geometrical visualization shows that the client models surround the global
model within a common basin, and the global model may deviate from the bottom
of the basin even though it performs better than the client models. To further
understand this phenomenon, we decompose the expected prediction error of the
global model into five factors related to client models. Specifically, we find
that the global-model error after early training mainly comes from i) the
client-model error on non-overlapping data between client datasets and the
global dataset and ii) the maximal distance between the global and client
models. Inspired by these findings, we propose adopting iterative moving
averaging (IMA) on global models to reduce the prediction error and limiting
client exploration to control the maximal distance at the late training. Our
experiments demonstrate that IMA significantly improves the accuracy and
training speed of existing FL methods on benchmark datasets with various data

difficult to compare them against disclosure risk measures which are usually

evaluated over multiple masked datasets, generated by the application of
increasing amounts of perturbation (e.g., by adding increasing amounts of

event-based works use deep learning to estimate optical flow. However, their
networks have not fully exploited prior hidden states and motion flows.
Additionally, their supervision strategy has not fully leveraged the geometric
constraints of event data to unlock the potential of networks. In this paper,
we propose EV-MGRFlowNet, an unsupervised event-based optical flow estimation

multi-level motion features. Then, we propose a flow-guided decoder network

more accurate alignment of events. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the MVSEC dataset,

develop accurate and reliable predictive models. However, stringent data
privacy laws and the abundance of edge industrial data necessitate
decentralized data utilization. Thus, the industrial health prognostics field
is well suited to significantly benefit from federated learning (FL), a
decentralized and privacy-preserving learning technique. However, FL-based
health prognostics tasks have hardly been investigated due to the complexities
of meaningfully aggregating model parameters trained from heterogeneous data to
form a high performing federated model. Specifically, data heterogeneity among
edge devices, stemming from dissimilar degradation mechanisms and unequal
dataset sizes, poses a critical statistical challenge for developing accurate
federated models. We propose a pioneering FL-based health prognostic model with
a feature similarity-matched parameter aggregation algorithm to
discriminatingly learn from heterogeneous edge data. The algorithm searches
across the heterogeneous locally trained models and matches neurons with
probabilistically similar feature extraction functions first, before
selectively averaging them to form the federated model parameters. As the
algorithm only averages similar neurons, as opposed to conventional naive
averaging of coordinate-wise neurons, the distinct feature extractors of local
models are carried over with less dilution to the resultant federated model.
Using both cyclic degradation data of Li-ion batteries and non-cyclic data of
turbofan engines, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields accuracy
improvements as high as 44.5\% and 39.3\% for state-of-health estimation and
remaining useful life estimation, respectively.

advantage of the frequency- and time-domain representations of audio signals.
We modify the target network, i.e., the network architecture of the original
DNN-based MSS, by adding bridging paths for each output instrument to share
their information. MDL is then applied to the combinations of the output
sources as well as each independent source, hence we called it CL. MDL and CL
can easily be applied to many DNN-based separation methods as they are merely
loss functions that are only used during training and do not affect the
inference step. Bridging operation does not increase the number of learnable
parameters in the network. Experimental results showed that the validity of

while trying to better remove objects using their networks, the previous works

on generating the input mask to better remove objects using the off-the-shelf

the explainable AI (XAI) method, whose output can better remove objects than a
semantic segmentation mask. The proposed method generates an importance map
using randomly sampled input masks and quantitatively estimated scores of the
completed images obtained from the random masks. The output mask is selected by
a judge module among the candidate masks which are generated from the
importance map. We design the judge module to quantitatively estimate the

the evaluation methods used in the previous works reporting object removal

the meridional circulation is the same in every setup. The planetary spiral
wakes drive a vertical stirring inside the protoplanetary disc and the
encounter with these shock fronts also helps in delivering gas vertically onto
the Hill-sphere. The accretion dynamics are unchanged: the planet accretes
vertically, and there is outflow in the midplane regions inside the
Hill-sphere. We determined the effective $\alpha$-viscosity generated in the
disc by the various angular momentum loss mechanisms, which showed that
magnetic fields produce high turbulence in the ideal MHD limit, that grows from
$\alpha \sim 10^{-2.5}$ up to $\sim 10^{-1.5}$ after the planet spirals
develop. In the HD simulations, the planetary spirals contribute to $\alpha
\sim 10^{-3}$, making this a very important angular momentum transport
mechanism. Due to the various $\alpha$ values in the different setups, the gap
opening is different in each case. In the radiative MHD setups, the high
turbulent viscosity prevents gap opening, leading to a higher Hill mass, and no
clear dust trapping regions. While the Hill accretion rate is $10^{-6}
\rm{M_{Jup}/yr}$ in all setups, the accretion variability is orders of
magnitude higher in radiative runs than in isothermal ones. Finally, with
higher-resolution runs, the magneto-rotational instability started to be

to the non-zero entries of its base matrix. Yet, to achieve the channel
capacity with uniform power allocation, the coupling width and the coupling
length of the base matrix must satisfy regularity conditions and tend to
infinity as the rate approaches the capacity. For a base matrix with a pair of
finite and arbitrarily chosen coupling width and coupling length, we propose a
novel power allocation policy, termed V-power allocation. V-power allocation
puts more power to the outer columns of the base matrix to jumpstart the
decoding process and less power to the inner columns, resembling the shape of
the letter V. We show that V-power allocation outperforms uniform power
allocation since it ensures successful decoding for a wider range of

to measurement matrices with independent and identically distributed (IID)

which has been proven to be replica Bayes optimal in uncoded GLS. However, the
information-theoretic limit of GOAMP/GVAMP is still an open challenge for
arbitrary input distributions due to its complex state evolution (SE). To
address this issue, in this paper, we provide the achievable rate analysis of
GOAMP/GVAMP in GLS, establishing its information-theoretic limit (i.e., maximum

(SE) of GOAMP/GVAMP into an equivalent single-input single-output variational
SE (VSE). Using the VSE and the mutual information and minimum mean-square

the optimal coding principle for maximizing the achievable rate is proposed,

Numerical results verify the achievable rate advantages of GOAMP/GVAMP over the

and controllability against malicious attacks. This kind of network robustness
is typically measured by the time-consuming attack simulation, which returns a
sequence of values that record the remaining connectivity and controllability
after a sequence of node- or edge-removal attacks. For improvement, this paper
develops an efficient framework for network robustness prediction, the spatial
pyramid pooling convolutional neural network (SPP-CNN). The new framework
installs a spatial pyramid pooling layer between the convolutional and
fully-connected layers, overcoming the common mismatch issue in the CNN-based
prediction approaches and extending its generalizability. Extensive experiments
are carried out by comparing SPP-CNN with three state-of-the-art robustness
predictors, namely a CNN-based and two graph neural networks-based frameworks.
Synthetic and real-world networks, both directed and undirected, are
investigated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SPP-CNN
achieves better prediction performances and better generalizability to unknown
datasets, with significantly lower time-consumption, than its counterparts.

weakly-hard real-time constraints. Various approaches for stability analysis

from other dimension reduction approaches as it utilises a shape-signature

efficiently and effectively find an optimal design in appropriate areas of the

a ferroelectric and ferromagnet, often coupled interfacially by
magnetostriction induced by the lattice elongations in the ferroelectric. In
BaTiO3 the magnitude of strain induced by these elongations is heavily
temperature dependent, varying greatly between each of the polar crystal phases
and exerting a huge influence over the properties of a coupled magnetic film.
Here we demonstrate that temperature, and thus strain, is an effective means of
controlling the magnetic anisotropy in BaTiO3(111)/CoFeB heterostructures. We
investigate the three polar phases of BaTiO3: tetragonal (T) at room
temperature, orthorhombic (O) below 280 K and rhombohedral (R) below 190 K,
across a total range of 77 K to 420 K. We find two distinct responses; a
step-like change in the anisotropy across the low-temperature phase
transitions, and a sharp high-temperature reduction around the ferroelectric
Curie temperature, measured from hard axis hysteresis loops. Using our
measurements of this anisotropy strength we are then able to show by
micromagnetic simulation the behaviour of all possible magnetic domain wall
states and determine their scaling as a function of temperature. The most
significant changes occur in the head-to-head domain wall states, with a
maximum change of 210 nm predicted across the entire range effectively doubling
the size of the domain wall as compared to room temperature. Notably, similar
changes are seen for both high and low temperatures which suggest different
routes for potential control of magnetic anisotropy and elastically pinned
magnetic domain walls.

  Similarity",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  One of the components of natural language processing that has received a lot
of investigation recently is semantic textual similarity. In computational
linguistics and natural language processing, assessing the semantic similarity
of words, phrases, paragraphs, and texts is crucial. Calculating the degree of
semantic resemblance between two textual pieces, paragraphs, or phrases
provided in both monolingual and cross-lingual versions is known as semantic
similarity. Cross lingual semantic similarity requires corpora in which there
are sentence pairs in both the source and target languages with a degree of
semantic similarity between them. Many existing cross lingual semantic
similarity models use a machine translation due to the unavailability of cross
lingual semantic similarity dataset, which the propagation of the machine
translation error reduces the accuracy of the model. On the other hand, when we
want to use semantic similarity features for machine translation the same
machine translations should not be used for semantic similarity. For Persian,
which is one of the low resource languages, no effort has been made in this
regard and the need for a model that can understand the context of two
languages is felt more than ever. In this article, the corpus of semantic
textual similarity between sentences in Persian and English languages has been
produced for the first time by using linguistic experts. We named this dataset
PESTS (Persian English Semantic Textual Similarity). This corpus contains 5375
sentence pairs. Also, different models based on transformers have been
fine-tuned using this dataset. The results show that using the PESTS dataset,
the Pearson correlation of the XLM ROBERTa model increases from 85.87% to
95.62%.

increasingly, as they can be trained to be robust to the material being
analysed and resilient towards poor image quality. Unfortunately, most recent
and popular DL models have been developed for 2D image processing, thereby
disregarding valuable volumetric information.
  This study revisits recent supervised (UNet, UNet++, UNet 3+, MSS-UNet) and
unsupervised (VAE, ceVAE, gmVAE, vqVAE) DL models for porosity analysis of AM
samples from X-CT images and extends them to accept 3D input data with a
3D-patch pipeline for lower computational requirements, improved efficiency and
generalisability. The supervised models were trained using the Focal Tversky
loss to address class imbalance that arises from the low porosity in the
training datasets. The output of the unsupervised models is post-processed to
reduce misclassifications caused by their inability to adequately represent the
object surface. The findings were cross-validated in a 5-fold fashion and
include: a performance benchmark of the DL models, an evaluation of the
post-processing algorithm, an evaluation of the effect of training supervised
models with the output of unsupervised models. In a final performance benchmark
on a test set with poor image quality, the best performing supervised model was
MSS-UNet with an average precision of 0.808 $\pm$ 0.013, while the best
unsupervised model was the post-processed ceVAE with 0.935 $\pm$ 0.001. The

combined the air-based and water-based metafluids to realize an exponential

By cooperatively adjusting the sound velocity and thickness in the matching
layers, we modulated the required acoustic parameters of each layer into a
reasonable range, which can be conveniently achieved by the proposed

tank. Experimental results show that the proposed matching layer can achieve an

demonstrate a multicolor picture transmission from air to water, which shows
extremely high communication capacity and accuracy. Our work is promising for
more applications based on water-air transmission and opens a new avenue to the

part because of the inherently effectful nature of the parsers being composed

address these challenges by defining a parser combinator framework called
Morpheus equipped with abstractions for defining composable effects tailored
for parsing and semantic actions and a rich specification language used to
define safety properties over the constituent parsers comprising a program.
Even though its abstractions yield many of the same expressivity benefits as

substantially more tractable automated verification pathway. We demonstrate its
utility in verifying a number of realistic, challenging parsing applications,

parameters; the bar length for non-AGN galaxies and the bar axis ratio for
AGN-hosting galaxies. Our analysis confirms that barred galaxies have a higher
specific SF rate than unbarred control galaxies. Moreover, we find a positive
correlation of bar length with both the SF enhancement and the centrally
star-forming galaxy fraction, indicating the interconnectivity of bars and SF

for Semantics Completion (MASCOT) based on semantic-based masked modeling.
Specifically, after applying attention-based video masking to generate

to recover masked semantics information. The recovery mechanism is achieved by
aligning the masked content with the unmasked visual regions and corresponding
textual context, which makes the model capture more text-related details at a
patch level. Additionally, we shift the emphasis of reconstruction from
irrelevant backgrounds to discriminative parts to ignore regions with
low-informed masks. Furthermore, we design dual-mask co-learning to incorporate

reasoning at known timestamps to complete the missing part of facts and has
attracted more and more attention in recent years. Most existing methods focus
on learning representations based on graph neural networks while inaccurately
extracting information from timestamps and insufficiently utilizing the implied
information in relations. To address these problems, we propose a novel TKGC
model, namely Pre-trained Language Model with Prompts for TKGC (PPT). We
convert a series of sampled quadruples into pre-trained language model inputs
and convert intervals between timestamps into different prompts to make
coherent sentences with implicit semantic information. We train our model with
a masking strategy to convert TKGC task into a masked token prediction task,
which can leverage the semantic information in pre-trained language models.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets and extensive analysis demonstrate that
our model has great competitiveness compared to other models with four metrics.
Our model can effectively incorporate information from temporal knowledge
graphs into the language models.

models of the subsurface. However, estimating the associated uncertainties in
the process is not trivial. Commonly, uncertainty estimation is performed
within the Bayesian framework through sampling algorithms to estimate the
posterior distribution and identify the associated uncertainty. Nevertheless,
such an approach has to deal with complex posterior structures (e.g.,
multimodality), high-dimensional model parameters, and large-scale datasets,
which lead to high computational demands and time-consuming procedures. As a
result, uncertainty analysis is rarely performed, especially at the industrial
scale, and thus, it drives practitioners away from utilizing it for
decision-making. This work proposes a frugal approach to estimate uncertainty
in FWI through the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm by
utilizing a relatively small number of velocity model particles. We warm-start
the SVGD algorithm by perturbing the optimized velocity model obtained from a
deterministic FWI procedure with random field-based perturbations. Such
perturbations cover the scattering (i.e., high wavenumber) and the transmission
(i.e., low wavenumber) components of FWI and, thus, represent the uncertainty
of the FWI holistically. We demonstrate the proposed approach on the Marmousi
model; we have learned that by utilizing a relatively small number of
particles, the uncertainty map presents qualitatively reliable information that
honours the physics of wave propagation at a reasonable cost, allowing for the
potential for industrial-scale applications. Nevertheless, given that
uncertainties are underestimated, we must be careful when incorporating them
into downstream tasks of seismic-driven geological and reservoir modelling.

pretraining objectives which might not be relevant to some downstream tasks and
hence result in substantial performance degrade. To address these limitations,
we propose ``CodeT5+'', a family of encoder-decoder LLMs for code in which
component modules can be flexibly combined to suit a wide range of downstream

of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and $HfO_{2}$ on Au-supported monolayer (1L) $MoS_{2}$ is
investigated, providing an insight on the nucleation mechanisms in the early
stages of the ALD process. A preliminary multiscale characterization of large
area 1L-$MoS_{2}$ exfoliated on sputter-grown Au/Ni films revealed an almost
conformal $MoS_{2}$ membrane with the Au topography and the occurrence of
strain variations at the nanoscale. Ab-initio DFT calculations of
$MoS_{2}$/Au(111) interface showed a significant influence of the Au substrate
on the $MoS_{2}$ energy band structure, whereas small differences were
accounted for the adsorption of the $H_{2}O$, TMA and TDMAHf precursors. This
suggests a crucial role of nanoscale morphological effects, such as local
curvature and strain of the $MoS_{2}$ membrane, in the enhanced physisorption
of the precursors. Therefore, the nucleation and growth of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and
$HfO_{2}$ films onto 1L-$MoS_{2}$/Au was investigated, by monitoring the
surface coverage as a function of the number (N) of ALD cycles, with N from 10
to 120. At low N values, a slower growth rate of the initially formed nuclei
was observed for $HfO_{2}$, probably due to the bulky nature of the TDMAHf
precursor as compared to TMA. On the other hand, the formation of continuous
films was obtained in both cases for N>80 ALD cycles, corresponding to 3.6 nm
$Al_{2}O_{3}$ and 3.1 nm $HfO_{2}$. Current mapping by C-AFM showed, for the
same applied bias, a uniform insulating behavior of $Al_{2}O_{3}$ and the
occurrence of few localized breakdown spots in the case of $HfO_{2}$,
associated to less compact films regions. Finally, an increase of the
1L-$MoS_{2}$ tensile strain was observed by Raman mapping after encapsulation
with both high-k films, accompanied by a reduction in the PL intensity.

unleashing the full potential of 360-degree virtual reality (VR). However, the
explosive growth of VR services, coupled with the reliability issues of mmWave
communications, poses enormous challenges in terms of wireless resource and
quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning for mmWave-enabled 360-degree VR. In this
paper, we propose an innovative 360-degree VR streaming architecture that
addresses three under-exploited issues: overlapping field-of-views (FoVs),
statistical QoS provisioning (SQP), and loss-tolerant active data discarding.
Specifically, an overlapping FoV-based optimal joint unicast and multicast
(JUM) task assignment scheme is designed to implement the non-redundant task
assignments, thereby conserving wireless resources remarkably. Furthermore,
leveraging stochastic network calculus, we develop a comprehensive SQP
theoretical framework that encompasses two SQP schemes from delay and rate
perspectives. Additionally, a corresponding optimal adaptive joint time-slot
allocation and active-discarding (ADAPT-JTAAT) transmission scheme is proposed
to minimize resource consumption while guaranteeing diverse statistical QoS
requirements under loss-intolerant and loss-tolerant scenarios from delay and
rate perspectives, respectively. Extensive simulations demonstrate the
effectiveness of the designed overlapping FoV-based JUM optimal task assignment
scheme. Comparisons with six baseline schemes validate that the proposed
optimal ADAPTJTAAT transmission scheme can achieve superior SQP performance in
resource utilization, flexible rate control, and robust queue behaviors.

reported Mn-based SAzymes, however, the multi-enzyme mimicking catalytic

combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML)

measurement tasks, particularly those with limited computing resources and
storage capacities. Existing binary descriptors may not perform well for
long-term visual measurement tasks due to their sensitivity to illumination
variations. It can be observed that when image illumination changes
dramatically, the relative relationship among local patches mostly remains
intact. Based on the observation, consequently, this study presents an
illumination-insensitive binary (IIB) descriptor by leveraging the local
inter-patch invariance exhibited in multiple spatial granularities to deal with
unfavorable illumination variations. By taking advantage of integral images for
local patch feature computation, a highly efficient IIB descriptor is achieved.
It can encode scalable features in multiple spatial granularities, thus
facilitating a computationally efficient hierarchical matching from coarse to
fine. Moreover, the IIB descriptor can also apply to other types of image data,
such as depth maps and semantic segmentation results, when available in some
applications. Numerical experiments on both natural and synthetic datasets
reveal that the proposed IIB descriptor outperforms state-of-the-art binary
descriptors and some testing float descriptors. The proposed IIB descriptor has
also been successfully employed in a demo system for long-term visual

account non-equilibrium effects associated to bulk viscosity that may be

framework, the existence of a quasi de-Sitter universe emerges as a natural
consequence of the presence of bulk viscosity, without requiring to introduce
additional scalar fields. As a result, the equation of state, determined by
numerically solving the generalized momentum-conservation equation involving

timescale characterising its departure from an exact de-Sitter phase is
intricately related to the magnitude of the bulk viscosity. We examine the

acoustic features as input, then passes the output of this network through two
parallel linear convolution layers respectively, and finally integrates into a
phase calculation formula to estimate frame-level phase spectra. Finally, the
outputs of ASP and PSP are combined to reconstruct speech waveforms by inverse

performed at the frame level. We train the ASP and PSP jointly and define
multilevel loss functions based on amplitude mean square error, phase
anti-wrapping error, short-time spectral inconsistency error and time domain

different ways by which a ring can be brought from rest to rotational motion,
whether by keeping the rest lengths of the blocks constituting the ring
constant or by keeping their lengths in the inertial frame constant, are
explored and their effect on the length of the material ring in the inertial as

confinement sustain flat galactic rotation curves without dark matter?"" The
article employs two methods to investigate whether non-perturbative corrections
from General Relativity are important for galactic rotation curves, and
concludes that they are not. This contradicts a series of articles [2-4] that
had determined that such corrections are large. We comment here that Ref. [1]
use approximations known to exclude the specific mechanism studied in [2-4] and
therefore is not testing the finding of Refs. [2-4].

impressive and far-reaching. However, the deployment of ML models is still
impaired by a lack of trust in how the best-performing ML models make
predictions. The issue of lack of trust is even more acute in the uses of ML
models in high-risk or safety-critical domains. eXplainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) is at the core of ongoing efforts for delivering trustworthy
AI. Unfortunately, XAI is riddled with critical misconceptions, that foster
distrust instead of building trust. This paper details some of the most visible
misconceptions in XAI, and shows how formal methods have been used, both to
disprove those misconceptions, but also to devise practically effective
alternatives.

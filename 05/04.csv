assess the impact of placing healthy individuals in quarantine and isolating
infected ones on the number of hospitalization and intensive care unit cases.
The proposed model is fully analyzed in order to prove the positivity of
solutions, to study the local and global stability of the disease-free
equilibria and to drive the basic and control reproduction numbers of the
model. Oman COVID-19 data is used to calibrate the model and estimate the
parameters. In particular, the published data for the year 2020 is used, when
two waves of the disease hit the country. Moreover, this period of time is
chosen when no vaccine had been introduced, but only the non-pharmaceutical
intervention (NPI) strategies were the only effective methods to control the
spread and, consequently, control the hospitalization cases to avoid pressuring
the health system. Based on the estimated parameters, the reproduction number
and contribution of different transmission routes are approximated numerically.
Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the significant parameters in
spreading the disease. Numerical simulation is carried out to demonstrate the
effects of quarantine and isolation on the number of hospitalized cases.

time-consuming and expensive. To alleviate the problem, it might be possible to
generate long-document QA pairs via unsupervised question answering (UQA)
methods. However, existing UQA tasks are based on short documents, and can
hardly incorporate long-range information. To tackle the problem, we propose a
new task, named unsupervised long-document question answering (ULQA), aiming to
generate high-quality long-document QA instances in an unsupervised manner.
Besides, we propose AttenWalker, a novel unsupervised method to aggregate and
generate answers with long-range dependency so as to construct long-document QA
pairs. Specifically, AttenWalker is composed of three modules, i.e., span
collector, span linker and answer aggregator. Firstly, the span collector takes
advantage of constituent parsing and reconstruction loss to select informative
candidate spans for constructing answers. Secondly, by going through the
attention graph of a pre-trained long-document model, potentially interrelated
text spans (that might be far apart) could be linked together via an
attention-walking algorithm. Thirdly, in the answer aggregator, linked spans
are aggregated into the final answer via the mask-filling ability of a
pre-trained model. Extensive experiments show that AttenWalker outperforms
previous methods on Qasper and NarrativeQA. In addition, AttenWalker also shows
strong performance in the few-shot learning setting.

solid crystals, acoustic waves, photonic materials and cold atoms. These
effects are characterized by `topological invariants' which are typically
integer-valued, and lead to robust quantized channels of transport in space,
time, and other degrees of freedom. The temporal channel, in particular, allows
one to achieve higher-dimensional topological effects, by driving the system
with multiple incommensurate frequencies. However, dissipation is generally
detrimental to such topological effects, particularly when the systems consist
of quantum spins or qubits. Here we introduce a photonic molecule subjected to
multiple RF/optical drives and dissipation as a promising candidate system to
observe quantized transport along Floquet synthetic dimensions. Topological
energy pumping in the incommensurately modulated photonic molecule is enhanced
by the driven-dissipative nature of our platform. Furthermore, we provide a
path to realizing Weyl points and measuring the Berry curvature emanating from
these reciprocal-space ($k$-space) magnetic monopoles, illustrating the
capabilities for higher-dimensional topological Hamiltonian simulation in this
platform. Our approach enables direct $k$-space engineering of a wide variety
of Hamiltonians using modulation bandwidths that are well below the

While on-road autonomous vehicles have been extensively studied, off-road
vehicles pose many challenging modeling problems. An off-road vehicle
encounters highly complex and difficult-to-model terrain/vehicle interactions,
as well as having complex vehicle dynamics of its own. These complexities can
create challenges for effective high-speed control and planning. In this paper,
we introduce a framework for multistep dynamics prediction that explicitly
handles the accumulation of modeling error and remains scalable for
sampling-based controllers. Our method uses a specially-initialized Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) over a limited time horizon as the learned component
in a hybrid model to predict the dynamics of a 4-person seating all-terrain
vehicle (Polaris S4 1000 RZR) in two distinct environments. By only having the
LSTM predict over a fixed time horizon, we negate the need for long term
stability that is often a challenge when training recurrent neural networks.
Our framework is flexible as it only requires odometry information for labels.
Through extensive experimentation, we show that our method is able to predict
millions of possible trajectories in real-time, with a time horizon of five
seconds in challenging off road driving scenarios.

reconstruction methods to procedurally generated context generation. This paper
aims to complement existing methods of 3D building generation. First, we
present a literature review covering different options for procedurally

over multiple contexts enables the verification and configuration of scenes,
using the combination of different scene ontologies. We describe a framework
for semantically guided data generation, based on a combination of MR-CKR and

biases on quantities measured by an analysis. In this paper, we present a
method to recover a model-independent, event-wise estimation of the detector

a re-weighting scheme for every event, which can be used to apply the effects

indistinguishable). In this model, each party's local view consists of the
adjacency list of one vertex.
  In the noninteractive model, we prove that additive $\Omega(n^2)$ error is
necessary, where $n$ is the number of nodes. This lower bound is our main
technical contribution. It uses a reconstruction attack with a new class of
linear queries and a novel mix-and-match strategy of running the local
randomizers with different completions of their adjacency lists. It matches the
additive error of the algorithm based on Randomized Response, proposed by
Imola, Murakami and Chaudhuri (USENIX2021) and analyzed by Imola, Murakami and

postprocessing of Randomized Response and provide tight bounds on the variance

plane of linearly polarized light of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by
an angle $\beta$ since its emission. This has recently been measured to be
non-zero at a statistical significance of $3.6\sigma$ in the official Planck
PR4 and 9-year WMAP data. In this work, we constrain $\beta$ using the
reprocessed BeyondPlanck LFI and Cosmoglobe DR1 WMAP polarization maps. These
novel maps have both lower systematic residuals and a more complete error
description than the corresponding official products. Foreground $EB$
correlations could bias measurements of $\beta$, and while thermal dust $EB$
emission has been argued to be statistically non-zero, no evidence for
synchrotron $EB$ power has been reported. Unlike the dust-dominated Planck HFI
maps, the majority of the LFI and WMAP polarization maps are instead dominated
by synchrotron emission. Simultaneously constraining $\beta$ and the
polarization miscalibration angle, $\alpha$, of each channel, we find a
best-fit value of $\beta=0.35^{\circ}\pm0.70^{\circ}$ with LFI and WMAP data
only. When including the Planck HFI PR4 maps, but fitting $\beta$ separately
for dust-dominated, $\beta_{>70\,\mathrm{GHz}}$, and synchrotron-dominated
channels, $\beta_{\leq 70\,\mathrm{GHz}}$, we find $\beta_{\leq
70\,\mathrm{GHz}}=0.53^{\circ}\pm0.28^\circ$. This differs from zero with a
statistical significance of $1.9\sigma$, and the main contribution to this
value comes from the LFI 70 GHz channel. While the statistical significances of
these results are low on their own, the measurement derived from the LFI and
WMAP synchrotron-dominated maps agrees with the previously reported
HFI-dominated constraints, despite the very different astrophysical and
instrumental systematics involved in all these experiments.

calculations, which require extrapolation for large Ioffe-time values. I
perform an explicit Fourier transform for both the pseudo-PDF and quasi-PDF,
and investigate their behavior within the first two leading twist
contributions.
  I show that the quark pseudo-PDF captures the BFKL resummation (resummation
of all twists) and exhibits a rising behavior for small $x_B$ values, while the
quasi-PDF presents a different behavior. I demonstrate that an appropriate
small-$x_B$ behavior cannot be achieved solely through DGLAP dynamics,
emphasizing the importance of all-twist resummation. This study provides
valuable insights into quark non-local operators' high-energy behavior and the
limitations of lattice calculations in this context.

accumulate extensive experiences and knowledge, enabling newborn descendants to

models to incorporate three key characteristics of genes. (i) Accumulating: the
knowledge is accumulated during the continuous learning of an \textbf{ancestry

a much more compact information piece, \ie \textbf{learngene}. (iii):
Inheriting: the condensed \textbf{learngene} is inherited to make it easier for
\textbf{descendant models} to adapt to new environments. Since accumulating has
been studied in some well-developed paradigms like large-scale pre-training and
lifelong learning, we focus on condensing and inheriting, which induces three
key issues and we provide the preliminary solutions to these issues in this

Condensing: we identify which layers among the ancestry model have the most

some randomly initialized layers to the \textbf{learngene} layers. Extensive

requires a precise and dependable positioning solution that is not influenced

literature to provide such a positioning solution. Yet, it is evident that 5G
alone will not be able to provide uninterrupted positioning services, as
outages are inevitable to occur. Towards that end, few works have explored the
benefits of integrating mmWave positioning with onboard motion sensors (OBMS)
like inertial measurement units (IMUs) and odometers. Inspired by INS-GNSS
integration literature, all methods defaulted to a tightly-coupled (TC)
integration scheme, which hinders the potential of such an integration.
Additionally, the proposed methods were validated using simulated 5G and INS
data with probability-based line-of-sight (LOS) assumptions. Such an
experimental setup fails to highlight the true advantages and challenges of
5G-OBMS integration. Therefore, this study first explores a loosely-coupled
(LC) 5G-OBMS integration scheme as a viable alternative to TC schemes. Next, it
examines the merits and challenges of such an integration in a deep-urban
setting using a novel quasi-real simulation setup. The setup comprises
quasi-real 5G measurements from the Siradel simulator and real commercial-grade
IMU measurements from a challenging one-hour-long trajectory in downtown
Toronto. The trajectory featured multiple natural 5G outages which helped with
assessing the integration's performance. The proposed LC method achieved a
14-cm level of accuracy for 95% of the time, while significantly limiting
positioning errors during natural 5G outages.

on a metaheuristic algorithm that is focused on tackling the unique challenges
of time-constrained observing missions, like Pandora. Our scheduling algorithm
combines a minimum transit requirement metric, which ensures we meet
observational requirements, with a `quality' metric that considers three
factors to determine the scientific quality of each observation window around
an exoplanet transit (defined as a visit). These three factors are: observing
efficiency during a visit, the amount of the transit captured by the telescope
during a visit, and how much of the transit captured is contaminated by a
coincidental passing of the observatory through the South Atlantic Anomaly. The
importance of each of these factors can be adjusted based on the needs or
preferences of the science team. Utilizing this schedule optimizer, we develop
and compare a few schedules with differing factor weights for the Pandora
SmallSat mission, illustrating trade-offs that should be considered between the
three quality factors. We also find that under all scenarios probed, Pandora
will not only be able to achieve its observational requirements using the

Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different
scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are
primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of
early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character
recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn
creating uncertainty about existing classifiers' performances. To address these
limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean

evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three
factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise
impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained
Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of
predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously
identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier's performance
can decline by around 10% to 20% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights
discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building

solutions to a variety of problems defined on networks. MP approximations are
generally accurate in locally tree-like networks but require corrections to
maintain their accuracy level in networks rich with short cycles. However, MP
may already be computationally challenging on very large networks and
additional costs incurred by correcting for cycles could be be prohibitive. We
show how the issue can be addressed. By allowing each node in the network to
have its own level of approximation, one can focus on improving the accuracy of
MP approaches in a targeted manner. We perform a systematic analysis of 109
real-world networks and show that our node-based MP approximation is able to
increase both the accuracy and speed of traditional MP approaches. We find
that, compared to conventional message passing, a heterogeneous approach based
on a simple heuristic is more accurate in 81% of tested networks, faster in 64%
of cases, and both more accurate and faster in 49% of cases.

  In this paper, we revisit these seminal results. First, we observe that all
these systems are equivalent in the sense of implementing each other. Then, we

are known to exist in large numbers at low metallicity in the Milky Way halo
and are important tracers of early Galactic chemical evolution. However, very
few such stars have been identified in the classical dwarf spheroidal (dSph)
galaxies, and detailed abundances, including neutron-capture element
abundances, have only been reported for 12 stars. Aims: We aim to derive
detailed abundances of six CEMP stars identified in the Carina dSph and compare
the abundances to CEMP stars in other dSph galaxies and the Milky Way halo.
This is the largest sample of CEMP stars in a dSph galaxy analysed to date.
Methods: 1D LTE elemental abundances are derived via equivalent width and
spectral synthesis using high-resolution spectra of the six stars obtained with
the MIKE spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory. Results: Abundances or upper
limits are derived for up to 27 elements from C to Os in the six stars. The
analysis reveals one of the stars to be a CEMP-no star with very low
neutron-capture element abundances. In contrast, the other five stars all show
enhancements in neutron-capture elements in addition to their carbon
enhancement, classifying them as CEMP-$s$ and -$r/s$ stars. The six stars have
similar $\alpha$ and iron-peak element abundances as other stars in Carina,
except for the CEMP-no star, which shows enhancement in Na, Mg, and Si. We
explore the absolute carbon abundances ($A(\rm C)$) of CEMP stars in dSph
galaxies and find similar behaviour as is seen for Milky Way halo CEMP stars,
but highlight that CEMP-$r/s$ stars primarily have very high $A(\rm C)$ values.
We also compare the neutron-capture element abundances of the CEMP-$r/s$ stars
in our sample to recent $i$-process yields, which provide a good match to the
derived abundances.

that bosonic, AFM $t$-$J$ models may contain similar physics as the collective

mass $\sim 3\times 10^6 \, \rm M_\odot$ in the dwarf galaxy Leo I, placing the
system $\sim50$ times above the standard, local $M_{BH} - M_\star$ relation.
While a few over-massive central SMBHs are reported in nearby isolated
galaxies, this is the first detected in a Milky Way satellite. We used the
ASTRID and Illustris TNG50 LCDM cosmological simulations to investigate the
assembly history of galaxies hosting over-massive SMBHs. We estimate that, at
the stellar mass of Leo I, $\sim15\%$ of galaxies above the $M_{BH} - M_\star$
relation lie $>10$ times above it. Leo I-like systems are rare but exist in
LCDM simulations: they occur in $\sim0.005\%$ of all over-massive systems.
Examining the properties of simulated galaxies harboring over-massive central
SMBHs, we find that: (i) stars assemble more slowly in galaxies above the
$M_{BH} - M_\star$ relation; (ii) the gas fraction in these galaxies
experiences a significantly steeper decline over time; and (iii) $>95\%$ of
satellite host galaxies in over-dense regions are located above the $M_{BH} -
M_\star$ relation. This suggests that massive satellite infall and consequent
tidal stripping in a group/dense environment can drive systems away from the
$M_{BH} - M_\star$ relation, causing them to become over-massive. As the
merging histories of over-massive and under-massive systems do not differ, we
conclude that additional environmental effects, such as being in overdense
regions, must play a crucial role. In the high-$z$ Universe, central
over-massive SMBHs are a signature of heavy black hole seeds; we demonstrate,
in contrast, that low-$z$ over-massive systems result from complex
environmental interactions.

the geometry of the edge-on protoplanetary disk HH 48 NE and the
characteristics of the host star. HH 48 NE is part of the JWST early release
science program Ice Age. This work serves as a stepping stone towards a better
understanding of the disk physical structure and icy chemistry in this
particular source. This kind of modeling lays the groundwork for studying other
edge-on sources to be observed with the JWST. Methods. We fit a parameterized
dust model to HH 48 NE by coupling the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D and an
MCMC framework. The dust structure was fitted independently to a compiled SED,
a scattered light image at 0.8 ${\mu}$m and an ALMA dust continuum observation

settled to the disk midplane, less than in average disks, and that the
atmospheric layers of the disk contain exclusively large grains (0.3-10
${\mu}$m). The exclusion of small grains in the upper atmosphere likely has
important consequences for the chemistry due to the deep penetration of
high-energy photons. The addition of a relatively large cavity (ca. 50 au in
radius) is necessary to explain the strong mid-infrared emission, and to fit
the scattered light and continuum observations simultaneously.

the effect of electron band geometry and/or topology on the electron-phonon

effective Euler number -- topological aspects previously unknown in MgB$_2$.
Given that MgB$_2$ is a phonon-mediated superconductor with critical
temperature about 39K, our results suggest that the nontrivial electron band
geometry/topology might favor superconductivity with relatively high critical
temperature.

frustration as a function of temperature. In doublon doped systems, we uncover
a crossover between Nagaoka-type ferromagnetic (FM) correlations at high

doublon at low temperature. For hole doped systems, kinetic
Haerter-Shastry-type AFM at high temperature as well as exchange interactions
at low temperature favor $120^{\circ}$ order, strengthening magnetic
correlations compared to the undoped system. In the ground state, the presence
of AFM correlations throughout a wide range of interactions indicates
confinement of both types of dopants. In this regime we firmly establish the
presence of linear confining potentials via energy scaling arguments,
supporting the picture of geometric strings in the frustrated triangular $t-J$

due to crosstalk into a depolarising noise channel that can then be treated
using established error mitigation schemes such as noise estimation circuits.
We apply our approach to the quantum simulation of the non-equilibrium dynamics
of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) Hamiltonian for superconductivity, a
model that is particularly challenging because of the long-range interaction of
Cooper pairs. With 135 CNOT gates, we work in a regime where crosstalk, as
opposed to either trotterization or qubit decoherence, dominates the error. Our
twirling of neighbouring qubits is shown to dramatically improve the noise

of carbon over iron ([C/Fe]>+0.7): the so-called carbon-enhanced metal-poor
stars. Conversely, a similar carbon excess caused by first-star pollution was
not found in dense neutral gas traced by absorption systems at different cosmic

absorbers at redshift z~3-4. Among these, 3 are carbon-enhanced and reveal an
overabundance with respect to Fe of all the analyzed chemical elements (O, Mg,

i.e. z>6) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBH) with masses
$\gtrsim10^9~M_\odot$ challenges models of early SMBH formation. To shed light
on the nature of these sources we started a multiwavelength programme based on
a sample of 18 HYPerluminous quasars at the Epoch of ReionizatION (HYPERION).
These are the luminous QSOs whose SMBH must have had the most rapid mass growth
during the Universe first Gyr. In this paper we present the HYPERION sample and
report on the first of the 3 years planned observations of the 2.4 Ms
XMM-Newton Multi-Year Heritage programme on which HYPERION is based. The goal
of this programme is to accurately characterise the X-ray nuclear properties of
QSOs at the EoR. Through a joint X-ray spectral analysis of 10 sources,
covering the rest-frame $\sim2-50$ keV range, we report a steep average photon
index ($\Gamma\sim2.4\pm0.1$) which is inconsistent at $\geq4\sigma$ level with
the value measured in QSO at z<6. This spectral slope is also significantly
steeper than that reported in lower-z QSOs with similar luminosity or accretion
rate, thus suggesting a genuine redshift evolution. Alternatively, we can
interpret this result as the presence of an unusually low-energy cutoff
$E_{cut}\sim20$ keV on a standard $\Gamma=1.9$ power-law. We also report on
mild indications that HYPERION QSOs show higher soft X-ray emission at 2 keV
compared to the UV one at 2500A than expected by lower-z luminous AGN. We
speculate that a redshift-dependent coupling between the X-ray corona and
accretion disc or intrinsically different coronal properties may account for
the steep spectral slopes, especially in the presence of powerful winds. The
reported slopes, if confirmed at lower luminosities, may have an important
impact on the design of future X-ray facilities and surveys aimed at the early
Universe.

relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasma with strong synchrotron
cooling and a small mass fraction of non-radiating ions. Our results
demonstrate that the structure of the current sheet is highly sensitive to the
dynamic efficiency of radiative cooling. Specifically, stronger cooling leads
to more significant compression of the plasma and magnetic field within the
plasmoids. We demonstrate that ions can be efficiently accelerated to energies
exceeding the plasma magnetization parameter, $\gg\sigma$, and form a hard
power-law energy distribution, $f_i\propto \gamma^{-1}$. This conclusion
implies a highly efficient proton acceleration in the magnetospheres of young
pulsars. Conversely, the energies of pairs are limited to either $\sigma$ in
the strong cooling regime or the radiation burnoff limit, $\gamma_{\rm syn}$,
when cooling is weak. We find that the high-energy radiation from pairs above
the synchrotron burnoff limit, $\varepsilon_c \approx 16$ MeV, is only
efficiently produced in the strong cooling regime, $\gamma_{\rm syn} < \sigma$.
In this regime, we find that the spectral cutoff scales as $\varepsilon_{\rm
cut}\approx \varepsilon_c (\sigma/\gamma_{\rm syn})$, and the highest energy
photons are beamed along the direction of the upstream magnetic field,
consistent with the phenomenological models of gamma-ray emission from young
pulsars. Furthermore, our results place constraints on the reconnection-driven

variations of UFO BAL quasars are slightly smaller compared to that of non-BAL

($\sim$95%), the fractional variability amplitude ($\frac{\Delta W}{W}$) and
the fraction of ``highly variable"" BAL (i.e., |$\frac{\Delta W}{W}$| $>$0.67)

population. The scatter in $\frac{\Delta W}{W}$ and the fraction of ``highly

distribution is asymmetric at large time scales. We attribute this to the BAL
strengthening time scales being shorter than the weakening time scales. The BAL
variability amplitude correlates strongly with the BAL properties compared to
the quasar properties. BALs with low W, high-velocity, shallow profiles, and
low-velocity width tend to show more variability. When multiple BAL components
are present a correlated variability is seen between low- and high-velocity

absorption features in PPDs and determine how well the abundance of the main

local saturation. Spatially observed ice optical depths cannot be directly

Population III (Pop III) stars were likely very massive and, therefore,

generations of normal (Pop II) stars. For this purpose, we compare the measured
carbon and iron abundances of the metal-poor halo stars with the ones predicted

Streaming Instability (SI), and Dust Settling Instability (DSI), to name a few.
Notably, the VSI and COS have mostly been studied in purely gaseous discs,
while the SI and DSI have only been analyzed in isothermal discs. How these
instabilities operate under more general conditions is therefore unclear. To
this end, we devise a local model of a PPD describing a non-isothermal gas
interacting with a single species of dust via drag forces. Using this, we find
that dust drag sets minimum length scales below which the VSI and COS are
suppressed. Similarly, we find that the SI can be suppressed on sufficiently
small scales by the gas' radial buoyancy if it cools on roughly a dynamical
timescale. We show that the DSI can be effectively stabilized by vertical
buoyancy, except at special radial and vertical length scales. We also find
novel instabilities unique to a dusty, non-isothermal gas. These result in a
dusty analog of the COS that operates in slowly cooled discs, and a dusty
version of the VSI that is strongly enhanced by dust settling. We briefly
discuss the possible implications of our results on planetesimal formation.

by these facts, we investigate the classical dynamics of a closed Universe with
a plateau-type potential. Depending on the initial inflaton field value, the
Universe can undergo a variety of events: an immediate Big Crunch, a bounce or

irrelevant to our Universe, they can be turned into a single or multiple
bounces followed by inflation, taking into account the interactions necessary

functional connectivity (FC) had great relevance in the field. FC can be
investigated on different levels, going from global features to single edges
between regions, revealing diffuse and localized dysconnection patterns. In
this context, SZ is characterized by a diverse global integration with reduced
connectivity in specific areas of the Default Mode Network (DMN). However, the
assessment of FC presents various sources of uncertainty. This study proposes a
multi-level approach for more robust group-comparison. FC between 74 AAL brain
areas of 15 healthy controls (HC) and 12 SZ subjects were used. Multi-level
analyses and graph topological indexes evaluation were carried out by the
previously published SPIDER-NET tool. Robustness was augmented by bootstrapped
(BOOT) data and the stability was evaluated by removing one (RST1) or two
subjects (RST2). The DMN subgraph was evaluated, toegether with overall local
indexes and connection weights to enhance common activations/deactivations. At
a global level, expected trends were found. The robustness assessment tests
highlighted more stable results for BOOT compared to the direct data testing.
Conversely, significant results were found in the analysis at lower levels. The
DMN highlighted reduced connectivity and strength as well as increased
deactivation in the SZ group. At local level, 13 areas were found to be
significantly different ($p<0.05$), highlighting a greater divergence in the
frontal lobe. These results were confirmed analyzing the negative edges,
suggesting inverted connectivity between prefronto-temporal areas. In
conclusion, multi-level analysis supported by BOOT is highly recommended,

limited samples.

been proposed to address the challenge of poor overlap, and methods enabling
flexible machine learning for nuisance models address model misspecification.
However, the approaches that allow machine learning for nuisance models have
not been extended to the setting of weighted average treatment effects for
time-to-event outcomes when there is poor overlap. In this work, we propose a
class of one-step cross-fitted double/debiased machine learning estimators for

prove that the proposed estimators are consistent, asymptotically linear, and
reach semiparametric efficiency bounds under regularity conditions. Our

important to identify and address the security and privacy vulnerabilities
before they can be widely exploited. One major concern is the involvement of
third party tools and hardware. Usage of untrusted hardware could present the
risk of intellectual property (IP) theft. For example the hybrid quantum
classical algorithms like QAOA encodes the graph properties e.g. number of
nodes edges and connectivity in the parameterized quantum circuit to solve a
graph maxcut problem. QAOA employs a classical computer which optimizes the
parameters of a parametric quantum circuit (which encodes graph structure)
iteratively by executing the circuit on a quantum hardware and measuring the
output. The graph properties can be readily retrieved by analyzing the QAOA
circuit by the untrusted quantum hardware provider. To mitigate this risk, we
propose an edge pruning obfuscation method for QAOA along with a split
iteration methodology. The basic idea is to (i) create two flavors of QAOA
circuit each with few distinct edges eliminated from the problem graph for
obfuscation (ii) iterate the circuits alternately during optimization process
to uphold the optimization quality and (iii) send the circuits to two different
untrusted hardware provider so that the adversary has access to partial graph
protecting the IP. We demonstrate that combining edge pruning obfuscation with
split iteration on two different hardware secures the IP and increases the
difficulty of reconstruction while limiting performance degradation to a
maximum of 10 percent (approximately 5 percent on average) and maintaining low
overhead costs (less than 0.5X for QAOA with single layer implementation).

becoming neutrino-dominated, which results in interior structures that are
difficult to explode and likely lead to black hole formation. The
characteristic black-hole masses from binary-stripped stars have corresponding

theoretical methods capable of treating light and matter from first principles.
A popular such method is quantum electrodynamical density functional theory
(QEDFT) which is a generalization of density functional theory to situations
where the electronic system is coupled to quantized light modes. While this
method provides a powerful description of the electronic system and the
quantized modes of light, it has so far been unable to deal correctly with
absorbing and dispersing electromagnetic media in practice. In addition, the
cavity field strength parameters have not been linked to the real
electromagnetic environment in which the matter is embedded meaning that these
are effectively free parameters. In this paper, we discuss how macroscopic QED
(MQED) can be invoked to correctly parameterize QEDFT for realistic optical
cavity setups. To exemplify this approach, we consider the example of a
absorbing spherical cavity and study the impact of different parameters of both
the environment and the electronic system on the transition from weak-to-strong
coupling. As a result of our work, the coupling parameters in general, lossy
environments can be now expressed in terms of the classical Dyadic Green's
Function. Because the Dyadic Green's Function is completely determined by the
electromagnetic environment and the boundary conditions, it thus removes the
light-matter coupling strengths as free parameters. As part of this work, we
also provide an easy to use tool that can calculate the cavity coupling

S-DOTA may help address generalization due to domain shift in real world

and deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are an important diagnostic in High
Energy Density Physics experiments as the spectra are sensitive to the
velocities of reacting ions. Methods exist for calculating these spectra in
radiation-hydrodynamic (""hydro"") and Particle-in-Cell (""PiC"") simulations. The
spectra are particularly sensitive to the high energy tail of ion velocity
distribution functions since reaction cross sections increase rapidly with the
kinetic energy of a reacting ion pair at the energies achieved in laboratory
experiments. This means both the hydro and PiC method may not be suitable in
certain plasma regimes. The hydro method assumes that the ion velocity
distribution is locally Maxwellian, while the PiC method is subject to
statistical noise that makes it challenging to accurately simulate finer
details of the spectra. In this work, we present a complementary approach: a
method for calculating the neutron spectra in ion Vlasov-Fokker-Planck
simulations in which the velocity distribution function is fully-resolved. The
method is implemented in the spherically-symmetric code iFP which is used to
simulate laser-driven Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments. The method is
computationally intensive as it requires a five-dimensional numerical integral,
but no approximations of the distribution functions or differential cross
sections are required. Results show that deviations of the ion distribution
functions from Maxwellian can have a noticeable effect on neutron spectra in
shock-driven ICF implosions. The method should facilitate more accurate
benchmarking of simulations and experiments.

regression analysis. Therefore, we focused on building a robust supervised
machine learning model to predict surface stellar rotation periods from
structured data sets built from the Kepler catalogue of K and M stars. We
analysed the set of independent variables extracted from Kepler light curves
and investigated the relationships between them and the ground truth. Using the
extreme gradient boosting method, we obtained a minimal set of variables that
can be used to build machine learning models for predicting stellar rotation
periods. Our models are validated by predicting the rotation periods of about
2900 stars. The results are compatible with those obtained by classical
techniques and comparable to those obtained by other recent machine learning
approaches, with the advantage of using much fewer predictors. Restricting the
analysis to stars with rotation periods of less than 45 days, our models are on
average 95 to 98 % correct. We have developed an innovative approach, based on
a machine learning method, to accurately fit the rotation periods of stars.
Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the best models generated
by the proposed methodology are competitive with the state-of-the-art
approaches, with the advantage of being computationally cheaper, easy to train,
and relying on small sets of predictors.

surrounded by stable and massive circumbinary disks similar to protoplanetary
disks found around young stars. Around 10% of these disks are transition disks:
they have a large inner cavity in the dust. Previous interferometric
measurements and modeling have ruled out the cavity being formed by dust
sublimation and suggested that the cavity is due to a massive circumbinary
planet that traps the dust in the disk and produces the observed depletion of
refractory elements on the surface of the post-AGB star. In this study, we test
alternative scenario in which the large cavity could be due to dynamical
truncation from the inner binary. We performed near-infrared interferometric
observations with the CHARA Array on the archetype of such a transition disk
around a post-AGB binary: AC Her. We detect the companion at ten epochs over 4
years and determine the 3-dimensional orbit using these astrometric
measurements in combination with the radial velocity time series. This is the
first astrometric orbit constructed for a post-AGB binary system. We derive the
best-fit orbit with a semi-major axis $2.01 \pm 0.01$ mas ($2.83\pm0.08$ au),
inclination $(142.9 \pm 1.1)^\circ$ and longitude of the ascending node $(155.1

sublimation radius are at least $\sim3\times$ smaller than the observed inner
disk radius ($\sim21.5$ mas or 30 au). This strengthens the hypothesis that the
origin of such a cavity is due to the presence of a circumbinary planet.

ride-sharing enterprises utilize a 100%-electrified fleet of vehicles, and
seeks responses to the following key question: How can renewable-based EV
charging be maximized without disrupting the quality of the ride-sharing
services? We propose a new mechanism to promote EV charging during hours of
high renewable generation, and we introduce the concept of charge request,
which is issued by a power utility company. Our mechanism is inspired by a
game-theoretic approach where the power utility company proposes incentives and
the ride-sharing platform assigns vehicles to both ride and charge requests;
the bargaining mechanism leads to prices and EV assignments that are aligned
with the notion of Nash equilibria. Numerical results show that it is possible
to shift the EV charging during periods of high renewable generation and adapt
to intermittent generation while minimizing the impact on the quality of
service. The paper also investigates how the users' willingness to ride-share
affects the charging strategy and the quality of service.

instruction in the wake of growing critique of algorithms and systems showing
that they reinforce structural oppression. There has been increasing desire on
the part of data science educators to craft curricula that speak to these
critiques, yet much ethics education remains individualized, focused on
specific cases, or too abstract and unapplicable. We synthesized some of the
most popular critical data science works and designed a data science ethics
course that spoke to the social phenomena at the root of critical data studies
-- theories of oppression, social systems, power, history, and change --
through analysis of a pressing sociotechnical system: surveillance systems.
Through analysis of student reflections and final projects, we determined that
at the conclusion of the semester, all students had developed critical analysis
skills that allowed them to investigate surveillance systems of their own and
identify their benefits, harms, main proponents, those who resist them, and
their interplay with social systems, all while considering dimensions of race,
class, gender, and more. We argue that this type of instruction -- directly
teaching data science ethics alongside social theory -- is a crucial next step
for the field.

language models than fine-tuning on downstream natural language understanding
tasks. However, the existing prompt tuning methods have training instability
issues, as the variance of scores under different random seeds is quite large.
To address this critical problem, we first investigate and find that the loss
landscape of vanilla prompt tuning is precipitous when it is visualized, where
a slight change of input data can cause a big fluctuation in the loss
landscape. This is an essential factor that leads to the instability of prompt
tuning. Based on this observation, we introduce perturbation-based
regularizers, which can smooth the loss landscape, into prompt tuning. We
propose a new algorithm, called Prompt Tuning with Perturbation-based
regularizer~(PTP), which can not only alleviate training instability
dramatically but also boost the performance of prompt tuning. We design two
kinds of perturbation-based regularizers, including random-noise-based and
adversarial-based. In particular, our proposed perturbations are flexible on
both text space and embedding space. Extensive experiments show the
effectiveness of our proposed methods in stabilizing the training. Our new
algorithms improve the state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods by 1.94\% and

can occur before star formation, leading to heavier BH seeds than standard
baryonic channels. The SMBH seeds subsequently grow by accretion. We compute
the evolution of the mass and angular momentum of the BH using a geodesic

exhibit rich structures and are generically challenging to study in microscopic

Concretely, we consider a decorated two-dimensional toric code model for which
the ground state can be expressed as a two-dimensional tensor-network state
with bond dimension $D=3$ and two tunable parameters. We find that the
time-reversal (TR) symmetric system exhibits three distinct phases (i) an SET
toric code phase in which anyons transform non-trivially under TR, (ii) a toric
code phase in which TR does not fractionalize, and (iii) a topologically
trivial phase that is adiabatically connected to a product state. We
characterize the different phases using the topological entanglement entropy
and a membrane order parameter that distinguishes the two SET phases. Along the
phase boundary between the SET toric code phase and the toric code phase, the
model has an enhanced $U(1)$ symmetry and the ground state is a quantum
critical loop gas wavefunction whose squared norm is equivalent to the
partition function of the classical $O(2)$ model. By duality transformations,
this tensor-network solvable model can also be used to describe transitions
between SET double-semion phases and between $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$

Since better memory would typically prompt better generation~(we define this as

selecting memory that exhibits the highest similarity to the input. However,
this method is constrained by the quality of the fixed corpus from which memory
is retrieved. In this paper, by exploring the duality of the primal problem:
better generation also prompts better memory, we propose a novel framework,
selfmem, which addresses this limitation by iteratively employing a
retrieval-augmented generator to create an unbounded memory pool and using a
memory selector to choose one output as memory for the subsequent generation
round. This enables the model to leverage its own output, referred to as
self-memory, for improved generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of selfmem

  Transformer APIs",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large language models (LLMs) power many state-of-the-art systems in natural
language processing. However, these models are extremely computationally
expensive, even at inference time, raising the natural question: when is the
extra cost of deploying a larger model worth the anticipated boost in
capabilities? Better understanding this tradeoff fundamentally could benefit
from an inference efficiency metric that is both (i) easily comparable across
models from different providers, and (ii) representative of the true cost of
running queries in an isolated performance environment. Unfortunately, access
to LLMs today is largely restricted to black-box text generation APIs and raw
runtimes measured through this interface do not satisfy these desiderata: model
providers can apply various software and hardware optimizations orthogonal to
the model, and models served on shared infrastructure are susceptible to
performance contention. To circumvent these problems, we propose a new metric
for comparing inference efficiency across models. This metric puts models on
equal footing as though they were served (i) on uniform hardware and software,
and (ii) without performance contention. We call this metric the
\emph{idealized runtime}, and we propose a methodology to efficiently estimate
this metric for autoregressive Transformer models. We also propose cost-aware
variants that incorporate the number of accelerators needed to serve the model.
Using these metrics, we compare ten state-of-the-art LLMs to provide the first
analysis of inference efficiency-capability tradeoffs; we make several
observations from this analysis, including the fact that the superior inference
runtime performance of certain APIs is often a byproduct of optimizations
within the API rather than the underlying model. Our methodology also
facilitates the efficient comparison of different software and hardware stacks.

on the presumption that clients will implement the specified design to
collaborate with the server. In reality, however, it may not be possible to
modify the client's existing protocols. To address this challenge, this work
focuses on clients who always maximize their individual cumulative rewards, and
introduces a novel idea of ""reward teaching"", where the server guides the
clients towards global optimality through implicit local reward adjustments.
Under this framework, the server faces two tightly coupled tasks of bandit
learning and target teaching, whose combination is non-trivial and challenging.
A phased approach, called Teaching-After-Learning (TAL), is first designed to
encourage and discourage clients' explorations separately. General performance
analyses of TAL are established when the clients' strategies satisfy certain
mild requirements. With novel technical approaches developed to analyze the
warm-start behaviors of bandit algorithms, particularized guarantees of TAL
with clients running UCB or epsilon-greedy strategies are then obtained. These
results demonstrate that TAL achieves logarithmic regrets while only incurring
logarithmic adjustment costs, which is order-optimal w.r.t. a natural lower
bound. As a further extension, the Teaching-While-Learning (TWL) algorithm is
developed with the idea of successive arm elimination to break the non-adaptive
phase separation in TAL. Rigorous analyses demonstrate that when facing clients
with UCB1, TWL outperforms TAL in terms of the dependencies on sub-optimality
gaps thanks to its adaptive design. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of the proposed algorithms.

high-quality and robust FUV-radio data are available to provide an ideal sample

extension links the radio continuum to the FIR emission, we explore the benefit
of using radio continuum measurements as a constraint on the energy balance
between dust attenuation and emission. We find that for situations where
MIR-FIR photometry is unavailable, including a 1.4 GHz continuum measurement
allows for improved accuracy in recovered star formation rates and dust
luminosities of galaxies reducing the median uncertainty by 0.1 and 0.2 dex

extending FUV-FIR SED fitting techniques to radio frequencies, especially as we

validation, that iteratively fits a probabilistic surrogate model to
efficiently predict failures. The algorithm is designed to search for failures,
compute the most-likely failure, and estimate the failure probability over an
operating domain using importance sampling. We introduce a set of three
acquisition functions that focus on reducing uncertainty by covering the design

capacity for the G2U uplink channel in the presence of interference, noise, and
potential jamming. Subsequently, given the reliability constraint, the error
exponent is obtained for the given channel. Furthermore, a relay UAV in the
dual-hop relay mode, with amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol, is considered, for
which we jointly obtain the optimal positions of the relay and the receiver
UAVs in the presence of interference. Interestingly, in our study, we find that
for both the point-to-point and relayed links, increasing the transmit power
may not always be an optimal solution for delay minimization problems.
Moreover, we prove that there exists an optimal height that minimizes the

framework can be used in practice by a network controller as a system

leading to the lowest transmission latency can be incorporated into the

luminosity function change throughout diverse stellar environments in M31's NE
disk from 13<d<18 kpc using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
Treasury (PHAT). As expected, the mode is found to be fainter in
higher-reddening regions. To cross-check this result, we also measure a
fiducial J-band ground-based JAGB distance using data from the UKIRT/WFCam in
M31's outermost disk (18<d<40 kpc) where internal reddening is minimal. We find
that this J-band distance modulus agrees well with the F110W distance moduli
measured in the lowest reddening regions of the PHAT data, demonstrating the
JAGB method is most accurate if measured in the low-reddening outer disks of
galaxies. On the other hand, the mode of the JAGB star luminosity function
appears empirically to show no dependence on metallicity and age, disputing
theoretical predictions that the average luminosity of metal-rich carbon stars
is brighter than for metal-poor carbon stars. In conclusion, the JAGB method
proves to be a robust standard candle capable of calibrating the luminosities

training examples, data acquisition obstacles still persist for rare-class
tasks -- when the class label is very infrequent (e.g. < 5% of samples). Active
learning has in general been proposed to alleviate such challenges, but choice
of selection strategy, the criteria by which rare-class examples are chosen,
has not been systematically evaluated. Further, transformers enable iterative
transfer-learning approaches. We propose and investigate transfer- and active
learning solutions to the rare class problem of dissonance detection through
utilizing models trained on closely related tasks and the evaluation of
acquisition strategies, including a proposed probability-of-rare-class (PRC)
approach. We perform these experiments for a specific rare class problem:
collecting language samples of cognitive dissonance from social media. We find
that PRC is a simple and effective strategy to guide annotations and ultimately
improve model accuracy while transfer-learning in a specific order can improve
the cold-start performance of the learner but does not benefit iterations of
active learning.

have achieved spectacular success in generative modeling, or learning to draw
new samples from a distribution given a finite dataset of training samples.
Normalizing flows have also been applied successfully to variational inference,
wherein one attempts to learn a sampler based on an expression for the
log-likelihood or energy function of the distribution, rather than on data. In
variational inference, the unimodality of the reference Gaussian distribution
used within the normalizing flow can cause difficulties in learning multimodal
distributions. We introduce an extension of normalizing flows in which the
Gaussian reference is replaced with a reference distribution that is
constructed via a tensor network, specifically a matrix product state or tensor
train. We show that by combining flows with tensor networks on difficult
variational inference tasks, we can improve on the results obtained by using
either tool without the other.

that the Wilcoxon and Sign tests show significantly higher Type-1 error rates

were more consistent with the expected error rate. While the statistical tests
displayed differences in their power for smaller sample sizes, they showed no

multi-timescale channel customization for RIS-assisted multiple-input

customize a high-rank channel for spatial multiplexing (SM) transmission and a
highly correlated rank-1 channel for beamforming (BF) transmission by designing
the phase shifters of the RIS with statistical channel state information in the
angle-coherent time to improve spectral efficiency (SE). We derive closed-form
expressions for the approximation and upper bound of the ergodic SE and compare
them to investigate the relative SE performance of SM and BF transmissions. In
terms of reliability enhancement, we customize a fast-changing channel in the

Extensive numerical results demonstrate that flexible customization of channel
characteristics for a specific transmission scheme can achieve a tradeoff
between SE and bit error ratio performance.

transmission spectroscopy to search for excess helium absorption in the

Planet Finder spectrograph on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope. Observations were
taken over the course of seven nights, from which we obtain three transits. No
detectable helium absorption is seen, as absorption depth is measured to
$-0.0025\pm0.0021$, or $1.2 \sigma$ from a null detection. This non-detection
follows our current understanding of decreasing stellar activity (and thus
high-energy radiation) with age. We use a 1D isothermal Parker wind model to
compare with our observations and find our non-detection can best be explained
with a low planetary mass-loss rate and high thermosphere temperature. We
explore our results within the context of the full sample of helium detections

to predict CRT response. Methods. 218 patients who underwent rest gated SPECT
MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as an increase in
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 5% at a 6-month follow up. A DL
model was constructed by combining a pre-trained VGG16 module and a multilayer
perceptron. Two modalities of data were input to the model: polarmap images
from SPECT MPI and tabular data from clinical features and ECG parameters.
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the VGG16
module to provide explainability for the polarmaps. For comparison, four
machine learning (ML) models were trained using only the tabular features.
Results. Modeling was performed on 218 patients who underwent CRT implantation
with a response rate of 55.5% (n = 121). The DL model demonstrated average AUC

previous HST-based results and release the first JWST-based morphological
catalog of $\sim20,000$ galaxies in the CEERS survey. Galaxies are classified
into four main broad classes -- spheroid, disk+spheroid, disk, and disturbed --
based on imaging with four filters -- $F150W$, $F200W$, $F356W$, and $F444W$ --
using Convolutional Neural Networks trained on HST/WFC3 labeled images and
domain-adapted to JWST/NIRCam. We find that $\sim90\%$ and $\sim75\%$ of
galaxies at $z<3$ have the same early/late and regular/irregular
classification, respectively, in JWST and HST imaging when considering similar
wavelengths. For small (large) and faint objects, JWST-based classifications
tend to systematically present less bulge-dominated systems (peculiar galaxies)
than HST-based ones, but the impact on the reported evolution of morphological
fractions is less than $\sim10\%$. Using JWST-based morphologies at the same
rest-frame wavelength ($\sim0.8-1\mu$m), we confirm an increase in peculiar
galaxies and a decrease in bulge-dominated galaxies with redshift, as reported
in previous HST-based works, suggesting that the stellar mass distribution, in
addition to light distribution, is more disturbed in the early universe.
However, we find that undisturbed disk-like systems already dominate the
high-mass end of the late-type galaxy population ($\log M_*/M_\odot>10.5$) at
$z\sim5$, and bulge-dominated galaxies also exist at these early epochs,
confirming a rich and evolved morphological diversity of galaxies $\sim1$ Gyr
after the Big Bang. Finally, we find that the morphology-quenching relation is
already in place for massive galaxies at $z>3$, with massive quiescent galaxies
($\log M_*/M_\odot>10.5$) being predominantly bulge-dominated.

time an agent disconnects from a neighbor, they connect to a new neighbor. We
have observed the emergence of network homophily and, in certain cases, the
complete fragmentation of the network. Our Monte Carlo simulations also show
first-order phase transitions with metastable states. An increase in the

polarization maps will be necessary to improve the constraint of PGWs and
obtain a primordial E-mode signal. Here, we introduce a deep convolutional
neural network model named multi-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet) to
perform CMB delensing. The networks are trained on simulated CMB maps with size
$20^{\circ} \times 20^{\circ}$. We first use MIMO-UNet to reconstruct the
unlensing CMB polarization ($Q$ and $U$) maps from observed CMB maps. The
recovered E-mode power spectrum exhibits excellent agreement with the
primordial EE power spectrum. The recovery of the primordial B-mode power
spectrum for noise levels of 0, 1, and 2 $\mu$K-arcmin is greater than 98\% at

distributed systems. However, it is particularly difficult, mainly due to the
presence of Byzantine processes that act arbitrarily and the unknown message
delays in general networks.
  Although it is well known that both safety and liveness are at risk as soon
as n/3 Byzantine processes fail, very few works attempted to characterize
precisely the faults that produce safety violations from the faults that
produce termination violations.
  In this paper, we present a new lower bound on the solvability of the
consensus problem by distinguishing deceitful faults violating safety and
benign faults violating termination from the more general Byzantine faults, in
what we call the Byzantine-deceitful-benign fault model. We show that one
cannot solve consensus if $n \leq 3t + d + 2q$ with t, d, and q are Byzantine,
deceitful, and benign processes. We show that this bound is tight by presenting
the Basilic class of consensus protocols that solve consensus when $n > 3t + d
+ 2q$. These protocols differ in the number of processes from which they wait
to receive messages before progressing.
  Then, we build upon the Basilic class in order to present Zero-Loss
Blockchain (ZLB), the first blockchain that tolerates an adversary controlling
more than half of the system, with up to less than a third of them Byzantine.
ZLB is an open blockchain that combines recent theoretical advances in
accountable Byzantine agreement to exclude undeniably faulty processes.
Interestingly, ZLB does not need a known bound on the delay of messages but
progressively reduces the portion of faulty processes below 13 , and reaches
consensus. Geo-distributed experiments show that ZLB outperforms HotStuff and

  impairment among elderly Chinese","3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Introduction. The societal burden of cognitive impairments in China has
prompted researchers to develop clinical prediction models aimed at making risk
assessments that enable preventative interventions. However, it is unclear
which risk factors best predict future cognitive impairment and if predictive
ability is consistent across different socioeconomic groups. Methods. We
quantified the ability of demographics, instrumental activities of daily
living, activities of daily living, cognitive tests, social factors,
psychological factors, diet, exercise and sleep, chronic diseases, and three
recently published prediction models predict future cognitive impairments in
the general Chinese population and among male, female, rural, urban, educated,
and uneducated elderly. Data were taken from the 2011 and 2014 waves of the
Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Results. The risk factor
groups with the most predictive ability in the general population were
demographics (AUC, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.77-0.78), cognitive tests (AUC, 0.72, 95%
CI, 0.72-0.73), and instrumental activities of daily living (AUC, 0.71, 95% CI,
0.70-0.71). Demographics, cognitive tests, instrumental activities of daily
living, and all three re-created prediction models had significantly higher
AUCs when making predictions among women compared to men and among the
uneducated compared to the educated. Discussion. This study suggests that
demographics, cognitive tests, and instrumental activities of daily living are
the most useful risk factors for predicting future cognitive impairment among
elderly Chinese. However, the most useful risk factors and existing models have
lower predictive power among male, urban, and educated elderly. More efforts
are needed to ensure that equally accurate risk assessments can be conducted
across different socioeconomic groups in China.

deep neural network models. In this work, we aim to re-investigate the training
process of residual networks from a novel social psychology perspective of
loafing, and further propose a new training scheme as well as three improved
strategies for boosting residual networks beyond their performance limits.
Previous research has suggested that residual networks can be considered as
ensembles of shallow networks, which implies that the final performance of a
residual network is influenced by a group of subnetworks. We identify a
previously overlooked problem that is analogous to social loafing, where
subnetworks within a residual network are prone to exert less effort when
working as part of a group compared to working alone. We define this problem as
\textit{network loafing}. Similar to the decreased individual productivity and
overall performance as demonstrated in society, network loafing inevitably
causes sub-par performance. Inspired by solutions from social psychology, we
first propose a novel training scheme called stimulative training, which
randomly samples a residual subnetwork and calculates the KL divergence loss
between the sampled subnetwork and the given residual network for extra
supervision. In order to unleash the potential of stimulative training, we
further propose three simple-yet-effective strategies, including a novel KL-
loss that only aligns the network logits direction, random smaller inputs for
subnetworks, and inter-stage sampling rules. Comprehensive experiments and
analysis verify the effectiveness of stimulative training as well as its three
improved strategies.

uncovered that the combination of these challenges renders conventional deep
learning methods that directly learn the mapping from a low-field MR image to a
high-field MR image unsuitable. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a
novel meta-learning approach that employs a teacher-student mechanism. Firstly,
an optimal-transport-driven teacher learns the degradation process from
high-field to low-field MR images and generates pseudo-paired high-field and
low-field MRI images. Then, a score-based student solves the inverse problem of
reconstructing a high-field-like MR image from a low-field MRI within the
framework of iterative regularization, by learning the joint distribution of
pseudo-paired images to act as a regularizer. Experimental results on real
low-field MRI data demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms

single unit of the whole system, such as poses between hand and eye, or between
two hands. These methods can be used to determine the relative pose between
each unit, but the serialized incremental calibration strategy cannot avoid the
problem of error accumulation in a large-scale system. Instead of focusing on a
single unit, this paper models the multi-eye and multi-hand system calibration
problem as a graph and proposes a method based on the minimum spanning tree and
graph optimization. This method can automatically plan the serialized optimal

  https://milvlg.github.io/anetqa/",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Building benchmarks to systemically analyze different capabilities of video
question answering (VideoQA) models is challenging yet crucial. Existing
benchmarks often use non-compositional simple questions and suffer from
language biases, making it difficult to diagnose model weaknesses incisively. A
recent benchmark AGQA poses a promising paradigm to generate QA pairs
automatically from pre-annotated scene graphs, enabling it to measure diverse
reasoning abilities with granular control. However, its questions have
limitations in reasoning about the fine-grained semantics in videos as such
information is absent in its scene graphs. To this end, we present ANetQA, a
large-scale benchmark that supports fine-grained compositional reasoning over
the challenging untrimmed videos from ActivityNet. Similar to AGQA, the QA
pairs in ANetQA are automatically generated from annotated video scene graphs.
The fine-grained properties of ANetQA are reflected in the following: (i)
untrimmed videos with fine-grained semantics; (ii) spatio-temporal scene graphs
with fine-grained taxonomies; and (iii) diverse questions generated from
fine-grained templates. ANetQA attains 1.4 billion unbalanced and 13.4 million
balanced QA pairs, which is an order of magnitude larger than AGQA with a
similar number of videos. Comprehensive experiments are performed for
state-of-the-art methods. The best model achieves 44.5% accuracy while human
performance tops out at 84.5%, leaving sufficient room for improvement.

from road travel times, serving as an underlying asset that cannot be directly
traded. Within the transportation domain, these derivatives are proposed as a
more comprehensive approach to value pricing. They enable road pricing based
not only on the level of travel time but also its volatility. In the financial
market, travel time derivatives are introduced as innovative hedging
instruments to mitigate market risk, particularly in light of recent stress
experienced by the crypto market and traditional banking sector.
  The paper focuses on three main aspects: (1) the motivation behind the
introduction of these derivatives, driven by the demand for hedging; (2)
exploring the potential market for these instruments; and (3) delving into the
product design and pricing schemes associated with them. The pricing schemes
are devised by utilizing real-time travel time data captured by sensors. These
data are modeled using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes and, more broadly,
continuous time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) models. The calibration
of these models is achieved through a hidden factor model, which describes the
dynamics of travel time processes. The risk-neutral pricing principle is then
employed to determine the prices of the derivatives, employing well-designed
procedures to identify the market value of risk.

not obey Debye law, and a heat capacity which decreases monotonically with
temperature, rather than growing as in solids. Despite several attempts, a
complete and widely accepted theoretical framework able to formally derive the
aforementioned properties has not been found yet. Here, we revisit one of the
theoretical proposals, and in particular we re-analyze the properties of
liquids within the soft-potential model, originally formulated for glasses. We
confirm that, at least at a qualitative level, many characteristic properties
of liquids can be rationalized within this model. We discuss the validity of
several phenomenological expressions proposed in the literature for the density
of unstable modes, and in particular for its temperature and frequency
dependence. We discuss the role of negative curvature regions and unstable
modes as fundamental ingredients to have a linear in frequency VDOS. Finally,
we compute the heat capacity within the soft potential model for liquids and we
show that it decreases with temperature, in agreement with experimental and

consecutive frames of point clouds. Superpoints, i.e., points with similar

superpoints are generated with the offline clustering methods, which cannot
characterize local regions with similar motions for complex 3D scenes well,
leading to inaccurate scene flow estimation. To this end, we propose an
iterative end-to-end superpoint based scene flow estimation framework, where
the superpoints can be dynamically updated to guide the point-level flow
prediction. Specifically, our framework consists of a flow guided superpoint
generation module and a superpoint guided flow refinement module. In our
superpoint generation module, we utilize the bidirectional flow information at
the previous iteration to obtain the matching points of points and superpoint
centers for soft point-to-superpoint association construction, in which the
superpoints are generated for pairwise point clouds. With the generated
superpoints, we first reconstruct the flow for each point by adaptively
aggregating the superpoint-level flow, and then encode the consistency between
the reconstructed flow of pairwise point clouds. Finally, we feed the
consistency encoding along with the reconstructed flow into GRU to refine
point-level flow. Extensive experiments on several different datasets show that
our method can achieve promising performance.

overcoming nonlinear optical effects. To keep a smooth output beam, most
techniques for mitigating optical nonlinearities are restricted to single-mode

wavefront-shaping of coherent input light that is incident on a highly
multimode fiber can increase the power threshold for stimulated Brillouin

the output beam profile. The theory reveals that the suppression of SBS is due
to the relative weakness of intermodal scattering compared to intramodal

multimode excitation. Our method is efficient, robust, and applicable to
continuous waves and pulses. This work points toward a promising route for

$k$ approximations of large matrices. While ""large block"" Krylov methods with
block size at least $k$ give the best known theoretical guarantees, block size
one (a single vector) or a small constant is often preferred in practice.
Despite their popularity, we lack theoretical bounds on the performance of such
""small block"" Krylov methods for low-rank approximation.
  We address this gap between theory and practice by proving that small block
Krylov methods essentially match all known low-rank approximation guarantees
for large block methods. Via a black-box reduction we show, for example, that
the standard single vector Krylov method run for $t$ iterations obtains the
same spectral norm and Frobenius norm error bounds as a Krylov method with
block size $\ell \geq k$ run for $O(t/\ell)$ iterations, up to a logarithmic
dependence on the smallest gap between sequential singular values. That is, for
a given number of matrix-vector products, single vector methods are essentially
as effective as any choice of large block size.
  By combining our result with tail-bounds on eigenvalue gaps in random
matrices, we prove that the dependence on the smallest singular value gap can
be eliminated if the input matrix is perturbed by a small random matrix.
Further, we show that single vector methods match the more complex algorithm of

achieve an improved algorithm for Schatten $p$-norm low-rank approximation.

task due to the spherical geometry and the multimodality of the input, and the
inherent uncertainty and diversity of the output. Most previous methods fail to
give a complete treatment of these characteristics, and thus are prone to
errors. In this paper, we present a simple new criterion for scanpath
prediction based on principles from lossy data compression. This criterion
suggests minimizing the expected code length of quantized scanpaths in a
training set, which corresponds to fitting a discrete conditional probability
model via maximum likelihood. Specifically, the probability model is
conditioned on two modalities: a viewport sequence as the deformation-reduced
visual input and a set of relative historical scanpaths projected onto
respective viewports as the aligned path input. The probability model is
parameterized by a product of discretized Gaussian mixture models to capture
the uncertainty and the diversity of scanpaths from different users. Most
importantly, the training of the probability model does not rely on the
specification of ""ground-truth"" scanpaths for imitation learning. We also
introduce a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller-based sampler to
generate realistic human-like scanpaths from the learned probability model.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently produces better
quantitative scanpath results in terms of prediction accuracy (by comparing to
the assumed ""ground-truths"") and perceptual realism (through machine
discrimination) over a wide range of prediction horizons. We additionally
verify the perceptual realism improvement via a formal psychophysical

full-rank to low-rank training once the stable ranks of all layers have

reference orbits as an approximation. To validate the model, we compare the
analytical and numerical results in two main scenarios. First, in the case of
the Earth's static gravity field, both noise spectra are shown to agree well
with each other at various orbital inclinations and radii, confirming our
previous numerical work while providing more insight. Second, the model is
extended to incorporate the Earth's time-variable gravity. Particularly
relevant to TianQin, we augment the formulas to capture the disturbance from
the Earth's free oscillations triggered by earthquakes, of which the mode
frequencies enter TianQin's measurement band above 0.1 mHz. The analytical
model may find applications in gravity environment monitoring and
noise-reduction pipelines for TianQin.

  Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Wall Model","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.16427",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We develop a wall model for large-eddy simulation (LES) that takes into
account various pressure-gradient effects using multi-agent reinforcement
learning. The model is trained using low-Reynolds-number flow over periodic
hills with agents distributed on the wall at various computational grid points.
It utilizes a wall eddy-viscosity formulation as the boundary condition to
apply the modeled wall shear stress. Each agent receives states based on local
instantaneous flow quantities at an off-wall location, computes a reward based
on the estimated wall-shear stress, and provides an action to update the wall
eddy viscosity at each time step. The trained wall model is validated in
wall-modeled LES of flow over periodic hills at higher Reynolds numbers, and
the results show the effectiveness of the model on flow with pressure
gradients. The analysis of the trained model indicates that the model is
capable of distinguishing between the various pressure gradient regimes present
in the flow. To further assess the robustness of the developed wall model,
simulations of flow over the Boeing Gaussian bump are conducted at a Reynolds
number of $2\times 10^6$, based on the free-stream velocity and the bump width.
The results of mean skin friction and pressure on the bump surface, as well as
the velocity statistics of the flow field, are compared to those obtained from
equilibrium wall model (EQWM) simulations and published experimental data sets.
The developed wall model is found to successfully capture the acceleration and
deceleration of the turbulent boundary layer on the bump surface, providing
better predictions of skin friction near the bump peak and exhibiting
comparable performance to the EQWM with respect to the wall pressure and
velocity field. We also conclude that the subgrid-scale model is crucial to the
accurate prediction of the flow field, in particular the prediction of
separation.

a higher compression rate induces more loss of visual signals on the higher
frequency spectrum which reflect the details on pixel space. In this paper, a
Frequency Complement Module (FCM) architecture is proposed to capture the
missing frequency information for enhancing reconstruction quality. The FCM can
be easily incorporated into the VQ-VAE structure, and we refer to the new model
as Frequency Augmented VAE (FA-VAE). In addition, a Dynamic Spectrum Loss (DSL)
is introduced to guide the FCMs to balance between various frequencies
dynamically for optimal reconstruction. FA-VAE is further extended to the
text-to-image synthesis task, and a Cross-attention Autoregressive Transformer
(CAT) is proposed to obtain more precise semantic attributes in texts.
Extensive reconstruction experiments with different compression rates are
conducted on several benchmark datasets, and the results demonstrate that the
proposed FA-VAE is able to restore more faithfully the details compared to SOTA
methods. CAT also shows improved generation quality with better image-text

estimators currently used in practice simply ignore the interference, but in
doing so incur bias on the order of the treatment effect. We formalize the

Off-policy estimators, while unbiased, are impractically high variance. We
introduce a novel Monte-Carlo estimator, based on ""Differences-in-Qs"" (DQ)

contribution is to develop a generalized theory of Taylor expansions for policy

of initial seed atoms and radioactive $^{56}$Ni influenced by the mixing could
affect the formation of molecules. By comparing the calculations for spherical
cases and for several specified directions in the bipolar-like explosions in
the three-dimensional hydrodynamical models, the impact is discussed. The decay
of $^{56}$Ni, practically $^{56}$Co at later phases, could heat the gas and
delay the molecule formation. Additionally, Compton electrons produced by the
decay could ionize atoms and molecules and could destruct molecules. Several
chemical reactions involved with ions such as H$^+$ and He$^+$ could also
destruct molecules. The mixing of $^{56}$Ni plays a non-negligible role in both
the formation and destruction of molecules through the processes above. The
destructive processes of carbon monoxide and silicon monoxide due to the decay

learning based methods to effectively analyze legal judgments from Hong Kong's
Court System. The methods proposed consists of: (1) Citation Network Graph

Sentiment Polarity, and (5) Paragrah Classification, in order to be able to
extract key insights from individual as well a group of judgments together.

methods aiming to identify cryptojacking activities within Wasm code have
emerged. It is well-known that neural networks are susceptible to adversarial
attacks, where inputs to a classifier are perturbed with minimal changes that
result in a crass misclassification. While applying changes in image
classification is easy, manipulating binaries in an automated fashion to evade
malware classification without changing functionality is non-trivial. In this

R(Y) is the risk of an outcome, Y; T is a temperature variable; OT is optimal

the contextualized embedding of the [CLS] token. However, recent study shows
that the ordinary tokens besides [CLS] may provide extra information, which
help to produce a better representation effect. As such, it's necessary to
extend the current methods where all contextualized embeddings can be jointly
pre-trained for the retrieval tasks. In this work, we propose a novel
pre-training method called Duplex Masked Auto-Encoder, a.k.a. DupMAE. It is
designed to improve the quality of semantic representation where all

advantage of two complementary auto-encoding tasks: one reconstructs the input
sentence on top of the [CLS] embedding; the other one predicts the bag-of-words
feature of the input sentence based on the ordinary tokens' embeddings. The two
tasks are jointly conducted to train a unified encoder, where the whole
contextualized embeddings are aggregated in a compact way to produce the final
semantic representation. DupMAE is simple but empirically competitive: it
substantially improves the pre-trained model's representation capability and
transferability, where superior retrieval performances can be achieved on

shear-imposed Newtonian fluid flowing down an inclined slippery bed having an
insoluble surfactant at the top of the liquid surface. The Orr-Sommerfeld
boundary value problem is developed by applying the normal mode approach to the
infinitesimal perturbed fluid flow and solved using the numerical method
Chebyshev spectral collocation. The numerical results confirm the existence of
Yih mode and Marangoni mode in the longwave zone. For the clean/contaminated
surface of the film flow, the presence of an odd or Hall viscosity coefficient
reduces the surface wave energy and delays the transition from laminar to
perturbed flow. Also, it has stabilizing nature on the unstable Marangoni mode
as well. The growth rate of both clean and contaminated liquid surfaces becomes
more/less when the stronger external shear acts along the downstream/upstream
direction of fluid flow. Further, the slip parameter leads to a lower critical
Reynolds number and makes the liquid surface more unstable. An increase in the
critical Reynolds number due to the stronger Marangoni force ensures that the
insoluble surfactant has the potential to dampen the Yih mode instability.
Moreover, the unstable shear mode occurs in the finite wavenumber regime with
very high inertial force and a small angle of inclination. The two-fold
variation of the shear mode instability is possible with respect to the imposed
shear. However, the inclusion of the odd viscosity coefficient in the viscous
falling film may advance the shear mode instability.

position in expectation, there is a positive probability that the determinant
polynomial $\det(xI - \sum_{i=1}^n v_iv_i^\top)$ has roots bounded by $(1 +

can always find a partition of the vectors $v_1,\cdots,v_n$ into two sets with
a low discrepancy in terms of the spectral norm (in other words, rely on the

  In this paper, we provide two results for a broader class of polynomials, the
hyperbolic polynomials. Furthermore, our results are in two generalized

a transformer-based conditional Layout Denoiser is proposed to learn the
reverse diffusion process to generate samples from noised layout data.
Benefitting from both transformer and DDPM, our LayoutDM is of desired

colors to the vertices such that for every vertex there is a color that appears
exactly once in its open neighborhood. For a graph G, the smallest number of
colors required for such a coloring is called the conflict-free open
neighborhood (CFON) chromatic number and is denoted by \chi_{ON}(G).
Analogously, we define conflict-free closed neighborhood (CFCN) coloring, and
CFCN chromatic number (denoted by \chi_{CN}(G)). First studied in 2002, this
problem has received considerable attention.
  We study the CFON and CFCN coloring problems and show the following results.
In what follows, \Delta denotes the maximum degree of the graph.
  1. For a K_{1, k}-free graph G, we show that \chi_{ON}(G) = O(k \ln\Delta).
This improves the bound of O(k^2 \ln \Delta) from [Bhyravarapu,
Kalyanasundaram, Mathew, MFCS 2022]. Since \chi_{CN}(G) \leq 2\chi_{ON}(G), our
result implies an upper bound on \chi_{CN}(G) as well. It is known that there
exist separate classes of graphs with \chi_{ON}(G) = \Omega(\ln\Delta) and
\chi_{ON}(G) = \Omega(k).
  2. Let f(\delta) be defined as follows: f(\delta) = max {\chi_{CN} (G) : G is
a graph with minimum degree \delta}. It is easy to see that f(\delta') \geq
f(\delta) when \delta' < \delta. It is known [Debski and Przybylo, JGT 2021]
that f(c \Delta) = \Theta(\log \Delta), for any positive constant c. In this
paper, we show that f(c\Delta^{1 - \epsilon}) = \Omega (\ln^2 \Delta), where c,
\epsilon are positive constants such that \epsilon < 0.75. Together with the
known upper bound \chi_{CN}(G) = O(\ln^2 \Delta), this implies that
f(c\Delta^{1 - \epsilon}) = \Theta (\ln^2 \Delta).
  3. For a K_{1, k}-free graph G on n vertices, we show that \chi_{CN}(G) =
O(\ln k \ln n). This bound is asymptotically tight.

the expressivity of the multi-head attention layer that follows it. This is in
contrast to the common belief that LayerNorm's only role is to normalize the
activations during the forward pass, and their gradients during the backward
pass. We consider a geometric interpretation of LayerNorm and show that it
consists of two components: (a) projection of the input vectors to a $d-1$
space that is orthogonal to the $\left[1,1,...,1\right]$ vector, and (b)
scaling of all vectors to the same norm of $\sqrt{d}$. We show that each of
these components is important for the attention layer that follows it in
Transformers: (a) projection allows the attention mechanism to create an
attention query that attends to all keys equally, offloading the need to learn
this operation by the attention; and (b) scaling allows each key to potentially
receive the highest attention, and prevents keys from being ""un-select-able"".
We show empirically that Transformers do indeed benefit from these properties

Nevertheless, they divide the input image into multiple rectangular regions

causing waste of bitrate and distorted reconstruction of region boundaries. In
this paper, we propose to decouple an image into multiple groups with irregular

group mask describes the image at a finer granularity, enabling significant
bitrate saving by reducing the transmission of redundant content. Moreover, to
ensure the fidelity of selective reconstruction, this paper proposes the
concept of group-independent transform that maintain the independence among

implementation of quantum error correction requires negligible correlated
errors among qubits. Here, we realize ultra-coherent superconducting transmon
qubits based on niobium capacitor electrodes, with lifetimes exceeding 0.4 ms.
By employing a nearly quantum-limited readout chain based on a Josephson
traveling wave parametric amplifier, we are able to simultaneously record
bit-flip errors occurring in a multiple-qubit device, revealing that the
bit-flip errors in two highly coherent qubits are strongly correlated. By
introducing a novel time-resolved analysis synchronized with the operation of
the pulse tube cooler in a dilution refrigerator, we find that a pulse tube
mechanical shock causes nonequilibrium dynamics of the qubits, leading to
correlated bit-flip errors as well as transitions outside of the computational
state space. Our observations confirm that coherence improvements are still
attainable in transmon qubits based on the superconducting material that has
been commonly used in the field. In addition, our findings are consistent with
qubit dynamics induced by two-level systems and quasiparticles, deepening our
understanding of the qubit error mechanisms. Finally, these results inform

It is found that the peak frequency ($\nu_p$) distribution of the bursts of FRB

width distribution can be fitted with a log-normal function peaking at 0.35

different from the bimodal $E_{\rm \mu_{\rm c}}$ distribution of FRB 20121102A.

function can comparably reproduce the $E_{\rm \mu_{\rm c}}$ distribution of FRB

control interactions between newly installed PV inverters and previously

To achieve coordinated voltage regulation, current methods often rely on a

requiring OLTC to give up its existing tap switching logic and execute
corresponding upgrades. Aiming at bridging this gap, a soft coordination
framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the decision-making commands
are only applied on inverters, and OLTC that retains its own operation rule
will be indirectly controlled by the changed system voltage, which is a result
of appropriately adjusting inverters' Var output. The proposed method achieves
the soft coordination by establishing a modified actor-critic algorithm to
train a proxy model of inverters. The well-trained proxy model can properly
adjust inverters' Var output to ""softly"" coordinate OLTC's tap operations,
which finally attains coordinated voltage regulation and line loss
minimization. Simulation results verify the superiority of our proposed method

observed with the FAST and Arecibo telescopes at $L$ band and the GBT telescope
at $C$ band, we investigate these puzzles through Monte Carlo simulations. The
intrinsic energy function (E-function) is modeled as $dp/dE\propto
E^{-\alpha_{\rm E}}$, and the spectral profile is described as a Gaussian
function. A fringe pattern of its spectral peak frequency ($\nu_{\rm p}$) in
0.5-8 GHz is inferred from the $\nu_{\rm p}$ distribution of the GBT sample. We
estimate the likelihood of $\alpha_{\rm E}$ and the standard deviation of the
spectral profile ($\sigma_{\rm s}$) by utilizing the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (K-S)
test probability for the observed and simulated specific E-distributions. Our
simulations yields $\alpha_{\rm E}=1.82^{+0.10}_{-0.30}$ and $\sigma_{\rm

These results suggest that a single power-law function is adequate to model the

and E-distributions with telescopes in different frequency ranges are due to
both physical and observational reasons, i.e. narrow spectral width for a
single burst and discrete $\nu_{p}$ fringe pattern in a broad frequency range
among bursts, and the selection effects of the telescope bandpass and
sensitivity. The putative $\nu_{p}$ fringe pattern cannot be explained with the

intelligent surface (TRIS) transmitter. In order to achieve low power
consumption and high-rate multi-streams communication, time-modulated arrays
(TMA) is implemented and users access the network using rate splitting multiple
access (RSMA). With such a network framework, a multi-objective optimization
problem with joint design of the precoding matrix and the common stream rate is
constructed to achieve higher energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency
(SE). Since the objective function is a non-convex fractional function, we
proposed a joint optimization algorithm based on difference-of-convex (DC)
programming and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical results show
that under this framework the proposed algorithm can considerably improve and
balance the EE and SE.

during either growth or operating process. Current theories of studying the
illumination effects on defects usually have the assumption of unaffected
formation energies of neutral defects as well as defect transition energy
levels, and use the quasi-Fermi levels to describe behaviors of excess carriers
with conclusions at variance. In this work, we first propose a method to
simulate steady illumination conditions, based on which we demonstrate that
formation energies of neutral defects and defect transition energy levels are
insensitive to illumination. Then, we show that optical and thermal excitation
of electrons can be seen equivalent with each other to reach a steady electron
distribution in a homogeneous semiconductor. Consequently, the electron
distribution can be characterized using just one effective temperature T' and
one universal Fermi level E_F' for a homogeneous semiconductor under continuous
and steady illuminations, which can be seen as a combination of
quasi-equilibrium electron system with T' and a lattice system with T. Using
the new concepts, we uncover the universal mechanisms of illumination effects
on charged defects by treating the band edge states explicitly in the same
footing as the defect states. We find that the formation energies of band edge
'defect' states shift with increased T' of electrons, thus affecting the E_F',
changing defect ionic probabilities, and affecting concentrations of charged
defects. We apply our theory to study the illumination effects on the doping
behaviors in GaN:Mg and CdTe:Sb, obtaining results in accordance with
experimental observations. More interesting experimental defect-related
phenomena under steady illuminations are expected to be understood from our

sequential programs. It provides a balance between efficiency and effectiveness
by conducting a biased random search over the domain of program inputs using a
feedback function from observed test executions. For distributed system
testing, however, the state-of-practice is represented today by only black-box
tools that do not attempt to infer and exploit any knowledge of the system's
past behaviours to guide the search for bugs.
  In this work, we present Mallory: the first framework for grey-box
fuzz-testing of distributed systems. Unlike popular black-box distributed
system fuzzers, such as Jepsen, that search for bugs by randomly injecting
network partitions and node faults or by following human-defined schedules,
Mallory is adaptive. It exercises a novel metric to learn how to maximize the
number of observed system behaviors by choosing different sequences of faults,
thus increasing the likelihood of finding new bugs. The key enablers for our
approach are the new ideas of timeline-driven testing and timeline abstraction
that provide the feedback function guiding a biased random search for failures.
Mallory dynamically constructs Lamport timelines of the system behaviour,
abstracts these timelines into happens-before summaries, and introduces faults
guided by its real-time observation of the summaries.
  We have evaluated Mallory on a diverse set of widely-used industrial
distributed systems. Compared to the start-of-the-art black-box fuzzer Jepsen,
Mallory explores more behaviours and takes less time to find bugs. Mallory
discovered 22 zero-day bugs (of which 18 were confirmed by developers),
including 10 new vulnerabilities, in rigorously-tested distributed systems such
as Braft, Dqlite, and Redis. 6 new CVEs have been assigned.

which takes days or weeks for a large amount of data. Recently,
backward-compatible training (BCT) enables the new model to be immediately

introduce AdvBCT, an Adversarial Backward-Compatible Training method with an
elastic boundary constraint that takes both compatibility and discrimination
into consideration. We first employ adversarial learning to minimize the
distribution disparity between embeddings of the new model and the old model.
Meanwhile, we add an elastic boundary constraint during training to improve
compatibility and discrimination efficiently. Extensive experiments on GLDv2,

general-purpose AI assistants in daily life, their subtly unethical suggestions
become a serious and real concern. Tackling the challenge of automatically

  This paper introduces the first framework for testing and repairing unethical
suggestions made by LLMs. We first propose ETHICSSUITE, a test suite that
presents complex, contextualized, and realistic moral scenarios to test LLMs.
We then propose a novel suggest-critic-reflect (SCR) process, serving as an
automated test oracle to detect unethical suggestions. We recast deciding if
LLMs yield unethical suggestions (a hard problem; often requiring human
expertise and costly to decide) into a PCR task that can be automatically
checked for violation. Moreover, we propose a novel on-the-fly (OTF) repairing
scheme that repairs unethical suggestions made by LLMs in real-time. The OTF
scheme is applicable to LLMs in a black-box API setting with moderate cost.
With ETHICSSUITE, our study on seven popular LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4)
uncovers in total 109,824 unethical suggestions. We apply our OTF scheme on two
LLMs (Llama-13B and ChatGPT), which generates valid repair to a considerable
amount of unethical ones, paving the way for more ethically conscious LLMs.

accretion rate for all the sources and find that the observed luminosity
follows a nearly linear relation with the mass accretion rate. The ratio of
X-ray luminosity from the disk to the corona increases with the mass accretion

However, TDE AT2018fyk shows a positive correlation at higher luminosity and
shows a better fit when a simple spherical adiabatic outflow model is added to

at a higher mass accretion rate, we show that the accretion models without a

  Presence of Latent Confounders",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Causal Discovery with latent variables, We define two data paradigms:
definite data: a single-skeleton structure with observed nodes single-value,
and indefinite data: a set of multi-skeleton structures with observed nodes
multi-value. Multi,skeletons induce low sample utilization and multi values
induce incapability of the distribution assumption, both leading that
recovering causal relations from indefinite data is, as of yet, largely
unexplored. We design the causal strength variational model to settle down
these two problems. Specifically, we leverage the causal strength instead of
independent noise as latent variable to mediate evidence lower bound. By this
design ethos, The causal strength of different skeletons is regarded as a
distribution and can be expressed as a single-valued causal graph matrix.
Moreover, considering the latent confounders, we disentangle the causal graph G
into two relatisubgraphs O and C. O contains pure relations between observed
nodes, while C represents the relations from latent variables to observed
nodes. We summarize the above designs as Confounding Disentanglement Causal
Discovery (biCD), which is tailored to learn causal representation from
indefinite data under the latent confounding. Finally, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

of the irradiated material using a tightly focused laser beam or in a
self-ordered way that allows employing larger laser beam diameters along with
areal scanning to create a variety of laser-induced periodic surface structures

recently pushed the borders across long-lasting limitations regarding the

times. This chapter reviews the plethora of recently investigated applications
of LIPSS-for example, via imposing diffractive or plasmonic structural colors,
the management of liquids and surface wetting properties, biomedical and
bioinspired functionalities, beneficial effects in tribology for reducing
friction and wear, the manipulation of optical scattering and absorption in

actuators with locally adjusted mechanical properties is demonstrated in
comparison to homogenous actuators with the same geometry. As demonstraction

substantial barrier for the thousands of neuroscientists and clinical

  We introduce Neuralizer, a single model that generalizes to previously unseen
neuroimaging tasks and modalities without the need for re-training or

in a single forward pass during inference. The model can solve processing tasks

detected. The amplitude vector can be detected by exhaustive search, whose
complexity is still sufficiently low in short packet transmissions. For
detection of the PSK vector, we adopt a maximum-A-posteriori (MAP) criterion to
improve the reliability of the sorted decision-feedback differential detection
(sort-DFDD), which results in near-optimal error performance in the case of the
same modulation order of the transmit PSK symbols at different time slots. This
detector is called MAP-based-reliability-sort-DFDD (MAP-R-sort-DFDD) and has
polynomial complexity. For the case of different modulation orders at different

have a significant impact on the detection of PSK symbols with higher

called improved-MAP-R-sort-DFDD, which approaches the optimal error performance
with polynomial time complexity. Simulation results show the merits of our
proposed multi-symbol unitary constellation when compared to competing

uncertainties in the observed cloud-level wind and the polar radius, translate
to an uncertainty in the shape with the same order of magnitude. The Juno

measurements, constraining better the uncertainty in the wind structure. Using
an accurate shape calculation, and a joint optimization, given both gravity and

height for both planets. We find that for Saturn there is an excellent match to
the radio-occultation measurements, while at Jupiter such a match is not

numerical computation of rate-distortion (RD) functions. This algorithm

novel modification of the BA algorithm, letting the multiplier be updated in
each iteration via a one-dimensional root-finding step with respect to a
monotonic univariate function, which can be efficiently implemented by Newton's
method. This allows the multiplier to be updated in a flexible and efficient
manner, overcoming a major drawback of the original BA algorithm wherein the
multiplier is fixed throughout iterations. Consequently, the modified algorithm
is capable of directly computing the RD function for a given target distortion,
without exploring the entire RD curve as in the original BA algorithm. A
theoretical analysis shows that the modified algorithm still converges to the
RD function and the convergence rate is $\Theta(1/n)$, where $n$ denotes the

allocation algorithms for uplink cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X)
communication for OFDMA based 5G systems. In C-V2X, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)
users share radio resources with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) users.
Existing works primarily focus on the optimal pairing of V2V and V2I users
under the assumption that each V2I user needs a single resource block (RB);
minimizing any interference through power allocation. In contrast, in this
work, we have considered that the number of RBs needed by the users is a
function of their channel condition and Quality of Service (QoS) - a method
called link adaptation. It is effective in compensating for the incessant
channel quality fluctuations at the high frequencies of operation of 5G.
  The first proposed resource allocation scheme of this work greedily allocates
RBs to V2I users using link adaptation and then uses Hungarian algorithm to
pair V2V with V2I users, while minimizing interference through power
allocation. To reduce the complexity, the second scheme groups RBs into
resource chunks (RCs); then uses Hungarian algorithm twice - first to allocate
RCs to V2I users, and then to pair V2I users with V2V users. Extensive
simulations reveal that link adaptation increases the number of satisfied V2I
users as well as their sum-rate, while also improving QoS of individual users,
thereby making it indispensable for C-V2X system. We have also considered the
presence of best-effort users, and the diverse QoS has been provided through
the multi-numerology frame structure of 5G.

closure (topological) defects associated with tag-spins attached to the
vertices of the graph. For such states, we generalise the bulk-to-boundary
mapping as to include the space of tags in an extended boundary space: bulk
information is shared among generically entangled boundary surfaces and
intrinsic curvature degrees of freedom. We model the quantum region on a
tripartite system composed by two (complementary) boundary subregions and the
set of bulk tags. Via replica techniques, we can compute the typical value of
the logarithmic negativity of the reduced boundary, described as an open
quantum system, in a large spin regime. We find three entanglement regimes,
depending on the ratio between the number of tags (curvature) and the area of
the dual surface at the boundary. These are well described by the generalised
Page curve of a tripartite random state. In particular, we find area scaling
behaviour for negativity in case of small curvature, while for large curvature
the negativity vanishes, suggesting an effective thermalization of the
boundary. Remarkably, the PPT character of the mixed boundary state corresponds
to a change in the effective topology of the network, with the two boundary
subregions becoming disconnected.

involved in the action or the background are changed. Humans can abstract away
the action from the appearance of the objects and their context which is
referred to as compositionality of actions. Compositional action recognition
deals with imparting human-like compositional generalization abilities to
action-recognition models. In this regard, extracting the interactions between
humans and objects forms the basis of compositional understanding. These
interactions are not affected by the appearance biases of the objects or the
context. But the context provides additional cues about the interactions
between things and stuff. Hence we need to infuse context into the human-object
interactions for compositional action recognition. To this end, we first design
a spatial-temporal interaction encoder that captures the human-object (things)
interactions. The encoder learns the spatio-temporal interaction tokens
disentangled from the background context. The interaction tokens are then
infused with contextual information from the video tokens to model the
interactions between things and stuff. The final context-infused
spatio-temporal interaction tokens are used for compositional action
recognition. We show the effectiveness of our interaction-centric approach on
the compositional Something-Else dataset where we obtain a new state-of-the-art
result of 83.8% top-1 accuracy outperforming recent important object-centric
methods by a significant margin. Our approach of explicit human-object-stuff
interaction modeling is effective even for standard action recognition datasets

driven forces, namely a particle moving on a rotating-parabola system, and
study the effect of two-frequency forcing with a wide difference in the
frequencies. We report that the system exhibits vibrational resonance in a

transformation of directions into learned shading frames -- facilitates

This paper proposes a rigorous permutation test to assess the credibility of

measure of goodness of fit, without the need for sample splitting, by
generating new pairings of $(X_i, Y_j)$ and providing an overall interpretation

underscores how the available information affects the test, showing that the
less informative the predictors, the lower the probability of rejecting the
null hypothesis, and emphasizing that detecting weaker dependence between

magnetic properties with different field induced magnetic transitions. The
deuteride is ferrimagnetic at low temperature and the Er and Fe sublattices
present magnetic transitions at different temperatures. The Er moments are
ordered below T$_{Er}$=55 K, whereas the Fe moments remain ferromagnetically
coupled up to T$_{M0}$ = 66 K. At T$_{M0}$ the Fe moments display a sharp
ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic transition (FM-AFM) through an itinerant
electron metamagnetic (IEM) behaviour very sensitive to any volume change.
Y$_{0.7}$Er$_{0.3}$Fe$_2$D$_{4.2}$ becomes paramagnetic above T$_N$=125 K. The
pressure dependence of T$_{Er}$ and T$_{M0}$ have been extracted from magnetic
measurements under hydrostatic pressure up to 0.49 GPa. Both temperatures
decrease linearly upon applied pressure with dT$_{Er}$/dP=-126 and dTM0/dP=-140
K.GPa$^{-1}$ for a field of B=0.03 T. Both magnetic Er and ferromagnetic Fe
order disappear at P=0.44(4) GPa. However, under a larger applied field B=5 T,
dT$_{M0}$/dP=-156 K.GPa$^{-1}$ whereas dT$_{Er}$/dP=-134 K.GPa$^{-1}$ showing a
weaker sensitivity to pressure and magnetic field. At 2 K the decrease of the
saturation magnetization under pressure can be attributed to a reduction of the
mean Er moment due to canting and/or crystal field effect. Above T$_{M0}$ the
magnetization curves display a metamagnetic behaviour from AFM to FM state,
which is also very sensitive to the applied pressure. The transition field
B$_{trans}$, which increases linearly upon heating, is shifted to lower
temperature upon applied pressure with dT=-17 K between 0 and 0.11 GPa. These
results show a strong decoupling of the Er and Fe magnetic sublattices versus
temperature, applied field and pressure.

clusters form within parsec-scale over-densities of interstellar molecular gas
called clumps, it is, however, unclear whether these clumps represent the
high-density tip of a continuous gaseous flow that gradually leads towards the
formation of stars, or a transition within the gas physical properties. Here,
we present a unique analysis of a sample of 27 infrared dark clouds embedded
within 24 individual molecular clouds that combine a large set of observations,
allowing us to compute the mass and velocity dispersion profiles of each, from
the scale of tens of parsecs down to the scale of tenths of a parsec. These
profiles reveal that the vast majority of the clouds, if not all, are
self-gravitating on all scales, and that the clumps, on parsec-scale, are often
dynamically decoupled from their surrounding molecular clouds, exhibiting
steeper density profiles ($\rho\propto r^{-2}$) and flat velocity dispersion
profiles ($\sigma\propto r^0$), clearly departing from Larson's relations.
These findings suggest that the formation of star clusters correspond to a
transition regime within the properties of the self-gravitating molecular gas.
We propose that this transition regime is one that corresponds to the
gravitational collapse of parsec-scale clumps within stable molecular clouds.

destroys the existence of a fourth motion constant in the

integrator is used to show that the motion of neutral particles can be chaotic
under some circumstances. When test particles have electric charges, their
motions are subject to an electromagnetic field surrounding the black hole as
well as the gravitational forces from the black hole and the magnetic field. It
is found that increasing both the magnetic field and the particle energy or
decreasing the particle angular momentum can strengthen the degree of chaos
regardless of whether the particles are neutral or charged. The effect of
varying the black hole positive charge on the dynamical transition from order
to chaos is associated with the electric charges of particles. The dynamical
transition of neutral particles has no sensitive dependence on a change of the
black hole charge. An increase of the black hole charge weakens the chaoticity
of positive charged particles, whereas enhances the chaoticity of negative

because many relevant problems involve maximizing or minimizing ratio terms.
Notice that the maximization case and the minimization case of FP cannot be
converted to each other in general, so they have to be dealt with separately in
most of the previous studies. Thus, an existing FP method for maximizing ratios
typically does not work for the minimization case, and vice versa. However, the
FP objective can be mixed max-and-min, e.g., one may wish to maximize the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the legitimate receiver while
minimizing that of the eavesdropper. We aim to fill the gap between max-FP and
min-FP by devising a unified optimization framework. The main results are
three-fold. First, we extend the existing max-FP technique called quadratic
transform to the min-FP, and further develop a full generalization for the
mixed case. Second. we provide a minorization-maximization (MM) interpretation
of the proposed unified approach, thereby establishing its convergence and also
obtaining a matrix extension; another result we obtain is a generalized
Lagrangian dual transform which facilitates the solving of the logarithmic FP.
Finally, we present three typical applications: the age-of-information (AoI)
minimization, the Cramer-Rao bound minimization for sensing, and the secure
data rate maximization, none of which can be efficiently addressed by the
previous FP methods.

exist in at least two different polytypes, $\alpha$-GaGeTe ($R\bar{3}m$) and
$\beta$-GaGeTe ($P6_3 mc$). Here we report a joint experimental and theoretical
study of the structural, vibrational, and electronic properties of these two
polytypes at high pressure. Both polytypes show anisotropic compressibility and
two phase transitions, above 7 and 15 GPa, respectively, as confirmed by XRD
and Raman spectroscopy measurements. Although the nature of the high-pressure
phases is not confirmed, comparison with other chalcogenides and total-energy
calculations allow us to propose possible high-pressure phases for both
polytypes with an increase in coordination for Ga and Ge atoms from 4 to 6. In
particular, the simplification of the X-ray patterns for both polytypes above
15 GPa suggests a transition to a structure of relatively higher symmetry than
the original one. This result is consistent with the rocksalt-like
high-pressure phases observed in parent III-VI semiconductors, such as GaTe,
GaSe, and InSe. Pressure-induced amorphization is observed upon pressure
release. The electronic band structures of $\alpha$-GaGeTe and $\beta$-GaGeTe
and their pressure dependence also show similarities to III-VI semiconductors,
thus suggesting that the germanene-like sublayer induces a semimetallic
character in both GaGeTe polytypes. Above 3 GPa, both polytypes lose their
topological features, due to the opening of the direct band gap, while the
reduction of the interlayer space increases the thermal conductivity at high
pressure.

differential equations (PDEs) with physical boundary or interface conditions.
Semi-discretisation of such problems does not necessarily yield Hamiltonian
dynamics and even alters the Hamiltonian structure of the dynamics when
boundary and interface conditions are included. This seemingly intractable
issue can be resolved by using a recently introduced Schr\""odingerisation
method (Jin et al. 2022) -- it converts any linear PDEs and ODEs with
non-Hermitian dynamics to a system of Schr\""odinger equations, via the
so-called warped phase transformation that maps the equation into one higher
dimension. We implement this method for several typical problems, including the
linear convection equation with inflow boundary conditions and the heat
equation with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. For interface
problems, we study the (parabolic) Stefan problem, linear convection, and
linear Liouville equations with discontinuous and even measure-valued
coefficients. We perform numerical experiments to demonstrate the validity of
this approach, which helps to bridge the gap between available quantum
algorithms and computational models for classical and quantum dynamics with
boundary and interface conditions.

begin by disputing a recent suggestion that nuclear quantum effects may lead to
a broadening of polariton bands, finding instead that they merely result in
anharmonic red shifts in the polariton frequencies. We go on to show that our
simulated cavity spectra can be reproduced to graphical accuracy with a
harmonic model that uses just the cavity-free spectrum and the geometry of the
cavity as input. We end by showing that this harmonic model can be combined
with the experimental cavity-free spectrum to give results in good agreement
with optical cavity measurements. Since the input to our harmonic model is
equivalent to the input to the transfer matrix method of applied optics, we
conclude that cavity molecular dynamics cannot provide any more insight into
the effect of vibrational strong coupling on the absorption spectrum than this
transfer matrix method, which is already widely used by experimentalists to
corroborate their cavity results.

has important observational implications because high-redshift galaxy samples
are rest-UV selected and therefore particularly sensitive to the recent star
formation. Using a suite of cosmological ""zoom-in"" simulations at $z>5$ from
the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, we examine the
implications of bursty star formation histories for observations of
high-redshift galaxies with JWST. We characterize how the galaxy observability
depends on the star formation history. We also investigate selection effects
due to bursty star formation on the physical properties measured, such as the
gas fraction, specific star formation rate, and metallicity. We find the
observability to be highly time-dependent for galaxies near the survey's
limiting flux due to the SFR variability: as the star formation rate
fluctuates, the same galaxy oscillates in and out of the observable sample. The
observable fraction $f_\mathrm{obs} \sim 50\%$ at $M_{*} \sim 10^{8.5}$ to
$10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ for a JWST/NIRCam survey reaching a limiting magnitude of

JADES-Medium and CEERS. JWST-detectable galaxies near the survey limit tend to
have properties characteristic of galaxies in the bursty phase: they show
10$-$30% higher cold, dense gas fractions and 80$-$100% higher specific star
formation rates at a given stellar mass than galaxies below the rest-UV
detection threshold. Our study represents a first step in quantifying selection
effects and associated biases due to bursty star formation in studying

real-time analysis of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) videos.
During the biopsy process of lung cancer, physicians use real-time ultrasound
images to find suitable lesion locations for sampling. However, most of these
images are difficult to classify and contain a lot of noise. Previous studies
have employed 2D convolutional neural networks to effectively differentiate
between benign and malignant lung lesions, but doctors still need to manually
select good-quality images, which can result in additional labor costs. In
addition, the 2D neural network has no ability to capture the temporal
information of the ultrasound video, so it is difficult to obtain the
relationship between the features of the continuous images. This study designs
an automatic diagnosis system based on a 3D neural network, uses the SlowFast
architecture as the backbone to fuse temporal and spatial features, and uses
the SwAV method of contrastive learning to enhance the noise robustness of the
model. The method we propose includes the following advantages, such as (1)
using clinical ultrasound films as model input, thereby reducing the need for
high-quality image selection by physicians, (2) high-accuracy classification of
benign and malignant lung lesions can assist doctors in clinical diagnosis and
reduce the time and risk of surgery, and (3) the capability to classify well
even in the presence of significant image noise. The AUC, accuracy, precision,
recall and specificity of our proposed method on the validation set reached

properties in random graphs, Friedgut, Kohayakawa, R\""odl, Ruci\'nski and
Tetali introduced two variants of a single-player game whose goal is to colour
the edges of a~random graph, in an online fashion, so as not to create a
monochromatic triangle. In the two-round variant of the game, the player is
first asked to find a triangle-free colouring of the edges of a random graph
$G_1$ and then extend this colouring to a triangle-free colouring of the union
of $G_1$ and another (independent) random graph $G_2$, which is disclosed to
the player only after they have coloured $G_1$. Friedgut et al.\ analysed this
variant of the online Ramsey game in two instances: when $G_1$ has
$\Theta(n^{4/3})$ edges and when the number of edges of $G_1$ is just below the
threshold above which a random graph typically no longer admits a triangle-free
colouring, which is located at $\Theta(n^{3/2})$.
  The two-round Ramsey game has been recently revisited by Conlon, Das, Lee and
M\'esz\'aros, who generalised the result of Friedgut at al.\ from triangles to
all strictly $2$-balanced graphs. We extend the work of Friedgut et al.\ in an
orthogonal direction and analyse the triangle case of the two-round Ramsey game
at all intermediate densities. More precisely, for every $n^{-4/3} \ll p \ll
n^{-1/2}$, with the exception of $p = \Theta(n^{-3/5})$, we determine the
threshold density $q$ at which it becomes impossible to extend any
triangle-free colouring of a typical $G_1 \sim G_{n,p}$ to a triangle-free
colouring of the union of $G_1$ and $G_2 \sim G_{n,q}$. An interesting aspect
of our result is that this threshold density $q$ `jumps' by a polynomial

The homogeneous vacuum Kasner solution was chosen as a reference anisotropic
cosmological model because there are no effects caused by inhomogeneity in this
simple model with a constant degree of anisotropy. This anisotropy cannot
become weak. The study of its geodesic structure made it possible to clarify
the properties of this space-time. It showed that the degree of manifestation
of anisotropy varies significantly depending on the travel time of the light
from the observed object. For nearby objects, for which it does not exceed half
the age of the universe, the manifestations of anisotropy are very small.
Distant objects show more pronounced manifestations, for example, in the
distribution of objects over the sky and over photometric distances. These
effects for each of the individual objects decrease with time, but in general,
the manifestations of anisotropy in the Kasner space-time remain constant due
to the fact that new sources emerging from beyond the cosmological horizon.We
analyse observable signatures of the Kasner-type anisotropy and compare it to
observations. These effects were not found in astronomical observations,
including the study of the CMB. We can assume that the Universe has always been
isotropic or almost isotropic since the recombination era. This does not
exclude the possibility of its significant anisotropy at the moment of the Big
Bang followed by rapid isotropization during the inflationary epoch.

disincentivising the participation of clients who benefit little from FL. Fair
FL reduces accuracy disparity by focusing on clients with higher losses while
personalisation locally fine-tunes the model. Personalisation provides a
participation incentive when an FL model underperforms relative to one trained
locally. For situations where the federated model provides a lower accuracy
than a model trained entirely locally by a client, personalisation improves the
accuracy of the pre-trained federated weights to be similar to or exceed those
of the local client model. This paper evaluates two Fair FL (FFL) algorithms as
starting points for personalisation. Our results show that FFL provides no
benefit to relative performance in a language task and may double the number of
underperforming clients for an image task. Instead, we propose
Personalisation-aware Federated Learning (PaFL) as a paradigm that
pre-emptively uses personalisation losses during training. Our technique shows
a 50% reduction in the number of underperforming clients for the language task

of doubling it. Thus, evidence indicates that it may allow a broader set of

quantum machine learning (QML), the study of machine learning algorithms
running natively on quantum computers. Such algorithms have begun to be applied
to data intensive problems in particle physics, driven by the expected
increased capacity for pattern recognition of quantum computers. In this work
we develop and apply QML methods to B meson flavour tagging, an important
component of experiments in particle physics which probe heavy quark mixing and
CP violation in order to obtain a better understanding of the matter-antimatter
asymmetry observed in the universe. We simulate boosted ensembles of quantum
support vector machines (QSVMs) based on both conventional qubit-based and
continuous variable architectures, attaining effective tagging efficiencies of
28.0% and 29.2% respectively, comparable with the leading published result of
30.0% using classical machine learning algorithms. The ensemble nature of our
classifier is of particular importance, doubling the effective tagging
efficiency of a single QSVM, which we find to be highly prone to overfitting.
These results are obtained despite the strong constraint of working with QSVM
architectures that are classically simulable, and we find evidence that
continuous variable QSVMs beyond the classically simulable regime may be able
to realise even higher performance, surpassing the reported classical results,
when sufficiently powerful quantum hardware is developed to execute them.

conditions and monitor heart function. The accurate classification of ECG
signals is crucial for the early detection and treatment of heart-related
diseases. This paper proposes a novel approach based on an improved
differential evolution (DE) algorithm for ECG signal classification. To this
end, after the preprocessing step, we extracted several features such as BPM,
IBI, and SDNN. Then, the features are fed into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).
While MLPs are still widely used for ECG signal classification, using
gradient-based training methods, the most widely used algorithm for the
training process, has significant disadvantages, such as the possibility of
being stuck in local optimums. Population-based metaheuristic techniques have
been effectively used to address this. This paper employs an enhanced
differential evolution (DE) algorithm for the training process as one of the
most effective population-based algorithms. To this end, we improved DE based
on a clustering-based strategy, opposition-based learning, and a local search.
Clustering-based strategies can act as crossover operators, while the goal of
the opposition operator is to improve the exploration of the DE algorithm. The
weights and biases found by the improved DE algorithm are then fed into six
gradient-based local search algorithms. In other words, the weights found by
the DE are employed as an initialization point. Therefore, we introduced six
different algorithms for the training process (in terms of different local
search algorithms). In an extensive set of experiments, we showed that our
proposed training algorithm could provide better results than the conventional
training algorithms.

Weakly-supervised expression spotting (WES) based on video-level labels can

fine-grained frame-level spotting. However, we argue that existing
weakly-supervised methods are based on multiple instance learning (MIL)
involving inter-modality, inter-sample, and inter-task gaps. The inter-sample
gap is primarily from the sample distribution and duration. Therefore, we
propose a novel and simple WES framework, MC-WES, using multi-consistency
collaborative mechanisms that include modal-level saliency, video-level
distribution, label-level duration and segment-level feature consistency
strategies to implement fine frame-level spotting with only video-level labels
to alleviate the above gaps and merge prior knowledge. The modal-level saliency
consistency strategy focuses on capturing key correlations between raw images
and optical flow. The video-level distribution consistency strategy utilizes
the difference of sparsity in temporal distribution. The label-level duration
consistency strategy exploits the difference in the duration of facial muscles.
The segment-level feature consistency strategy emphasizes that features under
the same labels maintain similarity. Experimental results on two challenging
datasets -- CAS(ME)$^2$ and SAMM-LV -- demonstrate that MC-WES is comparable to
state-of-the-art fully-supervised methods.

conventional metallic Drude response. The pressure dependence of this
low-energy peak reflects the re-entrant behavior of superconductivity and may
be interpreted in terms of electron-phonon coupling, varying with the growth

low-energy interband absorptions are observed upon the suppression of CDW.
These changes are related to the upward shift of the Sb2 $p_x+p_y$ band that

a set of models on datasets collected from different domains. Conventional

limited availability of annotated data in each domain considerably hinders the
effectiveness of conventional supervised MDL approaches in real-world
applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel method called multi-domain
contrastive learning (MDCL) to alleviate the impact of insufficient annotations
by capturing both semantic and structural information from both labeled and
unlabeled data.Specifically, MDCL comprises two modules: inter-domain semantic
alignment and intra-domain contrast. The former aims to align annotated
instances of the same semantic category from distinct domains within a shared
hidden space, while the latter focuses on learning a cluster structure of
unlabeled instances in a private hidden space for each domain. MDCL is readily
compatible with many SP models, requiring no additional model parameters and
allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results across five textual and
image multi-domain datasets demonstrate that MDCL brings noticeable improvement
over various SP models.Furthermore, MDCL can further be employed in
multi-domain active learning (MDAL) to achieve a superior initialization,
eventually leading to better overall performance.

research line, graph contrastive learning (GCL) has exhibited powerful
performance in addressing the supervision label shortage issue by learning
augmented user and item representations. While many of them show their
effectiveness, two key questions still remain unexplored: i) Most existing
GCL-based CF models are still limited by ignoring the fact that user-item
interaction behaviors are often driven by diverse latent intent factors (e.g.,
shopping for family party, preferred color or brand of products); ii) Their
introduced non-adaptive augmentation techniques are vulnerable to noisy

incorporating misleading self-supervised signals. In light of these
limitations, we propose a Disentangled Contrastive Collaborative Filtering
framework (DCCF) to realize intent disentanglement with self-supervised
augmentation in an adaptive fashion. With the learned disentangled
representations with global context, our DCCF is able to not only distill
finer-grained latent factors from the entangled self-supervision signals but
also alleviate the augmentation-induced noise. Finally, the cross-view

derivations of $R_b+W_{o}$ from the TL equation do not correctly account for
current conservation at the electrode-reservoir interface but that correcting
this shortcoming leads to the same impedance. We also show that $W_{o}$ and
$W_{s}$ can be derived directly from their corresponding ladder circuits,
completely bypassing the TL equation. These circuits for the charging of
electrolyte-filled pores are based on the assumption that equipotential lines
in the pores are straight, which is not the case near the pore entrance and
end. To determine the importance of these regions, we numerically simulated the
charging of electrolyte-filled pores of different lengths $\ell_p$ and radii
$\rho_p$ through the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. We find that pores with
aspect ratios beyond $\ell_p/\rho_p\gtrapprox5$ have impedances in good
agreement with $W_{o}$. The impedance of shorter pores tends towards that of a
pure capacitance.

Additionally, modeling errors and external disturbances can lead to deviations

a novel approach to computing time-optimal trajectories, by fixing the nodes

  The symmetries of two-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) can be
formalised as chiral algebras, vertex operator algebras or nets of observable
algebras. Their representation categories are abelian categories having
additional structures, which are induced by properties of conformal blocks,
i.e. of vector bundles over the moduli space of curves with marked points,
which can be constructed from the symmetry structure.
  These mathematical notions pertain to the description of chiral CFTs. In a
full local CFT one deals in addition with correlators, which are specific
elements in the spaces of conformal blocks. In fact, a full CFT is the same as
a consistent system of correlators for arbitrary conformal surfaces with any
number and type of field insertions in the bulk as well as on boundaries and on
topological defect lines. We present algebraic structures that allow one to

clinical medicine. However, the acquisitions of some modalities, such as the

motion artifacts. On the other hand, the T1-weighted image (T1WI) shares the
same underlying information with T2-weighted image (T2WI), which needs a
shorter scanning time. Therefore, in this paper we accelerate the acquisition
of the T2WI by introducing the auxiliary modality (T1WI). Concretely, we first
reconstruct high-quality T2WIs with under-sampled T2WIs. Here, we realize fast
T2WI reconstruction by reducing the sampling rate in the k-space. Second, we
establish a cross-modal synthesis task to generate the synthetic T2WIs for
guiding better T2WI reconstruction. Here, we obtain the synthetic T2WIs by
decomposing the whole cross-modal generation mapping into two OT processes, the
spatial alignment mapping on the T1 image manifold and the cross-modal
synthesis mapping from aligned T1WIs to T2WIs. It overcomes the negative
transfer caused by the spatial misalignment. Then, we prove the reconstruction

Earthquake detection is
an important scientific challenge, not only for its social impacts, but also
since it reflects the actual degree of understanding of the physical processes
controlling seismic events. We propose an approach for evaluating and
understanding the dynamics of seismic events. The approach is based on the
phase between the waveform signals of many stations, enabling detecting the
evolution of relatively small magnitudes, down to Mw 1.3. We constructed a
time-evolving network in which the network nodes are the stations, while the
links are the level of correspondence between the stations' signals. The links'
weights are quantified using the following statistical methods:
cross-correlation, synchronization, mutual information, and coherence. Each of
these methods reflects a different aspect of the phase relations between the
waveforms of different stations in a given time window. We then developed
global measures to study the properties of the time-evolving network of seismic
activity. The global measures include the leading eigenvalues of the network
links, the number of links above a certain threshold, and k-means clustering.
We show that the network and its corresponding global measures vary
significantly during seismic events. The results are based on detailed waveform
station data and detailed catalogs from Southern California; our analysis
focused on 27 mainshocks, during which we examined one-day data prior to the
occurrence of the mainshock, as well as one hour of data following it. Among
all the measures we investigated, we found that the coherence measure using the
k-means clustering procedure exhibits the best performance. This technique
correctly identifies earthquake events with magnitudes larger than 2.5 and
exhibits moderate performance for weaker earthquakes with magnitudes larger
than 1.3.

lowest-resource clients, leading to sub-optimal performance and limited
practicality of personalized FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel approach named pFedGate for efficient personalized FL by adaptively and
efficiently learning sparse local models. With a lightweight trainable gating
layer, pFedGate enables clients to reach their full potential in model capacity
by generating different sparse models accounting for both the heterogeneous

temporal information in the video may be essential for general computer vision

anticommutation relations (CAR) is studied in the present work. The CAR algebra
is used to describe fermionic degrees of freedom in quantum mechanics and
quantum field theory. The states for which the relative entropy is investigated
are multi-excitation states (similar to multi-particle states) with respect to
KMS states defined with respect to a time-evolution induced by a unitary
dynamical group on the one-particle Hilbert space of the CAR algebra. If the
KMS state is quasifree, the relative entropy of multi-excitation states can be
explicitly calculated in terms of 2-point functions, which are defined entirely
by the one-particle Hilbert space defining the CAR algebra and the Hamilton
operator of the dynamical group on the one-particle Hilbert space. This applies
also in the case that the one-particle Hilbert space Hamilton operator has a
continuous spectrum so that the relative entropy of multi-excitation states
cannot be defined in terms of von Neumann entropies. The results obtained here
for the relative entropy of multi-excitation states on the CAR algebra can be
viewed as counterparts of results for the relative entropy of coherent states
on the algebra of canonical commutation relations (CCR) which have appeared
recently. It turns out to be useful to employ the setting of a self-dual CAR
algebra introduced by Araki.

training with smooth gradient norms at the early stage, but also encourages
better convergence in the subsequent training stage. Experiment results on
multiple translation tasks demonstrate that BranchNorm achieves a better
trade-off between training stability and converge performance.

general, allowing to define Emerson-Lei conditions on occurrences of letters.
We elaborate the construction of an Emerson-Lei game that captures the

symbolically by providing a fixpoint-based characterization of the winning
region, which is obtained from an analysis of the Zielonka tree of the winning

introduces a regularized learning framework incorporating class-aware

systems, networked sensing is a promising technique that can leverage the
cooperation among the base stations (BSs) to perform high-resolution
localization. However, a dense deployment of BSs to fully reap the networked
sensing gain is not a cost-efficient solution in practice. Motivated by the
advance in the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) technology for 6G
communication, this paper examines the feasibility of deploying the low-cost
IRSs to enhance the anchor density for networked sensing. Specifically, we
propose a novel heterogeneous networked sensing architecture, which consists of
both the active anchors, i.e., the BSs, and the passive anchors, i.e., the
IRSs. Under this framework, the BSs emit the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) communication signals in the downlink for localizing the
targets based on their echoes reflected via/not via the IRSs. However, there
are two challenges for using passive anchors in localization. First, it is
impossible to utilize the round-trip signal between a passive IRS and a passive
target for estimating their distance. Second, before localizing a target, we do
not know which IRS is closest to it and serves as its anchor. In this paper, we
show that the distance between a target and its associated IRS can be
indirectly estimated based on the length of the BS-target-BS path and the
BS-target-IRS-BS path. Moreover, we propose an efficient data association
method to match each target to its associated IRS. Numerical results are given
to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed heterogeneous
networked sensing architecture with both active and passive anchors.

modalities like video, text, and audio. However, we found that this task can be
easily affected by noisy information that does not contain useful semantics. To
this end, we present a novel paradigm that attempts to extract noise-resistant
features in its pipeline and introduces a noise-aware learning scheme to
effectively improve the robustness of multimodal emotion understanding. Our new
pipeline, namely Noise-Resistant Multimodal Transformer (NORM-TR), mainly
introduces a Noise-Resistant Generic Feature (NRGF) extractor and a Transformer
for the multimodal emotion recognition task. In particular, we make the NRGF
extractor learn a generic and disturbance-insensitive representation so that
consistent and meaningful semantics can be obtained. Furthermore, we apply a
Transformer to incorporate Multimodal Features (MFs) of multimodal inputs based
on their relations to the NRGF. Therefore, the possible insensitive but useful
information of NRGF could be complemented by MFs that contain more details. To
train the NORM-TR properly, our proposed noise-aware learning scheme
complements normal emotion recognition losses by enhancing the learning against
noises. Our learning scheme explicitly adds noises to either all the modalities
or a specific modality at random locations of a multimodal input sequence. We
correspondingly introduce two adversarial losses to encourage the NRGF
extractor to learn to extract the NRGFs invariant to the added noises, thus

Discrete Laplace (or Discrete Gaussian) distribution. We study the setting
where differential privacy of a counting query is achieved using bit-wise

  Binary error-correcting codes transmitted through noisy channels with
independent bit flips are well-studied in information theory. However, such
codes are unsuitable for differential privacy since they have (by design) high
sensitivity, i.e., neighboring integers have encodings with a large Hamming

sensitivity 1 encoding, but are also not suitable for differential privacy due
to lack of noise-robustness.
  Our main result is that it is possible, with a constant rate code, to
simultaneously achieve the sensitivity of Gray codes and the noise-robustness

disparities are defined as the mean difference in overall quality between
minorities and Whites not justified by underlying health conditions or patient

directly observed; the quality metrics are measured on different scales or, if
measured on the same scale, have different baseline rates; the structure of the

solution. However, the highly dynamic environment of urban areas, where AVs are
expected to operate, poses a challenge, as non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
communication can deteriorate the 5G mmWave positioning solution and lead to
erroneous corrections to the INS. To address this challenge, we exploit 5G
multipath and LoS signals to improve positioning performance in dense urban
environments. In addition, we integrate the proposed 5G-based positioning with
low-cost onboard motion sensors (OBMS). Moreover, the integration is realized
using an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) as an alternative to the widely utilized
EKF as a fusion engine to avoid ignoring the higher-order and non-linear terms
of the dynamic system model. We also introduce techniques to evaluate the
quality of each LoS and multipath measurement prior to incorporation into the
filter's correction stage. To validate the proposed methodologies, we performed
two test trajectories in the dense urban environment of downtown Toronto,
Canada. For each trajectory, quasi-real 5G measurements were collected using a
ray-tracing tool incorporating 3D map scans of real-world buildings, allowing
for realistic multipath scenarios. For the same trajectories, real OBMS data
were collected from two-different low-cost IMUs. Our integrated positioning

feedback process associated with locking the comb tooth to the reference laser
introduces complexity, bandwidth, and power requirements that, in the context

pure-helium atmospheres have Gaia magnitudes that are too close to the
pure-hydrogen case to explain this bifurcation. To reproduce the observed split
in the cooling sequence, it has been shown that trace amounts of hydrogen
and/or metals must be present in the helium-dominated atmospheres of
hydrogen-deficient white dwarfs. Yet, a complete explanation of the Gaia
bifurcation that takes into account known constraints on the spectral evolution
of white dwarfs has thus far not been proposed. In this work, we attempt to
provide such a holistic explanation by performing population synthesis
simulations coupled with state-of-the-art model atmospheres and evolutionary
calculations that account for element transport in the envelopes of white
dwarfs. By relying on empirically grounded assumptions, these simulations
successfully reproduce the bifurcation. We show that the convective dredge-up
of optically undetectable traces of carbon from the deep interior is crucial to
account for the observations. Neither the convective dilution/mixing of
residual hydrogen nor the accretion of hydrogen or metals can be the dominant
drivers of the bifurcation. Finally, we emphasize the importance of improving
theoretical models for the average ionization level of carbon in warm dense
helium, which governs the shape of the diffusive tail of carbon and in turn the
predicted amount of dredged-up carbon.

metallicity, [Fe/H]=-3.90, and that it is extremely C-poor, with A(C)=+3.60,
which corresponds to [C/Fe]=-0.33 (accounting for internal mixing). This adds
to the evidence of Sculptor being intrinsically C-poor at low [Fe/H]. However,
here we also report a new discovery of a carbon-enhanced metal-poor star in
Sculptor, DR20080, with no enhancement of Ba (CEMP-no), indicative of
enrichment by zero-metallicity low-energy supernovae. This is the first
evidence of a dual population of CEMP-no and C-normal stars in Sculptor at

$9^{+11}_{-8}\%$ at $\rm -4\leq[Fe/H]\leq-3$, compared to the significantly
higher fraction in the Milky Way halo, $\approx40\%$. In addition, we re-derive
chemical abundances of light, $\alpha$-, iron peak, and neutron-capture
elements in all Sculptor stars at $\rm [Fe/H]\leq-2.8$, with available
high-resolution spectra. Our results show that at these low [Fe/H], Sculptor is

  motion in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal","15 pages",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that anisotropic quantum corrections can dynamically give rise to
curved momentum-spacetimes for quasiparticles in metals. In the
(2+1)-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal, a curved
momentum-spacetime arises as the critical spin fluctuations generate red shift
that dilates frequency of electron unevenly on the Fermi surface. As the
disparity of the momentum-dependent red shift is controlled by the shape of the
Fermi surface, the momentum-spacetime geometry that emerges at low energies
depends on the bare nesting angle of the Fermi surface. With increasing nesting
angle, the region in which electron motion is slowed down by critical spin
fluctuations shrinks. On the other hand, the increasing nesting angle makes the
red shift stronger near the hot spots due to the weakened screening of the
interaction. These competing effects result in a non-monotonic dependence of
the cyclotron frequency of electron on the nesting angle of the Fermi surface.
The red shift that becomes more singular at the hot spots with increasing
nesting angle creates a possibility of realizing a momentum-space black hole
horizon beyond a critical nesting angle : the electron motion becomes
`perpetually' slowed down as it approaches a hot spot in the same way that the

hyperproperties of concurrent systems. They are finite automata with nodes
labeled with hypernode logic formulas and transitions labeled with actions. A
hypernode logic formula specifies relations between sequences of variable
values in different system executions. Unlike HyperLTL, hypernode logic takes
an asynchronous view on execution traces by constraining the values and the
order of value changes of each variable without correlating the timing of the
changes. Different execution traces are synchronized solely through the
transitions of hypernode automata. Hypernode automata naturally combine
asynchronicity at the node level with synchronicity at the transition level. We
show that the model-checking problem for hypernode automata is decidable over
action-labeled Kripke structures, whose actions induce transitions of the
specification automaton. For this reason, hypernode automaton is a suitable
formalism for specifying and verifying asynchronous hyperproperties, such as
declassifying observational determinism in multi-threaded programs.

some Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)-like models for arbitrary interaction strength
[1]. These models carry supersymmetric (SUSY) or SUSY-like structures. Namely,
bosons and Majorana fermions are both present and each of them interacts with
$(q-1)$ particles, but the model is not necessarily supersymmetric. It was
found that the chaos exponents in different models, no matter whether they
carry SUSY(-like) structures or not, all follow a universal single-parameter
scaling law for large $q$, and by tuning that parameter continuously a flow
from maximally chaotic to completely regular motion results. Here we report a
string-theoretical analog of this chaotic phenomenon. Specifically, we consider
closed string scattering near the two-sided AdS black hole, whose amplitude
grows exponentially in the Schwarzschild time, with a rate determined by the
Regge spin of the Pomeron exchanged during string scattering. We calculate the
Pomeron Regge spin for strings of different types, including the bosonic
string, the type II superstring and the heterotic superstring. We find that the
Pomeron Regge spin also displays a single-parameter scaling behavior
independent of string types, with the parameter depending on the string length
and the length scale characterizing the spacetime curvature; moreover, the
scaling function has the same limiting behaviors as that for the chaos exponent
of SYK-like models. Remarkably, the flow from maximally chaotic to completely
regular motion in SYK-like models corresponds to the flow of the Pomeron Regge
spin from $2$ to $1$.

either relaxing the calibration parameters in each probe in order to be set by
the data, or by only including priors with the condition that they are obtained
independently from the discrepant parameters. We also compiled and used a
dataset from previous direct measurements of $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$. We found when
combining, as our baseline, galaxy clusters counts + cluster baryon fraction
probe + cosmic chronometers + direct $\Omega_{\rm{M}}$ + priors from BBN and
CMB, that both parameters, $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$, are consistent with those
inferred with local probes, with $\sigma_8 = 0.745 \pm 0.05$ while $H_0 = 73.8
\pm 3.01$, and that for a value of $\Omega_{\rm{M}} = 0.22 \pm 0.01$ at more
than 3$\sigma$ from that usually determined by CMB. We also found similar
preferences when replacing cosmic chronometers (CC) by the Supernovae (SN) data
while allowing its calibration parameter to vary. However discrepancies
appeared when we combined SN in addition to CC suggesting either
inconsistencies between the SN sample and the other probes used or a serious
challenge to our hypothesis. We conclude that, either reconciling both tensions
requires local inferred values of matter density at odd with those obtained by
CMB, reviving by then an overlooked discrepancy, or simply that further
evidences are indicating that $\Lambda$CDM model is facing more difficulties to
accommodate simultaneously all the current available observations.(abridged)

a novel enabling technology -- \emph{Integrated Sensing and Communication

fundamentally important to understand how sensing and communication
functionalities interact (e.g., competitively or cooperatively) in terms of
resource utilization, while revealing insights and guidelines for the
development of effective physical-layer techniques. In this paper, we
characterize the fundamental performance tradeoff between the detection
probability for target monitoring and the user's achievable rate in ISAC
systems. To this end, we first discuss the achievable rate of the user under
sensing-free and sensing-interfered communication scenarios. Furthermore, we
derive closed-form expressions for the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the
successful probability of detection (PD) for monitoring the target of interest,
where we consider both communication-assisted and communication-interfered
sensing scenarios. In addition, the effects of the unknown channel coefficient
are also taken into account in our theoretical analysis. Based on our
analytical results, we then carry out a comprehensive assessment of the
performance tradeoff between sensing and communication functionalities.
Specifically, we formulate a power allocation problem to minimize the transmit
power at the base station (BS) under the constraints of ensuring a required PD
for perception as well as the communication user's quality of service
requirement in terms of achievable rate. Finally, simulation results
corroborate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of
the proposed power allocation solutions.

substituted into a full-data estimating equation, and the estimate is obtained
using standard software. The imputed completed data may be inspected and

The same imputed completed data can be used for several different estimands,

address time-varying covariates, such as a time by treatment interaction. We

implement sensitive operations on mass-market peripherals for which they have
little or no control. They are sometimes inclined to attempt this without using
hardware-assisted equipment, such as secure elements. In this case, the
white-box attack model is particularly relevant and includes access to every

traditional asymmetrical ciphers, which are treasured by private and public

  The McEliece cryptosystem is a code-based public key algorithm introduced in
1978 that is not subject to well-known quantum attacks and that could be
implemented in an uncontrolled environment. During the NIST post-quantum
cryptography standardization process, a derived candidate commonly refer to as
classic McEliece was selected. This algorithm is however vulnerable to some
fault injection attacks while a priori, this does not apply to the original
McEliece. In this article, we thus focus on the original McEliece cryptosystem

discuss on how to modify the original McEliece cryptosystem to make it
resilient to fault injection attacks.

Telescope Array System (VERITAS). VERITAS observations of the source were
triggered by the detection of a hard-spectrum GeV flare on May 15, 2015 with
the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT). A combined five-hour VERITAS exposure on
May 16th and May 18th resulted in a strong 13$\sigma$ detection with a
differential photon spectral index, $\Gamma$ = 3.8 $\pm$ 0.4, and a flux level
at 9% of the Crab Nebula above 120 GeV. This also triggered target of
opportunity observations with Swift, optical photometry, polarimetry and radio
measurements, also presented in this work, in addition to the VERITAS and
Fermi-LAT data. A temporal analysis of the gamma-ray flux during this period
finds evidence of a shortest variability timescale of $\tau_{obs}$ = 6.2 $\pm$
0.9 hours, indicating emission from compact regions within the jet, and the
combined gamma-ray spectrum shows no strong evidence of a spectral cut-off. An
investigation into correlations between the multiwavelength observations found
evidence of optical and gamma-ray correlations, suggesting a single-zone model
of emission. Finally, the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution is well
described by a simple one-zone leptonic synchrotron self-Compton radiation

degenerate with the growth index $\gamma$. Here we try to study the effect on
the cosmological parameters constraints from treating each independently by
considering $\sigma_8$ as a free and not derived parameter along with $\gamma$,
to then try to constrain all by three probes, namely the CMB spectrum, the
growth measurements from redshift space distortions $f\sigma_8$ and the galaxy
cluster counts. We also want to asses the impact of this relaxation on the
$\sigma_8$ tension. We also propose a more sophisticated correction, along with
the classical one that takes into account the impact of cosmology on the growth
measurements, which is to adjust the growth to keep the observed power spectrum
invariant with the background evolution. We found that untying the two
parameters does not shift the maximum likelihood on either $\sigma_8$ or
$\gamma$ but rather allow for larger bounds with respect to when $\sigma_8$ is
a derived parameter. More precisely, we obtain $\sigma_8 = 0.809\pm 0.043 $ and
$\gamma = 0.613\pm 0.046$ in agreement with Planck constraints for the former
and compatible with $\Lambda$CDM for the latter but with bounds enough wide to
accommodate both values subject of tensions for $\sigma_8$. On the other hand,
considering a tier correction yields $\sigma_8 = 0.734\pm 0.013$ close to the
local values albeit with a growth index $\gamma = 0.636\pm 0.022$ while
allowing a massive neutrinos yielded $\sigma_8 = 0.756\pm 0.024$, still
preferring low values but with looser constraints, with $\gamma = 0.549\pm
0.048$ and a slight preference for $\Sigma m_\nu \sim 0.19$ value. We conclude
that untying $\sigma_8$ and $\gamma$ helps in relieving the discomfort on the
former between CMB and local probes and that careful analyze should be followed
when using data obtained in a model dependent way.(abridged)

sampling-based training methods, HSGT effectively captures and aggregates
multi-level information on the hierarchical graph using only Transformer

arbitrary additional constraints on the chosen committee, and the utilities of
voters to belong to a very general class of set functions called $\beta$-self
bounding. When $\beta=1$, this class includes XOS (and hence, submodular and
additive) utilities. We define a novel generalization of core stability called
restrained core to handle constraints and consider multiplicative
approximations on the utility under this notion.
  Our main result is the following: If a smooth version of Nash Welfare is
globally optimized over committees within the constraints, the resulting
committee lies in the $e^{\beta}$-approximate restrained core for $\beta$-self
bounding utilities and arbitrary constraints. As a result, we obtain the first
constant approximation for stability with arbitrary additional constraints even
for additive utilities (factor of $e$), and the first analysis of the stability
of Nash Welfare with XOS functions even with no constraints.
  We complement this positive result by showing that the $c$-approximate
restrained core can be empty for $c<16/15$ even for approval utilities and one
additional constraint. Furthermore, the exponential dependence on $\beta$ in
the approximation is unavoidable for $\beta$-self bounding functions even with
no constraints.
  We next present improved and tight approximation results for simpler classes
of utility functions and simpler types of constraints. We also present an
extension of restrained core to extended justified representation with
constraints and show an existence result for matroid constraints. We finally
generalize our results to the setting with arbitrary-size candidates and no

precoding architectures have been regarded as energy-efficient solutions to
fulfill the vision of high-speed transmissions for 6G communications.
Benefiting from the advantages of providing a wide scan range and flat array
gain, the uniform circular array (UCA) has attracted much attention. However,
the growing bandwidth of mmWave and THz communications require
frequency-independent phase shifts, which can not be perfectly realized through
frequency-independent phase shifters (PSs) in classical hybrid precoding
architectures. This mismatch causes the beam defocus effect in UCA wideband
communications, where the high-gain beams could not form at non-central
frequencies. In this paper, we first investigate the characteristics of the
beam defocus effect distinguishing itself from the beam split effect in uniform
linear array (ULA) systems. The beam pattern of UCA in both frequency domain
and angular domain is analyzed, characterizing the beamforming loss caused by
the beam defocus effect. Then, the delay-phase-precoding (DPP) architecture
which leverages the true-time-delay (TTD) devices to generate
frequency-dependent phase shifts is employed to mitigate the beam defocus
effect. Finally, performance analysis and extensive simulation results are
provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the DPP architecture in UCA systems.

We explore the interplay between explicit and implicit models and losses, and
show that using implicit generative models (such as quantum circuit-based
models) with explicit losses (such as the KL divergence) leads to a new flavour
of barren plateau. In contrast, the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), which is a
popular example of an implicit loss, can be viewed as the expectation value of
an observable that is either low-bodied and trainable, or global and
untrainable depending on the choice of kernel. However, in parallel, we
highlight that the low-bodied losses required for trainability cannot in
general distinguish high-order correlations, leading to a fundamental tension
between exponential concentration and the emergence of spurious minima. We
further propose a new local quantum fidelity-type loss which, by leveraging
quantum circuits to estimate the quality of the encoded distribution, is both
faithful and enjoys trainability guarantees. Finally, we compare the

This performance degradation reduces the utility of coverage analysis in most

This paper presents SlipCover, a novel, near-zero overhead coverage analyzer
for Python. SlipCover works without modifications to either the Python
interpreter or PyPy. It first processes a program's AST to accurately identify
all branches and lines. SlipCover then dynamically rewrites Python bytecodes to
add lightweight instrumentation to each identified branch and line. At run

The result is extremely low overheads -- a median of just 5% -- making
SlipCover suitable for use in deployment. We show its efficiency can translate

information) is often understood as a correlation between ``region pairs"" and
is closely related to the concept of partial entanglement entropy (PEE). The
main theme of this paper is to try to understand the rigorous physical meaning
of such a region-pair correlation. This relies on the idea of holographic bit
threads and the recently developed thread-state correspondence. In a sense,
this effort also prompted us to give a definition of PEE based on the density
matrices of the holographic distilled states. Specifically, drawing from
experience with the locking multiflow configuration, we first provide a
bipartite entanglement explanation for the PEE=CMI scheme, but it leads to
difficulties in characterizing the entanglement entropy of disconnected
regions. We then introduce multipartite entanglement through the generalized
$n$-thread/perfect tensor state correspondence to solve this problem and
explain the coincidence between CMI and tripartite information in the
holographic quantum systems.

  Data Assimilation",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes two practical implementations of Four-Dimensional
Variational (4D-Var) Ensemble Kalman Filter (4D-EnKF) methods for non-linear
data assimilation. Our formulations' main idea is to avoid the intrinsic need
for adjoint models in the context of 4D-Var optimization and, even more, to
handle non-linear observation operators during the assimilation of
observations. The proposed methods work as follows: snapshots of an ensemble of
model realizations are taken at observation times, these snapshots are employed
to build control spaces onto which analysis increments can be estimated. Via
the linearization of observation operators at observation times, a line-search
based optimization method is proposed to estimate optimal analysis increments.
The convergence of this method is theoretically proven as long as the dimension
of control-spaces equals model one. In the first formulation, control spaces
are given by full-rank square root approximations of background error
covariance matrices via the Bickel and Levina precision matrix estimator. In
this context, we propose an iterative Woodbury matrix formula to perform the
optimization steps efficiently. The last formulation can be considered as an
extension of the Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter to the 4D-Var context. This
employs pseudo-square root approximations of prior error covariance matrices to
build control spaces. Experimental tests are performed by using the Lorenz 96
model. The results reveal that, in terms of Root-Mean-Square-Error values, both
methods can obtain reasonable estimates of posterior error modes in the 4D-Var
optimization problem. Moreover, the accuracies of the proposed filter
implementations can be improved as the ensemble sizes are increased.

real-world applications. However, recent studies highlight the vulnerability of
GNNs to malicious perturbations. Previous adversaries primarily focus on graph

but with notable limitations. Graph modification attack~(GMA) requires
manipulation of the original graph, which is often impractical, while graph
injection attack~(GIA) necessitates training a surrogate model in the black-box
setting, leading to significant performance degradation due to divergence
between the surrogate architecture and the actual victim model. Furthermore,
most methods concentrate on a single attack goal and lack a generalizable
adversary to develop distinct attack strategies for diverse goals, thus
limiting precise control over victim model behavior in real-world scenarios. To
address these issues, we present a gradient-free generalizable adversary that
injects a single malicious node to manipulate the classification result of a
target node in the black-box evasion setting. We propose Gradient-free
Generalizable Single Node Injection Attack, namely G$^2$-SNIA, a reinforcement

the victim model, G$^2$-SNIA learns patterns from exploration to achieve
diverse attack goals with extremely limited attack budgets. Through
comprehensive experiments over three acknowledged benchmark datasets and four
prominent GNNs in the most challenging and realistic scenario, we demonstrate
the superior performance of our proposed G$^2$-SNIA over the existing
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, by comparing G$^2$-SNIA with multiple

removal of residual $ZZ$ coupling and the implementation of driven swap or
swap-free controlled-$Z$ (c$Z$) gates. Our fully integrated coupler design is
only weakly flux tunable, cancels static linear coupling between the qubits,
avoids internal coupler dynamics or excitations, and operates with rf-pulses.
We show that residual $ZZ$ coupling can be reduced with a parametric dispersive
tone down to an experimental uncertainty of 5.5 kHz. Additionally, randomized
benchmarking reveals that the parametric swap c$Z$ gate achieves a fidelity of
99.4% in a gate duration of 60 ns, while the dispersive parametric swap-free

spectroscopy (FTS) benefiting from advantageous properties of optical frequency
combs. Unlike traditional FTS, DCS enables high-resolution measurements at high
speeds because it does not face the trade-off between resolution and update
rate inherent to mechanical scanning of the optical delay. However, high
complexity of the optical system and limited sensitivity of the measurements
remain major challenges for deploying broadband DCS in the short-wave infrared
(SWIR, 1.4-3 {\mu}m) and mid-infrared (mid-IR, >3 {\mu}m) regions where there
are strong ro-vibrational absorption bands of many molecules. We address these
challenges via a wavelength-tunable dual-comb optical parametric oscillator
(OPO) where both OPO pump beams are generated in a single laser cavity, while
both signal and idler beams are generated in a single OPO cavity. These linear
cavities are based on spatial multiplexing and operated in free-running mode.
The near-common-path of the beams in each cavity leads to low uncorrelated
noise, enabling comb-line-resolved measurements at a moderate optical comb line
spacing of 250 MHz. The source is operated at an instantaneous bandwidth below
1 THz, resulting in high power per comb line of up to 70 {\mu}W (signal) and
150 {\mu}W (idler). Combined with repetition rate differences of up to 20 kHz,
aliasing-free measurements are enabled. The accessible spectrum spans 1290 nm
to 1670 nm (signal) and 2700 nm to 5160 nm (idler). In a proof-of-principle

possible thanks to the removal of ego vehicle motion using its odometry. This
method is called Ego Motion Compensation (EMC). Thanks to the added points, EMC
significantly improves the performance of single-frame detectors. However, it
suffers from the shadow effect that manifests in dynamic objects' points
scattering along their trajectories. This effect results in a misalignment
between feature maps and objects' locations, thus limiting performance
improvement to stationary and slow-moving objects only. Scene flow allows
aligning point clouds in 3D space, thus naturally resolving the misalignment in
feature spaces. By observing that scene flow computation shares several
components with 3D object detection pipelines, we develop a plug-in module that
enables single-frame detectors to compute scene flow to rectify their Bird-Eye

is L-shaped, consisting of a horizontal sequence ($\sigma_{\rm out}/\sigma_{\rm

FQGs and QCCs are located at the top of vertical sequence, $\sigma_{\rm

entire bodies. PQGs reside along vertical sequence, so they have hot center but
cold outskirt. FSGs are diverse and can be found in both sequences. Galaxy

that star formation quenching and SMBH growth are effective only in dynamically
hot systems. A simple model along this line can reproduce the observed SMBH
scaling relations. We discuss how secular processes and strong interactions can
make a system dynamically hot, and lead to the SMBH growth and star formation

cosmic evolution. In this work we rather focus on one that could privilege
extensions to $\Lambda$CDM on intermediate redshifts by mean of a Gaussian-like
window function with a free moving centre $a_{Gwin}$ combined with a modified
gravity parameter $\mu_{Gwin}$ and an extension of the equation of state
parameter $\omega_{Gwin}$. Using different combinations of the latest available
current datasets subject of the discrepancies, such as the cosmic microwave
(CMB) background power spectrum, the baryonic acoustic scale (BAO) in galaxy
distribution, Weak lensing (WL) shear and galaxy clustering cross correlations
and local hubble constant measurements, we investigate whether such model could
alleviate each or both $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions. We found when combining
all probes that the $\sigma_8$ tension is alleviated while the $H_0$ is reduced
with a small preference for a positive $\omega_{Gwin}$ without a particular
preference for a redshift or a $\mu_{Gwin}$ different from its equivalent
$\Lambda$CDM value. However, if we follow another approach and compare the two
sets of the probes subject of discrepancy i.e. CMB+BAO vs WL+local $H_0$, we
found that the model is able of solving the $\sigma_8$ discrepancy at the
expense of a enlargement of the constraints, while the Hubble constant
discrepancy is not that affected due to the fact that the two likelihood
contours are stretched in parallel directions. We conclude that modifying
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology at intermediate redshifts within our model, and the
constraints from the datasets used in this study, are not likely a viable
solution to solve both tensions.

remained very active and has seen several impactful advancements in recent
years. This tutorial provides both an introduction to the core concepts of the
field and an overview of recent advancements in its foundations along with
several applications of its methods. The tutorial is divided into four parts:
Firstly, we give an overview of the different forms of bias that can be
addressed with ULTR methods. Secondly, we present a comprehensive discussion of
the latest estimation techniques in the ULTR field. Thirdly, we survey
published results of ULTR in real-world applications. Fourthly, we discuss the
connection between ULTR and fairness in ranking. We end by briefly reflecting
on the future of ULTR research and its applications. This tutorial is intended
to benefit both researchers and industry practitioners who are interested in
developing new ULTR solutions or utilizing them in real-world applications.

processing using either time differences or beamforming. The proposed approach
is based on the received power at each microphone, which enables simple
hardware, low sampling frequency and small arrays. The problem is recast into a
linear regression framework where the least squares method applies, and the
main drawback is that different sound sources are not readily separable.
  Our proposed approach is based on a training phase where the directional
sensitivity of each microphone element is estimated. This model is then used as
a fingerprint of the observed power vector in a real-time estimator. The
learned power vector is here modeled by a Fourier series expansion, which
enables Cram\'er-Rao lower bound computations. We demonstrate the performance
using a circular array with eight microphones with promising results.

condition of the one-photon resonance (where three driving fields are exactly
resonantly coupled to the three electric-dipole transitions, respectively) in
the CTLS and narrowband probe pulse assumption. Here, we extend the 2D

effective on enantiodetection with the help of experimental techniques, such as
the chop detection method, which is used to eliminate the influence of the
other redundant levels existing in the real system of chiral molecules. Under
these more general conditions, the enantiomeric excess of the chiral mixture is
estimated by taking an easily available standard sample (usually the racemic

phases represent a particularly compelling case for defect engineering of
nanomaterials due to the large variability in their physical properties as
different defects are introduced into their structure. However, effective
identification and quantification of defects remains a challenge even as
high-throughput scanning tunneling electron microscopy (STEM) methods improve.
This study highlights the benefits of employing first principles calculations
to produce digital twins for training deep learning segmentation models for
defect identification in monolayer MX2 phases. Around 600 defect structures
were obtained using density functional theory calculations, with each monolayer
MX2 structure being subjected to multislice simulations for the purpose of
generating the digital twins. Several deep learning segmentation architectures
were trained on this dataset, and their performances evaluated under a variety
of conditions such as recognizing defects in the presence of unidentified
impurities, beam damage, grain boundaries, and with reduced image quality from
low electron doses. This digital twin approach allows benchmarking different
deep learning architectures on a theory dataset, which enables the study of
defect classification under a broad array of finely controlled conditions. It
thus opens the door to resolving the underpinning physical reasons for model
shortcomings, and potentially chart paths forward for automated discovery of
materials defect phases in experiments.

with a probability of 0.993(6) for a single tweezer and 0.981(4) averaged over
the array. This is accomplished by near-perfect cyclicity of one of the nuclear
spin qubit states with an optically excited state under a magnetic field of
$B=58$ G, resulting in a bright/dark contrast of $\approx10^5$ during
fluorescence readout. The performance improves further as $\sim1/B^2$. The
state-averaged readout survival of 0.98(1) is limited by off-resonant
scattering to dark states and can be addressed via post-selection by measuring
the atom number at the end of the circuit, or during the circuit by performing
a measurement of both qubit states. We combine projective measurements with
high-fidelity rotations of the nuclear spin qubit via an AC magnetic field to
explore several paradigmatic scenarios, including the non-commutivity of
measurements in orthogonal bases, and the quantum Zeno mechanism in which
measurements ""freeze"" coherent evolution. Finally, we employ real-time
feedforward to repetitively deterministically prepare the qubit in the $+z$ or
$-z$ direction after initializing it in an orthogonal basis and performing a
projective measurement in the $z$-basis. These capabilities constitute an

However, such power outages have significant impacts on customers. This paper
proposes a novel framework for planning preemptive de-energization of power
systems to mitigate wildfire risk and damage. We model wildfire disruptions as
stochastic disruptions with random magnitude and timing and formulate a
two-stage stochastic program that maximizes the electricity delivered while
proactively reducing the risk of wildfires by selectively de-energizing

circuit is decomposed into blocks that span an identical number of qubits. In
the second stage permutation-aware synthesis (PAS), each block is optimized and
synthesized in isolation. In the third stage a permutation-aware mapping (PAM)
algorithm maps the blocks to the target device based on the information from
the second stage. Our approach is based on the following insights: (1)
partitioning the circuit into blocks is beneficial for qubit mapping and
routing; (2) with PAS, any block can implement an arbitrary input-output qubit
mapping that reduces the gate count; and (3) with PAM, for two adjacent blocks
we can select input-output permutations that optimize each block together with
the amount of communication required at the block boundary. Whereas existing
mapping algorithms preserve the original circuit structure and only introduce
""minimal"" communication via inserting SWAP or bridge gates, the PAS+PAM
approach can additionally change the circuit structure and take full advantage
of hardware-connectivity. Our experiments show that we can produce
better-quality circuits than existing mapping algorithms or commercial
compilers (Qiskit, TKET, BQSKit) with maximum optimization settings. For a
combination of benchmarks we produce circuits shorter by up to 68% (18% on
average) fewer gates than Qiskit, up to 36% (9% on average) fewer gates than
TKET, and up to 67% (21% on average) fewer gates than BQSKit. Furthermore, the
approach scales, and it can be seamlessly integrated into any quantum circuit
compiler or optimization infrastructure.

increased interest from the geophysical community. In these methods the
solution in each grid cell is approximated as a linear combination of basis
functions. Ensemble data assimilation (EnDA) aims to approximate the true state
by combining model outputs with observations using error statistics estimated
from an ensemble of model runs. Ensemble data assimilation in geophysical
models faces several well-documented issues. In this work we exploit the
expansion of the solution in DG basis functions to address some of these
issues. Specifically, it is investigated whether a DA-DG combination 1)
mitigates the need for observation thinning, 2) reduces errors in the field's
gradients, 3) can be used to set up scale-dependent localisation. Numerical
experiments are carried out using stochastically generated ensembles of model
states, with different noise properties, and with Legendre polynomials as basis
functions. It is found that strong reduction in the analysis error is achieved
by using DA-DG and that the benefit increases with increasing DG order. This is
especially the case when small scales dominate the background error. The DA
improvement in the 1st derivative is on the other hand marginal. We think this
to be a counter-effect of the power of DG to fit the observations closely,
which can deteriorate the estimates of the derivatives. Applying optimal
localisation to the different polynomial orders, thus exploiting their
different spatial length, is beneficial: it results in a covariance matrix
closer to the true covariance than the matrix obtained using traditional
optimal localisation in state-space.

where an action's loss is a function of the number of times that action was
recently played in the prior $m$ timesteps, where $m$ corresponds to a bound on
human memory capacity. To more faithfully capture decay of human memory with
time, we introduce the Weighted Tallying Bandit (WTB), which generalizes this
setting by requiring that an action's loss is a function of a \emph{weighted}
summation of the number of times that arm was played in the last $m$ timesteps.
This WTB setting is intractable without further assumption. So we study it
under Repeated Exposure Optimality (REO), a condition motivated by the
literature on human physiology, which requires the existence of an action that
when repetitively played will eventually yield smaller loss than any other
sequence of actions. We study the minimization of the complete policy regret
(CPR), which is the strongest notion of regret, in WTB under REO. Since $m$ is
typically unknown, we assume we only have access to an upper bound $M$ on $m$.
We show that for problems with $K$ actions and horizon $T$, a simple
modification of the successive elimination algorithm has $O \left( \sqrt{KT} +
(m+M)K \right)$ CPR. Interestingly, upto an additive (in lieu of
mutliplicative) factor in $(m+M)K$, this recovers the classical guarantee for
the simpler stochastic multi-armed bandit with traditional regret. We
additionally show that in our setting, any algorithm will suffer additive CPR
of $\Omega \left( mK + M \right)$, demonstrating our result is nearly optimal.

significant fraction of the disk becoming retrograde at large radii. If initial
orbits are highly eccentric, an in-plane kick forms a bar-like structure made
up of two anti-aligned lopsided disks. An out-of-plane kick causes clustering

the Bernoulli free boundary problem, a well-known ill-posed problem that seeks
the unknown free boundary through Cauchy data. Different formulations have been
proposed in the literature that differ in the choice of the objective
functional. Specifically, it was shown respectively in [14] and [16] that
tracking Neumann data is well-posed but tracking Dirichlet data is not. In this
paper we propose a new well-posed objective functional that tracks Dirichlet
data at the free boundary. By calculating the Euler derivative and the shape
Hessian of the objective functional we show that the new formulation is
well-posed, i.e., the shape Hessian is coercive at the minimizers. The
coercivity of the shape Hessian may ensure the existence of optimal solutions
for the nonlinear Ritz-Galerkin approximation method and its convergence, thus
is crucial for the formulation. As a summary, we conclude that tracking
Dirichlet or Neumann data in its energy norm is not sufficient, but tracking it
in a half an order higher norm will be well-posed. To support our theoretical
results we carry out extensive numerical experiments.

vertex $u$ hears $f$ from $v\in V_f^+$ if $d_G(u, v)\leq f(v)$. The broadcast
$f$ is hearing independent if no broadcasting vertex hears another. If, in
addition, any vertex $u$ that hears $f$ from multiple broadcasting vertices
satisfies $f(v)\leq d_G(u, v)$ for all $v\in V_f^+$, the broadcast is said to

  The cost of $f$ is $\sigma(f)=\sum_{v\in V(G)}f(v)$. The minimum cost of a
maximal boundary independent broadcast on G, called the lower bn-independence

For both parameters, we show that the lower bn-independence number

  We further study the maximum cost of boundary independent broadcasts, denoted

broadcast problem is NP-hard by a reduction from the independent set problem to
an instance of the maximum bn-independent broadcast problem.
  With particular interest in caterpillars, we investigate bounds on
$\alpha_{bn}(T)$ when T is a tree in terms of its order and the number of

  Recommender Systems",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents an innovative approach to address the problems
researchers face in Emotion Aware Recommender Systems (EARS): the difficulty
and cumbersome collecting voluminously good quality emotion-tagged datasets and
an effective way to protect users' emotional data privacy. Without enough
good-quality emotion-tagged datasets, researchers cannot conduct repeatable
affective computing research in EARS that generates personalized
recommendations based on users' emotional preferences. Similarly, if we fail to
fully protect users' emotional data privacy, users could resist engaging with
EARS services. This paper introduced a method that detects affective features
in subjective passages using the Generative Pre-trained Transformer Technology,
forming the basis of the Affective Index and Affective Index Indicator (AII).
Eliminate the need for users to build an affective feature detection mechanism.
The paper advocates for a separation of responsibility approach where users
protect their emotional profile data while EARS service providers refrain from
retaining or storing it. Service providers can update users' Affective Indices
in memory without saving their privacy data, providing Affective Aware
recommendations without compromising user privacy. This paper offers a solution
to the subjectivity and variability of emotions, data privacy concerns, and
evaluation metrics and benchmarks, paving the way for future EARS research.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Conversational recommender system (CRS) interacts with users through
multi-turn dialogues in natural language, which aims to provide high-quality
recommendations for user's instant information need. Although great efforts
have been made to develop effective CRS, most of them still focus on the
contextual information from the current dialogue, usually suffering from the
data scarcity issue. Therefore, we consider leveraging historical dialogue data
to enrich the limited contexts of the current dialogue session.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained hypergraph interest modeling
approach to capture user interest beneath intricate historical data from
different perspectives. As the core idea, we employ hypergraph to represent
complicated semantic relations underlying historical dialogues. In our
approach, we first employ the hypergraph structure to model users' historical
dialogue sessions and form a session-based hypergraph, which captures
coarse-grained, session-level relations. Second, to alleviate the issue of data
scarcity, we use an external knowledge graph and construct a knowledge-based
hypergraph considering fine-grained, entity-level semantics. We further conduct
multi-grained hypergraph convolution on the two kinds of hypergraphs, and
utilize the enhanced representations to develop interest-aware CRS. Extensive
experiments on two benchmarks ReDial and TG-ReDial validate the effectiveness
of our approach on both recommendation and conversation tasks. Code is

systems (SRS) is shown to be suited by reinforcement learning (RL) which finds
a policy to maximize long-term rewards. Meanwhile, RL has its shortcomings,
particularly requiring a large number of online samples for exploration, which
is risky in real-world applications. One of the appealing ways to avoid the
risk is to build a simulator and learn the optimal recommendation policy in the
simulator. In LTE optimization, the simulator is to simulate multiple users'
daily feedback for given recommendations. However, building a user simulator
with no reality-gap, i.e., can predict user's feedback exactly, is unrealistic
because the users' reaction patterns are complex and historical logs for each
user are limited, which might mislead the simulator-based recommendation
policy. In this paper, we present a practical simulator-based recommender
policy training approach, Simulation-to-Recommendation (Sim2Rec) to handle the
reality-gap problem for LTE optimization. Specifically, Sim2Rec introduces a
simulator set to generate various possibilities of user behavior patterns, then
trains an environment-parameter extractor to recognize users' behavior patterns
in the simulators. Finally, a context-aware policy is trained to make the
optimal decisions on all of the variants of the users based on the inferred
environment-parameters. The policy is transferable to unseen environments
(e.g., the real world) directly as it has learned to recognize all various user
behavior patterns and to make the correct decisions based on the inferred
environment-parameters. Experiments are conducted in synthetic environments and
a real-world large-scale ride-hailing platform, DidiChuxing. The results show
that Sim2Rec achieves significant performance improvement, and produces robust
recommendations in unseen environments.

counterparty's failure, is central for the financial stability. Credit risk
models focus on the financial conditions of borrowers and only marginally
consider other risks from the real economy, supply chains in particular. Recent
pandemics, geopolitical instabilities, and natural disasters demonstrated that
supply chain shocks do contribute to large financial losses. Based on a unique
nation-wide micro-dataset, containing practically all supply chain relations of
all Hungarian firms, together with their bank loans, we estimate how
firm-failures affect the supply chain network, leading to potentially
additional firm defaults and additional financial losses. Within a multi-layer
network framework we define a financial systemic risk index (FSRI) for every
firm, quantifying these expected financial losses caused by its own- and all
the secondary defaulting loans caused by supply chain network (SCN) shock
propagation. We find a small fraction of firms carrying substantial financial
systemic risk, affecting up to 16% of the banking system's overall equity.
These losses are predominantly caused by SCN contagion. For every bank we
calculate the expected loss (EL), value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall
(ES), with and without accounting for SCN contagion. We find that SCN contagion
amplifies the EL, VaR, and ES by a factor of 4.3, 4.5, and 3.2, respectively.
These findings indicate that for a more complete picture of financial stability
and realistic credit risk assessment, SCN contagion needs to be considered.
This newly quantified contagion channel is of potential relevance for
regulators' future systemic risk assessments.

We tested our GM workflow on two model systems, CDK2 and KRAS. In both cases,
our model generated chemically viable molecules with a high predicted affinity

"2305.11875","Bo Wu","Tao Xu, Bo Wu, Ruilong Fan, Yun Zhou and Di Huang","FR-Net:A Light-weight FFT Residual Net For Gaze Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaze estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, however, existing
methods suffer from high computational costs, which limit their practical
deployment in resource-limited environments. In this paper, we propose a novel
lightweight model, FR-Net, for accurate gaze angle estimation while
significantly reducing computational complexity. FR-Net utilizes the Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract gaze-relevant features in frequency domains
while reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we introduce a shortcut
component that focuses on the spatial domain to further improve the accuracy of
our model. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
substantially lower gaze error angles (3.86 on MPII and 4.51 on EYEDIAP)
compared to state-of-the-art gaze estimation methods, while utilizing 17 times
fewer parameters (0.67M) and only 12\% of FLOPs (0.22B). Furthermore, our
method outperforms existing lightweight methods in terms of accuracy and
efficiency for the gaze estimation task. These results suggest that our
proposed approach has significant potential applications in areas such as
human-computer interaction and driver assistance systems.

"2306.01740","John Cartlidge","Lawrence Clegg and John Cartlidge","Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in
  online sportsbooks","26 pages, 2 figures. This paper is a replication study. Problems in
  the original study are discovered and corrected. Replication code and data
  are available online: https://github.com/Faxulous/notFeelingTheBuzz",,,,"stat.AP cs.CE q-fin.GN q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a strict replication and correction of results published in a
recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz:
Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of
Forecasting, 2022, doi:10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS introduced a
novel ""buzz factor"" metric for tennis players, calculated as the log difference
between the number of Wikipedia profile page views a player receives the day
before a tennis match and the player's median number of daily profile views.
The authors claim that their buzz factor metric is able to predict mispricing
by bookmakers and they demonstrate that it can be used to form a profitable
strategy for betting on tennis match outcomes. Here, we use the same dataset as
RRS to reproduce their results exactly. However, we discover that the published
results are significantly affected by a single bet (the ""Hercog"" bet) that
returns substantial outlier profits; and these profits are generated by taking
advantage of erroneously long odds in the out-of-sample test data. Once this
data quality issue is addressed, we show that the strategy of RRS is no longer
profitable in ""practical"" scenarios. Using an extended and cleaned dataset, we
then perform further exploration of the models and show that the ""impractical""
betting strategy that uses best odds in the market remains profitable (in
theory). However, evidence suggests that the vast majority of returns are
generated by exploiting individual bookmaker's mispricing of odds relative to
the market, and the novel buzz factor metric has negligible contribution to
profits. We make all code and data available online.

this work, we follow the existing work on collaborative MARL where agents in a
connected time varying network can exchange information among each other in
order to reach a consensus. We introduce vulnerabilities in the consensus
updates of existing MARL algorithms where agents can deviate from their usual
consensus update, who we term as adversarial agents. We then proceed to provide
an algorithm that allows non-adversarial agents to reach a consensus in the

weeks, garnering significant public attention. This has sparked concerns about
aligning these models with human values, their impact on labor markets, and the
potential need for regulation in further research and development. However, the
discourse often lacks a focus on the imperative to widely diffuse the societal
benefits of LLMs. To qualify this societal benefit, we assert that LLMs exhibit
emergent abilities to humanize technology more effectively than previous
technologies, and for people across language, occupation, and accessibility
divides. We argue that they do so by addressing three mechanizing bottlenecks
in today's computing technologies: creating diverse and accessible content,
learning complex digital tools, and personalizing machine learning algorithms.
We adopt a case-based approach and illustrate each bottleneck with two examples
where current technology imposes bottlenecks that LLMs demonstrate the ability
to address. Given this opportunity to humanize technology widely, we advocate
for more widespread understanding of LLMs, tools and methods to simplify use of
LLMs, and cross-cutting institutional capacity.

of a single type of implicit user feedback, such as clicks, to enhance the
prediction of sparse target behavior such as purchases. Using multiple types of
implicit user feedback for such target behavior prediction purposes is still an
open question. Existing studies that attempted to learn from multiple types of
user behavior often fail to: (i) learn universal and accurate user preferences
from different behavioral data distributions, and (ii) overcome the noise and
bias in observed implicit user feedback. To address the above problems, we
propose multi-behavior alignment (MBA), a novel recommendation framework that
learns from implicit feedback by using multiple types of behavioral data. We
conjecture that multiple types of behavior from the same user (e.g., clicks and
purchases) should reflect similar preferences of that user. To this end, we
regard the underlying universal user preferences as a latent variable. The
variable is inferred by maximizing the likelihood of multiple observed
behavioral data distributions and, at the same time, minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) between user models learned from
auxiliary behavior (such as clicks or views) and the target behavior
separately. MBA infers universal user preferences from multi-behavior data and
performs data denoising to enable effective knowledge transfer. We conduct
experiments on three datasets, including a dataset collected from an
operational e-commerce platform. Empirical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method in utilizing multiple types of behavioral
data to enhance the prediction of the target behavior.

controller architecture for a class of linear Markovian jump systems (MJS)
where the aforementioned ``patterns'' correspond to finite-length sequences of
modes. In our analysis of recurrent patterns, we use martingale theory to
derive closed-form solutions to quantities pertaining to the occurrence of
patterns: 1) the expected minimum occurrence time of any pattern from some
predefined collection, 2) the probability of a pattern being the first to occur
among the collection. Our method is applicable to real-world dynamics because
we make two extensions to common assumptions in prior pattern-occurrence
literature. First, the distribution of the mode process is unknown, and second,
the true realization of the mode process is not observable. As demonstration,
we consider fault-tolerant control of a dynamic topology-switching network, and
empirically compare PLP to two controllers without PLP: a baseline based on the
novel System Level Synthesis (SLS) approach and a topology-robust extension of
the SLS baseline. We show that PLP is able to reject disturbances as
effectively as the topology-robust controller at reduced computation time and
control effort. We discuss several important tradeoffs, such as the size of the
pattern collection and the system scale versus the accuracy of the mode
predictions, which show how different PLP implementations affect stabilization
and runtime performance.

through StrAE leads to improved embeddings over prior work, and that our novel
contrastive objective over structure outperforms the standard cross-entropy
objective. Moreover, in contrast to findings from prior work that weakly
leverages structure, we find that being completely faithful to structure does
enable disambiguation between types of structure based on the corresponding
model's performance. As further evidence of StrAE's utility, we develop a
simple proof-of-concept approach to simultaneously induce structure while
learning embeddings, rather than being given structure, and find that
performance is comparable to that of the best-performing models where structure
is given. Finally, we contextualise these results by comparing StrAE against

to 18 K in thin films and its absence in bulk materials. Another unexplained
mystery of nickelates is their temperature-dependent upper critical field,
$B_{c2}(T)$, which can be nicely fitted to two-dimensional (2D) models; however
the deduced film thickness, $d_{sc,GL}$, exceeds the physical film thickness,
$d_{sc}$, by a manifold. To address the latter, it should be noted that 2D
models assume that $d_{sc}$ is less than the in-plane, $\xi_{ab}(0)$, and
out-of-plane, $\xi_{c}(0)$, ground state coherence lengths, respectively, and,
in addition, that the inequality $\xi_{c}(0) < \xi_{ab}(0)$ satisfies. Analysis

localization of anatomical area of interests that are semantically meaningful.
In this work, we propose an ROI image retrieval image network that retrieves
images with similar anatomy by extracting anatomical features (via bounding
boxes) and evaluate similarity between pairwise anatomy-categorized features
between the query and the database of images using contrastive learning. ROI
queries are encoded using a contrastive-pretrained encoder that was fine-tuned
for anatomy classification, which generates an anatomical-specific latent space
for region-correlated image retrieval. During retrieval, we compare the
anatomically encoded query to find similar features within a feature database
generated from training samples, and retrieve images with similar regions from
training samples. We evaluate our approach on both anatomy classification and
image retrieval tasks using the Chest ImaGenome Dataset. Our proposed strategy
yields an improvement over state-of-the-art pretraining and co-training
strategies, from 92.24 to 94.12 (2.03%) classification accuracy in anatomies.

and improve the performance of local few-shot character recognition, it is
often necessary for one organization to collect a large amount of data from
similar organizations. However, due to the natural presence of private
information in text data, different organizations are unwilling to share
private data, such as addresses and phone numbers. Therefore, it becomes
increasingly important to design a privacy-preserving collaborative training
framework for the Chinese text recognition task. In this paper, we introduce
personalized federated learning (pFL) into the Chinese text recognition task
and propose the pFedCR algorithm, which significantly improves the model
performance of each client (organization) without sharing private data.
Specifically, based on CRNN, to handle the non-iid problem of client data, we
add several attention layers to the model and design a two-stage training
approach for the client. In addition, we fine-tune the output layer of the
model using a virtual dataset on the server, mitigating the problem of
character imbalance in Chinese documents. The proposed approach is validated on
public benchmarks and two self-built real-world industrial scenario datasets.
The experimental results show that the pFedCR algorithm can improve the
performance of local personalized models while also improving their
generalization performance on other client data domains. Compared to local
training within an organization, pFedCR improves model performance by about
20%. Compared to other state-of-the-art personalized federated learning
methods, pFedCR improves performance by 6%~8%. Moreover, through federated

various applications, including assisting with clinical decision-making as
demonstrated by strong performance of large language models on medical

which may be representative of clinical practice, remains unexplored. Methods:
In this study, the accuracy of large language AI models GPT4 and GPT3.5 in
diagnosing complex clinical cases was investigated using published Case Records
of the Massachusetts General Hospital. A total of 50 cases requiring a
diagnosis and diagnostic test published from January 1, 2022 to April 16, 2022
were identified. For each case, models were given a prompt requesting the top
three specific diagnoses and associated diagnostic tests, followed by case
text, labs, and figure legends. Model outputs were assessed in comparison to
the final clinical diagnosis and whether the model-predicted test would result
in a correct diagnosis. Results: GPT4 and GPT3.5 accurately provided the
correct diagnosis in 26% and 22% of cases in one attempt, and 46% and 42%
within three attempts, respectively. GPT4 and GPT3.5 provided a correct
essential diagnostic test in 28% and 24% of cases in one attempt, and 44% and
50% within three attempts, respectively. No significant differences were found
between the two models, and multiple trials with identical prompts using the

demonstrate potential usefulness in generating differential diagnoses but
remain limited in their ability to provide a single unifying diagnosis in
complex, open-ended cases. Future research should focus on evaluating model
performance in larger datasets of open-ended clinical challenges and exploring
potential human-AI collaboration strategies to enhance clinical

quantifying anatomical variations within populations of anatomies. However,
traditional correspondence-based SSM generation methods require a
time-consuming re-optimization process each time a new subject is added to the
cohort, making the inference process prohibitive for clinical research.
Additionally, they require complete geometric proxies (e.g., high-resolution
binary volumes or surface meshes) as input shapes to construct the SSM.
Unordered 3D point cloud representations of shapes are more easily acquired
from various medical imaging practices (e.g., thresholded images and surface
scanning). Point cloud deep networks have recently achieved remarkable success
in learning permutation-invariant features for different point cloud tasks
(e.g., completion, semantic segmentation, classification). However, their

networks can provide an untapped potential for SSM, capturing population-level
statistical representations of shapes while reducing the inference burden and
relaxing the input requirement. We discuss the limitations of these techniques

challenging task. In particular, the absence of a heterogeneous twin nucleation
model which provides accurate energetic descriptions for twin-related
structures belies a need to more deeply understand twin energetics. To address
this problem, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to follow the
energetic evolution of $\{10\overline{1}2\}$ tension twin embryos nucleating
from an asymmetrically-tilted grain boundary. The line, surface and volumetric
terms associated with twin nucleation are identified. A micromechanical model
is proposed where the stress field around the twin nucleus is estimated using
the Eshelby formalism, and the contributions of the various twin-related
structures to the total energy of the twin are evaluated. The reduction in the
grain boundary energy arising from the change in character of the prior grain
boundary is found to be able to offset the energy costs of the other
interfaces. The defect structures bounding the stacking faults that form inside
the twin are also found to possibly have significant energetic contributions.
These results suggest that both of these effects could be critical
considerations when predicting twin nucleation sites in magnesium.

clusters with credence to the kinematics of their emissions. Besides the
fitting of the preformation formula to reproduce the experimental half-lives,
we have investigated the interrelationship between the parameters involved in
the cluster decay process for medium, heavy and superheavy nuclei. Based on the
established conceptual findings, we propose a new cluster preformation
probability ($P_0$) formula that incorporates all influential parameters of the
cluster radioactivity and thus has an edge over the existing formulae in the
literature. Further, we hypothesize that a fraction of the decay energy is
needed for cluster formation within the parent nucleus. The proposed formula
opens a new paradigm to separately estimate the energy contributed during the
cluster formation from its emission and thus shows that the contribution of the
Q-value splits into three major parts accounting for the energy contributed
during the cluster preformation, its emission and recoil of the daughter
nucleus. Moreover, the expression $P_0$ is adept at accommodating the theorized
concept of heavy particle radioactivity (HPR). The result reveals that, like
$\alpha$-decay, a proper estimation of the $P_0$ and $Q$-value in the cluster
studies are enriched with qualitative information about the nuclear structure.
However, from the analysis, the Geiger-Nuttall law is not the best compromise
in the clustering due to the non-linearity between $\log_{10}T_{1/2}$ and
$\sqrt{Q}$, unlike in $\alpha$-decay. We have demonstrated that with the
inclusion of the proposed formula, the half-life predictions from both
microscopic R3Y and phenomenological M3Y NN potentials closely agree with the
available experimental data and that the slight variation can be traced to
their peculiar barrier characteristics.

circumstances, e.g. quantum optomechanics or interferometric gravitational wave
detection, the temperature of the resonator may not be uniform, resulting in
the resonator being thermally linked to a spatially varying thermal bath. In
this case, the link of a mode of interest to its thermal environment is less
straightforward to understand. Here, we engineer a distributed bath on a
germane optomechanical platform -- a phononic crystal -- and utilize both
highly localized and extended resonator modes to probe the spatially varying
bath in entirely different bath regimes. As a result, we observe striking
differences in the modes' Brownian motion magnitude. From these measurements we
are able to reconstruct the local temperature map across our resonator and
measure nanoscale effects on thermal conductivity and radiative cooling. Our
work explains some thermal phenomena encountered in optomechanical experiments,
e.g. mode-dependent heating due to light absorption. Moreover, our work
generalizes the typical figure of merit quantifying the coupling of a resonator
mode to its thermal environment from the mechanical dissipation to the overlap

analysis relies on accelerogram amplitude scaling for structural

investigates seismological characteristics of scaled accelerograms so as to
inform future ground motion selection and seismic risk assessment methods. If a
recorded accelerogram is scaled linearly by multiplying it with a positive
factor, it is shown using the Representation theorem and the accelerogram
Fourier spectrum that moment magnitude scales logarithmically and static stress
drop scales linearly. Other seismic parameters such as the Joyner-Boore
distance metric and the effective rupture area are invariant to scaling an
accelerogram. This proposed interpretation of scaling is validated in the time

relevant to disease, but they often rely on schemas that are not centred around
a node or entity of interest, such as a person. Entity-centric KGs are
relatively unexplored but hold promise in representing important facets
connected to a central node and unlocking downstream tasks beyond graph

inferential challenges, such as multimodal or flat likelihood surfaces, in this

inferential problems by linking them to the concepts of near-redundancy and
practical non-identifiability of parameters. We show that the maximum
likelihood estimators of the parameters in this class of models are consistent
and asymptotically normal. Thus, the inferential problems in this class of
models are related to the finite-sample scenario, where it is difficult to
distinguish between the fitted model and a nested non-identifiable (i.e.,
parameter-redundant) model. We propose a method for detecting near-redundancy,
based on distances between probability distributions. We also employ methods
used in other areas for detecting practical non-identifiability and
near-redundancy, including the inspection of the profile likelihood function
and the Hessian method. For cases where inferential problems are detected, we
discuss alternatives such as using model selection tools to identify simpler
models that do not exhibit these inferential problems, increasing the sample
size, or extending the follow-up time. We illustrate the performance of the
proposed methods through a simulation study. Our simulation study reveals a
link between the presence of near-redundancy and practical non-identifiability.

and Barron spaces, which are natural function spaces that arise in the
high-dimensional analysis of random feature models (RFMs) and two-layer neural
networks. Through a duality analysis, we reveal that the approximation and
estimation of these spaces can be considered equivalent in a certain sense.
This enables us to focus on the easier problem of approximation and estimation
when studying the generalization of both models. The dual equivalence is
established by defining an information-based complexity that can effectively
control estimation errors. Additionally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our
duality framework through comprehensive analyses of two concrete applications.
  The first application is to study learning functions in $\mathcal{F}_{p,\pi}$
with RFMs. We prove that the learning does not suffer from the curse of
dimensionality as long as $p>1$, implying RFMs can work beyond the kernel
regime. Our analysis extends existing results [CMM21] to the noisy case and
removes the requirement of overparameterization.
  The second application is to investigate the learnability of reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) under the $L^\infty$ metric. We derive both lower
and upper bounds of the minimax estimation error by using the spectrum of the
associated kernel. We then apply these bounds to dot-product kernels and
analyze how they scale with the input dimension. Our results suggest that

index $\alpha$. The system represents linearly-coupled optical waveguides with
the fractional paraxial diffraction or group-velocity dispersion (the latter
system was used in a recent experiment, which demonstrated the first
observation of the wave propagation in an effectively fractional setup). By
dint of numerical computations and variational approximation (VA), we identify
the SSB in the fractional coupler as the bifurcation of the subcritical type
(i.e., the symmetry-breaking phase transition of the first kind), whose
subcriticality becomes stronger with the increase of fractionality $2 -
\alpha$, in comparison with very weak subcriticality in the case of the
non-fractional diffraction, $\alpha = 2$. In the Cauchy limit of $\alpha = 1$,
it carries over into the extreme subcritical bifurcation, manifesting
backward-going branches of asymmetric solitons which never turn forward. The
analysis of the SSB bifurcation is extended for moving (tilted) solitons, which
is a nontrivial problem because the fractional diffraction does not admit

demonstrated an impressive ability to generalize to new tasks, the training
phases heavily rely on large amounts of diverse and high-quality instruction
data (such as ChatGPT and GPT-4). Unfortunately, acquiring high-quality data,
especially when it comes to human-written data, can pose significant challenges
both in terms of cost and accessibility. Moreover, concerns related to privacy
can further limit access to such data, making the process of obtaining it a
complex and nuanced undertaking. Consequently, this hinders the generality of
the tuned models and may restrict their effectiveness in certain contexts. To
tackle this issue, our study introduces a new approach called Federated
Instruction Tuning (FedIT), which leverages federated learning (FL) as the
learning framework for the instruction tuning of LLMs. This marks the first
exploration of FL-based instruction tuning for LLMs. This is especially
important since text data is predominantly generated by end users. Therefore,
it is imperative to design and adapt FL approaches to effectively leverage
these users' diverse instructions stored on local devices, while preserving
privacy and ensuring data security. In the current paper, by conducting widely
used GPT-4 auto-evaluation, we demonstrate that by exploiting the heterogeneous
and diverse sets of instructions on the client's end with the proposed
framework FedIT, we improved the performance of LLMs compared to centralized
training with only limited local instructions. Further, in this paper, we
developed a Github repository named Shepherd. This repository offers a
foundational framework for exploring federated fine-tuning of LLMs using
heterogeneous instructions across diverse categories.

must be integrated into a collective response. A striking example is the
thermal imaging organ of pit vipers. Single nerve fibers in the organ reliably
respond to mK temperature increases, a thousand times more sensitive than their
molecular sensors, thermo-TRP ion channels. Here, we propose a mechanism for
the integration of this molecular information. In our model, amplification
arises due to proximity to a dynamical bifurcation, separating a regime with
frequent and regular action potentials (APs), from a regime where APs are
irregular and infrequent. Near the transition, AP frequency can have an
extremely sharp dependence on temperature, naturally accounting for the
thousand-fold amplification. Furthermore, close to the bifurcation, most of the
information about temperature available in the TRP channels' kinetics can be
read out from the timing of APs even in the presence of readout noise. While
proximity to such bifurcation points typically requires fine-tuning of
parameters, we propose that having feedback act from the order parameter (AP
frequency) onto the control parameter robustly maintains the system in the
vicinity of the bifurcation. This robustness suggests that similar feedback
mechanisms might be found in other sensory systems which also need to detect
tiny signals in a varying environment.

Specifically, the exponential SFH leads to the shallowest attenuation curves.
Using simulated data, we also find the exponential SFH fails to outperform the

strong dynamic interactions create barriers to designing a successful
distributed coordinated controller to achieve synergy between all the units and
unlock the potential for grid response. To address these challenges, we
introduce a directed graph representation of IESs using an augmented Jacobian
matrix to depict their underlying dynamics topology. By utilizing this
representation, a generic subsystem decomposition method is proposed to
partition the entire IES vertically based on the dynamic time scale and
horizontally based on the closeness of interconnections between the operating
units. Exploiting the decomposed subsystems, we develop a cooperative
distributed economic model predictive control (DEMPC) with multiple global
objectives that regulate the generated power at the grid's requests and satisfy
the customers cooling and system economic requirements. In the DEMPC, multiple
local decision-making agents cooperate sequentially and iteratively to leverage
the potential across all the units for system-wide dynamic synergy.
Furthermore, we discuss how subsystem decomposition impacts the design of
distributed cooperation schemes for IESs and provide a control-oriented basic
guideline on the optimal decomposition of complex energy systems. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that the control strategies with different levels of
decomposition and collaboration will lead to marked differences in the overall
performance of IES. The standard control scheme based on the proposed subsystem
configuration outperforms the empirical decomposition-based control benchmark
by about 20%. The DEMPC architecture further improves the overall performance
of the IES by about 55% compared to the benchmark.

Employing its energy-momentum tensor and going to the non-relativistic limit we
find a locally conserved non-relativistic energy density that is defined via

self-interacting dark matter (DM) model based on the neutron decay anomaly and
a hadronic model obtained from the posterior distribution of a recent Bayesian
analysis, we impose constraints on the DM self-interaction strength using
recent multimessenger astrophysical observations. The constrained DM
interaction strength is then used to estimate DM self-interaction cross section
and shear viscosity resulting from DM, which is found to be several orders of
magnitude smaller than shear viscosity due to hadronic matter. Assuming that
the DM fermion is in chemical equilibrium with the neutrons in the neutron
star, we estimate the bulk viscosity resulting from the dark decay of neutrons,
and find it to be much smaller than the hadronic bulk viscosity. We also
conclude that the $r$-mode instability window with minimal hadronic damping
mechanisms can become smaller when including DM shear and bulk viscosity but
remains incompatible with the X-ray and pulsar observational data for the
chosen DM model.

homomorphisms to the setting of continuous state and action spaces. We derive a
policy gradient theorem on the abstract MDP for both stochastic and
deterministic policies. Our policy gradient results allow for leveraging
approximate symmetries of the environment for policy optimization. Based on
these theorems, we propose a family of actor-critic algorithms that are able to
learn the policy and the MDP homomorphism map simultaneously, using the lax
bisimulation metric. Finally, we introduce a series of environments with
continuous symmetries to further demonstrate the ability of our algorithm for
action abstraction in the presence of such symmetries. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on our environments, as well as on challenging
visual control tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite. Our method's ability to
utilize MDP homomorphisms for representation learning leads to improved
performance, and the visualizations of the latent space clearly demonstrate the

  welcome!",,,,"hep-th hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traditionally, scalar $\phi^4$ theory in four dimensions is thought to be
quantum trivial in the continuum. This tradition is apparently well grounded
both in physics arguments and mathematical proofs. Digging into the proofs one
finds that they do not actually cover all physically meaningful situations, in
particular the case of multi-component fields and non-polynomial action. In
this work, I study multi-component scalar field theories in four dimensions in
the continuum and show that they do evade the apparently foregone conclusion of
triviality. Instead, one finds a non-trivial interacting theory that has two
phases, bound states and non-trivial scattering amplitudes in the limit of many
components. This has potentially broad implications, both for the foundations
of quantum field theory as well as for the experimentally accessible Higgs
sector of the Standard Model.

potentially challenge standard galaxy formation models in the $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. Using a minimal empirical framework, we investigate the influence of
variability on the rest-frame ultra-violet (UV) luminosity function (UVLF) of
galaxies at $z\geq 9$. Our study differentiates between the $\textit{median UV
radiation yield}$ and the $\textit{variability of UV luminosities}$ of galaxies
at a fixed dark matter halo mass. We primarily focus on the latter effect,
which depends on halo assembly and galaxy formation processes and can
significantly increase the abundance of UV-bright galaxies due to the upscatter
of galaxies in lower-mass haloes. We find that a relatively low level of
variability, $\sigma_{\rm UV} \approx 0.75$ mag, matches the observational
constraints at $z\approx 9$. However, increasingly larger $\sigma_{\rm UV}$ is
necessary when moving to higher redshifts, reaching $\sigma_{\rm UV} \approx
2.0\,(2.5)\,{\rm mag}$ at $z\approx 12$ ($16$). This implied variability is
consistent with expectations of physical processes in high-redshift galaxies
such as bursty star formation and cycles of dust clearance. Photometric
constraints from JWST at $z\gtrsim 9$ therefore can be reconciled with a
standard $\Lambda$CDM-based galaxy formation model calibrated at lower
redshifts without the need for adjustments to the median UV radiation yield.

galaxy M74, calibrated by means of MCMC methods.
  We take into account the observed stellar and gas density profiles and use
Bayesian analysis to constrain two fundamental parameters characterising the
gas accretion and star formation timescale, i.e. the infall timescale tau and
the SF efficiency nu, respectively, as a function of galactocentric radius R.
Our analysis supports an infall timescale increasing with R and a star
formation efficiency decreasing with R, thus supporting an 'Inside-Out'
formation for M74. For both tau and nu, we find a weaker radial dependence than
in the Milky Way.
  We also investigate the dust content of M74, comparing the observed dust
density profile with the results of our chemical evolution models. Various
prescriptions have been considered for two key parameters, i.e. the typical
dust accretion timescale and the mass of gas cleared out of the dust by a
supernova remnant, regulating the dust growth and destruction rate,
respectively. Two models with a different current balance between destruction
and accretion, i.e. with equilibrium and dominion of accretion over
destruction, can equally reproduce the observed dust profile of M74. This
outlines the degeneracy between these parameters in shaping the interstellar
dust content in galaxies. Our methods will be extended to more DustPedia
galaxies to shed more light on the relative roles of dust production and
destruction.

that for any target inside a magnetic field, the absorption rate of

the dielectric function. As a result, the plethora of candidate targets
previously identified for sub-GeV dark matter searches can be repurposed as
broadband axion detectors. We find that a $\text{kg} \cdot \text{yr}$ exposure

arises due to the mixing of the electric and chiral charge oscillations induced

classical hardware) of the real-time dynamics of CMWs in Schwinger model. Our
quench protocol is the following: at $t=0$ we suddenly place an electric dipole
at the middle of our lattice. Due to chiral anomaly, this dipole excites the
CMW that propagates towards the edges of the lattice. In Schwinger model tuned
to the conformal critical point (at $\theta = \pi$, $m/g \simeq 0.2$), we find
a gapless linear CMW that propagates with the speed of light. For massless
Schwinger model ($\theta =0, m=0$), we find a gapped linear CMW, in accord with
previous analytical analyses. For massive Schwinger model (that is dual to
strongly interacting bosonic theory), we enter the new regime of nonlinear
CMWs, where we find a surprise. Specifically, for $m/g > 1$, the frequency of
electric charge oscillations becomes much smaller than the frequency of the
oscillations of the chiral charge. For $m/g =4$, we find a solution
corresponding to a nearly static electric dipole with fast oscillations of the
chiral charge confined within. We call this solution a ""thumper"" and study its

  Obtained by Aggregating Case Studies","1,002 authors, 14 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, published by The
  Astrophysical Journal on 2023-05-09, volume 948, page 71",,"10.3847/1538-4357/accc89",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flare frequency distributions represent a key approach to addressing one of
the largest problems in solar and stellar physics: determining the mechanism
that counter-intuitively heats coronae to temperatures that are orders of
magnitude hotter than the corresponding photospheres. It is widely accepted
that the magnetic field is responsible for the heating, but there are two
competing mechanisms that could explain it: nanoflares or Alfv\'en waves. To
date, neither can be directly observed. Nanoflares are, by definition,
extremely small, but their aggregate energy release could represent a
substantial heating mechanism, presuming they are sufficiently abundant. One
way to test this presumption is via the flare frequency distribution, which
describes how often flares of various energies occur. If the slope of the power
law fitting the flare frequency distribution is above a critical threshold,
$\alpha=2$ as established in prior literature, then there should be a
sufficient abundance of nanoflares to explain coronal heating. We performed
$>$600 case studies of solar flares, made possible by an unprecedented number
of data analysts via three semesters of an undergraduate physics laboratory
course. This allowed us to include two crucial, but nontrivial, analysis
methods: pre-flare baseline subtraction and computation of the flare energy,
which requires determining flare start and stop times. We aggregated the
results of these analyses into a statistical study to determine that $\alpha =
1.63 \pm 0.03$. This is below the critical threshold, suggesting that Alfv\'en
waves are an important driver of coronal heating.

in the context of effective field theories. We use tools similar to the soft
bootstrap to build an ansatz for cyclically ordered amplitudes and impose the
Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations as a constraint. We obtain a set of
BCJ-satisfying amplitudes as solutions to our procedure, which can be thought
of as special higher-derivative corrections to SU(N) non-linear sigma model
amplitudes satisfying BCJ relations to arbitrary multiplicity at leading order.
The surprising outcome of our analysis is that BCJ conditions on higher-point
amplitudes impose constraints on lower-point amplitudes, and they relate
coefficients at different orders in the derivative expansion. This shows that
BCJ conditions are much more restrictive than soft limit behavior, allowing
only for a very small set of solutions.

codimension-two duality defects in type IIB string theory predicted by the

$\mathcal{N} = (2,0)$ supersymmetry, wrapping an R7-brane ""at infinity"" leads
to a topological operator associated with a zero-form charge conjugation
symmetry that squares to the identity. Similar considerations hold for those
theories obtained from further toroidal compactification, but this can be
obstructed by bundle curvature effects. Using some minimal data on the
topological sector of the R7-branes, we extract the associated fusion rules for
these charge conjugation operators. More broadly, we sketch a top down
realization of various topological operators / interfaces associated with
$\mathsf{C}$, $\mathsf{R}$, and $\mathsf{T}$ transformations. We also use
holography to provide strong evidence for the existence of the R7-brane which
is complementary to the Cobordism Conjecture. Similar considerations apply to
other string-realized QFTs with symmetry operators constructed via
non-supersymmetric branes which carry a conserved charge.

  with pulsar timing arrays","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Anisotropies in the nanohertz gravitational-wave background are a compelling
next target for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). Measurements or informative upper
limits to the anisotropies are expected in the near future and can offer
important clues about the origin of the background and the properties of the
sources. Given that each source is expected (in the simplest scenario of
circular inspirals) to emit at a fixed frequency, the anisotropy will most
generally vary from one frequency to another. The main result presented in this
work is an analytical model for the anisotropies produced by a population of
inspiralling supermassive black-hole binaries (SMBHBs). This model can be
immediately connected with parametrizations of the SMBHB mass function and can
be easily expanded to account for new physical processes taking place within
the PTA frequency band. We show that a variety of SMBHB models predict
significant levels of anistropy at the highest frequencies accessible to PTA
observations and that measurements of anisotropies can offer new information
regarding this population beyond the isotropic component. We also model the
impact of additional dynamical effects driving the binary towards merger and
show that, if these processes are relevant within the PTA band, the
detectability of anisotropies relative to the isotropic background will be
enhanced. Finally, we use the formalism presented in this work to predict the
level anisotropy of the circular and linear polarizations of the SGWB due to
the distribution of binary orientation angles with respect to the line of
sight.

metric, which has integrable geodesics. This property is crucial to produce
accurate waveforms from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. Astrophysical
environments, modifications of gravity and new fundamental fields may lead to
nonintegrable geodesics, inducing chaotic effects. We study geodesics around
self-interacting rotating boson stars and find robust evidence of
nonintegrability and chaos. We identify islands of stability around resonant
orbits, where the orbital radial and polar oscillation frequency ratios, known
as rotation numbers, remain constant throughout the island. These islands are
generically present both in the exterior and the interior of compact boson
stars. A monotonicity change of rotation curves takes place as orbits travel
from the exterior to the interior of the star. Therefore, configurations with
neutron-star-like compactness can support degenerate resonant islands. This
anomaly is reported here for the first time and it is not present in black
holes. Such configurations can also support extremely prolonged resonant
islands that span from the exterior to the interior of the star and are
shielded by thick chaotic layers. We adiabatically evolve inspirals using
approximated post-Newtonian fluxes and find time-dependent plateaus in the
rotation curves which are associated with island-crossing orbits. Crossings of
external islands give rise to typical gravitational-wave glitches found in
non-Kerr objects. Furthermore, when an inspiral is traversing an internal
island that is surrounded by a thick chaotic layer, a new type of simultaneous
multifrequency glitch occurs that may be detectable with space interferometers
such as LISA, and can serve as evidence of an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral
around a supermassive boson star.

galactic nuclei (AGN) with decreasing projected separation for close galaxy
pairs, relative to control galaxies. This implies galaxy interactions play a
role in enhancing AGN activity. However, the picture at higher redshift is less
established, partly due to limited spectroscopic redshifts. We combine
spectroscopic surveys with photometric redshift probability distribution
functions for galaxies in the CANDELS and COSMOS surveys, to produce the
largest ever sample of galaxy pairs used in an AGN fraction calculation for
cosmic noon ($0.5<z<3$). We present a new technique for assessing galaxy pair
probability (based on line-of-sight velocities +/-1000 km/s) from photometric
redshift posterior convolutions and use these to produce weighted AGN
fractions. Over projected separations 5-100kpc we find no evidence for
enhancement, relative to isolated control galaxies, of X-ray (L_X > 10^42
erg/s) or infrared-selected AGN in major (mass ratios up to 4:1) or minor (4:1
to 10:1) galaxy pairs. However, defining the most obscured AGN as those
detected in the infrared but not in X-rays, we observe a trend of increasing
obscured AGN enhancement at decreasing separations. The peak enhancement,
relative to isolated controls, is a factor of 2.08+/-0.61 for separations
<25kpc. Our simulations with mock data, indicates this could be a lower limit
of the true enhancement. If confirmed with improved infrared imaging (e.g.,
with JWST) and redshifts (e.g., with forthcoming multi-object spectrograph
surveys), this would suggest that galaxy interactions play a role in enhancing
the most obscured black hole growth at cosmic noon.

whereby many constrained simulations can be judged and the ''best'' initial

to the observed clusters. Their merit is determined against a null hypothesis,
the probability that such a counterpart could be identified in a random,
unconstrained simulation. This model is applied to 100 constrained simulations
using the Cosmicflows-3 data. Cluster counterparts are found for all

$0.8-1.1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarf (WD) can detonate
the CO WD and create a thermonuclear supernova (SN). Many authors have recently
shown that when the mass of the He layer is low ($\lesssim
0.03\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), the ashes from its detonation minimally impact the
spectra and light-curve from the CO detonation, allowing the explosion to
appear remarkably similar to Type Ia SNe. These new insights motivate our
investigation of dynamical He shell burning, and our search for a binary
scenario that stably accumulates thermally unstable He shells in the
$0.01-0.08\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ range, thick enough to detonate, but also often
thin enough for minimal impact on the observables. We first show that our
improved non-adiabatic evolution of convective He shell burning in this shell
mass range leads to conditions ripe for a He detonation. We also find that a
stable mass-transfer scenario with a high entropy He WD donor of mass
$0.15-0.25\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ yields the He shell masses needed to achieve the
double detonations. This scenario also predicts that the surviving He donor
leaves with a space velocity consistent with the unusual runaway object, D6-2.
We find that hot He WD donors originate in common envelope events when a
$1.3-2.0\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ star fills its Roche lobe at the base of the red

the impact of resolution and box size, which is at most 600 comoving Mpc. Large
density contrasts arise at late times, which may explain the KBC void and
Hubble tension. We quantify the mass function of formed structures at different
redshifts. We show that the sterile neutrino mass fraction in these structures
is similar to the cosmic fraction at high masses (consistent with MOND
dynamical analyses) but approaches zero at lower masses, as expected for
galaxies. We also identify structures with a low peculiar velocity comparable
to the Local Group, but these are rare. The onset of group/cluster scale
structure formation at $z_e\approx4$ appears to be in tension with observations
of high redshift galaxies, which we discuss in comparison to prior analytical

1214 b has been observed to be flat and featureless, implying a high
metallicity atmosphere with abundant aerosols. Recent JWST MIRI LRS
observations of a phase curve of GJ 1214 b showed that its transmission
spectrum is flat out into the mid-infrared. In this paper, we use the combined
near- and mid-infrared transmission spectrum of GJ 1214 b to constrain its
atmospheric composition and aerosol properties. We generate a grid of
photochemical haze models using an aerosol microphysics code for a number of
background atmospheres spanning metallicities from 100 to 1000 $\times$ solar,
as well as a steam atmosphere scenario. The flatness of the combined data set
largely rules out atmospheric metallicities $\leq$300 $\times$ solar due to
their large corresponding molecular feature amplitudes, preferring values
$\geq$1000 $\times$ solar and column haze production rates $\geq$10$^{-10}$ g
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The steam atmosphere scenario with similarly high haze
production rates also exhibit sufficiently small molecular features to be
consistent with the transmission spectrum. These compositions imply that
atmospheric mean molecular weights $\geq$15 g mol$^{-1}$ are needed to fit the
data. Our results suggest that haze production is highly efficient on GJ 1214 b
and could involve non-hydrocarbon, non-nitrogen haze precursors. Further
characterization of GJ 1214 b's atmosphere would likely require multiple
transits and eclipses using JWST across the near and mid-infrared, potentially
complemented by groundbased high resolution transmission spectroscopy.

reflectance spectra. Neural networks are useful tools for analysing reflectance
spectra and determining material composition with high precision and low
processing time. Aims. We applied neural-network models on disk-resolved
spectra of the Eros and Itokawa asteroids observed by the NEAR Shoemaker and
Hayabusa spacecraft. With this approach, the mineral variations or intensity of
space weathering can be mapped. Methods. We tested two types of convolutional
neural networks. The first one was trained using asteroid reflectance spectra
with known taxonomy classes. The other one used silicate reflectance spectra
with assigned mineral abundances and compositions. Results. The reliability of
the classification model depends on the resolution of reflectance spectra.
Typical F1 score and Cohen's ${\kappa}_C$ values decrease from about 0.90 for
high-resolution spectra to about 0.70 for low-resolution spectra. The predicted
silicate composition does not strongly depend on spectrum resolution and
coverage of the 2${\mu}$m band of pyroxene. The typical root mean square error
is between 6 and 10 percentage points. For the Eros and Itokawa asteroids, the
predicted taxonomy classes favour the S-type and the predicted surface
compositions are homogeneous and correspond to the composition of L/LL and LL
ordinary chondrites, respectively. On the Itokawa surface, the model identified
fresh spots that were connected with craters or coarse-grain areas.
Conclusions. The neural network models trained with measured spectra of
asteroids and silicate samples are suitable for deriving surface silicate
mineralogy with a reasonable level of accuracy. The predicted surface
mineralogy is comparable to the mineralogy of returned samples measured in the
laboratory. Moreover, the taxonomical predictions can point out locations of
fresher areas.

agreement with cosmological data. Despite this observational success, it is
still lacking a robust embedding into a UV complete theory. Previous efforts to
derive Starobinsky inflation from string theory have been based on the
derivation of higher derivative curvature terms from the low-energy limit of
ten-dimensional string theory. This approach is however known to fail due to
the difficulty to tame the effect of contributions proportional to the Ricci
scalar to a power larger than two. In this paper we investigate an alternative
attempt which exploits instead the ubiquitous presence of scalar fields in
string compactifications combined with the fact that Starobinsky inflation can
be recast as Einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field with a precise
potential and conformal coupling to matter fermions. We focus in particular on
type IIB K\""ahler moduli since they have shown to lead to exponential
potentials with a Starobinsky-like plateau. We consider three classes of moduli
with a different topological origin: the volume modulus, bulk fibre moduli, and
blow-up modes. The only modulus with the correct coupling to matter is the
volume mode but its potential does not feature any plateau at large field
values. Fibre moduli admit instead a potential very similar to Starobinsky
inflation with a natural suppression of higher curvature corrections, but they
cannot reproduce the correct conformal coupling to matter. Blow-up modes have
both a wrong potential and a wrong coupling. Our analysis implies therefore
that embedding Starobinsky inflation into string theory seems rather hard.
Finally, it provides a detailed derivation of the coupling to matter of fibre
moduli which could be used as a way to discriminate Starobinsky from fibre
inflation.

symmetry of the vertex is properly exploited. The planar degeneracy leads to a
particularly simple parametrization of the vertex, reducing its kinematic
dependence to essentially a single variable. Our analysis, carried out in the
absence of dynamical quarks, reveals that the planar degeneracy is particularly
accurate for the description of the form factor associated with the classical
tensor, for a wide array of arbitrary kinematic configurations. Instead, the
remaining three form factors display considerable violations of this property.
In addition, and in close connection with the previous point, we demonstrate
the numerical dominance of the classical form factor over all others, except in
the vicinity of the soft-gluon kinematics. The final upshot of these
considerations is the emergence of a very compact description for the
three-gluon vertex in general kinematics, which may simplify significantly
nonperturbative applications involving this vertex.

different ensemble approaches to improve VPR performance. Ideas like
multi-process fusion or switching involve combining different VPR techniques
together, utilizing different strategies. One major aspect often common to many
of these strategies is voting. Voting is widely used in many ensemble methods,
so it is potentially a relevant subject to explore in terms of its application
and significance for improving VPR performance. This paper attempts to looks
into detail and analyze a variety of voting schemes to evaluate which voting
technique is optimal for an ensemble VPR set up. We take inspiration from a
variety of voting schemes that exist and are widely employed in other research
fields such as politics and sociology. The idea is inspired by an observation
that different voting methods result in different outcomes for the same type of
data and each voting scheme is utilized for specific cases in different
academic fields. Some of these voting schemes include Condorcet voting, Broda
Count and Plurality voting. Voting employed in any aspect requires that a fair
system be established, that outputs the best and most favourable results which
in our case would involve improving VPR performance. We evaluate some of these
voting techniques in a standardized testing of different VPR techniques, using
a variety of VPR data sets. We aim to determine whether a single optimal voting
scheme exists or, much like in other fields of research, the selection of a
voting technique is relative to its application and environment. We also aim to
propose a ranking of these different voting methods from best to worst
according to our results as this will allow for better selection of voting
schemes.

Here we propose and demonstrate the first Floquet-Lieb topological photonic
insulator with all flat bands which can support continuous edge mode
transmission across multiple Floquet-Brillouin zones. This supercontinuum of
edge states results from the orthogonality between the flat-band modes and the
edge states, allowing for continuous excitation of the latter without
scattering into the bulk modes. Moreover, we show that these flat bands are
perfectly immune to random variations in the on-site potential, regardless of
how large the perturbations are, thus ensuring complete robustness of the edge
modes to this type of disorder. We realized Floquet-Lieb insulators using 2D
microring resonator lattices with perfect nearest-neighbor couplings.
Transmission measurements and direct imaging of the scattered light
distributions showed an edge mode supercontinuum spanning more than three
microring free spectral ranges. These broad edge mode transmission bands
persisted even in the presence of lattice disorder caused by fabrication
imperfection. The proposed Floquet-Lieb insulator can potentially be used to
realize topological photonic devices with ultrawide bandwidths and super

In this work, we show how language models, without any architecture

language models trained directly on sequences derived directly from chemical

on chemical file sequences -- language models still achieve performance
comparable to state-of-the-art models that use graph and graph-derived string

doing so, we demonstrate that it is not necessary to use simplified molecular

The cold gas disc is now well settled, which suggests that the galaxy has not

nontrivial to perform information extraction (IE) tasks with NL-LLMs since the
output of the IE task is usually structured and therefore is hard to be
converted into plain text. In this paper, we propose to recast the structured
output in the form of code instead of natural language and utilize generative
LLMs of code (Code-LLMs) such as Codex to perform IE tasks, in particular,
named entity recognition and relation extraction. In contrast to NL-LLMs, we
show that Code-LLMs can be well-aligned with these IE tasks by designing
code-style prompts and formulating these IE tasks as code generation tasks.
Experiment results on seven benchmarks show that our method consistently
outperforms fine-tuning moderate-size pre-trained models specially designed for
IE tasks (e.g., UIE) and prompting NL-LLMs under few-shot settings. We further
conduct a series of in-depth analyses to demonstrate the merits of leveraging

often underperform in minimally connected networks where holes are larger and
more frequent. Minimal density networks are common in practice due to
deployment cost constraints, mobility dynamics, and/or adversarial jamming.
Protocols that use global search to determine optimal paths incur search
overhead that limits scaling. Conversely, protocols that use local search tend
to find approximately optimal paths at higher densities due to the existence of
geometrically direct routes but underperform as the connectivity lowers and
regional (or global) information is required to address holes. Designing a
routing protocol to achieve high throughput-latency performance across network
densities, mobility, and interference dynamics remains challenging.
  This paper shows that, in a probabilistic setting, bounded exploration can be
leveraged to mitigate this challenge. We show, first, that the length of
shortest paths in networks with uniform random node distribution can, with high
probability (whp), be bounded. Thus, whp a shortest path may be found by
limiting exploration to an elliptic region whose size is a function of the
network density and the Euclidean distance between the two endpoints. Second,
we propose a geographic routing protocol that achieves high reliability and
throughput-latency performance by forwarding packets within an ellipse whose
size is bounded similarly and by an estimate of the available capacity. Our
protocol, QF-Geo, selects forwarding relays within the elliptic region,
prioritizing those with sufficient capacity to avoid bottlenecks. Our
simulation results show that QF-Geo achieves high goodput efficiency and
reliability in both static and mobile networks across both low and high
densities, at large scales, with a wide range of concurrent flows, and in the

Vision-language models can go beyond recognizing the objects in an image and

of native structures from their decoy sets. This work presents the construction
of two different distance-dependent potential energy functions based on two
fundamental assumptions using mathematical modeling. Here, a model was
developed using basic mathematical methods, and the carbon-alpha form is the
simplest form of protein representation. We aimed to reduce computational
volume and distinguish the native structure from the decoy structures. For this
purpose, according to Anfinsens dogma, we assumed that the energy of each model
structure should be more favorable than the corresponding native type. In the
second one, we thought that the energy difference between the native and decoy
structures changes linearly with the root-mean-square deviation of structures.
These knowledge-based potentials are expressed by the B-spline basis functions
of the pairwise distances between Ca-Ca of inter-residues. The potential
function parameters in the above two approaches were optimized using the linear
programming algorithm on a massive collection of Titan-HRD and tested on the
remainder. We found that the potential functions produced by Anfinsens dogma
detect native structures more accurately than those developed by the
root-mean-square deviation. Both linear programming knowledge-based potentials
(LPKP) successfully detect the native structures from an ensemble of decoys.
However, the LPKP of the first approach can correctly identify 130 native
structures out of 150 tested cases with an average rank of 1.67. While the
second approach LPKP detects 124 native structures from their decoys. We
concluded that linear programming is promising for generating knowledge-based

environmental and climate justice dimensions of the way algorithmic systems are
designed, developed, and deployed? These impacts are inherently emergent and
can only be understood and addressed at the level of relations between an
algorithmic system and the social (including institutional) and ecological
components of the broader ecosystem it operates in. As a result, we claim that
in absence of an integral ontology for algorithmic systems, we cannot do
justice to the emergent nature of broader environmental impacts of algorithmic
systems and their underlying computational infrastructure. We propose to define
algorithmic systems as ontologically indistinct from
Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS), framing emergent implications
as couplings between social, ecological, and technical components of the
broader fabric in which algorithms are integrated and operate. We draw upon
prior work on SETS analysis as well as emerging themes in the literature and
practices of Environmental Justice (EJ) to conceptualize and assess algorithmic
impact. We then offer three policy recommendations to help establish a
SETS-based EJ approach to algorithmic audits: (1) broaden the inputs and
open-up the outputs of an audit, (2) enable meaningful access to redress, and
(3) guarantee a place-based and relational approach to the process of
evaluating impact. We operationalize these as a qualitative framework of
questions for a spectrum of stakeholders. Doing so, this article aims to

ability to experimentally explore the world? In this work we seriously consider
this question. We assume the existence of statements whose truth value is not
experimentally accessible. That is, there is no way, not even in theory, to
directly test if these statements are true or false. We further develop a
theory in which experimentally accessible statements are a union of a fixed
minimum number of inaccessible statements. For example, the value of truth of
the statements ""a"" and ""b"" is not accessible, but the value of truth of the
statement ""a or b"" is accessible. We do not directly assume probability theory,
we exclusively define experimentally accessible and inaccessible statements and
build on these notions using the rules of classical logic. We find that an
interesting structure emerges. Developing this theory, we relax the logical
structure to a probabilistic one, obtaining a theory rich in structure that we
call ""theory of inaccessible information"". Surprisingly, the simplest model of
theory of inaccessible information is the qubit in quantum mechanics. Along the
path for the construction of this theory, we characterise and study a family of
multiplicative information measures that we call ""inaccessibility measures"".

human-like speeches, which has been used in deepfakes or identity theft
attacks. Existing defense mechanisms inject subtle adversarial perturbations
into the raw speech audios to mislead the voice synthesis models. However,
optimizing the adversarial perturbation not only consumes substantial
computation time, but it also requires the availability of entire speech.
Therefore, they are not suitable for protecting live speech streams, such as
voice messages or online meetings. In this paper, we propose VSMask, a
real-time protection mechanism against voice synthesis attacks. Different from
offline protection schemes, VSMask leverages a predictive neural network to
forecast the most effective perturbation for the upcoming streaming speech.
VSMask introduces a universal perturbation tailored for arbitrary speech input
to shield a real-time speech in its entirety. To minimize the audio distortion
within the protected speech, we implement a weight-based perturbation
constraint to reduce the perceptibility of the added perturbation. We
comprehensively evaluate VSMask protection performance under different
scenarios. The experimental results indicate that VSMask can effectively defend
against 3 popular voice synthesis models. None of the synthetic voice could
deceive the speaker verification models or human ears with VSMask protection.
In a physical world experiment, we demonstrate that VSMask successfully
safeguards the real-time speech by injecting the perturbation over the air.

face. In these simulations, the $\alpha$ phase consisted of pure HCP Ti whereas
the $\beta$ phase was modeled as Ti$_{60}$Nb$_{40}$ BCC random alloy using a
Ti-Nb interatomic potential. Firstly, the misfit dislocations structure on the
$\alpha-\beta$ interface side face has been characterized from MS simulations.
This predicted dislocation structure is in good agreement with experimental
observations in Ti-alloys. Secondly, MD simulations of the interaction of
$[a_1]$, $[a_2]$, and $[a_3]$ prismatic screw dislocations with the interface
side face in an $\alpha-\beta$ bi-crystal were performed at different

of dislocation transmission was found. The origin of this anisotropy in the
slip transmission is due to the relative misalignment of the slip systems
between the $\alpha$ and the $\beta$ phases from the Burgers orientation
relationship. Finally, the mechanisms of slip transmission of each dislocation

in edge devices have enabled ML-driven disease detection for smart healthcare.
Conventional ML-driven disease detection methods rely on customizing individual
models for each disease and its corresponding WMS data. However, such methods
lack adaptability to distribution shifts and new task classification classes.
Also, they need to be rearchitected and retrained from scratch for each new
disease. Moreover, installing multiple ML models in an edge device consumes
excessive memory, drains the battery faster, and complicates the detection
process. To address these challenges, we propose DOCTOR, a multi-disease
detection continual learning (CL) framework based on WMSs. It employs a
multi-headed deep neural network (DNN) and an exemplar-replay-style CL
algorithm. The CL algorithm enables the framework to continually learn new
missions where different data distributions, classification classes, and
disease detection tasks are introduced sequentially. It counteracts
catastrophic forgetting with a data preservation method and a synthetic data
generation module. The data preservation method efficiently preserves the most
informative subset of training data from previous missions based on the average
training loss of each data instance. The synthetic data generation module
models the probability distribution of the real training data and then
generates as much synthetic data as needed for replays while maintaining data
privacy. The multi-headed DNN enables DOCTOR to detect multiple diseases
simultaneously based on user WMS data. We demonstrate DOCTOR's efficacy in
maintaining high multi-disease classification accuracy with a single DNN model
in various CL experiments. DOCTOR achieves very competitive performance across
all CL scenarios relative to the ideal joint-training framework while
maintaining a small model size.

as a graph where the nodes are sensors that measure traffic metrics (such as
speed) at that location. Traffic forecasting is interesting because it is
complex as the future speed of a road is dependent on a number of different
factors. Therefore, to properly forecast traffic, we need a model that is
capable of capturing all these different factors. A factor that is missing from
the existing works is the node interactions factor. Existing works fail to
capture the inter-node interactions because none are using the message-passing
flavor of GNN, which is the one best suited to capture the node interactions
This paper presents a plausible scenario in road traffic where node
interactions are important and argued that the most appropriate GNN flavor to
capture node interactions is message-passing. Results from real-world data show
the superiority of the message-passing flavor for traffic forecasting. An
additional experiment using synthetic data shows that the message-passing
flavor can capture inter-node interaction better than other flavors.

whether batters in Major League Baseball should swing at a pitch. Unlike
traditional plate discipline metrics, which implicitly assume that all batters

zone, our approach explicitly accounts not only for the players and umpires
involved but also in-game contextual information like the number of outs, the
count, baserunners, and score. Specifically, we first fit flexible Bayesian
nonparametric models to estimate (i) the probability that the pitch is called a
strike if the batter takes the pitch; (ii) the probability that the batter
makes contact if he swings; and (iii) the number of runs the batting team is
expected to score following each pitch outcome (e.g. swing and miss, take a
called strike, etc.). We then combine these intermediate estimates to determine
whether swinging increases the batting team's run expectancy. Our approach
enables natural uncertainty propagation so that we can not only determine the
optimal swing/take decision but also quantify our confidence in that decision.

Weyl semimetals composed by porous Ge and SiGe structures. These systems are
energetically stable graphenylene-like structures with a buckling,
spontaneously breaking the inversion symmetry. The nontrivial topological phase
for these 2D systems occurs just below the Fermi level, resulting in
nonvanishing Berry curvature around the Weyl nodes. The emerged Weyl semimetals
are protected by $C_3$ symmetry, presenting one-dimensional edge Fermi-arcs
connecting Weyl points with opposite chiralities. Our findings complete the
family of Weyl in condensed-matter physics, by predicting the first
noncentrosymmetric class of 2D Weyl semimetals.

weights multiple poorly-performing groups (instead of considering just the

fixed cycle times for actions. As practitioners need to choose the action-cycle
time for a given task, a significant concern is whether the hyper-parameters of
the learning algorithm need to be re-tuned for each choice of the cycle time,
which is prohibitive for real-world robotics. In this work, we investigate the
widely-used baseline hyper-parameter values of two policy gradient algorithms
-- PPO and SAC -- across different cycle times. Using a benchmark task where
the baseline hyper-parameters of both algorithms were shown to work well, we
reveal that when a cycle time different than the task default is chosen, PPO
with baseline hyper-parameters fails to learn. Moreover, both PPO and SAC with
their baseline hyper-parameters perform substantially worse than their tuned
values for each cycle time. We propose novel approaches for setting these
hyper-parameters based on the cycle time. In our experiments on simulated and
real-world robotic tasks, the proposed approaches performed at least as well as
the baseline hyper-parameters, with significantly better performance for most
choices of the cycle time, and did not result in learning failure for any cycle
time. Hyper-parameter tuning still remains a significant barrier for real-world
robotics, as our approaches require some initial tuning on a new task, even
though it is negligible compared to an extensive tuning for each cycle time.
Our approach requires no additional tuning after the cycle time is changed for
a given task and is a step toward avoiding extensive and costly hyper-parameter
tuning for real-world policy optimization.

  - At super logarithmic circuit depth $d=\omega(\log(n))$, any learning

  - There exists a $d=O(n)$, such that any learning algorithm requires

these performance degradations by providing FR models with sample-quality
predictions that can be used to reject low-quality samples and reduce false
match errors. However, despite steady improvements, ensuring reliable quality
estimates across facial images with diverse characteristics remains
challenging. In this paper, we present a powerful new FIQA approach, named
DifFIQA, which relies on denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) and
ensures highly competitive results. The main idea behind the approach is to
utilize the forward and backward processes of DDPMs to perturb facial images
and quantify the impact of these perturbations on the corresponding image
embeddings for quality prediction. Because the diffusion-based perturbations
are computationally expensive, we also distill the knowledge encoded in DifFIQA

performance and execution time. We evaluate both models in comprehensive

compressible Navier--Stokes equations, with desired properties including high
order spatial accuracy, conservation, and positivity-preserving of density and
internal energy under a standard hyperbolic type CFL constraint on the time
step size, e.g., $\Delta t=\mathcal O(\Delta x)$. Strang splitting is used to
approximate convection and diffusion operators separately. For the convection
part, i.e., the compressible Euler equation, the high order accurate
postivity-preserving Runge--Kutta discontinuous Galerkin method can be used.
For the diffusion part, the equation of internal energy instead of the total
energy is considered, and a first order semi-implicit time discretization is
used for the ease of achieving positivity. A suitable interior penalty
discontinuous Galerkin method for the stress tensor can ensure the conservation
of momentum and total energy for any high order polynomial basis. In
particular, positivity can be proven with $\Delta t=\mathcal{O}(\Delta x)$ if
the Laplacian operator of internal energy is approximated by the $\mathbb{Q}^k$
spectral element method with $k=1,2,3$. So the full scheme with $\mathbb{Q}^k$
($k=1,2,3$) basis is conservative and positivity-preserving with $\Delta
t=\mathcal{O}(\Delta x)$, which is robust for demanding problems such as
solutions with low density and low pressure induced by high-speed shock
diffraction. Even though the full scheme is only first order accurate in time,
numerical tests indicate that higher order polynomial basis produces much
better numerical solutions, e.g., better resolution for capturing the roll-ups

we identify the underlying topology by analyzing the closure of all

Moreover, we create an OMP\_Serial dataset with 18598 parallelizable and 13972

the human skeleton is usually modeled as an undirected graph whose nodes are
body joints and edges are connections between neighboring joints. However, most
of these methods tend to focus on learning relationships between body joints of
the skeleton using first-order neighbors, ignoring higher-order neighbors and
hence limiting their ability to exploit relationships between distant joints.
In this paper, we introduce a higher-order regular splitting graph network
(RS-Net) for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation using matrix splitting in
conjunction with weight and adjacency modulation. The core idea is to capture
long-range dependencies between body joints using multi-hop neighborhoods and
also to learn different modulation vectors for different body joints as well as
a modulation matrix added to the adjacency matrix associated to the skeleton.
This learnable modulation matrix helps adjust the graph structure by adding
extra graph edges in an effort to learn additional connections between body
joints. Instead of using a shared weight matrix for all neighboring body
joints, the proposed RS-Net model applies weight unsharing before aggregating
the feature vectors associated to the joints in order to capture the different
relations between them. Experiments and ablations studies performed on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving
superior performance over recent state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose

generalize when there is a significant domain (i.e., distributional) shift

phenomenon in which models well represent data but fail to generalize an
underlying data generating process. A typical procedure for circumventing
overfitting computes empirical risk on a holdout set and halts once (or flags

well-generalizing model, but justification for why it works is primarily
heuristic.
  We discuss the overfitting problem and explain why standard asymptotic and
concentration results do not hold for evaluation with training data. We then
proceed to introduce and argue for a hypothesis test by means of which both
model performance may be evaluated using training data, and overfitting
quantitatively defined and detected. We rely on said concentration bounds which
guarantee that empirical means should, with high probability, approximate their
true mean to conclude that they should approximate each other. We stipulate
conditions under which this test is valid, describe how the test may be used

will only be in a suitable frequency band briefly when it is close to periapsis

band is the gravitational wave peep. While a single peep is not likely to be
detectable, if we consider an ensemble of such subthreshold sources, spread
across the universe, together they produce an unresolvable background noise
that may obscure sources otherwise detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space

of the extreme mass ratio burst signal confusion background focused more on
parabolic orbits going very near the supermassive black hole and on events near

numerical kludge waveforms that can calculate highly eccentric orbits with
relativistic effects focusing on orbits which are farther away from the

will otherwise contribute to the background signal confusion noise. Here we

  Pair-Instability Supernova Candidate, to date","Submitted to A&A, 44 pages, main text 38 pages, 37 figures, 16 Tables",,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Abridged - Stars with ZAMS masses between 140 and $260 M_\odot$ are thought
to explode as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). During their thermonuclear
runaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive
nickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous
supernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far.
SN2018ibb is a H-poor SLSN at $z=0.166$ that evolves extremely slowly compared
to the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored
its photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the NIR with 2-10m
class telescopes. SN2018ibb radiated $>3\times10^{51} \rm erg$ during its
evolution, and its bolometric light curve reached $>2\times10^{44} \rm
erg\,s^{-1}$ at peak. The long-lasting rise of $>93$ rest-frame days implies a
long diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN
mechanism naturally provides both the energy source ($^{56}$Ni) and the long
diffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions for their
photometric and spectroscopic properties. SN2018ibb complies with most tests on
the light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, potentially all tests with
the interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require
25-44 $M_\odot$ of freshly nucleosynthesised $^{56}$Ni, pointing to the
explosion of a metal-poor star with a He-core mass of 120-130 $M_\odot$ at the
time of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection
of [Co II]$\lambda$1.025$\mu$m, which has never been observed in any other PISN
candidate or SLSN before. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a
black hole, can be excluded with high confidence. This makes SN2018ibb by far
the best candidate for being a PISN, to date.

concrete dropout and batch ensemble. Additionally, we introduce a novel

perform multiple tasks without changing any network properties. Enabling
artificial neural networks (ANNs) to obtain certain multistabilities in order

explore how the relationship between different attractors influences the
ability of a reservoir computer (RC), which is a dynamical system in the form
of an ANN, to achieve multifunctionality. We construct the `seeing double'
problem to systematically study how a RC reconstructs a coexistence of
attractors when there is an overlap between them. As the amount of overlap
increases, we discover that for multifunctionality to occur, there is a
critical dependence on a suitable choice of the spectral radius for the RC's
internal network connections. A bifurcation analysis reveals how
multifunctionality emerges and is destroyed as the RC enters a chaotic regime
that can lead to chaotic itinerancy.

supervision has garnered increasing attention due to its low annotation cost
compared to pixel-level annotation. Most existing methods rely on Class
Activation Maps (CAM) to generate pixel-level pseudo labels for supervised
training. However, it is well known that CAM often suffers from partial
activation -- activating the most discriminative part instead of the entire
object area, and false activation -- unnecessarily activating the background
around the object. In this study, we introduce a simple yet effective approach
to address these limitations by harnessing the recently released Segment
Anything Model (SAM) to generate higher-quality pseudo labels with CAM. SAM is
a segmentation foundation model that demonstrates strong zero-shot ability in
partitioning images into segments but lacks semantic labels for these regions.
To circumvent this, we employ pseudo labels for a specific class as the signal
to select the most relevant masks and label them to generate the refined pseudo
labels for this class. The segments generated by SAM are highly precise,
leading to substantial improvements in partial and false activation. Moreover,
existing post-processing modules for producing pseudo labels, such as
AffinityNet, are often computationally heavy, with a significantly long
training time. Surprisingly, we discovered that using the initial CAM with SAM
can achieve on-par performance as the post-processed pseudo label generated
from these modules with much less computational cost. Our approach is highly
versatile and capable of seamless integration into existing WSSS models without
modification to base networks or pipelines. Despite its simplicity, our
approach improves the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of pseudo labels from
five state-of-the-art WSSS methods by 6.2\% on average on the PASCAL VOC 2012

two types of distribution shifts: diversity shifts, which occur when test
samples exhibit patterns unseen during training, and correlation shifts, which
occur when test data present a different correlation between seen invariant and
spurious features. We propose an integrated protocol to analyze both types of

apply our approach to a real-world classification problem of skin cancer

Our protocol reveals three findings: 1) Models learn and propagate correlation
shifts even with low-bias training; this poses a risk of accumulating and
combining unaccountable weak biases; 2) Models learn robust features in high-
and low-bias scenarios but use spurious ones if test samples have them; this
suggests that spurious correlations do not impair the learning of robust
features; 3) Diversity shift can reduce the reliance on spurious correlations;
this is counter intuitive since we expect biased models to depend more on
biases when invariant features are missing. Our work has implications for
distribution shift research and practice, providing new insights into how
models learn and rely on spurious correlations under different types of shifts.

the environmental conditions and cognitive capabilities that enable contextual

common assumptions, the sender's awareness of the context appears to be
required for contextual communication. We suggest that context-dependent

the best of our knowledge, these are the highest efficiency levels achieved in
air-fabricated QLEDs. Importantly, the demonstrated devices show significant
suppression of non-radiative Auger recombination and optimal charge balance,
leading to negligible EQE roll-off (i.e., droop-free behavior) at the maximum
luminance level. Furthermore, employing a refractive-index-matched optical

the borrowers' socioeconomic characteristics are better than those of rejected

dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. In this problem, fixed resources
must be allocated to serve customers over a finite horizon, while customers
arrive according to a stochastic process. The typical NRM model assumes that
customer arrivals are independent over time. However, in this paper, we explore
a more general setting where customer arrivals over different periods can be
correlated. We propose a new model that assumes the existence of a system
state, which determines customer arrivals for the current period. This system
state evolves over time according to a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain. Our
model can be used to represent correlation in various settings and synthesizes
previous literature on correlation models.
  To solve the NRM problem under our correlated model, we derive a new linear
programming (LP) approximation of the optimal policy. Our approximation
provides a tighter upper bound on the total expected value collected by the
optimal policy than existing upper bounds. We use our LP to develop a new bid
price policy, which computes bid prices for each system state and time period
in a backward induction manner. The decision is then made by comparing the
reward of the customer against the associated bid prices. Our policy guarantees
to collect at least $1/(1+L)$ fraction of the total reward collected by the
optimal policy, where $L$ denotes the maximum number of resources required by a
customer.
  In summary, our work presents a new model for correlated customer arrivals in

in resolution when increasing the field-of-view given a fixed acquisition time.
To address this issue, we propose a novel reference-based super-resolution
(RefSR) framework to preserve the resolution of the OCT angiograms while
increasing the scanning area. Specifically, textures from the normal RefSR
pipeline are used to train a learnable texture generator (LTG), which is
designed to generate textures according to the input. The key difference
between the proposed method and traditional RefSR models is that the textures
used during inference are generated by the LTG instead of being searched from a
single reference image. Since the LTG is optimized throughout the whole
training process, the available texture space is significantly enlarged and no
longer limited to a single reference image, but extends to all textures
contained in the training samples. Moreover, our proposed LTGNet does not
require a reference image at the inference phase, thereby becoming invulnerable
to the selection of the reference image. Both experimental and visual results
show that LTGNet has superior performance and robustness over state-of-the-art
methods, indicating good reliability and promise in real-life deployment. The

and build a reversible bijective mapping between input secret data and

input latent of Glow model to generate stego images. By reversing the mapping,
hidden data can be extracted exactly from generated stego images. Furthermore,
we propose a novel latent optimization strategy to improve the fidelity of

simultaneously conducting the appearance as well as structure modeling. It
employs the structural feature to guide the appearance enhancement, leading to

implemented as the edge detection in low-light images. It is achieved with a
modified generative model via designing a structure-aware feature extractor and

with a simple U-Net, a novel structure-guided enhancement module is proposed
with structure-guided feature synthesis layers. The appearance modeling, edge

learn for distinctive point clouds based on a self-attentive point searching

searching, we first learn the distinction score for each point to reveal the
distinction distribution of the point cloud. After ranking the learned
distinction scores, we group a point cloud into a high distinctive point set
and a low distinctive one to enrich the fine-grained point cloud structure. To
generate a compact feature representation for each distinctive point set, a
stacked self-gated convolution is proposed to extract the distinctive features.
Finally, we further introduce a learnable feature fusion mechanism to aggregate
multiple distinctive features into a global point cloud representation in a
channel-wise aggregation manner. The results also show that the learned
distinction distribution of a point cloud is highly consistent with objects of
the same class and different from objects of other classes. Extensive

to traditional white dwarf models assuming they are mostly made of nuclei

ratios in heavy elements, the electron number density in white dwarf matter is
effectively reduced, which reduces the pressure with additional contributions
of lattice energy and electron polarization corrections. This consequently
leads to white dwarfs with much smaller masses and radii, which coincide with
the seven ultra low-mass and small-radius white dwarfs. The corresponding
equation of state and matter contents of dense stellar matter with and without
reaching the cold-catalyzed ground state are presented, which are obtained
using the latest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME 2020). Further observations are

users' historical sessions. As a result, these GNNs have difficulty
recommending items that users have never interacted with (new items), which
leads to a phenomenon of information cocoon. Therefore, it is necessary to
recommend new items to users. As there is no interaction between new items and
users, we cannot include new items when building session graphs for GNN
session-based recommender systems. Thus, it is challenging to recommend new
items for users when using GNN-based methods. We regard this challenge as
'\textbf{G}NN \textbf{S}ession-based \textbf{N}ew \textbf{I}tem

dual-intent enhanced graph neural network for it. Due to the fact that new
items are not tied to historical sessions, the users' intent is difficult to
predict. We design a dual-intent network to learn user intent from an attention
mechanism and the distribution of historical data respectively, which can
simulate users' decision-making process in interacting with a new item. To
solve the challenge that new items cannot be learned by GNNs, inspired by
zero-shot learning (ZSL), we infer the new item representation in GNN space by
using their attributes. By outputting new item probabilities, which contain
recommendation scores of the corresponding items, the new items with higher
scores are recommended to users. Experiments on two representative real-world

significant because it is closely connected to the regularity problem of weak

measure that has appeared in a variety of contexts in prior work on quantum

Here we provide a comprehensive study of this quantity. First we prove that it
satisfies several basic properties, including the data-processing inequality.
We also establish connections between the fidelity-based smooth min-relative
entropy and other widely used information-theoretic quantities, including
smooth min-relative entropy and smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy, of
which the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and smooth max-relative entropy
are special cases. After that, we use these connections to establish the
second-order asymptotics of the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and
all smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies, finding that the first-order
term is the quantum relative entropy and the second-order term involves the
quantum relative entropy variance. Utilizing the properties derived, we also
show how the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy provides one-shot
bounds for operational tasks in general resource theories in which the target
state is mixed, with a particular example being randomness distillation. The
above observations then lead to second-order expansions of the upper bounds on
distillable randomness, as well as the precise second-order asymptotics of the
distillable randomness of particular classical-quantum states. Finally, we
establish semi-definite programs for smooth max-relative entropy and smooth
conditional min-entropy, as well as a bilinear program for the fidelity-based
smooth min-relative entropy, which we subsequently use to explore the tightness
of a bound relating the last to the first.

underlying infrastructures and support their functions are only pairwise-based;
a strong assumption likely leading to oversimplifications. Indeed, most
interdependent systems intrinsically involve higher-order intra- and

among groups within and in-between species, collaborations and citations link
teams of coauthors to articles and vice versa, interactions might exist among
groups of friends from different social networks, etc. While higher-order

simplicial complexes and hypergraphs, a broad and systematic formalism
incorporating them into the realm of multilayer systems is still lacking. Here,
we introduce the concept of crossimplicial multicomplexes as a general

correction tasks from optical design to postprocessing systems. However,
without engaging with the optical parameters, these systems only achieve
limited correction for aberrations.In this work, we propose a practical method

design a spatial-adaptive network model on synthetic data pairs generated by

comprehensively evaluate the proposed method in simulations and experimentally

membership inference and model inversion can be used to uncover some
information about an unknown model, they still require knowledge of the data
domain to start with. In this paper, we propose solving this problem by
leveraging on comprehensive corpus such as ImageNet to select a meaningful
distribution that is close to the original training distribution and leads to
high performance in follow-up investigations. The corpus comprises two
components, a large dataset of samples and meta information such as
hierarchical structure and textual information on the samples. Our goal is to
select a set of samples from the corpus for the given model. The core of our
method is an objective function that considers two criteria on the selected
samples: the model functional properties (derived from the dataset), and
semantics (derived from the metadata). We also give an algorithm to efficiently
search the large space of all possible subsets w.r.t. the objective function.
Experimentation results show that the proposed method is effective. For
example, cloning a given model (originally trained with CIFAR-10) by using
Caltech 101 can achieve 45.5% accuracy. By using datasets selected by our

classification and semantic segmentation of medical images in the last year.
Due to the high similarity of human tissues, even slight changes in medical
images may represent diseased tissues, necessitating fine-grained inspection to
pinpoint diseased tissues. The random masking strategy of MAEs is likely to
result in areas of lesions being overlooked by the model. At the same time,
inconsistencies between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases impede the
performance and efficiency of MAE in medical image classification. To address
these issues, we propose a medical supervised masked autoencoder (MSMAE) in
this paper. In the pre-training phase, MSMAE precisely masks medical images via
the attention maps obtained from supervised training, contributing to the
representation learning of human tissue in the lesion area. During the
fine-tuning phase, MSMAE is also driven by attention to the accurate masking of
medical images. This improves the computational efficiency of the MSMAE while
increasing the difficulty of fine-tuning, which indirectly improves the quality
of MSMAE medical diagnosis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSMAE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in case with three official medical
datasets for various diseases. Meanwhile, transfer learning for MSMAE also
demonstrates the great potential of our approach for medical semantic
segmentation tasks. Moreover, the MSMAE accelerates the inference time in the
fine-tuning phase by 11.2% and reduces the number of floating-point operations

layers, to learn to estimate oriented normals from point clouds in an
end-to-end manner. The signed hyper surfaces are implicitly learned in a
high-dimensional feature space where the local and global information is

issues. This paper proposes the Quantization Aware Attack to enhance the attack
transferability by making the substitute model ``aware of'' the target of

post-training quantization method for super-resolution networks. Our motivation
for developing DFSQ is based on the distinctive activation distributions of
current super-resolution models, which exhibit significant variance across
samples and channels. To address this issue, DFSQ conducts channel-wise
normalization of the activations and applies distribution-flexible subset
quantization (SQ), wherein the quantization points are selected from a
universal set consisting of multi-word additive log-scale values. To expedite
the selection of quantization points in SQ, we propose a fast quantization
points selection strategy that uses K-means clustering to select the
quantization points closest to the centroids. Compared to the common iterative
exhaustive search algorithm, our strategy avoids the enumeration of all
possible combinations in the universal set, reducing the time complexity from
exponential to linear. Consequently, the constraint of time costs on the size
of the universal set is greatly relaxed. Extensive evaluations of various
super-resolution models show that DFSQ effectively retains performance even
without fine-tuning. For example, when quantizing EDSRx2 on the Urban
benchmark, DFSQ achieves comparable performance to full-precision counterparts
on 6- and 8-bit quantization, and incurs only a 0.1 dB PSNR drop on 4-bit

psychology theory, we propose a biologically plausible mixture of personality
(MoP) improved spiking actor network (SAN), whereby a determinantal point
process is used to simulate the complex formation and integration of different
types of personality in MoP, and dynamic and spiking neurons are incorporated
into the SAN for the efficient reinforcement learning. The benchmark Overcooked
task, containing a strong requirement for cooperative cooking, is selected to
test the proposed MoP-SAN. The experimental results show that the MoP-SAN can
achieve both high performances during not only the learning paradigm but also
the generalization test (i.e., cooperation with other unseen agents) paradigm
where most counterpart deep actor networks failed. Necessary ablation
experiments and visualization analyses were conducted to explain why MoP and
SAN are effective in multi-agent reinforcement learning scenarios while DNN
performs poorly in the generalization test.

privacy leakage, has become a well-accepted standard for privacy protection.
Combined with powerful machine learning techniques, differentially private
machine learning (DPML) is increasingly important. As the most classic DPML
algorithm, DP-SGD incurs a significant loss of utility, which hinders DPML's
deployment in practice. Many studies have recently proposed improved algorithms
based on DP-SGD to mitigate utility loss. However, these studies are isolated
and cannot comprehensively measure the performance of improvements proposed in
algorithms. More importantly, there is a lack of comprehensive research to
compare improvements in these DPML algorithms across utility, defensive
capabilities, and generalizability.
  We fill this gap by performing a holistic measurement of improved DPML
algorithms on utility and defense capability against membership inference
attacks (MIAs) on image classification tasks. We first present a taxonomy of
where improvements are located in the machine learning life cycle. Based on our
taxonomy, we jointly perform an extensive measurement study of the improved
DPML algorithms. We also cover state-of-the-art label differential privacy
(Label DP) algorithms in the evaluation. According to our empirical results, DP
can effectively defend against MIAs, and sensitivity-bounding techniques such
as per-sample gradient clipping play an important role in defense. We also
explore some improvements that can maintain model utility and defend against
MIAs more effectively. Experiments show that Label DP algorithms achieve less
utility loss but are fragile to MIAs. To support our evaluation, we implement a
modular re-usable software, DPMLBench, which enables sensitive data owners to
deploy DPML algorithms and serves as a benchmark tool for researchers and

ego-system coordination effect, and a novel diversity regularizer based on
sparse action is applied to diversify the behaviors among attackers. The
ego-system is then paired with a population of attackers selected from the

ignoring the fact that teammates may suffer from policy change suddenly within
an episode, which might lead to miscoordination and poor performance as a
result. We formulate the problem as an open Dec-POMDP, where we control some
agents to coordinate with uncontrolled teammates, whose policies could be
changed within one episode. Then we develop a new framework, fast teammates
adaptation (Fastap), to address the problem. Concretely, we first train
versatile teammates' policies and assign them to different clusters via the
Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP). Then, we train the controlled agent(s) to
coordinate with the sampled uncontrolled teammates by capturing their
identifications as context for fast adaptation. Finally, each agent applies its
local information to anticipate the teammates' context for decision-making
accordingly. This process proceeds alternately, leading to a robust policy that
can adapt to any teammates during the decentralized execution phase. We show in
multiple multi-agent benchmarks that Fastap can achieve superior performance

For each temporal step, the multi-scale solver uses the macroscopic solver when
the firing rate of the simulated network is low, while it switches to the
microscopic solver when the firing rate tends to blow up. Moreover, the
macroscopic and microscopic solvers are integrated with a high-precision

to support multi-user access. Based on the round-trip multi-band quantum access
network, we realize multi-user secure key sharing through the
continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) protocol. Due to the encoding characteristics
of CV-QKD, the quadrature components in different frequency bands can be used
to transmit key information for different users. The feasibility of this scheme
is confirmed by comprehensive noise analysis, and is verified by a
proof-of-principle experiment. The results show that each user can achieve
excess noise suppression and 600 bps level secure key generation under 30 km
standard fiber transmission. Such networks have the ability of multi-user
access theoretically and could be expanded by plugging in simple modules.
Therefore, it paves the way for near-term large-scale quantum secure networks.

autoregressive pattern of LLM inference to enable preemption at the granularity
of each output token. FastServe uses preemptive scheduling to minimize JCT with
a novel skip-join Multi-Level Feedback Queue scheduler. Based on the new semi
information-agnostic setting of LLM inference, the scheduler leverages the
input length information to assign an appropriate initial queue for each
arrival job to join. The higher priority queues than the joined queue are
skipped to reduce demotions. We design an efficient GPU memory management
mechanism that proactively offloads and uploads intermediate states between GPU
memory and host memory for LLM inference. We build a system prototype of
FastServe based on NVIDIA FasterTransformer. Experimental results show that
compared to the state-of-the-art solution Orca, FastServe improves the average

the best performance with an AUC of 0.856 and AP of 0.431; slightly
outperforming the deep learning approach without attention (AUC=0.832, AP= 0.4)

remains unknown. This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning
models to predict the progression of PFOA using imaging and clinical variables.
These models could be used to identify patients who are at high risk of
progression and prioritize them for new treatments. However, even though the

they should be still validated using external patient cohorts in the future.

guarantees security with arbitrarily flawed receivers, the missing step is
securing the sources. So far, all efforts in this regard have come at a price;
some proofs are suitable only for particular source imperfections, while others
severely compromise the system's performance, i.e., its communication speed and
distance. Meanwhile, device-independent QKD is far from being a satisfactory
solution, as it is vulnerable to memory attacks, it cannot incorporate
information leakage from the user devices in a device-independent manner, and
its performance is poor. Here, we solve this crucial problem by presenting a
security proof that is robust against all practical source imperfections while
maintaining high performance. Moreover, our proof requires minimal state
characterization, which facilitates its application to real-life
implementations. We anticipate that, thanks to these advantages, it will serve

embedded in a dynamic star-forming cloud is post-processed using sequentially
continuum radiative transfer, a gas-grain chemical model, and a line-radiative
transfer model. Results are analyzed and compared to observations of CH$_3$OH
and $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ in L1544. Nine different chemical models are compared to the
observations to determine which initial conditions are compatible with the
observed chemical segregation in the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. The
model is able to reproduce several aspects of the observed chemical
differentiation in L1544. Extended methanol emission is shifted towards colder
and more shielded regions of the core envelope while $c$-C$_3$H$_2$ emission
overlaps with the dust continuum, consistent with the observed chemical
structure. Increasing the strength of the interstellar radiation field or the
cosmic-ray ionization rate with respect to the typical values assumed in nearby
star-forming regions leads to synthetic maps that are inconsistent with the
observed chemical structure. Our model shows that the observed chemical
dichotomy in L1544 can arise as a result of uneven illumination due to the
asymmetrical structure of the 3D core and the environment within which the core
has formed. This highlights the importance of the 3D structure at the

artificial intelligence from distributed mobile data. However, the deployment
of FL in mobile networks can be compromised by exposure to interference from
neighboring cells or jammers. Existing interference mitigation techniques
require multi-cell cooperation or at least interference channel state
information, which is expensive in practice. On the other hand, power control
that treats interference as noise may not be effective due to limited power
budgets, and also that this mechanism can trigger countermeasures by
interference sources. As a practical approach for protecting FL against
interference, we propose Spectrum Breathing, which cascades stochastic-gradient
pruning and spread spectrum to suppress interference without bandwidth
expansion. The cost is higher learning latency by exploiting the graceful
degradation of learning speed due to pruning. We synchronize the two operations
such that their levels are controlled by the same parameter, Breathing Depth.
To optimally control the parameter, we develop a martingale-based approach to
convergence analysis of Over-the-Air FL with spectrum breathing, termed
AirBreathing FL. We show a performance tradeoff between gradient-pruning and
interference-induced error as regulated by the breathing depth. Given receive
SIR and model size, the optimization of the tradeoff yields two schemes for
controlling the breathing depth that can be either fixed or adaptive to
channels and the learning process. As shown by experiments, in scenarios where
traditional Over-the-Air FL fails to converge in the presence of strong
interference, AirBreahing FL with either fixed or adaptive breathing depth can
ensure convergence where the adaptive scheme achieves close-to-ideal
performance.

preservation property for the PC estimators of loadings, which comes from the
approximately upper triangular (block) structure of the rotation matrix. It
implies an asymmetric relationship among factors: the rotated loadings for a
stronger factor can be contaminated by those from a weaker one, but the
loadings for a weaker factor is almost free of the impact of those from a
stronger one. More importantly, the finding implies that there is no need to
use complicated penalties to sparsify the loading estimators. Instead, we adopt
a simple screening method to recover the sparsity and construct estimators for
various factor strengths. In addition, for sparse weak factor models, we
provide a singular value thresholding-based approach to determine the number of
factors and establish uniform convergence rates for PC estimators, which
complement Bai and Ng (2023). The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed

been observed experimentally for liquids with sufficiently small viscosity
leading to comparably small viscous dissipation. Back in 1999, Quere et al.
formulated a condition for the appearance of rise height oscillations for an
ODE model introduced by Bosanquet in 1923. This model has later been extended
to include further dissipative mechanisms. In this work, we extend the
mathematical analysis to a larger class of models including additional channels
of dissipation. We show that Quere's critical condition is generalized to
$\Omega + \beta < 2$, where $\Omega$ was introduced earlier and $\beta$ is an
additional non-dimensional parameter describing, e.g., contact line friction. A
quantitative prediction of the oscillation dynamics is achieved from a
linearization of the governing equations. We apply the theory to experimental
data by Quere et al. and, in particular, reveal the oscillatory behavior of
dynamics for the nearly critically damped case of ethanol.

toward bypassing recurrent annotation costs in a low-resource setting. Yet,
only a handful of past studies have explored ICL in a cross-lingual setting, in
which the need for transferring label-knowledge from a high-resource language
to a low-resource one is immensely crucial. To bridge the gap, we provide the
first in-depth analysis of ICL for cross-lingual text classification. We find
that the prevalent mode of selecting random input-label pairs to construct the
prompt-context is severely limited in the case of cross-lingual ICL, primarily
due to the lack of alignment in the input as well as the output spaces. To
mitigate this, we propose a novel prompt construction strategy -- Cross-lingual
In-context Source-Target Alignment (X-InSTA). With an injected coherence in the
semantics of the input examples and a task-based alignment across the source

a large margin across three different tasks using 44 different cross-lingual

extensive research interest in developing Deepfake detection methods. Deepfake
manipulations typically involve tampering with facial parts, which can result
in inconsistencies across different parts of the face. For instance, Deepfake
techniques may change smiling lips to an upset lip, while the eyes remain
smiling. Existing detection methods depend on specific indicators of forgery,
which tend to disappear as the forgery patterns are improved. To address the
limitation, we propose Mover, a new Deepfake detection model that exploits
unspecific facial part inconsistencies, which are inevitable weaknesses of
Deepfake videos. Mover randomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and recovers
faces to learn unspecific features, which makes it difficult for fake faces to
be recovered, while real faces can be easily recovered. Specifically, given a
real face image, we first pretrain a masked autoencoder to learn facial part
consistency by dividing faces into three parts and randomly masking ROIs, which
are then recovered based on the unmasked facial parts. Furthermore, to maximize
the discrepancy between real and fake videos, we propose a novel model with
dual networks that utilize the pretrained encoder and masked autoencoder,
respectively. 1) The pretrained encoder is finetuned for capturing the encoding
of inconsistent information in the given video. 2) The pretrained masked
autoencoder is utilized for mapping faces and distinguishing real and fake
videos. Our extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Mover
is highly effective.

While PTAs may detect a stochastic gravitational-wave background from a

MBHBs. To demonstrate the profound interplay between LISA and PTAs, we estimate
the number of MBHB mergers that one can expect to observe with LISA by
extrapolating direct observational constraints on the MBHB merger rate inferred
from PTA data. For this, we postulate that the common noise currently detected
in PTAs is an astrophysical background sourced by a single MBHB population. We
then constrain the LISA detection rate, $\mathcal{R}$, in the mass-redshift
space by combining our Bayesian-inferred merger rate with LISA's sensitivity to
spin-aligned, inspiral-merger-ringdown waveforms. Using an
astrophysically-informed formation model, we predict a 95$\%$ upper limit on

mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problem incorporating access point (AP)

the low-complexity but efficient heuristic methods thereby relaxing the binary

optimizing the assignment of subcarrier sets and the number of AP clusters.
Furthermore, an advanced MDD frame structure consisting of three parallel data
streams is tailored for the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed dynamic AP clustering approach in dealing with
the varying sizes of networks. Moreover, benefiting from the well-designed
frame structure, MDD is capable of outperforming TDD in the two-tier fronthaul

code intelligence techniques. This survey focuses on code search, that is, to
retrieve code that matches a given query by effectively capturing the semantic
similarity between the query and code. Deep learning, being able to extract
complex semantics information, has achieved great success in this field.
Recently, various deep learning methods, such as graph neural networks and
pretraining models, have been applied to code search with significant progress.
Deep learning is now the leading paradigm for code search. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning-based code search. We review
the existing deep learning-based code search framework which maps query/code to
vectors and measures their similarity. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy
to illustrate the state-of-the-art deep learning-based code search in a
three-steps process: query semantics modeling, code semantics modeling, and
matching modeling which involves the deep learning model training. Finally, we
suggest potential avenues for future research in this promising field.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the factors that influence user

users' behavioral intention. An online study that employed factorial survey
design with vignettes was conducted, and a total of 1,669 participants from
eight countries across four continents were included in the study. Structural
equation modeling was employed to quantitatively assess how various factors
collectively contribute to users' willingness to use mHealth apps. The results
indicate that users' digital literacy has the strongest impact on their
willingness to use them, followed by their online habit of sharing personal
information. Users' concerns about personal privacy only had a weak impact.
Furthermore, users' demographic background, such as their country of residence,
age, ethnicity, and education, has a significant moderating effect. Our
findings have implications for app designers, healthcare practitioners, and
policymakers. Efforts are needed to regulate data collection and sharing and
promote digital literacy among the general population to facilitate the
widespread adoption of mHealth apps.

(FPCA) problem. We start with the max-min fair PCA formulation originally
proposed in [1] and derive a simple and efficient iterative algorithm which is
based on the minorization-maximization (MM) approach. The proposed algorithm
relies on the relaxation of a semi-orthogonality constraint which is proved to
be tight at every iteration of the algorithm. The vanilla version of the
proposed algorithm requires solving a semi-definite program (SDP) at every
iteration, which can be further simplified to a quadratic program by
formulating the dual of the surrogate maximization problem. We also propose two
important reformulations of the fair PCA problem: a) fair robust PCA -- which
can handle outliers in the data, and b) fair sparse PCA -- which can enforce
sparsity on the estimated fair principal components. The proposed algorithms
are computationally efficient and monotonically increase their respective
design objectives at every iteration. An added feature of the proposed
algorithms is that they do not require the selection of any hyperparameter
(except for the fair sparse PCA case where a penalty parameter that controls
the sparsity has to be chosen by the user). We numerically compare the
performance of the proposed methods with two of the state-of-the-art approaches

Given the embedding produced by a backbone method, the probe units assess the

instrumental in identifying missing information, as a step to its recovery. The
recovery of the degraded components along with the fusion guidance are embedded
in the booster layer. Lastly, the assembling module is responsible for piecing

reconstruction loss functions and lightweight models to formulate the network,
with marginal computational increase. The experimental results obtained in

address this, one of which uses coded computation to lighten the load. Here we
seek to address one issue with all such coded blockchain schemes known to the

access to the uncoded block, while the nodes receive encoded data that makes it
effectively impossible for them to identify which transactions were included in
the block. As a result, a Byzantine leader might choose not to notify a sender
or receiver of a transaction that the transaction went into the block, and even
with an honest leader, they would not be able to produce a proof of a

send the nodes enough information so that a client sending or receiving a
transaction is guaranteed to not only be notified but also to receive a proof
of that transaction's inclusion in the block. Crucially, we do this without
substantially increasing the bit complexity of the original coded blockchain

on a 5-cycle without changing colors outside the 5-cycle. On the other hand, as
our colorings of the superpositioned snarks introduce 18 or more poor edges, we
are inclined to believe that every bridgeless cubic graph istinct from P10 has
a normal coloring with at least one poor edge and possibly with at least 6 if
we also exclude the Petersen graph with one vertex truncated.

  multi-stage approach using large language models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A medical provider's summary of a patient visit serves several critical
purposes, including clinical decision-making, facilitating hand-offs between
providers, and as a reference for the patient. An effective summary is required
to be coherent and accurately capture all the medically relevant information in
the dialogue, despite the complexity of patient-generated language. Even minor
inaccuracies in visit summaries (for example, summarizing ""patient does not
have a fever"" when a fever is present) can be detrimental to the outcome of
care for the patient.
  This paper tackles the problem of medical conversation summarization by
discretizing the task into several smaller dialogue-understanding tasks that
are sequentially built upon. First, we identify medical entities and their
affirmations within the conversation to serve as building blocks. We study
dynamically constructing few-shot prompts for tasks by conditioning on relevant
patient information and use GPT-3 as the backbone for our experiments. We also
develop GPT-derived summarization metrics to measure performance against
reference summaries quantitatively. Both our human evaluation study and metrics
for medical correctness show that summaries generated using this approach are
clinically accurate and outperform the baseline approach of summarizing the
dialog in a zero-shot, single-prompt setting.

learning the so-called Granger causality which assumes that the cause event
happens strictly prior to its effect event. Such an assumption is often
untenable beyond applications, especially when dealing with discrete-time event
sequences in low-resolution; and typical discrete Hawkes processes mainly
suffer from identifiability issues raised by the instantaneous effect, i.e.,
the causal relationship that occurred simultaneously due to the low-resolution

Structure Hawkes Processes (SHPs) that leverage the instantaneous effect for
learning the causal structure among events type in discrete-time event

the likelihood function and a sparse optimization scheme. Theoretical results
show that the instantaneous effect is a blessing rather than a curse, and the
causal structure is identifiable under the existence of the instantaneous
effect. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data verify the effectiveness

thus outwardly contradicting the Copernican Principle. Hence, we elucidate
three avenues whereby the Copernican Principle can be preserved: (i) the
emergence rate of TIs is much lower in OBHs, (ii) the habitability interval for
TIs is much shorter in OBHs, and (iii) only a small fraction of worlds with

However, usually screen content images not only consist of synthetic but also

supplements a compression method known as Soft Context Formation (SCF) and
operates as a pre-processing step. If at least one natural segment is found

a major challenge. Conventional methods, such as finite difference methods, are
unable to solve high-dimensional PDEs due to the curse-of-dimensionality. A
variety of deep learning methods have been recently developed to try and solve
high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution using a neural network. In
this paper, we prove global convergence for one of the commonly-used deep
learning algorithms for solving PDEs, the Deep Galerkin Method (DGM). DGM
trains a neural network approximator to solve the PDE using stochastic gradient
descent. We prove that, as the number of hidden units in the single-layer
network goes to infinity (i.e., in the ``wide network limit""), the trained
neural network converges to the solution of an infinite-dimensional linear
ordinary differential equation (ODE). The PDE residual of the limiting
approximator converges to zero as the training time $\rightarrow \infty$. Under
mild assumptions, this convergence also implies that the neural network
approximator converges to the solution of the PDE. A closely related class of
deep learning methods for PDEs is Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
Using the same mathematical techniques, we can prove a similar global
convergence result for the PINN neural network approximators. Both proofs
require analyzing a kernel function in the limit ODE governing the evolution of
the limit neural network approximator. A key technical challenge is that the
kernel function, which is a composition of the PDE operator and the neural
tangent kernel (NTK) operator, lacks a spectral gap, therefore requiring a
careful analysis of its properties.

environment (obstacle and landmark location) uncertainties. To this end, we
first develop an approach that accounts for the landmark uncertainties during
robot localization. Existing planning approaches assume that the landmark
locations are well known or are known with little uncertainty. However, this
might not be true in practice. Noisy sensors and imperfect motions compound to
the errors originating from the estimate of environment features. Moreover,
possible occlusions and dynamic objects in the environment render imperfect
landmark estimation. Consequently, not considering this uncertainty can wrongly
localize the robot, leading to inefficient plans. Our approach thus
incorporates the landmark uncertainty within the Bayes filter estimation
framework. We also analyze the effect of considering this uncertainty and
delineate the conditions under which it can be ignored. Second, we extend the
state-of-the-art by computing an exact expression for the collision probability
under Gaussian distributed robot motion, perception and obstacle location
uncertainties. We formulate the collision probability process as a quadratic
form in random variables. Under Gaussian distribution assumptions, an exact
expression for collision probability is thus obtained which is computable in
real-time. In contrast, existing approaches approximate the collision
probability using upper-bounds that can lead to overly conservative estimate
and thereby suboptimal plans. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach using a
theoretical example and simulations. We also present a comparison of our
approach to different state-of-the-art methods.

reaction networks (CRNs) and gene-regulatory networks (GRNs) has been
introduced in the literature, because cells use these concepts to perform

stochastic fluctuations of chemical reactions and long computation times in
GRNs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose two receiver designs based on
stochastic CRNs, i.e., CRNs that perform computations by exploiting the
intrinsic fluctuations of chemical reactions with very low molecule counts. The
first CRN builds on a recent result from chemistry that showed how Boltzmann
machines (BMs), a commonly used machine learning model, can be implemented with
CRNs. We show that BMs with optimal parameter values and their CRN
implementations can act as maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) detectors. Furthermore,
we show that BMs can be efficiently trained from simulation data to achieve
close-to-MAP performance. While this approach yields a fixed CRN once deployed,
our second approach based on a manually designed CRN can be trained with pilot
symbols even within the cell and thus adapt to changing channel conditions. We
extend the literature by showing that practical robust detectors can achieve
close-to-MAP performance even without explicit channel knowledge.

due to different spatial arrangements of the atoms in the two enantiomers. A
common way to optically differentiate them is to detect the disparity in the
absorption of light by the two enantiomers, i.e. the absorption circular
dichroism (CD). However, the CD of typical molecules is very small, limiting
the sensitivity of chiroptical analysis based on CD. Cavity ring-down
spectroscopy (CRDS) is a well-known ultrasensitive absorption spectroscopic
method for low-absorbing gas-phase samples because the multiple reflections of
light in the cavity greatly increase the absorption path. By inserting a prism
into the cavity, the optical mode undergoes total internal reflection (TIR) at
the prism surface and the evanescent wave (EW) enables the absorption detection
of condensed-phase samples within a very thin layer near the prism surface,
called EW-CRDS. Here, we propose an ultrasensitive chiral absorption
spectroscopy platform using a dielectric metasurface-assisted EW-CRDS. We
theoretically show that, upon linearly polarized and oblique incidence, the
metasurface exhibits minimum scattering and absorption loss, introduces
negligible polarization change, and locally converts the linearly polarized
light into near fields with finite optical chirality, enabling CD detection
with EW-CRDS that only works with linearly polarized light. We evaluate the
ring-down time in the presence of chiral molecules and determine the
sensitivity of the cavity as a function of total absorption from the molecules.
The findings open the avenue for an ultrasensitive thin film detection of the
chiral molecules using the CRDS techniques.

However, we need to distinguish cavities created by photoevaporation from those
created by giant planets. Theoretical models are necessary to identify possible
observational signatures of the two different processes, and models to find the
differences between the two processes are still lacking. In this paper we study
a sample of transition discs obtained from radiation-hydrodynamic simulations
of internally photoevaporated discs, and focus on the dust dynamics relevant
for current ALMA observations. We then compared our results with gaps opened by
super Earths/giant planets, finding that the photoevaporated cavity steepness
depends mildly on gap size, and it is similar to that of a 1 Jupiter mass
planet. However, the dust density drops less rapidly inside the photoevaporated
cavity compared to the planetary case due to the less efficient dust filtering.
This effect is visible in the resulting spectral index, which shows a larger
spectral index at the cavity edge and a shallower increase inside it with

nonlinear system, this paper proposes a self-contained solution for
time-sharing orbit jump and energy harvesting. The joint dynamics of an
electromechanical assembly consisting of a nonlinear energy harvester and a
switch-mode piezoelectric interface circuit is studied for high-capability
energy harvesting. The proposed solution is carried out by utilizing a
cutting-edge switch-mode bidirectional energy conversion circuit (BECC), which
enables time-sharing dual functions of energy harvesting and vibration
exciting. A theoretical model is established based on impedance analysis and
multiple time scales method to analyze the stability, frequency response, and
phase evolution of the autonomous and nonautonomous nonlinear energy harvesting
systems. Particularly, the detailed dynamics for the orbit jumps with vibration
exciting mode of BECC are studied. Experiments are performed to validate the
full-range orbit jumps with the monostable nonlinear energy harvester. The
harvested power after orbit jumps yields a nine-fold increase, compensating for
the energy consumption under vibration exciting mode quickly. The proposed
solution also refrains the system from extra mechanical or electrical energy

robustness to common corruptions that can occur when deploying computer vision
models to work in practical applications. We describe different types of image
corruption and provide the definition of corruption robustness. We then
introduce relevant evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets. We categorize
methods into four groups. We also cover indirect methods that show improvements
in generalization and may improve corruption robustness as a byproduct. We
report benchmark results collected from the literature and find that they are
not evaluated in a unified manner, making it difficult to compare and analyze.
We thus built a unified benchmark framework to obtain directly comparable
results on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate relevant backbone
networks pre-trained on ImageNet using our framework, providing an overview of
the base corruption robustness of existing models to help choose appropriate
backbones for computer vision tasks. We identify that developing methods to
handle a wide range of corruptions and efficiently learn with limited data and
computational resources is crucial for future development. Additionally, we
highlight the need for further investigation into the relationship among
corruption robustness, OOD generalization, and shortcut learning.

via radiation pressure acceleration (RPA) when the foil thickness is matched
with the laser intensity, e.g., $L_{mat}$ at several nm to 100 nm with
$10^{19}-10^{22} \rm ~W cm^{-2}$ available in laboratory. However,
non-monoenergetic protons with much lower energies than prediction were usually
observed in RPA experiments, because of too small foil thickness which is hard
to bear insufficient laser contrast and foil surface roughness. Besides the
technical problems, we here find that there is an upper-limit thickness
$L_{up}$ derived from the requirement that the laser energy density should
dominate over the ion source, and $L_{up}$ is lower than $ L_{mat}$ with the
intensity below $10^{22} \rm~ W cm^{-2}$, which causes inefficient or unsteady
RPA. As the intensity is enhanced to $\geq 10^{23} \rm ~W cm^{-2}$ provided by
10-100 PW laser facilities, $L_{up}$ can significantly exceed $L_{mat}$ and
therefore RPA becomes efficient. In this regime, $L_{mat}$ acts as a
lower-limit thickness for efficient RPA, so the matching thickness can be
extended to a continuous range from $L_{mat}$ to $L_{up}$; the range can reach
micrometers, within which foil thickness is adjustable. This makes RPA steady
and meanwhile the above technical problems can be overcome. Particle-in-cell
simulation shows that multi-GeV quasi-monoenergetic proton beams can be
steadily generated and the fluctuation of the energy peaks and the energy
conversation efficiency remains stable although the thickness is taken in a
larger range with increasing intensity. This work predicts that near future RPA
experiments with 10-100 PW facilities will enter a new regime with the
adjustable and large-range foil thickness for steady acceleration.

aspect of TES physics that has not been investigated is the sensitivity of TESs
to strong DC electric fields (10 kV/m and above). Understanding the resilience
of TESs to DC electric fields is essential when considering their use as
charged particle spectrometers, a field in which TESs could have an enormous
impact. Techniques such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy produce a high
number of low-energy electrons that are not of interest and can be screened
from the detector using electrostatic deflection. The use of strong electric
fields could also provide a mass-efficient route to prevent secondary electron
measurements arising from cosmic radiation in space-based TES applications.
Integrating electron optics into the TES membrane provides an elegant and
compact means to control the interaction between charged particles and the
sensor, whether by screening unwanted particles or enhancing the particle
absorption efficiency but implementing such techniques requires understanding
the sensitivity of the TES to the resulting electric fields. In this work, we
applied a uniform DC electric field across a Mo/Au TES using a parallel pair of
flat electrodes positioned above and below the TES. The electric field in the
vicinity of the TES was enhanced by the presence of silicon backing plate
directly beneath the TES. Using this arrangement, we were able to apply of
electric fields up to 90 kV/m across the TES. We observed no electric field
sensitivity at any field strength demonstrating the capability to use TESs in

of the heliospheric magnetic field. Observations from Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
have shown that they are a prevalent feature of the near-Sun solar wind.
However, observations of switchbacks at 1 au and beyond are less frequent,
suggesting that these structures evolve and potentially erode through yet-to-be
identified mechanisms as they propagate away from the Sun. We analyse magnetic
field and plasma data from the Magnetometer and Solar Wind Analyser instruments
aboard Solar Orbiter between 10 August and 30 August 2021. During this period,
the spacecraft was 0.6 to 0.7 au from the Sun. We identify three instances of
reconnection occurring at the trailing edge of magnetic switchbacks, with
properties consistent with existing models describing reconnection in the solar
wind. Using hodographs and Walen analysis methods, we test for rotational
discontinuities (RDs) in the magnetic field and reconnection-associated
outflows at the boundaries of the identified switchback structures. Based on
these observations, we propose a scenario through which reconnection can erode
a switchback and we estimate the timescales over which this occurs. For our
events, the erosion timescales are much shorter than the expansion timescale
and thus, the complete erosion of all three observed switchbacks would occur
well before they reach 1 au. Furthermore, we find that the spatial scale of
these switchbacks would be considerably larger than is typically observed in
the inner heliosphere if the onset of reconnection occurs close to the Sun.
Hence, our results suggest that the onset of reconnection must occur during
transport in the solar wind in our cases. These results suggest that
reconnection can contribute to the erosion of switchbacks and may explain the
relative rarity of switchback observations at 1 au.

  spacetime I: the case of de Sitter spacetime","45 pages, 5 figures, any comments are most welcome",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Before we ask what is the theory of quantum gravity, it is a legitimate quest
to formulate a robust quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS). Several
conceptual problems have raised concerns over several decades, mainly because
no S-matrix formulation is yet found in QFTCS. We argue that the institutional
thinking of fixing a spacetime geometry, observers, light-cones and then
quantizing the fields in that ""intuitively"", or ""classically"", fixed spacetime
is the origin of the problem. In this paper, acknowledging the fact that ""time""
is a parameter in quantum theory, which is different from its status in the
context of General Relativity (GR), we start with a ""quantum first approach""
and propose new formulation for QFTCS based on the discrete spacetime
transformations ($\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$). Our framework for a
QFTCS is built on a refined understanding of standard QFT S-matrix that
explicitly reflects the $\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$ invariance of
scattering amplitudes. We rewrite the standard QFT equipped with a direct-sum
Fock space structure, that is explicitly $\mathcal{C}\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$
invariant. Applying this framework to QFTCS, in the context of de Sitter (dS)
spacetime (in the flat FLRW coordinates), we elucidate how one can define a
consistent S-matrix that is analogous to the QFT S-matrix in Minkowski
spacetime. We discuss how this approach to quantization complies with the
observer complementarity principle. We also comment on extending our
quantization scheme to dS spacetime expressed in the closed FLRW coordinates.
Furthermore, we discuss briefly the implications of our QFTCS approach for
quantum gravity.

in various domains. Previous studies have demonstrated that such systems are
vulnerable to runaway feedback loops, e.g., when police are repeatedly sent
back to the same neighborhoods regardless of the actual rate of criminal
activity, which exacerbate existing biases. In practice, the automated
decisions have dynamic feedback effects on the system itself that can
perpetuate over time, making it difficult for short-sighted design choices to
control the system's evolution. While researchers started proposing longer-term
solutions to prevent adverse outcomes (such as bias towards certain groups),
these interventions largely depend on ad hoc modeling assumptions and a
rigorous theoretical understanding of the feedback dynamics in ML-based
decision-making systems is currently missing. In this paper, we use the
language of dynamical systems theory, a branch of applied mathematics that
deals with the analysis of the interconnection of systems with dynamic
behaviors, to rigorously classify the different types of feedback loops in the
ML-based decision-making pipeline. By reviewing existing scholarly work, we
show that this classification covers many examples discussed in the algorithmic
fairness community, thereby providing a unifying and principled framework to
study feedback loops. By qualitative analysis, and through a simulation example
of recommender systems, we show which specific types of ML biases are affected
by each type of feedback loop. We find that the existence of feedback loops in
the ML-based decision-making pipeline can perpetuate, reinforce, or even reduce
ML biases.

hinder FL from training an effective deep learning reconstruction model and

Furthermore, a personalized soft update scheme is designed to simultaneously

position of the treasure. The cost of the treasure hunt is defined as the total
distance traveled by the agent before it finds the treasure. The agent has no
prior knowledge of the position of the treasure or the value of $D$. An Oracle,
which knows the treasure's position and the agent's initial location, places
some pebbles to guide the agent towards the treasure. Once decided to move
along some specified angular direction, the agent can decide to change its
direction only when it encounters a pebble or a special point.
  We ask the following central question in this paper:
  ``For given $k \ge 0$, What is cheapest treasure hunt algorithm if at most
$k$ pebbles are placed by the Oracle?""
  We show that for $k=1$, there does not exist any treasure hunt algorithm that
finds the treasure with finite cost. We show the existence of an algorithm with
cost $O(D)$ for $k=2$. For $k>8$ we have designed an algorithm that uses $k$
many pebbles to find the treasure with cost $O(k^{2}) + D(\sin\theta' +
\cos\theta')$, where $\theta'=\frac{\pi}{2^{k-8}}$. The second result shows the
existence of an algorithm with cost arbitrarily close to $D$ for sufficiently
large values of $D$.

using a relation of the Vlasov equation chain with the Schr\""odinger equation
and with the Moyal equation for the Wigner function. A method of averaging the
energy function over the Wigner function in the phase space can be used to
obtain time-dependent energy spectrum for a quantum system. The Vlasov equation
solution can be represented in the form of characteristics satisfying the Hill
equation. A particular case of the Hill equation, namely the Mathieu equation
with unstable solutions, has been considered in details. An analysis of the
dynamics of an unstable quantum system shows that the phase space square
bounded with the Wigner function level line conserves in time, but the phase
space square bounded with the energy function line increases. In this case the
Vlasov equation characteristic is situated on the crosspoint of the Wigner
function level line and the energy function line. This crosspoint moves in time
with a trajectory that represents the unstable system dynamics. Each such
trajectory has its own energy, and averaging these energies over the Wigner
function results in time-dependent discreet energy spectrum for the whole
system. An explicit expression has been obtained for the Wigner function of the
4th rank in the generalized phase space $\left\{ x,p,\dot{p},\ddot{p}

myeloid leukemia (CML) patients on Medicare Part D to determine if high
out-of-pocket payments (OOP) are driving the substantial levels of
non-adherence observed in this population.
  Data sources and study setting We use data from the TriNetX Diamond Network
(TDN) United States database for the period from first availability in 2011
through the end of patent exclusivity following the introduction of generic
imatinib in early 2016.
  Study design We implement a fuzzy regression discontinuity design to
separately estimate the effect of Medicare Part D enrollment at age 65 on
adherence and OOP in newly-diagnosed CML patients initiating branded imatinib.
The corresponding price elasticity of demand (PED) is estimated and results are
assessed across a variety of specifications and robustness checks.
  Data collection/extraction methods Data from eligible patients following the
application of inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed.
  Principal findings Our analysis suggests that there is a significant increase
in initial OOP of $232 (95% Confidence interval (CI): $102 to $362) for
individuals that enrolled in Part D due to expanded eligibility at age 65. The
relatively smaller and non-significant decrease in adherence of only 6
percentage points (95% CI: -0.21 to 0.08) led to a PED of -0.02 (95% CI:
-0.056, 0.015).
  Conclusion This study provides evidence regarding the financial impact of
coinsurance-based benefit designs on Medicare-age patients with CML initiating
branded imatinib. Results indicate that factors besides high OOP are driving
the substantial non-adherence observed in this population and add to the
growing literature on PED for specialty drugs.

paper, we present the first approach to use diffusion models as a prior for
highly accurate 3D facial BRDF reconstruction from a single image. We start by
leveraging a high-quality UV dataset of facial reflectance (diffuse and
specular albedo and normals), which we render under varying illumination
settings to simulate natural RGB textures and, then, train an unconditional
diffusion model on concatenated pairs of rendered textures and reflectance
components. At test time, we fit a 3D morphable model to the given image and
unwrap the face in a partial UV texture. By sampling from the diffusion model,
while retaining the observed texture part intact, the model inpaints not only
the self-occluded areas but also the unknown reflectance components, in a
single sequence of denoising steps. In contrast to existing methods, we
directly acquire the observed texture from the input image, thus, resulting in
more faithful and consistent reflectance estimation. Through a series of
qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we demonstrate superior performance
in both texture completion as well as reflectance reconstruction tasks.

consequence, their emergent patterns in channel networks are out of reach of

basic laws of active hydraulics. We show that active hydraulic flows are
non-deterministic and yield degenerate streamline patterns ruled by frustration
at nodes with an odd coordination number. More precisely, colloidal-roller

topological defects at the subchannel scales. Informed by our measurements, we
formulate the laws of active hydraulics as a double spin model. A series of
mappings on loop O(n) models then allow us to exactly predict the geometry of

negative points often require large batches or momentum encoders, resulting in
unreliable similarity information and a high computational overhead. In this

the design of a simple framework termed PaPi (Partial-label learning with a

improvement in representation learning, thus contributing to label

linear classifier with which they share the same feature encoder, thus
explicitly encouraging the representation to reflect visual similarity between

components in PiCO with the opposite direction of guidance, and directly
eliminates the contrastive learning module that would introduce noise and
consume computational resources. We empirically demonstrate that PaPi

studies, especially for magnetic confinement fusion plasmas. The particle
distribution has a direct effect on fusion reactivity, which is the focus of
this study. We investigate the effects of three types of non-Maxwellian
distributions, namely drift-ring-beam, slowing-down, and kappa super-thermal
distributions, on the fusion reactivities of D-T (Deuterium-Trillium) and p-B11
(proton-Boron) using a newly developed program, where the enhancement of fusion
reactivity relative to the Maxwellian distribution is computed while keeping
the total kinetic energy constant. The calculation results show that for the
temperature ranges of interest to us, namely 5-50 keV for D-T and 100-500 keV
for p-B11, these non-Maxwellian distributions can enhance the fusion
reactivities. In the case of the drift-ring-beam distribution, the enhancement
factors for both reactions are affected by the perpendicular ring beam
velocity, leading to decreased enhancement in low temperature range and
increased enhancement in high temperature range. However, this effect is
favorable for p-B11 fusion reaction and unfavorable for D-T fusion reaction. In
the slowing-down distribution, the birth speed plays a crucial role in both
reactions, and increasing birth speed leads to a shift in the enhancement
ranges towards lower temperatures, which is beneficial for both reactions.
Finally, the kappa super-thermal distribution results in a relatively large
enhancement in the low temperature range with a small high energy power-law
index {\kappa}. Overall, this study provides insight into the effects of
non-Maxwellian distributions on fusion reactivity and highlights potential
opportunities for enhancing fusion efficiency.

GPT3.5/ChatGPT3.4 and ChatGPT4 at the current state and show that such a range

mode in each time slot. In particular, the user in the BackCom mode can always
use the signal transmitted by the user in the active mode for more data
transmission in a spectrum-sharing manner. To evaluate the proposed protocol, a
computation efficiency (CE) maximization-based optimization problem is
formulated by jointly power control, time scheduling, reflection coefficient
adjustment, and computing frequency allocation, while satisfying various
physical constraints on the maximum energy budget, the computing frequency
threshold, the minimum computed bits, and harvested energy threshold. To solve
this non-convex problem, Dinkelbach's method and quadratic transform are first
employed to transform the complex fractional forms into linear ones. Then, an
iterative algorithm is designed by decomposing the resulting problem to obtain
the suboptimal solution. The closed-form solutions for the transmit power, the
RC, and the local computing frequency are provided for more insights. Besides,
the analytical performance gain with the reciprocal mode is also derived.

The photospheric magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager are

find that the coronal hole and the coronal dimming become indistinguishable

similar to that of a coronal hole, with a mixture of plasma upflows and
downflows observable after the merging. The brightening of bright points and
the appearance of coronal jets inside the merged region further imply ongoing

crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are
encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in
experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be
accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are
described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to
the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated
Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion
crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional
$\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to
quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the
range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to
probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT).
Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to
observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with
the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can
be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of
thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations

information for classification:(1) intra-video information, determined by frame
content within a single video clip, and (2) inter-video information, measured
by relationships (e.g., feature similarity) among videos. However, existing
methods inadequately exploit these two information sources. In terms of
intra-video information, current sampling operations for input videos may omit
critical action information, reducing the utilization efficiency of video data.
For the inter-video information, the action misalignment among videos makes it
challenging to calculate precise relationships. Moreover, how to jointly
consider both inter- and intra-video information remains under-explored for
few-shot action recognition. To this end, we propose a novel framework, Video
Information Maximization (VIM), for few-shot video action recognition. VIM is
equipped with an adaptive spatial-temporal video sampler and a spatiotemporal
action alignment model to maximize intra- and inter-video information,
respectively. The video sampler adaptively selects important frames and
amplifies critical spatial regions for each input video based on the task at
hand. This preserves and emphasizes informative parts of video clips while
eliminating interference at the data level. The alignment model performs
temporal and spatial action alignment sequentially at the feature level,
leading to more precise measurements of inter-video similarity. Finally, These
goals are facilitated by incorporating additional loss terms based on mutual
information measurement. Consequently, VIM acts to maximize the distinctiveness
of video information from limited video data. Extensive experimental results on

voxel-based, point-based and Transformer-based methods, which consists of
Voxel-Based Branch (V branch), Point-Based Transformer Branch (PT branch) and
Point-Based Branch (P branch). The V branch extracts the coarse-grained
features of the point cloud through low voxel resolution; the PT branch obtains
the fine-grained features of the point cloud by calculating the self-attention
in the local neighborhood and the inter-neighborhood cross-attention; the P
branch uses a simplified MLP network to generate the global location

point clouds at different scales, we set the voxel scale in the V branch and
the neighborhood sphere scale in the PT branch to one large and one small
(large voxel scale \& small neighborhood sphere scale or small voxel scale \&
large neighborhood sphere scale). Finally, we use VTP as the feature extraction
network to construct a VTPNet for point cloud learning, and performs shape

can be of significance in many settings of distributed computing, e.g., in
sensor networks where energy consumption is of concern.
  In that paper, Chatterjee et al. provide an elegant randomized algorithm for
the Maximal Independent Set (MIS) problem that achieves an $O(1)$ node-averaged
awake complexity. That is, the average awake time among the nodes is $O(1)$
rounds. However, to achieve that, the algorithm sacrifices the more standard

interpolation scheme and incorporates context-knowledge by its structure.
Especially, the value function surrogate is elegantly enforced to be 0 in the

model. The algorithm is proposed in a matrix-free way, which circumvents the
large-matrix-problem for multivariate Hermite interpolation. For finite time
horizons, both convergence of the surrogate to the value function as well as
for the surrogate vs. the optimal controlled dynamical system are proven.
Experiments support the effectiveness of the scheme, using among others a new

determining the content that users are exposed to on social media platforms.
However, the behavioural patterns of these systems are often opaque and
non-replicable, complicating the evaluation of their impact on the
dissemination and consumption of disinformation and misinformation. To begin
addressing this evidence gap, this study presents a measurement approach that
uses observed digital traces to infer the current status of algorithmic
amplification of low-trust content on Twitter. Using an original dataset of 2.7
million posts on COVID-19 and climate change published on the platform in a
14-day period in January 2023, this study identifies tweets sharing information
from domains rated as low-trust by IffyNews (n=74,467), and for each tweet
author, compares the impressions of tweets containing low-trust information
against an impressions benchmark generated from the author's timeline. To
minimise the influence of factors traditionally understood to influence
impressions, the data is grouped by tweet author, and the sample is stratified
twice, controlling for the effect of tweet-level sentiment and engagement.
Through this approach, it is possible to assess whether, for any given user,
Twitter's recommender system amplifies the impressions - and as a consequence,
the visibility - of potentially misleading information regardless of critical
confounding factors. This analysis provides observational evidence on whether
the Twitter algorithm favours the visibility of low-trust content, with results
indicating that tweets containing low-trust URL domains perform significantly
better than tweets that do not across all sample stratifications. This suggests
that in its current form, Twitter's recommender system may be facilitating the
diffusion of false content, even when originating from notoriously low-trust

change the source code in parallel to implement new features, fix bugs,
refactor existing code, and make other changes. These simultaneous changes need
to be merged into the same version of the source code. However, the merge
operation can fail, and developer intervention is required to resolve the
conflicts. Studies in the literature show that 10 to 20 percent of all merge
attempts result in conflicts, which require the manual developer's intervention
to complete the process. In this paper, we concern about a specific type of
change that affects the structure of the source code and has the potential to
increase the merge effort: code refactorings. We analyze the relationship
between the occurrence of refactorings and the merge effort. To do so, we
applied a data mining technique called association rule extraction to find
patterns of behavior that allow us to analyze the influence of refactorings on
the merge effort. Our experiments extracted association rules from 40,248 merge
commits that occurred in 28 popular open-source projects. The results indicate
that: (i) the occurrence of refactorings increases the chances of having merge
effort; (ii) the more refactorings, the greater the chances of effort; (iii)
the more refactorings, the greater the effort; and (iv) parallel refactorings
increase even more the chances of having effort, as well as the intensity of
it. The results obtained may suggest behavioral changes in the way refactorings
are implemented by developer teams. In addition, they can indicate possible
ways to improve tools that support code merging and those that recommend
refactorings, considering the number of refactorings and merge effort
attributes.

the proposed remnant appears small if compared with the pulsar characteristic

modeled by an intrinsic surface reactivity $\kappa$ of the patch, giving rise

which can limit the scope of uncertainty analysis. To address this, we explore
the use of a spatio-temporal neural-based modelling approach to directly

parameters. The uncertainty is represented by deliberately perturbing the input
weather forecast during model training. The computational load is concentrated
in the model training process, which allows larger probability spaces to be

SPARK simulation platform, with an overall Jaccard index (similarity score) of
67.4% on a set of 35 simulated fires. When compared to a related neural model

bound of $\Omega(D)$ where $D$ denotes the diameter of the structure. Inspired
by the nervous and muscular system, Feldmann et al. have proposed the
reconfigurable circuit extension and the joint movement extension of the
amoebot model with the goal of breaking this lower bound.
  In the joint movement extension, the way amoebots move is altered. Amoebots
become able to push and pull other amoebots. Feldmann et al. demonstrated the
power of joint movements by transforming a line of amoebots into a rhombus

and locomotion.
  We approach these problems by defining meta-modules of rhombical and
hexagonal shape, respectively. The meta-modules are capable of movement
primitives like sliding, rotating, and tunneling. This allows us to simulate
shape formation algorithms of various modular robot systems. Finally, we

can be critical to generate safe motion and feasible actuator commands. In this
paper, we propose a gradient-based redundancy resolution framework that
optimizes velocity/compliance manipulability-based performance indices during
trajectory tracking for a kinematically redundant CTR. We efficiently calculate
the gradients of manipulabilities by propagating the first- and second-order
derivatives of state variables of the Cosserat rod model along the CTR arc
length, reducing the gradient computation time by 68\% compared to finite
difference method. Task-specific performance indices are optimized by
projecting the gradient into the null-space of trajectory tracking. The
proposed method is validated in three exemplary scenarios that involve
trajectory tracking, obstacle avoidance, and external load compensation,
respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed method is able to
accomplish the required tasks while commonly used redundancy resolution
approaches underperform or even fail.

simulations incorporate a luminosity function composed of 2 magnitudes of red
giant branch (RGB) stars leading up to the tip, with asymptotic giant branch
(AGB) stars contributing exclusively to the luminosity function for at least a
magnitude above the RGB tip. We quantify the sensitivity of the TRGB detection
and measurement to three important error sources: (1) the sample size of stars
near the tip, (2) the photometric measurement uncertainties at the tip, and (3)
the degree of self-crowding of the RGB population. The self-crowding creates a
population of supra-TRGB stars due to the blending of one or more RGB stars
just below the tip. This last population is ultimately difficult, though still
possible, to disentangle from true AGB stars. In the analysis given here, the
precepts and general methodology as used in the Chicago-Carnegie Hubble Program
(CCHP) has been followed. However, in the Appendix, we introduce and test a set
of new tip detection kernels which internally incorporate self-consistent
smoothing. These are generalizations of the two-step model used by the CCHP
(smoothing followed by Sobel-filter tip detection), where the new kernels are
based on successive binomial-coefficient approximations to the
Derivative-of-a-Gaussian (DoG) edge detector, as is commonly used in modern
digital image processing.

capturing the dynamics of the solution without knowing the physics inside the

parametric DMD by RBF interpolation. Specifically, an RBF network is first
trained using snapshot matrices at limited parameter samples. The snapshot
matrix at any new parameter sample can be quickly learned from the RBF network.
DMD will use the newly generated snapshot matrix at the online stage to predict
the time patterns of the dynamics corresponding to the new parameter sample.

thereby resolving a conjecture of Davies and Perkins in an optimal form. Here,
$\alpha_{c}(\Delta)n$ is the NP-hardness threshold for the problem of counting
independent sets of a given size in a graph on $n$ vertices of maximum degree

$\ell_\infty$-independence from a suitable distribution on the discrete cube --
in this case, the hard-core model -- to the slice by proving stability of an
Edgeworth expansion using a multivariate zero-free region for the base

corruption is challenging, both computationally and statistically. Convex
approaches have been proven statistically optimal but suffer from high
computational costs, especially since the robust loss functions are usually
non-smooth. More recently, computationally fast non-convex approaches via
sub-gradient descent are proposed, which, unfortunately, fail to deliver a
statistically consistent estimator even under sub-Gaussian noise. In this
paper, we introduce a projected sub-gradient descent algorithm for both the
sparse linear regression and low-rank linear regression problems. The algorithm
is not only computationally efficient with linear convergence but also
statistically optimal, be the noise Gaussian or heavy-tailed with a finite 1 +
epsilon moment. The convergence theory is established for a general framework
and its specific applications to absolute loss, Huber loss and quantile loss
are investigated. Compared with existing non-convex methods, ours reveals a
surprising phenomenon of two-phase convergence. In phase one, the algorithm
behaves as in typical non-smooth optimization that requires gradually decaying
stepsizes. However, phase one only delivers a statistically sub-optimal
estimator, which is already observed in the existing literature. Interestingly,
during phase two, the algorithm converges linearly as if minimizing a smooth
and strongly convex objective function, and thus a constant stepsize suffices.
Underlying the phase-two convergence is the smoothing effect of random noise to
the non-smooth robust losses in an area close but not too close to the truth.
Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical discovery and showcase the
superiority of our algorithm over prior methods.

(e.g., patients within transplant centers), it is often of interest to estimate
and perform inference on the treatment effects of the cluster units. However,
it is well-established that cluster-level confounding variables can bias these
assessments, and many of these confounding factors may be unobservable. In
healthcare settings, data sharing restrictions often make it impossible to
directly fit conventional risk-adjustment models on patient-level data, and
existing privacy-preserving approaches cannot adequately adjust for both
observed and unobserved cluster-level confounding factors. In this paper, we
propose a privacy-preserving model for cluster-level confounding that only
depends on publicly-available summary statistics, can be fit using a single

addition, we develop a Pseudo-Bayesian inference procedure that accounts for
the estimated cluster-level confounding effects and corrects for the impact of
unobservable factors. Simulations show that our estimates are robust and

  Diverse Biomedical Data Sources",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Machine learning (ML) in healthcare presents numerous opportunities for
enhancing patient care, population health, and healthcare providers' workflows.
However, the real-world clinical and cost benefits remain limited due to
challenges in data privacy, heterogeneous data sources, and the inability to
fully leverage multiple data modalities. In this perspective paper, we
introduce ""patchwork learning"" (PL), a novel paradigm that addresses these
limitations by integrating information from disparate datasets composed of
different data modalities (e.g., clinical free-text, medical images, omics) and
distributed across separate and secure sites. PL allows the simultaneous
utilization of complementary data sources while preserving data privacy,
enabling the development of more holistic and generalizable ML models. We
present the concept of patchwork learning and its current implementations in
healthcare, exploring the potential opportunities and applicable data sources
for addressing various healthcare challenges. PL leverages bridging modalities
or overlapping feature spaces across sites to facilitate information sharing
and impute missing data, thereby addressing related prediction tasks. We
discuss the challenges associated with PL, many of which are shared by
federated and multimodal learning, and provide recommendations for future
research in this field. By offering a more comprehensive approach to healthcare
data integration, patchwork learning has the potential to revolutionize the
clinical applicability of ML models. This paradigm promises to strike a balance
between personalization and generalizability, ultimately enhancing patient

workflows.

the main threats to sustainability. These behaviors have been extensively
studied, notably to predict, and arguably deviate, dead-end trajectories.
Behind the apparent complexity of such interaction networks, systems analysts
have identified a small group of repeated patterns in all systems, called
archetypes. For instance, the archetype of escalation is made of two positive
feedback loops fueling one another and is prevalent when competition arises, as
in arms race for instance. Interestingly, none of the known archetypes provide
sustainability: they all trigger endless amplification. In parallel, in systems
biology, there has been considerable advances on incoherent loops in molecular
networks in the past 20 years. Such patterns in biological networks produce
stability and a form on intrinsic autonomy for all functions, from circadian
rhythm to immunity. Incoherence is the fuel of homeostasis of living systems.
Here, I bridge both conclusions and propose that incoherence should be
considered as a new operational archetype buffering socio-ecological
fluctuations. This proposition is supported by the well-known trade-off between
robustness and efficiency: adaptability requires some degree of incoherence.
This applies to both technical and social systems: incoherent strategies
recognize and fuel the diversity of solutions; they are the essential, yet
often ignored, components of cooperation. Building on these theoretical
considerations and real-life examples, incoherence might offer a
counterintuitive, but transformative, way out of the great acceleration, and
possibly, an actionable lever for decision makers.

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been recently proposed as an

In this work, PINNs are employed to predict the velocity field of a rarefied

Stokes phenomenological model using an effective viscosity function. We found
that activation functions with limited smoothness result in orders of magnitude
larger errors than infinitely differentiable functions and that the AdamW is by
far the best optimizer for this inverse problem. The design was found to be
robust from Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.1 to 10. Our findings stand as a

fluctuations in the long wavelength range decay to zero. In reciprocal space
this behavior translates into a decay of Fourier intensities in the range near
small wavenumbers. In this paper quasiperiodic tilings constructed by word
concatenation are under study. The lattice is generated from a parameter given
by its continued fraction so that quasiperiodicity emerges for infinite when
irrational generators are into consideration. Numerical simulations show a
quite regular quadratic decay of Fourier intensities, regardless of the number
considered for the generator parameter, which leads us to formulate the
hypothesis that this type of media is strongly hyperuniform of order 3.
Theoretical derivations show that the density fluctuations scale in the same
proportion as the wavenumbers. Furthermore, it is rigorously proved that the
structure factor decays around the origin according to the pattern $S(k) \sim

present a novel self-supervised method for learning dense 3D facial geometry

geometry annotations in training. We further propose a strategy to learn
pixel-level uncertainties to perceive more reliable rigid-motion pixels for
geometry learning. Secondly, we design an effective geometry-guided facial
keypoint estimation module, providing accurate keypoints for generating motion
fields. Lastly, we develop a 3D-aware cross-modal (ie, appearance and depth)
attention mechanism, which can be applied to each generation layer, to capture
facial geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments are
conducted on three challenging benchmarks (ie, VoxCeleb1, VoxCeleb2, and HDTF).

``the activities of one economic actor affect the activities of another in ways
that are not reflected in market transactions,'' is applicable to analyze the
social dilemmas in MARL. One of its most profound non-market solutions,
``Pigovian Tax'', which internalizes externalities by taxing those who create
negative externalities and subsidizing those who create positive externalities,
could aid in developing a mechanism to resolve MARL's social dilemmas. The
purpose of this paper is to apply externality theory to analyze social dilemmas
in MARL. To internalize the externalities in MARL, the \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{P}igovian \textbf{T}ax method (LOPT), is proposed,
where an additional agent is introduced to learn the tax/allowance allocation

mechanism based on the approximated optimal ``Pigovian Tax'' is applied to
reduce the social cost of each agent and tries to alleviate the social

However, most session type approaches assume an ideal world: one in which

distributed systems in the real world. To address this limitation, we introduce
Teatrino, a code generation toolchain that utilises asynchronous multiparty
session types (MPST) with crash-stop semantics to support failure handling
protocols. We augment asynchronous MPST and processes with crash handling
branches. Our approach requires no user-level syntax extensions for global
types and features a formalisation of global semantics, which captures complex
behaviours induced by crashed/crash handling processes. The sound and complete
correspondence between global and local type semantics guarantees
deadlock-freedom, protocol conformance, and liveness of typed processes in the
presence of crashes. Our theory is implemented in the toolchain Teatrino, which
provides correctness by construction. Teatrino extends the Scribble multiparty
protocol language to generate protocol-conforming Scala code, using the Effpi
concurrent programming library. We extend both Scribble and Effpi to support
crash-stop behaviour. We demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology and
evaluate Teatrino with examples extended from both session type and distributed

In most of these models, only repulsive forces and advection terms are taken
into account. In order to take into account long range interactions, we include
for the first time a surface tension effect by adding a nonlocal term which
leads to the degenerate nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation, and study the
incompressible limit of the system. The degeneracy and the source term are the
main difficulties. Our approach relies on a new L^infty estimate obtained by De
Giorgi iterations and on a uniform control of the energy despite the source
term. We also prove the long-term convergence to a single constant stationary

having hydrogen-dominated atmospheres that are a few percent of the total mass

the measured spectra are featureless, and thus inconclusive, due to the

systems when non-analyticities occur at critical times in the return rate, a
dynamical analogue of the free energy. This extension of the concept of phase
transitions can be brought into contact with another, namely that of
topological phase transitions in which the phase transition is marked by a
change in a topological invariant. Following a quantum quench dynamical quantum
phase transitions can happen in topological matter, a fact which has already
been explored in one dimensional topological insulators and in two dimensional
Chern insulators. Additionally in one dimensional systems a dynamical bulk
boundary correspondence has been seen, related to the periodic appearance of
zero modes of the Loschmidt echo itself. Here we extend both of these concepts
to two dimensional higher order topological matter, in which the topologically
protected boundary modes are corner modes. We consider a minimal model which
encompasses all possible forms of higher order topology in two dimensional
topological band structures. We find that DQPTs can still occur, and can occur
for quenches which cross both bulk and boundary gap closings. Furthermore a
dynamical bulk boundary correspondence is also found, which takes a different

  Autonomous Driving","Accepted by CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  End-to-end autonomous driving has made impressive progress in recent years.
Existing methods usually adopt the decoupled encoder-decoder paradigm, where
the encoder extracts hidden features from raw sensor data, and the decoder
outputs the ego-vehicle's future trajectories or actions. Under such a
paradigm, the encoder does not have access to the intended behavior of the ego
agent, leaving the burden of finding out safety-critical regions from the
massive receptive field and inferring about future situations to the decoder.
Even worse, the decoder is usually composed of several simple multi-layer
perceptrons (MLP) or GRUs while the encoder is delicately designed (e.g., a
combination of heavy ResNets or Transformer). Such an imbalanced resource-task
division hampers the learning process.
  In this work, we aim to alleviate the aforementioned problem by two
principles: (1) fully utilizing the capacity of the encoder; (2) increasing the
capacity of the decoder. Concretely, we first predict a coarse-grained future
position and action based on the encoder features. Then, conditioned on the
position and action, the future scene is imagined to check the ramification if
we drive accordingly. We also retrieve the encoder features around the
predicted coordinate to obtain fine-grained information about the
safety-critical region. Finally, based on the predicted future and the
retrieved salient feature, we refine the coarse-grained position and action by
predicting its offset from ground-truth. The above refinement module could be
stacked in a cascaded fashion, which extends the capacity of the decoder with
spatial-temporal prior knowledge about the conditioned future. We conduct
experiments on the CARLA simulator and achieve state-of-the-art performance in
closed-loop benchmarks. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the
effectiveness of each proposed module.

ultrathin films hosting an hexagonal (Pd/Fe/Ir(111)) and a square (Fe/Ir(111))
skyrmion lattice, which can both be described by an extended Heisenberg
Hamiltonian. We first examine whether the Dzyaloshinkskii-Moriya, or the
exchange interaction as the leading energy term affects the modes of the
hexagonal skX of Pd/Fe/Ir(111). In all cases, we find that the lowest frequency
modes correspond to internal degrees of freedom of individual skyrmions, and
suggest a classification based on azimuthal and radial numbers $(l,p)$, with up
to $l=6$, and $p=2$. We also show that the gyration behavior induced by an
in-plane field corresponds to the excitation of $l=1$ deformation modes with
varying radial numbers. Second, we examine the square lattice of skyrmions of
Fe/Ir(111). Its stabilization mechanism is dominated by the 4-spin interaction.
After relaxation, the unit cell does not carry a topological charge, and the
eigenmodes do not correspond to internal skyrmion deformations. By reducing the
4-spin interaction, the integer topological charge is recovered, but the charge
carriers do not possess internal degrees of freedom, nor are they separated by
energy barriers. We conclude that a 4-spin dominated Hamiltonian does not yield
skyrmion lattice solutions, and that therefore, a nontrivial topology does not
imply the existence of skyrmions.

temperature as anharmonic excitations commence as the system emerges from a
deep minimum of the potential energy landscape where harmonic vibrations
dominate. The polypeptide bacitracin and two globular proteins, lysozyme and
human serum albumin, showed a more complex temperature dependence. Further
analysis focused on the spectral signature below and above the boson peak. We
found evidence for the onset of anharmonic motions that are characteristic for
partial unfolding and molecular jamming in the dry biomolecules. The activation
of modes of the protein molecules at temperatures comparable to the protein
dynamical transition temperature was observed in the absence of hydration. No
evidence for Fr\""ohlich coherence, postulated to facilitate biological
function, was found in our experiments.

gathering heterogeneous features from different platforms. However, such
cross-silo collaborations between platforms are restricted by increasingly
stringent privacy protection regulations, thus data cannot be aggregated for
training. Federated learning (FL) is a practical solution to deal with the data
silo problem in recommendation scenarios. Existing cross-silo FL methods
transmit model information to collaboratively build a global model by
leveraging the data of overlapped users. However, in reality, the number of
overlapped users is often very small, thus largely limiting the performance of
such approaches. Moreover, transmitting model information during training
requires high communication costs and may cause serious privacy leakage. In
this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving double distillation framework
named FedPDD for cross-silo federated recommendation, which efficiently
transfers knowledge when overlapped users are limited. Specifically, our double
distillation strategy enables local models to learn not only explicit knowledge
from the other party but also implicit knowledge from its past predictions.
Moreover, to ensure privacy and high efficiency, we employ an offline training
scheme to reduce communication needs and privacy leakage risk. In addition, we
adopt differential privacy to further protect the transmitted information. The
experiments on two real-world recommendation datasets, HetRec-MovieLens and
Criteo, demonstrate the effectiveness of FedPDD compared to the

identifying planning target volume (PTV), and organs at risk (OARs), and
determining the limitations for them to receive radiation, the dose
distribution is performed based on optimization algorithms, which is usually a
time-consuming method. In this article, artificial intelligence is used to
acquire the knowledge used in the treatment planning of past patients and to
plan for new patients to speed up the process of treatment planning and
determination of the appropriate dose distribution. In this paper, using deep
learning algorithms, two different approaches are studied to predict dose
distribution and compared with actual dose distributions. In the first method,
only the images containing PTV and the distribution of the corresponding doses
are used to train the convolutional neural network, but in the second one, in
addition to PTV, the contours of four OARs are also used to introduce the
network. The results show that the performance of both methods on test patients
have high accuracy and in comparison with each other almost have the same
results and high speed to design the dose distribution. Because the Only-PTV
method does not have the process of OARs identifying, applying it in designing
the dose distribution will be much faster than using the PTV-OARs method in the

the technique by inferring stellar mass and radius from an individual stellar

the mind ethereal, distinct from the body. Past research also shows that
Dualism emerges, in part, via learning (e.g., Barlev & Shtulman, 2021). But
whether learning is sufficient to give rise to Dualism is unknown.The evidence
from human learners does address this question because humans are endowed not
only with general learning capacities but also with core knowledge capacities.
And recent results suggest that core knowledge begets Dualism (Berent, Theodore
& Valencia, 2021; Berent, 2023). To evaluate the role of learning, here, we
probe for a mind-body divide in Davinci--a large language model (LLM) that is
devoid of any innate core knowledge. We show that Davinci still leans towards
Dualism, and that this bias increases systematically with the learner's
inductive potential. Thus, davinci (a GPT-3 model) exhibits mild Dualist
tendencies, whereas its descendent, text-davinci-003 (a GPT-3.5 model), shows a
full-blown bias. It selectively considers thoughts (epistemic states) as
disembodied--as unlikely to show up in the body (in the brain), but not in its
absence (after death). While Davinci's performance is constrained by its
syntactic limitations, and it differs from humans, its Dualist bias is robust.
These results demonstrate that the mind-body divide is partly learnable from
experience.They also show how, as LLM's are exposed to human narratives, they
induce not only human knowledge but also human biases.

challenging due to the high patient-doctor ratio, the potential long medical
histories, the urgency of treatment for some medical conditions, and patient
variability. The current system provides a longitudinal view of patient medical
history, which is time-consuming to browse, and doctors often need to engage
nurses, residents, and others for initial analysis. To overcome this
limitation, our vision, Atlas EHR, is an alternative spatial representation of
patients' histories (e.g., electronic health records (EHRs)) and other
biomedical data. Just like Google Maps allows a global, national, regional, and
local view, the Atlas-EHR may start with the overview of the patient's anatomy
and history before drilling down to spatially anatomical sub-systems, their
individual components, or sub-components. It will also use thoughtful
cartography (e.g., urgency color, disease icons, and symbols) to highlight
critical information for improving task efficiency and decision quality,
analogous to how it is used in designing task-specific maps. Atlas-EHR presents
a compelling opportunity for spatial computing since health is almost a fifth

geographic use cases (e.g., navigation, land survey, mapping) faces many
hurdles in the biomedical domain, presenting several research questions. This

novel attack scheme that utilizes low-pass filter to inject backdoor in

approach reduces high-frequency components and preserve original images'

capability of evading current defenses. Besides, we introduce ""precision mode""
to make our backdoor triggered at a specified level of filtering, which further
improves stealthiness. We evaluate our low-pass attack on four datasets and
demonstrate that even under pollution rate of 0.01, we can perform stealthy
attack without trading off attack performance. Besides, our backdoor attack can
successfully bypass state-of-the-art defending mechanisms. We also compare our

frequency-domain backdooring technique. In particular, our method aims to add a
backdoor trigger in the frequency domain of original images via Discrete
Fourier Transform, thus hidding the trigger. We evaluate our method on three

we can simultaneously fool human inspection and DNN models. We further apply

  with item embedding",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Estimating position bias is a well-known challenge in Learning to rank (L2R).
Click data in e-commerce applications, such as advertisement targeting and
search engines, provides implicit but abundant feedback to improve personalized
rankings. However, click data inherently include various biases like position
bias. Click modeling is aimed at denoising biases in click data and extracting
reliable signals. Result Randomization and Regression Expectation-maximization
algorithm have been proposed to solve position bias. Both methods require
various pairs of observations (item, position). However, in real cases of
advertising, marketers frequently display advertisements in a fixed
pre-determined order, and estimation suffers from it. We propose this sparsity
of (item, position) in position bias estimation as a novel problem, and we
propose a variant of the Regression EM algorithm which utilizes item embeddings
to alleviate the issue of the sparsity. With a synthetic dataset, we first
evaluate how the position bias estimation suffers from the sparsity and
skewness of the logging dataset. Next, with a real-world dataset, we
empirically show that item embedding with Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and
Variational autoencoder (VAE) improves the estimation of position bias. Our
result shows that the Regression EM algorithm with VAE improves RMSE relatively
by 10.3% and EM with LSI improves RMSE relatively by 33.4%.

  astronauts and their support teams through increases in workload: Insights
  from the AMADEE-20 analog Mars mission",,,,,"physics.soc-ph astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Astronaut crews and ground control support teams are highly interdependent
teams that need to communicate effectively to achieve a safe mission - despite
being separated by large distances. Team communication quality with its facets
clarity of objectives and information flow is a key coordination process to
achieve high team performance and task satisfaction. Especially in
interdependent teams working in extreme environments with time-delayed
communications, the team's success depends on effective communication. We
hypothesized that communication quality affects two key team outcomes,
performance and task satisfaction, and that these effects can be explained by
increased workload (effort and frustration). Hypotheses were tested during the
AMADEE-20 analog Mars mission of the Austrian Space Forum. The analog
astronauts (AA) were supported by an On-Site-Support (OSS) team and a remote
Mission-Support-Centre (MSC) team. The MSC was the only contact for both AA and
OSS, and the communication between them had a one-way delay of 10 minutes. Our
study consisted of three runs in which members of each team had to exchange
information to solve an interdependent task. We measured communication quality,
effort and frustration, task satisfaction, and team performance. Results show
that clarity of objectives and information flow positively impacted multiteam
system performance. Furthermore, clarity of objectives reduced experienced
effort which in turn enhanced team performance. High levels of information flow
reduced experienced frustration, in turn enhancing task satisfaction. Our
findings show that these facets of communication quality are essential for
multiteam systems that work separated from each other. We stress that specific
(team) communication training for astronauts and support personnel will be key
to effective teamwork during future Mars missions, and thus to overall mission
success.

  Novo Molecular Design",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sample efficiency is a fundamental challenge in de novo molecular design.
Ideally, molecular generative models should learn to satisfy a desired
objective under minimal oracle evaluations (computational prediction or wet-lab
experiment). This problem becomes more apparent when using oracles that can
provide increased predictive accuracy but impose a significant cost.
Consequently, these oracles cannot be directly optimized under a practical
budget. Molecular generative models have shown remarkable sample efficiency
when coupled with reinforcement learning, as demonstrated in the Practical
Molecular Optimization (PMO) benchmark. Here, we propose a novel algorithm
called Augmented Memory that combines data augmentation with experience replay.
We show that scores obtained from oracle calls can be reused to update the
model multiple times. We compare Augmented Memory to previously proposed
algorithms and show significantly enhanced sample efficiency in an exploitation
task and a drug discovery case study requiring both exploration and
exploitation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in the PMO benchmark
which enforces a computational budget, outperforming the previous best
performing method on 19/23 tasks.

is crucial to detect when predictions are unreliable to avoid wrong or
misleading results. Here, we present a complete framework for training and
recalibrating graph neural network ensemble models to produce accurate
predictions of energy and forces with calibrated uncertainty estimates. The
proposed method considers both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and the
total uncertainties are recalibrated post hoc using a nonlinear scaling
function to achieve good calibration on previously unseen data, without loss of
predictive accuracy. The method is demonstrated and evaluated on two
challenging, publicly available datasets, ANI-1x (Smith et al.) and
Transition1x (Schreiner et al.), both containing diverse conformations far from
equilibrium. A detailed analysis of the predictive performance and uncertainty
calibration is provided. In all experiments, the proposed method achieved low
prediction error and good uncertainty calibration, with predicted uncertainty
correlating with expected error, on energy and forces. To the best of our
knowledge, the method presented in this paper is the first to consider a
complete framework for obtaining calibrated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty
predictions on both energy and forces in ML potentials.

artificial and motivated only to coherently generalize that concerning the

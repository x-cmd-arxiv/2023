nano-structures, with an aim towards possible applications. As information may
be eventually transmitted with efficiency stored in the phase and amplitude of
spin waves, a topic of interest within Magnonics is the propagation of SW
modes. Thus, understanding mechanisms that may influence SW propagation is of
interest. Here the effect of localized surface geometric defects on
magnetostatic surface modes propagation is studied in ferromagnetic films and
semi-infinite media. Theoretical results are developed that allow to calculate
the scattering of these surface or Damon-Eshbach (DE) modes. A Green-Extinction
theorem is used to determine the scattering of incident surface modes, through
the determination of phase shifts of associated modes that are symmetric and
anti-symmetric under inversion in the same geometry with geometric defects.
Choosing localized symmetric depressions as geometric defects, scattering
transmission coefficients are determined that show perfect transmission at
specific frequencies or wave-lengths, that we associate with resonances in the
system. Interestingly the system shows the appearance of localized modes in the
depression regions, with associated discrete frequencies immersed in the
continuum spectrum of these surface DE modes. These localized modes have a
short wave-length content, and appear similarly in semi-infinite surfaces with
depressions. The latter indicates that these types of scattering effects should
appear in all surfaces with roughness or more pronounced geometric defects.

These problems can be formulated as detecting anomalous change points in a

lack robustness to large amounts of node additions/deletions, and overlook
changes in node attributes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
spectral method: Scalable Change Point Detection (SCPD). SCPD generates an
embedding for each graph snapshot by efficiently approximating the distribution
of the Laplacian spectrum at each step. SCPD can also capture shifts in node
attributes by tracking correlations between attributes and eigenvectors.
Through extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data, we show that
SCPD (a) achieves state-of-the art performance, (b) is significantly faster
than the state-of-the-art methods and can easily process millions of edges in a
few CPU minutes, (c) can effectively tackle a large quantity of node

whether one can find a physically relevant noise regularizing the PDE. We

shown that by generalizing the entropic contribution to the free energy to
allow for independent representations in each spectral domain, the free energy
becomes an upper bound to the exact one, attaining this limit as
representations approach Kohn-Sham eigenfunctions. A numerical procedure is
devised for effective calculation of the generalized entropy associated with
spectral partitioning of the density matrix. The result is a powerful framework
for Kohn-Sham calculations of systems whose occupied subspaces span multiple
energy regimes. As a case in point, we apply the proposed framework to warm-
and hot-dense matter described by finite-temperature density functional theory,
where at high energies the density matrix is represented by that of the
free-electron gas, while at low energies it is variationally optimized. We
derive expressions for the spectral-partitioned Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian, atomic
forces, and macroscopic stresses within the projector-augmented wave (PAW) and
the norm-conserving pseudopotential methods. It is demonstrated that at high
temperatures, spectral partitioning facilitates accurate calculations at
dramatically reduced computational cost. Moreover, as temperature is increased,
fewer exact Kohn-Sham states are required for a given accuracy, leading to
further reductions in computational cost. Finally, it is shown that standard
multi-projector expansions of electronic orbitals within atomic spheres in the
PAW method lack sufficient completeness at high temperatures. Spectral

learning (DL) models have been commonly employed in load forecasting problems
supported by adaptation mechanisms to cope with the changing pattern of
consumption by customers, known as concept drift. A drift magnitude threshold
should be defined to design change detection methods to identify drifts. While
the drift magnitude in load forecasting problems can vary significantly over
time, existing literature often assumes a fixed drift magnitude threshold,
which should be dynamically adjusted rather than fixed during system evolution.
To address this gap, in this paper, we propose a dynamic drift-adaptive Long

several strategies into the framework based on active and passive adaptation

increases the search space of the technique, which facilitates obtaining
high-performing and efficient optimized designs. Structures with multiple
materials involving fluidic pressure loads find various applications. However,
dealing with the design-dependent nature of the pressure loads is challenging
in topology optimization that gets even more pronounced with a multi-material
framework. This paper provides a density-based topology optimization method to
design fluidic pressure loadbearing multi-material structures. The design
domain is parameterized using hexagonal elements as they ensure nonsingular
connectivity. Pressure modeling is performed using the Darcy law with a
conceptualized drainage term. The flow coefficient of each element is
determined using a smooth Heaviside function considering its solid and void
states. The consistent nodal loads are determined using the standard finite
element methods. Multiple materials is modeled using the extended SIMP scheme.
Compliance minimization with volume constraints is performed to achieve
optimized loadbearing structures. Few examples are presented to demonstrate the
efficacy and versatility of the proposed approach. The optimized results
contain the prescribed amount of different materials.

material than the surroundings. Coronal rain is known to be deeply linked to
coronal heating, but its origin, dynamics, and morphology are still not well
understood. The leading theory for its origin is thermal instability (TI)
occurring in coronal loops in a state of thermal non-equilibrium (TNE), the
TNE-TI scenario. Under steady heating conditions, TNE-TI repeats in cycles,
leading to long-period EUV intensity pulsations and periodic coronal rain. In
this study, we investigate coronal rain on the large spatial scales of an
active region (AR) and over the long temporal scales of EUV intensity
pulsations to elucidate its distribution at such scales. We conduct a
statistical study of coronal rain observed over an AR off-limb with IRIS and
SDO imaging data, spanning chromospheric to transition region (TR)
temperatures. The rain is widespread across the AR, irrespective of the loop
inclination, and with minimal variation over the 5.45-hour duration of the
observation. Most rain has a downward ($87.5\%$) trajectory; however, upward
motions ($12.5\%$) are also ubiquitous. The rain dynamics are similar over the
observed temperature range, suggesting that the TR and chromospheric emission
are co-located on average. The average clump widths and lengths are similar in
the SJI channels and wider in the AIA 304 channel. We find ubiquitous
long-period EUV intensity pulsations in the AR. Short-term periodicity is found
(16 min) linked to the rain appearance, which constitutes a challenge to
explain under the TNE-TI scenario.

Nevertheless, their potential to enhance 3D scene representation learning
remains largely untapped due to the domain gap. In this paper, we propose an
innovative methodology Bridge3D to address this gap, pre-training 3D models
using features, semantic masks, and captions sourced from foundation models.
Specifically, our approach utilizes semantic masks from these models to guide
the masking and reconstruction process in the masked autoencoder. This strategy
enables the network to concentrate more on foreground objects, thereby
enhancing 3D representation learning. Additionally, we bridge the 3D-text gap
at the scene level by harnessing image captioning foundation models. To further
facilitate knowledge distillation from well-learned 2D and text representations
to the 3D model, we introduce a novel method that employs foundation models to
generate highly accurate object-level masks and semantic text information at
the object level. Our approach notably outshines state-of-the-art methods in 3D

applications, such as networking, tracing, and security, thanks to the
programmability it provides. By allowing user-supplied eBPF programs to be
executed directly in the kernel, it greatly increases the flexibility and
efficiency of deploying customized logic. However, eBPF also introduces a new
and wide attack surface: malicious eBPF programs may try to exploit the
vulnerabilities in the eBPF subsystem in the kernel.
  Fuzzing is a promising technique to find such vulnerabilities. Unfortunately,
our experiments with the state-of-the-art kernel fuzzer, Syzkaller, shows that
it cannot effectively fuzz the eBPF runtime, those components that are in
charge of executing an eBPF program, for two reasons. First, the eBPF verifier
(which is tasked with verifying the safety of eBPF programs) rejects many
fuzzing inputs because (1) they do not comply with its required semantics or
(2) they miss some dependencies, i.e., other syscalls that need to be issued
before the program is loaded. Second, Syzkaller fails to attach and trigger the
execution of eBPF programs most of the times.
  This paper introduces the BPF Runtime Fuzzer (BRF), a fuzzer that can satisfy
the semantics and dependencies required by the verifier and the eBPF subsystem.
Our experiments show, in 48-hour fuzzing sessions, BRF can successfully execute
8x more eBPF programs compared to Syzkaller. Moreover, eBPF programs generated
by BRF are much more expressive than Syzkaller's. As a result, BRF achieves
101% higher code coverage. Finally, BRF has so far managed to find 4
vulnerabilities (some of them have been assigned CVE numbers) in the eBPF

example assumptions. This paper has two main results: First, we show that even
without worst-case assumptions, dramatically reduced travel speeds would be

that there may be parameter choices which require broader discussion, depending

research. Tokenization is an initial step in many biomedical text mining
pipelines. Tokenization is the process of parsing an input biomedical sentence
(represented as a digital character sequence) into a discrete set of word/token
symbols, which convey focused semantic/syntactic meaning. The objective of this
study is to explore variation in tokenizer outputs when applied across a series
of challenging biomedical sentences.
  Method: Diaz [2015] introduce 24 challenging example biomedical sentences for
comparing tokenizer performance. In this study, we descriptively explore
variation in outputs of eight tokenizers applied to each example biomedical
sentence. The tokenizers compared in this study are the NLTK white space
tokenizer, the NLTK Penn Tree Bank tokenizer, Spacy and SciSpacy tokenizers,
Stanza/Stanza-Craft tokenizers, the UDPipe tokenizer, and R-tokenizers.
  Results: For many examples, tokenizers performed similarly effectively;
however, for certain examples, there were meaningful variation in returned
outputs. The white space tokenizer often performed differently than other
tokenizers. We observed performance similarities for tokenizers implementing
rule-based systems (e.g. pattern matching and regular expressions) and
tokenizers implementing neural architectures for token classification.
Oftentimes, the challenging tokens resulting in the greatest variation in
outputs, are those words which convey substantive and focused
biomedical/clinical meaning (e.g. x-ray, IL-10, TCR/CD3, CD4+ CD8+, and
(Ca2+)-regulated).
  Conclusion: When state-of-the-art, open-source tokenizers from Python and R
were applied to a series of challenging biomedical example sentences, we
observed subtle variation in the returned outputs.

within the R$_{200}$ radius of 231 clusters and 11,460 field galaxies. We also
investigate the impact of the cluster's dynamic state, as well as the galaxy's
location in the projected phase space diagram (PPS). We found that although the
cluster environment as a whole influences galaxy evolution, the cluster
dynamical state does not. Furthermore, star-forming galaxies represent recent
cluster arrivals in comparison to passive galaxies (especially in the case of
early-types). Among the ETGs, we find that the D$_n(4000)$ and H$_\delta$
parameters indicate a smooth transition between the subpopulations. In
particular, for the SF-ETGs, we detect a significant difference between field

toward a picture where field galaxies are more likely to follow the monolithic
scenario, while the cluster galaxies the hierarchical scenario. In particular,
if we split the ETGs into lenticulars and ellipticals, we find that the steeper
color gradients are more common for the lenticulars. Finally, our results

While some IM algorithms aim to remedy disparity in information coverage using

us to leverage community detection techniques, making it possible to run
fair-aware algorithms when there are no relevant node attributes available, or
when node attributes do not accurately capture network community structure. In
contrast to other fair IM algorithms, this work relies on fitting a model to
the social network which is then used to determine a seed allocation strategy
for optimal fair information spread. We develop an algorithm to determine
optimal seed allocations for expected fair coverage, defined through maximum
entropy, provide some theoretical guarantees under appropriate conditions, and
demonstrate its empirical accuracy on both simu- lated and real networks.

The albedo operator takes the incoming flux to the outgoing flux at the
boundary. For simple compact Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n \geq 2$, we
study the stability of the absorption coefficient from the albedo operator up
to a gauge transformation. We derive that when the absorption coefficient is
isotropic then the albedo operator determines uniquely the absorption
coefficient and we establish a stability estimate. We also give an
identification result for the reconstruction of the scattering parameter. The
approach in this work is based on the construction of suitable geometric optics
solutions and the use of the invertibility of the geodesic ray transform.

owing to tides raised in the planet. As a result, the 5/3 mean motion resonance
between Ariel and Umbriel was likely encountered in the past. Previous studies
have shown that, in order to prevent entrapment in this resonance, the
eccentricities of the satellites must be larger than $\sim 0.01$ at the epoch,
which is hard to explain. On the other hand, if the satellites experience some
temporary capture and then escape, the inclinations rise to high values that
are not observed today. We have revisited this problem both analytically and
numerically focussing on the inclination, using a secular two-satellite model
with circular orbits. We show that if the inclination of Umbriel was around
$0.15^{\circ}$ at the time of the 5/3 resonance encounter, capture can be
avoided in about $60\%$ of the cases. Moreover, after the resonance crossing,
the inclination of Umbriel drops to a mean value around $0.08^{\circ}$, which
is close to the presently observed one. The final inclination of Ariel is
distributed between $0.01^{\circ}$ and $0.25^{\circ}$ with a nearly equal
probability, which includes the present mean value of $0.02^{\circ}$.

conversation modeling is an important task in natural language processing. New
breakthroughs in architecture and data gathering continue to push the
performance of such conversational AI models. However, designs neglect the
gradual buildup in sentence structure and complexity experienced by humans as
we learn to communicate. During training, our model accepts one or more
sentences as input and attempts to predict the next sentence in the
conversation one word at a time, so our goal is to separate training into
segments, with each segment's corpus comprised of longer sentence pairs than
the previous one. This will mimic the desired ""buildup"" component of human
learning. We begin with only ""short"" length sentence pairs, then only ""medium""
length pairs, and so on. A majority of our experiments were toward optimizing
this technique, ensuring a proper representation of the technique's potential,
since many of the details were new questions. Our segment-trained models were
then able to achieve lower validation loss at the end of training than models
trained with standard text preparation. This segmented training is
straightforward to implement and our results provide a general direction for

ultra-high-speed and secure data transfer with miniaturized devices for
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Existing THz channel models for
aerial scenarios assume a homogeneous medium along the line-of-sight
propagation path. However, the atmospheric turbulence due to random airflow
leads to temporal and spatial inhomogeneity of the communication medium,
motivating analysis and modelling of the THz UAV communication channel. In this
paper, we statistically modelled the scintillation and attenuation effect of
turbulence on THz UAV channels. Specifically, the frequency- and
altitude-dependency of the refractive index structure constant, as a critical
statistical parameter characterizing the intensity of turbulence, is first
investigated. Then, the scintillation characteristic and attenuation of the THz
communications caused by atmospheric turbulence are modelled, where the
scintillation effect is modelled by a Gamma-Gamma distribution, and the
turbulence attenuation as a function of altitude and frequency is derived.
Numerical simulations on the refractive index structure constant,
scintillation, and attenuation in the THz band are presented to quantitatively
analyze the influence of turbulence for the THz UAV channels. It is discovered
that THz turbulence can lead to at most 10dB attenuation with frequency less
than 1THz and distance less than 10km.

improve nuclear models sufficiently for future long-baseline neutrino

filled with a high-pressure gas is a promising detector to characterise the
neutrino sources planned for such experiments. A gas-filled TPC is ideal for
measuring low-energy particles as they travel much further in gas than solid or

suitability of multiwire proportional chambers (MWPCs) taken from the ALICE TPC
to be used as the readout chambers of a high-pressure gas TPC. These chambers
were previously operated at atmospheric pressure. We tested one such MWPC at up

an ALICE TPC outer readout chamber (OROC) at pressures up to 4.8 bar absolute

far up to 4 bar absolute with Ar-CO$_{2}$ (90-10). We measured the charge gain

ordering, remains an outstanding problem of modern solar physics. A number of
mechanisms that might plausibly contribute to its operation have been proposed,
but the relative role played by each remains unclear. This uncertainty stems
from continuing questions concerning the speed and structure of deep-seated
convective flows. Those flows are in-turn thought to sustain both the Sun's
turbulent EMF and the large-scale flows of differential rotation and meridional
circulation suspected of influencing the dynamo's organization and timing.
Continued progress in this area is complicated by (i) inconsistencies between
helioseismic measurements of convective and meridional flow made with different
techniques and instruments, and (ii) a lack of high-latitude data for
convection, differential rotation, and meridional flow. We suggest that the
path forward to resolving these difficulties is twofold. First, the acquisition
of long-term helioseismic and emissivity measurements obtained from a polar
vantage point is vital to complete our picture of the Sun's outer convection
zone. Second, sustained and expanded investment in theory-oriented and combined
theory/observational research initiatives will be crucial to fully exploit
these new observations and to resolve inconsistencies between existing
measurements.

These methods usually apply random data augmentation to input images, expecting
the augmented views of the same images to be similar and positively paired.
However, random augmentation may overlook image semantic information and
degrade the quality of augmented views in contrastive learning. This issue
becomes more challenging in medical images since the abnormalities related to
diseases can be tiny, and are easy to be corrupted (e.g., being cropped out) in
the current scheme of random augmentation. In this work, we first demonstrate
that, for widely-used X-ray images, the conventional augmentation prevalent in
contrastive pre-training can affect the performance of the downstream diagnosis
or classification tasks. Then, we propose a novel augmentation method, i.e.,
FocusContrast, to learn from radiologists' gaze in diagnosis and generate
contrastive views for medical images with guidance from radiologists' visual
attention. Specifically, we track the gaze movement of radiologists and model
their visual attention when reading to diagnose X-ray images. The learned model
can predict visual attention of the radiologists given a new input image, and
further guide the attention-aware augmentation that hardly neglects the
disease-related abnormalities. As a plug-and-play and framework-agnostic
module, FocusContrast consistently improves state-of-the-art contrastive

results show that the regionally weak species predominates in the local
ecosystem, while spiral patterns appear far from the region, where individuals
of every species play the rock-paper-scissors game with the same strength.
Because the weak species controls all local territory, it is attractive for the
other species to enter the local ecosystem to conquer the territory. However,
our stochastic simulations show that the transitory waves formed when organisms
of the strong species reach the region are quickly destroyed because of local
strength unbalance in the selection game rules. Computing the effect of the
topology on population dynamics, we find that the prevalence of the weak

show that the biodiversity loss due to the arising of regional unevenness is

generated from quantum computers by measuring the density along an adiabatic
transition between different molecular geometries. In lieu of using phase
estimation, the energy is evaluated by performing line-integration using the
inverted TDDFT Kohn-Sham potential obtained from the time-varying densities.
The accuracy of this method depends on the validity of the adiabatic evolution
itself and the potential inversion process (which is theoretically exact but
can be numerically unstable), whereas total evolution time is the defining
factor for the precision of phase estimation. We examine the method with a
one-dimensional system of two electrons for both the ground and first triplet
state in first quantization, as well as the ground state of three- and four-
electron systems in second quantization. It is shown that few accurate
measurements can be utilized to obtain chemical accuracy across the full
potential energy curve, with shorter propagation time than may be required
using phase estimation for a similar accuracy. We also show that an accurate
potential energy curve can be calculated by making many imprecise density
measurements (using few shots) along the time evolution and smoothing the
resulting density evolution. We discuss how one can generate full PESs using
either sparse grid representations or machine learning density functionals
where it is known that training the functional using the density (along with
the energy) generates a more transferable functional than only using the
energy. Finally, it is important to note that the method is able to classically
provide a check of its own accuracy by comparing the density resulting from a
time-independent Kohn-Sham calculation using the inverted potential, with the

cation diffusivity, but such an increase is universally followed by a decrease
for Li+ concentration lower than 6.3 - 6.5 Li molar content. Molecular dynamics
simulations based on density functional theory show that the maximum in
diffusivity originates from competing effects between the increased vacancy

Using semi-empirical models of galaxy evolution and SFR indicators sensitive to
different star formation timescales (e.g., H$\alpha$ and UV continuum
luminosities), we show that the SFR variability, quantified by the joint
probability distribution of the SFR indicators (i.e., the bivariate conditional
luminosity function), can be characterized as a function of galaxy mass and
redshift through the cross-correlation between deep, near-infrared maps of the
EBL and galaxy distributions. As an example, we consider combining upcoming
SPHEREx maps of the EBL with galaxy samples from Rubin/LSST. We demonstrate
that their cross-correlation over a sky fraction of $f_\mathrm{sky}\sim0.5$ can
constrain the joint SFR indicator distribution at high significance up to
$z\sim2.5$ for mass-complete samples of galaxies down to
$M_{*}\sim10^9\,M_{\odot}$. These constraints not only allow models of
different SFR variability to be distinguished, but also provide unique
opportunities to investigate physical mechanisms that require large number

address this shortcoming, in this paper we study a class of neural ordinary
differential equations that, by design, leave a given manifold invariant, and
characterize their properties by leveraging the controllability properties of
control affine systems. In particular, using a result due to Agrachev and
Caponigro on approximating diffeomorphisms with flows of feedback control

of manifold-constrained neural ODE, whenever a certain controllability

property holds when the neural ODE has limited width in each layer, thus
leveraging the depth of network instead for approximation. We verify our
theoretical findings using numerical experiments on PyTorch for the manifolds
S2 and the 3-dimensional orthogonal group SO(3), which are model manifolds for

of this behaviour. This paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a novel
model capable of generating realistic laughter sequences, given a still
portrait and an audio clip containing laughter. We highlight the failure cases
of traditional facial animation methods and leverage recent advances in
diffusion models to produce convincing laughter videos. We train our model on a

diversity of planetary companions. In many cases, planets orbiting M dwarfs can
be described in remarkable detail. What makes the difference is how deeply we
can characterise the host star. This includes to properly model their
atmospheres, their abundance of metals, and their activity processes. If they
are well described individually, these numerous stars have the potential for
providing statistically robust conclusions when combined into larger samples.
Carmencita is the input catalogue of nearby M dwarfs for the CARMENES project,
which aims to search for potentially habitable Earth-sized planets orbiting
them. It contains more than two thousand M dwarfs that are scrutinized by the
consortium members from multiple angles. This thesis contributes to the
description of each one of these M dwarfs, including astrometry, photometry,
activity, kinematics, and multiplicity, but also to the study of the sample as
a whole. The empirical observations presented in this study provide an
important benchmark for testing and improving theoretical predictions. By
taking a careful, individualized approach to the study of M dwarfs, we not only
contribute to the study of the Universe's physical processes, but we also pave
the way for future discoveries of the potential for life beyond our own planet.
Overall, the findings of this study underscore the importance of continued
research into the most numerous stars and their planetary systems. We expect
that the wealth of data gathered in this thesis will serve as a valuable
resource for astronomers and researchers in related fields, and that it will
inspire further investigations and new insights into the processes that shape
the Universe.

that, in $d>2$ spacetime dimensions, this expectation is always realized at one
loop for arbitrary non-derivative interactions, confirming that the physically
distinct phenomena of nonzero charge density and spontaneous symmetry breaking
occur simultaneously in these systems. We quantify this result by deriving
universal scaling relations for the symmetry breaking scale as a function of
the charge density, at low and high density. Moreover, we show that the
critical value of $\mu$ above which a nonzero density develops coincides with
the pole mass in the unbroken, Poincar\'e invariant vacuum of the theory. The

spacetime with (strain-)gauge field. Prior work considered subleading
corrections written as non-trivial frame and spin connection terms. We
previously argued that such corrections cannot be considered consistently
without taking all the terms at the same order of approximation, which due to
the unconventional power counting originating from the large gauge field,
involve also higher covariant derivative terms. Here we confirm this,
explicitly computing subleading terms. To the order we explore, the theory is
elegantly determined by the gauge field and frame, both given by the hopping
functions, the torsion free spin connection of the frame, together with
coefficients for the higher derivative terms derived from lattice invariants.
For the first time we compute the metric that the Dirac field sees - the
'electrometric' - to quadratic order in the deformation allowing us to describe
the subleading corrections to the dispersion relation for inhomogeneous
deformations originating from corrections to the frame. Focussing on in-plane
inhomogeneous strain, we use a simple model to relate the hopping functions to
the strain field, finding the electrometric becomes curved at this quadratic
order. Thus this lattice model yields an effective 'analog gravity' description
as a curved space Dirac theory, with large magnetic field, and Lorentz
violating higher covariant derivative terms. We check our calculations by a
numerical diagonalization of the lattice model for a periodic armchair
deformation, confirming that frame corrections contribute at the same order as
higher covariant derivative terms.

the existence of an excess of black holes around $20 M_{\odot}$. We assess the

statistical fluctuations, given the small number of events observed so far,

collision region virtually unaffected in an approximately linear fashion. An
experimentally accessible knob to tune between those two scenarios is provided
by the relative phase between the involved wave-packets. This genuinely

off a static impurity, which cannot destroy a topological edge state. Besides

Although rare, these ISOs can be captured into bound orbits around the Sun. In
this study, we investigate the novel idea of capture of ISOs into near-Earth

population of Near Earth Objects (NEOs). Using numerical simulations, we find
that the capture of ISOs into near-Earth orbits is dominated by Jupiter which
is $10^4\times$ more efficient in capturing ISOs. Captures are more likely to
occur for objects with high eccentricities and low inclinations. We also
investigate the stability of captured ISOs and find that they are generally
unstable and survive shorter than known NEOs with a half-life time of $\approx
0.05$ Myr and are ejected from the solar system due to interactions with other

binary black hole systems with large mass ratios, as well as being of formal
interest. At zeroth order in a binary's mass ratio, the smaller body moves on a
geodesic of the larger body's spacetime. Post-geodesic corrections describing
forces driving the small body's worldline away from geodesics must be
incorporated to model the system accurately. An important post-geodesic effect
is the gravitational self-force, which describes the small body's interaction
with its own spacetime curvature. This effect includes the backreaction due to
gravitational-wave emission that leads to the inspiral of the small body into
the black hole. When a spinning body orbits a black hole, its spin couples to
spacetime curvature. This introduces another post-geodesic correction known as
the spin-curvature force. An osculating geodesic integrator that includes both
the backreaction due to gravitational waves and spin-curvature forces can be
used to generate a spinning-body inspiral. In this paper, we use an osculating
geodesic integrator to combine the leading backreaction of gravitational waves
with the spin-curvature force. Our analysis only includes the leading
orbit-averaged dissipative backreaction, and examines the spin-curvature force

examining how to include secondary spin in large-mass-ratio waveform models.

instabilities over a range of masses above extremality. We conjecture that
these instabilities settle down into Grey Galaxies (GGs) - a new class of
coarse-grained solutions to Einstein's equations which we construct in $d=3$.
Grey Galaxies are made up of a black hole with critical angular velocity
$\omega=1$ in the `centre' of $AdS$, surrounded by a large flat disk of thermal
bulk gas that revolves around the centre of $AdS$ at the speed of light. The
gas carries a finite fraction of the total energy, as its parametrically low
energy density and large radius are inversely related. GGs exist at masses that
extend all the way down to the unitarity bound. Their thermodynamics is that of
a weakly interacting mix of Kerr-AdS black holes and the bulk gas. Their
boundary stress tensor is the sum of a smooth `black hole' contribution and a
peaked gas contribution that is delta function localized around the equator of
the boundary sphere in the large $N$ limit. We also construct another class of
solutions with the same charges; `Revolving Black Holes (RBHs)'. RBHs are
macroscopically charged $SO(d,2)$ descendants of AdS-Kerr solutions, and
consist of $\omega=1$ black holes revolving around the centre of $AdS$ at a
fixed radial location but in a quantum wave function in the angular directions.
RBH solutions are marginally entropically subdominant to GG solutions and do
not constitute the endpoint of the superradiant instability. Nonetheless, we
argue that supersymmetric versions of these solutions have interesting
implications for the spectrum of supersymmetric states in, e.g. ${\cal N}=4$
Yang-Mills theory.

promising approach for exploration is to use intrinsic rewards, which often
boils down to estimating ""novelty"" of states, transitions, or trajectories with
deep networks. Prior works have shown that conditional prediction objectives
such as masked autoencoding can be seen as stochastic estimation of
pseudo-likelihood. We show how this perspective naturally leads to a unified
view on existing intrinsic reward approaches: they are special cases of
conditional prediction, where the estimation of novelty can be seen as
pseudo-likelihood estimation with different mask distributions. From this view,
we propose a general framework for deriving intrinsic rewards -- Masked Input
Modeling for Exploration (MIMEx) -- where the mask distribution can be flexibly
tuned to control the difficulty of the underlying conditional prediction task.
We demonstrate that MIMEx can achieve superior results when compared against
competitive baselines on a suite of challenging sparse-reward visuomotor tasks.

$^{56}$Ni $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Co $\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe and uses this to
determine the Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium temperature, excitation and
ionization structure across the nebula. From the physical condition solutions
we generate the emissivities to construct spectra depending on viewing angles.
Our results show large variations in the line profiles with viewing angles, as
diagnosed by the first three moments of the line profiles; shifts, widths, and
skewness. We compare line profiles from different elements, and study the
morphology of line-of-sight slices that determine the flux at each part of a
line profile. We find that excitation conditions can sometimes make the
momentum vector of the ejecta emitting in the excited states significantly
different from that of the bulk of the ejecta of the respective element, thus
giving blueshifted lines for bulk receding material, and vice versa. We compare
the 3.3 $M_\odot$ He-core model to observations of the Type Ib supernova SN

the pure Doppler images to provide a region proposal. Secondly, benefiting from

non-negligible potential renormalisation, quantified by the `reorganisation
energy'. Often, the microscopic system-bath coupling gives rise to a counter
term which adds to the bare Hamiltonian, exactly compensating for such
potential distortion. On the other hand, when describing quantum dissipative
dynamics with weak-coupling master equations, a number of `Lamb-shift terms'
appear which, contrary to popular belief, cannot be neglected. And yet, the
practice of vanishing both the counter term and Lamb-shift contributions is
almost universal; and, surprisingly, it gives excellent results. In this paper
we use a damped quantum harmonic oscillator to analytically show that
subtracting the reorganisation energy from the Hamiltonian and then suppressing
the Lamb-shift terms from the resulting master equation, does indeed yield an
excellent approximation to the exact steady state and long-time dynamics. Put
differently, those seemingly unjustified steps succeed at building the
asymptotic mean-force Gibbs state -- or rather, its classical limit -- into the
master equation. This can noticeably increase its accuracy, specially at
moderate-to-low temperatures and even up to intermediate coupling. We thus shed
light on an overlooked issue that becomes critical in the calculation of heat
currents in quantum thermodynamics.

Having reliable uncertainty assessment of the forecast enables tools to be

probabilistic forecasts. First, we extend the parallel partial Gaussian
processes for predicting the one-step-ahead vector-valued transition function
that links the observations between the current and next time points, and
quantify the uncertainty of predictions by posterior sampling. Second, we show
the equivalence between the dynamic mode decomposition and maximum likelihood

connection provides data generating models of dynamic mode decomposition and
thus, the uncertainty of the predictions can be obtained. Third, we draw close
connections between data-driven models of nonlinear dynamical systems, such as
proper orthogonal decomposition, dynamic mode decomposition and parallel
partial Gaussian processes, through a unified view of data generating models.
We study two numerical examples, where the inputs of the dynamics are assumed
to be known in the first example and the inputs are unknown in the second

the Standard Model particles and remain hidden. We study a type of hidden dark
matter model in which the dark matter is completely decoupled from the Standard
Model sector except gravitationally, and consists of a single species with a
conserved comoving particle number. This category of hidden dark matter
includes models that act as warm dark matter but is more general. In
particular, in addition to having an independent temperature from the Standard
Model sector, it includes cases in which dark matter is in its own thermal
equilibrium or is free-streaming, obeys fermionic or bosonic statistics, and
processes a chemical potential that controls the particle occupation number.
While the usual parameterization using the free-streaming scale or the particle
mass no longer applies, we show that all cases can be well approximated by a
set of functions parameterized by only one parameter as long as the chemical
potential is nonpositive: the characteristic scale factor at the time of the
relativistic-to-nonrelativistic transition. We study the constraints from Big
Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, the Lyman-$\alpha$
forest, and the smallest halo mass. We show that the most significant
phenomenological impact is the suppression of the small-scale matter power
spectrum -- a typical feature when the dark matter has a velocity dispersion or
pressure at early times. So far, small dark matter halos provide the strongest
constraint, limiting the transition scale factor to be no larger than
$\sim1.4\times10^{-4}$ times the scale factor at matter-radiation equality.

practically (and theoretically) meaningful is challenging. In this paper, I
follow the procedure outlined in Anvari & Lakens (2021) to determine the
smallest subjectively experienced difference in VisAWI-s ratings using an
anchor-based method. A sample of N = 249 participants rated and compared
screenshots of eight websites in an online survey. I determined an estimate of
a population-specific mean difference of 0.4, or in POMP units 6.58%, which
translates to a mean difference of 0.46 with the 7-point Likert-type scale of
the VisAWI-s. These values suggest that differences in VisAWI-s scores
exceeding these estimates, such as the 0.5 mentioned above, are likely
noticeable and meaningful to users. However, the estimate of this smallest
subjectively experienced difference is affected by the overall visual
aesthetics rating of the stimuli used. Researchers can use this effect size to
inform study design and sample size planning. Still, whenever possible, they
should aim to determine a domain- and research-design-specific smallest effect

indoor regions by a swarm of flying, energy constrained agents. The agents,
which are identical, autonomous, anonymous and oblivious, uniformly cover the
region and thus explore it using predefined action rules based on locally
sensed information and the energy level of the agents. While flying drones have
many advantages in search and rescue scenarios, their main drawback is a high
power consumption during flight combined with limited, on-board energy.
Furthermore, in these scenarios agent size is severely limited and consequently
so are the total weight and capabilities of the agents. The region is modeled
as a connected sub-set of a regular grid composed of square cells that the
agents enter, over time, via entry points. Some of the agents may settle in
unoccupied cells as the exploration progresses. Settled agents conserve energy
and become virtual pheromones for the exploration and coverage process, beacons
that subsequently aid the remaining, and still exploring, mobile agents. The
termination of the coverage process is based on a backward propagating
information diffusion scheme. Various algorithmical alternatives are discussed
and upper bounds derived and compared to experimental results. Finally, an
optimal entry rate that minimizes the total energy consumption is derived for
the case of a linear regions.

resolution and dynamic range, which can eliminate the issue of blurred RGB
images during fast movements. This unique strength holds a potential for
accurate pose estimation of agile-legged robots, which has been a challenging
problem to tackle. Our framework leverages the benefits of both RGB-D and event
cameras to achieve robust and accurate pose estimation, even during dynamic
maneuvers such as jumping and landing a quadruped robot, the Mini-Cheetah. Our
major contributions are threefold: Firstly, we introduce an adaptive time
surface (ATS) method that addresses the whiteout and blackout issue in
conventional time surfaces by formulating pixel-wise decay rates based on scene
complexity and motion speed. Secondly, we develop an effective pixel selection
method that directly samples from event data and applies sample filtering
through ATS, enabling us to pick pixels on distinct features. Lastly, we
propose a nonlinear pose optimization formula that simultaneously performs
3D-2D alignment on both RGB-based and event-based maps and images, allowing the
algorithm to fully exploit the benefits of both data streams. We extensively
evaluate the performance of our framework on both public datasets and our own
quadruped robot dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately
estimating the pose of agile robots during dynamic movements.

However, todays PV battery systems do not yet fully meet this requirement.
Especially batteries still prove to be a hindrance, as they represent the most
expensive and fastest aging component in a PV battery system. This work aims to
address this by prolonging battery life. For this purpose, a forecast-based
charging strategy was developed. As lithium-ion batteries age slower in a low
state of charge, the goal of the operation strategy is to only charge the
battery as much as needed. The impact of the proposed charging strategy is
examined in a case study using one year of historical data of 14 standalone
systems in Nigeria. It was found that the proposed operation strategy could
reduce the average battery state of charge by around 20 percent without causing
power outages for the mini-grids. This would significantly extend the life of
the battery and ultimately lead to a more durable and cheaper operation of
standalone PV battery systems.

periodic polymers due to their delocalization, large group velocity because of
covalent bonding and large energy quantum compared to that for acoustic
phonons, as it was observed in a number of recent measurements in different
oligomers. However, this transport is dramatically sensitive to anharmonic
interactions, including the unavoidable interaction with acoustic phonons
responsible for the transport decoherence, suppressing ballistic transport at
long distances. Here we show that this decoherence is substantially suppressed
if the group velocity of optical phonons is less than the sound velocity of
acoustic phonons; otherwise ballistic transport is substantially suppressed by
a Cherenkov's like emission of acoustic phonons. This conclusion is justified
considering energy and momentum conservation during phonon absorption or

2010-2019 and 2022 using a dataset of roughly 1 million geotagged tweets
containing the substring ``homeless.'' Correlations between
homelessness-related tweet counts and ranked per capita homelessness volume,
but not general-population densities, suggest a relationship between the
likelihood of Twitter users to personally encounter or observe homelessness in
their everyday lives and their likelihood to communicate about it online. An
increase to the log-odds of ``homeless'' appearing in an English-language
tweet, as well as an acceleration in the increase in average tweet sentiment,
suggest that tweets about homelessness are also affected by trends at the
nation-scale. Additionally, changes to the lexical content of tweets over time
suggest that reversals to the polarity of national or state-level trends may be
detectable through an increase in political or service-sector language over the
semantics of charity or direct appeals. An analysis of user account type also
revealed changes to Twitter-use patterns by accounts authored by individuals
versus entities that may provide an additional signal to confirm changes to
homelessness density in a given jurisdiction. While a computational approach to
social media analysis may provide a low-cost, real-time dataset rich with
information about nationwide and localized impacts of homelessness and
homelessness policy, we find that practical issues abound, limiting the
potential of social media as a proxy to complement other measures of

performance in a variety of applications in high energy and nuclear physics.
However, it remains unclear in many cases which aspects of jets give rise to
this discriminating power, and whether jet observables that are tractable in
perturbative QCD such as those obeying infrared-collinear (IRC) safety serve as
sufficient inputs. In this article, we introduce a new classifier, Jet Flow
Networks (JFNs), in an effort to address the question of whether IRC unsafe
information provides additional discriminating power in jet classification.
JFNs are permutation-invariant neural networks (deep sets) that take as input
the kinematic information of reconstructed subjets. The subjet radius serves as
a tunable hyperparameter, enabling the sensitivity to soft emissions and
nonperturbative effects to be gradually increased as the subjet radius is
decreased. We demonstrate the performance of JFNs for quark vs. gluon and QCD
vs. $Z$ jet tagging. For small subjet radii, the performance of JFNs is
equivalent to the IRC-unsafe Particle Flow Networks (PFNs), demonstrating that
infrared-collinear unsafe information is not necessary to achieve strong
discrimination for both cases. As the subjet radius is increased, the
performance of the JFNs remains essentially unchanged until physical thresholds
that we identify are crossed. For relatively large subjet radii, we show that
the JFNs may offer an increased model independence with a modest tradeoff in
performance compared to classifiers that use the full particle information of
the jet. These results shed new light onto how machines learn patterns in

information geometry and asymptotic statistics. In practice, it is widely used
to quickly estimate the expected information available in a data set and guide
experimental design choices. In many modern applications, it is intractable to
analytically compute the Fisher information and Monte Carlo methods are used
instead. The standard Monte Carlo method produces estimates of the Fisher
information that can be biased when the Monte-Carlo noise is non-negligible.
Most problematic is noise in the derivatives as this leads to an overestimation
of the available constraining power, given by the inverse Fisher information.
In this work we find another simple estimate that is oppositely biased and
produces an underestimate of the constraining power. This estimator can either
be used to give approximate bounds on the parameter constraints or can be
combined with the standard estimator to give improved, approximately unbiased
estimates. Both the alternative and the combined estimators are asymptotically
unbiased so can be also used as a convergence check of the standard approach.
We discuss potential limitations of these estimators and provide methods to
assess their reliability. These methods accelerate the convergence of Fisher
forecasts, as unbiased estimates can be achieved with fewer Monte Carlo
samples, and so can be used to reduce the simulated data set size by several
orders of magnitude.

methods focus on discriminative Gaussian denoisers. Although diffusion models

Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) during inference. This paper proposes
DiffPIR, which integrates the traditional plug-and-play method into the

finite population quantity but with much smaller variance. We begin with a
relatively simple problem in which the population is assumed to be homogeneous
and there are no common units in the ps and the nps. We assume that there are
covariates and responses for everyone in the two samples, and there are no
covariates available for the nonsampled units. We use the nps (ps) to construct
a prior for the ps (nps). We also introduce partial discounting to avoid a
dominance of the prior. We use Bayesian predictive inference for the finite
population mean. In our illustrative example on body mass index and our

microstructure optimization can be readily achieved by lab scale methods, the
transfer from laboratory scale to a pilot production line ('lab to fab') is a
slow and cumbersome process. Here, we show how we can optimize the performance
of organic solar cells and at the same time assess process performance in a 2D
combinatorial approach directly on an industrially relevant slot die coating
line. This is enabled by a multi-nozzle slot die coating head allowing
parameter variations along and across the web. This modification allows us to
generate and analyze 3750 devices in a single coating run, varying the active
layer donor:acceptor ratio and the thickness of the electron transport layer
(ETL). We use Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to exploit the whole dataset
for precise determination of the optimal parameter combination.
Performance-relevant features of the active layer morphology are inferred from
UV-Vis absorption spectra. By mapping morphology in this way, small undesired
gradients of process conditions (extrusion rates, annealing temperatures) are
detected and their effect on device performance is quantified. The correlation
between process parameters, morphology and performance obtained by GPR provides
hints to the underlying physics, which are finally quantified by automated
high-throughput drift-diffusion simulations. This leads to the conclusion that
voltage losses which are observed for very thin ETL coatings are due to
incomplete coverage of the electrode by the ETL, which cause enhanced surface
recombination.

with astrophysical models of stellar angular momentum changes, although the
data point to a subpopulation of stars with slower initial rotations than

dependency of X-ray activity on rotation, as reported by Argiroffi et al.
(2016), but this result is not confidently confirmed. Both X-ray luminosity and
star spot area decrease approximately as t^{-1} for solar mass stars suggesting
that spot magnetic fields are roughly constant and l-PMS stars follow the
universal solar-scaling law between the X-ray luminosity and surface magnetic
flux. Assuming convective dynamos are dominant, theoretical magnetic fluxes
fail to reveal the universal law for l-PMS stars that enter late Henyey tracks.

outperforms a passive phased array in terms of spectral and energy efficiency
due to high component loss from a high-resolution passive phase shifter. While
the DMA provides lower spectral efficiency results than the active phased

ChatGPT and DALL-E, in real-world applications necessitates vast,
domain-specific, and publicly accessible datasets. Unfortunately, the scarcity
of such datasets poses a significant challenge for researchers aiming to apply
these breakthroughs in engineering design. Synthetic datasets emerge as a
viable alternative. However, practitioners are often uncertain about generating
high-quality datasets that accurately represent real-world data and are
suitable for the intended downstream applications. This study aims to fill this
knowledge gap by proposing comprehensive guidelines for generating, annotating,
and validating synthetic datasets. The trade-offs and methods associated with
each of these aspects are elaborated upon. Further, the practical implications
of these guidelines are illustrated through the creation of a turbo-compressors
dataset. The study underscores the importance of thoughtful sampling methods to
ensure the appropriate size, diversity, utility, and realism of a dataset. It
also highlights that design diversity does not equate to performance diversity
or realism. By employing test sets that represent uniform, real, or
task-specific samples, the influence of sample size and sampling strategy is
scrutinized. Overall, this paper offers valuable insights for researchers
intending to create and publish synthetic datasets for engineering design,
thereby paving the way for more effective applications of AI advancements in
the field. The code and data for the dataset and methods are made publicly

We first present a thermodynamically-consistent and reduction-consistent phase
field model for two-phase dielectric fluids. The model honors the conservation
laws and thermodynamic principles, and has the property that, if only one fluid
component is present in the system, the two-phase formulation will exactly
reduce to that of the corresponding single-phase system. In particular, this
model accommodates an equilibrium solution that is compatible with the
zero-velocity requirement based on physics. This property provides a simpler
method for simulating the equilibrium state of two-phase dielectric systems. We
further present an efficient numerical algorithm, together with a
spectral-element (for two dimensions) or a hybrid
Fourier-spectral/spectral-element (for three dimensions) discretization in
space, for simulating this class of problems. This algorithm computes different
dynamic variables successively in an un-coupled fashion, and involves only
coefficient matrices that are time-independent in the resultant linear
algebraic systems upon discretization, even when the physical properties (e.g.
permittivity, density, viscosity) of the two dielectric fluids are different.
This property is crucial and enables us to employ fast Fourier transforms for
three-dimensional problems. Ample numerical simulations of two-phase dielectric
flows under imposed voltage are presented to demonstrate the performance of the
method herein and to compare the simulation results with theoretical models and
experimental data.

Studying these sub-structures provides important information about their

star-forming clumps in an HST/F160W$\leq 25$ AB mag sample of 6767 galaxies at

low-pass band filter in Fourier space to reconstruct the background image of a
galaxy and detect small-scale features (clumps) on the background-subtracted
image. Clumpy galaxies are defined as those having at least one off-center
clump that contributes a minimum of 10$\%$ of the galaxy's total rest-frame UV
flux. We measure the fraction of clumpy galaxies ($\rm f_{clumpy}$) as a
function of stellar mass, redshift, and galaxy environment. Our results
indicate that $\rm f_{clumpy}$ increases with redshift, reaching $\sim 65\%$ at
$z\sim 1.5$. We also find that $\rm f_{clumpy}$ in low-mass galaxies ($\rm
9.5\leq log(M_*/M_\odot)\leq 10$) is 10$\%$ higher compared to that of their
high-mass counterparts ($\rm log(M_*/M_\odot)>10.5$). Moreover, we find no
evidence of significant environmental dependence of $\rm f_{clumpy}$ for
galaxies at the redshift range of this study. Our results suggest that the
fragmentation of gas clouds under violent disk instability remains the primary
driving mechanism for clump formation, and incidents common in dense
environments, such as mergers, are not the dominant processes.

model with impressive results. They require O(n log n) computational complexity
and O(n) relative positional encoder (RPE) multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and
decay bias calls. We aim to reduce both. We first note that the RPE is a
non-SPD (symmetric positive definite) kernel and the Toeplitz matrices are
pseudo-Gram matrices. Further 1) the learned kernels display spiky behavior
near the main diagonals with otherwise smooth behavior; 2) the RPE MLP is slow.
For bidirectional models, this motivates a sparse plus low-rank Toeplitz matrix
decomposition. For the sparse component's action, we do a small 1D convolution.
For the low rank component, we replace the RPE MLP with linear interpolation
and use asymmetric Structured Kernel Interpolation (SKI) (Wilson et. al. 2015)
for O(n) complexity: we provide rigorous error analysis. For causal models,
""fast"" causal masking (Katharopoulos et. al. 2020) negates SKI's benefits.
Working in the frequency domain, we avoid an explicit decay bias. To enforce
causality, we represent the kernel via the real part of its frequency response
using the RPE and compute the imaginary part via a Hilbert transform. This
maintains O(n log n) complexity but achieves an absolute speedup. Modeling the
frequency response directly is also competitive for bidirectional training,
using one fewer FFT. We set a speed state of the art on Long Range Arena (Tay

fundamental tradeoff by combining (1) a coupled operations log that permits
tight integration of a PMEM-specialized user-level replication stack with a
PMEM-based persistence stack, and (2) explicit control over the commutativity
among concurrent operations. We demonstrate the generality and potential of
Blizzard with three illustrative applications with very different data

Moreover, this anisotropic process was implemented with atmospheric dry etching
(ADE) technology. The nature of the anisotropy is that the etching in the (111)
direction of the Si surface is significantly slower than that in the (100) and
(110) directions. Using DFT (density functional theory) simulations, we
performed quantum chemistry modelling of the reaction pathways determining the
rates of the etching caused by F2 dissociative chemisorption and subsequent
Si-Si bond breaking. Dangling bonds on the surface Si atoms were passivated
with fluorine. A charge density analysis indicates that F atoms attracts
electron density from the Si atoms giving them a positive charge, whereas the
neighboring Si atoms unpassivated with fluorine have a negative charge. The
amount of positive charge increases with the number of F atoms bonded with
silicon. Si(100) and Si(110) incorporate a larger number of fluorine atoms than
Si(111) resulting in the Si-Si bonds on these surfaces have a larger amount of

tractography procedure and train agents to reconstruct the structure of the
white matter without manually curated reference streamlines. While the
performances reported were competitive, the proposed framework is complex, and
little is still known about the role and impact of its multiple parts. In this
work, we thoroughly explore the different components of the proposed framework,
such as the choice of the RL algorithm, seeding strategy, the input signal and
reward function, and shed light on their impact. Approximately 7,400 models
were trained for this work, totalling nearly 41,000 hours of GPU time. Our goal
is to guide researchers eager to explore the possibilities of deep RL for
tractography by exposing what works and what does not work with the category of
approach. As such, we ultimately propose a series of recommendations concerning
the choice of RL algorithm, the input to the agents, the reward function and
more to help future work using reinforcement learning for tractography. We also
release the open source codebase, trained models, and datasets for users and

learning framework where a server aggregates models updated by multiple devices
without accessing their private datasets. Hierarchical FL (HFL), as a
device-edge-cloud aggregation hierarchy, can enjoy both the cloud server's
access to more datasets and the edge servers' efficient communications with
devices. However, the learning latency increases with the HFL network scale due
to the increasing number of edge servers and devices with limited local
computation capability and communication bandwidth. To address this issue, in
this paper, we introduce model pruning for HFL in wireless networks to reduce
the neural network scale. We present the convergence analysis of an upper on
the l2 norm of gradients for HFL with model pruning, analyze the computation
and communication latency of the proposed model pruning scheme, and formulate
an optimization problem to maximize the convergence rate under a given latency
threshold by jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and wireless resource
allocation. By decoupling the optimization problem and using Karush Kuhn Tucker
(KKT) conditions, closed-form solutions of pruning ratio and wireless resource
allocation are derived. Simulation results show that our proposed HFL with
model pruning achieves similar learning accuracy compared with the HFL without
model pruning and reduces about 50 percent communication cost.

significant for the next-generation quantum networks as it coordinates the
production, management, control, and sharing of quantum information across the

software is abstracted and modularized as an open-source QISP framework. To
verify and characterize the QISP's performance, we demonstrate multi-channel
entanglement distribution and routing among multiple quantum-network nodes with
a time-energy entangled-photon source. We further perform field tests of
concurrent services for multiple users across the quantum-network testbed. Our

is designed to serve as a surrogate model for predicting future reservoir

linear representations of non-linear dynamical systems. However, existing
data-driven applications of Koopman operator theory, including both traditional
and deep learning approaches, perform poorly on non-linear network dynamics
problems as they do not address the underlying geometric structure. In this
paper we present a novel approach based on Koopman operator theory and message
passing networks that finds a linear representation for the dynamical system
which is globally valid at any time step. The linearisations found by our
method produce predictions on a suite of network dynamics problems that are
several orders of magnitude better than current state-of-the-art techniques. We
also apply our approach to the highly non-linear training dynamics of neural
network architectures, and obtain linear representations which can generate
network parameters with comparable performance to networks trained by classical

concepts with only a few labeled samples of data. Recent works based on
metric-learning approaches leverage the meta-learning approach, which is
encompassed by episodic tasks that make use a support (training) and query set
(test) with the objective of learning a similarity comparison metric between
those sets. Due to the lack of data, the learning process of the embedding
network becomes an important part of the few-shot task. Previous works have
addressed this problem using metric learning approaches, but the properties of
the underlying latent space and the separability of the difference classes on
it was not entirely enforced. In this work, we propose two different loss
functions which consider the importance of the embedding vectors by looking at
the intra-class and inter-class distance between the few data. The first loss
function is the Proto-Triplet Loss, which is based on the original triplet loss
with the modifications needed to better work on few-shot scenarios. The second
loss function, which we dub ICNN loss is based on an inter and intra class
nearest neighbors score, which help us to assess the quality of embeddings
obtained from the trained network. Our results, obtained from a extensive
experimental setup show a significant improvement in accuracy in the
miniImagenNet benchmark compared to other metric-based few-shot learning
methods by a margin of 2%, demonstrating the capability of these loss functions
to allow the network to generalize better to previously unseen classes. In our
experiments, we demonstrate competitive generalization capabilities to other
domains, such as the Caltech CUB, Dogs and Cars datasets compared with the

domain and apply it to density estimation/approximation for data or the
solutions of PDEs such as the Fokker-Planck equation and the Keller-Segel
equation. Similar to KRnet, the structure of B-KRnet adapts the triangular form
of the Knothe-Rosenblatt rearrangement into a normalizing flow model. The main
difference between B-KRnet and KRnet is that B-KRnet is defined on a hypercube
while KRnet is defined on the whole space, in other words, we introduce a new
mechanism in B-KRnet to maintain the exact invertibility. Using B-KRnet as a
transport map, we obtain an explicit probability density function (PDF) model
that corresponds to the pushforward of a prior (uniform) distribution on the
hypercube. To approximate PDFs defined on a bounded computational domain,
B-KRnet is more effective than KRnet. By coupling KRnet and B-KRnet, we can
also define a deep generative model on a high-dimensional domain where some
dimensions are bounded and other dimensions are unbounded. A typical case is
the solution of the stationary kinetic Fokker-Planck equation, which is a PDF
of position and momentum. Based on B-KRnet, we develop an adaptive learning
approach to approximate partial differential equations whose solutions are PDFs
or can be regarded as a PDF. In addition, we apply B-KRnet to density
estimation when only data are available. A variety of numerical experiments is
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of B-KRnet.

i.i.d. from a distribution, but the seller does not know this distribution; the
seller only knows the support $[a,b]$. To be robust against the lack of
knowledge of the environment and buyers' behavior, the seller optimizes over
DSIC mechanisms, and measures the worst-case performance relative to an oracle
with complete knowledge of buyers' valuations. Our analysis encompasses both
the regret and the ratio objectives.
  For these objectives, we derive an optimal mechanism in closed form as a
function of the support and the number of buyers $n$. Our analysis reveals
three regimes of support information and a new class of robust mechanisms. i.)
With ""low"" support information, the optimal mechanism is a second-price auction
(SPA) with a random reserve, a focal class in the earlier literature. ii.) With
""high"" support information, we show that second-price auctions are strictly
suboptimal, and an optimal mechanism belongs to a novel class of mechanisms we
introduce, which we call $\textbf{pooling auctions}$ (POOL); whenever the
highest value is above a threshold, the mechanism still allocates to the
highest bidder, but otherwise the mechanism allocates to a uniformly random
buyer, i.e., pools low types. iii.) With ""moderate"" support information, a
randomization between SPA and POOL is optimal.
  We also characterize optimal mechanisms within nested central subclasses of
mechanisms: standard mechanisms (only allocate to the highest bidder), SPA with
random reserve, and SPA with no reserve. We show strict separations across
classes, implying that deviating from standard mechanisms is necessary for
robustness. Lastly, we show that the same results hold under other distribution
classes that capture ""positive dependence"" (mixture of i.i.d., exchangeable and
affiliated), as well as i.i.d. regular distributions.

skin tone categories, have unclear annotation procedures, and provide
inadequate analyses of uncertainty. In addition, little attention is paid to
the positionality of the humans involved in the annotation process--both

annotation through a series of annotation experiments using the Monk Skin Tone

reliably annotate skin tone in a way that aligns with an expert in the MST

that annotators from different geographic regions rely on different mental

potential that has the mathematical form of the Higgs potential is the specific
cosmology and potential addressed in this work. These templates, based on the
physics of the cosmology and potential are intended to replace the
parameterizations currently used to determine the likelihoods of dynamical
cosmologies. Acknowledging that, unlike {\Lambda}CDM, the evolutions are
dependent on both the specific cosmology and the dark energy potential the
templates are referred to as Specific Cosmology and Potential, SCP, templates.
The requirements set for the SCP templates are that they must be accurate,
analytic functions of an observable such as the scale factor or redshift. This
is achieved through the utilization of a modified beta function formalism that
is based on a physically motivated dark energy potential to calculate the beta
function. The methodology developed here is designed to be adaptable to other
cosmologies and dark energy potentials. The SCP templates are essential tools
in determining the relative likelihoods of a range of dynamical cosmologies and
potentials. An ultimate purpose is the determination whether dark energy is
dynamical or static in a quantitative manner. It is suggested that the SCP
templates calculated in this work can serve as fiducial dynamical templates in
the same manner as {\Lambda}CDM serves for static dark energy.

Neural code generation models perform significantly better on ML tasks than on

topology and edge weights of weighted graphs. Differently, we are interested in
generating edge weights that are realistic in a macroscopic scope, merely from
the topology, which is unexplored and challenging. To this end, we explore and
exploit the patterns involving edge weights and topology in real-world graphs.
Specifically, we divide each graph into layers where each layer consists of the
edges with weights at least a threshold. We observe consistent and surprising
patterns appearing in multiple layers: the similarity between being adjacent
and having high weights, and the nearly-linear growth of the fraction of edges
having high weights with the number of common neighbors. We also observe a
power-law pattern that connects the layers. Based on the observations, we
propose PEAR, an algorithm assigning realistic edge weights to a given

DMI decreases from 0.267 mJ/m2 to 0.011 mJ/m2 with non-linear tendencies as Cu

topic of network analysis, due to its effectiveness to support various graph

sources share consistent latent features but may ignore the possible
inconsistency among them, lacking the required robustness. To address these

from a view of graph reweighting, where each information source is formulated
as a corresponding auxiliary graph, enabling AHGR to integrate arbitrary
available information sources. Moreover, a new transition relation among the
reweighted graphs is then introduced to perceive and resist the possible
inconsistency among multiple sources, enhancing the robustness of AHGR. We
verify the effectiveness of AHGR on a series of synthetic and real attributed
graphs, where it presents superior performance over other baselines.

There is still however an open area of investigation into guiding a neural

importance as it proposes to discover the different latent factors of variation

them into structurally disjoint latent representations. Without additional
constraints or inductive biases placed in the network, a generative model may

while subjected to a gravitational force from the disc that changes its orbital
elements. Usually, that force is considered to arise from the Lindblad and
corotation resonances with the embryo. However, more important contributions
exist for low-mass planets. Radiative thermal diffusion in the vicinity of
embryos yields an additional contribution to the disc's force that damps the
eccentricity and inclination much more vigorously than the resonant interaction
with the disc, and that in general induces fast inward migration. In addition,
the irradiation of the disc by a hot embryo gives rise to an additional
contribution that excites eccentricity and inclination, and induces outward
migration. Which of the two contributions dominates depends on the embryo's
luminosity. We assess the importance of these contributions (termed thermal
forces) on the dynamics and growth of a set of pebble-accreting embryos
initially of Martian mass, by means of N-body simulations that include analytic
expressions for the disc's force. We find very different outcomes for the
embryos subjected to thermal forces and those subjected only to resonant
forces. Importantly, we find that the median final mass of the embryos
subjected to thermal forces is nearly independent of the metallicity, whereas
this mass roughly scales with the metallicity when they are subjected only to
resonant forces. These results can be explained by the strong damping of
eccentricity and inclination at low metallicity, which enhances the embryos'
accretion efficiency.

Therefore, recent literature has focused on using smooth approximations of

  Byzantine Faults",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crash fault tolerant (CFT) consensus algorithms are commonly used in
scenarios where system components are trusted, such as enterprise settings. CFT
algorithms offer high throughput and low latency, making them an attractive
option for centralized operations that require fault tolerance. However, CFT
consensus is vulnerable to Byzantine faults, which can be introduced by a
single corrupt component. Such faults can break consensus in the system.
Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) consensus algorithms withstand Byzantine faults,
but they are not as competitive with CFT algorithms in terms of performance. In
this work, we explore a middle ground between BFT and CFT consensus by
exploring the role of accountability in CFT protocols. That is, if a CFT
protocol node breaks protocol and affects consensus safety, we aim to identify
which node was the culprit. Based on Raft, one of the most popular CFT
algorithms, we present Raft-Forensics, which provides accountability over
Byzantine faults. We theoretically prove that if two honest components fail to
reach consensus, the Raft-Forensics auditing algorithm finds the adversarial
component that caused the inconsistency. In an empirical evaluation, we
demonstrate that Raft-Forensics performs similarly to Raft and significantly
better than state-of-the-art BFT algorithms. With 256 byte messages,
Raft-Forensics achieves peak throughput 87.8% of vanilla Raft at 46% higher
latency, while state-of-the-art BFT protocol Dumbo-NG only achieves 18.9% peak
throughput at nearly $6\times$ higher latency.

TL techniques to estimate average causal effect (ACE) have been focused on the
heterogeneous covariate space setting, those methods are inadequate for
tackling the TCL problem since their algorithm designs are based on the

issue, we propose a generic framework called $\ell_1$-TCL, which incorporates
$\ell_1$ regularized TL for nuisance parameter estimation and downstream
plug-in ACE estimators, including outcome regression, inverse probability
weighted, and doubly robust estimators. Most importantly, with the help of
Lasso for high-dimensional regression, we establish non-asymptotic recovery
guarantees for the generalized linear model (GLM) under the sparsity assumption
for the proposed $\ell_1$-TCL. From an empirical perspective, $\ell_1$-TCL is a
generic learning framework that can incorporate not only GLM but also many
recently developed non-parametric methods, which can enhance robustness to
model mis-specification. We demonstrate this empirical benefit through
extensive numerical simulation by incorporating both GLM and recent neural
network-based approaches in $\ell_1$-TCL, which shows improved performance
compared with existing TL approaches for ACE estimation. Furthermore, our
$\ell_1$-TCL framework is subsequently applied to a real study, revealing that
vasopressor therapy could prevent 28-day mortality within septic patients,

uncertainty of $\sim$9.4 per cent. Our analysis reveals that the ages of high-O

with $\alpha$-enhanced models, resulting in a mean fractional age difference of
-5.3 per cent at [O/$\alpha$] = 0.2 and -11.0 per cent at [O/$\alpha$] = 0.4.
This age difference significantly impacts the age distribution of thick disc

from 8 Gyr to 14 Gyr, indicating a shorter formation time-scale and a faster
chemical-enhanced history for these populations. We confirm the V-shape of the

stars, which is presumably a consequence of the second gas infall.
Additionally, we find that the halo stars in our sample can be divided into two
sequences, a metal-rich sequence (Splash stars) and a metal-poor sequence
(accreted stars), with the Splash stars predominantly older than 9 Gyr and the
accreted halo stars older than 10 Gyr. Finally, we observe two distinct

excited by applying a microwave voltage to a ferromagnetic metal will be
applicable not only to a new magnetization switching method but also to
bio-inspired computing. It should be, however, noted that a phase of the
parametric magnetization oscillation is not uniquely locked, related to the
fact that a frequency of the microwave voltage is twice the value of the
magnetization oscillation. There are two possible phases in the parametric
oscillation state, and which of the two is realized depends on the initial
condition of the magnetization. Here, we examine two approaches to lock the
phase uniquely. One is to suppress the distribution of the initial state by
enhancing the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy before applying microwave
voltage, and the other is to use a sweeping frequency. Through numerical
simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and quantification of locked
rate, we find that the sweeping frequency is more effective to lock the phase
of the parametric magnetization oscillation.

the properties of such polytopes is of fundamental importance for the research
and development of neural networks. So far, either theoretical or empirical
studies on polytopes only stay at the level of counting their number, which is
far from a complete characterization of polytopes. To upgrade the
characterization to a new level, here we propose to study the shapes of
polytopes via the number of simplices obtained by triangulating the polytope.
Then, by computing and analyzing the histogram of simplices across polytopes,
we find that a ReLU network has relatively simple polytopes under both
initialization and gradient descent, although these polytopes theoretically can
be rather diverse and complicated. This finding can be appreciated as a novel
implicit bias. Next, we use nontrivial combinatorial derivation to
theoretically explain why adding depth does not create a more complicated
polytope by bounding the average number of faces of polytopes with a function
of the dimensionality. Our results concretely reveal what kind of simple
functions a network learns and its space partition property. Also, by
characterizing the shape of polytopes, the number of simplices be a leverage
for other problems, \textit{e.g.}, serving as a generic functional complexity

Furthermore, we introduce a full-permutation multi-task learning to alleviate
the spurious causal relations from intermediate sequences to the target, which
results from exposure bias. The Minimum Bayes Risk decoding algorithm is used
to pick the best candidate translation from all permutations to further improve
the performance. Experiments show that the introduced intermediate signals can

space and time scales. Thus entailing large grids and small time steps,
simulations of these flows on CPU-based clusters can thus take several
wall-clock days. Offloading the compute kernels to GPUs appears attractive but
is memory-bound for standard finite-volume and -difference methods, damping
speed-ups. Even when realized, faster GPU-based kernels lead to more intrusive
communication and I/O times. We present a portable strategy for GPU
acceleration of multiphase compressible flow solvers that addresses these
challenges and obtains large speedups at scale. We use OpenACC for portable
offloading of all compute kernels while maintaining low-level control when
needed. An established Fortran preprocessor and metaprogramming tool, Fypp,
enables otherwise hidden compile-time optimizations. This strategy exposes
compile-time optimizations and high memory reuse while retaining readable,
maintainable, and compact code. Remote direct memory access, realized via
CUDA-aware MPI, reduces communication times. We implement this approach in the
open-source solver MFC. Metaprogramming-based preprocessing results in an
8-times speedup of the most expensive kernels, 46% of peak FLOPs on NVIDIA
GPUs, and high arithmetic intensity (about 10 FLOPs/byte). In representative
simulations, a single A100 GPU is 300-times faster than an Intel Xeon CPU core,
corresponding to a 9-times speedup for a single A100 compared to the entire CPU
die. At the same time, near-ideal (97%) weak scaling is observed for at least
13824 GPUs on Summit. A strong scaling efficiency of 84% is retained for an
8-times increase in GPU count. Collective I/O, implemented via MPI3, helps
ensure negligible contribution of data transfers. Large many-GPU simulations of

matter-dominated, and vacuum (energy) dominated universes. We show that the
rate of change of the scale factor in all three situations is modified by the
non-commutativity of the space-time, and this rate depends on the sign of the
deformation parameter, indicating a possible explanation for the observed
Hubble tension. We undertake this investigation for two different realizations
of non-commutative space-time coordinates. In both cases, we also show the

flexible adaptability to different users channels. Experiments present the

ratio, isotropic elasticity, and bio-inspired design principles.
Notwithstanding, extant stochastic structures are predominantly generated via
procedural modeling techniques, which present notable difficulties in
representing geometric microstructures with periodic boundaries, thereby
leading to intricate simulations and computational overhead. In this
manuscript, we introduce an innovative method for designing stochastic
microstructures that guarantees the periodicity of each microstructure unit to
facilitate homogenization. We conceptualize each pore and the interconnecting
tunnel between proximate pores as Gaussian kernels and leverage a modified
version of the minimum spanning tree technique to assure pore connectivity. We
harness the dart-throwing strategy to stochastically produce pore locations,
tailoring the distribution law to enforce boundary periodicity. We subsequently
employ the level-set technique to extract the stochastic microstructures.
Conclusively, we adopt Wang tile rules to amplify the stochasticity at the
boundary of the microstructure unit, concurrently preserving periodicity
constraints among units. Our methodology offers facile parametric control of
the designed stochastic microstructures. Experimental outcomes on 3D models
manifest the superior isotropy and energy absorption performance of the
stochastic porous microstructures. We further corroborate the efficacy of our
modeling strategy through simulations of mechanical properties and empirical

analyzed inductive bias by training models with a few synthetic data and
comparing the model's generalization with candidate generalization patterns.
However, when examining the output sequence frequency, previous methods cannot

Hayward metric is realized as an exact background metric in the Effective Field
Theory with timelike scalar profile without resorting to special matter field,
such as nonlinear electrodynamics. The fundamental quasinormal mode for axial
graviational perturbations of this black hole has been considered recently with
the help of various methods. Here we make a further step in this direction and
find that, unlike the fundamental mode, a few first overtones deviate from
their Schwarzschild limit at a much higher rate. This outburst of overtones
occurs because the overtones are extremely sensitive to the least change of the
near-horizon geometry. The analytical formula for quasinormal modes is obtained
in the eikonal regime. In addition, we calculated grey-body factors and showed
that regular Hayward black hole with a scalar hair has smaller grey-body factor
than the Schwarzschild one. Integration of the wave-like equation in
time-domain shows that the power-law tails following the ring-down phase at
late times are indistinguishable from the Schwarzschild ones.

  search experiments","51 pages, 14 figures",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The relic density of Dark Matter (DM) in the freeze-in scenario is highly
dependent on the evolution history of the universe and changes significantly in
a non-standard (NS) cosmological framework prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
(BBN). In this scenario, an additional species dominates the energy budget of
the universe at early times (before BBN), resulting in a larger cosmological
expansion rate at a given temperature compared to the standard
radiation-dominated (RD) universe. To investigate the production of DM in the
freeze-in scenario, we consider both standard RD and NS cosmological picture
before BBN and perform a comparative analysis. We extend the Standard Model
(SM) particle content with a SM singlet DM particle $\chi $ and an axion-like
particle (ALP) $a$. The interactions between ALP, SM particles, and DM are
generated by higher dimensional effective operators. This setup allows the
production of DM $\chi$ from SM bath through the mediation of ALP, via
ALP-portal processes. These interactions involve non-renormalizable operators,
leading to ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in, which depends on the reheating
temperature ($T_{RH}$) of the early universe. In the NS cosmological scenario,
the faster expansion rate suppresses the DM production processes, allowing for
enhanced effective couplings between the visible and dark sectors to satisfy
the observed DM abundance compared to RD scenario. This improved coupling
increases the detection prospects for freeze-in DM via the ALP-portal, which is
otherwise challenging to detect in RD universe due to small couplings involved.
Using an effective field theory set-up, we show that various ALP searches such
as in FASER, DUNE, and SHiP, etc. will be able to probe significant parameter
space depending on the different model parameters.

We identify how heterogeneities in each parameter in the model (interaction

through structural factors must account for heterogeneity that is both spatial

the connectivity among different types of amenities along the street network.
Given that existing measures often only focus on these factors individually,
here we develop a simple, principled, and flexible framework to characterize
the directness of accessibility among heterogeneous amenities in a city, which
we call the Class First Passage Difference (CFPD). The CFPD quantifies the
excess travel distance incurred when using the street network to route between
different pairs of amenity types, summarizing both the spatial and topological

statistical associations with a variety of urban prosperity and accessibility

characteristics of cities according to their level of development and

autonomous navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This paper presents a
data-driven aerodynamic force prediction model based on a small number of
pressure sensors located on the surface of UAV. The model is built on a linear
term that can make a reasonably accurate prediction and a nonlinear correction
for accuracy improvement. The linear term is based on a reduced basis
reconstruction of the surface pressure distribution, where the basis is
extracted from numerical simulation data and the basis coefficients are
determined by solving linear pressure reconstruction equations at a set of
sensor locations. Sensor placement is optimized using the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM). Aerodynamic forces are computed by integrating the
reconstructed surface pressure distribution. The nonlinear term is an
artificial neural network (NN) that is trained to bridge the gap between the
ground truth and the DEIM prediction, especially in the scenario where the DEIM
model is constructed from simulation data with limited fidelity. A large
network is not necessary for accurate correction as the linear model already
captures the main dynamics of the surface pressure field, thus yielding an
efficient DEIM+NN aerodynamic force prediction model. The model is tested on
numerical and experimental dynamic stall data of a 2D NACA0015 airfoil, and
numerical simulation data of dynamic stall of a 3D drone. Numerical results
demonstrate that the machine learning enhanced model can make fast and accurate
predictions of aerodynamic forces using only a few pressure sensors, even for
the NACA0015 case in which the simulations do not agree well with the wind

Treatment Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation (TE-CDE) and
structured state space model (S4Model). While TE-CDE uses controlled

optimization issues and slow training. In contrast, S4Model is more efficient

simulate $\pi^-+\mathrm{C}$ and $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$ collisions at
p$_\mathrm{lab}=1.7$ GeV motivated by the recent HADES results. By comparing
the proton and $\Lambda$ transverse momentum spectra, it was observed that the
data and transport model calculation show a good agreement, if cluster
formation is included to obtain the free proton spectra. Predictions of light
cluster ($d$, $t$, $^3$He, $^4$He, as well as ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H and $\Xi$N)
multiplicities and spectra are made using a coalescence mechanism. The
resulting multiplicities suggest that the pion beam experiment can produce a
substantial amount of ${}^{3}_\Lambda$H, especially in $\pi^-+\mathrm{W}$
collisions due to the stopping of the $\Lambda$ inside the large tungsten
nucleus. The findings are supplemented by a statistical multi-fragmentation
analysis suggesting that even larger hyper-fragments are produced copiously. It
is suggested that even double strange hypernuclei are in reach and might be
studied in more detail using a slightly higher pion beam momentum.

  lymphocyte assessment in histopathological images",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformers, due to their ability to learn long range dependencies, have
overcome the shortcomings of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for global
perspective learning. Therefore, they have gained the focus of researchers for
several vision related tasks including medical diagnosis. However, their
multi-head attention module only captures global level feature representations,
which is insufficient for medical images. To address this issue, we propose a
Channel Boosted Hybrid Vision Transformer (CB HVT) that uses transfer learning
to generate boosted channels and employs both transformers and CNNs to analyse
lymphocytes in histopathological images. The proposed CB HVT comprises five
modules, including a channel generation module, channel exploitation module,
channel merging module, region-aware module, and a detection and segmentation
head, which work together to effectively identify lymphocytes. The channel
generation module uses the idea of channel boosting through transfer learning
to extract diverse channels from different auxiliary learners. In the CB HVT,
these boosted channels are first concatenated and ranked using an attention
mechanism in the channel exploitation module. A fusion block is then utilized
in the channel merging module for a gradual and systematic merging of the
diverse boosted channels to improve the network's learning representations. The
CB HVT also employs a proposal network in its region aware module and a head to
effectively identify objects, even in overlapping regions and with artifacts.
We evaluated the proposed CB HVT on two publicly available datasets for
lymphocyte assessment in histopathological images. The results show that CB HVT
outperformed other state of the art detection models, and has good
generalization ability, demonstrating its value as a tool for pathologists.

recently by improving the noise-robustness of audio-only automatic speech

existing AVSR approaches simply fuse the audio and visual features by
concatenation, without explicit interactions to capture the deep correlations
between them, which results in sub-optimal multimodal representations for
downstream speech recognition task. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal
global interaction and local alignment (GILA) approach for AVSR, which captures
the deep audio-visual (A-V) correlations from both global and local
perspectives. Specifically, we design a global interaction model to capture the
A-V complementary relationship on modality level, as well as a local alignment
approach to model the A-V temporal consistency on frame level. Such a holistic
view of cross-modal correlations enable better multimodal representations for
AVSR. Experiments on public benchmarks LRS3 and LRS2 show that our GILA
outperforms the supervised learning state-of-the-art.

techniques are applied to reduce the image size without loss of reasonable
image quality. Same become more prominent in the case of videos which contains
image sequences and higher compression ratios are achieved in low throughput
networks. Assessment of quality of images in such scenarios has become of
particular interest. Subjective evaluation in most of the scenarios is
infeasible so objective evaluation is preferred. Among the three objective
quality measures, full-reference and reduced-reference methods require an
original image in some form to calculate the image quality which is unfeasible
in scenarios such as broadcasting, acquisition or enhancement. Therefore, a
no-reference Perceptual Image Quality Index (PIQI) is proposed in this paper to
assess the quality of digital images which calculates luminance and gradient
statistics along with mean subtracted contrast normalized products in multiple
scales and color spaces. These extracted features are provided to a stacked
ensemble of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to perform the perceptual quality
evaluation. The performance of the PIQI is checked on six benchmark databases
and compared with twelve state-of-the-art methods and competitive results are
achieved. The comparison is made based on RMSE, Pearson and Spearman
correlation coefficients between ground truth and predicted quality scores. The
scores of 0.0552, 0.9802 and 0.9776 are achieved respectively for these metrics

DR3, APASS DR9, ATLAS Refcat2, and Gaia DR3 synthetic photometry to obtain
multiple zero-point calibrations of the TRGB magnitude, $M_{I}^{TRGB}$. Our
sample contains Milky Way halo stars at high galactic latitudes ($|b| > 36$)
where the impact of metallicity, dust, and crowding are minimised. The
magnitude of the TRGB is identified using Sobel edge detection, but this
approach introduced a systematic offset. To address this issue, we utilised
simulations with PARSEC isochrones and showed how to calibrate and remove this
bias. Applying our method within the colour range where the slope of the TRGB
is relatively flat for metal-poor halo stars (1.55 $<$ $(BP-RP)$ $<$ 2.25), we
find a weighted average $M_{I}^{TRGB} = -4.042 \pm 0.041$ (stat) $\pm0.031$

being independent of other distance indicators and will help probe systematics

turbo-autoencoder architectures enables faster, more consistent training and
better generalization to arbitrary decoding iterations than training based on
deep unfolding. We propose fitting the components via extrinsic information
transfer (EXIT) charts to a desired behavior which enables scaling to larger
message lengths ($k \approx 1000$) while retaining competitive performance. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first autoencoder that performs close to
classical codes in this regime. Although the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss
function optimizes the bit error rate (BER) of the components, the design via
EXIT charts enables to focus on the block error rate (BLER). In serially
concatenated systems the component-wise TGP approach is well known for inner
components with a fixed outer binary interface, e.g., a learned inner code or
equalizer, with an outer binary error correcting code. In this paper we extend
the component training to structures with an inner and outer autoencoder, where
we propose a new 1-bit quantization strategy for the encoder outputs based on
the underlying communication problem. Finally, we discuss the model complexity
of the learned components during design time (training) and inference and show
that the number of weights in the encoder can be reduced by 99.96 %.

multi-lingual summarization (MLS) and cross-lingual summarization (CLS).
However, these two tasks have been studied separately due to the different

the first step towards M2MS, we conduct preliminary studies to show that M2MS
can better transfer task knowledge across different languages than MLS and CLS.
Furthermore, we propose Pisces, a pre-trained M2MS model that learns language

based on density functional theory. Unlike the traditional homobilayers of
TMDs, these heterobilayers result in broken inversion symmetry and alter their

spectra of these heterobilayers, we have observed that the shear and layer
breathing modes (LBM) at lower frequencies ($<$ 50 cm$^{-1}$), arise due to the
interlayer interactions between the different monolayers. We have simulated the
electronic properties using the G$_0$W$_0$ method and perceived the nature of
the band gap which mainly depends on the chalcogen atoms. Our results clearly
indicate that the band gap is of direct nature for hetero bilayers with
different chalcogen atoms and indirect nature for the same chalcogen based
heterobilayers, with a band gap range between 1.4 to 1.7 eV. The exciton states
of these materials are calculated with the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) and
found that the binding energies of inter-layer exciton are of the order of

limitations are mainly imposed due to the lack of terahertz focal-plane arrays
(THz-FPAs) that can directly provide the frequency-resolved and/or

first THz-FPA that can directly provide the spatial amplitude and phase

photoconductive nanoantennas optimized to rapidly detect broadband terahertz

studies have proposed a glass-based metasurface that can enhance mmWave indoor
signals. The transparent reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) focuses on
the mmWave signal to a specific location indoors. In this paper, a novel
RIS-assisted mmWave indoor enhancement scheme is proposed, in which a
transparent RIS is deployed on the glass to enhance mmWave indoor signals, and
three assisted transmission scenarios, namely passive RIS (PRIS), active RIS
(ARIS), and a novel hybrid RIS (HRIS) are proposed. This paper aims to maximize
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the received signal for the three assisted
transmission scenarios. The closed-form solution to the maximum SNR is
presented in the PRIS and the ARIS-assisted transmission scenarios. Meanwhile,
the closed-form solution to the maximum SNR for the HRIS-assisted transmission
scenario is presented for given active unit cells. In addition, the performance
of the proposed scheme is analyzed under three assisted transmission scenarios.
The results indicate that under a specific RIS power budget, the ARIS-assisted
transmission scenario achieves the highest data rate and energy efficiency.
Also, it requires very few unit cells, thus dramatically reducing the size of
the metasurface.

The key
concepts of quantum mechanics are quantum fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations of
quantum fields confined in a finite-size system induce the zero-point energy
shift. This quantum phenomenon, the Casimir effect, is one of the most striking
phenomena of quantum mechanics in the sense that there are no classical analogs
and has been attracting much attention beyond the hierarchy of energy scales,
ranging from elementary particle physics to condensed matter physics, together
with photonics. However, the non-Hermitian extension of the Casimir effect and
the application to spintronics have not yet been investigated enough, although
exploring energy sources and developing energy-efficient nanodevices are its
central issues. Here we fill this gap. By developing a magnonic analog of the
Casimir effect into non-Hermitian systems, we show that this non-Hermitian
Casimir effect of magnons is enhanced as the Gilbert damping constant (i.e.,
the energy dissipation rate) increases. When the damping constant exceeds a
critical value, the non-Hermitian Casimir effect of magnons exhibits an
oscillating behavior, including a beating one, as a function of the film
thickness and is characterized by the exceptional point. Our result suggests
that energy dissipation serves as a key ingredient of Casimir engineering.

this ill-posed inverse problem, most band selection methods adopt hand-crafted

prominent bands. These methods are either very slow due to the computational
cost of repeatedly training with respect to different selection frequencies or
different band combinations. Many traditional methods rely on the scene prior
and thus are not applicable to other scenarios. In this paper, we present a
novel one-shot Neural Band Selection (NBS) framework for spectral recovery.
Unlike conventional searching approaches with a discrete search space and a
non-differentiable search strategy, our NBS is based on the continuous
relaxation of the band selection process, thus allowing efficient band search
using gradient descent. To enable the compatibility for se- lecting any number
of bands in one-shot, we further exploit the band-wise correlation matrices to
progressively suppress similar adjacent bands. Extensive evaluations on the

consistent performance gains over competitive baselines when examined with four

Pulse-induced binding or repulsion of electrons is shown to be efficient also
for weakly dispersive optical phonons and in the presence of weak Coulomb
repulsion.

UEs conditioned on the pixel and perceptual similarity between UEs and LEs.

Unreal Engine promises unprecedented industrial applications. The paradigms and

business: where interoperability and scalability are required. The study of the
following issue `` Which architecture should we implement to integrate
real-world data, in an Unreal Engine 5 simulator and in a mixed-reality

innovative and conceptual way, such as the generalization of mixedreality
technologies, Internet of Things, digital twins, Big Data but providing a
solution for simple and actual use cases. This paper gives a detailed analysis
of the issue, at both theoretical and operational level. Then, the document
goes deep into Unreal Engine's operation in order to extract the vanilla
capabilities. Next, the C++ Plugin system is reviewed in details as well as the
third-party library integration: pitfalls to be avoided are shown. Finally, the
last chapter proposes a generic architecture, useful in large-scale industrial
3D applications, such as collaborative work or hyper-connected simulators. This
document might be of interest to an Unreal Engine expert who would like to
discover about server architectures. Conversely, it could be relevant for an
expert in backend servers who wants to learn about Unreal Engine capabilities.
This research concludes that Unreal Engine's modularity enables integration
with almost any protocol. The features to integrate external real data are
numerous but depend on use cases. Distributed systems for Big Data require a
scalable architecture, possibly without the use of the Unreal Engine dedicated

of models or satisfying assignments of a given Boolean formula $F$. Model
counting is a fundamental problem in computer science with a wide range of
applications. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using
hashing-based techniques for approximate model counting that provide
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-guarantees: i.e., the count returned is within a
$(1+\varepsilon)$-factor of the exact count with confidence at least
$1-\delta$. While hashing-based techniques attain reasonable scalability for
large enough values of $\delta$, their scalability is severely impacted for
smaller values of $\delta$, thereby preventing their adoption in application
domains that require estimates with high confidence.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to address the Achilles heel of
hashing-based techniques: we propose a novel approach based on rounding that
allows us to achieve a significant reduction in runtime for smaller values of
$\delta$. The resulting counter, called RoundMC, achieves a substantial runtime
performance improvement over the current state-of-the-art counter, ApproxMC. In
particular, our extensive evaluation over a benchmark suite consisting of 1890
instances shows that RoundMC solves 204 more instances than ApproxMC, and
achieves a $4\times$ speedup over ApproxMC.

weak charge mediated by $Z'$ only depends on the mass of light gauge boson.
Since two Goldstone bosons are required to serve as the longitudinal components

  walk interpretation","23 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Enskog kinetic theory is applied to compute the mean square displacement
of intruders immersed in a granular gas of smooth inelastic hard spheres
(grains). Both species (intruders and grains) are surrounded by an interstitial
molecular gas (background) that plays the role of a thermal bath. The influence
of the latter on the motion of intruders and grains is modeled via a standard
viscous drag force supplemented by a stochastic Langevin-like force
proportional to the background temperature. We solve the corresponding
Enskog--Lorentz kinetic equation by means of the Chapman--Enskog expansion
truncated to first order in the gradient of the intruder number density. The
integral equation for the diffusion coefficient is solved by considering the
first two Sonine approximations. To test these results, we also compute the
diffusion coefficient from the numerical solution of the inelastic Enskog
equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. We find that the
first Sonine approximation generally agrees well with the simulation results,
although significant discrepancies arise when the intruders become lighter than
the grains. Such discrepancies are largely mitigated by the use of the
second-Sonine approximation, in excellent agreement with computer simulations
even for moderately strong inelasticities and/or dissimilar mass and diameter
ratios. We invoke a random walk picture of the intruders' motion to shed light
on the physics underlying the intricate dependence of the diffusion coefficient
on the main system parameters. This approach, recently employed to study the
case of an intruder immersed in a granular gas, also proves useful in the
present case of a granular suspension. Finally, we discuss the applicability of
our model to real systems in the self-diffusion case. We conclude that
collisional effects may strongly impact the diffusion coefficient of the
grains.

reconciles the seemingly conflicting reports on the measured tunneling times.
This is done by defining the barrier traversal time as the difference of the
expectation values of the corresponding TOA-operators in the presence and
absence of the barrier. We show that for an arbitrarily shaped potential
barrier, there exists three traversal time regimes corresponding to
full-tunneling, partial-tunneling, and \non-tunneling processes, which are
determined by the relation between the the support of the incident wavepacket's
momentum distribution $\tilde{\psi}(k)$, and shape of the barrier. The
full-tunneling process occurs when the support of $\tilde{\psi}(k)$ is below
the minimum height of the barrier, resulting to an instantaneous tunneling
time. The partial-tunneling process occurs when the support or a segment of the
support of $\tilde{\psi}(k)$ lies between the minimum and maximum height of the
barrier. For this case, the particle does not ""fully"" tunnel through the entire
barrier system resulting to a non-zero traversal time. The non-tunneling regime
occurs when the support of $\tilde{\psi}(k)$ is above the maximum height of the
barrier system, leading to a classical above-barrier traversal time. We argue
that the zero and non-zero tunneling times measured in different attoclock
experiments correspond to the full-tunneling and partial-tunneling processes,
respectively.

and integrity of IoT systems, in presence of failure of individual components,
random data corruption or malicious attacks. Fault-tolerant systems in general
are essential in assuring continuity of service for mission critical
applications. However, their implementation may be challenging and expensive.
In this study, IoT Systems with Byzantine Fault-Tolerance are considered.
Analytical models and solutions are presented as well as a detailed analysis
for the evaluation of the availability. Byzantine Fault Tolerance is
particularly important for blockchain mechanisms, and in turn for IoT, since it
can provide a secure, reliable and decentralized infrastructure for IoT devices
to communicate and transact with each other. The proposed model is based on
continuous-time Markov chains, and it analyses the availability of Byzantine
Fault-Tolerant systems. While the availability model is based on a
continuous-time Markov chain where the breakdown and repair times follow
exponential distributions, the number of the Byzantine nodes in the network
studied follows various distributions. The numerical results presented report
availability as a function of the number of participants and the relative
number of honest actors in the system. It can be concluded from the model that
there is a non-linear relationship between the number of servers and network
availability; i.e. the availability is inversely proportional to the number of
nodes in the system. This relationship is further strengthened as the ratio of
break-down rate over repair rate increases.

first contribution is the proof that this kernel is characteristic (i.e
injectivity of the embedding in the associated Reproducing Kernel Hilbert

a decomposition of the input contributions. Using these indices, we can
identify which inputs should be neglected (screening) and we can rank the
others by influence (ranking). The estimation of these indices is also adapted
to the set-valued outputs. Finally we test the proposed method on two test

building blocks, which can be robotically assembled for efficient and scalable
production. The traditional, design-limiting periodicity in material design is
overcome by utilizing Wang tiles to achieve compatibility among building
blocks. We illustrate our approach with the design and manufacturing of an
L-shaped domain inspired by a scissor-like soft gripper, whose internal module
distribution was optimized to achieve an extreme tilt of a tip of the gripper's
jaw when the handle part was uniformly compressed. The geometry of individual
modules was built on a 3$\times$3 grid of elliptical holes with varying
semi-axes ratios and alternating orientations. We optimized the distribution of
the modules within the L-shaped domain using an enumeration approach combined
with a factorial search strategy. To address the challenge of seamless
interface connections in modular manufacturing, we produced the final designs
by casting silicone rubber into modular molds automatically assembled by a
robotic arm. The predicted performance was validated experimentally using a
custom-built, open-hardware test rig, Thymos, supplemented with digital image
correlation measurements. Our study demonstrates the potential for enhancing
the mechanical performance of architectured materials by incorporating
nonuniform modular designs and efficient robot-assisted manufacturing.

statu nascendi appearing both as a hot topic and a major challenge. The reason
for this is the fact that they are inherently non-equilibrium. This feature
opens a landscape of phenomena yet to be explored that are absent in the
presence of thermal fluctuations alone. Recently a paradoxical effect has been
briefly communicated in which a free particle transport induced by active
fluctuations in the form white Poisson shot noise can be enormously boosted
when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. In this
work we considerably extend the original predictions and investigate the impact
of statistics of active noise on the occurrence of this effect. We construct a
toy-model of the jump-relaxation process that allow us to identify different
regimes of the free particle transport boost and explain their corresponding
mechanisms. Moreover, we formulate and interpret the conditions for statistics
of active fluctuations that are necessary for the emergence of giant
enhancement of the free particle transport induced by the periodic potential.
Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for
biological ones such as e.g. living cells where fluctuations generated by
metabolic activities are active by default.

has witnessed great progress. FAS is usually considered a classification
problem, where each class is assumed to contain a single cluster optimized by

clusters, and a single-center is insufficient to capture the inherent structure
of the FAS data. However, few approaches consider large distribution
discrepancies in the field of FAS. In this work, we propose a unified framework
called Latent Distribution Adjusting (LDA) with properties of latent,
discriminative, adaptive, generic to improve the robustness of the FAS model by
adjusting complex data distribution with multiple prototypes. 1) Latent. LDA
attempts to model the data of each class as a Gaussian mixture distribution,
and acquire a flexible number of centers for each class in the last fully
connected layer implicitly. 2) Discriminative. To enhance the intra-class
compactness and inter-class discrepancy, we propose a margin-based loss for
providing distribution constrains for prototype learning. 3) Adaptive. To make
LDA more efficient and decrease redundant parameters, we propose Adaptive
Prototype Selection (APS) by selecting the appropriate number of centers
adaptively according to different distributions. 4) Generic. Furthermore, LDA
can adapt to unseen distribution by utilizing very few training data without
re-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can 1) make
the final representation space both intra-class compact and inter-class
separable, 2) outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multiple standard FAS

dilute the embedding of strong positive words by weighted mixing with
unknown-word embedding, making the augmented inputs hard to be recognized as

weights through a constrained min-max optimization process with the guidance of
the labels. Empirical studies on three benchmark datasets show that AWD can
generate more effective data augmentations and outperform the state-of-the-art

data augmentations generated by AWD are interpretable and can flexibly extend
to new examples without further training.

comparatively assess the feasibility of several state-of-the-art CSI-free
multi-antenna WET schemes for WPUSNs, under a given power budget. Moreover, to
overcome the extremely low WET efficiency in underground channels, we propose a

information from multiple modalities for various downstream tasks. However,
traditional aggregation-based multimodal fusion methods ignore the
inter-modality relationship, treat each modality equally, suffer sensor noise,
and thus reduce multimodal learning performance. In this work, we propose a
novel multimodal contrastive method to explore more reliable multimodal
representations under the weak supervision of unimodal predicting.
Specifically, we first capture task-related unimodal representations and the
unimodal predictions from the introduced unimodal predicting task. Then the
unimodal representations are aligned with the more effective one by the
designed multimodal contrastive method under the supervision of the unimodal
predictions. Experimental results with fused features on two image-text
classification benchmarks UPMC-Food-101 and N24News show that our proposed
Unimodality-Supervised MultiModal Contrastive UniS-MMC learning method
outperforms current state-of-the-art multimodal methods. The detailed ablation

the continuous development of surface-specific spectroscopies, such as
vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG). Similarly to what happens in other
spectroscopies, to extract all of the information encoded in the VSFG spectra
we must turn to atomistic simulations. The latter are conventionally based
either on empirical force field models, which cannot describe bond breaking and
formation or systems with a complex electronic structure, or on \textit{ab

computational cost. These limitations ultimately hamper our understanding of
aqueous interfaces. In this work, we overcome these constraints by combining
two machine learning techniques, namely high-dimensional neural network
interatomic potentials and symmetry-adapted Gaussian process regression, to
simulate the SFG spectra of the water/air interface with \textit{ab initio}
accuracy. Leveraging a data-driven local decomposition of atomic environments,
we develop a simple scheme that allows us to obtain VSFG spectra in agreement
with current experiments. Moreover, we identify the main sources of inaccuracy

recently motivated both academia and industry to research how fairness can be
ensured in recommender systems. For recommender systems, such issues are well
exemplified by occupation recommendation, where biases in historical data may
lead to recommender systems relating one gender to lower wages or to the

focuses on mitigating discrimination experienced by users of recommender
systems, has seen a vast number of diverse approaches for addressing different
types of discrimination. The nature of said discrimination depends on the
setting and the applied fairness interpretation, of which there are many
variations. This survey serves as a systematic overview and discussion of the
current research on consumer-side fairness in recommender systems. To that end,
a novel taxonomy based on high-level fairness interpretation is proposed and

single receiver while using ambient carriers. Such a design eliminates system
reliance on redundant transceivers with high power consumption. Results
demonstrate that EEWScatter achieves the lowest overall system power

main task is to vary the zero temperature superconducting energy gap from its
zero value in the normal state, to the highest value of 60 meV. We find that
there are two different reduced phase space regimes for the first harmonic line
node's order parameter. The first scenario considers that when the Fermi energy
and the nearest hopping terms have the same order of magnitude, the physics can
be described by a picture given by nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. A
second scenario indicates, that when the Fermi energy parameter and the hopping
term have different order of magnitude; the physical picture tends to be
related to the nonrelativistic quantum mechanical degrees of freedom coming
from quasi-stationary quantum energy levels, with a damping term seen in the
probability density distribution function, that is described in the
configuration space. Henceforth, it is concluded that the use of the zero
temperature elastic scattering cross-section links the phase and configuration
spaces through the inverse scattering lifetime, and helps to clarify the role
of the degrees of freedom in Strontium-doped Lanthanum Cuprate. Finally, we
think that the self-consistent numerical procedure with the reduced phase

three concentric inner shells and an acute rhombohedron filling the gaps in

of chemically mixed sites in the structure, which amount to only 7.40 % of the
all the atomic sites within an RTH cluster. In particular, a disorder-free
environment was noticed within a nearest neighbor of an isolated Tb3+ ion,
which is presumably one of the main contributors in enhancing antiferromagnetic
order in the present compound. The second significant finding was the
observance of an orientationally ordered trigonal pyramid-like unit with a
height of 4.2441(7) angstrom at the center of the RTH cluster, which has never
been observed in Tsai-type compounds before. Such unit is noticed to bring

claims a nearly Gaussian behavior of the posterior. \cite{SpLaplace2022}
established some rather accurate finite sample results about the quality of
Laplace approximation in terms of the so called effective dimension $p$ under
the critical dimension constraint $p^{3} \ll n$. However, this condition can be
too restrictive for many applications like error-in-operator problem or Deep
Neuronal Networks. This paper addresses the question whether the dimensionality
condition can be relaxed and the accuracy of approximation can be improved if
the target of estimation is low dimensional while the nuisance parameter is
high or infinite dimensional. Under mild conditions, the marginal posterior can
be approximated by a Gaussian mixture and the accuracy of the approximation
only depends on the target dimension. Under the condition $p^{2} \ll n$ or in
some special situation like semi-orthogonality, the Gaussian mixture can be
replaced by one Gaussian distribution leading to a classical Laplace result.
The second result greatly benefits from the recent advances in Gaussian

If more than one time scale is relevant for the event under study, models are
required that can incorporate the dependence of a hazard along two (or more)
time scales. Such models should be flexible to capture the joint influence of
several times scales and nonparametric smoothing techniques are obvious
candidates. P-splines offer a flexible way to specify such hazard surfaces, and
estimation is achieved by maximizing a penalized Poisson likelihood. Standard
observations schemes, such as right-censoring and left-truncation, can be

transition which contributes to thermoelectric power is attracting more and
more attention. Here, we demonstrate the PTE response can be reshaped when
Ca3Ru2O7 undergoes meta-magnetic phase (MMP) transition driven by both
temperature and magnetic field. Firstly, a sign change is observed crossing TS
= 48 K and the linear polarization angle dependent PTE current maximizes along
a-axis above TS while maximizes along b-axis below TS, which indicates that the
antiferromagnetic spin order contributes to such spatial anisotropy. Secondly,
in the temperature range of around 40 ~ 50 K, the PTE current is found to be
sharply suppressed when external magnetic field is applied in plane along
a-axis but is only gradually suppressed when applied field is along b-axis
which gives out two critical fields. We attribute such suppression of PTE
current under magnetic field to the suppression of the spin entropy in the
phase transition between the antiferromagnetic state and the MMP state and the
H-T phase diagrams of Ca3Ru2O7 is redrawn accordingly. Compared to previously

processing, and due to the lack of reference images in most practical
scenarios, no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA), has gained
increasing attention recently. With the development of deep learning
technology, many deep neural network-based NR-IQA methods have been developed,
which try to learn the image quality based on the understanding of database
information. Currently, Transformer has achieved remarkable progress in various
vision tasks. Since the characteristics of the attention mechanism in
Transformer fit the global perceptual impact of artifacts perceived by a human,
Transformer is thus well suited for image quality assessment tasks. In this
paper, we propose a Transformer based NR-IQA model using a predicted objective
error map and perceptual quality token. Specifically, we firstly generate the
predicted error map by pre-training one model consisting of a Transformer
encoder and decoder, in which the objective difference between the distorted
and the reference images is used as supervision. Then, we freeze the parameters
of the pre-trained model and design another branch using the vision Transformer
to extract the perceptual quality token for feature fusion with the predicted
error map. Finally, the fused features are regressed to the final image quality
score. Extensive experiments have shown that our proposed method outperforms
the current state-of-the-art in both authentic and synthetic image databases.
Moreover, the attentional map extracted by the perceptual quality token also
does conform to the characteristics of the human visual system.

estimation in motion-constrained inertial navigation systems is presented. The
framework uses a jump Markov model to describe the navigation system's motion
mode and navigation state dynamics with a single model. A bank of Kalman
filters is then used for joint inference of the navigation state and the motion
mode. A method for learning unknown parameters in the jump Markov model, such
as the motion mode transition probabilities, is also presented. The application
of the proposed framework is illustrated via two examples. The first example is
a foot-mounted navigation system that adapts its behavior to different gait
speeds. The second example is a foot-mounted navigation system that detects
when the user walks on flat ground and locks the vertical position estimate
accordingly. Both examples show that the proposed framework provides
significantly better position accuracy than a standard zero-velocity aided
inertial navigation system. More importantly, the examples show that the
proposed framework provides a theoretically well-grounded approach for
developing new motion-constrained inertial navigation systems that can learn
different motion patterns.

IC 4329A at a redshift of $z$ = 0.016. This is based on observations carried
out by the {\it Imaging X-ray Polarimeter (IXPE)}. {\it IXPE} observed IC 4329A
on January 5, 2023, for a total observing time of 458 ks. From the
model-independent analysis, we found a polarization degree ($\Pi_{X}$) of
3.7$\pm$1.5$\%$ and a polarization position angle ($\Psi_{X}$) of
61$^{\circ}$$\pm$12$^{\circ}$ in the 2$-$8 keV energy range (at 1$\sigma$
confidence level). This is also in agreement with the values of $\Pi_{X}$ and
$\Psi_{X}$ of 4.7$\pm$2.2$\%$ and 71$^{\circ}$ $\pm$14$^{\circ}$ respectively
obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis of the I, Q and U Stokes spectra in
the 2$-$8 keV energy band (at the 90$\%$ confidence). The value of $\Pi_X$ in
the 2-8 keV band obtained from the model-independent analysis is lower than the
minimum detectable polarization (MDP) value of 4.5$\%$. However, $\Pi_X$
obtained from spectro-polarimetric analysis in the 2-8 keV band is larger than
the MDP value. In the 3-5 keV band, we found $\Pi_X$ of 6.5 $\pm$ 1.8, which is
larger than the MDP value of 5.5$\%$. The observed moderate value of $\Pi_{X}$
obtained from the analysis of the {\it IXPE} data in the 3$-$5 keV band argues
against a spherical lamp$-$post geometry for the X-ray corona in IC 4329A;
however, considering simulations, the observed polarization measurements tend
to favour a conical shape geometry for the corona. This is the first time
measurement of X-ray polarization in IC 4329A. Measurements of the X-ray

existing learning-based assessment approaches, such as the requirement of
manual annotation for motion influence and the lack of explicit mechanisms for
realizing motion-induced abnormalities under contextual variations in CVS over
time. By utilizing long-short term memory and variational auto-encoder
structures, an encoder--decoder model is trained not only to self-reproduce an
input sequence of the CVS but also to extrapolate the future in a parallel
fashion. By doing so, the model can capture contextual knowledge lying in a
temporal CVS sequence while being regularized to explore a general relationship
over the entire time-series. A motion-influenced CVS of low-quality is
detected, based on the residual between the input sequence and its neural
representation with a cut--off value determined from the two-sigma rule of
thumb over the training set. Our experimental observations validated two
claims: (i) in the learning environment of label-absence, assessment
performance is achievable at a competitive level to the supervised setting, and
(ii) the contextual information across a time series of CVS is advantageous for
effectively realizing motion-induced unrealistic distortions in signal
amplitude and morphology. We also investigated the capability as a
pseudo-labeling tool to minimize human-craft annotation by preemptively
providing strong candidates for motion-induced anomalies. Empirical evidence
has shown that machine-guided annotation can reduce inevitable human-errors

ignored. Arguably due to this lack of study, the dynamics of NC are today
little understood, especially in real-world settings. In this work, we study NC
in simulation environments that consist of multiple, diverse niches and
populations that evolve their plasticity, evolvability and niche-constructing

populations experiencing mass extinctions, arms races and oscillations. To
understand these behaviors, we analyze the interaction between NC and

complexifying the simulation environments studying NC, by considering multiple

the contribution of the inelastic atomic processes, and found that three-body

in comparison with those latest experiments of the IPD for Al plasmas with
wide-range conditions of 70-700 eV temperature and 0.2-3 times of solid

provide a promising tool to study the ionization balance and the atomic

problem can be tackled by using localized SVMs instead, which also offer the
additional advantage of being able to apply different hyperparameters to
different regions of the input space. In this paper, localized SVMs are
analyzed with regards to their consistency. It is proven that they inherit
$L_p$- as well as risk consistency from global SVMs under very weak conditions
and even if the regions underlying the localized SVMs are allowed to change as
the size of the training data set increases.

studied in the literature where different approaches have been developed, also

only few works deal with dynamic capital allocations and its relation with
BSDEs. Moreover, all those works only examine the case of an underneath risk
measure satisfying cash-additivity and, moreover, a large part of them focuses
on the specific case of the gradient allocation where Gateaux differentiability
is assumed. The main goal of this paper is, instead, to study general dynamic
capital allocations associated to cash-subadditive risk measures, generalizing
the approaches already existing in the literature and motivated by the presence
of (ambiguity on) interest rates. Starting from an axiomatic approach, we then
focus on the case where the underlying risk measures are induced by BSDEs whose
drivers depend also on the y-variable. In this setting, we surprisingly find
that the corresponding capital allocation rules solve special kinds of Backward

central role in modern astrophysics, Binary evolution leads to the formation of

the formation of exotic radio millisecond pulsars. In some cases, the binary

detected by LIGO since 2015. The coming decade is expected to reveal a large
number of discoveries of binary compact systems, as well as their progenitors

important to have a modern textbook on the physics of binary stars evolution,
from ordinary stars to X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. The scope
of this book is that the reader (student or educated expert) will learn the

synthesis of heavy nuclei in pycnonuclear reactions in compact stars are
studied on a quantum mechanical basis. (2) Methods: Method of multiple internal
reflections is generalized for pycnoreactions in compact stars with new
calculations of quasibound spectra and spectra of zero-point vibrations. (3)
Results: Peculiarities of the method are analyzed for reaction with isotopes of
Carbon. The developed method takes into account continuity and conservation of
quantum flux (describing pycnonuclear reaction) inside the full spacial region
of reaction including nuclear region. This gives appearance of new states
(called as quasibound states), in which compound nuclear systems of Magnesium
are formed with the largest probability. These states have not been studied yet
in synthesis of elements in stars. Energy spectra of zero-point vibrations and
spectra of quasibound states are estimated with high precision for reactions
with isotopes of Carbon. At the first time influence of plasma screening on
quasibound states and states of zero-point vibrations in pycnonuclear reactions
has been studied. (4) Conclusion: The probability of formation of compound
nuclear system in quasibound states in pycnonuclear reaction is essentially
larger than the probability of formation of this system in states of zero-point
vibrations studied by Zel'dovich and followers. So, synthesis of Magnesium from
isotopes of Carbon is more probable through the quasibound states than through
the states of zero-point vibrations in compact stars. Energy spectra of
zero-point vibrations are changed essentially after taking plasma screening
into account. Analysis shows that from all studied isotopes of Magnesium only
\isotope[24]{Mg} is stable after synthesis at energy of relative motion of
4.881~MeV of incident nuclei \isotope[12]{C}.

heat and sustain the inductively coupled plasma (ICP). Owing to their near
cylindrical symmetry, the coupling between the radio-frequency (RF) active
currents and the source plasma is studied using a 2D electromagnetic approach
with simplified expressions for the plasma electrical conductivity taken from
the literature. The power absorbed by the plasma and the effect of the induced
plasma currents in lowering the inductance of the driver are based on data from
the dedicated S16 experimental campaign (y.~2020) of SPIDER: plasma electron
densities on the order of $10^{18}$ m$^{-3}$, electron temperatures $\sim 10$
eV; neutral gas pressure $\sim 0.3$ Pa and up to $50$ kW of net power per
driver. It is found that the plasma conductivity cannot be explained by the
friction forces associated to local collisional processes alone. The inclusion
of an effective collisionality associated to non-local processes seems also
insufficient to explain the experimental information. Only when the electrical
conductivity is reduced where the RF magnetic field is more intense, can the
heating power and driver inductance be acceptably reproduced. We present the
first 2D electromagnetic ICP calculations in SPIDER for two types of plasma,
without and with the addition of a static magnetic field. The power transfer
efficiency to the plasma of the first drivers of SPIDER, in view of these

single-granular (tokens or sentences) explanation, which inevitably leads to
explanation redundancy and inconsistency. To address such issues, this paper
explores the viability of multi-granular rationale extraction with consistency

given a pretrained veracity prediction model, both the token-level explainer

multi-granular rationales via differentiable masking. Meanwhile, three
diagnostic properties (fidelity, consistency, salience) are introduced and
applied to the training process, to ensure that the extracted rationales
satisfy faithfulness and consistency. Experimental results on three multi-hop

rooted graphs which are disposed in a somewhat mirror-symmetric fashion, there
are distinct eigenvalues supported in the end vertices of the path which are
too close to each other: their difference is smaller than the square root of
two in the even distance case, and smaller than one in the odd distance case.
As a first application, we show that these end vertices cannot be involved in a
quantum walk phenomenon known as perfect state transfer, significantly
strengthening a recent result by two of the authors along with Godsil and van
Bommel. For a second application, we show that there is no balanced integral
tree of odd diameter bigger than three, answering a question raised by H\'{i}c
and Nedela in 1998. Our main technique involves manipulating ratios of
characteristic polynomials of graphs and subgraphs into continued fractions,
and exploring in detail their analytic properties. We will also make use of a
result due to P\'{o}lya and Szeg\""{o} about functions that preserve the
Lebesgue measure, which as far as we know is a novel application to
combinatorics. In the end, we connect our machinery to a recently introduced
algorithm to locate eigenvalues of trees, and with our approach we show that
any graph which contains two vertices separated by a unique path that is the
subdivision of a bridge with at least six inner vertices cannot be integral. As
a minor corollary this implies that most trees are not integral, but we believe
no one thought otherwise.

  Manufacturing Defect Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Visual quality inspection in high performance manufacturing can benefit from
automation, due to cost savings and improved rigor. Deep learning techniques
are the current state of the art for generic computer vision tasks like
classification and object detection. Manufacturing data can pose a challenge
for deep learning because data is highly repetitive and there are few images of
defects or deviations to learn from. Deep learning models trained with such
data can be fragile and sensitive to context, and can under-detect new defects
not found in the training data. In this work, we explore training defect
detection models to learn specific defects out of context, so that they are
more likely to be detected in new situations. We demonstrate how models trained
on diverse images containing a common defect type can pick defects out in new
circumstances. Such generic models could be more robust to new defects not
found data collected for training, and can reduce data collection impediments
to implementing visual inspection on production lines. Additionally, we
demonstrate that object detection models trained to predict a label and
bounding box outperform classifiers that predict a label only on held out test
data typical of manufacturing inspection tasks. Finally, we studied the factors
that affect generalization in order to train models that work under a wider
range of conditions.

photometric analysis reveals that SN 2016ije is subluminous ($M_{B,\rm{max}}$ =
$-$17.65$\pm$0.06 mag) but exhibits relatively broad light curves
(${\Delta}m_{15}(B)$ = 1.35$\pm$0.14 mag), similar to the behavior of SN
2002es. Our analysis of the bolometric light curve indicates that only
0.14$\pm$0.04 $M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion of SN
2016ije, which suggests a less energetic thermonuclear explosion when compared
to normal SNe Ia, and this left a considerable amount of unburned materials in
the ejecta. Spectroscopically, SN 2016ije resembles other SN 2002es-like SNe
Ia, except that the ejecta velocity inferred from its carbon absorption line
($\sim$ 4500 km s$^{-1}$) is much lower than that from silicon lines ($\sim$
8300 km s$^{-1}$) at around the maximum light. Additionally, most of the
absorption lines are broader than other 02es-like SNe Ia. These peculiarities
suggest the presence of significant unburned carbon in the inner region and a
wide line-forming region along the line of sight. These characteristics suggest
that SN 2016ije might originate from the violent merger of a white dwarf binary
system, when viewed near an orientation along the iron-group-element cavity
caused by the companion star.

propose two types of symmetry-breaking constraints: one indexing a node 0 and
one indexing the remaining nodes by lexicographically ordering their neighbor

solutions, we construct a graph indexing algorithm and prove that the resulting
graph indexing satisfies the proposed symmetry-breaking constraints. For the
classical GNN architectures considered in this paper, optimizing over a GNN

Thus, we study the case where the input graph is not fixed, implying that each
edge is a decision variable, and develop two mixed-integer optimization
formulations. To test our symmetry-breaking strategies and optimization
formulations, we consider an application in molecular design.

photons in coincidence with the radio event. We do not detect significant
emission, reporting the most stringent constraints, on short time scales, for
the FRB-like emission from SGR 1935+2154 with $E<10^{41}$ erg, corresponding to
a factor $<10^7$ with respect to the emitted radio energy. For the stacked
signal of steady emission from all repeaters, the obtained upper limit (UL) on
the FRBs luminosity ($L<1.6\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is more than two orders
of magnitudes lower than those derived from the individual sources. Finally, no
individual or triplet photons have been significantly associated with FRB
events. We derived the LAT ms energy sensitivity to be $E<10^{47}$ (D$_L$/150
Mpc)$^2$ erg, ruling out a gamma-ray-to-radio energy ratio greater than $10^9$
on ms timescales. The results reported here represent the most stringent UL
reported so far on the high-energy emission from FRBs on short and long time
scales, as well as on cumulative emission and individual photon searches. While
the origin of FRBs is still unclear, our work provides important constraints
for FRB modeling, which might shed light on their emission mechanism.

proliferation of false information through various mediums such as social media
and traditional news sources. The rapid spread of misinformation has made it
increasingly difficult for people to separate truth from fiction, and this has
the potential to cause significant harm to individuals and society as a whole.
In addition, there currently exists an information gap with regard to internet
education, with many schools across America not having the teaching personnel
nor resources to adequately educate their students about the dangers of the
internet, specifically with regard to misinformation in the political sphere.
To address the dangers of misinformation, some game developers have created
video games that aim to educate players on the issue and help them develop
critical thinking skills. These games can be used to raise awareness about the
importance of verifying information before sharing it. By doing so, they can
help reduce the spread of misinformation and promote a more informed and
discerning public. They can also provide players with a safe and controlled
environment to practice these skills and build confidence in their ability to
evaluate information. However, these existing games often suffer from various
shortcomings such as failing to adequately address how misinformation
specifically exploits the biases within people to be effective and rarely
covering how evolving modern technologies like sophisticated chatbots and deep
fakes have made individuals even more vulnerable to misinformation. The purpose
of this study is to create an educational misinformation game to address this
information gap and investigate its efficacy as an educational tool while also
iterating on the designs for previous games in the space.

evaluate GPTDroid on 86 apps from Google Play, and its activity coverage is
71%, with 32% higher than the best baseline, and can detect 36% more bugs with

demonstrator of this technology, operated in the Laboratorio Subterr\'aneo de
Canfranc. Achieving an energy resolution of 1% FWHM at 2.6 MeV and further
background rejection by means of the topology of the reconstructed tracks,
NEXT-White has been exploited beyond its original goals in order to perform a
neutrinoless double beta decay search. The analysis considers the combination
of 271.6 days of $^{136}$Xe-enriched data and 208.9 days of $^{136}$Xe-depleted
data. A detailed background modeling and measurement has been developed,
ensuring the time stability of the radiogenic and cosmogenic contributions
across both data samples. Limits to the neutrinoless mode are obtained in two
alternative analyses: a background-model-dependent approach and a novel direct
background-subtraction technique, offering results with small dependence on the
background model assumptions. With a fiducial mass of only 3.50$\pm$0.01 kg of
$^{136}$Xe-enriched xenon, 90% C.L. lower limits to the neutrinoless double
beta decay are found in the T$_{1/2}^{0\nu}>5.5\times10^{23}-1.3\times10^{24}$
yr range, depending on the method. The presented techniques stand as a
proof-of-concept for the searches to be implemented with larger NEXT detectors.

distributed memory systems is a challenging task in high-performance computing.
While many attempts were made to translate serial code into parallel code for a
shared memory environment (usually using OpenMP), none has managed to do so for
a distributed memory environment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach,
called MPI-rical, for automated MPI code generation using a transformer-based
model trained on approximately 25,000 serial code snippets and their
corresponding parallelized MPI code out of more than 50,000 code snippets in
our corpus (MPICodeCorpus). To evaluate the performance of the model, we first
break down the serial code to MPI-based parallel code translation problem into
two sub-problems and develop two research objectives: code completion defined
as given a location in the source code, predict the MPI function for that
location, and code translation defined as predicting an MPI function as well as
its location in the source code. We evaluate MPI-rical on MPICodeCorpus dataset
and on real-world scientific code benchmarks and compare its performance
between the code completion and translation tasks. Our experimental results
show that while MPI-rical performs better on the code completion task than the
code translation task, the latter is better suited for real-world programming
assistance, in which the tool suggests the need for an MPI function regardless
of prior knowledge. Overall, our approach represents a significant step forward
in automating the parallelization of serial code for distributed memory

We use scientific publications in a physics journal of a recent publication
year. These publications are connected by co-occurrence of terms, on the basis
of these connections we create a network and let this network grow by
successively adding publications. In this way we get a series of networks with
different sizes and this simulates a series of cities with different number of
inhabitants. This procedure is performed for different values of the term
occurrence threshold. We analyze how four important network parameters, namely
number of terms, number of clusters, number of links, and total link strength
increase with increasing size of the network. Particularly the number of
network links and the total network linkage strength are in our opinion the
parameters that dominate the scaling phenomenon and can be considered as a
simulation of the socio-economic strength of a city. We find a power law
dependence of these network parameters on network size and the power law
exponents for the lower occurrence thresholds are within the range that is
typical for urban scaling. In our approach the number of clusters can be
interpreted as a measure of diversity within the network. Since the occurrence
threshold determines the diversity of terms, we expect a special relation
between the occurrence threshold and the number of clusters. This is indeed the
case: whereas for the three other network parameters the scaling exponent
increases with increasing occurrence threshold, the number of clusters is the
only network parameter of which the scaling exponent decreases with increasing
occurrence threshold.

  https://github.com/FengheTan9/Multi-Level-Global-Context-Cross-Consistency",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical image segmentation is a critical step in computer-aided diagnosis,
and convolutional neural networks are popular segmentation networks nowadays.
However, the inherent local operation characteristics make it difficult to
focus on the global contextual information of lesions with different positions,
shapes, and sizes. Semi-supervised learning can be used to learn from both
labeled and unlabeled samples, alleviating the burden of manual labeling.
However, obtaining a large number of unlabeled images in medical scenarios
remains challenging. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-level Global
Context Cross-consistency (MGCC) framework that uses images generated by a
Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) as unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning.
The framework involves of two stages. In the first stage, a LDM is used to
generate synthetic medical images, which reduces the workload of data
annotation and addresses privacy concerns associated with collecting medical
data. In the second stage, varying levels of global context noise perturbation
are added to the input of the auxiliary decoder, and output consistency is
maintained between decoders to improve the representation ability. Experiments
conducted on open-source breast ultrasound and private thyroid ultrasound
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in bridging the
probability distribution and the semantic representation of the medical image.
Our approach enables the effective transfer of probability distribution
knowledge to the segmentation network, resulting in improved segmentation
accuracy. The code is available at

stabilized against collapse or decay by means of a quasi-one-dimensional

allows us to explore interactions and collisions of SSs moving in the same
channel and neighboring channels of the quasi-1D OL. For the case of equal atom
numbers in both components of the binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) we have
developed a variational approach that showed the stability of SS. For parameter
settings when the SS stays on the verge of collapse instability, we take into
account the Lee-Huang-Yang quantum fluctuations (QF) term in the coupled
Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Repulsive QF prevents the mean-field collapse and
gives rise to the formation of 2D QDs with peculiar properties such as
incompressibility and surface tension, which are inherent to liquids. The
proposed model of binary BEC loaded in a quasi-1D OL allows us to demonstrate
the manifestations of the incompressibility and surface tension of 2D QDs. The
formation of QD in imbalanced binary BEC with different numbers of atoms of the
components in the presence of a quasi-1D OL has been investigated. The possible
application of the proposed model to studies of anisotropic superfluidity is
discussed.

accommodate travel demand within the service region. Transit planners and
operators can access various data sources including household travel survey
data and mobile device location logs. However, when implementing a mobility
system with emerging technologies, estimating demand level becomes harder
because of more uncertainties with user behaviors. Therefore, this study
proposes an artificial intelligence-driven algorithm that combines sequential
transit network design with optimal learning. An operator gradually expands its
route system to avoid risks from inconsistency between designed routes and
actual travel demand. At the same time, observed information is archived to
update the knowledge that the operator currently uses. Three learning policies
are compared within the algorithm: multi-armed bandit, knowledge gradient, and
knowledge gradient with correlated beliefs. For validation, a new route system
is designed on an artificial network based on public use microdata areas in New
York City. Prior knowledge is reproduced from the regional household travel
survey data. The results suggest that exploration considering correlations can
achieve better performance compared to greedy choices in general. In future
work, the problem may incorporate more complexities such as demand elasticity
to travel time, no limitations to the number of transfers, and costs for
expansion.

stellar accretors but has never been characterized in detail on low-mass

investigate the emission line variability of two low-mass companions (M<30
MJup) to stars to understand their accretion mechanisms. Using J-band
observations, we analyze the short to long-term variability of the HI Paschen
{\beta} emission line (1.282 {\mu}m) for GQ Lup b and GSC 06214-00210 b.
Archival spectroscopic observations are also examined to extend the time span.
We compare their line profiles and intensities to more massive accretors and
magnetospheric accretion and shock models. Both objects have HI Paschen {\beta}
flux variability that is moderate at short timescales (< 50 %) and increases at
longer timescales (~1000 % on decade timescales), resembling classical T Tauri
stars. GQ Lup b's line profiles are compatible with magnetospheric accretion.
GSC 06214-00210 b's profiles are reproduced by both magnetospheric accretion
and shock models, except for the brightest epoch for which the shock model is
highly favored. Both companions have C/O values broadly consistent with solar
values. While magnetospheric accretion is favored for GQ Lup b, higher
resolution (R > 10000) observations are required to disentangle the two
(non-exclusive) line formation mechanisms. The similarity in variability
behavior may support similar accretion mechanisms between these low-mass
companions and classical T Tauri stars. The significant variability observed at
months and longer timescales could explain the low yield of H{\alpha} imaging
campaigns.

an evolving network. As opposed to existing models, in which the network
typically evolves by discretely adding or removing edges, we instead propose a
model for opinion formation which is coupled to a network evolving through a
system of ordinary differential equations for the edge weights. We interpret
each edge weight as the strength of the relationship between a pair of
individuals, with edges increasing in weight if pairs continually listen to
each others' opinions and decreasing if not. We investigate the impact of
various edge dynamics at different timescales on the opinion dynamic itself.
This is done partly through analytic results and partly through extensive
numerical simulations of two case studies: one using bounded confidence
interaction dynamics in the opinion formation process (as in the classical
Hegselmann-Krause model) and one using an exponentially decaying interaction
function. We find that the dynamic edge weights can have a significant impact
on the opinion formation process, since they may result in consensus formation
but can also reinforce polarisation. Overall, the proposed modelling approach
allows us to quantify and investigate how the network and opinion dynamics
influence each other.

field and has only a very tenuous atmosphere (exosphere). These three
conditions result in a direct coupling between the plasma emitted from the Sun
(namely the solar wind) and Mercury's surface. The planet's magnetic field
leads to a non-trivial pattern of plasma precipitation onto the surface, that
is expected to contribute to the alteration of the regolith over geological
time scales. The goal of this work is to study the solar wind plasma
precipitation onto the surface of Mercury from a geographical perspective, as
opposed to the local-time-of-day approach of previous precipitation modeling
studies. We employ solar wind precipitation maps for protons and electrons from
two fully-kinetic numerical simulations of Mercury's plasma environment. These
maps are then integrated over two full Mercury orbits (176 Earth days). We
found that the plasma precipitation pattern at the surface is most strongly
affected by the upstream solar wind conditions, particularly by the
interplanetary magnetic field direction, and less by Mercury's 3:2 spin-orbit
resonance. We also found that Mercury's magnetic field is able to shield the
surface from roughly 90% of the incoming solar wind flux. At the surface,
protons have a broad energy distribution from below 500 eV to more than 1.5
keV; while electrons are mostly found in the range 0.1-4 keV. These results
will help to better constrain space weathering and exosphere source processes

Neutrino transport is an essential part of the simulation of these phenomena,
and modern codes are able to implement inelastic neutrino scattering and also
to some extent its angle distribution. We therefore study the energy and angle
dependence of neutrino scattering rates in proto-neutron star and supernova
matter with the full Skyrme RPA response functions. We confirm earlier findings
obtained in the Landau approximation that the RPA reduces neutrino scattering,
but the detailed differential scattering rates in hot and dense matter depend
sensitively on the adopted interaction. The scattering angle distribution is
different for different interactions because it depends strongly on the neutron
Fermi velocity. We also find that many Skyrme interactions present an
unphysical feature that the Fermi velocity of neutrons exceeds the speed of
light already at relatively low densities.

high-level features by contrastive learning strategy. In this approach,
features and logical labels belonging to the same sample are pulled closer,
while those of different samples are projected farther away from each other in

substantially smaller ontology that preserves all entailments for a

reuse and ontology analysis. Different from classical modules, general modules
may use axioms not explicitly present in the input ontology, which allows for
additional conciseness. So far, general modules have only been investigated for
lightweight description logics. We present the first work that considers the
more expressive description logic ALC. In particular, our contribution is a new
method based on uniform interpolation supported by some new theoretical
results. Our evaluation indicates that our general modules are often smaller
than classical modules and uniform interpolants computed by the
state-of-the-art, and compared with uniform interpolants, can be computed in a
significantly shorter time. Moreover, our method can be used for, and in fact
improves, the computation of uniform interpolants and classical modules.

  Computer Vision (ECV). Code: https://github.com/visinf/cad",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many convolutional neural networks (CNNs) rely on progressive downsampling of
their feature maps to increase the network's receptive field and decrease
computational cost. However, this comes at the price of losing granularity in
the feature maps, limiting the ability to correctly understand images or
recover fine detail in dense prediction tasks. To address this, common practice
is to replace the last few downsampling operations in a CNN with dilated
convolutions, allowing to retain the feature map resolution without reducing
the receptive field, albeit increasing the computational cost. This allows to
trade off predictive performance against cost, depending on the output feature
resolution. By either regularly downsampling or not downsampling the entire
feature map, existing work implicitly treats all regions of the input image and
subsequent feature maps as equally important, which generally does not hold. We
propose an adaptive downsampling scheme that generalizes the above idea by
allowing to process informative regions at a higher resolution than less
informative ones. In a variety of experiments, we demonstrate the versatility
of our adaptive downsampling strategy and empirically show that it improves the
cost-accuracy trade-off of various established CNNs.

a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain

text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task
into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter
generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which
a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and

daily lives. However, due to the limitations of photographic equipments and
techniques, UGC videos often contain various degradations, in which one of the
most visually unfavorable effects is the underexposure. Therefore,
corresponding video enhancement algorithms such as Low-Light Video Enhancement
(LLVE) have been proposed to deal with the specific degradation. However,
different from video enhancement algorithms, almost all existing Video Quality
Assessment (VQA) models are built generally rather than specifically, which
measure the quality of a video from a comprehensive perspective. To the best of
our knowledge, there is no VQA model specially designed for videos enhanced by
LLVE algorithms. To this end, we first construct a Low-Light Video Enhancement
Quality Assessment (LLVE-QA) dataset in which 254 original low-light videos are
collected and then enhanced by leveraging 8 LLVE algorithms to obtain 2,060
videos in total. Moreover, we propose a quality assessment model specialized in
LLVE, named Light-VQA. More concretely, since the brightness and noise have the
most impact on low-light enhanced VQA, we handcraft corresponding features and
integrate them with deep-learning-based semantic features as the overall
spatial information. As for temporal information, in addition to
deep-learning-based motion features, we also investigate the handcrafted
brightness consistency among video frames, and the overall temporal information
is their concatenation. Subsequently, spatial and temporal information is fused
to obtain the quality-aware representation of a video. Extensive experimental
results show that our Light-VQA achieves the best performance against the
current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) on LLVE-QA and public dataset. Dataset and

precisely matching experimental spectra to library spectra with excellent

sequential dependency in comparison to images, and the majority of existing
language models are trained with a left-to-right auto-regressive approach. To
account for the inherent sequential characteristic of natural language, we
introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion). AR-Diffusion ensures that
the generation of tokens on the right depends on the generated ones on the
left, a mechanism achieved through employing a dynamic number of denoising
steps that vary based on token position. This results in tokens on the left
undergoing fewer denoising steps than those on the right, thereby enabling them
to generate earlier and subsequently influence the generation of tokens on the
right. In a series of experiments on various text generation tasks, including
text summarization, machine translation, and common sense generation,
AR-Diffusion clearly demonstrated its superiority over existing diffusion
language models and that it can be $100\times\sim600\times$ faster when

investigates the space, fidelity and time resources of various NISQ algorithms

intervention that can be used by social media users to refute misleading

visibility and distrust towards professional fact-checkers. As a remedy,
Twitter launched its community-based fact-checking system Community Notes on
which fact-checks are carried out by actual Twitter users and directly shown on
the fact-checked tweets. Yet, an understanding of how fact-checking via
Community Notes differs from snoping is absent. In this study, we analyze
differences in how contributors to Community Notes and Snopers select their
targets when fact-checking social media posts. For this purpose, we analyze two
unique datasets from Twitter: (a) 25,917 community-created fact-checks from
Twitter's Community Notes platform; and (b) 52,505 ""snopes"" that debunk tweets
via fact-checking replies linking to professional fact-checking websites. We
find that Notes contributors and Snopers focus on different targets when
fact-checking social media content. For instance, Notes contributors tend to
fact-check posts from larger accounts with higher social influence and are
relatively less likely to endorse/emphasize the accuracy of not misleading
posts. Fact-checking targets of Notes contributors and Snopers rarely overlap;
however, those overlapping exhibit a high level of agreement in the
fact-checking assessment. Moreover, we demonstrate that Snopers fact-check
social media posts at a higher speed. Altogether, our findings imply that
different fact-checking approaches -- carried out on the same social media
platform -- can result in vastly different social media posts getting
fact-checked. This has important implications for future research on
misinformation, which should not rely on a single fact-checking approach when
compiling misinformation datasets.

It can obtain good tracking results when using excellent detectors but it may
associate wrong targets when facing overlapping and low-confidence detections.
To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-object tracker based on
shape constraint and confidence named SCTracker. In the data association stage,
an Intersection of Union distance with shape constraints is applied to
calculate the cost matrix between tracks and detections, which can effectively
avoid the track tracking to the wrong target with the similar position but
inconsistent shape, so as to improve the accuracy of data association.
Additionally, the Kalman Filter based on the detection confidence is used to
update the motion state to improve the tracking performance when the detection
has low confidence. Experimental results on MOT 17 dataset show that the
proposed method can effectively improve the tracking performance of
multi-object tracking.

(HSS) affected the low-energy ion component ($\lesssim 5$ MeV) of the gradual
SEP event at both Bepi and ACE, despite the HSS having only a modest solar wind
speed increase. Using the EUHFORIA (European Heliospheric FORecasting

during the event and the coronal mass ejection (CME) that generated it. We then
combine these results with the energetic particle transport model PARADISE
(PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration). We
find that the structure of the CME-driven shock was affected by the non-uniform
solar wind, especially near the HSS, resulting in a shock wavefront with strong
variations in its properties such as its compression ratio and obliquity. By
scaling the emission of energetic particles from the shock to the solar wind
compression at the shock, an excellent match between the PARADISE simulation

shows that the intricate intensity variations observed at both ACE and Bepi

IRSA-based schemes are considered here as an instance of the class of unsourced
slotted random access codes, operating over a frame partitioned in time slots,
and are obtained by concatenation of a medium access control layer code over
the entire frame and a physical layer code over each slot. In this framework,
an asymptotic analysis is carried out in presence of both collisions and slot
decoding errors due to channel noise, which allows the derivation of
density-evolution equations, asymptotic limits for minimum packet loss
probability and average load threshold, and a converse bound for threshold
values. This analysis is exploited as a tool for the evaluation of performance
limits in terms of minimum signal-to-noise ratio required to achieve a given
packet loss probability, and also provides convergence boundary limits that
hold for any IRSA scheme with given physical layer coding scheme. The tradeoff
between energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency is numerically evaluated
comparing some known coding options, including those achieving random coding

extract specific degradations. For the fine-tuning, we combine the generated

limited in two respects: the number of communication rounds is bounded by a
constant, and the number of computation steps of each computer is polynomially
bounded by the size of its local input and the messages it receives. By letting
two players take turns assigning certificates to the computers, we obtain a
generalization of the polynomial hierarchy (and hence of the complexity classes
$\mathbf{P}$ and $\mathbf{NP}$). We then extend major results of complexity
theory to this setting, in particular the Cook-Levin theorem (which identifies
Boolean satisfiability as a complete problem for $\mathbf{NP}$), and Fagin's
theorem (which characterizes $\mathbf{NP}$ as the problems expressible in
existential second-order logic). The original results can be recovered as the
special case where the network consists of a single computer. Moreover, perhaps
surprisingly, the task of separating complexity classes becomes easier in the

stateful reactive objects that update their state and transfer crypto-assets in
response to transactions. In this way, they support the development of
contracts in the imperative procedural paradigm, familiar to most programmers.
A drawback of this design choice is that when a user submits a transaction,
they cannot predict in which state it will be executed, exposing them to
transaction-ordering attacks. The UTXO model is an alternative blockchain
design that thwarts these attacks by requiring new transactions to spend past
ones: since transactions have unique identifiers, reordering attacks are
ineffective. Currently, the blockchains following the UTXO model either provide
contracts with limited expressiveness (Bitcoin), or require complex run-time
environments and unfamiliar programming abstractions (Cardano). We present a
framework for smart contracts in the UTXO model, that allows expressive
contracts to be securely executed by bare-bone UTXO blockchains with loop-free
scripts enriched with covenants, and supports the familiar procedural
programming style.

discuss the challenges newcomers face when joining an OSS project and present
evidence on how hackathons can mitigate those challenges. Method: We conducted
two searches on digital libraries to (1) explore challenges faced by newcomers
to join OSS projects, and (2) collect evidence on how hackathons were used to
address them. We defined four evidence categories (positive, inconclusive, and
no evidence) to classify evidence how hackathons address challenges. In
addition, we investigated whether a hackathon event was related to an OSS
project or not. Result: We identified a range of newcomer challenges that were
successfully addressed using hackathons. However, not all of the solutions we
identified were applied in the context of OSS. Conclusion: There seems to be
potential in using hackathons to overcome newcomers' challenges in OSS projects
and allow them to integrate faster into the project.

circular (cycle) tables and panel (path) tables. For a given seating
arrangement, an agent's utility is the sum of its preference values towards its
(at most two) direct neighbors. An arrangement is envy-free if no agent
strictly prefers someone else's seat, and it is stable if no two agents
strictly prefer each other's seats. We show that it is NP-complete to decide
whether an envy-free arrangement exists for both paths and cycles, even with
binary preferences. In contrast, under the assumption that agents come from a
bounded number of classes, for both topologies, we present polynomial-time
algorithms computing envy-free and stable arrangements, working even for
general preferences. Proving the hardness of computing stable arrangements
seems more difficult, as even constructing unstable instances can be
challenging. To this end, we propose a characterization of the existence of
stable arrangements based on the number of distinct values in the preference
matrix and the number of classes of agents. For two classes of agents, we show
that stability can always be ensured, both for paths and cycles. For cycles, we
moreover show that binary preferences with four classes of agents, as well as
three-valued preferences with three classes of agents, are sufficient to
prevent the existence of a stable arrangement. For paths, the latter still
holds, while we argue that a path-stable arrangement always exists in the
binary case under the additional constraint that agents can only swap seats
when sitting at most two positions away. We moreover consider the swap dynamics
and exhibit instances where they do not converge, despite a stable arrangement
existing.

object instances in the scene with those from a prior map. As far as we know,
this is the first method to use panoptic segmentation directly inferring on 3D
lidar scans for indoor localization. InstaLoc operates through two networks
based on spatially sparse tensors to directly infer dense 3D lidar point
clouds. The first network is a panoptic segmentation network that produces
object instances and their semantic classes. The second smaller network
produces a descriptor for each object instance. A consensus based matching
algorithm then matches the instances to the prior map and estimates a six
degrees of freedom (DoF) pose for the input cloud in the prior map. The
significance of InstaLoc is that it has two efficient networks. It requires
only one to two hours of training on a mobile GPU and runs in real-time at 1

that are deployed at scale and collect from a diverse set of population. One
way to address this concern is by collecting and releasing data labels in an
aggregated manner so that the information about a single user is potentially
combined with others. In this paper, we explore the possibility of training
machine learning models with aggregated data labels, rather than individual
labels. Specifically, we consider two natural aggregation procedures suggested
by practitioners: curated bags where the data points are grouped based on
common features and random bags where the data points are grouped randomly in
bag of similar sizes. For the curated bag setting and for a broad range of loss
functions, we show that we can perform gradient-based learning without any
degradation in performance that may result from aggregating data. Our method is
based on the observation that the sum of the gradients of the loss function on
individual data examples in a curated bag can be computed from the aggregate
label without the need for individual labels. For the random bag setting, we
provide a generalization risk bound based on the Rademacher complexity of the
hypothesis class and show how empirical risk minimization can be regularized to
achieve the smallest risk bound. In fact, in the random bag setting, there is a
trade-off between size of the bag and the achievable error rate as our bound
indicates. Finally, we conduct a careful empirical study to confirm our
theoretical findings. In particular, our results suggest that aggregate

accurate extraction of planetary properties, as well as contributing to our
overall understanding of exoplanetary system architecture. In this analysis, we
examine the photometry of 264 known exoplanet host stars (harboring 337
planetary companions) that were observed during the TESS Prime Mission. We
identify periodic signatures in the light curves of these stars and make
possible connections to stellar pulsations and their rotation periods, and
compare the stellar variability to the published planetary orbital periods.
From these comparisons, we quantify the effects of stellar variability on
exoplanet detection, confirming that exoplanets detection is biased toward
lower variability stars, but larger exoplanets dominate the population of
exoplanets around variable stars. Exoplanet detection methods represented among
these systems are distinct between stellar spectral types across the main
sequence, though notable outliers exist. In addition, biases present in both
the sourced data from TESS and the host star selection process, which strongly
influences the representation of both stellar and planetary characteristics in
the final populations. We also determine whether the host star's photometric
variability affects or mimics the behavior or properties of the system's
planets. These results are discussed in the context of how the behavior of the
host star is responsible for how we observe exoplanet characteristics, most
notably their radii and atmospheric properties, and how the activity may alter
our measurements or impact the evolution of planetary properties.

create software metrics, and reported bugs in the repository are used to gather

suggested, the naive notion of momentum as mass times velocity may not be
right. The Hamiltonian formulation perspective gives exactly such a setting
which in the case of motion of a charged particle under an electromagnetic

the theoretical underpinnings of it are highly ambiguous. To understand the
correlation between disc winds and the dynamics of the accretion flow, we have
performed General Relativistic Magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of an
axisymmetric thin accretion disc with different accretion rates and magnetic
field strengths. Our simulations have shown that the dynamics and the
temperature properties depend on both accretion rates and magnetic field
strengths. We later found that these properties greatly influence spectral
properties. We calculated the average coronal temperature for different
simulation models, which is correlated with high-energy Compton emission. Our
simulation models reveal that the average coronal temperature is
anti-correlated with the accretion rates, which is correlated with the magnetic
field strengths. We also found that the structured component of the disc winds
(Blandford-Payne disc wind) predominates as the accretion rates and magnetic
field strengths increase. In contrast, the turbulent component of the disc
winds ($B_{\rm tor}$ disc wind) predominates as the accretion rates and
magnetic field strengths decrease. Our results suggest that the disc winds

strong explainability for the causal relationship between the neighbour nodes
of the dynamically generated graphs, which can easily lead to a risk in
subsequent decisions. Moreover, few of them consider the uncertainty and noise
of dynamic graphs based on the time series datasets, which are ubiquitous in
real-world graph structure networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Dynamic
Diffusion-Variational Graph Neural Network (DVGNN) for spatio-temporal
forecasting. For dynamic graph construction, an unsupervised generative model
is devised. Two layers of graph convolutional network (GCN) are applied to
calculate the posterior distribution of the latent node embeddings in the
encoder stage. Then, a diffusion model is used to infer the dynamic link
probability and reconstruct causal graphs in the decoder stage adaptively. The
new loss function is derived theoretically, and the reparameterization trick is
adopted in estimating the probability distribution of the dynamic graphs by
Evidence Lower Bound during the backpropagation period. After obtaining the
generated graphs, dynamic GCN and temporal attention are applied to predict
future states. Experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets of
different graph structures in different domains. The results demonstrate that
the proposed DVGNN model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves
outstanding Root Mean Squared Error result while exhibiting higher robustness.
Also, by F1-score and probability distribution analysis, we demonstrate that
DVGNN better reflects the causal relationship and uncertainty of dynamic

capabilities to biological limbs, users report them difficult and non-intuitive
to use. Providing more effective feedback from the device to the user has
therefore become a topic of increased interest. In particular, prediction
learning methods from the field of reinforcement learning -- specifically, an
approach termed Pavlovian signalling -- have been proposed as one approach for
better modulating feedback in prostheses since they can adapt during continuous
use. One challenge identified in these learning methods is that they can forget
previously learned predictions when a user begins to successfully act upon
delivered feedback. The present work directly addresses this challenge,
contributing new evidence on the impact of algorithmic choices, such as on- or
off-policy methods and representation choices, on the Pavlovian signalling from
a machine to a user during their control of a robotic arm. Two conditions of
algorithmic differences were studied using different scenarios of controlling a
robotic arm: an automated motion system and human participant piloting.
Contrary to expectations, off-policy learning did not provide the expected
solution to the forgetting problem. We instead identified beneficial properties
of a look-ahead state representation that made existing approaches able to
learn (and not forget) predictions in support of Pavlovian signalling. This
work therefore contributes new insight into the challenges of providing learned
predictive feedback from a prosthetic device, and demonstrates avenues for more
dynamic signalling in future human-machine interactions.

  Generation from Building Point Clouds",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is a key component of modern
construction engineering and project management workflows. As-is BIM models
that represent the spatial reality of a project site can offer crucial
information to stakeholders for construction progress monitoring, error
checking, and building maintenance purposes. Geometric methods for
automatically converting raw scan data into BIM models (Scan-to-BIM) often fail
to make use of higher-level semantic information in the data. Whereas, semantic
segmentation methods only output labels at the point level without creating
object level models that is necessary for BIM. To address these issues, this
research proposes a hybrid semantic-geometric approach for clutter-resistant
floorplan generation from laser-scanned building point clouds. The input point
clouds are first pre-processed by normalizing the coordinate system and
removing outliers. Then, a semantic segmentation network based on PointNet++ is
used to label each point as ceiling, floor, wall, door, stair, and clutter. The
clutter points are removed whereas the wall, door, and stair points are used
for 2D floorplan generation. A region-growing segmentation algorithm paired
with geometric reasoning rules is applied to group the points together into
individual building elements. Finally, a 2-fold Random Sample Consensus
(RANSAC) algorithm is applied to parameterize the building elements into 2D
lines which are used to create the output floorplan. The proposed method is
evaluated using the metrics of precision, recall, Intersection-over-Union
(IOU), Betti error, and warping error.

high-performance basic linear algebra subroutines (BLAS), which have long
depended on libraries to achieve peak performance on commodity hardware.
High-performance BLAS implementations rely on a layered approach that consists
of tiling and packing layers, for data (re)organization, and micro kernels that
perform the actual computations. The creation of high-performance micro kernels
requires significant development effort to write tailored assembly code for
each architecture. This hand optimization task is complicated by the recent
introduction of matrix engines by IBM's POWER10 MMA, Intel AMX, and Arm ME to
deliver high-performance matrix operations. This paper presents a compiler-only
alternative to the use of high-performance libraries by incorporating, to the
best of our knowledge and for the first time, the automatic generation of the
layered approach into LLVM, a production compiler. Modular design of the
algorithm, such as the use of LLVM's matrix-multiply intrinsic for a clear
interface between the tiling and packing layers and the micro kernel, makes it
easy to retarget the code generation to multiple accelerators. The use of
intrinsics enables a comprehensive performance study. In processors without
hardware matrix engines, the tiling and packing delivers performance up to 22x
(Intel), for small matrices, and more than 6x (POWER9), for large matrices,
faster than PLuTo, a widely used polyhedral optimizer. The performance also
approaches high-performance libraries and is only 34% slower than OpenBLAS and
on-par with Eigen for large matrices. With MMA in POWER10 this solution is, for
large matrices, over 2.6x faster than the vector-extension solution, matches
Eigen performance, and achieves up to 96% of BLAS peak performance.

dipolar supersolid, composed of dipolar droplets arranged on a one-dimensional
(1D) or a two-dimensional (2D) lattice, to establish the robustness of its
crystalline structure under translation and rotation, using a beyond-mean-field
model including a Lee-Huang-Yang interaction. The dipolar atoms are polarized
along the $z$ direction with the supersolid crystalline structure lying in the
$x$-$y$ plane. A stable dipole-mode oscillation was possible in case of both
quasi-1D and quasi-2D dipolar supersolids, whereas a sustained angular
scissors-mode oscillation was possible only in the case of a quasi-1D dipolar
supersolid between a maximum and a minimum of trap anisotropy in the $x$-$y$
plane. In both cases there was no visible deformation of the crystalline
structure of the dipolar supersolid during the oscillation. The theoretical
estimate of the scissors-mode-oscillation frequency was in good agreement with
the present results and the agreement improved with an increase of the number
of droplets in the supersolid and also with an increase in the confining trap
frequencies. The results of this study can be tested experimentally with
present knowhow.

evolution (CEE) where a neutron star (NS) spirals-in inside the envelope of a
red supergiant (RSG) star in a predetermined orbit. We find that the jets shed
pairs of vortices in an expanding spiral pattern, inflate two expanding
spirally-shaped low-density bubbles, one above and one below the equatorial
plane, and deposit angular momentum to the envelope. In the simulation we do
not include the gravity of the NS such that all effects we find are solely due
to the jets that the spiralling-in NS launches. The angular momentum that the
jets deposit to the envelope is of the same order of magnitude as the orbital
angular momentum and has the same direction. The turbulence that the jets
induce in the common envelope might play a role in transporting energy and
angular momentum. The jet-deposited energy that is radiated away (a process not
studied here) leads to a transient event that is termed common envelope jets
supernova (CEJSN) and might mimic an energetic core collapse supernova. The
turbulence and the spiral pattern that we explore here might lead to bumps in
the late light curve of the CEJSN when different segments of the ejected
envelope collide with each other. This study emphasises the roles that jets can
play in CEE (including jets launched by black hole companions) and adds to the
rich variety of processes in CEJSN events.

send messages that completely describe their past observations to every other
agent. While it can be shown that, without loss of generality, we can take an
optimal protocol to be an FIP, full information exchange is impractical to
implement for many applications due to the required message size. We separate
protocols into two parts, the \emph{information-exchange protocol} and the
\emph{action protocol}, so as to be able to examine the effects of more limited
information exchange. We then define a notion of optimality with respect to an
information-exchange protocol. Roughly speaking, an action protocol $P$ is
optimal with respect to an information-exchange protocol $\mathcal{E}$ if, with
$P$, agents decide as soon as possible among action protocols that exchange
information according to $\mathcal{E}$. We present a knowledge-based EBA
program for omission failures all of whose implementations are guaranteed to be
correct and are optimal if the information exchange satisfies a certain safety
condition. We then construct concrete programs that implement this
knowledge-based program in two settings of interest that are shown to satisfy
the safety condition. Finally, we show that a small modification of our program
results in an FIP that is both optimal and efficiently implementable, settling

leveraged to achieve state-of-the-art results on document simplification by
first generating a document-level plan (a sequence of sentence-level

simplification downstream. However, this is still limited in that the
simplification model has no direct access to the local inter-sentence document
context, likely having a negative impact on surface realisation. We explore
various systems that use document context within the simplification process
itself, either by iterating over larger text units or by extending the system
architecture to attend over a high-level representation of document context. In
doing so, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the document

investigate the performance and efficiency tradeoffs of system variants and
make suggestions of when each should be preferred.

we find that the assumption that it produced a GRB170817-like short gamma-ray
burst that went undetected due to the jet geometry is consistent with previous
observations. We find and quantify evidence for low luminosity and wide-angled
jet structuring in the short gamma-ray burst population, independently from
afterglow observations, with log Bayes factors of $0.45{-}0.55$ for such models

developing a self consistent quantum electrostatic simultaneous solver. The
photogeneration phenomenon and carrier transport in nanowire MOS based VTQD
devices is analytically modelled by adopting non equilibrium Greens formalism
based on second quantization field operators for incident photons and generated
photocarriers. Engineering the combined effects of structural and electrical
quantization has enabled a route for developing wavelength selective direct

software framework that consists of three fusion modules. The panoramic stereo
camera with a pentagon shape consists of 5 stereo vision camera pairs to stream
synchronized panoramic stereo images for the following three fusion modules. In
the disparity fusion module, rectified stereo images produce the initial
disparity maps using multiple stereo vision algorithms. Then, these initial
disparity maps, along with the intensity images, are input into a disparity
fusion network to produce refined disparity maps. Next, the refined disparity
maps are converted into full-view point clouds or single-view point clouds for
the pose fusion module. The pose fusion module adopts a two-stage
global-coarse-to-local-fine strategy. In the first stage, each pair of
full-view point clouds is registered by a global point cloud matching algorithm
to estimate the transformation for a global pose graph's edge, which
effectively implements loop closure. In the second stage, a local point cloud
matching algorithm is used to match single-view point clouds in different
nodes. Next, we locally refine the poses of all corresponding edges in the
global pose graph using three proposed rules, thus constructing a refined pose
graph. The refined pose graph is optimized to produce a global pose trajectory
for volumetric fusion. In the volumetric fusion module, the global poses of all
the nodes are used to integrate the single-view point clouds into the volume to
produce the mesh of the whole garden. The proposed framework and its three
fusion modules are tested on a real outdoor garden dataset to show the
superiority of the performance.

Euclidean space can be divided into $n$+1 parts of smaller diameter. Because it
would not make sense otherwise, one usually assumes that he just forgot to
require that the whole set contains at least two points. The hypothesis that
the answer to that question is positive became famous under the name
\emph{Borsuk's conjecture}. Counterexamples are known for any $n\ge 64$, since
2013.
  Let $\Lambda$ the (original, unscaled) Leech lattice, a now very well-known
infinite discrete vector set in the 24-dimensional Euclidean space. The
smallest norm of nonzero vectors in $\Lambda$ is $\sqrt{32}$. Let $M$ the set
of the 196560 vectors in $\Lambda$ having this norm.
  For each $x \in M$, $-x$ is in $M$. Let $H$ the set of all subsets of $M$
that for each $x$ in $M$ contain either $x$ or $-x$. Each element of $H$ has
the same diameter $d = \sqrt{96}$. For dimensions $n<24$ one can analogously
construct respective $M_n$ and $H_n$ from laminated $n$-dimensional sublattices
of $\Lambda$. For uniformity, let $\Lambda_{24}=\Lambda$, $M_{24} = M$ and
$H_{24} = H$.
  If $M_n$ is divisible into at most $n+1$ parts of diameter below $d$ then
this applies to all elements of $H_n$, too. On the other hand, the more the
minimum number of parts of diameter below $d$ that $M_n$ can be divided into
exceeds $n+1$, the more likely $H_n$ contains a counterexample to Borsuk's
conjecture. For dimensions $n$ from 22 to 24, I could not divide $M_n$ into
less than 28, 32 and 39 parts of diameter below $d$, resp. (I did not find any
applicable result by others).

by applying a cost-benefit analysis combining primary and secondary data

absence it is almost double. If other ecosystem services are included the
constructed wetland scenario reach a BCR of 4 and a ROI of 5, showing a better
performance from a costing perspective than the absence one. In Emilia Romagna,
the constructed wetland scenario shows a high BCR (10) and ROI (9), while the
scenario in absence has obtained a negative present value indicating that the

approach. On the other hand, the poles of the spectral functions at complex
frequencies give the damping rates of the hydrodynamic modes. Since these rates
also depend on the transport coefficients, their values can be compared to the
predictions of the local-equilibrium approach. This comparison is
systematically carried out for the hard-sphere fluid by computing numerically
the transport coefficients, the spectral functions, and their poles as a
function of the wave number in the hydrodynamic limit. The study shows the
consistency between the two approaches for the determination of the transport
properties.

demonstrations performed in robot environments, here we focus on a more
realistic and challenging setup with demonstrations recorded in natural and
diverse human environments. We propose Video-conditioned Policy learning (ViP),
a data-driven approach that maps human demonstrations of previously unseen
tasks to robot manipulation skills. To this end, we learn our policy to
generate appropriate actions given current scene observations and a video of
the target task. To encourage generalization to new tasks, we avoid particular
tasks during training and learn our policy from unlabelled robot trajectories
and corresponding robot videos. Both robot and human videos in our framework
are represented by video embeddings pre-trained for human action recognition.
At test time we first translate human videos to robot videos in the common
video embedding space, and then use resulting embeddings to condition our
policies. Notably, our approach enables robot control by human demonstrations
in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without using robot trajectories paired with human
instructions during training. We validate our approach on a set of challenging
multi-task robot manipulation environments and outperform state of the art. Our
method also demonstrates excellent performance in a new challenging zero-shot

generative search engines, is to incorporate external references to generate
and support their claims. However, evaluating the attribution, i.e., verifying
whether the generated statement is indeed fully supported by the cited

practice, it is costly and time-consuming. In this paper, we investigate the
automatic evaluation of attribution by LLMs. We begin by providing a definition
of attribution and then explore two approaches for automatic evaluation:
prompting LLMs and fine-tuning smaller LMs. The fine-tuning data is repurposed
from related tasks, such as question answering, fact-checking, natural language
inference, and summarization. To facilitate the evaluation, we manually curate
a set of test examples covering 12 domains from a generative search engine, New
Bing. Our results on the curated test set and simulated test examples from
existing benchmark questions highlight both promising signals as well as
remaining challenges for the automatic evaluation of attribution. We hope our

fa\c{c}ade-level semantic segmentation of 3D input data. We present a novel

leverage laser physics and 3D building model priors to probabilistically
identify model conflicts. These probabilistic physical conflicts propose
locations of model openings: Their final semantics and shapes are inferred in a
Bayesian network fusing multimodal probabilistic maps of conflicts, 3D point
clouds, and 2D images. To fulfill demanding LoD3 requirements, we use the
estimated shapes to cut openings in 3D building priors and fit semantic 3D

city campus datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
Scan2LoD3 over the state-of-the-art methods in fa\c{c}ade-level detection,

that BBL has become $n$-type ($p$-type) doped for m-surf = Ag, and Al (= Au). A
thorough structural characterization of the BBL/m-surf interface, using a

preventive measures for the pristine face before foreseeable manipulations. To
complete this forensics ecosystem, we thus put forward the proactive solution
dubbed SepMark, which provides a unified framework for source tracing and
Deepfake detection. SepMark originates from encoder-decoder-based deep
watermarking but with two separable decoders. For the first time the deep
separable watermarking, SepMark brings a new paradigm to the established study
of deep watermarking, where a single encoder embeds one watermark elegantly,
while two decoders can extract the watermark separately at different levels of
robustness. The robust decoder termed Tracer that resists various distortions
may have an overly high level of robustness, allowing the watermark to survive
both before and after Deepfake. The semi-robust one termed Detector is
selectively sensitive to malicious distortions, making the watermark disappear
after Deepfake. Only SepMark comprising of Tracer and Detector can reliably
trace the trusted source of the marked face and detect whether it has been
altered since being marked; neither of the two alone can achieve this.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SepMark on
typical Deepfakes, including face swapping, expression reenactment, and
attribute editing.

CMB surveys. However, cluster-correlated foreground signals, like the kinematic
and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ and tSZ) signals, present a challenge when
extracting the lensing signal from CMB temperature data. While CMB
polarization-based lensing reconstruction is one way to mitigate these
foreground biases, the sensitivity from CMB temperature-based reconstruction is
expected to be similar to or higher than polarization for future surveys. In
this work, we extend the cluster lensing estimator developed in Raghunathan et

leading technology for quantum light generation. However, efficiently coupling
their emission into a single mode fiber or Gaussian beam often remains
challenging. Here, we use direct laser writing (DLW) to address this challenge
by fabricating 1 $\mu$m diameter polymer nanowires (PNWs) in-contact-with and
perpendicular-to a QD-containing GaAs layer. QD emission is coupled to the
PNW's HE$_{11}$ waveguide mode, enhancing collection efficiency into a
single-mode fiber. PNW fabrication does not alter the QD device layer, making
PNWs well-suited for augmenting preexisting in-plane geometries. We study
standalone PNWs and PNWs in conjunction with metallic nanoring devices that
have been previously established for increasing extraction of QD emission. We
report methods that mitigate standing wave reflections and heat, caused by
GaAs's absorption/reflection of the lithography beam, which otherwise prevent
PNW fabrication. We observe a factor of $(3.0 \pm 0.7)\times$ improvement in a
nanoring system with a PNW compared to the same system without a PNW, in line
with numerical results, highlighting the PNW's ability to waveguide QD emission
and increase collection efficiency simultaneously. These results demonstrate
new DLW functionality in service of quantum emitter photonics that maintains
compatibility with existing top-down fabrication approaches.

proposed model is analyzed in detail to assess whether it can reflect very
different states of the economy. Basing on those results, measures of systemic
risk are constructed to provide information regarding the stability of the

the explanation of causal relationships between the phases expressed in terms
of parameters derived from real-world quantities. The framework can be

behavior under potentially extreme stochastic loads expressed in terms of
failure probabilities against stated criteria. As a result, efficient
stochastic simulation schemes are central to computational frameworks that aim
to estimate failure probabilities associated with multiple limit states using
limited sample sets. In this work, a generalized stratified sampling scheme is
proposed in which two phases of sampling are involved: the first is devoted to
the generation of strata-wise samples and the estimation of strata
probabilities whereas the second aims at the estimation of strata-wise failure
probabilities. Phase-I sampling enables the selection of a generalized
stratification variable (i.e., not necessarily belonging to the input set of
random variables) for which the probability distribution is not known a priori.
To improve the efficiency, Markov Chain Monte Carlo Phase-I sampling is
proposed when Monte Carlo simulation is deemed infeasible and optimal Phase-II
sampling is implemented based on user-specified target coefficients of
variation for the limit states of interest. The expressions for these
coefficients are derived with due regard to the sample correlations induced by
the Markov chains and the uncertainty in the estimated strata probabilities.
The proposed stochastic simulation scheme reaps the benefits of near-optimal
stratified sampling for a broader choice of stratification variables in
high-dimensional reliability problems with a mechanism to approximately control
the accuracy of the failure probability estimators. The practicality of the
scheme is demonstrated using two examples involving the estimation of failure
probabilities associated with highly nonlinear responses induced by wind and
seismic excitations.

stars (including the most realistic background structure and microphysical
ingredients so far) applied to a very complex initial magnetic field topology
in the crust, similar to what recently obtained by proto-neutron star dynamo
simulations. In such configurations, most of the energy is stored in the
toroidal field, while the dipolar component is a few percent of the mean
magnetic field. This initial feature is maintained during the long-term
evolution (1e6 yr), since the Hall term favours a direct cascade (compensating
for Ohmic dissipation) rather than a strong inverse cascade, for such an
initial field topology. The surface dipolar component, responsible for the
dominant electromagnetic spin-down torque, does not show any increase in time,
when starting from this complex initial topology. This is at contrast with the
timing properties of young pulsars and magnetars which point to higher values
of the surface dipolar fields. A possibility is that the deep-seated magnetic
field (currents in the core) is able to self-organize in large scales (during
the collapse or in the early life of a neutron star). Alternatively, the
dipolar field might be lower than is usually thought, with magnetosphere
substantially contributing to the observed high spin-down, via e.g., strong
winds or strong coronal magnetic loops, which can also provide a natural
explanation to the tiny surface hotspots inferred from X-ray data.

sufficient information for enhancing structured understanding of VL models? We
show that it is indeed possible to improve VL models using such data by
utilizing a specialized model architecture and a new training paradigm. Our
approach captures structure-related information for both the visual and textual
encoders by directly supervising both components when learning from SG labels.
We use scene graph supervision to generate fine-grained captions based on
various graph augmentations highlighting different compositional aspects of the
scene, and to predict SG information using an open vocabulary approach by
adding special ``Adaptive SG tokens'' to the visual encoder. Moreover, we
design a new adaptation technique tailored specifically to the SG tokens that

questions by reasoning over knowledge provided as part of the context (i.e.,
in-context reasoning). However, since the available knowledge is often not
filtered for a particular question, in-context reasoning can be sensitive to
distractor facts, additional content that is irrelevant to a question but that
may be relevant for a different question (i.e., not necessarily random noise).
In these situations, the model fails to distinguish the knowledge that is
necessary to answer the question, leading to spurious reasoning and degraded
performance. This reasoning failure contrasts with the model's apparent ability
to distinguish its contextual knowledge from all the knowledge it has memorized
during pre-training. Following this observation, we propose teaching the model
to reason more robustly by folding the provided contextual knowledge into the
model's parameters before presenting it with a question. Our method, RECKONING,
is a bi-level learning algorithm that teaches language models to reason by
updating their parametric knowledge through back-propagation, allowing them to
then answer questions using the updated parameters. During training, the inner
loop rapidly adapts a copy of the model weights to encode contextual knowledge
into its parameters. In the outer loop, the model learns to use the updated
weights to reproduce and answer reasoning questions about the memorized
knowledge. Our experiments on two multi-hop reasoning datasets show that
RECKONING's performance improves over the in-context reasoning baseline (by up
to 4.5%). We also find that compared to in-context reasoning, RECKONING
generalizes better to longer reasoning chains unseen during training, is more
robust to distractors in the context, and is more computationally efficient
when multiple questions are asked about the same knowledge.

taken with the MEGARA spectrograph at GTC. We fit the emission lines with a
maximum of two Gaussian components, except at the AGN position where we used
three. Aided by existing stellar kinematics, we use the observed velocity and
velocity dispersion of the emission lines to classify the different kinematic
components. The disc component is characterised by lines with $\sigma \sim
60-200\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. The outflow component has typical values of
$\sigma \sim 700\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ and is confined to the central 400 pc,
which is coincident with linear part of the radio jet detected in NGC 2110. At
the AGN position, the [O III]$\lambda$5007 line shows high velocity components
reaching at least $1000\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. This and the high velocity
dispersions indicate the presence of outflowing gas outside the galaxy plane.
Spatially-resolved diagnostic diagrams reveal mostly LI(N)ER-like excitation in
the outflow and some regions in the disc, which could be due to the presence of
shocks. However, there is also Seyfert-like excitation beyond the bending of
the radio jet, probably tracing the edge of the ionisation cone that intercepts
with the disc of the galaxy. NGC 2110 follows well the observational trends
between the outflow properties and the jet radio power found for a few nearby
Seyfert galaxies. All these pieces of information suggest that part of observed
ionised outflow in NGC 2110 might be driven by the radio jet. However, the
radio jet was bent at radial distances of 200 pc (in projection) from the AGN,
and beyond there, most of the gas in the galaxy disc is rotating.

relevant to quantum many-body physics. In these models, gauge and electric
fields are represented by spin-$S$ operators. So far, large-scale realizations
of QLMs have been restricted to $S=1/2$ representations, whereas the
lattice-QED limit is approached at $S\to\infty$. Here, we present a bosonic

we then propose an experimental scheme for the realization of a large-scale

Using perturbation theory and infinite matrix product state calculations, which
work directly in the thermodynamic limit, we demonstrate the faithfulness of
the mapping and stability of gauge invariance throughout all accessible

simulator to address relevant high-energy physics by probing the
(de)confinement of an electron--positron pair by tuning the gauge coupling. Our
work provides an essential step towards gauge-theory quantum simulators in the

of galaxies: from one UDG that shows no signs of dark matter, to UDGs that
follow the luminosity-dispersion relation of early-type galaxies, to the most
extreme examples of heavily dark matter dominated galaxies that break
well-known scaling relations such as the luminosity-dispersion or the U-shaped
total mass-to-light ratio relations. This is indicative of a number of
mechanisms at play forming these peculiar galaxies. Some of them may be the
most extended version of dwarf galaxies, while others are so extreme that they
seem to populate dark matter halos consistent with that of the Milky-Way or
even larger. Even though Milky-Way stars and other GC interlopers contaminating
our sample of GCs cannot be fully ruled-out, our assessment of this potential
problem and simulations indicate that the probability is low and, if present,
unlikely to be enough to explain the extreme dispersions measured. Further
confirmation from stellar kinematics studies in these UDGs would be desirable.
The lack of such extreme objects in any of the state-of-the-art simulations,
opens an exciting avenue of new physics shaping these galaxies.

tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered, is the constant increase in its jet
energy, as implied by radio observations. During the first two hundred days the
jet energy has increased by an order of magnitude. We suggest that the jet was
viewed slightly off-axis. In this case, the apparent energy increase arises due
to the slowing down of the jet and the corresponding broadening of its beaming
cone. Using equipartition analysis, we infer an increasing jet energy as a
larger region of the jet is observed. A simple off-axis model accounts nicely
for the multi-wavelength radio observations, resolving this long-standing
puzzle. The model allows us to self-consistently evolve the synchrotron
signature from an off-axis jet as a function of time. It also allows us to
estimate, for the first time, the beaming angle of the jet, $\theta_0 \approx
21^{\circ}$. This implies that the prompt phase of Swift J1644+57 involved
super Eddington jet luminosity. We also present a closure relation between the
spectral and temporal flux for off-axis jets, which can be used to test whether

fragmentation by employing the concept of quantum Zeno dynamics. We focus on an

interplay of Hilbert space fragmentation with a mirror symmetry, and we show
numerically the effect of breaking the latter. To evince the power of this
perfect disentanglement, we study the effect of generic perturbations around
the fine-tuned model, and show that we can protect against the undesirable
growth of entanglement entropy by using a local Ising interaction on the rungs
of the ladder. This allows us to suppress the entanglement entropy to an

gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational-wave events involving spectacular
black-hole mergers, indicate that the low-metallicity Universe is fundamentally
different from our own Galaxy. Many transient phenomena will remain enigmatic
until we achieve a firm understanding of the physics and evolution of massive
stars at low metallicity (Z). The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits
to observe 250 massive stars at low Z in the ultraviolet (UV) with the COS and
STIS spectrographs under the ULLYSES program. The complementary ``X-Shooting
ULLYSES'' (XShootU) project provides enhanced legacy value with high-quality
optical and near-infrared spectra obtained with the wide-wavelength coverage
X-shooter spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope.
  We present an overview of the XShootU project, showing that combining ULLYSES
UV and XShootU optical spectra is critical for the uniform determination of
stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity,
and abundances, as well as wind properties such as mass-loss rates in function
of Z. As uncertainties in stellar and wind parameters percolate into many
adjacent areas of Astrophysics, the data and modelling of the XShootU project
is expected to be a game-changer for our physical understanding of massive
stars at low Z.
  To be able to confidently interpret James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra

example of a strongly lensed SN with multiple resolved images, were detected in
the MACS J1149 galaxy-cluster field. Following the images' discovery, the SN
was predicted to reappear within hundreds of days at a new position ~8
arcseconds away in the field. The observed reappearance in late 2015 makes it
possible to carry out Refsdal's (1964) original proposal to use a multiply
imaged SN to measure the Hubble constant H0, since the time delay between
appearances should vary inversely with H0. Moreover, the position, brightness,
and timing of the reappearance enable a novel test of the blind predictions of
galaxy-cluster models, which are typically constrained only by the positions of
multiply imaged galaxies. We have developed a new photometry pipeline that uses
DOLPHOT to measure the fluxes of the five images of SN Refsdal from difference
images. We apply four separate techniques to perform a blind measurement of the
relative time delays and magnification ratios (mu_i/mu_1) between the last
image SX and the earlier images S1-S4. We measure the relative time delay of
SX-S1 to be 376.0+5.6-5.5 days and the relative magnification to be
0.30+0.05-0.03. This corresponds to a 1.5% precision on the time delay and 17%
precision for the magnification ratios, and includes uncertainties due to
millilensing and microlensing. In an accompanying paper, we place initial and
blind constraints on the value of the Hubble constant.

generating complex quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) out of simple ones.
We gamify this process and unlock a new avenue for code design and discovery
using reinforcement learning (RL). One benefit of RL is that we can specify
\textit{arbitrary} properties of the code to be optimized. We train on two such
properties, maximizing the code distance, and minimizing the probability of
logical error under biased Pauli noise. For the first, we show that the trained
agent identifies ways to increase code distance beyond naive concatenation,
saturating the linear programming bound for CSS codes on 13 qubits. With a
learning objective to minimize the logical error probability under biased Pauli
noise, we find the best known CSS code at this task for $\lesssim 20$ qubits.
Compared to other (locally deformed) CSS codes, including Surface, XZZX, and 2D
Color codes, our $[[17,1,3]]$ code construction actually has \textit{lower}
adversarial distance, yet better protects the logical information, highlighting
the importance of QECC desiderata. Lastly, we comment on how this RL framework
can be used in conjunction with physical quantum devices to tailor a code
without explicit characterization of the noise model.

accumulate over time, so semi-analytic models suggest that the abundance of
intracluster stars is negligible in young proto-clusters at z~2 and grows to
around a quarter of the stellar mass in the oldest, most mature clusters. In
contrast to these theoretical expectations, we report on the detection of
intracluster light within two proto-clusters at z=2 using deep HST images. We
use the colour of the intracluster light to estimate its mass-to-light ratio in
annuli around the brightest cluster galaxies (BCG), up to a radius of 100 kpc.
We find that $54\pm5$% and $71\pm3$% of the stellar mass in these regions is

sequence of non-commuting parity check operators. They can sometimes exhibit
greater fault-tolerance than conventional subspace codes, which use commuting
checks. However, unlike subspace codes, it is unclear if subsystem codes -- in
particular their advantages -- can be understood in terms of ground state
properties of a physical Hamiltonian. In this paper, we address this question
for the three-dimensional subsystem toric code (3D STC), as recently
constructed by Kubica and Vasmer [Nat. Comm. 13, 6272(2022)], which exhibits
single-shot error correction (SSEC). Motivated by a conjectured relation
between SSEC and thermal stability, we study the zero and finite temperature
phases of an associated non-commuting Hamiltonian. By mapping the Hamiltonian
model to a pair of 3D Z_2 gauge theories coupled by a kinetic constraint, we
find various phases at zero temperature, all separated by first-order
transitions: there are 3D toric code-like phases with deconfined point-like
excitations in the bulk, and there are phases with a confined bulk supporting a
2D toric code on the surface when appropriate boundary conditions are chosen.
The latter is similar to the surface topological order present in 3D STC.
However, the similarities between the SSEC in 3D STC and the confined phases
are only partial: they share the same sets of degrees of freedom, but they are
governed by different dynamical rules. Instead, we argue that the process of
SSEC can more suitably be associated with a path (rather than a point) in the
zero-temperature phase diagram, a perspective which inspires alternative
measurement sequences enabling SSEC. Moreover, since none of the
above-mentioned phases survives at nonzero temperature, SSEC of the code does
not imply thermal stability of the associated Hamiltonian phase.

Appleby-Battye model, or $R^2$-AB model, which consists of an $f(R)$ model with
only one extra free parameter $b$, besides the cosmological parameters of the
flat-$\Lambda$CDM model: $H_0$ and $\Omega_{m,0}$. Regarding this model, it was
already shown that a positive value for $b$ is required for the model to be
consistent with Solar System tests, moreover, the condition for the existence
of a de~Sitter state requires $b \ge 1.6$. To impose observational constraints
on the $R^2$-AB model, we consider in our analyses two data sets: cosmic
chronometer $H(z)$ data for the background level, and $[f\sigma_8](z)$ data,
for the perturbative level. The first one provides $b = 1.6^{+3.1}_{-0.0}$ and
the cosmological parameters $\{H_0 ,\Omega_{m,0}\}$ in agreement to Planck
values, while the second one, indicates $b = 1.76^{+2.91}_{-0.15}$ and the
parameters $\{\Omega_{m,0},\sigma_{8,0} \}$ also in agreement to Planck values;

$b$, for diverse cosmological functions like the Hubble function $H(z)$, the
equation of state $w_{eff}(z)$, the parametrized growth rate of cosmic

Faraday rotation and scattering are especially pronounced at low frequencies

variations in scattering and time-frequency drift rates, and find no evidence

hints of flattening of the gradient of the previously reported secular trend
seen at 600 MHz. The frequency-dependent window of activity at LOFAR appears
stable despite the significant changes in RM, leading us to deduce that these
two effects have different causes. Depolarization of and within individual
bursts towards lower radio frequencies is quantified using LOFAR's large
fractional bandwidth, with some bursts showing no detectable polarization.
However, the degree of depolarization seems uncorrelated to the scattering
timescales, allowing us to evaluate different depolarization models. We discuss

scoring model over (entity, relation, entity)-tuples, for example, by embedding
an initial knowledge graph. Prediction quality can be improved by calibrating
the scoring model, typically by adjusting the prediction thresholds using
manually annotated examples. In this paper, we attempt for the first time
cold-start calibration for KGC, where no annotated examples exist initially for
calibration, and only a limited number of tuples can be selected for
annotation. Our new method ACTC finds good per-relation thresholds efficiently
based on a limited set of annotated tuples. Additionally to a few annotated
tuples, ACTC also leverages unlabeled tuples by estimating their correctness
with Logistic Regression or Gaussian Process classifiers. We also experiment
with different methods for selecting candidate tuples for annotation:
density-based and random selection. Experiments with five scoring models and an
oracle annotator show an improvement of 7% points when using ACTC in the
challenging setting with an annotation budget of only 10 tuples, and an average
improvement of 4% points over different budgets.

the literature, Ce, using stars with asteroseismic constraints from the Kepler,

from precise light curves obtained by the Kepler, K2 and TESS missions with
chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR17 survey and astrometric data from the
Gaia mission. Finally, we compute stellar ages using the code PARAM. We
investigate the different trends of [Ce/Fe] as a function of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe]
and age considering the dependence on the radial position, specially in the
case of K2 targets which cover a large Galactocentric range. We, finally,
explore the [Ce/alpha] ratios as a function of age in different Galactocentric
intervals. The studied trends display a strong dependence of the Ce abundances
on [Fe/H] and star formation history. Indeed, the [Ce/Fe] ratio shows a
non-monotonic dependence on [Fe/H] with a peak around -0.2 dex. Moreover,
younger stars have higher [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] ratios than older stars,
confirming the latest contribution of low- and intermediate-mass asymptotic
giant branch stars to the Galactic chemical enrichment. In addition, the trends
of [Ce/Fe] and [Ce/alpha] with age become steeper moving towards the outer
regions of the Galactic disc, demonstrating a more intense star formation in
the inner regions than in the outer regions. Ce is thus a potentially
interesting element to help constraining stellar yields and the inside-out
formation of the Milky Way disc. However, the large scatter in all the
relations studied here, suggests that spectroscopic uncertainties for this
element are still too large.

bottleneck is responsible for $35-60\%$ of a system's energy consumption during
intra-node communication. In an HPC environment, additional energy is consumed
through inter-node communication. This position paper aims to introduce future
research directions to enter now in the age of energy-aware software. The paper

mechanisms called the sensor observability analysis and the resulting sensor
observability index. The goal is to analyse and evaluate the performance of
robot-mounted distributed directional or axial-based sensors to observe
specific axes in task space as a function of joint configuration. For example,
joint torque sensors are often used in serial robot manipulators and assumed to
be perfectly capable of estimating end effector forces, but certain joint
configurations may cause one or more task-space axes to be unobservable as a
result of how the joint torque sensors are aligned. The proposed sensor
observability analysis provides a method to analyse the cumulative quality of a
robot configuration to observe the task space, akin to forward kinematics for
sensors. The resultant metrics can then be used in optimization and in
null-space control to avoid sensor observability singular configurations or to
maximize sensor observability in particular directions. Parallels are drawn
between sensor observability and the traditional kinematic Jacobian for the
particular case of joint torque sensors in serial robot manipulators. Compared
to kinematic analysis using the Jacobian in serial manipulators, sensor
observability analysis is shown to be more generalizable in terms of analysing
non-joint-mounted sensors and can potentially be applied to sensor types other
than for force sensing, e.g., link-mounted proximity sensors. Simulations and
experiments using a custom 3-DOF robot and the Baxter robot demonstrate the
utility and importance of sensor observability in physical interactions.

generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the
classical Ising model on a graph. Reaching the ground state is equivalent to
finding the maximum (weighted) cut of the graph, which presents the Ising
machines as an alternative way to solving and investigating NP-complete
problems. Among the dynamical models driving the Ising machines,
relaxation-based models are especially interesting because of their relations
with guarantees of performance achieved in time scaling polynomially with the
problem size. However, the terminal states of such machines are essentially
non-binary, which necessitates special post-processing relying on disparate
computing. We show that an Ising machine implementing a special dynamical
system (called \mdII{}) solves the rounding problem dynamically. We prove that
the \mdII-machine starting from an arbitrary non-binary state terminates in a
state, which trivially rounds to a binary state with the cut at least as big as
obtained after the optimal rounding of the initial state. Besides showing that
relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines can be made self-contained, our
findings demonstrate that dynamical systems can directly perform complex
information processing tasks.

introduce an optimization framework to determine personalized CHW visits that
maximize glycemic control at a community-level. Our framework explicitly models
the trade-off between screening new patients and providing management visits to
individuals who are already enrolled in treatment. We account for patients'
motivational states, which affect their decisions to enroll or drop out of
treatment and, therefore, the effectiveness of the intervention. We incorporate
these decisions by modeling patients as utility-maximizing agents within a
bi-level provider problem that we solve using approximate dynamic programming.
By estimating patients' health and motivational states, our model builds visit
plans that account for patients' tradeoffs when deciding to enroll in
treatment, leading to reduced dropout rates and improved resource allocation.
We apply our approach to generate CHW visit plans using operational data from a
social enterprise serving low-income neighborhoods in urban areas of India.
Through extensive simulation experiments, we find that our framework requires
up to 73.4% less capacity than the best naive policy to achieve the same
performance in terms of glycemic control. Our experiments also show that our

However, building high-interaction IoT honeypots is challenging due to the
heterogeneity of IoT devices. Vulnerabilities in IoT devices typically depend
on specific device types or firmware versions, which encourages attackers to
perform pre-attack checks to gather device information before launching
attacks. Moreover, conventional honeypots are easily detected because their
replying logic differs from that of the IoT devices they try to mimic. To
address these problems, we develop an adaptive high-interaction honeypot for
IoT devices, called HoneyIoT. We first build a real device based attack trace

techniques to mutate response values in some fields to generate high-fidelity
responses. HoneyIoT has been deployed on the public Internet. Experimental
results show that HoneyIoT can effectively bypass the pre-attack checks and

can adapt to systems with changing parameters. The proposed method can also
accurately estimate the gradients of risk probabilities, which enables first-

nowadays very common. Despite its broad usage, theories explaining

missing. This work presents a systematic attempt at understanding the role of
the mini-batch size in training two-layer neural networks. Working in the
teacher-student scenario, with a sparse teacher, and focusing on tasks of
different complexity, we quantify the effects of changing the mini-batch size
$m$. We find that often the generalization performances of the student strongly
depend on $m$ and may undergo sharp phase transitions at a critical value
$m_c$, such that for $m<m_c$ the training process fails, while for $m>m_c$ the
student learns perfectly or generalizes very well the teacher. Phase
transitions are induced by collective phenomena firstly discovered in
statistical mechanics and later observed in many fields of science. Finding a
phase transition varying the mini-batch size raises several important questions
on the role of a hyperparameter which have been somehow overlooked until now.

proposed that incorporates droplet soaking, diffusion of molecules within agar,
cell growth over an agar surface, and absorption of signaling molecules by
cells. The proposed model describes the channel response and provides valuable
insights for designing experiments more efficiently and accurately. The
molecule release rate due to droplet soaking into agar, which is characterized
and modeled as the source term for the diffusion model, is derived.
Furthermore, cell growth is considered over the surface, which dictates the
dynamics of signaling molecule reactions and leads to a variable boundary
condition. As a case study, genetically-modified $E.\,coli$ bacteria are spread
over the surface of agar and Isopropyl-beta-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) is
considered as a signaling molecule. IPTG droplets are dropped onto the
bacteria-covered agar surface. The parameters for the IPTG molecule release
rate as a diffusion source into the agar are estimated from this experiment.
Then, a particle-based simulator is used to obtain the spatio-temporal profile
of the signaling molecules received by the surface bacteria. The results
indicate that the number of molecules reacting with or absorbed by bacteria at
different locations on the surface could be widely different, which highlights
the importance of taking this variation into account for biological inferences.

studied in their respective fields, but very little is known about similarities
between these two models, in particular with respect to their critical phase
transition. In this paper, we explore the critical transition behavior of
k-core percolation in random networks. Using the node occupancy rate $p$ as the
control variable and the $k$-core giant component size as the order parameter,
we study the critical exponents of the fluctuations of the critical $p$, $p_c$,
and the order parameter; as well as the critical exponents of the duration of
the plateau breakdown and their scaling behavior. We observe that the
fractality of fluctuations of the giant component found in IN also exists in
k-core percolation, and can be manifested by a fractal fluctuation dimension,
$d_f = 3/4$, within a correlation length $\xi'$ that scales as $\xi' \propto
(p-p_c)^{-\nu'}$, with $\nu' = 2$. We note also that same as in IN, the scaling
behavior of plateau in k-core also scales at $p_c$, as $\left\langle
\tau\right\rangle \propto N^{\psi}$ and near $p_c$, as $\left\langle
\tau\right\rangle \propto(p-p_c)^{-\phi}$, where $\psi=1/3$ and $\phi=1/2$.
These four quantities found here for $k$-core percolation exhibit identical
scaling behaviors as found for IN with the same critical exponents. These
results highly suggest that both systems belong to the same universality class.
In addition, analytical arguments for a universal hyper-scaling relation for
the fractal fluctuation dimension of the $k$-core giant component and for IN as
well as for any mixed-order transition is established. Our investigation
enhances the comprehension of k-core percolation and supports the
generalization of fractal fluctuations in mixed-order phase transitions.

of aspiration and flushing steps, are characterised by a similar success rate
to single-lumen needles, despite their increased cost. A novel
hydrodynamics-based needle is proposed here, which is geared towards the
generation of an internal flow field within the full follicular volume via
laterally, rather than frontally, oriented flushing, leading to successful
retrievals with no additional stress on the oocyte. A digital twin of the
follicular environment is created and tested via multi-phase flow direct
numerical simulations. Oocyte initial location within the follicle is varied,
while quantities of interest such as velocity magnitude and vorticity are
measured with a high level of precision. This provides insight into the overall
fluid motion, as well as the trajectory and stresses experienced by the oocyte.
The new design creates flow fields that affect the entire volume, successfully
steering oocytes that would otherwise be unreachable with traditional needles.
A comparative benchmark set of tests indicated a 100% success rate of the new
needle, a net improvement over the traditional design, with a 66% success rate
in our testing framework. All forces measured during these tests showcase how
the oocyte experiences stresses which are no larger than at the aspiration
point, with the flow field providing a gentle steering effect towards the
extraction region. Finally, the flow generation strategy maximises oocyte
yield, unlocking new capabilities in both the human and veterinary contexts.

significant vector for security attacks. Much of this malicious behavior can be
traced to a lack of strong authentication for software. To mitigate this
problem, digital signatures provide confidence in the authenticity and
authorization for signers of the software, but introduce privacy problems by
exposing maintainers' personally identifiable information. The contribution of
this project, Speranza, is to allow for verification of authenticity for
software packages in a repository while providing anonymity to signers through
the use of zero-knowledge identity co-commitments.
  In Speranza, a signer uses an automated certificate authority (CA) to create
a private identity-backed signature and proof of authorization. Verifiers check
that a signer was authorized to publish a package, without learning the
signer's identity. The package repository keeps a private mapping from package
names to the identities of authorized signers, but publishes only commitments
to identities in a public map. When issuing certificates, the CA issues the
certificate to a distinct commitment to the same identity. The signer then
creates a zero-knowledge proof of a commitment that these are identity
co-commitments.
  We implemented a proof-of-concept, finding that costs to maintainers
(signing) and end users (verifying) are small, even for a repository with
millions of packages: 404 us and 372 us, respectively. End users must learn the
authorization policy in order to verify packages. In a naive approach, they
must download the policy for every package in advance (possibly 100 MiB total,
or more); we use techniques inspired by recent key transparency systems to
reduce this to 2 KiB. Server costs in this system are negligible. Our
evaluation finds that Speranza is practical on the scale of the largest
software repositories.

can be practically inconvenient, since the Laplace approximation may require an
intractable integral to compute the marginal log posterior, and the bootstrap
requires computing the posterior for many different bootstrap datasets. We
develop and explore the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ), an alternative method for
computing asymptotic frequentist covariance of smooth functionals of

statistics. We show that the influence function for posterior expectations has
the form of a simple posterior covariance, and that the IJ covariance estimate
is, in turn, easily computed from a single set of posterior samples. Under
conditions similar to those required for a Bayesian central limit theorem to
apply, we prove that the corresponding IJ covariance estimate is asymptotically
equivalent to the Laplace approximation and the bootstrap. In the presence of
nuisance parameters that may not obey a central limit theorem, we argue
heuristically that the IJ covariance can remain a good approximation to the
limiting frequentist variance. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational
benefits of the IJ covariance estimates with simulated and real-world
experiments.

channel, it is crucial that SBC security is composable, i.e., it is preserved
under concurrent protocol executions. The work of [Hevia, SCN 2006] proposes a
formal treatment of SBC in the Universal Composability (UC) framework [Canetti,
FOCS 2001] and a construction secure assuming an honest majority. In this work,
we provide a comprehensive revision of SBC in the UC setting and improve the
results of [Hevia, SCN 2006]. In particular, we present a new SBC functionality
that captures both simultaneity and liveness by considering a broadcast period
such that (i) within this period all messages are broadcast independently and
(ii) after the period ends, the session is terminated without requiring
participation of all parties. Next, we employ time-lock encryption (TLE) over a
standard broadcast channel to devise an SBC protocol that realizes our
functionality against any adaptive adversary corrupting up to all-but-one
parties. In our study, we capture synchronicity via a global clock [Katz et
al., TCC 2013], thus lifting the restrictions of the original synchronous
communication setting used in [Hevia, SCN 2006]. As a building block of

  Redundancy, and Identifiability","13 pages",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the combined role of transmit waveforms and (sparse)
sensor array geometries in active sensing multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
systems. Specifically, we consider the fundamental identifiability problem of
uniquely recovering the unknown scatterer angles and coefficients from
noiseless spatio-temporal measurements. Assuming a sparse scene,
identifiability is determined by the Kruskal rank of a highly structured
sensing matrix, which depends on both the transmitted waveforms and the array
configuration. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that the array
geometry and transmit waveforms need to satisfy for the Kruskal rank -- and
hence identifiability -- to be maximized. Moreover, we propose waveform designs
that maximize identifiability for common array configurations. We also provide
novel insights on the interaction between the waveforms and array geometry. A
key observation is that waveforms should be matched to the pattern of redundant
transmit-receive sensor pairs. Redundant array configurations are commonly
employed to increase noise resilience, robustify against sensor failures, and
improve beamforming capabilities. Our analysis also clearly shows that a
redundant array is capable of achieving its maximum identifiability using fewer
linearly independent waveforms than transmitters. This has the benefit of
lowering hardware costs and transmission time. We illustrate our findings using
multiple examples with unit-modulus waveforms, which are often preferred in
practice.

datasets often have a prohibitive computational cost that bottlenecks clinical
deployment, especially for 3D non-Cartesian acquisitions. One common approach
is to reduce the number of coil channels actively used during reconstruction as
in coil compression. While effective for Cartesian imaging, coil compression
inherently loses signal energy, producing shading artifacts that compromise
image quality for 3D non-Cartesian imaging. We propose coil sketching, a
general and versatile method for computationally-efficient iterative MR image
reconstruction.
  Theory and Methods: We based our method on randomized sketching algorithms, a
type of large-scale optimization algorithms well established in the fields of
machine learning and big data analysis. We adapt the sketching theory to the
MRI reconstruction problem via a structured sketching matrix that, similar to
coil compression, reduces the number of coils concurrently used during
reconstruction, but unlike coil compression, is able to leverage energy from
all coils.
  Results: First, we performed ablation experiments to validate the sketching
matrix design on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian datasets. The resulting
design yielded both improved computational efficiency and preserved
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as measured by the inverse g-factor. Then, we
verified the efficacy of our approach on high-dimensional non-Cartesian 3D
cones datasets, where coil sketching yielded up to three-fold faster
reconstructions with equivalent image quality.
  Conclusion: Coil sketching is a general and versatile reconstruction
framework for computationally fast and memory-efficient reconstruction.

to assuming a Gaussian model when a non-Gaussian modulation was used, and
develop relevant properties for it. We show that if the set of coherent states
is induced by a random variable approaching the AWGN channel capacity, then the
protocol's non-Gaussianity vanishes, meaning that there is no loss of secret
key rate due to the use of a Gaussian model for computing bound on the secret

waves and sea ice meet. Waves play a fundamental role in this coupled system,
but progress in our understanding of wave-ice interactions is currently
hindered by the lack of observations of sea ice properties in-situ. In this
study we aim to estimate the ice thickness and effective elastic modulus of sea
ice passively using observations of waves in ice. Specifically, we use three
low-cost geophones deployed in triangular formation with sides of about 200 m
on fast ice. The focus here is on three major wave events recorded, each
consisting of initial high frequency vibrations with a frequency at around 10
Hz, followed by low frequency dispersive waves within a frequency range of
0.08-0.28 Hz. Based on the phase speed of the initial high frequency
vibrations, we estimate the purely elastic effective modulus to be 4-4.5 GPa.
By comparing the arrival times of the dispersive low frequency wave events to
the dispersion relationship of waves in a thin elastic ice sheet we obtain
estimates of the effective elastic modulus in the range of 0.4-0.7 GPa. This is
close to the measured effective elastic modulus through cantilever experiments
of 0.5 GPa but considerably smaller than the default value of 5.5 GPa currently
in use in contemporary wave models. We could not, however, obtain explicit
estimates of the ice thickness and effective modulus individually as their
impacts on the shape of the dispersion relationship are similar in this
frequency range. Distinction is only possible for dispersive wave events larger
than about 1 Hz, such as for vibrations generated by (thermal) cracking, which
are frequently observed in our dataset. With our results, we show that low-cost
geophones can be used to estimate sea ice properties in fast ice and
substantiate that this to be possible on very large ice floes as well.

the velocity field and the normal components of the magnetic field are defined

velocity field and of the magnetic field in a rather natural manner. The
non-linear convective and the viscous terms are solved at the aid of an
explicit FV scheme, while the magnetic field is evolved in a divergence-free

However, building general-purpose vision-language models is challenging due to
the increased task discrepancy introduced by the additional visual input.
Although vision-language pre-training has been widely studied, vision-language
instruction tuning remains relatively less explored. In this paper, we conduct
a systematic and comprehensive study on vision-language instruction tuning
based on the pre-trained BLIP-2 models. We gather a wide variety of 26 publicly
available datasets, transform them into instruction tuning format and
categorize them into two clusters for held-in instruction tuning and held-out
zero-shot evaluation. Additionally, we introduce instruction-aware visual
feature extraction, a crucial method that enables the model to extract
informative features tailored to the given instruction. The resulting
InstructBLIP models achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across all
13 held-out datasets, substantially outperforming BLIP-2 and the larger
Flamingo. Our models also lead to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned
on individual downstream tasks (e.g., 90.7% accuracy on ScienceQA IMG).
Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate the advantages of InstructBLIP over
concurrent multimodal models. All InstructBLIP models have been open-sourced at

the posterior of the spherical-harmonic components of the intensity map,
without assuming the background possesses any specific angular structure. The
key idea is to realize that the likelihood function is a multivariable Gaussian
of the spherical-harmonic components of the energy spectrum of the
gravitational-wave background. If a uniform and wide prior of these
spherical-harmonic components is prescribed, the marginalized posterior and the
Bayes factor can be well approximated by a high-dimensional Gaussian integral.
The analytical marginalization allows us to regard the spherical-harmonic
components of the intensity map of the background as free parameters, and to
construct their individual marginalized posterior distribution in a reasonable
time, even though many spherical-harmonic components are required. The
marginalized posteriors can, in turn, be used to accurately construct the
intensity map of the background. By applying our method to mock data, we show
that we can recover precisely the angular structures of various simulated
anisotropic backgrounds, without assuming prior knowledge of the relation
between the spherical-harmonic components predicted by a given model. Our
method allows us to bypass the time-consuming numerical sampling of a
high-dimensional posterior, leading to a more model-independent and untargeted

astrophysical sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is an essential tool for
finding evidences of new theories of quantum gravity (QG) that predict
energy-dependent speed of light. Such a search has its own difficulties, so
usually, the effect of the cosmological model is understudied and the default
model is a fixed-parameters $\Lambda$CDM. In this work, we use different
astrophysical datasets to study the effect of a number of dark energy models on
the LIV constrains. To this end, we combine two public time-delay GRB datasets
with the supernovae Pantheon dataset, a number of angular baryonic acoustic
oscillations (BAO), the cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance prior and a
GRB or quasars dataset. We find for $\alpha$ the expected average value of
$\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to $E_{QG}\ge 10^{17}$ GeV for both
time-delay (TD) datasets, with the second one being more sensitive to the
cosmological model. We find that the cosmology amounts to at least 20\%
deviation in our constraints on the energy. Also interestingly, adding the TD
points makes the DE models less-preferable statistically and shifts the value
of the parameter $c/(H_0 r_d)$ down, making it smaller than the expected value.
We see that possible LIV measurements depend critically on the transparency of
the assumptions behind the published data with respect to cosmology and that
taking it into account may be important contribution in the case of possible
detection.

detected THz angular distribution is usually conical with a dip in the laser
propagation axis which is unfavorable for its application, and the formation of
an oscillating tail in the THz waveform has not yet been well understood. Here,
we develop an electric field element interference model in which each local
current source has a phase velocity determined by the laser pulse and a
Gaussian temporal profile, rather than an ideal point source, as well as the
current oscillation caused by the plasma dynamics is considered. By introducing
the temporal interference, effects of the phase velocity and the Gaussian
profile of the current can correct the THz angular distribution. Therefore, by
adjusting the laser pulse duration and the group velocity, the THz angular
distribution can be controlled and the dip could be even eliminated. Besides,
the plasma dynamics can result in the formation of an oscillating tail in the
THz waveform and sunken spikes in the corresponding spectrum. This is similar
to the experimental results which are usually explained by the water vapor
absorption. In turn, the spikes in the spectrum could provide a way to measure

needed to solve obstruction-free consensus among $n$ processes. This lower
bound was improved to $n$ registers in 2018, which exactly matches the best
upper bound. The $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space complexity lower bound actually
applies to a class of objects called historyless objects, which includes
registers, test-and-set objects, and readable swap objects. However, every
known $n$-process obstruction-free consensus algorithm from historyless objects
uses $\Omega (n)$ objects.
  We give the first $\Omega (n)$ space complexity lower bounds on consensus
algorithms for two kinds of historyless objects. First, we show that any
obstruction-free consensus algorithm from swap objects uses at least $n-1$
objects. More generally, we prove that any obstruction-free $k$-set agreement
algorithm from swap objects uses at least $\lceil \frac{n}{k}\rceil - 1$
objects. This is the first non-constant lower bound on the space complexity of
solving $k$-set agreement with swap objects when $k > 1$. We also present an
obstruction-free $k$-set agreement algorithm from $n-k$ swap objects, exactly
matching our lower bound when $k=1$.
  Second, we show that any obstruction-free binary consensus algorithm from
readable swap objects with domain size $b$ uses at least $\frac{n-2}{3b+1}$
objects. Since any historyless object can be simulated by a readable swap
object with the same domain, our results imply that any obstruction-free
consensus algorithm from historyless objects with domain size $b$ uses at least
$\frac{n-2}{3b+1}$ objects. For $b = 2$, we show a slightly better lower bound
of $n-2$. The best known obstruction-free binary consensus algorithm from

digital images is a key goal of digital rock physics (DRP). Direct numerical
simulation (DNS) of elastic behavior, however, incurs high computational cost;
and surrogate machine learning (ML) model, particularly convolutional neural
network (CNN), show promises to accelerate homogenization process. 3D CNN
models, however, are unable to handle large images due to memory issues. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel method that combines 3D CNN with
hierarchical homogenization method (HHM). The surrogate 3D CNN model
homogenizes only small subimages, and a DNS is used to homogenize the
intermediate image obtained by assembling small subimages. The 3D CNN model is
designed to output the homogenized elastic constants within the
Hashin-Shtrikman (HS) bounds of the input images. The 3D CNN model is first
trained on data comprising equal proportions of five sandstone (quartz
mineralogy) images, and, subsequently, fine-tuned for specific rocks using
transfer learning. The proposed method is applied to homogenize the rock images
of size 300x300x300 and 600x600x600 voxels, and the predicted homogenized
elastic moduli are shown to agree with that obtained from the brute-force DNS.
The transferability of the trained 3D CNN model (using transfer learning) is
further demonstrated by predicting the homogenized elastic moduli of a
limestone rock with calcite mineralogy. The surrogate 3D CNN model in
combination with the HHM is thus shown to be a promising tool for the
homogenization of large 3D digital rock images and other random media

  Inner Loop","29 pages, 4 figures, submitted to journal",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Standard approaches to difference-of-convex (DC) programs require exact
solution to a convex subproblem at each iteration, which generally requires
noiseless computation and infinite iterations of an inner iterative algorithm.
To tackle these difficulties, inexact DC algorithms have been proposed, mostly
by relaxing the convex subproblem to an approximate monotone inclusion problem.
However, there is no guarantee that such relaxation can lead to a finitely
terminating inner loop. In this paper, we point out the termination issue of
existing inexact DC algorithms by presenting concrete counterexamples.
Exploiting the notion of $\epsilon$-subdifferential, we propose a novel inexact
proximal linearized DC algorithm termed tPLDCA. Despite permission to a great
extent of inexactness in computation, tPLDCA enjoys the same convergence
guarantees as exact DC algorithms. Most noticeably, the inner loop of tPLDCA is
guaranteed to terminate in finite iterations as long as the inner iterative
algorithm converges to a solution of the proximal point subproblem, which makes
an essential difference from prior arts. In addition, by assuming the first
convex component of the DC function to be pointwise maximum of finitely many
convex smooth functions, we propose a computational friendly surrogate of
$\epsilon$-subdifferential, whereby we develop a feasible implementation of
tPLDCA. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
implementation of tPLDCA.

the so-called lower-star filtration which utilizes quantitative node

over successive scale values on a one-dimensional grid. Our approach avoids
embedding a graph into a metric space and has stability properties against

motions in the input frames, which makes it difficult to accurately aggregate
information from multiple frames. Existing works either adopt deformable
convolutions or estimate optical flow as a prior to establish correspondences
between frames for the effective alignment and fusion. However, they fail to
take into account the valuable semantic information that can greatly enhance
it; and flow-based methods heavily rely on the accuracy of a flow estimate
model, which may not provide precise flows given two low-resolution frames.
  In this paper, we investigate a more robust and semantic-aware prior for
enhanced VSR by utilizing the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a powerful
foundational model that is less susceptible to image degradation. To use the
SAM-based prior, we propose a simple yet effective module -- SAM-guidEd

plug-in module is specifically designed to not only leverage the attention
mechanism for the generation of semantic-aware feature but also be easily and
seamlessly integrated into existing methods. Concretely, we apply our SEEM to
two representative methods, EDVR and BasicVSR, resulting in consistently
improved performance with minimal implementation effort, on three widely used
VSR datasets: Vimeo-90K, REDS and Vid4. More importantly, we found that the

providing increased flexibility in adjusting the balance between performance

specific lexical choices are unlikely to repeat? This paper presents two dyadic
studies (N = 240) that address this axis of generalization, focusing on the
role of nameability -- the a priori likelihood that two individuals will share
the same label. We leverage the recently-released KiloGram dataset, a
collection of abstract tangram images that is orders of magnitude larger than
previously available, exhibiting high diversity of properties like nameability.
Our first study asks how nameability shapes convention formation, while the
second asks how new conventions generalize to entirely new targets of
reference. Our results raise new questions about how ad hoc conventions extend
beyond target-specific re-use of specific lexical choices.

robustness of VIF models. We apply adversarial attacks to VIF models and find
that the VIF models are very vulnerable to adversarial examples. To improve
attack efficiency, we suggest to make full use of the property of video frame

  Continuous Clustering and Density Cheeger-Buser",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DS math.FA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering algorithms that has
stood the test of time. It is simple to describe, can be implemented using
standard linear algebra, and often finds better clusters than traditional
clustering algorithms like $k$-means and $k$-centers. The foundational
algorithm for two-way spectral clustering, by Shi and Malik, creates a
geometric graph from data and finds a spectral cut of the graph.
  In modern machine learning, many data sets are modeled as a large number of
points drawn from a probability density function. Little is known about when
spectral clustering works in this setting -- and when it doesn't. Past
researchers justified spectral clustering by appealing to the graph Cheeger
inequality (which states that the spectral cut of a graph approximates the
``Normalized Cut''), but this justification is known to break down on large
data sets.
  We provide theoretically-informed intuition about spectral clustering on
large data sets drawn from probability densities, by proving when a continuous
form of spectral clustering considered by past researchers (the unweighted
spectral cut of a probability density) finds good clusters of the underlying
density itself. Our work suggests that Shi-Malik spectral clustering works well
on data drawn from mixtures of Laplace distributions, and works poorly on data
drawn from certain other densities, such as a density we call the `square-root
trough'.
  Our core theorem proves that weighted spectral cuts have low weighted
isoperimetry for all probability densities. Our key tool is a new Cheeger-Buser
inequality for all probability densities, including discontinuous ones.

or opinions but also served as a hotbed of polarization. While much research
attempts to explore different causes of opinion polarization, the effect of
perception bias caused by the network structure itself is largely understudied.
To this end, we propose a threshold model that simulates the evolution of
opinions by taking into account the perception bias, which is the gap between
global information and locally available information from the neighborhood
within networks. Our findings suggest that polarization occurs when the
collective stubbornness of the population exceeds a critical value which is
largely affected by the perception bias. In addition, as the level of
stubbornness grows, the occurrence of first-order and second-order phase
transitions between consensus and polarization becomes more prevalent, and the
types of these phase transitions rely on the initial proportion of active
opinions. Notably, for regular network structures, a step-wise pattern emerges
that corresponds to various levels of polarization and is strongly associated
with the formation of echo chambers. Our research presents a valuable framework
for investigating the connection between perception bias and opinion
polarization and provides valuable insights for mitigating polarization in the
context of biased information.

major challenge for systems with nonlinear dynamics. A general approach in such
cases is to leverage Lyapunov stability theory to compute a combination of a
Lyapunov control function and an associated control policy. However, finding
Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems is a challenging task. To
address this challenge, several methods have been recently proposed that
represent Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, such approaches
have been designed exclusively for continuous-time systems. We propose the
first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in discrete-time systems.
Three key ingredients enable us to effectively learn provably stable control
policies. The first is a novel mixed-integer linear programming approach for
verifying the stability conditions in discrete-time systems. The second is a
novel approach for computing sub-level sets which characterize the region of
attraction. Finally, we rely on a heuristic gradient-based approach for quickly
finding counterexamples to significantly speed up Lyapunov function learning.
Our experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For example, on the path
tracking benchmark, we outperform recent neural Lyapunov control baselines by
an order of magnitude in both running time and the size of the region of

first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.

evidently have birth masses close to $\sim 2.0\;M_\odot$, we explore here the
possibility that BH-UCXBs may form via accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of
accreting NSs, assuming that these previously evolved in LMXBs to masses all
the way up to the maximum limit of a NS. We demonstrate this formation path by
modelling a few cases of NS-UCXBs with initial NS masses close to the maximum
mass of a NS that evolve into BH-UCXBs after the NS accretes material from its
He~WD companion. We follow the evolution of the post-AIC BH-UCXB and, based on
simple arguments, we anticipate that there is about one BH-UCXB with an AIC
origin and a He~WD donor within the current sample of known UCXBs and that 2--5
such BH-UCXBs may be detected in gravitational waves by LISA. In addition, we
find that the X-ray luminosity of NS-UCXBs near their orbital period minimum

complete graph, two-dimensional (2D) square lattice, and one-dimensional (1D)

observe the model on the complete graph undergoes a continuous phase transition
where the critical points are $p_c \approx 0.334$ ($p_c\approx 0.667$) for the
model with independent (anticonformist) agents. On the 2D square lattice, the

scaling analysis, we obtain the same sets of critical exponents for both models

Therefore they are identical to the mean-field Ising model. However, in the
case of the 2D square lattice, the models with independent and anticonformist

lightweight global metric, which is faster than existing methods, to measure
the sensitivity of each component in ViTs to quantization errors. Moreover, we
also introduce a pareto frontier approach to automatically allocate the optimal
bit-precision according to the sensitivity. To further reduce the computational
complexity of self-attention in inference stage, we propose a patch-wise module
to reallocate bit-width of patches in each layer. Extensive experiments on the
ImageNet dataset shows that our method greatly reduces the search cost and
facilitates the application of mixed-precision quantization to ViTs.

2D transonic flows over the RAE2822 airfoils and 3D transonic flows over the

hosting planets with detectable life because of these stars' long lifetimes and
relative planet to star mass and radius ratios. An important aspect of these
stars to consider is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation
incident on planets in the habitable zones due to the ability of UV and X-ray
radiation to alter the chemistry and evolution of planetary atmospheres. In
this work, we build on the results of the HAZMAT I (Shkolnik & Barman 2014) and
HAZMAT III (Schneider & Shkolnik 2018) M star studies to determine the
intrinsic UV and X-ray flux evolution with age for M stars using Gaia
parallactic distances. We then compare these results to the intrinsic fluxes of
K stars adapted from HAZMAT V (Richey-Yowell et al. 2019). We find that
although the intrinsic M star UV flux is 10 to 100 times lower than that of K
stars, the UV fluxes in their respective habitable zone are similar. However,
the habitable zone X-ray flux evolutions are slightly more distinguishable with
a factor of 3 -- 15 times larger X-ray flux for late-M stars than for K stars.
These results suggest that there may not be a K dwarf advantage compared to M
stars in the UV, but one may still exist in the X-ray.

from partially observed traffic data, is an inevitable and challenging task in
data-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Due to traffic data's
multidimensional and spatiotemporal properties, we treat the missing data
imputation as a tensor completion problem. Many studies have been on STDI based
on tensor decomposition in the past decade. However, how to use spatiotemporal
correlations and core tensor sparsity to improve the imputation performance
still needs to be solved. This paper reshapes a 3rd/4th order Hankel tensor and
proposes an innovative manifold regularized Tucker decomposition (ManiRTD)
model for STDI. Expressly, we represent the sensory traffic state data as the
3rd/4th tensors by introducing Multiway Delay Embedding Transforms. Then,
ManiRTD improves the sparsity of the Tucker core using a sparse regularization
term and employs manifold regularization and temporal constraint terms of
factor matrices to characterize the spatiotemporal correlations. Finally, we
address the ManiRTD model through a block coordinate descent framework under
alternating proximal gradient updating rules with convergence-guaranteed.
Numerical experiments are conducted on real-world spatiotemporal traffic

the other factorization approaches and reconstructs the STD more precisely

solving the BTE at the cell interface. Numerical results show that the present
scheme can correctly predict the electron-phonon coupling constant, and is in

computing devices. Secondly, the device type which dominates the communication
overhead is various to different job types. To achieve a better gain-overhead
tradeoff, we formulate an accumulative reward maximization program and design
an online algorithm, i.e., OGASched, to schedule multi-server jobs. The reward
of a job is formulated as the parallel computation gain aggregated over the
allocated computing devices minus the penalty on the dominant communication
overhead. OGASched allocates computing devices to each arrived job in the
ascending direction of the reward gradients. OGASched has a best-so-far regret
with concave rewards, which grows sublinearly with the number of job types and

challenging, which requires large capacity, high imperceptibility, and high
security. Although recent advances in hiding image-level messages have been
remarkable, existing schemes are limited to lossless spatial images as covers
and cannot be directly applied to JPEG images, the ubiquitous lossy format
images in daily life. The difficulties of migration are caused by the lack of
targeted design and the loss of details due to lossy decompression and
re-compression. Considering that taking DCT densely on $8\times8$ image patches
is the core of the JPEG compression standard, we design a novel model called
\textsf{EFDR}, which can comprehensively \underline{E}xploit
\underline{F}ine-grained \underline{D}CT \underline{R}epresentations and embed
the secret image into quantized DCT coefficients to avoid the lossy process.
Specifically, we transform the JPEG cover image and hidden secret image into
fine-grained DCT representations that compact the frequency and are associated
with the inter-block and intra-block correlations. Subsequently, the
fine-grained DCT representations are further enhanced by a sub-band features
enhancement module. Afterward, a transformer-based invertibility module is
designed to fuse enhanced sub-band features. Such a design enables a
fine-grained self-attention on each sub-band and captures long-range
dependencies while maintaining excellent reversibility for hiding and recovery.
To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to embed a color image of
equal size in a color JPEG image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our \textsf{EFDR} with superior performance.

detection performance and are indispensable tools for cutting-edge optical
science and technologies, including photonic quantum computation and quantum
networks. Ultra-wide superconducting strips with widths of tens of micrometers
are desirable to achieve high polarization-independent detection efficiency
using a simple straight strip. However, biasing the ultra-wide strip with
sufficient superconducting current to make it sensitive to infrared photons is
challenging. The main difficulty is maldistribution of the superconducting
current in the strip, which generates excessive intrinsic dark counts. Here, we
present a novel superconducting wide strip photon detector (SWSPD) with a high
critical current bank (HCCB) structure. This HCCB structure enables suppression
of the intrinsic dark counts and sufficient superconducting current biasing of
the wide strip. We have experimentally demonstrated a polarization-independent
system detection efficiency of ~78% for 1550 nm wavelength photons and a system
dark count rate of ~80 cps using a 20-${\mu}$m-wide SWSPD with the HCCB
structure. Additionally, fast jitter of 29.8 ps was achieved. The
photolithographically manufacturable ultra-wide SWSPD with high efficiency, low
dark count, and fast temporal resolution paves the way toward the development
of large-scale optical quantum technologies, which will require enormous

referred to as the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. Motivated by the

utilizing the concept of distance to degeneracy and minimizes a tractable
surrogate of the SPO loss on the collected data. In particular, we develop an
efficient active learning algorithm with both hard and soft rejection variants,
each with theoretical excess risk (i.e., generalization) guarantees. We further
derive bounds on the label complexity, which refers to the number of samples
whose labels are acquired to achieve a desired small level of SPO risk. Under
some natural low-noise conditions, we show that these bounds can be better than
the naive supervised learning approach that labels all samples. Furthermore,
when using the SPO+ loss function, a specialized surrogate of the SPO loss, we
derive a significantly smaller label complexity under separability conditions.

that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in
features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing
delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with
either large quantum circuits or large number of quantum circuits, into smaller
units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's
Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into
multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of
circuits run on one hardware to smaller batches of circuits run on different
hardware. These can improve the utilization of heterogenous quantum hardware,
but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic
classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector
Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on circuit execution times, pre- and
post-processing overhead, and quality of the result relative to a baseline
without parallelization. Results are obtained on real hardware and complemented
by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is ~39\% better in
ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data
parallelization with reduced feature set yields upto 3x improvement in quantum
workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3x, while providing
comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ~7\% and

attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous

state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.
In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the

superquadrics are recovered at different positions within the object,
representing the local geometric features of the object surface. Subsequently,
our algorithm exploits the tri-symmetry feature of superquadrics and
synthesizes a list of antipodal grasps from each recovered superquadric. An
evaluation model is designed to assess and quantify the quality of each grasp
candidate. The grasp candidate with the highest score is then selected as the
final grasping pose. We conduct experiments on isolated and packed scenes to
corroborate the effectiveness of our method. The results indicate that our

omits implementation details (e.g., APIs). Then, TiP implements the sketch into
a program using specific programming languages. We conduct extensive

decentralized storage systems such as Storj and Filebase/Sia, we study the
problem of designing compact repair groups for recovering multiple failures in
a decentralized manner. Here, compactness means that the corresponding trace
repair schemes of these groups of helpers can be generated from a single or a
few seed repair schemes, thus saving the time and space required for finding
and storing them. The goal is to design compact repair groups that can tolerate
as many failures as possible. It turns out that the maximum number of failures
a collection of repair groups can tolerate equals the size of a minimum hitting
set of a collection of subsets of the finite field {\mathbb{F}_{q^{\ell}}}
minus one. When the repair groups for each symbol are generated from a single
subspace, we establish a pair of asymptotically tight lower bound and upper
bound on the size of such a minimum hitting set. Using Burnside's Lemma and the
M\""{o}bius inversion formula, we determine a number of subspaces that together
attain the upper bound on the minimum hitting set size when the repair groups
are generated from multiple subspaces.

govern the short- and long-term motion patterns and the overall dynamics of
landbound, plant-eating animals and ruminants in particular? To answer this
question, we here study the movement dynamics of springbok antelopes Antidorcas
marsupialis. We propose complementary statistical analysis techniques combined
with machine learning approaches to analyze, across multiple time scales, the
springbok motion recorded in long-term GPS-tracking of collared springboks at a
private wildlife reserve in Namibia. As a new result, we are able to predict
the springbok movement within the next hour with a certainty of about 20\%. The
remaining 80\% are stochastic in nature and are induced by unaccounted factors
in the modeling algorithm and by individual behavioral features of springboks.
We find that directedness of motion contributes approximately 17\% to this
predicted fraction. We find that the measure for directedeness is strongly
dependent on the daily cycle. The previously known daily affinity of springboks
to their water points, as predicted from our machine learning algorithm,
overall accounts for only 3\% of this predicted deterministic component of
springbok motion. Moreover, the resting points are found to affect the motion
of springboks at least as much as the formally studied effects of water points.
The generality of these statements for the motion patterns and their underlying
behavioral reasons for other ruminants can be examined on the basis of our
statistical analysis tools.

discrepancies between simulated scenarios and naturalistic driving
environments. To address this, we propose the Matrix-Fuzzer, a behavior
tree-based testing framework, to automatically generate realistic
safety-critical test scenarios. Our approach involves the $log2BT$ method,
which abstracts logged road-users' trajectories to behavior sequences.
Furthermore, we vary the properties of behaviors from real-world driving
distributions and then use an adaptive algorithm to explore the input space.
Meanwhile, we design a general evaluation engine that guides the algorithm
toward critical areas, thus reducing the generation of invalid scenarios. Our
approach is demonstrated in our Matrix Simulator. The experimental results show
that: (1) Our $log2BT$ achieves satisfactory trajectory reconstructions. (2)
Our approach is able to find the most types of safety-critical scenarios, but
only generating around 30% of the total scenarios compared with the baseline
algorithm. Specifically, it improves the ratio of the critical violations to
total scenarios and the ratio of the types to total scenarios by at least 10x

computing efficiency has slowed down. Therefore, drawing inspiration from the
dynamic and adaptive properties of biological systems, research in neural
morphology computing has great potential for development. Memristors, a class
of nonlinear resistors with memory function, naturally embody dynamics through
their internal electrical processes. This enables nonconventional computing
paradigms with enhanced capability and energy efficiency, such as reservoir
computing. In this paper, we propose a volatile memristor made of LiNbO3 with
nonlinear I-V characteristics and short-term memory function. This memristor is
well-suited to be used as a nonlinear node in the storage layer of reservoir
computing. With this system, we can achieve the same functionality as
traditional reservoir computing with a single device, instead of a large number
of interconnected nodes. The collective states of memristors after the
application of trains of pulses to the respective memristors are unique for
each combination of pulse patterns. This provides a more reliable and efficient
way for subsequent output layer classification processing. The system was
successfully used to recognize images of Arabic numerals 0-9. This work not

this paper, we present a novel Point-Voxel Transformer for single-stage 3D

Specifically, we first use voxel-based sparse convolutions for efficient

obtains long-range contexts in a cheap manner from voxels while attaining
accurate positions from points. The key to associating the two different
representations is our introduced input-dependent Query Initialization module,
which could efficiently generate reference points and content queries. Then,
PVT adaptively fuses long-range contextual and local geometric information
around reference points into content queries. Further, to quickly find the
neighboring points of reference points, we design the Virtual Range Image

multi-frame. The experiments on several autonomous driving benchmarks verify
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code will be available

safeguard user privacy by transmitting model parameters instead of raw user
data between user devices and the central server. Nevertheless, the current
federated recommender system faces challenges such as heterogeneity and
personalization, model performance degradation, and communication bottleneck.
Previous studies have attempted to address these issues, but none have been
able to solve them simultaneously.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named PerFedRec++, to enhance
the personalized federated recommendation with self-supervised pre-training.
Specifically, we utilize the privacy-preserving mechanism of federated
recommender systems to generate two augmented graph views, which are used as
contrastive tasks in self-supervised graph learning to pre-train the model.
Pre-training enhances the performance of federated models by improving the
uniformity of representation learning. Also, by providing a better initial
state for federated training, pre-training makes the overall training converge
faster, thus alleviating the heavy communication burden. We then construct a
collaborative graph to learn the client representation through a federated
graph neural network. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users
into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Each
user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the
cluster-level federated model, and its own fine-tuned local model. Experiments
on three real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior
performance over existing methods.

Fast-NMTF in terms of approximation and prediction performance when fitted on

the whole network, triFastSTMF outperforms Fast-NMTF by several orders of

operations, which are less prone to predict large values compared to standard

estimation (MLE) of high dimensional sparse covariance matrices. Unlike most of
the state of-the-art methods, which either use regularization techniques or
penalize the likelihood to impose sparsity, we solve the MLE problem based on
an estimated covariance graph. More specifically, we propose a two-stage
procedure: in the first stage, we determine the sparsity pattern of the target
covariance matrix (in other words the marginal independence in the covariance
graph under a Gaussian graphical model) using the multiple hypothesis testing
method of false discovery rate (FDR), and in the second stage we use either a
block coordinate descent approach to estimate the non-zero values or a proximal
distance approach that penalizes the distance between the estimated covariance
graph and the target covariance matrix. Doing so gives rise to two different
methods, each with its own advantage: the coordinate descent approach does not
require tuning of any hyper-parameters, whereas the proximal distance approach
is computationally fast but requires a careful tuning of the penalty parameter.
Both methods are effective even in cases where the number of observed samples
is less than the dimension of the data. For performance evaluation, we test the
proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data and show that they
provide more accurate estimates of the sparse covariance matrix than two
state-of-the-art methods.

benchmark the performance of the real hardware, the D-Wave 2000Q, against
several state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms designed for
continuous-variable problems to find that the D-Wave 2000Q matches the
classical algorithms in a limited domain of computation time. Beyond this

simulated quantum annealing, and spin-vector Monte Carlo. The data show that
TEBD's coherent quantum annealing achieves far better results than the other
approaches, in particular demonstrating the effectiveness of coherent

The case where the covering surface is also the sphere was solved somewhat

that the only other exceptional candidate data, besides those of Pakovich (five
infinite families and one sporadic case), are a well-known very specific
infinite family in degree 4 (indexed by the genus of the candidate covering
surface, which can attain any value), five sporadic cases (four in genus 1 and

dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, where radar and
communications are performed simultaneously with a common signal. However, with
random communication symbols (CS) in DFRC, the transmit signal has a random
ambiguity function that affects the radar's range-velocity estimation
performance, whose influence is remained uncovered. Hence, this paper focuses
on minimizing the outlier probability (OP) -- the probability of incorrectly
estimating a target's range-velocity bin -- in OFDM DFRC w.r.t the CS
probability distribution (i.e., the \emph{input distribution}). Conditioned on
the CSs, the OP only depends on the CS magnitudes. Hence, we consider the
following two schemes for the above optimization: CSs with (1) constant
magnitude (phase shift keying input), and (2) random magnitude (Gaussian
input). For (1), the problem reduces to the familiar power allocation design
across OFDM's subcarriers and symbols, with uniform power allocation across
subcarriers and a \emph{windowed} power allocation across symbols being
near-optimal. For (2), the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution at
each subcarrier is optimized, with an additional communication constraint to
avoid the zero-variance solution where no CSs are carried. We observe that
subcarriers with strong communication channels feature strong variance (i.e.,
favour communications) while the others are characterized by a strong mean
(favouring radar). However, the overall power allocation (i.e., the sum of mean
and variance) across the OFDM subcarriers and symbols is similar to (1).
Simulations show that CSs with random magnitudes degrade the sensing
performance, but can be compensated significantly with the proposed input
distribution optimization.

range of densities, the ground state of the Skyrme model in the three torus is
shown to correspond to configurations with different symmetries, with a
sequence of phase transitions between such configurations. The effects of
nonzero finite isospin asymmetry are taken into account by the canonical
quantization of isospin collective coordinates, and some thermodynamical and
nuclear observables (such as the symmetry energy) are computed as a function of
the density. We also explore the extension of the model to accommodate strange
degrees of freedom, and find a first order transition for the condensation of
kaons in the Skyrme crystal background in a thermodynamically consistent,
non-perturbative way. Finally, an approximate EOS of dense matter is
constructed by fitting the free parameters of the model to some nuclear
observables close to saturation density, which are particularly relevant for

these situations may be of relevance: in pharmacology, one may be interested in
how outcomes of people living with -- and treated for -- HIV, such as viral
failure, would vary for time-varying interventions such as different drug
concentration trajectories. A challenge for doing causal inference with
continuous interventions is that the positivity assumption is typically
violated. To address positivity violations, we develop projection functions,
which reweigh and redefine the estimand of interest based on functions of the

obtain the desired dose-response curve in areas of enough support, and
otherwise a meaningful estimand that does not require the positivity

Those are contrasted with g-computation estimators which are applied to

partitioning problems are formulated as mixed-integer nonlinear programming
(MINLP) problems with the objective of minimizing task completion delay. We
propose a low-complexity maximum value descent (MVD) algorithm to optimally

deletions, and substitutions of characters needed to transform one string into
the other. The textbook dynamic-programming algorithm computes the edit
distance of two length-$n$ strings in $O(n^2)$ time, which is optimal up to
subpolynomial factors under SETH. An established way of circumventing this
hardness is to consider the bounded setting, where the running time is
parameterized by the edit distance $k$. A celebrated algorithm by Landau and
Vishkin (JCSS '88) achieves time $O(n + k^2)$, which is optimal as a function
of $n$ and $k$.
  Most practical applications rely on a more general weighted edit distance,
where each edit has a weight depending on its type and the involved characters
from the alphabet $\Sigma$. This is formalized through a weight function $w :
\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}\times\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}\to\mathbb{R}$
normalized so that $w(a,a)=0$ and $w(a,b)\geq 1$ for all $a,b \in
\Sigma\cup\{\varepsilon\}$ with $a \neq b$; the goal is to find an alignment of
the two strings minimizing the total weight of edits. The $O(n^2)$-time
algorithm supports this setting seamlessly, but only very recently, Das,
Gilbert, Hajiaghayi, Kociumaka, and Saha (STOC '23) gave the first non-trivial
algorithm for the bounded version, achieving time $O(n + k^5)$. While this
running time is linear for $k\le n^{1/5}$, it is still very far from the bound
$O(n+k^2)$ achievable in the unweighted setting.
  In this paper, we essentially close this gap by showing both an improved
$\tilde O(n+\sqrt{nk^3})$-time algorithm and, more surprisingly, a matching
lower bound: Conditioned on the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) hypothesis, our
running time is optimal for $\sqrt{n}\le k\le n$ (up to subpolynomial factors).
This is the first separation between the complexity of the weighted and
unweighted edit distance problems.

most importantly transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$). TGF-$\beta$
is a critical inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer
cells that leads to increased cell motility and invasion in a Smad dependent

map here for the first time the range of heavy neutrino mixing angle consistent
with both neutrino masses and leptogenesis in a scenario with 3 generations of
right-handed neutrinos with Majorana masses between 50 MeV and 70 TeV. Due to
the presence of a third degree of freedom that remains much more feebly coupled

the target by using 2D and 3D first-principle particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. In our simulations, aluminium target of 2.7 g/cc is simulated in
two different situations by using a newly developed high order implicit PIC

into account significantly underestimate the energy loss of electron beam when
transporting in the target, which fail to describe the complete characteristics
of CTR produced by electron beam on the back surface of the target. Realistic
simulations indicate the diameter of CTR increases when the thickness of the
target is increased. This is attributed to synergetic energy losses of high
flux fast electrons due to Ohm heatings and colliding drags, which appear quite
significant even when the thickness of the solid target only differs by
micrometers. Especially, when the diagnosing position is fixed, we find that
the intensity distribution of the CTR is also a function of time, with the
diameter increased with time. As the diameter of CTR is related to the speed of

limit is determined by a single `dominant' Eigenvalue of an associated quantum
transfer matrix in the infinite Trotter number limit. For integrable quantum
spin chains, related with solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation, an appropriate
choice of the quantum transfer matrix enables to study its spectrum, e.g.\ by
means of the algebraic Bethe Ansatz. In its turn, the knowledge of the full
spectrum allows one to study its universality properties such as the appearance
of a conformal spectrum in the low-temperature regime. More generally,
accessing the full spectrum is a necessary step for deriving thermal form
factor series representations of the correlation functions of local operators
for the spin chain under consideration. These are statements that have been
established by physicists on a heuristic level and that are calling for a
rigorous mathematical justification. In this work we implement certain aspects
of this programme with the example of the XXZ quantum spin chain in the
antiferromagnetic massless regime and in the low-temperature limit. We
rigorously establish the existence and characterise the form of the solutions
to the non-linear integral equations that are equivalent to the Bethe Ansatz
equations for the quantum transfer matrix of this model. This allows us to
describe that part of the quantum transfer matrix spectrum that is related to
the Bethe Ansatz and that does not collapse to zero in the infinite Trotter
number limit. Within the considered part of the spectrum we rigorously identify
the dominant Eigenvalue and show that those correlations lengths that diverge
in the low-temperature limit are given, to the leading order, by the spectrum
of the free Boson $c=1$ conformal field theory. This rigorously establishes a
long-standing conjecture present in the physics literature.

This technique is proposed to be applied in AMS for dating geological objects,
namely for geochronology of Cenozoic era.
  In this work, we developed a new larger version of the TPC with a dedicated
thin silicon nitride window for an efficient passage of ions. The TPC
characteristics were studied in isobutane at low pressures using alpha particle
sources. In addition, the use of GEM instead of THGEM has been shown to
substantially improve the energy resolution at a nominal pressure (50 torr).
Using these results and SRIM code simulations, it is shown that isobaric boron

dating on a scale of ten million years. This technique will be applied in the
AMS facility in Novosibirsk in the near future.

demonstrate an application of this to the Rotating Shallow Water Equations
(RSWEs). To begin, a nonlinear time-stepping `triadic error' metric is
constructed from three-wave interactions. Stability polynomials, obtained from
the oscillatory Dahlquist test equation, enable the computation of triadic
errors for different time-steppers; we compare five classical schemes. We next
provide test cases comparing different time-step sizes within a numerical
model. The first case is of a reforming Gaussian height perturbation. This
contains a nonlinear phase shift that can be missed with a large time-step. The
second set of test cases initialise individual waves to allow specific triads
to form. The presence of a slow transition from linear to nonlinear dynamics
creates a good venue for testing how the slow phase information is replicated
with a large time-step. Three models, including the finite element code Gusto,
and the MetOffice's new LFRic model, are examined in these test cases with

tightly coupled quantum bits that can communicate via quantum-coherent and
classical links. In multi-core architectures, it is crucial to minimize the
amount of communication between cores when executing an algorithm. Therefore,
mapping a quantum circuit onto a modular architecture involves finding an
optimal assignment of logical qubits (qubits in the quantum circuit) to
different cores with the aim to minimize the number of expensive inter-core
operations while adhering to given hardware constraints. In this paper, we
propose for the first time a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)

inter-core communication costs in binary decision variables. To this end, the
quantum circuit is split into slices, and qubit assignment is formulated as a
graph partitioning problem for each circuit slice. The costly inter-core
communication is reduced by penalizing inter-core qubit communications. The
final solution is obtained by minimizing the overall cost across all circuit
slices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a detailed
analysis using a representative set of benchmarks having a high number of
qubits on two different multi-core architectures. Our method showed promising
results and performed exceptionally well with very dense and
highly-parallelized circuits that require on average 0.78 inter-core

presence of a strongly focused light beam, a gold-silica Janus particle becomes
confined at the equilibrium point between optical and thermal forces. By using
circularly polarized light, we can transfer angular momentum to the particle
breaking the symmetry between the two forces and resulting in a tangential
force that drives directed orbital motion. We can simultaneously control the
velocity and direction of rotation of the particle changing the ellipticity of
the incoming light beam, while tuning the radius of the orbit with laser power.
Our experimental results are validated using a geometrical optics model that
considers the optical force, the absorption of optical power, and the resulting
heating of the particle. The demonstrated enhanced flexibility in the control
of microengines opens up new possibilities for their utilization in a wide

the efficacy of the concept via application to microscopic imagery of 30k+
planktic foraminifer shells across 32 species when used together with
independent genetic data samples. Most importantly for practitioners, we show
that visual-genetic alignment can significantly benefit visual-only recognition
of the rarest species. Technically, we pre-train a visual ResNet50 deep
learning model using triplet loss formulations to create an initial embedding
space. We re-structure this space based on genetic anchors embedded via a
Sequence Graph Transform (SGT) and linked to visual data by cross-domain cosine
alignment. We show that an LTR approach improves the state-of-the-art across
all benchmarks and that adding our visual-genetic alignment improves per-class

that visual-genetic alignment can be a highly effective tool for complementing
visual biological data containing rare classes. The concept proposed may serve
as an important future tool for integrating genetics and imageomics towards a

audio signal processing. However, restoration derives less of a benefit from
pretrained models compared to the overwhelming success of pretrained models in

interest in how to improve the performance of pretrained models for restoration
tasks such as speech enhancement (SE). Previous works have shown that the
features extracted by pretrained audio encoders are effective for SE tasks, but
these speech-specific encoder-only models usually require extra decoders to
become compatible with SE tasks, and involve complicated pretraining procedures
or complex data augmentation. Therefore, in pursuit of a universal audio model,
the audio masked autoencoder (MAE) whose backbone is the autoencoder of Vision
Transformers (ViT-AE), is extended from audio classification toward restoration
tasks in this paper. ViT-AE naturally learns mel-to-mel mapping that is
compatible with restoration tasks during pretraining. Among many restoration
tasks, SE is chosen due to its well-established evaluation metrics and test
data. We propose variations of ViT-AE to improve the SE performance, where the
mel-to-mel variations yield high scores for non-intrusive metrics and the
STFT-oriented variation is effective at standard intrusive metrics such as
PESQ. Different variations can be used in accordance with the scenarios.
Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies show that MAE pretraining is
also beneficial to SE tasks and help the ViT-AE to better generalize to
out-of-domain distortions. We further found that large-scale noisy data of
general audio sources, rather than clean speech, is sufficiently effective for
pretraining.

relationships in lagged multi-factor models. Within our framework, the
envisioned pipeline takes as input a set of time series, and creates an
enlarged universe of extracted subsequence time series from each input time
series, via a sliding window approach. This is then followed by an application
of various clustering techniques, (such as k-means++ and spectral clustering),
employing a variety of pairwise similarity measures, including nonlinear ones.
Once the clusters have been extracted, lead-lag estimates across clusters are
robustly aggregated to enhance the identification of the consistent
relationships in the original universe. We establish connections to the
multireference alignment problem for both the homogeneous and heterogeneous
settings. Since multivariate time series are ubiquitous in a wide range of
domains, we demonstrate that our method is not only able to robustly detect
lead-lag relationships in financial markets, but can also yield insightful
results when applied to an environmental data set.

significant role in quantum information processing. By generalizing the
resource theory of coherence from von Neumann measurements to positive
operator-valued measures (POVMs), POVM-based coherence measures have been
proposed with respect to the relative entropy of coherence, the $l_1$ norm of
coherence, the robustness of coherence and the Tsallis relative entropy of
coherence. We derive analytically the lower and upper bounds on these
POVM-based coherence of an arbitrary given superposed pure state in terms of
the POVM-based coherence of the states in superposition. Our results can be
used to estimate range of quantum coherence of superposed states. Detailed
examples are presented to verify our analytical bounds.

principle as well as deterministic evolution. Objective collapse models propose
a dynamical explanation for this phenomenon, by making a stochastic non-unitary
and norm-preserving modification to the Schr\""odinger equation. In the present
article we ask how a quantum system evolves under a {\it deterministic} and
non-unitary but norm-preserving evolution? We show using a simple two-qubit
model that under suitable conditions, quantum linear superposition is broken,
with the system predictably driven to one or the other alternatives. If this
deterministic dynamics is coarse-grained and observed over a lower time
resolution, the outcomes appear random while obeying the Born probability rule.
Our analysis hence throws light on the distinct roles of non-unitarity and of
stochasticity in objective collapse models.

pavement design guides. A good road transportation base can provide security
for the transportation of oil and gas in road transportation. This study
attempts to develop a robust artificial intelligence model to estimate
different asphalt pavements' rutting depth clips, temperature, and load axes as
primary characteristics. The experiment data were obtained from 19 asphalt
pavements with different crude oil sources on a 2.038 km long full-scale field
accelerated pavement test track (RIOHTrack, Road Track Institute) in Tongzhou,
Beijing. In addition, this paper also proposes to build complex networks with
different pavement rutting depths through complex network methods and the
Louvain algorithm for community detection. The most critical structural
elements can be selected from different asphalt pavement rutting data, and
similar structural elements can be found. An extreme learning machine algorithm
with residual correction (RELM) is designed and optimized using an independent
adaptive particle swarm algorithm. The experimental results of the proposed
method are compared with several classical machine learning algorithms, with
predictions of Average Root Mean Squared Error, Average Mean Absolute Error,
and Average Mean Absolute Percentage Error for 19 asphalt pavements reaching
1.742, 1.363, and 1.94\% respectively. The experiments demonstrate that the
RELM algorithm has an advantage over classical machine learning methods in
dealing with non-linear problems in road engineering. Notably, the method
ensures the adaptation of the simulated environment to different levels of
abstraction through the cognitive analysis of the production environment
parameters.

particular, it has been revealed that the addition of a 2D Ti oxide layer
sandwiched between graphene and metal induces a p-doping of graphene and a
consistent shift in the Ti d states. These modifications induced by the
interfacial oxide layer induce a reduction of the probability of charge carrier
recombination and enhance the photocatalytic activity of the heterostructure.
This is indicative of a capital role played by thin oxide films in fine-tuning
the properties of heterostructures based on graphene and pave the way to new

optimisation framework for the optimisation of expensive-to-evaluate black-box
functions, such as physical experiments and computer simulators. Bayesian
optimisation is a cost-efficient optimisation strategy that uses surrogate
modelling via Gaussian processes to represent an objective function and
acquisition functions to guide the selection of candidate points to approximate
the global optimum of the objective function. NUBO itself focuses on
transparency and user experience to make Bayesian optimisation easily
accessible to researchers from all disciplines. Clean and understandable code,
precise references, and thorough documentation ensure transparency, while user
experience is ensured by a modular and flexible design, easy-to-write syntax,
and careful selection of Bayesian optimisation algorithms. NUBO allows users to
tailor Bayesian optimisation to their specific problem by writing the
optimisation loop themselves using the provided building blocks. It supports
sequential single-point, parallel multi-point, and asynchronous optimisation of
bounded, constrained, and/or mixed (discrete and continuous) parameter input
spaces. Only algorithms and methods that are extensively tested and validated
to perform well are included in NUBO. This ensures that the package remains
compact and does not overwhelm the user with an unnecessarily large number of
options. The package is written in Python but does not require expert knowledge
of Python to optimise your simulators and experiments. NUBO is distributed as

  Creator",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classifier-free guidance is an effective sampling technique in diffusion
models that has been widely adopted. The main idea is to extrapolate the model
in the direction of text guidance and away from null-text guidance. In this
paper, we demonstrate that null-text guidance in diffusion models is secretly a
cartoon-style creator, i.e., the generated images can be efficiently
transformed into cartoons by simply perturbing the null-text guidance.
Specifically, we proposed two disturbance methods, i.e., Rollback disturbance
(Back-D) and Image disturbance (Image-D), to construct misalignment between the
noisy images used for predicting null-text guidance and text guidance
(subsequently referred to as \textbf{null-text noisy image} and \textbf{text
noisy image} respectively) in the sampling process. Back-D achieves
cartoonization by altering the noise level of null-text noisy image via
replacing $x_t$ with $x_{t+\Delta t}$. Image-D, alternatively, produces
high-fidelity, diverse cartoons by defining $x_t$ as a clean input image, which
further improves the incorporation of finer image details. Through
comprehensive experiments, we delved into the principle of noise disturbing for
null-text and uncovered that the efficacy of disturbance depends on the
correlation between the null-text noisy image and the source image. Moreover,
our proposed techniques, which can generate cartoon images and cartoonize
specific ones, are training-free and easily integrated as a plug-and-play
component in any classifier-free guided diffusion model. Project page is

nature-inspired neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that is based on ant
colony optimization (ACO). CANTS utilizes a continuous search space to
indirectly-encode a neural architecture search space. Synthetic ant agents
explore CANTS' continuous search space based on the density and distribution of
pheromones, strongly inspired by how ants move in the real world. This
continuous search space allows CANTS to automate the design of artificial
neural networks (ANNs) of any size, removing a key limitation inherent to many
current NAS algorithms that must operate within structures of a size that is
predetermined by the user. This work expands CANTS by adding a fourth dimension
to its search space representing potential neural synaptic weights. Adding this
extra dimension allows CANTS agents to optimize both the architecture as well
as the weights of an ANN without applying backpropagation (BP), which leads to
a significant reduction in the time consumed in the optimization process. The
experiments of this study - using real-world data - demonstrate that the
BP-Free~CANTS algorithm exhibits highly competitive performance compared to
both CANTS and ANTS while requiring significantly less operation time.

a differentiable particle rendering system that integrates particles (i)

understanding, have attracted widespread attention for intelligent vision
systems. However, early efforts always consider boosting a single task
unilaterally and neglecting others, seldom investigating their underlying
connections for joint promotion. To overcome these limitations, we establish
the hierarchical dual tasks-driven deep model to bridge these tasks.
Concretely, we firstly construct an image fusion module to fuse complementary
characteristics and cascade dual task-related modules, including a
discriminator for visual effects and a semantic network for feature
measurement. We provide a bi-level perspective to formulate image fusion and
follow-up downstream tasks. To incorporate distinct task-related responses for
image fusion, we consider image fusion as a primary goal and dual modules as
learnable constraints. Furthermore, we develop an efficient first-order
approximation to compute corresponding gradients and present dynamic weighted
aggregation to balance the gradients for fusion learning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our method, which not only produces visually
pleasant fused results but also realizes significant promotion for detection
and segmentation than the state-of-the-art approaches.

ordering dynamics of the one-dimensional random field Ising model (RFIM).
Unlike the usual RFIM, a spin interacts with all other spins through a
ferromagnetic coupling that decays as $r^{-(1+\sigma)}$, where $r$ is the
distance between two spins. In the absence of LR interactions, the size of
coarsening domains $R(t)$ exhibits a crossover from pure system behavior $R(t)
\sim t^{1/2}$ to an asymptotic regime characterized by logarithmic growth:
$R(t) \sim (\ln t)^2$. The LR interactions affect the pre-asymptotic regime,
which now exhibits ballistic growth $R(t) \sim t$, followed by
$\sigma$-dependent growth $R(t) \sim t^{1/(1+\sigma)}$. Additionally, the LR
interactions also affect the asymptotic logarithmic growth, which becomes $R(t)
\sim (\ln t)^{\alpha(\sigma)}$ with $\alpha(\sigma) < 2$. Thus, LR interactions
lead to faster growth than for the nearest-neighbor system at short times.
Unexpectedly, this driving force causes a slowing-down of the dynamics ($\alpha
< 2$) in the asymptotic logarithmic regime. This is explained in terms of a
non-trivial competition between the pinning force caused by the random field
and the driving force introduced by LR interactions. We also study the spatial
correlation function and the autocorrelation function of the magnetization
field. The former exhibits superuniversality for all $\sigma$, i.e., a scaling
function that is independent of the disorder strength. The same holds for the
autocorrelation function when $\sigma<1$, whereas clear violation of
superuniversality is seen for $\sigma>1$.

taken to be theoretical variables, physical variables that may be accessible or
inaccessible, i.e., it may be possible or impossible for an actor to assign
arbitrarily sharp numerical values to them. In an epistemic process, the
accessible variables are just ideal observations connected to an actor or to
some communicating actors. Group actions are defined on these variables, and
group representation theory is the basis for developing the Hilbert space
formalism. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables are
derived, and in the discrete case it is argued that the possible physical
values are the eigenvalues of these operators. The interpretation of quantum
states (or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions
to nature together with sharp answers to those questions. The questions may be
complementary in the sense defined by Bohr. The focus of the paper are some
mathematical theorems associated with the proposed foundation of quantum
theory. It is shown here that the groups and transformation needed in this
approach can be constructed explicitly in the case where the accessible
variables are finite-dimensional. This simplifies the theory considerably. It
is my view that the discussion on the interpretation of quantum mechanics
should come after a thorough treatment of the foundation issue. The
interpretation proposed here may be called a general epistemic interpretation
of quantum theory. It is similar in some respects to QBism, can also be seen as
a concrete implementation of aspects of Rovelli's Relational Quantum Mechanics,
and has a relationship to several other interpretations.

the most energetic persistent particle accelerators in the Universe, studies
suggest that they could account for up to for 10-30% of the neutrino flux
measured by IceCube. Our recent results highlighted that the associated IceCube
neutrinos arrived in a local gamma-ray minimum (dip) of three strong neutrino
point-source candidates. We increase the sample of neutrino-source candidates

We apply the Bayesian block algorithm on the light curves to characterize their
variability. Our results indicate that GB6 J1040+0617 was in the phase of high
gamma-ray activity, while none of the other 7 neutrino source candidates were
statistically bright during the detection of the corresponding neutrinos and
that indeed even most of the times neutrinos arrived in a faint gamma-ray phase
of the light curves. This suggests that the 8 source-candidate blazars
(associated with 7 neutrino events) in our reduced sample are either not the
sources of the corresponding IceCube neutrinos, or that an in-source effect

Theory (EFT) for the system, which is appropriate for discussing universal
phenomena. The EFT is constructed as a direct product of two known
one-dimensional ones obtained both from the thermodynamic limit of the
Calogero-Sutherland model. This lower dimensional EFT is known to be capable of
describing a quantum hydrodynamical flow. The resulting two-dimensional EFT
displays a ground state charge density that is constant along the large

potential and two PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ for a point-like source
in the case of a non-vanishing scalar potential, respectively. These PPN
parameters are theory-dependent constants in the first case and
distance-dependent in the second case. For a strong coupling scalar field with
or without mass, or at the large distances limit, the PPN parameters $\gamma$
and $\beta$ tend to one. Our calculations can reduce to the previous results in
simpler cases, including massless/massive Brans-Dicke theory.

an extensive comparison of the clustering algorithms K-means clustering,
OPTICS, and Gaussian mixture model clustering (GMM) applied to statistical
features extracted from the time and frequency domains of vibration data sets.
Furthermore, we investigate the influence of feature combinations, feature
selection using principal component analysis (PCA), and the specified number of
clusters on the performance of the clustering algorithms. We conducted this
comparison in terms of a grid search using three different benchmark data sets.
Our work showed that averaging (Mean, Median) and variance-based features
(Standard Deviation, Interquartile Range) performed significantly better than
shape-based features (Skewness, Kurtosis). In addition, K-means outperformed
GMM slightly for these data sets, whereas OPTICS performed significantly worse.
We were also able to show that feature combinations as well as PCA feature
selection did not result in any significant performance improvements. With an
increase in the specified number of clusters, clustering algorithms performed
better, although there were some specific algorithmic restrictions.

discover the concepts the model leverages to make predictions and by exploiting
a Sensitivity Analysis to estimate accurately the importance of each of these

10 and 60 GHz that is not yet fully understood. It seems to be ubiquituous in
our Galaxy and is observed at a broad range of angular scales. Here we use the
new QUIJOTE-MFI wide survey data at 11, 13, 17 and 19 GHz to constrain the AME
in the Galactic plane ($|b|<10^\circ$) on degree scales. We built the spectral
energy distribution between 0.408 and 3000 GHz for each of the 5309
0.9$^\circ$, pixels in the Galactic plane, and fitted a parametric model by
considering five emission components: synchrotron, free-free, AME, thermal dust
and CMB anisotropies. We show that not including QUIJOTE-MFI data points leads
to the underestimation (up to 50 %) of the AME signal in favour of free-free
emission. The parameters describing these components are then intercompared,
looking for relations that help to understand AME physical processes. We find
median values for the AME width, $W_{\rm AME}$, and for its peak frequency,
$\nu_{\rm AME}$, respectively of $0.560^{+0.059}_{-0.050}$ and
$20.7^{+2.0}_{-1.9}$ GHz, slightly in tension with current theoretical models.
We find spatial variations throughout the Galactic plane for $\nu_{\rm AME}$,
but only with reduced statistical significance. We report correlations of AME
parameters with certain ISM properties, such as that between the AME emissivity
(which shows variations with the Galactic longitude) and the interstellar
radiation field, and that between the AME peak frequency and dust temperature.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our results on the possible molecules

detectable in large scale surveys of variable cosmological sources, such as

back pain risk for workers performing demanding activities. However, for the
assistance of tasks differing from lifting, back-support exoskeletons potential
has not been exploited extensively. This work focuses on the use of an active
back-support exoskeleton to assist carrying. Two control strategies are
designed that modulate the exoskeleton torques to comply with the task
assistance requirements. In particular, two gait phase detection frameworks are
exploited to adapt the assistance according to the legs' motion. The two
strategies are assessed through an experimental analysis on ten subjects.
Carrying task is performed without and with the exoskeleton assistance. Results
prove the potential of the presented controls in assisting the task without
hindering the gait movement and improving the usability experienced by users.
Moreover, the exoskeleton assistance significantly reduces the lumbar load
associated with the task, demonstrating its promising use for risk mitigation

goal is to have a better understanding of the computer vision research
conducted in Africa and provide pointers on whether there is equity in research

publications that are Scopus indexed. We first study the opportunities
available for African institutions to publish in top-tier computer vision
venues. We show that African publishing trends in top-tier venues over the
years do not exhibit consistent growth. We also devise a novel way to retrieve
African authors through their affiliation history to have a better

computer vision publications beyond top-tier venues in different African
regions to find that mainly Northern and Southern Africa are publishing in
computer vision with more than 85% of African publications. Finally, we present
the most recurring keywords in computer vision publications. In summary, our
analysis reveals that African researchers are key contributors to African

them on 6 perilla and 6 tomato plants, and selected 2 visible leaves and 4
regions of interest (ROIs) for each plant to assess the biomass and the
chlorophyll content. For NBV planning, the average execution time for single
perilla and tomato plant at a joint speed of 1.55 rad/s was 58.70 s and 53.60 s

~0.37"" on Neptune's 2.24"" disk. After subtracting the planet solid rotation, we
inferred the contribution of zonal winds to the measured Doppler lineshifts at

constrain the latitudinal distribution of wind speeds. We find that CO(3-2) and
HCN(4-3) lines probe the stratosphere of Neptune at pressures of
$2^{+12}_{-1.8}$ mbar and $0.4^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ mbar, respectively. The zonal
winds at these altitudes are less intense than the tropospheric winds based on
cloud tracking from Voyager observations. We find equatorial retrograde
(westward) winds of $-180^{+70}_{-60}$ m/s for CO, and $-190^{+90}_{-70}$ m/s
for HCN. Wind intensity decreases towards mid-latitudes, and wind speeds at
40$^\circ$S are $-90^{+50}_{-60}$ m/s for CO, and $-40^{+60}_{-80}$ m/s for
HCN. Wind speeds become 0 m/s at about 50$^\circ$S, and we find that the
circulation reverses to a prograde jet southwards of 60$^\circ$S. Overall, our
direct stratospheric wind measurements match previous estimates from stellar
occultation profiles and expectations based on thermal wind equilibrium. These
are the first direct Doppler wind measurements performed on the Icy Giants,

observational phenomenon is central to associated calculations of sensitivity,
yield, completeness and occurrence rate. Within the field of exoplanets, the
SNR of a transit has been widely assumed to be the formula that one would
obtain by assuming a boxcar light curve, yielding an SNR of the form
$(\delta/\sigma_0) \sqrt{D}$. In this work, a general framework is outlined for
calculating the SNR of any analytic function and it is applied to the specific
case of a trapezoidal transit as a demonstration. By refining the approximation
from boxcar to trapezoid, an improved SNR equation is obtained that takes the
form $(\delta/\sigma_0) \sqrt{(T_{14}+2T_{23})/3}$. A solution is also derived
for the case of a trapezoid convolved with a top-hat, corresponding to

monotonically decreasing function of integration time. As a rule of thumb,
integration times exceeding $T_{14}/3$ lead to a 10% loss in SNR. This work

  Hybrid Estimator","19 pages, 15 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The kinematic and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ and tSZ) effects probe the
abundance and thermodynamics of ionized gas in galaxies and clusters. We
present a new hybrid estimator to measure the kSZ effect by combining cosmic
microwave background temperature anisotropy maps with photometric and
spectroscopic optical survey data. The method interpolates a velocity
reconstruction from a spectroscopic catalog at the positions of objects in a
photometric catalog, which makes it possible to leverage the high number
density of the photometric catalog and the precision of the spectroscopic
survey. Combining this hybrid kSZ estimator with a measurement of the tSZ
effect simultaneously constrains the density and temperature of free electrons
in the photometrically selected galaxies. Using the 1000 deg2 of overlap
between the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 5, the first three
years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), and the Baryon Oscillation
Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12, we detect the kSZ signal at
4.8${\sigma}$ and reject the null (no-kSZ) hypothesis at 5.1${\sigma}$. This
corresponds to 2.0${\sigma}$ per 100,000 photometric objects with a velocity
field based on a spectroscopic survey with 1/5th the density of the photometric
catalog. For comparison, a recent ACT analysis using exclusively spectroscopic
data from BOSS measured the kSZ signal at 2.1${\sigma}$ per 100,000 objects.
Our derived constraints on the thermodynamic properties of the galaxy halos are
consistent with previous measurements. With future surveys, such as the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of
Space and Time, we expect that this hybrid estimator could result in
measurements with significantly better signal-to-noise than those that rely on
spectroscopic data alone.

learn an unknown state of the world by observing private state-related signals
as well as other agents' actions. In their classic work, Bikhchandani,
Hirshleifer and Welch showed that information cascades occur in social
learning, in which agents blindly follow others' behavior, and consequently,
the actions in a cascade reveal no further information about the state.
  In this paper, we consider the introduction of an information coordinator to
mitigate information cascades. The coordinator commits to a mechanism, which is
a contract that agents may choose to accept or not. If an agent enters the
mechanism, she pays a fee, and sends a message to the coordinator indicating
her private signal (not necessarily truthfully). The coordinator, in turn,
suggests an action to the agents according to his knowledge and interest. We
study a class of mechanisms that possess properties such as individual
rationality for agents (i.e., agents are willing to enter), truth telling, and
profit maximization for the coordinator. We prove that the coordinator, without
loss of optimality, can adopt a summary-based mechanism that depends on the
complete observation history through an appropriate sufficient statistic.
Furthermore, we show the existence of a mechanism which strictly improves
social welfare, and results in strictly positive profit, so that such a
mechanism is acceptable for both agents and the coordinator, and is beneficial
to the agent community. Finally, we analyze the performance of this mechanism
and show significant gains on both aforementioned metrics.

Mainstream
methods mainly rely on point clouds to achieve geometry matching between target

Multi-modal Multi-level Fusion Tracker (MMF-Track), which exploits the image

Specifically, we first propose a Space Alignment Module (SAM) to align RGB

constructing inter-modal associations. Then, in feature interaction level, we
design a Feature Interaction Module (FIM) based on dual-stream structure, which
enhances intra-modal features in parallel and constructs inter-modal semantic

liberated from a substrate are a paradigm for materials at criticality because
flexural phonons can fluctuate into the third dimension. Although studies of
static critical behaviors (e.g., the scale-dependent elastic constants) are
plentiful, investigations of dynamics remain limited. Here, we use molecular
dynamics to study the time dependence of the midpoint (the height
center-of-mass) of doubly clamped nanoribbons, as prototypical graphene
resonators, under a wide range of temperature and strain conditions. By
treating the ribbon midpoint as a Brownian particle confined to a nonlinear
potential (which assumes a double-well shape beyond the buckling transition),
we formulate an effective theory describing the ribbon's tunneling rate across
the two wells and its oscillations inside a given well. We find that, for
nanoribbbons compressed above the Euler buckling point and thermalized above a
temperature at which the non-linear effects due to thermal fluctuations become
significant, the exponential term (the ratio between energy barrier and
temperature) depends only on the geometry, but not the temperature, unlike the
usual Arrhenius behavior. Moreover, we find that the natural oscillation time
for small strain shows a non-trivial scaling $\tau_{\rm o}\sim
L_0^{\,z}T^{-\eta/4}$, with $L_0$ being the ribbon length, $z=2-\eta/2$ being
the dynamic critical exponent, $\eta=0.8$ being the scaling exponent describing

while the $M_{\rm h}$-$M_{\rm AM}$ and $M_{\rm h}$-$\sigma_{\rm s}$ relations
are independent of it. Moreover, the dependence on star formation rate(SFR) is
rather weak in the $M_{\rm h}$-$\sigma_*$ and $M_{\rm h}$-$\sigma_{\rm s}$
relations, but very prominent in the other two. $\sigma_{\rm s}$ is thus the
best proxy among them, and its scaling relation is in good agreement with
hydro-dynamical simulations. However, estimating $\sigma_{\rm s}$ accurately
for individual groups/clusters is challenging because of interlopers and the
requirement for sufficient satellites. We construct new proxies by combining
$M_*$, $\sigma_*$, and $M_{\rm AM}$, and find the proxy with 30\% contribution
from $M_{\rm AM}$ and 70\% from $\sigma_*$ can minimize the dependence on
$N_{\rm sat}$ and SFR. We obtain the $M_{\rm h}$-supermassive black hole(SMBH)

to generate elementary entanglement with its clients followed by entanglement
swapping to distribute end-to-end entanglement of sufficiently high fidelity

quality-of-service requirement specified by the clients as dictated by the
application they run on the network. We consider a discrete-time model for a
quantum switch that attempts generation of fresh elementary entanglement with
clients in each time step in the form of maximally entangled qubit pairs, or
Bell pairs, which succeed probabilistically; the successfully generated Bell
pairs are stored in noisy quantum memories until they can be swapped. We focus
on establishing the value of entanglement distillation of the stored Bell pairs
prior to entanglement swapping in presence of their inevitable aging, i.e.,
decoherence: For a simple instance of a switch with two clients, exponential
decay of entanglement fidelity, and a well-known probabilistic but heralded
two-to-one distillation protocol, given a threshold end-to-end entanglement
fidelity, we use the Markov Decision Processes framework to identify the
optimal action policy - to wait, to distill, or to swap that maximizes
throughput. We compare the switch's performance under the optimal
distillation-enabled policy with that excluding distillation. Simulations of
the two policies demonstrate the improvements that are possible in principle
via optimal use of distillation with respect to average throughput, average
fidelity, and jitter of end-to-end entanglement, as functions of fidelity
threshold. Our model thus helps capture the role of entanglement distillation
in mitigating the effects of decoherence in a quantum switch in an entanglement

determine their attractiveness for data transmission, ranging from
quality-of-service metrics such as jitter to security properties such as the
presence of DDoS defense systems. ISPs improve these attributes in line with
their profit objective, i.e., up to the level that maximizes revenue from
attracted traffic while minimizing attribute-related cost, all in the context
of alternative offers by competing ISPs. In today's Internet, this quality
competition mostly takes place between ISPs that are next-hop options for a
given destination. In contrast, emerging path-aware networks enable end-points
to select entire inter-domain forwarding paths, and thus intensify ISP
competition.
  In this paper, we analyze how path-aware networking changes the competition
dynamics in the Internet, and how path quality and ISP profits are affected as
a result. To that end, we develop a game-theoretic model in which ISPs (i)
affect path quality via multiple attributes that entail costs, (ii) constitute
paths together with other selfish ISPs, and (iii) are in competition with
alternative paths when attracting traffic. The model enables an extensive
theoretical analysis, surprisingly showing that end-point path selection can
have both positive and negative effects on path quality and ISP profits,
depending on the network topology and the cost structure of ISPs. However, a
large-scale simulation, which draws on real-world data to set model parameters,

(non-monotone) Boolean circuits:
  - For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ that
requires monotone circuits of depth $\Omega(\log^k n)$. This significantly
extends a classical result of Okol'nishnikova (1982) and Ajtai and Gurevich
(1987). In addition, our separation holds for a monotone graph property, which
was unknown even in the context of ${\sf AC^0}$ versus ${\sf mAC^0}$.
  - For every $k \geq 1$, there is a monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}[\oplus]$
that requires monotone circuits of size $\exp(\Omega(\log^k n))$. This makes
progress towards a question posed by Grigni and Sipser (1992).
  These results show that constant-depth circuits can be more efficient than
monotone circuits when computing monotone functions.
  In the opposite direction, we observe that non-trivial simulations are
possible in the absence of parity gates: every monotone function computed by an
${\sf AC^0}$ circuit of size $s$ and depth $d$ can be computed by a monotone
circuit of size $2^{n - n/O(\log s)^{d-1}}$. We show that the existence of
significantly faster monotone simulations would lead to breakthrough circuit
lower bounds. In particular, if every monotone function in ${\sf AC^0}$ admits
a polynomial size monotone circuit, then ${\sf NC^2}$ is not contained in ${\sf
NC^1}$ .
  Finally, we revisit our separation result against monotone circuit size and
investigate the limits of our approach, which is based on a monotone lower
bound for constraint satisfaction problems established by G\""o\""os et al.

circuit complexity of Boolean-valued CSPs via their polymorphisms. This result

the object to be reconstructed (the heart) is continuously changing during

with an implicit neural network and fit the network so that the representation
of the heart is consistent with the measurements. The network in the form of a
multi-layer perceptron with Fourier-feature inputs acts as an effective signal
prior and enables adjusting the regularization strength in both the spatial and
temporal dimensions of the signal. We examine the proposed approach for 2D
free-breathing cardiac real-time MRI in different operating regimes, i.e., for
different image resolutions, slice thicknesses, and acquisition lengths. Our
method achieves reconstruction quality on par with or slightly better than
state-of-the-art untrained convolutional neural networks and superior image
quality compared to a recent method that fits an implicit representation
directly to Fourier-domain measurements. However, this comes at a higher
computational cost. Our approach does not require any additional patient data

of coupled excitable units, namely the self-induced stochastic resonance
chimera or SISR-chimera that originates from the SISR phenomenon. We explore
the detailed dynamics of the SISR-chimera in the parameter space using proper
quantitative measures. We have found that unlike CR chimera, the SISR-chimera
pattern strongly depends upon the ratio of time scale and noise intensity.
Therefore, this type of chimera pattern can be induced even for a tiny noise
intensity if the time scale separation of the activator and inhibitor is large

an additional threshold condition determined by the parameter of vector light.
For SRSS at 90 degrees, where the scattered electromagnetic wave travels
perpendicular to the density profile, the polarization variation of the pump
will change the wave vector of scattered light, thereby reducing the growth
length and preventing the scattered electromagnetic wave from growing. This
suppressive scheme is verified through three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations. Our illustrative simulation results demonstrate that for linearly
polarized Gaussian light, the SRSS signal occurs in the 90-degree direction
fiercely. At the same time, for the vector light, there is few SRSS signal even

appearance of double layer thin shells. Double layers arise typically in
theories with dipoles, i.e., two opposite charges, such as electromagnetic
theories, and appear exceptionally in gravitational theories, which are
theories with a single charge. We explore this property of the existence of
double layers in quadratic gravity to find and study traversable wormholes in
which the two domains of the wormhole interior region, where the throat is
located, are matched to two vacuum domains of the exterior region via the use
of two double layer thin shells. The quadratic gravity we use is essentially
given by a $R+\alpha R^2$ Lagrangian, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar of the
spacetime and $\alpha$ is a coupling constant, plus a matter Lagrangian. The
null energy condition, or NEC for short, is tested for the whole wormhole
spacetime. The analysis shows that the NEC is satisfied for the stress-energy
tensor of the matter in the whole wormhole interior region, notably at the
throat, and is satisfied for some of the stress-energy tensor components of the
matter at the double layer thin shell, but is not satisfied for some other
components, namely, the double layer stress-energy distribution component, at
the thin shell. This seems to mean that the NEC is basically impossible, or at
least very hard, to be satisfied when double layer thin shells are present.
Single layer thin shells are also admitted within the theory, and we present
thin shell traversable wormholes, i.e., wormholes without interior, with a
single layer thin shell at the throat for which the corresponding stress-energy
tensor satisfies the NEC, that are asymmetric, i.e., with two different vacuum
domains of the exterior region joined at the wormhole throat.

characterize the estimation performance by deriving the posterior Cram\'er-Rao

bound of it to approximate the estimation performance. Based on this, we
analytically show that by exploiting the prior distribution information, the
PCRB is always no larger than the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) averaged over random

Euclidean path integral in a stationary phase approximation, is determined not
by the on-shell value of the action (which vanishes), but by the
Gibbons--Hawking--York boundary term evaluated on a suitable hypersurface,
which can be chosen arbitrarily far away from the horizon. For this reason, the
black hole singularity seemingly has no influence on the Bekenstein--Hawking
area law. In this Essay we estimate how a regular black hole core, deep inside
a Euclidean black hole of mass $M$ and generated via a UV regulator length
scale $\ell > 0$, affects the black hole entropy. The contributions are
suppressed by factors of $\ell/(2GM)$; demanding exact agreement with the area
law as well as a self-consistent first law of black hole thermodynamics at all
orders, however, demands that these contributions vanish identically via
uniformly bounded curvature. This links the limiting curvature hypothesis to
black hole thermodynamics.

can approach each other but not coalesce. To investigate the coalescence
conditions, we conduct smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations following
the evolution of equal-mass binaries with different initial separations. Since
Population (Pop) I and III protostars have similar interior structures, we
adopt a specific Pop~III model with the mass and radius of $7.75\;M_{\odot}$
and $61.1\;R_{\odot}$ obtained by the stellar evolution calculations. Our
results show that the binary separation decreases due to the transport of the
orbital angular momentum to spin angular momentum. If the initial separation is
less than about 80 per~cent of the sum of the protostellar radius, the binary
coalesces in a time shorter than the tidal lock timescale. The mass loss up to
the merging is $\lesssim 3$ per~cent. After coalescence, the star rotates
rapidly, and its interior structure is independent of the initial separation.
We conclude that there must be some orbital shrinking mechanism after the
protostars contract to enter the zero-age main-sequence stage.

We experimentally demonstrate this protocol in a photonic quantum system, and

rules using traditional join plans, which often leads to redundancy and

redundancy in query answering. However, it is unclear how this can be applied
to materialisation and incremental reasoning with recursive Datalog programs.
Moreover, hypertree decompositions require additional data structures and thus
introduce nonnegligible overhead in both runtime and memory consumption. In
this paper, we provide algorithms that exploit hypertree decompositions for the
materialisation and incremental evaluation of Datalog programs. Furthermore, we
combine this approach with standard Datalog reasoning algorithms in a modular
fashion so that the overhead caused by the decompositions is reduced. Our
empirical evaluation shows that, when the program contains complex rules, the
combined approach is usually significantly faster than the baseline approach,

their location due to small- and large-scale fading, a non-uniform memory
allocation process is used to avoid excessive delivery time in the bottleneck
areas. Then, a well-defined location-aware placement and delivery array (LAPDA)
is used for data delivery to utilize unicast transmission with a fast
converging, iterative linear beamforming process. An underlying weighted
max-min transmit precoder design enables the proposed scheme to serve users in
poor connectivity areas with smaller amounts of data while simultaneously
delivering larger amounts to other users. Unlike previous studies in the
literature, our new scheme is not constrained by the number of users or network
parameters (users' cache capacity, number of antennas at the transmitter, etc.)

Despite non-uniform cache placement, the proposed scheme achieves a coded
caching gain that is additive to the multiplexing gain and outperforms
conventional symmetric CC schemes with only a moderate degree of freedom (DoF)

data or aligning two LiDAR point clouds, can be posed and solved as
least-squares problems. Unfortunately, vanilla nonminimal solvers for
least-squares problems are notoriously sensitive to outliers. As such, various
robust loss functions have been proposed to reduce the sensitivity to outliers.
Examples of loss functions include pseudo-Huber, Cauchy, and Geman-McClure.
Recently, these loss functions have been generalized into a single loss
function that enables the best loss function to be found adaptively based on
the distribution of the residuals. However, even with the generalized robust
loss function, most nonminimal solvers can only be solved locally given a prior
state estimate due to the nonconvexity of the problem. The first contribution
of this paper is to combine graduated nonconvexity (GNC) with the generalized
robust loss function to solve least-squares problems without a prior state
estimate and without the need to specify a loss function. Moreover, existing
loss functions, including the generalized loss function, are based on
Gaussian-like distribution. However, residuals are often defined as the squared
norm of a multivariate error and distributed in a Chi-like fashion. The second
contribution of this paper is to apply a norm-aware adaptive robust loss
function within a GNC framework. This leads to additional robustness when
compared with state-of-the-art methods. Simulations and experiments demonstrate
that the proposed approach is more robust and yields faster convergence times

two-component model with a single magnetic region and a free magnetic field
strength. The second model contains multiple magnetic components with fixed
magnetic field strengths.
  We find average magnetic field strengths ranging from $\sim 0.4$ kG down to

few PEC devices have been developed and investigated for this purpose. We have
developed a series of photoelectrodeposition procedures to deposit mixed-metal
electrocatalyst nanostructures directly on the semiconductor surface for
light-assisted dinitrogen activation. These electrocatalyst compositions
containing Co, Mo and Ru in different atomic ratios follow previously made
recommendations of metal compositions for dinitrogen reduction and exhibit
different physical properties. XPS studies of the photoelectrode surfaces
reveal that our electrocatalyst films are to a large degree nitrogen-free after
their fabrication, which is generally difficult to achieve with traditional
magnetron sputtering or e-beam evaporation techniques. Initial
chronoamperometric measurements of the p-InP photoelectrode coated with the
Co-Mo alloy electrocatalyst show higher photocurrent densities in the presence
of N2(g) than in the presence of Ar at -0.09 V vs RHE. Indications of
successful dinitrogen activation have also been found in consecutive XPS

CMEs and solar wind structures to undergo rotation and deflection during their

and heliosphere can play a significant role in altering its geoeffectiveness
predicted at the time of its eruption. We consider a case study of two
successive CMEs launched from the active region NOAA 12158 in early September
2014. The second CME was predicted to be extensively geoeffective based on the
remote-sensing observations of the source region. However, in situ measurements
at 1~au recorded only a short-lasting weak negative Bz component followed by a
prolonged positive Bz component. The EUropean Heliosphere FORecasting
Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is used to perform a self-consistent 3D MHD
simulation of the two CMEs in the heliosphere. The initial conditions of the
CMEs are determined by combining observational insights near the Sun,
fine-tuned to match the in situ observations near 1~au, and additional
numerical experiments of each individual CME. By introducing CME1 before CME2
in the EUHFORIA simulation, we modelled the negative Bz component in the sheath
region ahead of CME2 whose formation can be attributed to the interaction
between CME1 and CME2. To reproduce the positive Bz component in the magnetic
ejecta of CME2, we had to initialise CME2 with an orientation determined at
0.1~au and consistent with the orientation interpreted at 1~au, instead of the
orientation observed during its eruption. EUHFORIA simulations suggest the
possibility of a significant rotation of CME2 in the low corona in order to
explain the in situ observations at 1~au. Coherent magnetic field rotations,
potentially geoeffective, can be formed in the sheath region as a result of
CME-CME interactions in the heliosphere even if the individual CMEs are not
geoeffective.

However, for non-covalent systems the adiabatic kernel introduces significant

The achievability proof is based on a quantize-and-binning scheme. It is shown

to rural areas, or refraining from commuting to work. The gap in the behavioral

contain samples from $P_{X,Y}$ and $P_{Y,Z}$, respectively. We argue that
causal discovery can help inferring properties of the `unobserved joint
distributions' $P_{X,Y,Z}$ or $P_{X,Z}$. The properties may be conditional
independences (as in `integrative causal inference') or also quantitative
statements about dependences.
  More generally, we define a learning scenario where the input is a subset of
variables and the label is some statistical property of that subset. Sets of
jointly observed variables define the training points, while unobserved sets
are possible test points. To solve this learning task, we infer, as an
intermediate step, a causal model from the observations that then entails
properties of unobserved sets. Accordingly, we can define the VC dimension of a
class of causal models and derive generalization bounds for the predictions.
  Here, causal discovery becomes more modest and better accessible to empirical
tests than usual: rather than trying to find a causal hypothesis that is `true'
a causal hypothesis is {\it useful} whenever it correctly predicts statistical
properties of unobserved joint distributions. This way, a sparse causal graph
that omits weak influences may be more useful than a dense one (despite being
less accurate) because it is able to reconstruct the full joint distribution
from marginal distributions of smaller subsets.
  Within such a `pragmatic' application of causal discovery, some popular
heuristic approaches become justified in retrospect. It is, for instance,
allowed to infer DAGs from partial correlations instead of conditional
independences if the DAGs are only used to predict partial correlations.

dependent electronic structure of PtSe$_2$ allows the control of the THz
emission by SCC. Indeed, we demonstrate the transition from the inverse
Rashba-Edelstein effect in one monolayer to the inverse spin Hall effect in
multilayers. This band structure flexibility makes PtSe$_2$ an ideal candidate

random walking on it. This representation preserves as much information about
the higher-interacting network as possible. The results indicate that the
proposed method effectively addresses the localization problem of certain
classical centralities. In contrast to random walks along pairwise interactions
only, performing more walks along higher-order interactions assists in not only
identifying the most important nodes but also distinguishing nodes that ranked
in the middle and bottom. Our method outperforms classical centralities in
identifying vital nodes and can scale to various tasks in networks, including
information spread maximization and network dismantling problems. The proposed

and lead to a more robust engineered solution and a safer development process.
However, the use of simulators is predicated on the availability of good
models. This contribution is concerned with improving the quality of these
models via calibration, which is cast herein in a Bayesian framework. First, we
discuss the Bayesian machinery involved in model calibration. Then, we
demonstrate it in one example: calibration of a vehicle dynamics model that has
low degree of freedom count and can be used for state estimation, model
predictive control, or path planning. A high fidelity simulator is used to
emulate the ``experiments'' and generate the data for the calibration. The
merit of this work is not tied to a new Bayesian methodology for calibration,
but to the demonstration of how the Bayesian machinery can establish
connections among models in computational dynamics, even when the data in use
is noisy. The software used to generate the results reported herein is
available in a public repository for unfettered use and distribution.

reliable operation of electrical power conversion systems. The small size and
versatility of switched-mode power converters has resulted in their widespread
adoption. Whereas transformer-based systems passively convert voltage,
switched-mode converters feature an actively regulated feedback loop, which
relies on accurate sensor measurements. Previous academic work has shown that
many types of sensors are vulnerable to Intentional Electromagnetic
Interference (IEMI) attacks, and it has been postulated that power converters,
too, are affected.
  In this paper, we present the first detailed study on switched-mode power
converters by targeting their voltage and current sensors through IEMI attacks.
We present a theoretical framework for evaluating IEMI attacks against
feedback-based power supplies in the general case. We experimentally validate
our theoretical predictions by analyzing multiple AC-DC and DC-DC converters,
automotive grade current sensors, and dedicated battery chargers, and
demonstrate the systematic vulnerability of all examined categories under
real-world conditions. Finally, we demonstrate that sensor attacks on power
converters can cause permanent damage to Li-Ion batteries during the charging

systems can cause catastrophic real-world damage by infecting device binaries
with malware. Mitigating such attacks can benefit from reverse engineering
tools that recover sufficient semantic knowledge in terms of mathematical
operations in the code. Conventional reverse engineering tools can decompile
binaries to low-level code, but offer little semantic insight. This paper
proposes REMaQE, an automated framework for reverse engineering of math
equations from binary executables. REMaQE uses symbolic execution for dynamic
analysis of the binary to extract the relevant semantic knowledge of the
implemented algorithms. REMaQE provides an automatic parameter analysis pass
which also leverages symbolic execution to identify input, output, and constant
parameters of the implemented math equations. REMaQE automatically handles
parameters accessed via registers, the stack, global memory, or pointers, and
supports reverse engineering of object-oriented implementations such as C++
classes. REMaQE uses an algebraic simplification method which allows it to
scale to complex conditional equations with ease. These features make REMaQE
stand out over existing reverse engineering approaches for math equations. On a
dataset of randomly generated math equations compiled to binaries from C and
Simulink implementations, REMaQE accurately recovers a semantically matching
equation for 97.53% of the models. For complex equations with more operations,
accuracy stays consistently over 94%. REMaQE executes in 0.25 seconds on
average and in 1.3 seconds for more complex equations. This real-time execution
speed enables a smooth integration in an interactive mathematics-oriented
reverse engineering workflow.

transformation and permutation of the chains. Using bosonization, we show that,
in the low-energy limit, the system is described by the quantum
double-frequency sine-Gordon model. On the basis of this correspondence, a rich

combined effect of the magnetic flux, frustration, and many-body correlations.

within the region that was magnetically connected to PSP during intervals that

explanation for the power of depth, which consists of two parts: i) there
exists a function representable by a deep network; ii) such a function cannot

However, this theory is established for feedforward networks. Few studies, if
not none, considered the depth separation theory in the context of shortcuts

functional space analysis. Then, we modify the depth separation theory by
showing that a shallow network with intra-layer links does not need to go as
wide as before to express some hard functions constructed by a deep network.
Such functions include the renowned ""sawtooth"" functions. Moreover, the saving
of width is up to linear. Our results supplement the existing depth separation

  Using a Parametric Model",,,,,"cs.LG physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we demonstrate a sequential experimental design for spectral
measurements by active learning using parametric models as predictors. In
spectral measurements, it is necessary to reduce the measurement time because
of sample fragility and high energy costs. To improve the efficiency of
experiments, sequential experimental designs are proposed, in which the
subsequent measurement is designed by active learning using the data obtained
before the measurement. Conventionally, parametric models are employed in data
analysis; when employed for active learning, they are expected to afford a
sequential experimental design that improves the accuracy of data analysis.
However, due to the complexity of the formulas, a sequential experimental
design using general parametric models has not been realized. Therefore, we
applied Bayesian inference-based data analysis using the exchange Monte Carlo
method to realize a sequential experimental design with general parametric
models. In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed method by
applying it to Bayesian spectral deconvolution and Bayesian Hamiltonian
selection in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Using numerical experiments with
artificial data, we demonstrated that the proposed method improves the accuracy
of model selection and parameter estimation while reducing the measurement time
compared with the results achieved without active learning or with active
learning using the Gaussian process regression.

and is a prime tool for solving diverse hydrodynamic equations in the linear
regime. In the present contribution, the axisymmetric low-Reynolds-number
Brinkman flow induced by monopole and dipole singularities in proximity of a
stationary plate of circular shape is theoretically investigated. The flow
singularities are directed along the central axis of the plate. No-slip
boundary conditions are assumed to hold at the surface of the plate. The
Green's functions are determined to a large extent analytically, reducing the
solution of the linear hydrodynamic equations to well-behaved one-dimensional
integrals amenable to numerical computation. In our approach, the Brinkman flow
problem is formulated as a mixed boundary value problem that is subsequently
mapped in the form of dual integral equations on the domain boundaries.
Thereupon, the solution of the equations of fluid motion is eventually reduced
to the solution of two independent Fredholm integral equations of the first
kind. The overall flow structure and emerging eddy patterns are found to
strongly depend on the magnitude of the dimensionless impermeability and
relevant geometrical parameters of the system. Moreover, the effect of the
confining plate on the dynamics of externally driven or force-free particles is
assessed through the calculation of the relevant hydrodynamic reaction
functions. The effect of the plate on the locomotory behavior of a
self-propelling active dipole swimmer is shown to be maximum when the distance
separating the swimmer from the plate is comparable to the radius of the plate.
Our results may prove useful for characterizing transport processes in
microfluidic devices and may pave the way toward understanding and controlling
of small-scale flows in porous media.

affect detection model performance. To fill this void, this paper introduces a
toxicity inspector framework that incorporates a human-in-the-loop pipeline
with the aim of enhancing the reliability of toxicity benchmark datasets by
centering the evaluator's values through an iterative feedback cycle. The
centerpiece of this framework is the iterative feedback process, which is
guided by two metric types (hard and soft) that provide evaluators and dataset
creators with insightful examination to balance the tradeoff between

transitioning from traditional hand-drawn designs to modern automated design

building design and provide a more systematic approach. Platform-based design
(PBD), originally developed in the electronic industry, enables efficient
design processes by promoting the reuse of hardware and software systems. It

the design process. We also present a case study that demonstrates the use of

  in Semiconductor Supply and Demand",,,,,"cs.AR cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Mitigating losses from supply and demand volatility in the semiconductor
supply chain and market has traditionally been cast as a logistics and
forecasting problem. We investigate how the architecture of a family of chips
influences how it is affected by supply and demand uncertainties. We observe
that semiconductor supply chains become fragile, in part, due to single demand
paths, where one chip can satisfy only one demand. Chip architects can enable
multiple paths to satisfy a chip demand, which improves supply chain
resilience. Based on this observation, we study composition and adaptation as
architectural strategies to improve resilience to volatility and also introduce
a third strategy of dispersion. These strategies allow multiple paths to
satisfy a given chip demand. We develop a model to analyze the impact of these
architectural techniques on supply chain costs under different regimes of
uncertainties and evaluate what happens when they are combined. We present
several interesting and even counterintuitive observations about the product
configurations and market conditions where these interventions are impactful
and where they are not. In all, we show that product redesign supported by
architectural changes can mitigate nearly half of the losses caused by supply
and demand volatility. As far as we know, this is the first such investigation
concerning chip architecture.

  Poisson--Boltzmann equation for electrostatics in molecular solvation",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Poisson--Boltzmann equation is widely used to model electrostatics in
molecular systems. Available software packages solve it using finite
difference, finite element, and boundary element methods, where the latter is
attractive due to the accurate representation of the molecular surface and
partial charges, and exact enforcement of the boundary conditions at infinity.
However, the boundary element method is limited to linear equations and
piecewise constant variations of the material properties. In this work, we
present a scheme that couples finite and boundary elements for the
Poisson--Boltzmann equation, where the finite element method is applied in a
confined {\it solute} region, and the boundary element method in the external
{\it solvent} region. As a proof-of-concept exercise, we use the simplest
methods available: Johnson--N\'ed\'elec coupling with mass matrix and diagonal
preconditioning, implemented using the Bempp-cl and FEniCSx libraries via their
Python interfaces. We showcase our implementation by computing the polar
component of the solvation free energy of a set of molecules using a constant
and a Gaussian-varying permittivity. We validate our implementation against the
finite difference code APBS (to 0.5\%), and show scaling from protein G B1 (955
atoms) up to immunoglobulin G (20\,148 atoms). For small problems, the coupled
method was efficient, outperforming a purely boundary integral approach. For
Gaussian-varying permittivities, which are beyond the applicability of boundary
elements alone, we were able to run medium to large sized problems on a single
workstation. Development of better preconditioning techniques and the use of
distributed memory parallelism for larger systems remains an area for future
work. We hope this work will serve as inspiration for future developments for
molecular electrostatics with implicit solvent models.

shows how the solution solves classical paradoxes (such as the original Liar)
as well as the paradoxes that were invented as counterarguments for various
proposed solutions (the revenge of the Liar). This solution complements the
classical procedure of determining the truth values of sentences by its own
failure and, when the procedure fails, through an appropriate semantic shift
allows us to express the failure in a classical two-valued language. Formally
speaking, the solution is a language with one meaning of symbols and two
valuations of the truth values of sentences. The primary valuation is a
classical valuation that is partial in the presence of the truth predicate. It
enables us to determine the classical truth value of a sentence or leads to the
failure of that determination. The language with the primary valuation is
precisely the largest intrinsic fixed point of the strong Kleene three-valued
semantics (LIFPSK3). The semantic shift that allows us to express the failure
of the primary valuation is precisely the classical closure of LIFPSK3: it
extends LIFPSK3 to a classical language in parts where LIFPSK3 is undetermined.
Thus, this article provides an argumentation, which has not been present in
contemporary debates so far, for the choice of LIFPSK3 and its classical
closure as the right model for the truth predicate. In the end, an erroneous
critique of Kripke-Feferman axiomatic theory of truth, which is present in

including PDE-based loss functions, physics laws such as mass balance are
enforced softly. In this paper, we examine how well mass balance constraints
are satisfied when PINNs are used to solve the resulting PDEs. We investigate
PINN's ability to solve the 1D saturated groundwater flow equations for
homogeneous and heterogeneous media and evaluate the local and global mass
balance errors. We compare the obtained PINN's numerical solution and
associated mass balance errors against a two-point finite volume numerical
method and the corresponding analytical solution. We also evaluate the accuracy
of PINN to solve the 1D saturated groundwater flow equation with and without
incorporating hydraulic head as training data. Our results showed that one
needs to provide hydraulic head data to obtain an accurate solution for the
head for the heterogeneous case. That is, only after adding data at some
collocation points the PINN methodology was able to give a solution close to
the finite volume and analytical solutions. In addition, we demonstrate that
even after adding hydraulic head data at some collocation points, the resulting
local mass balance errors are still significant at the other collocation points
compared to the finite volume approach. Tuning the PINN's hyperparameters such
as the number of collocation points, epochs, and learning rate did not improve
the solution accuracy or the mass balance errors compared to the finite volume

paradigm in the modelling of brain workings and evolution. In particular, the
models should include the possibility of dynamic synaptic weights $T_{ij}$ in
the neuron--neuron interaction matrix, radically overcoming the classical
Hopfield setting. Krotov and Hopfield proposed a non constant, still symmetric
model, leading to a vector field describing a gradient type dynamics and then
including a Lyapunov--like energy function. In this note, we firstly will
detail the general condition to produce a Hopfield like vector field of
gradient type obtaining, as a particular case, the Krotov-Hopfield condition.
Secondly, we abandon the symmetry because of two relevant physiological facts:
(1) the actual neural connections have a marked directional character and (2)
the gradient structure deriving from the symmetry forces the dynamics always
towards stationary points, prescribing every pattern to be recognized. We
propose a novel model including a set limited but varying controls
$|\xi_{ij}|\leq K$ used for correcting a starting constant interaction matrix,
$T_{ij}=A_{ij}+\xi_{ij}$. Besides, we introduce a reasonable family of
controlled variational functionals to be optimized. This allows us to reproduce
the following three possible outcomes when submitting a pattern to the learning
system. If (1) the dynamics leads to an already existing stationary point
without activating the controls, the system has \emph{recognized} an existing
pattern. If (2) a new stationary point is reached by the activation of
controls, then the system has \emph{learned} a new pattern. If (3) the dynamics
is unable to reach neither existing or new stationary points, then the system
is unable to recognize or learn the pattern submitted. A further feature (4),

in machine learning and data mining. Its successful applications span various
fields. However, conventional clustering techniques necessitate the
consideration of balance significance in specific applications. Therefore, this
paper addresses the challenge of imbalanced clustering problems and presents a
new method for balanced clustering by utilizing entropy-aware similarity, which
can be defined as the degree of balances. We have coined the term,
entropy-aware similarity for balanced clustering (EASB), which maximizes
balance during clustering by complementary clustering of unbalanced data and
incorporating entropy in a novel similarity formula that accounts for both
angular differences and distances. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
is evaluated on actual melanoma medial data, specifically the International
Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019 and 2020 challenge datasets, to
demonstrate how it can successfully cluster the data while preserving balance.
Lastly, we can confirm that the proposed method exhibited outstanding
performance in detecting melanoma, comparing to classical methods.

the privacy of users when transferring the knowledge from source domain to

development of recommender systems. Existing work on cross-domain
recommendation (CDR) reaches advanced and satisfying recommendation
performance, but mostly neglects preserving privacy. To fill this gap, we
propose a privacy-preserving generative cross-domain recommendation (PPGenCDR)
framework for PPCDR. PPGenCDR includes two main modules, i.e., stable
privacy-preserving generator module, and robust cross-domain recommendation
module. Specifically, the former isolates data from different domains with a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based model, which stably estimates the
distribution of private data in the source domain with Renyi differential
privacy (RDP) technique. Then the latter aims to robustly leverage the
perturbed but effective knowledge from the source domain with the raw data in
target domain to improve recommendation performance. Three key modules, i.e.,
(1) selective privacy preserver, (2) GAN stabilizer, and (3) robustness
conductor, guarantee the cost-effective trade-off between utility and privacy,
the stability of GAN when using RDP, and the robustness of leveraging
transferable knowledge accordingly. The extensive empirical studies on Douban
and Amazon datasets demonstrate that PPGenCDR significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art recommendation models while preserving privacy.

different criteria for choosing the representative pixel and find that the

paramount to explain and control its behaviour. Inferring the causal graph from
observational data without interventions, however, requires a lot of strong
assumptions that are not always realistic. Even for domain experts it can be
challenging to express the causal graph. Therefore, metrics that quantitatively
assess the goodness of a causal graph provide helpful checks before using it in
downstream tasks. Existing metrics provide an absolute number of
inconsistencies between the graph and the observed data, and without a
baseline, practitioners are left to answer the hard question of how many such
inconsistencies are acceptable or expected. Here, we propose a novel
consistency metric by constructing a surrogate baseline through node
permutations. By comparing the number of inconsistencies with those on the
surrogate baseline, we derive an interpretable metric that captures whether the
DAG fits significantly better than random. Evaluating on both simulated and
real data sets from various domains, including biology and cloud monitoring, we
demonstrate that the true DAG is not falsified by our metric, whereas the wrong
graphs given by a hypothetical user are likely to be falsified.

  multipartite processes","8 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many dynamical systems consist of multiple, co-evolving subsystems (degrees
of freedom). These subsystems often depend upon each other in a way that
restricts the overall system's dynamics. How does this network of dependencies
affect the system's thermodynamics? Prior studies in the stochastic
thermodynamics of multipartite processes (MPPs) have approached this question
by restricting the system to allow only one subsystem to change state at a
time. However, in many real systems, such as chemical reaction networks or
electronic circuits, multiple subsystems must change state together. Therefore,
studies of MPPs do not apply to such systems. Here, we investigate the
thermodynamics of composite processes, in which subsets of subsystems are
allowed to change state simultaneously. These subsets correspond to the
subsystems that interact with a single mechanism (e.g., a thermal or chemical
reservoir) that is coupled to the system. An MPP is simply a (subcase of a)
composite process in which all such subsets have cardinality one. We
demonstrate the power of the composite systems framework to study the
thermodynamics of multiple, co-evolving subsystems. In particular, we derive
thermodynamic uncertainty relations for information flows in composite
processes. We also derive strengthened speed limits for composite processes.
Our results apply to a much broader class of dynamical systems than do results
for MPPs, and could guide future studies of the thermodynamics of distributed

Few targeted and task-agnostic methods use manually pre-defined triggers and

general. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements that a more
threatening backdoor attack against PLMs should satisfy, and then propose a new
backdoor attack method called UOR, which breaks the bottleneck of the previous

we define poisoned supervised contrastive learning which can automatically
learn the more uniform and universal output representations of triggers for
various PLMs. Moreover, we use gradient search to select appropriate trigger
words which can be adaptive to different PLMs and vocabularies. Experiments
show that our method can achieve better attack performance on various text

on PLMs with different architectures, different usage paradigms, and more
difficult tasks, which demonstrated the universality of our method.

Monte Carlo sampling, and to switch seamlessly between the two. The approach is
discussed in the context of auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) but is
applicable to other Monte Carlo calculations or simulations. In AFQMC, the
formulation of branching random walks along imaginary-time is needed to realize
a constraint to control the sign or phase problem. The constraint is derived
from an exact gauge condition, and is in practice implemented approximately
with a trial wave function or trial density matrix, which can break exactness
in the algorithm. We use the generalized Metropolis algorithm to sample a
selected portion of the imaginary-time path after it has been produced by the
branching random walk. This interfacing allows a constraint release to follow
seamlessly from the constrained-path sampling, which can reduce the systematic
error from the latter. It also provides a way to improve the computation of
correlation functions and observables that do not commute with the Hamiltonian.
We illustrate the method in atoms and molecules, where improvements in accuracy
can be clearly quantified and near-exact results are obtained. We also discuss
the computation of the variance of the Hamiltonian and propose a convenient way
to evaluate it stochastically without changing the scaling of AFQMC.

that end, we employ the Helmholtz decomposition of the space H(curl) and
construct an orthonormal basis for this space in two and three spatial

significantly higher sample complexity than non-private learners as is the case
with, e.g., learning of one-dimensional threshold functions [Bun et al., FOCS

  We explore prediction as an alternative to learning. Instead of putting
forward a hypothesis, a predictor answers a stream of classification queries.
Earlier work has considered a private prediction model with just a single
classification query [Dwork and Feldman, COLT 2018]. We observe that when
answering a stream of queries, a predictor must modify the hypothesis it uses
over time, and, furthermore, that it must use the queries for this
modification, hence introducing potential privacy risks with respect to the
queries themselves.
  We introduce private everlasting prediction taking into account the privacy
of both the training set and the (adaptively chosen) queries made to the
predictor. We then present a generic construction of private everlasting
predictors in the PAC model. The sample complexity of the initial training
sample in our construction is quadratic (up to polylog factors) in the VC
dimension of the concept class. Our construction allows prediction for all
concept classes with finite VC dimension, and in particular threshold functions
with constant size initial training sample, even when considered over infinite
domains, whereas it is known that the sample complexity of privately learning
threshold functions must grow as a function of the domain size and hence is
impossible for infinite domains.

we create a system that, starting from a given grasp, uses proprioceptive

slip between the gripper and handle limits the performance. Nonetheless, we
find that the system already performs quite well. This poses the question:
should we make more use of proprioceptive information during contact in
articulated object manipulation systems, or is it not worth the added

transitions are embedded in the fine-structure splitting of the $nd^4$, $nd^5$

have lifetimes and quality factors many orders of magnitude longer and larger,

also orders of magnitude smaller, rendering them more stable against external

work uses existing robotic tools to approximate this normalizer. In this paper,
we group previous approaches into three fundamental classes and analyze the
theoretical pros and cons of their approach. We then leverage recent research
from the statistics community to introduce Double MH reward learning, a Monte
Carlo method for asymptotically learning the human's reward in continuous
spaces. We extend Double MH to conditionally independent settings (where each
human correction is viewed as completely separate) and conditionally dependent
environments (where the human's current correction may build on previous
inputs). Across simulations and user studies, our proposed approach infers the
human's reward parameters more accurately than the alternate approximations
when learning from either demonstrations or corrections. See videos here:

debate. This work aims to localize the VHE (100 GeV-100 TeV) gamma-ray emission
from M87 and probe a potential extended hadronic emission component in the
inner Virgo Cluster. The search for a steady and extended gamma-ray signal
around M87 can constrain the cosmic-ray energy density and the pressure exerted
by the cosmic rays onto the intra-cluster medium, and allow us to investigate
the role of the cosmic rays in the active galactic nucleus feedback as a
heating mechanism in the Virgo Cluster. H.E.S.S. telescopes are sensitive to
VHE gamma rays and have been utilized to observe M87 since 2004. We utilized a
Bayesian block analysis to identify M87 emission states with H.E.S.S.
observations from 2004 until 2021, dividing them into low, intermediate, and
high states. Because of the causality argument, an extended ($\gtrsim$kpc)
signal is allowed only in steady emission states. Hence, we fitted the
morphology of the 120h low state data and found no significant gamma-ray
extension. Therefore, we derived for the low state an upper limit of
58""(corresponding to $\approx$4.6kpc) in the extension of a single-component
morphological model described by a rotationally symmetric 2D Gaussian model at
99.7% confidence level. Our results exclude the radio lobes ($\approx$30 kpc)
as the principal component of the VHE gamma-ray emission from the low state of
M87. The gamma-ray emission is compatible with a single emission region at the
radio core of M87. These results, with the help of two multiple-component
models, constrain the maximum cosmic-ray to thermal pressure ratio
$X_{{CR,max.}}$$\lesssim$$0.32$ and the total energy in cosmic-ray protons
(CRp) to $U_{CR}$$\lesssim$5$\times10^{58}$ erg in the inner 20kpc of the Virgo
Cluster for an assumed CRp power-law distribution in momentum with spectral

Existing

To overcome this limitation, recent autoregressive search engines replace the

  Surprisingly, when providing a few {Query-URL} pairs as in-context

corresponding documents contain correct answers to open-domain questions. In
this way, LLMs can be thought of as built-in search engines, since they have

  Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed significant progress in medical
question answering; Med-PaLM was the first model to exceed a ""passing"" score in
US Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) style questions with a score of 67.2%
on the MedQA dataset. However, this and other prior work suggested significant
room for improvement, especially when models' answers were compared to
clinicians' answers. Here we present Med-PaLM 2, which bridges these gaps by
leveraging a combination of base LLM improvements (PaLM 2), medical domain
finetuning, and prompting strategies including a novel ensemble refinement
approach.
  Med-PaLM 2 scored up to 86.5% on the MedQA dataset, improving upon Med-PaLM
by over 19% and setting a new state-of-the-art. We also observed performance
approaching or exceeding state-of-the-art across MedMCQA, PubMedQA, and MMLU

  We performed detailed human evaluations on long-form questions along multiple

produced by physicians on eight of nine axes pertaining to clinical utility (p

found that many studies use similar model architectures, with little comparison

is a crucial topic, with no consistent method for its generation. Furthermore,
many studies demonstrate that artificial data suffers from generalization
issues when tested on in-vivo data. We also conclude that risks related to ML

mixing in intermediate mass stars. However, theoretical pulsation periods of
stellar models remain in tension with observations, and it is often unclear how
the models of these stars should be further improved. Inversions provide a path
forward by directly probing the internal structure of these stars from their
pulsation periods, quantifying which parts of the model are in need of
improvement. This method has been used for solar-like pulsators, but has not
yet been applied to main-sequence gravity-mode pulsators. Our aim is to
determine whether structure inversions for gravity-mode pulsators are feasible.
We focus on the case of slowly rotating SPB stars. We computed and analyzed
dipole mode kernels for three variables pairs: $(\rho,c), (N^2,c)$, and
$(N^2,\rho)$. We assessed the potential of these kernels by predicting the
oscillation frequencies of a model after perturbing its structure. We then
tested two inversion methods, RLS and SOLA, using a model grid computed with
MESA and GYRE. We find that changing the stellar structure affects the
oscillation frequencies in a nonlinear way. The oscillation modes for which
this nonlinear dependency is the strongest are in resonance with the near-core
peak in the buoyancy frequency. The near core region of the star can be probed
with SOLA, while RLS requires fine tuning to obtain accurate results. Both RLS
and SOLA are strongly affected by the nonlinear dependencies on the structure
differences, as these methods are based on a first-order approximation. These
inversion methods need to be modified for meaningful applications of inversions
to SPB stars. Our results show that inversions of gravity-mode pulsators are
possible in principle, but that the typical inversion methods developed for
solar-like oscillators are not applicable. [abridged]

is used to learn the map from parameters to POD latent variables, which can
also alleviate the impact of noise. CVAE-GPRR can achieve the similar accuracy
to CVAE but with fewer parameters. In the likelihood model, neural networks are
used to reconstruct data. Besides the samples of POD latent variables and input
parameters, physical variables are also added as the inputs to make predictions
in the whole physical space. This can not be achieved by either GPR-based ROM
or CVAE. Moreover, the numerical results show that CVAE-GPRR may alleviate the
overfitting issue in CVAE.

gradually releasing new products or updates through a sequence of A/B tests in
which the number of treated units gradually grows until full deployment or
deprecation. Performing phased releases in a principled way requires selecting
the proportion of units assigned to the new release in a way that balances the
risk of an adverse effect with the need to iterate and learn from the
experiment rapidly. In this paper, we formalize this problem and propose an
algorithm that automatically determines the release percentage at each stage in
the schedule, balancing the need to control risk while maximizing ramp-up
speed. Our framework models the challenge as a constrained batched bandit
problem that ensures that our pre-specified experimental budget is not depleted
with high probability. Our proposed algorithm leverages an adaptive Bayesian
approach in which the maximal number of units assigned to the treatment is
determined by the posterior distribution, ensuring that the probability of
depleting the remaining budget is low. Notably, our approach analytically
solves the ramp sizes by inverting probability bounds, eliminating the need for
challenging rare-event Monte Carlo simulation. It only requires computing means
and variances of outcome subsets, making it highly efficient and
parallelizable.

with observed profiles which are generally available at low redshift, we find
that (1) the agreements between the two runs and observations are mostly at
outer radii $r \gtrsim 0.3r_{500}$, in line with the self-similarity
assumption. While Gadget-X shows better agreements with the observed gas
profiles in the central regions compared to GIZMO-SIMBA; (2) the evolution

better consistency at outer radii. In detail, the gas density profile shows
less discrepancy than the temperature and entropy profiles at high redshift.
The differences in the cluster centre and gas properties imply different

be caused by the star formation and feedback models or hydrodynamics treatment,

At the leading order in $\alpha$, which is $O(\alpha^5)$ in the hyperfine
splitting (hfs), these effects are usually evaluated in a data-driven fashion,
using the empirical information on the proton electromagnetic form factors and
spin structure functions. Here we perform a first calculation based on the
baryon chiral perturbation theory (B$\chi$PT). At leading orders it provides a
prediction for the proton polarizability effects in hydrogen (H) and muonic
hydrogen ($\mu$H). We find large cancellations among the various contributions
leading to, within the uncertainties, a zero polarizability effect at leading
order in the B$\chi$PT expansion. This result is in significant disagreement
with the current data-driven evaluations. The small polarizability effect
implies a smaller Zemach radius $R_\mathrm{Z}$, if one uses the well-known
experimental $1S$ hfs in H or the $2S$ hfs in $\mu$H. We, respectively, obtain
$R_\mathrm{Z}(\mathrm{H}) = 1.010(9)$ fm, $R_\mathrm{Z}(\mu\mathrm{H}) =
1.040(33)$ fm. The total proton-structure effect to the hfs at $O(\alpha^5)$ is
then consistent with previous evaluations; the discrepancy in the
polarizability is compensated by the smaller Zemach radius. Our recommended
value for the $1S$ hfs in $\mu\text{H}$ is $182.640(18)\,\mathrm{meV}.$

accounting for the effects of chromatic dispersion on photon
indistinguishability. For quantum-repeater chains we numerically investigate
how uneven spacing between repeater nodes leads to bottlenecks, thereby
increasing both the waiting time and the time states are stored in noisy
quantum memory. We find that while the time required to perform one entangling
attempt may increase linearly with the midpoint's asymmetry, the success
probability and fidelity of heralded entanglement generation and the

attention to observed BOSS galaxies at z=0.31-0.43, and we attempt to reproduce

best-fitting cosmological parameters from Planck and the other from weak
gravitational lensing surveys (Low S8), where the amplitude of matter
fluctuations is lower for the latter. We find excellent agreement between SHAMe
predictions and observations for both cosmologies, indicating that the
lensing-is-low problem originates from approximations in previous theoretical
descriptions of the data. The main difference between SHAMe results in these
cosmologies is the level of galaxy assembly bias, which is approximately 20 and
10% for Planck and Low S8, respectively. These results highlight the dangers of

methods for taking advantage of it. We analyze two families of unitaries that

we show that the $\operatorname{Ext}^1$ groups are equivalent to small groups,
leaving open the question of whether the higher Ext groups are essentially
small as well. We also show that the $\operatorname{Ext}^1$ groups take on the

  When interpreted into an $\infty$-topos of sheaves on a 1-category, our Ext
groups recover (and give a resolution-free approach to) sheaf Ext groups, which
arise in algebraic geometry. (These are also called ""local"" Ext groups.) We may
therefore interpret results about Ext from HoTT and apply them to sheaf Ext. To
show this, we prove that injectivity of modules in HoTT interprets to internal
injectivity in these models. It follows, for example, that sheaf Ext can be
computed using resolutions which are projective or injective in the sense of
HoTT, when they exist, and we give an example of this in the projective case.

diverse as physics, finance or climate studies. Until now, general methods for
determining record age statistics have been limited to observations of either
independent random variables or successive positions of a Markovian

effects cannot be neglected. Examples of time series involving memory effects
include data of soil and air temperatures, river flows, nucleotide sequence

large language models~(LLMs) over structured data in a unified way. Inspired by
the study on tool augmentation for LLMs, we develop an \emph{Iterative
Reading-then-Reasoning~(IRR)} approach for solving question answering tasks
based on structured data, called \textbf{StructGPT}. In our approach, we
construct the specialized function to collect relevant evidence from structured
data (\ie \emph{reading}), and let LLMs concentrate the reasoning task based on
the collected information (\ie \emph{reasoning}). Specially, we propose an
\emph{invoking-linearization-generation} procedure to support LLMs in reasoning
on the structured data with the help of the external interfaces. By iterating
this procedures with provided interfaces, our approach can gradually approach
the target answer to a given query. Extensive experiments conducted on three
types of structured data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which
can significantly boost the performance of ChatGPT and achieve comparable
performance against the full-data supervised-tuning baselines. Our codes and
data are publicly available at~\url{https://github.com/RUCAIBox/StructGPT}.

models to downstream tasks or aligning with human preferences. Prompt learning
is widely used in NLP but has limited applicability to RL due to the complex
physical meaning and environment-specific information contained within RL
prompts. These factors require supervised learning to imitate the
demonstrations and may result in a loss of meaning after learning.
Additionally, directly extending prompt-tuning approaches to RL is challenging
because RL prompts guide agent behavior based on environmental modeling and
analysis, rather than filling in missing information, making it unlikely that
adjustments to the prompt format for downstream tasks, as in NLP, can yield
significant improvements. In this work, we propose the Prompt-Tuning DT
algorithm to address these challenges by using trajectory segments as prompts
to guide RL agents in acquiring environmental information and optimizing
prompts via black-box tuning to enhance their ability to contain more relevant
information, thereby enabling agents to make better decisions. Our approach
involves randomly sampling a Gaussian distribution to fine-tune the elements of
the prompt trajectory and using preference ranking function to find the
optimization direction, thereby providing more informative prompts and guiding
the agent towards specific preferences in the target environment. Extensive
experiments show that with only 0.03% of the parameters learned, Prompt-Tuning
DT achieves comparable or even better performance than full-model fine-tuning
in low-data scenarios. Our work contributes to the advancement of prompt-tuning
approaches in RL, providing a promising direction for optimizing large RL
agents for specific preference tasks.

explain the strong scattering slopes and muted spectral features observed in
the transmission spectra of many hot Jupiters. Absorption and scattering by
photochemical hazes have the potential to drastically alter temperature
structure and atmospheric circulation of these planets but have previously been
neglected in general circulation models (GCMs). We present GCM simulations of
hot Jupiter HD 189733b that include photochemical hazes as a radiatively active
tracer fully coupled to atmospheric dynamics. The influence of haze radiative
feedback strongly depends on the assumed haze optical properties. For soot
hazes, two distinct thermal inversions form, separated by a local temperature
minimum around 10$^{-5}$ bar caused by upwelling on the dayside mixing air with
low haze abundance upwards. The equatorial jet broadens and slows down. The
horizontal distribution of hazes remains relatively similar to simulations with
radiatively passive tracers. For Titan-type hazes, the equatorial jet
accelerates and extends to much lower pressures, resulting in a dramatically
different 3D distribution of hazes compared to radiatively passive or soot
hazes. Further experimental and observational studies to constrain the optical
properties of photochemical hazes will therefore be crucial for understanding
the role of hazes in exoplanet atmospheres. In the dayside emission spectrum,
for both types of hazes the amplitude of near-infrared features is reduced,
while the emitted flux at longer wavelengths ($>$4 $\mu$m) increases. Haze
radiative feedback leads to increased phase curve amplitudes in many infrared
wavelength regions, mostly due to stronger dayside emission.

forward reasoning (e.g., straightforward arithmetic), it is less effective for
constraint solving problems that require more sophisticated planning and
search. In this paper, we propose a new satisfiability-aided language modeling
(SATLM) approach for improving the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use an
LLM to generate a declarative task specification rather than an imperative
program and leverage an off-the-shelf automated theorem prover to derive the
final answer. This approach has two key advantages. The declarative
specification is closer to the problem description than the reasoning steps
are, so the LLM can parse it out of the description more accurately.
Furthermore, by offloading the actual reasoning task to an automated theorem
prover, our approach can guarantee the correctness of the answer with respect
to the parsed specification and avoid planning errors in the solving process.
We evaluate SATLM on 6 different datasets and show that it consistently
outperforms program-aided LMs in an imperative paradigm. In particular, SATLM
outperforms program-aided LMs by 23% on a challenging subset of the GSM

particle which is BPS when gravity is decoupled, but is non-BPS and metastable
when gravity is switched on. Geometrically, this monopole is obtained from
branes wrapped on locally stable but globally trivial cycles of a
compactification geometry. The fluxbrane picture allows us to characterize
electric (resp. magnetic) confinement (resp. screening) in the 4D theory as a
result of monopole decay. In the presence of the fluxbrane, this decay also
creates lower-dimensional fluxbranes, which in the field theory is interpreted
as the creation of an additional topological field theory sector.

  Three Weeks",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Annotating medical images, particularly for organ segmentation, is laborious
and time-consuming. For example, annotating an abdominal organ requires an
estimated rate of 30-60 minutes per CT volume based on the expertise of an
annotator and the size, visibility, and complexity of the organ. Therefore,
publicly available datasets for multi-organ segmentation are often limited in
data size and organ diversity. This paper proposes a systematic and efficient
method to expedite the annotation process for organ segmentation. We have
created the largest multi-organ dataset (by far) with the spleen, liver,
kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and IVC annotated in 8,448 CT
volumes, equating to 3.2 million slices. The conventional annotation methods
would take an experienced annotator up to 1,600 weeks (or roughly 30.8 years)
to complete this task. In contrast, our annotation method has accomplished this
task in three weeks (based on an 8-hour workday, five days a week) while
maintaining a similar or even better annotation quality. This achievement is
attributed to three unique properties of our method: (1) label bias reduction
using multiple pre-trained segmentation models, (2) effective error detection
in the model predictions, and (3) attention guidance for annotators to make
corrections on the most salient errors. Furthermore, we summarize the taxonomy
of common errors made by AI algorithms and annotators. This allows for
continuous refinement of both AI and annotations and significantly reduces the
annotation costs required to create large-scale datasets for a wider variety of
medical imaging tasks.

luminosity brings down the gas mass to a value consistent with typical
star-forming galaxies at that redshift (log$(M_{\rm

remains elevated above the scaling relations by a factor of 5. We explore the
potential physical picture and consider an underestimated stellar mass and
optically thick dust as possible causes. Based on the updated gas-to-stellar
mass ratio we rule out the former, and while the latter can contribute to the
dust mass overestimate it is still not sufficient to explain the observed
physical picture. Instead, possible explanations include enhanced HI
reservoirs, CO-dark H$_2$ gas, an unusually high metallicity, or the presence
of an optically dark, dusty contaminant. Using the ALMA data at 870 $\mu$m
coupled with $HST$/ACS imaging, we find extended morphology in dust continuum
and clumpy star-formation in rest-frame UV in this galaxy, and a tentative
$\sim 10$ kpc dusty arm is found bridging the galaxy center and a clump in
F814W image. The galaxy shows levels of dust obscuration similar to the
so-called $HST$-dark galaxies at higher redshifts, and would fall into the
optically faint/dark $JWST$ color-color selection at $z>2$. It is therefore
possible that our object could serve as low-$z$ analog of the $HST$-dark

call a boundary strongly symmetric if the corresponding boundary state is an

bifurcate for non-invertible symmetries. We discuss the relation to anomalies,
where we observe that it is sometimes possible to gauge a non-invertible
symmetry in a generalized sense even though it is incompatible with a trivially
gapped phase. The analysis of symmetric boundaries further leads to constraints
on bulk and boundary renormalization group flows. In 2+1d, we study the action

significant evolution in the dust emissivity index across cosmic time,
measuring a consistent value of $\beta_\text{IR} = 1.8 \pm 0.3$ at $z > 4$,
suggesting the effective dust properties do not change dramatically for most

in terms of dust temperature ($T_\text{dust} > 40 \, \mathrm{K}$) and IR
luminosity ($L_\text{IR} > 10^{11} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$). We find the dust
temperature evolves mildly towards high redshift, though the LIRGs and quasars
exhibit elevated temperatures indicating a more efficient and/or additional
heating mechanism. Where available, we compare stellar-mass estimates to our
inferred dust masses, whose degeneracy with dust temperature can only be
mitigated with a well-constrained SED. In merely half of the cases the dust
yield may be explained by supernovae alone, with four sources ($44\%$)
significantly exceeding a highly optimistic yield where $M_\text{dust} \approx
0.01 M_*$. We discuss possible explanations for this apparent inconsistency and
potential observational biases in the measurements of the dust properties of
high-redshift galaxies, including in the current IR-bright sample.

sequence up to the Kraft break. There is a clear period gap (or minimum)

binary companions between any of these groups and control samples of
photometric twin stars built for each group.

In a factorization approach to DPS, the initial state is described by double
parton distributions (DPDs). These are currently poorly constrained by

the hadron. Here we show that the Large Momentum Effective Theory approach can
be applied to DPDs. Specifically, we present a general matching relation
between DPDs and lattice-calculable quasi-DPDs for general flavor, spin and
color structures. We furthermore calculate the one-loop matching coefficients
for the quark-quark DPDs, verifying that the infrared logarithms and
divergences cancel in the matching. While we restrict to the flavor-non-singlet
case, we do take color and spin correlations into account. Interestingly,
quasi-DPDs combines nontrivial features from both the collinear and transverse
momentum dependent quasi-parton distribution functions. This represents a first
step in extending the quasi-PDF approach to DPDs, opening up a new way to
constrain these distributions using lattice QCD.

present here results from a recent XMM-Newton observation of GSN 069, the

absence, QPEs have reappeared in GSN 069, and we detect two consecutive QPEs
separated by a much shorter recurrence time than ever before. Moreover, their

the QPE phenomenology. We study the QPE spectral properties from all XMM-Newton
observations assuming QPEs to either represent an additional emission component
superimposed on that from the disc, or the transient evolution of the disc
emission itself. In the former scenario, QPEs are consistent with black-body
emission from a region that expands by a factor of 2-3 during the individual
QPE evolution with radius of the order of that of the Sun at QPE peak. In the
alternative non-additive scenario, QPEs originate from a region with an area
6-30 times smaller than the quiescent state X-ray emission, with the smallest
regions corresponding to the hottest and most luminous eruptions. The QPE
reappearance reveals that eruptions are only present below a quiescent
luminosity threshold corresponding to an Eddington ratio of the order of 0.4
for a one million solar masses black hole. The disappearance of QPEs above
threshold is most likely driven by the ratio of QPE to quiescence temperatures
approaching unity at high quiescent luminosity, making QPE detection
challenging, if not impossible, above threshold. We briefly discuss some of the
consequences of our results on the proposed models for the QPE physical origin.

feedback, on the 21cm signal by post-processing three existing cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation: Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and
Eagle. Overall and despite their different underlying galaxy-formation models,
the three simulations return similar predictions for the global 21cm rightness
temperature and its power spectrum. At fixed redshift, most differences are
attributable to differences in the history of reionization, in turn driven by
differences in the build-up of stellar sources of radiation. However, the
impact of astrophysics is imprinted in the 21cm power spectrum through several
unique signatures. First, we find significant small scale ($k \geq 10\, \rm
{Mpc}^{-1}$) differences between Illustris and IllustrisTNG, where higher
velocity winds generated by supernova feedback soften density peaks and lead to
lower 21cm power in TNG. Second, we find more 21cm power at intermediate scales
($k \approx 0.8\, \rm {Mpc}^{-1}$) in Eagle, due to differences in ionization
driven by highly effective stellar feedback, leading to lower star formation,
older and redder stellar populations, and thus lower ionizing luminosities.
Though subtle, these features could allow future observations of the 21cm
signal, in conjunction with other reionization observables, to constrain
theoretical models for galactic feedback at high redshift.

in scaling AI algorithms for autonomous driving. Semantic Image Synthesis
(SIS), or label-to-image translation, promises to address this issue by
translating semantic layouts to images, providing a controllable generation of
photorealistic data. However, they require a large amount of paired data,
incurring extra costs. In this work, we present a new task: given a dataset
with synthetic images and labels and a dataset with unlabeled real images, our
goal is to learn a model that can generate images with the content of the input
mask and the appearance of real images. This new task reframes the well-known
unsupervised SIS task in a more practical setting, where we leverage cheaply
available synthetic data from a driving simulator to learn how to generate
photorealistic images of urban scenes. This stands in contrast to previous
works, which assume that labels and images come from the same domain but are
unpaired during training. We find that previous unsupervised works underperform
on this task, as they do not handle distribution shifts between two different
domains. To bypass these problems, we propose a novel framework with two main
contributions. First, we leverage the synthetic image as a guide to the content
of the generated image by penalizing the difference between their high-level
features on a patch level. Second, in contrast to previous works which employ
one discriminator that overfits the target domain semantic distribution, we
employ a discriminator for the whole image and multiscale discriminators on the
image patches. Extensive comparisons on the benchmarks GTA-V $\rightarrow$
Cityscapes and GTA-V $\rightarrow$ Mapillary show the superior performance of
the proposed model against state-of-the-art on this task.

early 2020. The star emerged from this Great Dimming episode with its typical,
roughly 400-day pulsation cycle halved, and a new dominant period of around 200
days. The dimming event has been attributed to a surface mass ejection, in
which rising material drove shocks through the stellar atmosphere and expelled
some material, partially obscuring the star as it formed molecules and dust. In
this paper, we use hydrodynamic simulations to reveal the connections between
Betelgeuse's vigorously convective envelope, the surface mass ejection, and the
pulsation mode switching that ensued. An anomalously hot convective plume,
generated rarely but naturally in the star's turbulent envelope, can rise and
break free from the surface, powering an upwelling that becomes the surface
mass ejection. The rising plume also breaks the phase coherence of the star's
pulsation, causing the surface to keep expanding even as the deeper layers
contract. This drives a switch from the 400-day fundamental mode of pulsation,
in which the whole star expands and contracts synchronously, to the 200-day
first overtone, where a radial node separates the interior and exterior of the
envelope moving in opposite phase. We predict that the star's convective
motions will damp the overtone oscillation and Betelgeuse will return to its
previous, 400-day fundamental mode pulsation in the next 5-10 years. With its
resolved surface and unprecedentedly detailed characterization, Betelgeuse
opens a window to episodic surface mass ejection in the late-stage evolution of
massive stars.

gas depletion parameter $Y_{\rm gas}$ shows a steeper and highly scattered
radial distribution in the central regions of less massive halos with respect
to massive objects at all redshifts, while on larger radii the gas fraction
distributions are independent of the masses or the redshifts. The hot component
of the gas traces well the total amount of gas at low redshifts. At higher
redshifts, the cold component provides a not negligible contribution to the
total amount of baryon in our systems. Moreover, the behaviour of the baryonic,

constraints, but do not match existing self-similar solutions of radiatively
inefficient accretion flows. We develop a theory for this new class of
accretion flows, which we dub simple convective accretion flows (SCAFs). We use
a set of hydrodynamic simulations to provide a minimalistic example of SCAFs,
and develop an analytic theory to explain and predict key flow properties. We
demonstrate that the turbulence in the flow is driven locally by convection,
and argue that radial momentum balance, together with an approximate up-down
symmetry of convective turbulence, yields $\alpha_\rho=-1\pm~{\rm few}~0.1$.
Empirically, for an adiabatic hydrodynamic flow with $\gamma\approx 5/3$, we
get $\alpha_\rho\approx-0.8$; the resulting accretion rate (relative to the
Bondi accretion rate), $\dot M/\dot M_{\rm B}\sim (r_{\rm acc}/r_{\rm

technique that sidesteps the intricacies linked to empirical process theory and
the control of suprema of function classes determined by the cost. Instead, we
perform a careful linearization analysis for entropic optimal transport with
respect to an empirical $L^2$-norm, which enables a streamlined analysis. As a
consequence, our work gives rise to new implications for a multitude of
transport-based applications under general costs, including pointwise
distributional limits for the empirical entropic optimal transport map

Overall, our research lays the foundation for an expanded framework of

symmetry group $G$, the 2D SPT phase protected by $G$ is dual to the 2D
topological phase exemplified by the twisted quantum double model
$D^{\omega}(G)$ via gauging the global symmetry $G$. Recently it was realized
that such a general gauging map can be implemented by some local unitaries and
local measurements when $G$ is a finite, solvable group. Here, we review the
general approach to gauging a $G$-SPT starting from a fixed-point ground-state
wave function and applying a $N$-step gauging procedure. We provide an in-depth
analysis of the intermediate states emerging during the N-step gauging and
provide tools to measure and identify the emerging symmetry-enriched
topological order of these states. We construct the generic lattice parent
Hamiltonians for these intermediate states, and show that they form an
entangled superposition of a twisted quantum double with an SPT ordered state.
Notably, we show that they can be connected to the TQD through a finite-depth,
local quantum circuit which does not respect the global symmetry of the SET
order. We introduce the so-called symmetry branch line operators and show that
they can be used to extract the symmetry fractionalization classes and symmetry
defectification classes of the SET phases with the input data $G$ and

such as the sustainability of geostructures, wellbore stability, evaluation of
land subsidence, CO2 storage, toxic waste containment, and hydraulic
fracturing. One mechanism leading to this time-dependent deformation under a
constant load is the dissolution/formation processes accompanied by
chemo-mechanical interactions with a reactive environment. When
dissolution/formation processes occur within the material phases, the
distribution of stress and strain within the material microstructure changes.
In the case of the dissolution process, the stress carried by the dissolving
phase is distributed into neighboring voxels, which leads to further
deformation of the material. The aim of this study was to explore the
relationship between the microstructural evolution and time-dependent creep
behavior of rocks subjected to chemo-mechanical loading. This work uses the
experimentally characterized microstructural and mechanical evolution of a
shale rock induced by interactions with a reactive brine (CO2-rich brine) and a
non-reactive brine (N2-rich brine) under high-pressure and high-temperature
conditions to compute the resulting time-dependent deformation using a
time-stepping finite-element-based modeling approach. Sample microstructure
snapshots were obtained using segmented micro-CT images of the rock samples
before and after the reactions. Coupled nanoindentation/EDS provided spatial
alteration of the mechanical properties of individual material phases due to
the dissolution and precipitation processes as a result of the chemo-mechanical
loading of the samples. The time-dependent mechanically informed
microstructures were then incorporated into a mechanical model to calculate the
creep behavior caused by the dissolution/precipitation processes independent of
the inherent viscous properties of the mineral phases.

survey of magnetic fluctuations observed by Parker Solar Probe between
20$R_\odot$ and 200$R_\odot$. We find that deviations from spherical
polarization, i.e., changes in $|\mathbf{B}|$ (compressive fluctuations) and
one-dimensional discontinuities, have a dramatic effect on the scaling behavior
of the turbulent fluctuations. We show that shallow $k^{-3/2}$ spectra are only
observed for constant magnetic field strength, three-dimensional structures,
which we identify as large amplitude Alfv\'en waves. The presence of
compressive fluctuations coincides with a steepening of the spectrum up to
$k^{-5/3}$. Steeper power law scalings approaching $k^{-2}$ are observed when
the fluctuations are dominated by discontinuities. Near-sun fluctuations are
found to be the most spherically polarized, suggesting that this spherical
state is fundamental to the generation of the solar wind. With increasing
distance from the Sun, fluctuations are found to become less three dimensional

to one population are uniformly coupled to all oscillators within the same
population and to those in the two neighboring populations. This topology
supports the existence of different configurations of coherent and incoherent
populations along the ring, but all of them are linearly unstable in most of
the parameter space. Yet, chimera dynamics is observed from random initial
conditions in a wide parameter range, characterized by one incoherent and five
synchronized populations. These observable states are connected to the
formation of a heteroclinic cycle between symmetric variants of saddle
chimeras, which gives rise to a switching dynamics. We analyze the dynamical

generalization. We extensively evaluate our regularizer on synthetic datasets

challenge. Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, pre-trained language models have
thus far only enabled modest improvements to the quality of such concept
embeddings. Current strategies for using language models typically represent a
concept by averaging the contextualised representations of its mentions in some
corpus. This is potentially sub-optimal for at least two reasons. First,
contextualised word vectors have an unusual geometry, which hampers downstream
tasks. Second, concept embeddings should capture the semantic properties of
concepts, whereas contextualised word vectors are also affected by other
factors. To address these issues, we propose two contrastive learning
strategies, based on the view that whenever two sentences reveal similar
properties, the corresponding contextualised vectors should also be similar.
One strategy is fully unsupervised, estimating the properties which are
expressed in a sentence from the neighbourhood structure of the contextualised
word embeddings. The second strategy instead relies on a distant supervision
signal from ConceptNet. Our experimental results show that the resulting
vectors substantially outperform existing concept embeddings in predicting the
semantic properties of concepts, with the ConceptNet-based strategy achieving
the best results. These findings are furthermore confirmed in a clustering task

efficient group theoretical methods for calculation of Hamiltonian matrix
elements in multireference configuration interaction calculations and in
quasidegenerate perturbation treatments, such as the GVVPT2 Theory. Moreover,
localized MOs can elucidate qualitative understanding of bonding in molecules,
in addition to high accuracy quantitative descriptions. We adopt the powers of
the fourth moment cost function introduced by J{\o}rgensen and coworkers.
Because the fourth moment cost functions are prone to having multiple negative
Hessian eigenvalues when starting from easily available canonical MOs, standard
optimization algorithms can fail to obtain the orbitals of the virtual or
partially occupied spaces. To overcome this drawback, we applied a Trust Region
algorithm on an orthonormal Riemannian manifold with an approximate retraction
from the tangent space built into first and second derivatives of the cost
function. Moreover, the Riemannian Trust Region outer iterations were coupled
to truncated conjugate gradient inner loops, which avoided any costly solutions

examples are provided on model systems, including the high connectivity H10 set

600 experimentally stable binary semi-conductors with a strong anti-bonding

exhibit ultralow thermal conductivities less than 1 W/(m K) at room temperature

the weakened bonds and increased phonon anharmonicity due to their anti-bonding

storage technologies are increasingly recognized as critical enablers. However,
the macro-energy system assessment of energy storage has often focused on
isolated storage technologies and neglected competition between them, thus
leaving out which energy storage to prioritise. The article applies a
systematic deployment analysis method that enables system-value evaluation in
perfect competitive markets and demonstrates its application to 20 different
energy storage technologies across 40 distinct scenarios for a representative
future power system in Africa. Here, each storage solution is explored alone
and in competition with others, examining specific total system costs,
deployment configuration, and cost synergies between the storage technologies.
The results demonstrate the significant benefits of optimizing energy storage
with competition compared to without (+10% cost savings), and highlight the
relevance of several energy storage technologies in different scenarios. This
work provides insights into the role of energy storage in decarbonizing power
systems and informs future research and policy decisions. There is no
one-size-fits-all energy storage, but rather an ideal combination of multiple

we demonstrate that the different exponents observed in the reference above are

absent in the HS case. By considering a modified horizontal surface (mHS) where
the trails are forbidden of having two consecutive steps along it, resembling
the DS situation, a stable SAG phase is found in the phase diagram, and both DS

$1/\delta^{(s)} \approx 0.44$, whilst $1/\delta^{(s)} \approx 0.34$ in the HS

Floquet theory. The effective optical properties of this driven system are
probed through a weak laser whose effects are captured to first order in
perturbation theory. The resulting formula for non-equilibrium optical
absorption is akin to the regular near-equilibrium absorption theory but with
the Floquet-Bloch modes playing the role of pristine eigenstates of matter. To
exemplify the effect of laser-dressing in the optical absorption, we perform
computations of a model solid with a cosine-shaped lattice potential. We
identify dramatic changes in the optical absorption upon increasing the
amplitude of the driving laser. The spectrum shows a blue-shift of the band
edge and below band gap absorption that agree with the dynamical Franz-Keldysh
effect. It also shows several replicas of transitions separated by integer
multiples of the drive photon energy that we assign as purely-optical tell-tale

effect, strikingly we also observe intense low-frequency absorption and
stimulated emissions and the opening of dips in the absorption spectrum that
emerge due to the hybridization of the Floquet-Bloch modes which are novel

entanglement of formation serves as a basis of comparison between different

tripartite entanglement is doubly challenging because it is not enough to show
that each party is inseparable from the other two (which is sufficient only for
pure states). Instead, one must rule out all mixtures of all combinations of
biseparable states from describing the tripartite state. To meet this
challenge, we use entropic measures of the statistics of tripartite systems to
simultaneously bound the correlations each party has with the other two, and in
so doing place a lower limit to the tripartite entanglement of formation. Even
though our measure never over-estimates the entanglement present, we estimate
the effectiveness of our technique by determining the exact tripartite
entanglement of a triple-gaussian triphoton wavefunction with the same
correlations as seen in photon triplets generated in third-order spontaneous

inadequate. It does not prevent data misusage while at the same time stifling
sensible use cases for data.
  We think the conflict between data protection and increasingly data-driven

given, all usages should be made transparent to them, according to the concept
of inverse transparency. This allows individuals to benefit from sensible data
usage while addressing the potentially harmful consequences of data misusage.
To accomplish this, we propose a new design approach for workforce analytics we
refer to as inverse transparency by design.
  To understand the developer and user perspectives on the proposal, we conduct
two exploratory studies with students. First, we let small teams of developers
implement analytics tools with inverse transparency by design to uncover how
they judge the approach and how it materializes in their developed tools. We
find that architectural changes are made without inhibiting core functionality.
The developers consider our approach valuable and technically feasible. Second,
we conduct a user study over three months to let participants experience the
provided inverse transparency and reflect on their experience. The study models
a software development workplace where most work processes are already digital.
Participants perceive the transparency as beneficial and feel empowered by it.
They unanimously agree that it would be an improvement for the workplace. We

injecting copious amounts of electromagnetic energy into the background over a
broad range of frequencies. We study this injection both analytically, as well
as numerically using the thermalization code CosmoTherm. With our refined
analytic formalism, we update constraints from CMB spectral distortions by
following the injection of entropy, as well as energy, on the amplitude of the
$\mu$-distortion, leading to a significant improvement in those limits.
Furthermore, we utilize the full shape of the distorted spectrum from
CosmoTherm to include constraints from non-$\mu$, non-$y$ type distortions.
Additionally, we use the outputs for the ionization history and global 21cm
signal to derive and update constraints on string model parameters using
measurements from other datasets. Analysis of CMB anisotropies provides the
most stringent constraints, though with a slightly modified shape and strength
when compared to previous results. Modifications of the reionization history
provide new bounds in the high current domain, and we also find that the
observations of the low-frequency radio background probe a small region of
parameter space not explored by other datasets. We also analyze global $21$-cm
constraints, and find that the inclusion of soft photon heating plays a crucial
role, essentially removing any constraints in the considered parameter domain.
Spectral distortion measurements from COBE/FIRAS are covered by other
constraints, but our conservative forecast shows that a PIXIE-type satellite
would probe important unexplored regions of parameter space.

the result of the distribution of images of people in the training set, making
it challenging to generate multiple images for a fixed number of individuals.
This problem can often only be solved by fine-tuning the training of the model.
This means that each individual/animated character image must be trained if it
is to be drawn, and the hardware and cost of this training is often beyond the
reach of the average user, who accounts for the largest number of people. To
solve this problem, the Character Image Feature Encoder model proposed in this
paper enables the user to use the process by simply providing a picture of the
character to make the image of the character in the generated image match the
expectation. In addition, various details can be adjusted during the process
using prompts. Unlike traditional Image-to-Image models, the Character Image
Feature Encoder extracts only the relevant image features, rather than
information about the model's composition or movements. In addition, the
Character Image Feature Encoder can be adapted to different models after
training. The proposed model can be conveniently incorporated into the Stable
Diffusion generation process without modifying the model's ontology or used in
combination with Stable Diffusion as a joint model.

example, predict the risk of a code change are well established. However, as
the goals of a project shift over time, and developers and their habits change,
the performance of said models tends to degrade (drift) over time, until a
model is retrained using new data. Current retraining practices typically are
an afterthought (and hence costly), requiring a new model to be retrained from
scratch on a large, updated data set at random points in time; also, there is
no continuity between the old and new model. In this paper, we propose to use
lifelong learning (LL) to continuously build and maintain ML-based software
analytics tools using an incremental learner that progressively updates the old
model using new data. To avoid so-called ''catastrophic forgetting'' of
important older data points, we adopt a replay buffer of older data, which
still allows us to drastically reduce the size of the overall training data
set, and hence model training time. We empirically evaluate our LL approach on
two industrial use cases, i.e., a brown build detector and a Just-in-Time risk
prediction tool, showing how LL in practice manages to at least match
traditional retraining-from-scratch performance in terms of F1-score, while
using 3.3-13.7x less data at each update, thus considerably speeding up the
model updating process. Considering both the computational effort of updates
and the time between model updates, the LL setup needs 2-40x less computational
effort than retraining-from-scratch setups.

suppressed more strongly on non-linear scales than assumed in state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we investigate cosmic shear data
from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3. The non-linear suppression of the
matter power spectrum required to resolve the $S_8$ tension between DES and the
$\textit{Planck}\ \Lambda\rm{CDM}$ model is not as strong as inferred using
KiDS data, but is still more extreme than predictions from recent numerical
simulations. An alternative possibility is that non-standard dark matter
contributes to the required suppression. We investigate the redshift and scale
dependence of the suppression of the matter power spectrum. If our proposed
explanation of the $S_8$ tension is correct, the required suppression must
extend into the mildly non-linear regime to wavenumbers $k\sim 0.2 h {\rm

with the $\textit{Planck}\ \Lambda\rm{CDM}$ cosmology, an expectation that will
be testable to high precision in the near future.

qualitatively the same structural features as the nucleon axial, induced
pseudoscalar, and pion-nucleon coupling form factors. For instance, the
$\Delta$-baryon $g_1$ axial form factor can reliably be approximated by a
dipole function, characterised by an axial charge $g_A^{\Delta^+}=0.71(9)$ and
mass-scale $m_A^\Delta=0.95(2)m_\Delta$. Moreover, the two distinct
$\Delta$-baryon PCAC form factor relations are satisfied to a high degree of

than keep piling up silicon resources. The Tiny Triplet Finder is a scheme that
reduces the computing complexity of the segment seeding. As a proof of concept,
a 3D track segment seeding engine core based on the Tiny Triplet Finder has
been implemented and tested in a low-cost FPGA device. The seeding engine is
designed to preselect and group hits (stubs) from detector layers to feed
subsequent track fitting stage. The seeding engine consists of a Hough

implement 3D constraints. The seeding engine is organized as a pipeline so that
each hit is processed in a single clock cycle. Taking advantage of the
register-like storage block scheme which enables effectively resetting of a
block RAM within a single clock cycle, clearing or refreshing the seeding
engine takes only one clock cycles between two events. The Tiny Triplet Finder

provide a powerful and flexible framework for deriving principled learning
rules for arbitrary stochastic neural networks. The coagent framework offers an
alternative to backpropagation-based deep learning (BDL) that overcomes some of
backpropagation's main limitations. For example, coagent networks can compute
different parts of the network \emph{asynchronously} (at different rates or at
different times), can incorporate non-differentiable components that cannot be
used with backpropagation, and can explore at levels higher than their action
spaces (that is, they can be designed as hierarchical networks for exploration
and/or temporal abstraction). However, the coagent framework is not just an
alternative to BDL; the two approaches can be blended: BDL can be combined with
coagent learning rules to create architectures with the advantages of both
approaches. This work generalizes the coagent theory and learning rules
provided by previous works; this generalization provides more flexibility for
network architecture design within the coagent framework. This work also
studies one of the chief disadvantages of coagent networks: high variance
updates for networks that have many coagents and do not use backpropagation. We
show that a coagent algorithm with a policy network that does not use
backpropagation can scale to a challenging RL domain with a high-dimensional

multifractality enhances the underlying roughness, and so should be the
spontaneous stochasticity. This letter exhibits a case with a lesser intuitive

specifically address Lagrangian transport in uni-dimensional multifractal
random flows, obtained by decorating rough Markovian monofractal Gaussian
fields with frozen-in-time Gaussian multiplicative chaos. Combining systematic

that the generalized Komar integral is not conserved at the first non-trivial

shown to be identical to the ADM energy not only at this order but also all

to be a total number of particles. We call it a gravitational charge, since it
is clearly different from the total energy. We finally discuss an implication

wicking structures to achieve high solar-to-vapor efficiency by minimizing heat
loss. However, wicking structures cannot reject salt continuously which limits
the operating duration of the desalinators to several hours before the devices
are turned off to reject salt. While significant research has focused on
developing efficient evaporators to achieve high solar-to-vapor efficiency,
inefficient condensers have become the bottleneck for the overall
solar-to-water efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we designed a passive
inverted single stage solar membrane desalinator that achieves continuous
desalination and salt rejection. By flowing salt water on a radiative
absorbing, porous, hydrophobic evaporator membrane using gravity, salt
continuously diffuses away from the membrane while allowing heated water vapor
to transport to and condense on a cooler microporous membrane below. Our design
utilizes thin-film condensation on a microporous membrane which offers ample
three-phase contact region to enhance condensation phase change heat transfer.
By condensing within the microporous membrane, we reduce the gap distance
between the condenser and evaporator membranes, which reduces the vapor
transport resistance. We experimentally demonstrated a record-high continuous
desalination and salt rejection test duration of 7 days under one-sun. Despite
an increased convection heat loss necessary for salt rejection on the
evaporator, our desalinator still achieved a water-collection rate of 0.487
$kg$ $m^{-2}h^{-1}$, which corresponds to a 32.2% solar-to-water efficiency.
This work signifies an improvement in the robustness of current state of the

building effective writing assistants. With the prior success of LLMs and
instruction tuning, we leverage instruction-tuned LLMs for text revision to
improve the quality of user-generated text and improve the efficiency of the
process. We introduce CoEdIT, a state-of-the-art text editing model for writing
assistance. CoEdIT takes instructions from the user specifying the attributes
of the desired text, such as ""Make the sentence simpler"" or ""Write it in a more
neutral style,"" and outputs the edited text. We present a large language model
fine-tuned on a diverse collection of task-specific instructions for text
editing (a total of 82K instructions). Our model (1) achieves state-of-the-art
performance on various text editing benchmarks, (2) is competitive with
publicly available largest-sized LLMs trained on instructions while being
$\sim$60x smaller, (3) is capable of generalizing to unseen edit instructions,
and (4) exhibits compositional comprehension abilities to generalize to
instructions containing different combinations of edit actions. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show that writers prefer
the edits suggested by CoEdIT, relative to other state-of-the-art text editing
models. Our code and dataset are publicly available.

convincing utterances very similar to those written by humans, distinguishing
whether a piece of text is machine-generated or human-written becomes more
challenging and more important, as such models could be used to spread
misinformation, fake news, fake reviews and to mimic certain authors and

optimal under the likelihood function of the generator, while human-written
text is not. We find that overall, smaller and partially-trained models are
better universal text detectors: they can more precisely detect text generated

First, we evaluate SASC on synthetic modules and find that it often recovers

Finally, we show that SASC can generate explanations for the response of

to the acquisition of unbiased models, whilst deepening the understanding of
complex systems and phenomena. However, when we consider situations in which
the model elements are not directly observable, such as when noise or ocular
occlusion is present, possibilities arise for which standard maximum entropy
approaches may fail, as they are unable to match feature constraints. Here we
show the Principle of Uncertain Maximum Entropy as a method that both encodes
all available information in spite of arbitrarily noisy observations while
surpassing the accuracy of some ad-hoc methods. Additionally, we utilize the
output of a black-box machine learning model as input into an uncertain maximum
entropy model, resulting in a novel approach for scenarios where the
observation function is unavailable. Previous remedies either relaxed feature
constraints when accounting for observation error, given well-characterized
errors such as zero-mean Gaussian, or chose to simply select the most likely

applications in diverse fields due to generalizing the traditional maximum

investigate the trend and potential risk of the EP in Northeast China(107
stations) during 1959-2017, especially in early and later summer. For the first
time, the non-stationary generalized extreme value (GEV) model is used to
analyze the trend and potential risk of EP in Northeast China. Moreover, the
mechanisms of EP trends over Northeast China in early and later summer were
studied separately. Negative trends dominate EP in early summer but positive
trends prevail in last summer. It is reasonable to discuss separately in the
two periods. Meanwhile, all return levels are shown to increase trends in EP in
early summer, corresponding to more frequent EP events. Nevertheless, in later
summer, the 2-year return level decreases in location parameter diminish
slightly, and the rare EP (20, 50, and 100-year return levels) slightly
increase with scale parameter. Also, our results show that normal EP frequently
occurs in Liaoning Province, and extreme EP is more likely to occur in Jilin
Province and Heilongjiang Province. The increase of EP in early summer is
mainly influenced by the northeast cold vortex. However, in later summer, the
effect of cold air on EP is stronger in Northeast China, which gives a clear
explanation that the EP does not increase. This study analyzed the trends and
mechanism of return level and EP, which is beneficial for the development of

cosmic microwave background (CMB) resulting from inverse Compton scattering of
CMB photons with electrons in the medium of galaxy clusters. The spectrum of
the tSZ effect is typically calculated assuming the spectrum of the CMB is a
blackbody. However, energy or photon number injection at any epoch after photon
creation processes become inefficient will distort the blackbody, potentially
leading to a chemical potential or $\mu$-distortion for early injection. These
$primordial$ spectral distortions will therefore introduce a change in the tSZ
effect, effectively a distortion of a distortion. While this effect is small
for an individual cluster's spectrum, upcoming and proposed CMB surveys expect
to detect tens of thousands of clusters with the tSZ effect. In this paper, we
forecast constraints on the $\mu$-distortion monopole from the distortion of
the tSZ spectrum of clusters measured by CMB surveys. We find that planned

  Conference",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Upper extremity motor impairment affects about 80\% of persons after strokes.
For stroke rehabilitation, upper limb kinematic assessments have increasingly
been used as primary or secondary outcome measures. Studying the upper
extremity provides a valuable tool for assessing limb coordination,
mal-adaptations, and recovery. There is currently no universal standardized
scale for categorizing multi-joint upper extremity movement. We propose a
modified Procrustes statistical shape method as a quantitative analysis that
can recognize segments of movement where multiple limb segments are
coordinating movement. Generalized Procrustes methods allow data points to be
compared across an array simultaneously rather than comparing them in pairs.
Rather than rely solely on discrete kinematic values to contrast movement, this
method allows evaluation of how movement progresses. The Procrustes analysis of
able-bodied movement showed that the hand and forearm segments moved in a more
coordinated manner during initiation. The shoulder and elbow become more
coordinated during movement completion. In impaired movement, this coordination
between the hand and forearm is disrupted. Potentially mal-adaptive
compensation occurs between the upper arm and forearm after movement enters the
deceleration phase. The utilization of Procrustes analysis may be a step
towards developing a comprehensive and universal quantitative tool that does
not require changes to existing treatments or increase patient burden.

and e-commerce networks) that exceed the storage and computational capacity of
a single machine. To reach performance comparable to centralized training,
distributed frameworks focus on maximally recovering cross-instance node
dependencies with either communication across instances or periodic fallback to
centralized training, which create overhead and limit the framework
scalability. In this work, we present a simplified framework for distributed
GNN training that does not rely on the aforementioned costly operations, and
has improved scalability, convergence speed and performance over the
state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our framework (1) assembles
independent trainers, each of which asynchronously learns a local model on
locally-available parts of the training graph, and (2) only conducts periodic
(time-based) model aggregation to synchronize the local models. Backed by our
theoretical analysis, instead of maximizing the recovery of cross-instance node
dependencies -- which has been considered the key behind closing the
performance gap between model aggregation and centralized training -- , our
framework leverages randomized assignment of nodes or super-nodes (i.e.,
collections of original nodes) to partition the training graph such that it
improves data uniformity and minimizes the discrepancy of gradient and loss
function across instances. In our experiments on social and e-commerce networks
with up to 1.3 billion edges, our proposed RandomTMA and SuperTMA approaches --
despite using less training data -- achieve state-of-the-art performance and
2.31x speedup compared to the fastest baseline, and show better robustness to
trainer failures.

density threshold, and core volume fraction are found for galaxy density
fields. We achieve about $60$--$67\%$ of completeness and reliability for
identifying the voids of corresponding cluster mass above
$3\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ from a galaxy sample with the mean number
density, $\bar{n}=4.4\times10^{-3} (h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^{-3}$. When the mean

rates and negative effects on their reproductive health. Therefore, the stances
of the abortion-related Facebook posts were analyzed at the state level in the
United States from May 4 until June 30, 2022, right after the Supreme Court's

architecture-based model was fine-tuned on a manually labeled training set to
obtain a stance detection model suitable for the collected dataset. Afterward,
we employed appropriate statistical tests to examine the relationships between
public opinion regarding abortion, abortion legality, political leaning, and
factors measuring the overall population's health, health knowledge, and
vulnerability per state. We found that states with a higher number of views
against abortion also have higher infant and maternal mortality rates.
Furthermore, the stance of social media posts per state is mostly matching with
the current abortion laws in these states. While aligned with existing
literature, these findings indicate how public opinion, laws, and women's and
infants' health are related, and interventions are required to educate and
protect women, especially in vulnerable populations.

tensor renormalization group (lTRG) for the 2D classical Ising model near the
critical temperature. Utilizing two different methods, we extract operator
scaling dimensions and operator-product-expansion (OPE) coefficients by
introducing defects on the lattice and by employing the fixed-point tensor. We
also explore the effects of point-like defects in the lattice on the
coarse-graining process. We find that there is a correspondence between
coarse-grained defect tensors and conformal states obtained from lTRG
fixed-point equation. We also analyze the capabilities and limitations of our
proposed coarse-graining scheme for tensor networks with point-like defects,
which includes graph independent local truncation (GILT) and higher-order
tensor renormalization group (HOTRG). Our results provide a better
understanding of the capacity and limitations of the tenor renormalization
group scheme in coarse-graining defect tensors, and we show that GILT+HOTRG can
be used to give accurate two- and four-point functions under specific
conditions. We also find that employing the minimal canonical form further
improves the stability of the RG flow.

models on diverse downstream tasks even with limited data. Recent works of
\cite{basu2022equi} and \cite{kaba2022equivariance} propose group averaging
(\textit{equitune}) and optimization-based methods, respectively, over features
from group-transformed inputs to obtain equivariant outputs from
non-equivariant neural networks. While \cite{kaba2022equivariance} are only
concerned with training from scratch, we find that equitune performs poorly on
equivariant zero-shot tasks despite good finetuning results. We hypothesize
that this is because pretrained models provide better quality features for
certain transformations than others and simply averaging them is deleterious.
Hence, we propose $\lambda$-\textit{equitune} that averages the features using
\textit{importance weights}, $\lambda$s. These weights are learned directly
from the data using a small neural network, leading to excellent zero-shot and
finetuned results that outperform equitune. Further, we prove that
$\lambda$-equitune is equivariant and a universal approximator of equivariant
functions. Additionally, we show that the method of \cite{kaba2022equivariance}
used with appropriate loss functions, which we call \textit{equizero}, also
gives excellent zero-shot and finetuned performance. Both equitune and equizero
are special cases of $\lambda$-equitune. To show the simplicity and generality
of our method, we validate on a wide range of diverse applications and models
such as 1) image classification using CLIP, 2) deep Q-learning, 3) fairness in
natural language generation (NLG), 4) compositional generalization in
languages, and 5) image classification using pretrained CNNs such as Resnet and

applications from real-time motion planning and control in robotics, to
reachability analysis of nonlinear systems and safety shielding in
reinforcement learning. Despite this widespread use, a frequently overlooked
difficulty associated with polynomial zonotopes is intersection checking.
Determining whether the reachable set, represented as a polynomial zonotope,
intersects an unsafe set is not straightforward. In fact, we show that this
fundamental operation is NP-hard, even for a simple class of polynomial
zonotopes. The standard method for intersection checking with polynomial
zonotopes is a two-part algorithm that overapproximates a polynomial zonotope
with a regular zonotope and then, if the overapproximation error is deemed too
large, splits the set and recursively tries again. Beyond the possible need for
a large number of splits, we identify two sources of concern related to this
algorithm: (1) overapproximating a polynomial zonotope with a zonotope has
unbounded error, and (2) after splitting a polynomial zonotope, the
overapproximation error can actually increase. Taken together, this implies
there may be a possibility that the algorithm does not always terminate.We
perform a rigorous analysis of the method and detail necessary conditions for
the union of overapproximations to provably converge to the original polynomial
zonotope.

the assumption of (strong) convexity of the loss function. It remains an
important open problem to further relax this condition while proving similar

clipping to limit the impact of individual samples on the training process. Our
findings demonstrate that the privacy loss of projected DP-SGD converges
exponentially fast, without requiring convexity or smoothness assumptions on

hockey-stick divergence between coupled stochastic processes by relying on

we investigate the effects of overfitting on the robustness of gradient-descent

uncertainty arises naturally if the gradient is estimated from noisy data or

from the prover to the verifier in the last authentication phase. This paper
presents two new QDB protocols that differ from previously proposed protocols
in several aspects: (1) to the best of our knowledge, our protocols are the
first to utilize entangled qubits in the rapid-bit exchange phase, previous
protocols relied on sending individual qubits, not those from a pair of
entangled ones; (2) our second protocol can perform mutual QDB between two

the prover and verifier roles reversed in each execution; (3) the use of
entangled qubits in our protocols thwarts attacks that previous QDB protocols
were prone to; (4) and finally, our protocols also eliminate the need for

class of Gaussian processes, called seasonal Gaussian Processes (sGP), for
model-based inference of such quasi-periodic behavior. We illustrate that the
exact sGP can be efficiently fit within $O(n)$ time using its state space
representation for equally spaced locations. However, for large datasets with
irregular spacing, the exact approach becomes computationally inefficient and
unstable. To address this, we develop a continuous finite dimensional

model. Correct nucleon density (ND) must reproduce experimental nuclear charge
density (NCD). We consider several versions of NDs available in the literature
and construct our own approximation for the ND of even-even spherical nuclei
12C, 16O, 40Ca which is abbreviated as FE-density (Fermi+exponential). We
carefully compare the NCDs resulting from different versions of NDs with the
experimental NCSs. After finding the nucleus-nucleus potential using the
double-folding model with the density dependent M3Y-Paris NN-forces and FE
densities we evaluate the above-barrier fusion cross sections for five
reactions, 12C+12C, 12C+16O, 16O+16O, 16O+40Ca, and 40Ca+40Ca, where the
experimental data are available. The cross sections are calculated using two
approaches: a) the barrier penetration model and b) the Trajectory Model with
surface friction (TM). To find the transmission coefficients for TM, the
Langevin equations are employed. For all considered reactions, our TM typically
reproduces the above-barrier experimental cross sections within 10-15%. The
only adjustable parameter of the model, the optimal friction strength K_Rm, was
found to be about 90 zs/GeV for light reactions 12C+12C, 12C+16O, 16O+16O and
about 15 zs/GeV for heavier reactions 16O+40Ca and 40Ca+40Ca. The latter
findings are in reasonable agreement with the systematics found earlier. Thus,
the FE-recipe allows reproducing simultaneously with good accuracy both the
charge nucleon density and the above-barrier fusion cross sections for five
reactions involving 12C, 16O, 40Ca nuclei.

feedback for optimizing learning-to-rank systems. Among existing solutions,
automatic ULTR algorithms that jointly learn user bias models (i.e., propensity
models) with unbiased rankers have received a lot of attention due to their
superior performance and low deployment cost in practice. Despite their
theoretical soundness, the effectiveness is usually justified under a weak
logging policy, where the ranking model can barely rank documents according to
their relevance to the query. However, when the logging policy is strong, e.g.,
an industry-deployed ranking policy, the reported effectiveness cannot be
reproduced. In this paper, we first investigate ULTR from a causal perspective
and uncover a negative result: existing ULTR algorithms fail to address the
issue of propensity overestimation caused by the query-document relevance
confounder. Then, we propose a new learning objective based on backdoor
adjustment and highlight its differences from conventional propensity models,
which reveal the prevalence of propensity overestimation. On top of that, we
introduce a novel propensity model called Logging-Policy-aware Propensity (LPP)
model and its distinctive two-step optimization strategy, which allows for the
joint learning of LPP and ranking models within the automatic ULTR framework,
and actualize the unconfounded propensity estimation for ULTR. Extensive
experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method.

of this finding, here we derive a condition such that sustained and unimpeded
SE accretion could be achieved in optically thick slim accretion disks
surrounding neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs). For this, we calculate a
semi-analytic approximation of the self-similar global radial velocity
expression for an advection-dominated flow. Neglecting the influence of
relativistic jets on the accretion flow, we find that for Eddington fraction
$\dot{m} \gtrsim 1.5 (\epsilon/0.1)^{3/5}$ ($\epsilon$ being the accretion
efficiency) sustained SE accretion might be possible in slim disks around BHs
irrespective of their spin. The same condition holds for NSs when $\epsilon >
0.03$. The presence of a surface magnetic field might truncate the disk at the
magnetosphere of the NS, resulting in lower efficiencies and consequently
changing the condition to $\dot{m} > 0.013 \epsilon^{-19/31}$. Our approach
suggests that sustained SE accretion might almost always be possible around NSs

and seismology of Saturn's rings suggest that the primordial composition
gradients in the deep interior of these planets have persisted since their
formation. One possible explanation is the presence of a double-diffusive
staircase below the planet's outer convection zone, which inhibits mixing
across the deeper layers. However, hydrodynamic simulations have shown that
these staircases are not long-lasting and can be disrupted by overshooting
convection. In this paper we suggests that planetary rotation could be another
factor for the longevity of primordial composition gradients. Using rotational
mixing-length theory and 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that
rotation significantly reduces both the convective velocity and the mixing of
primordial composition gradients. In particular, for Jovian conditions at
$t\sim10^{8}~\mathrm{yrs}$ after formation, rotation reduces the convective
velocity by a factor of 6, and in turn, the kinetic energy flux available for
mixing gets reduced by a factor of $6^3\sim 200$. This leads to an entrainment
timescale that is more than two orders of magnitude longer than without
rotation. We encourage future hydrodynamic models of Jupiter and other gas
giants to include rapid rotation, because the decrease in the mixing efficiency
could explain why Jupiter and Saturn are not fully mixed.

conservatively transform the chance constraints to deterministic forms by using
the Bernstein-type inequality and the conditional value-at-risk for the

approximate them as convex semidefinite programs. Finally, simulation results

the length of the input sequence. To address this, several efficient variants
of Transformers have been proposed to accelerate computation or reduce memory
consumption while preserving performance. This paper presents an efficient
vision Transformer, called CageViT, that is guided by convolutional activation
to reduce computation. Our CageViT, unlike current Transformers, utilizes a new
encoder to handle the rearranged tokens, bringing several technical
contributions: 1) Convolutional activation is used to pre-process the token
after patchifying the image to select and rearrange the major tokens and minor
tokens, which substantially reduces the computation cost through an additional
fusion layer. 2) Instead of using the class activation map of the convolutional
model directly, we design a new weighted class activation to lower the model
requirements. 3) To facilitate communication between major tokens and fusion
tokens, Gated Linear SRA is proposed to further integrate fusion tokens into
the attention mechanism. We perform a comprehensive validation of CageViT on
the image classification challenge.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CageViT outperforms the
most recent state-of-the-art backbones by a large margin in terms of
efficiency, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy (e.g. a

Yet, scalable, easy to read tree layouts are difficult to achieve. We consider
tree layouts to be readable if they meet some basic requirements: node labels
should not overlap, edges should not cross, edge lengths should be preserved,
and the output should be compact. There are many algorithms for drawing trees,
although very few take node labels or edge lengths into account, and none
optimizes all requirements above. With this in mind, we propose a new scalable
method for readable tree layouts. The algorithm guarantees that the layout has
no edge crossings and no label overlaps, and optimizes one of the remaining
aspects: desired edge lengths and compactness. We evaluate the performance of
the new algorithm by comparison with related earlier approaches using several
real-world datasets, ranging from a few thousand nodes to hundreds of thousands

by extracting a hierarchy of progressively larger trees. We illustrate this

must first undergo a rigorous assessment of driving quality. These quality
evaluations typically focus on estimating the frequency of (undesirable)
behavioral events. While rate estimation would be straight-forward with
complete data, in the autonomous driving setting this estimation is greatly
complicated by the fact that \textit{detecting} these events within large
driving logs is a non-trivial task that often involves human reviewers. In this
paper we outline a \textit{streaming partial tiered event review} configuration
that ensures both high recall and high precision on the events of interest. In
addition, the framework allows for valid streaming estimates at any phase of
the data collection process, even when labels are incomplete, for which we
develop the maximum likelihood estimate and show it is unbiased. Constructing
honest and effective confidence intervals (CI) for these rate estimates,
particularly for rare safety-critical events, is a novel and challenging
statistical problem due to the complexity of the data likelihood. We develop
and compare several CI approximations, including a novel Gamma CI method that
approximates the exact but intractable distribution with a weighted sum of
independent Poisson random variables. There is a clear trade-off between
statistical coverage and interval width across the different CI methods, and
the extent of this trade-off varies depending on the specific application
settings (e.g., rare vs. common events). In particular, we argue that our
proposed CI method is the best-suited when estimating the rate of
safety-critical events where guaranteed coverage of the true parameter value is
a prerequisite to safely launching a new ADS on public roads.

hierarchical task grouping module that allows label-limited classes to benefit

promising performance by jointly performing tumor segmentation with survival
prediction, where the models were guided to extract tumor-related information
through Multi-Task Learning (MTL). However, existing deep survival models have
difficulties in exploring out-of-tumor prognostic information (e.g., local
lymph node metastasis and adjacent tissue invasions). In addition, existing
deep survival models are underdeveloped in utilizing multi-modality images.
Empirically-designed strategies were commonly adopted to fuse multi-modality
information via fixed pre-designed networks. In this study, we propose a Deep
Multi-modality Segmentation-to-Survival model (DeepMSS) for survival prediction
from PET/CT images. Instead of adopting MTL, we propose a novel
Segmentation-to-Survival Learning (SSL) strategy, where our DeepMSS is trained
for tumor segmentation and survival prediction sequentially. This strategy
enables the DeepMSS to initially focus on tumor regions and gradually expand
its focus to include other prognosis-related regions. We also propose a

automatic optimization of fusion strategies based on training data during
training and also improves the adaptability of DeepMSS to different training
targets. Our DeepMSS is also capable of incorporating conventional radiomics
features as an enhancement, where handcrafted features can be extracted from

emission properties of optoelectronic materials because CL is free from
excitable bandgap limits and from ambiguous signals due to simple light
scattering and resonant Raman scattering potentially involved in the
photoluminescence (PL) spectra. However, direct CL measurements of atomically
thin two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and
hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), have been difficult due to the small excitation
volume that interacts with high-energy electron beams (e-beams). Herein,
distinct CL signals from a monolayer hBN, namely mBN, epitaxial film grown on a
highly oriented pyrolytic graphite substrate are shown by using a home-made CL
system capable of large-area and surface-sensitive excitation by an e-beam. The
spatially resolved CL spectra at 13 K exhibited a predominant 5.5-eV emission
band, which has been ascribed to originate from multilayered aggregates of hBN,
markedly at thicker areas formed on the step edges of the substrate.
Conversely, a faint peak at 6.04 eV was routinely observed from atomically flat
areas. Since the energy agreed with the PL peak of 6.05 eV at 10 K that has
been assigned as being due to the recombination of phonon-assisted direct
excitons of mBN by Elias et al. [Nat. Commun. 10, 2639 (2019)], the CL peak at
6.04 eV is attributed to originate from the mBN epilayer. The CL results
support the transition from indirect bandgap in bulk hBN to direct bandgap in
mBN, in analogy with molybdenum disulfide. The results also encourage to
elucidate emission properties of other low-dimensional materials with reduced
excitation volumes by using the present CL configuration.

address the joint user activity detection (UAD) and channel estimation (CE)

Specifically, the delay profile is exploited at the receiver to distinguish
different UEs. However, a sample correlation problem in this receiver design
impedes the factorization of the joint likelihood function, which complicates
the UAD and CE problem. To address this correlation problem, we design a
partially uni-directional (PUD) factor graph representation for the joint

PUD message passing based sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) algorithm for
asynchronous UAD and CE (PUDMP-SBL-aUADCE). Our theoretical analysis shows that
the PUDMP-SBL-aUADCE algorithm exhibits higher signal-to-interference-and-noise

proposed receiver design can exploit asynchronization to suppress multi-user

between small quantum droplet scattering and large quantum droplet scattering.
The scattering of small quantum droplets is similar to that of solitons, where
a spatially symmetric trapped mode is formed at the critical speed, whereas for
large quantum droplets a spatially asymmetric trapped mode is formed.
Additionally, a nonmonotonous dependence of the critical speed on the atom
number is identified$:$ on the small-droplet side, the critical speed increases
with the atom number, while in the flat-top regime, the critical speed
decreases with increasing the atom number. Strikingly, the scattering excites
internal modes below the particle-emission threshold, preventing the quantum
droplets from emitting radiation upon interaction with the potential. Analysis
of the small-amplitude excitation spectrum shows that as the number of
particles increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to emit particles
outside the droplet during scattering, while radiation from solitons cannot be
completely avoided. Finally, we study the collision of two quantum droplets at

in order to maximize the spread of influence or information on a network. This
task is typically studied on static or temporal networks where the complete

selected before observing the future evolution of the network. In this work, we
consider this realistic ex ante setting where $p$ time steps of the network

calculated after the network continues to evolve for a total of $T>p$ time

factorization and graph neural networks link prediction algorithms to predict
the future evolution of the network and then apply existing influence
maximization algorithms on the predicted networks. Additionally, the output of
the link prediction methods can be used to construct novel IM algorithms. We
apply the proposed methods to many real-world networks to compare their

provides results comparable to the results treating the future graph snapshots

some of the best-performing methods. These findings indicate that, for these

flows with rms Mach numbers $\mathcal{M} \approx 0.2, 1.1$ and $3$, we show
that magnetic pressure forces play a crucial role in dynamo saturation in
supersonic flows. Firstly, as expected when pressure forces oppose compression,
an increase in anti-correlation between density and magnetic field strengths
obtains even in subsonic flows with the anti-correlation arising from the
intense but rarer magnetic structures. In supersonic flows, due to stronger
compressive motions density and magnetic field strength continue to maintain a
positive correlation. However, the degree of positive correlation decreases as
the dynamo saturates. Secondly, we find that the unit vectors of $\nabla\rho$
and $\nabla B^{2}$ are preferentially anti-parallel to each other in subsonic
flows. This is indicative of magnetic pressure opposing compression. This
anti-parallel alignment persists in transonic and supersonic flows at dynamo
saturation. However, compressive motions also lead to the emergence of a
parallel alignment in these flows. Finally, we consider the work done against
the components of the Lorentz force and the different sources of magnetic
energy growth and dissipation. We show that while in subsonic flows,
suppression of field line stretching is dominant in saturating the dynamo, the
picture is different in supersonic flows. Both field line stretching and
compression amplifies the field initially. But the growing magnetic pressure

super-Eddington accretion flows in an optically thick, advection-dominated
regime, motivated by tidal disruption events wherein super-Eddington accretion
assumes a pivotal role. Our model takes into account the loss of angular
momentum due to radiation and the scale-height derivative in the basic
equations of the GR slim disk. For comparison purposes, we also provide a new
analytical solution for a radiation-pressure-dominant GR slim disk, which
neglects the angular momentum loss due to radiation and the scale-height
derivative. We find that the radiation pressure enhances by incorporating the
scale height derivative into the basic equations. As a result, the surface
density near the disk's inner edge decreases, whereas the disk temperature and
scale height increase, brightening the disk spectrum in the soft X-ray
waveband. Notably, an extremely high mass accretion rate significantly enhances
the effect of the scale-height derivative, affecting the entire disk. In
contrast, the inclusion of the radiation-driven angular momentum loss only
slightly influences the disk surface density and temperature compared with the
case of the scale-height derivative inclusion. The X-ray luminosity increases
significantly due to scale height derivative for $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}
\gtrsim 2$. In addition, the increment is higher for the non-spinning black
hole than the spinning black hole case, resulting in a one-order of magnitude
difference for $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}\gtrsim100$. We conclude that
incorporating the scale-height derivative into a GR slim disk model is crucial
as it impacts the disk structure and its resultant spectrum, particularly on a
soft-X-ray waveband.

are time-reversible, symplectic, and have the same dynamic invariances. There

However, mediating the interaction of SR-SPPs with photons in planar films is
difficult because of the large momentum mismatch. For efficient coupling,
nanostructuring such thin films (~20nm thickness), or placing metallic
nanostructures in close proximity to the planar film is technologically
challenging and can strongly influence the SR-SPP properties. In this paper,
harnessing SR-SPPs in planar silver films is demonstrated using
disorder-engineered metasurfaces. The disorder-engineering is realized by the

  Scherpen","Angle-based formation stabilization and maneuvers in port-Hamiltonian
  form with bearing and velocity measurements",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a port-Hamiltonian framework for angle-based formation
stabilization and maneuvers using bearing and velocity measurements with an
underlying triangulated Laman graph. The corresponding port-Hamiltonian
controller is designed using virtual couplings on the errors of angle
constraints in angle space and then the angle constraints and agent actuators
are mapped by the constraint Jacobian, which can be applied to other formation
constraints. In addition, due to the fact that the port-Hamiltonian model
allows for complex and heterogeneous agent dynamics, our framework can be
extended to networks with different agent dynamics and formation constraints.
To avoid unavailable distance terms in the control law, an estimator is
designed based on port-Hamiltonian theory and the property that energy is
coordinate-free for different sensor modalities using bearing and velocity
measurements, which permits our framework to inject damping for the formation
maneuvers. Furthermore, several maneuvers are analyzed under both
considerations of stabilization and transient performance. Simulations are
performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

the selection of an individual is independent of nominations cast by that
individual, and $\alpha$-optimal if under any circumstance the expected number
of nominations received by the selected individual is at least $\alpha$ times

may cast an arbitrary number of nominations, the so-called permutation

mechanism does better and prior to this work was known to be $67/108$-optimal

another mechanism called plurality with runner-up, and some new ideas,
$2105/3147$-optimality can be achieved for all $n$. We finally give new upper

advances towards the fainter ends of the other two clusters. We observed a dip

signifies that the cluster is neither contracting nor evaporating. The Galactic

black-box tuning has been proposed, which utilizes derivative-free optimization

prompts. However, these gradient-free methods still exhibit a significant gap
compared to gradient-based methods. In this paper, we introduce gradient
descent into black-box tuning scenario through knowledge distillation.
Furthermore, we propose a novel method GDFO, which integrates gradient descent

Hence, obtaining a model with high performance is exceedingly time-consuming

therefore, requires improved optimization algorithms with high convergence
rates. The single objective-based optimization methods generally used are
mostly time-consuming and do not guarantee optimum performance in all cases.
Mathematical optimization problems containing multiple objective functions that
must be optimized simultaneously fall under the category of multi-objective

difference in generalization between models trained on synthetic and original

critical conditions for the metric to converge. An intriguing result is that
the synthetic feature distribution is not necessarily identical to the original
one for the convergence of the utility metric as long as the model
specification in downstream learning tasks is correct. Another important
utility metric is model comparison based on synthetic data. Specifically, we
establish sufficient conditions for synthetic data algorithms so that the
ranking of generalization performances of models trained on the synthetic data

Furthermore, PyDiff uses a global corrector to alleviate the global degradation

selects a group of moderate-frequency words from a general text corpus to form
a trigger set, then selects a target embedding as the watermark, and inserts it
into the embeddings of texts containing trigger words as the backdoor. The
weight of insertion is proportional to the number of trigger words included in

with a floating flexible plate on the top surface. The stress balance at the
surface is modeled using a modified membrane equation. There is an insoluble
surfactant at the liquid-liquid interface of the flow system. The linear
instability of perturbation waves is captured by numerically solving the
generalized Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem using Chebyshev spectral
collocation technique. Four different types of linear stability modes are
identified: namely surface mode (SM), interface mode (IM), interface surfactant
mode (ISM), and shear mode (SHM). The floating flexible plate has an inferior
impact on all the existing modes in the longwave zone. However, a significant
influence is noticed for the finite wave numbers. The surface and interface
wave instabilities can be suppressed in the smaller wavenumber zone by imposing
higher structural rigidity and uniform thickness of the flexible plate. The
stabilizing nature of the surface mode becomes more powerful when the top layer
viscosity is dominant. A new interfacial instability emerges when the top layer
is less viscous than the lower one. At moderate Reynolds numbers, the behaviour
of interface mode is different in two different zones $mr<1$ and $mr>1$, where
$m$ and $r$ denote the viscosity and density ratio, respectively. Further, the
unstable shear modes induced by the top and bottom layers are detected under
the low inclination angles with a strong inertia force. The occurrence of the
shear modes demands the bottom layer's viscosity and density to be very high
than that of the upper layer. The influence of characteristic parameters of the
flexible plate on the lower layer shear mode is not very sensitive. Finally,
the competition between the different modes for dominance of stability
boundaries is also discussed.

galaxy to construct 22500 mock spectra in 300 directions from $z = 3$ to 4.
Remarkably, we show that one galaxy can reproduce the variety of a large sample

exhibit double-peak profiles with a dominant red peak, their shapes cover a
large parameter space in terms of peak velocities, peak separation and flux
ratio. This diversity originates from radiative transfer effects at ISM and CGM
scales, and depends on galaxy inclination and evolutionary phase. Red-dominated
lines preferentially arise in face-on directions during post-starburst outflows
and are bright. Conversely, accretion phases usually yield symmetric double
peaks in the edge-on direction and are fainter. While resonant scattering
effects at $< 0.2\times R_{\rm vir}$ are responsible for the broadening and
velocity shift of the red peak, the extended CGM acts as a screen and impacts
the observed peak separation. The ability of simulations to reproduce observed
Ly$\alpha$ profiles and link their properties with galaxy physical parameters
offers new perspectives to use Ly$\alpha$ to constrain the mechanisms that

recently, and the captured multi-dimensional activity and vital sign signals
can be studied in association with health outcomes to inform public health. The
common approach is the scalar-on-function regression model, in which health
outcomes are the scalar responses while high-dimensional sensor signals are the
functional covariates, but how to effectively interpret results becomes
difficult. In this study, we propose a new Functional Adaptive Double-Sparsity
(FadDoS) estimator based on functional regularization of sparse group lasso
with multiple functional predictors, which can achieve global sparsity via
functional variable selection and local sparsity via zero-subinterval
identification within coefficient functions. We prove that the FadDoS estimator
converges at a bounded rate and satisfies the oracle property under mild
conditions. Extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical properties and
exhibit excellent performances compared to existing approaches. Application to
a Kinect sensor study that utilized an advanced motion sensing device tracking
human multiple joint movements and conducted among community-dwelling elderly
demonstrates how the FadDoS estimator can effectively characterize the detailed
association between joint movements and physical health assessments. The
proposed method is not only effective in Kinect sensor analysis but also
applicable to broader fields, where multi-dimensional sensor signals are
collected simultaneously, to expand the use of sensor devices in health studies
and facilitate sensor data analysis.

particular, we consider that a multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) employs
the transmit energy beamforming to charge multiple single-antenna low-power
wireless devices (WDs) in the downlink, and the WDs use the harvested energy to
simultaneously send their messages to the HAP for AirComp in the uplink. Under
this setup, we minimize the computation mean square error (MSE), by jointly
optimizing the transmit energy beamforming and the receive AirComp beamforming
at the HAP, as well as the transmit power at the WDs, subject to the maximum
transmit power constraint at the HAP and the wireless energy harvesting
constraints at individual WDs. To tackle the non-convex computation MSE
minimization problem, we present an efficient algorithm to find a converged
high-quality solution by using the alternating optimization technique.
Numerical results show that the proposed joint WPT-AirComp approach
significantly reduces the computation MSE, as compared to other benchmark

downshift for the disks with larger diameter. Micromagnetic simulations suggest

maintenance work before equipment failure. In this context, detecting early
faults in automated teller machines (ATMs) has become increasingly important
since these machines are susceptible to various types of unpredictable
failures. ATMs track execution status by generating massive event-log data that
collect system messages unrelated to the failure event. Predicting machine
failure based on event logs poses additional challenges, mainly in extracting
features that might represent sequences of events indicating impending
failures. Accordingly, feature learning approaches are currently being used in
PdM, where informative features are learned automatically from minimally
processed sensor data. However, a gap remains to be seen on how these
approaches can be exploited for deriving relevant features from event-log-based
data. To fill this gap, we present a predictive model based on a convolutional
kernel (MiniROCKET and HYDRA) to extract features from the original event-log
data and a linear classifier to classify the sample based on the learned
features. The proposed methodology is applied to a significant real-world
collected dataset. Experimental results demonstrated how one of the proposed
convolutional kernels (i.e. HYDRA) exhibited the best classification
performance (accuracy of 0.759 and AUC of 0.693). In addition, statistical
analysis revealed that the HYDRA and MiniROCKET models significantly overcome
one of the established state-of-the-art approaches in time series
classification (InceptionTime), and three non-temporal ML methods from the

where rotation equivariant is crucial for detectors to predict rotated bounding
boxes. It is expected that the prediction can maintain the corresponding
rotation when objects rotate, but severe mutational in angular prediction is
sometimes observed when objects rotate near the boundary angle, which is
well-known boundary discontinuity problem. The problem has been long believed
to be caused by the sharp loss increase at the angular boundary during
training, and widely used IoU-like loss generally deal with this problem by
loss-smoothing. However, we experimentally find that even state-of-the-art
IoU-like methods do not actually solve the problem. On further analysis, we
find the essential cause of the problem lies at discontinuous angular
ground-truth(box), not just discontinuous loss. There always exists an
irreparable gap between continuous model ouput and discontinuous angular
ground-truth, so angular prediction near the breakpoints becomes highly
unstable, which cannot be eliminated just by loss-smoothing in IoU-like
methods. To thoroughly solve this problem, we propose a simple and effective
Angle Correct Module (ACM) based on polar coordinate decomposition. ACM can be
easily plugged into the workflow of oriented object detectors to repair angular
prediction. It converts the smooth value of the model output into sawtooth
angular value, and then IoU-like loss can fully release their potential.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that whether Gaussian-based or
SkewIoU methods are improved to the same performance of AP50 and AP75 with the
enhancement of ACM.

movements available in the literature.
  After the first successful approaches to solving a regularised version of the
model, researchers focused on the structure of the Riemann problem, which led
to local-in-time existence results for Riemann-type data and paved the way for
a WFT (Wave-Front Tracking) approach to the solution semigroup. In parallel, a
DPA (Deterministic Particles Approximation) approach was developed in the
spirit of follow-the-leader approximation results for scalar conservation laws.
Beyond having proved to be powerful analytical tools, the WFT and the DPA
approaches also led to interesting numerical results.
  However, only existence theorems on very specific classes of initial data
(essentially ruling out non-classical shocks) have been available until very
recently. A proper existence result using a DPA approach was proven not long
ago in the case of a linear coupling with the density in the eikonal equation.
Shortly after, a similar result was proven via a fixed point approach.
  We provide a detailed statement of the aforementioned results and sketch the
main proofs. We also provide a brief overview of results that are related to
Hughes' model, such as the derivation of a dynamic version of the model via a
mean-field game strategy, an alternative optimal control approach, and a
localized version of the model. We also present the main numerical results
within the WFT and DPA frameworks.

imaging (T1-MRI) presents a significant challenge due to the lack of direct
regional connectivity information. Current methods with T1-MRI rely on
predefined regions or isolated pretrained location modules to obtain atrophic
regions, which neglects individual specificity. Besides, existing methods
capture global structural context only on the whole-image-level, which weaken
correlation between regions and the hierarchical distribution nature of brain
connectivity.We hereby propose a novel dynamic structural brain network
construction method based on T1-MRI, which can dynamically localize critical
regions and constrain the hierarchical distribution among them for constructing
dynamic structural brain network. Specifically, we first cluster
spatially-correlated channel and generate several critical brain regions as
prototypes. Further, we introduce a contrastive loss function to constrain the
prototypes distribution, which embed the hierarchical brain semantic structure
into the latent space. Self-attention and GCN are then used to dynamically
construct hierarchical correlations of critical regions for brain network and
explore the correlation, respectively. Our method is evaluated on ADNI-1 and
ADNI-2 databases for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction, and
acheive the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Our source code is available

This allows us to prove Bloch's conjecture for symplectic birational

present the CWD30 dataset, a large-scale, diverse, holistic, and hierarchical

CWD30 comprises over 219,770 high-resolution images of 20 weed species and 10
crop species, encompassing various growth stages, multiple viewing angles, and
environmental conditions. The images were collected from diverse agricultural
fields across different geographic locations and seasons, ensuring a

fine-grained classification and facilitates the development of more accurate,

experiments to validate the efficacy of the CWD30 dataset. Our experiments
reveal that the dataset poses significant challenges due to intra-class
variations, inter-class similarities, and data imbalance. Additionally, we
demonstrate that minor training modifications like using CWD30 pretrained

spectral panoramic images Methods: A simulation framework for generating
synthetic spectral panoramic images from CT volumes is described. A cone beam
CT scan of an anthropomorphic head phantom is used as input. An experimental
spectral panoramic image of the same phantom is acquired. The framework also
includes a tool for estimating anatomical noise. Results: The output of the
framework of an anthropomorphic head phantom is compared against an
experimental spectral panoramic image of the same phantom. The synthetic and
experimental spectral panoramic images resemble each other considerably,
especially the bone features. In the soft tissue images there are some
differences, which are a result of the differences on how each image is
generated. Finally, anatomical noise is revealed to be small, with the spread
in the values in the order of 1 cm for the soft tissue and 1 mm for the
cortical bone through most of the image. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that
generating synthetic spectral panoramic images from CT volumes is possible. The
synthetic images have many similarities with the experimental results,
increasing the confidence in the correctness of the information contained
within experimental spectral panoramic images and indicating that the synthetic

refers to the cognitive and emotional reactions of an individual to the
observed experiences of another and it is more complex than mere mimicry of
emotion. Hence, it requires identifying complex human conversational strategies

empathetic responding capabilities of chatbots. In this work, we make use of a

and distance of the cluster as 510 +/- 190 Myr and 2.64 +/- 0.11 kpc, using
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). We have also obtained distance as 2.77 +/-
0.42 kpc using the parallax method. Interstellar reddening E(B-V) in the
direction of the cluster is determined as 0.45 mag using the ((J - H), (J - K))
colour-colour diagram. We have found the mass function slope for main-sequence
stars as 1.39 +/- 0.29 within the mass range 1.0 - 2.7 solar mass, which agrees
with Salpeter's value within uncertainty. Galactic orbits are derived using the
Galactic potential model, indicating that NGC 5288 follows a circular path

revolutionized by the Fermi-LAT Telescope, which provides an excellent
opportunity to study the physical properties of GeV radio galaxies. According
to the radio power and morphology, radio galaxies can be separated into
Fanaroff-Riley Type I radio galaxies (FR-Is) and Type II radio galaxies
(FR-IIs). In this paper, we consider the unification of FR-Is and BL Lacertae
objects (BL Lacs), and assume FR-Is to be a standard candle to discuss the
beaming effect for Fermi-LAT-detected FR-Is. Our main conclusions are as
follows: (1) The estimated Doppler factors for 30 Fermi-LAT-detected FR-Is are
in a range of $\delta_{\rm{I}}=0.88-7.49$. The average Doppler factor
($<\delta_{\rm{I}}>=2.56\pm0.30$) of the 30 FR-Is is smaller than that
($<\delta_{\rm{BL}}>=10.28\pm2.03$) of the 126 Fermi-LAT-detected BL Lacs,
supporting the unification model that FR-Is are regarded as the misaligned BL
Lacs with smaller Doppler factors; (2) We propose that different regions of
FR-Is in the plot of the $\gamma$-ray luminosity against the photon spectral
index $(\log L_{\gamma}-\alpha_{\rm{ph}})$ may indicate the different beaming
effects; (3) The average Doppler factor of the 6 TeV FR-Is is similar to that
of the 24 non-TeV FR-Is, which implies that the difference between the TeV and
GeV emissions is not driven by the beaming effect in the Fermi-LAT-detected
FR-I samples.

content across a world-scale audience. In this context, predicting whether a
post will have any impact in terms of engagement is of crucial importance to
drive the profitable exploitation of these media. In the literature, several
studies address this issue by leveraging direct features of the posts,
typically related to the textual content and the user publishing it. In this
paper, we argue that the rise of engagement is also related to another key
component, which is the semantic connection among posts published by users in
social media. Hence, we propose TweetGage, a Graph Neural Network solution to
predict the user engagement based on a novel graph-based model that represents
the relationships among posts. To validate our proposal, we focus on the
Twitter platform and perform a thorough experimental campaign providing
evidence of its quality.

are deploying short aperiodic loaded loop antennas measuring radio signals from
extensive air showers in the 30-80 MHz band on each of the 1,660 surface
detector stations. This new Radio Detector of the Observatory allows us to
measure the energy in the electromagnetic cascade of inclined air showers with
zenith angles larger than $\sim 65^\circ$. The water-Cherenkov detectors, in
turn, perform a virtually pure measurement of the muon component of inclined
air showers. The combination of both thus extends the mass-composition
sensitivity of the upgraded Observatory to high zenith angles and therefore
enlarges the sky coverage of mass-sensitive measurements at the highest
energies while at the same time allowing us to cross-check the performance of
the established detectors with an additional measurement technique. In this
contribution, we outline the concept and design of the Radio Detector, report
on its current status and initial results from the first deployed stations, and
illustrate its expected performance with a detailed, end-to-end simulation

we make an overview of the current state of studies on this coupling between

conduction regime inside the solids on conduction-radiation coupling. We also
describe how the shape of solids affects this coupling. We show that this
coupling can be at the origin of a drastic change of temperature profiles
inside each body and of heat flux exchanged between them. These results could
have important implications in the fields of nanoscale thermal management,
near-field solid-state cooling and nanoscale energy conversion.

will be applied, based on a Wigner transformation of the Klein-Gordon equation.
The resulting theory is similar in many respects to the equations from the
Dirac-Heisenberg-Wigner formalism. However, in the former case, all physics
related to particle spin is neglected. In the present paper we compare the
pair-production rate in vacuum and plasmas, with and without spin effects, in
order to evaluate the accuracy and applicability of the spinless approximation.
It is found that for modest frequencies of the electromagnetic field, the pair
production rate of the Klein-Gordon theory is a good approximation to the Dirac
theory, provided the matter density is small enough for Pauli blocking to be
neglected, and a factor of two related to the difference in the vacuum energy
density is compensated for.

most common contaminant and alters numerous properties of a cryogenic optical
system. Too much ice means that Euclid's calibration requirements and science
goals cannot be met. Euclid must then be thermally decontaminated, a long and
risky process. We need to understand how iced optics affect the data and when a
decontamination is required. This is essential to build adequate calibration
and survey plans, yet a comprehensive analysis in the context of an
astrophysical space survey has not been done before.
  In this paper we look at other spacecraft with well-documented outgassing
records, and we review the formation of thin ice films. A mix of amorphous and
crystalline ices is expected for Euclid. Their surface topography depends on
the competing energetic needs of the substrate-water and the water-water
interfaces, and is hard to predict with current theories. We illustrate that
with scanning-tunnelling and atomic-force microscope images.
  Industrial tools exist to estimate contamination, and we must understand
their uncertainties. We find considerable knowledge errors on the diffusion and
sublimation coefficients, limiting the accuracy of these tools. We developed a
water transport model to compute contamination rates in Euclid, and find
general agreement with industry estimates. Tests of the Euclid flight hardware
in space simulators did not pick up contamination signals; our in-flight
calibrations observations will be much more sensitive.
  We must understand the link between the amount of ice on the optics and its
effect on Euclid's data. Little research is available about this link, possibly
because other spacecraft can decontaminate easily, quenching the need for a
deeper understanding. In our second paper we quantify the various effects of
iced optics on spectrophotometric data.

(G-CNN) have been demonstrated to increase CNN's data efficiency and contribute
to better interpretability and controllability of CNN models. However, so far
filter-decomposition-based affine G-CNN methods rely on parameter sharing for
achieving high parameter efficiency and suffer from a heavy computational
burden. They also use a limited number of transformations and in particular
ignore the shear transform in the application. In this paper, we address these
problems by emphasizing the importance of the diversity of transformations. We
propose a flexible and efficient strategy based on weighted filter-wise Monte
Carlo sampling. In addition, we introduce shear equivariant CNN to address the
highly sparse representations of natural images. We demonstrate that the
proposed methods are intrinsically an efficient generalization of traditional
CNNs, and we explain the advantage of bottleneck architectures used in the
existing state-of-the-art CNN models such as ResNet, ResNext, and ConvNeXt from
the group-equivariant perspective. Experiments on image classification and
image denoising tasks show that with a set of suitable filter basis, our
methods achieve superior performance to standard CNN with high data efficiency.

promising candidate for the high-speed switching. It is known that the
switching speed of the ballistic switching can be increased by increasing the
magnitude of the pulsed magnetic field. However it is difficult to generate a
strong and short magnetic field pulse in a small device. Here we explore
another direction to achieve the high-speed ballistic switching by designing
material parameters such as anisotropy constant, saturation magnetization, and
the Gilbert damping constant. We perform the macrospin simulations for the
ballistic switching of in-plane magnetized nano magnets with varying material
parameters. The results are analyzed based on the switching dynamics on the
energy density contour. We show that the pulse width required for the ballistic
switching can be reduced by increasing the magnetic anisotropy constant or by
decreasing the saturation magnetization. We also show that there exists an
optimal value of the Gilbert damping constant that minimizes the pulse width
required for the ballistic switching.

unsupervised manner. However, the design of the neural network structure
basically relies on prior knowledge and experience, which has caused great
trouble and high computational overhead. Therefore, we propose a neural
architecture search-guided method, namely NAS-PINN, to automatically search the
optimum neural architecture for solving certain PDEs. By relaxing the search
space into a continuous one and utilizing masks to realize the addition of
tensors in different shapes, NAS-PINN can be trained through a bi-level
optimization, where the inner loop optimizes the weights and bias of neural
networks and the outer loop the architecture parameters. We verify the ability
of NAS-PINN by several numerical experiments including Poisson, Burgers, and
Advection equations. The characteristics of effective neural architectures for
solving different PDEs are summarized, which can be used to guide the design of
neural networks in PINN. It is found that more hidden layers do not necessarily
mean better performance and sometimes can be harmful. Especially for Poisson
and Advection, a shallow neural network with more neurons is more appropriate
in PINNs. It is also indicated that for complex problems, neural networks with
residual connection can improve the performance of PINNs.

  Using a Mid-Infrared Push Pulse",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In organic bulk heterojunction materials, charge delocalization has been
proposed to play a vital role in the generation of free carriers by reducing
the Coulomb attraction via an interfacial charge transfer exciton (CTX).
Pump-push-probe (PPP) experiments produced evidence that the excess energy
given by a push pulse enhances delocalization, thereby increasing photocurrent.
However, previous studies have employed near-IR push pulses in the range
0.4-0.6 eV which is larger than the binding energy of a typical CTX. This
raises the doubt that the push pulse may directly promote dissociation without
involving delocalized states. Here, we perform PPP experiments with mid-IR push
pulses at energies that are well below the binding energy of a CTX state
(0.12-0.25 eV). We identify three types of CTX: delocalized, localized, and
trapped. The excitation resides over multiple polymer chains in delocalized
CTXs, while is restricted to a single chain (albeit maintaining a degree of
intrachain delocalization) in localized CTXs. Trapped CTXs are instead
completely localized. The pump pulse generates a hot delocalized CTX, which
relaxes to a localized CTX, and eventually to trapped states. We find that
photo-exciting localized CTXs with push pulses resonant to the mid-IR charge
transfer absorption can promote delocalization and contribute to the formation
of long-lived charge separated states. On the other hand, we found that trapped
CTX are non-responsive to the push pulses. We hypothesize that delocalized
states identified in prior studies are only accessible in systems where there
is significant interchain electronic coupling or regioregularity that supports
either interchain or intrachain polaron delocalization. This emphasizes the
importance of engineering the micromorphology and energetics of the
donor-acceptor interface to exploit a full potential of a material for
photovoltaic applications.

X-ray detectors with fast detection capability, which can be expensive and
results a large amount of data. This paper discussed a different approach,
where fast XCT was realised via the acquisition of a small number of projection
images instead of full projection images. An established total variation (TV)
algorithm was used to handle the reconstruction. The paper investigates the
feasibility of using the TV algorithm in handling a significantly reduced
number of projection images for reconstruction. This allows a reduction of
measurement time from fifty-two minutes to one minute for a typical industrial
XCT system. It also enables a reduction of data size proportionally. A test
strategy including both quantitative and qualitative test metrics was
considered to evaluate the effectiveness of the reconstruction algorithm. The
qualitative evaluation includes both the signal to noise ratio and the contrast
to noise ratio. The quantitative evaluation was established using reference
samples with different internal and external geometries. Simulation data were

request, we use batch rekeying to alleviate the out-of-sync problem and improve
the efficiency. In this paper, we propose an optimization approach to the
problem of updating group key in the Logical Key Hierarchy (LKH) structure with
batch rekeying. A subtree of new nodes can be appended below a leaf node or is
replaced the position of leaving node on the binary key tree. The latter has a
lower updating key cost than the former since when a member leaves, all the
keys on the path from the root to the deletion node must be updated anyway. We
aim to minimize the total rekeying cost, which is the cost of deletion and
insertion members while keeping the tree as balanced as possible. The mentioned
problem is represented by a unified (deterministic) optimization model whose
objective function contains discontinuous step functions with binary variables.
Thanks to an exact penalty technique, the problem is equivalently reformulated
as a standard DC (Difference of Convex functions) program that can be solved
efficiently by DCA (DC algorithm). Numerical experiments have been studied

addition, it is difficult to use machine learning techniques because they use
face-related 3D medical data with radiation exposure, which are difficult to

identifies paired 3D landmarks from knowledge of the corresponding 2D

election manifestos or parliamentary speeches plays an increasing role in
computational political science. However, existing approaches are fundamentally
limited to targeting only global party (dis)-similarity: they condense the
relationship between a pair of parties into a single figure, their similarity.
In aggregating over all policy domains (e.g., health or foreign policy), they
do not provide any qualitative insights into which domains parties agree or
disagree on. This paper proposes a workflow for estimating policy domain aware
party similarity that overcomes this limitation. The workflow covers (a)
definition of suitable policy domains; (b) automatic labeling of domains, if no
manual labels are available; (c) computation of domain-level similarities and
aggregation at a global level; (d) extraction of interpretable party positions
on major policy axes via multidimensional scaling. We evaluate our workflow on
manifestos from the German federal elections. We find that our method (a)
yields high correlation when predicting party similarity at a global level and
(b) provides accurate party-specific positions, even with automatically
labelled policy domains.

deliver energy or stimuli in opaque and complex media. However, most materials
only show a weak response to ultrasound, and those materials that are
responsive to ultrasound to date require the use of high-powers, which is
associated with undesirable effects such as streaming, cavitation, or
temperature rise. These effects make it difficult to control the response and
may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover,
materials that are currently in use typically make use of all-or-nothing
effects, limiting the ability to fine-tune the response of the material on the
fly. For these reasons, it would be desirable to identify materials that can
respond to low intensity ultrasound. Here we demonstrate that antibubbles are a
low-intensity-ultrasound-responsive material system that can controllably
release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kPa range. By tuning the size
and composition of the antibubble, the release pressure can be tuned, and the
response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across
multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high-speed
microscopy revealed the different ways in which antibubbles respond to
ultrasound and release the payload. Our findings lay the groundwork to design
antibubble formulations that controllably respond to low-intensity ultrasound
and thereby open up a wide range of applications ranging from
ultrasound-responsive material systems to advanced contrast agents and carriers
for targeted delivery.

playing the roles of a buyer and a seller, respectively. They aim to reach a
deal with the buyer targeting a lower price and the seller a higher one. A
third language model, playing the critic, provides feedback to a player to
improve the player's negotiation strategies. We let the two agents play
multiple rounds, using previous negotiation history and AI feedback as
in-context demonstrations to improve the model's negotiation strategy
iteratively. We use different LLMs (GPT and Claude) for different roles and use
the deal price as the evaluation metric. Our experiments reveal multiple
intriguing findings: (1) Only a subset of the language models we consider can
self-play and improve the deal price from AI feedback, weaker models either do
not understand the game's rules or cannot incorporate AI feedback for further
improvement. (2) Models' abilities to learn from the feedback differ when
playing different roles. For example, it is harder for Claude-instant to
improve as the buyer than as the seller. (3) When unrolling the game to
multiple rounds, stronger agents can consistently improve their performance by
meaningfully using previous experiences and iterative AI feedback, yet have a
higher risk of breaking the deal. We hope our work provides insightful initial
explorations of having models autonomously improve each other with game playing

into the influence of language modality on VQA performance from an empirical

bias caused by question types, there is a notable influence of postfix-related
bias in inducing biases, and 2) training VQA models with word-sequence-related

type Ia supernovae have emerged. These peculiar observations hint not only at
surpassing the Chandrasekhar limit but may also suggest potential modifications
in the physical attributes of their progenitors, such as their cooling rate.
This, in turn, can influence their temporal assessments and provide a
compelling explanation for these intriguing observations. In this spirit, we
investigate here the cooling process of white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity with
the simplest model $f(R,T) = R + \lambda T$, where $\lambda$ is the model
parameter. Our modelling suggests that the cooling timescale of white dwarfs
exhibits an inverse relationship with the model parameter $\lambda$, which
implies that for identical initial conditions, white dwarfs in $f(R,T)$ gravity
cool faster. This further unveils that in the realm of $f(R,T)$ gravity, the
energy release rate for white dwarfs increases as $\lambda$ increases.
Furthermore, we also report that the luminosity of the white dwarfs also
depends on $\lambda$ and an upswing in $\lambda$ leads to an amplification in
the luminosity, and consequently a larger white dwarf in general relativity can
exhibit comparable luminosity to a smaller white dwarf in $f(R,T)$ gravity.

to disentangle these contributions in NiO. Upon resonant optical excitation
across the charge transfer gap, the Ni $L_3$ and O $K$ absorption edges
red-shift for $>10$ ps, which is explained by a simultaneous Hartree shift and
a renormalization of the local interactions. Furthermore, below the Ni $L_3$

extracting rich multi-scale contextual information by sequentially connecting

maintains the contextual information but also emphasizes the complementary

idea of compactness extrapolation and by extending it to the whole plane.
  This new method of proof is robust and, when applied to viscous models, leads
to a remarkable logarithmic improvement on the rate of convergence in the
vanishing viscosity limit of two-dimensional fluids. Loosely speaking, this
logarithmic gain is the result of the fact that, in appropriate high-regularity
settings, the smoothness of solutions to the Euler equations at times $t\in
[0,T)$ is strictly higher than their regularity at time $t=T$. This ``memory
effect'' seems to be a general principle which is not exclusive to fluid
mechanics. It is therefore likely to be observed in other setting and deserves
further investigation.
  Finally, we also apply the stability results on Euler systems to the study of
two-dimensional ideal plasmas and establish their convergence, in strong
topologies, to solutions of magnetohydrodynamic systems, when the speed of
light tends to infinity. The crux of this asymptotic analysis relies on a fine

e.g., demand the processing of massive data in motion and at rest. As such, key
research aspects are the support for low-latency control loops, concepts on

semantically rich and efficient long-term storage. In particular, such an
infrastructure cannot continue to be limited to machines and sensors, but
additionally needs to encompass networked environments: production cells, edge

  We also show that every family is an induced subfamily of an extremal family,

  As a byproduct of these arguments, we give yet another characterization of
the families of $k$-sets satisfying equality in the Kruskal--Katona theorem.
Such characterization is, at first glance, less appealing than the one in

However, the arguments used to prove such characterization provide additional
insight on the structure of the extremal families themselves.

worldwide. However, wind farm power control faces significant challenges due to
the high system complexity inherent in these farms. A novel communication-based
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning large-scale wind farm multivariate
control is proposed to handle this challenge and maximize power output. A wind
farm multivariate power model is proposed to study the influence of wind
turbines (WTs) wake on power. The multivariate model includes axial induction
factor, yaw angle, and tilt angle controllable variables. The hierarchical
communication multi-agent proximal policy optimization (HCMAPPO) algorithm is
proposed to coordinate the multivariate large-scale wind farm continuous
controls. The large-scale wind farm is divided into multiple wind turbine
aggregators (WTAs), and neighboring WTAs can exchange information through
hierarchical communication to maximize the wind farm power output. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed multivariate HCMAPPO can significantly
increase wind farm power output compared to the traditional PID control,
coordinated model-based predictive control, and multi-agent deep deterministic
policy gradient algorithm. Particularly, the HCMAPPO algorithm can be trained
with the environment based on the thirteen-turbine wind farm and effectively
applied to larger wind farms. At the same time, there is no significant
increase in the fatigue damage of the wind turbine blade from the wake control
as the wind farm scale increases. The multivariate HCMAPPO control can realize

  Even in effectively conducted randomised trials, the probability of a
successful study remains relatively low. With recent advances in the
next-generation sequencing technologies, there is a rapidly growing number of
high-dimensional data, including genetic, molecular and phenotypic information,
that have improved our understanding of driver genes, drug targets, and drug
mechanisms of action. The leveraging of high-dimensional data holds promise for
increased success of clinical trials.
  Methods
  We provide an overview of methods for utilising high-dimensional data in
clinical trials. We also investigate the use of these methods in practice
through a review of recently published randomised clinical trials that utilise
high-dimensional genetic data. The review includes articles that were published
between 2019 and 2021, identified through the PubMed database.
  Results
  Out of 174 screened articles, 100 (57.5%) were randomised clinical trials
that collected high-dimensional data. The most common clinical area was
oncology (30%), followed by chronic diseases (28%), nutrition and ageing (18%)
and cardiovascular diseases (7%). The most common types of data analysed were
gene expression data (70%), followed by DNA data (21%). The most common method
of analysis (36.3%) was univariable analysis. Articles that described
multivariable analyses used standard statistical methods. Most of the clinical
trials had two arms.
  Discussion
  New methodological approaches are required for more efficient analysis of the
increasing amount of high-dimensional data collected in randomised clinical
trials. We highlight the limitations and barriers to the current use of
high-dimensional data in trials, and suggest potential avenues for improvement
and future work.

area near the cavity reaches quasi-stationary state, the results show that with
inflow turbulence more robust vortices are developed in cavity shear layer and

turbulence enhances the entry of fresh mixture and this further supports flame
stabilisation near the cavity. However, the fully developed cavity shear layer
also leads to greater cavity resistance. As for the flame stabilization, with

is observed and promote the radical transport. These results give a preliminary

associated to grading-restricted (generalized) modules of $C_2$-cofinite VOAs.
  In this paper, we prove that if $\mathbb V$ is a $C_2$-cofinite VOA, if

$M$ outgoing ones, each equipped with a local coordinate, and if $\mathbb W$ is

machine learning models. Recent research has made significant strides in
detecting and quantifying feature interactions in single predictive models.
However, we argue that the feature interactions extracted from a single

model may not preserve the true feature interactions and there exist multiple
well-performing predictive models that differ in feature interaction strengths.
Thus, we recommend exploring feature interaction strengths in a model class of
approximately equally accurate predictive models. In this work, we introduce
the feature interaction score (FIS) in the context of a Rashomon set,
representing a collection of models that achieve similar accuracy on a given
task. We propose a general and practical algorithm to calculate the FIS in the

draw connections to other areas of statistics. Additionally, we introduce a
Halo plot for visualizing the feature interaction variance in high-dimensional

recidivism prediction and image classification illustrate how feature
interactions can vary dramatically in importance for similarly accurate
predictive models. Our results suggest that the proposed FIS can provide

situations with skewed and heavy-tailed outcome distributions may benefit from
alternative criteria, such as quantiles. However, assessing dynamic quantile
treatment effects (QTE) remains a challenge, particularly when dealing with
data from ride-sourcing platforms that involve sequential decision-making
across time and space. In this paper, we establish a formal framework to
calculate QTE conditional on characteristics independent of the treatment.
Under specific model assumptions, we demonstrate that the dynamic conditional
QTE (CQTE) equals the sum of individual CQTEs across time, even though the
conditional quantile of cumulative rewards may not necessarily equate to the
sum of conditional quantiles of individual rewards. This crucial insight
significantly streamlines the estimation and inference processes for our target
causal estimand. We then introduce two varying coefficient decision process
(VCDP) models and devise an innovative method to test the dynamic CQTE.
Moreover, we expand our approach to accommodate data from spatiotemporal
dependent experiments and examine both conditional quantile direct and indirect
effects. To showcase the practical utility of our method, we apply it to three
real-world datasets from a ride-sourcing platform. Theoretical findings and
comprehensive simulation studies further substantiate our proposal.

However, clinician biases reflected in EHR notes can lead to AI models
inheriting and amplifying these biases, perpetuating health disparities. This
study investigates the impact of stigmatizing language (SL) in EHR notes on
mortality prediction using a Transformer-based deep learning model and
explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our findings demonstrate that SL written by
clinicians adversely affects AI performance, particularly so for black
patients, highlighting SL as a source of racial disparity in AI model
development. To explore an operationally efficient way to mitigate SL's impact,
we investigate patterns in the generation of SL through a clinicians'
collaborative network, identifying central clinicians as having a stronger
impact on racial disparity in the AI model. We find that removing SL written by
central clinicians is a more efficient bias reduction strategy than eliminating
all SL in the entire corpus of data. This study provides actionable insights

that share said input structure but are not restricted to the computations of

is to determine whether there are any other stackable models in KVQ Space that
Attention cannot efficiently approximate, which we can implement with our
current deep learning toolbox and that solve problems that are interesting to
the community. Maybe surprisingly, the solution to the standard least squares
problem satisfies these properties. A neural network module that is able to
compute this solution not only enriches the set of computations that a neural
network can represent but is also provably a strict generalisation of Linear
Attention. Even more surprisingly the computational complexity of this module
is exactly the same as that of Attention, making it a suitable drop in
replacement. With this novel connection between classical machine learning
(least squares) and modern deep learning (Attention) established we justify a
variation of our model which generalises regular Attention in the same way.
Both new modules are put to the test an a wide spectrum of tasks ranging from
few-shot learning to policy distillation that confirm their real-worlds

Our method consists of iteratively training neural classifiers to predict a

the BIM-based design process by integrating data logging and 4D visualization
techniques. First of all, potential design behaviors and procedures are
analyzed and extracted by observing how a designer designs a BIM model.
Meanwhile, the required data for logging design process is defined and a
relevant method to collect these data is developed based on the APIs of BIM
software. Then, strategies on how to visualize different design procedures are
designed and implemented via 4D visualization. Finally, a prototype system is
developed based on Autodesk Revit and validated through a case study. Result

Instead, we seek to answer the following question: In a realistic tracking
by-detection context, how does object ReID from point clouds perform relative
to ReID from images? To enable such a study, we propose a lightweight matching
head that can be concatenated to any set or sequence processing backbone (e.g.,
PointNet or ViT), creating a family of comparable object ReID networks for both
modalities. Run in siamese style, our proposed point-cloud ReID networks can
make thousands of pairwise comparisons in real-time (10 hz). Our findings
demonstrate that their performance increases with higher sensor resolution and
approaches that of image ReID when observations are sufficiently dense.
Additionally, we investigate our network's ability to enhance 3D multi-object

re-identify objects which led a strong motion-based tracker into error. To our

human-assigned objective weights, large amounts of historic plans to train an
artificial intelligence or long planning times. Many of the existing
auto-planning tools are difficult to extend to new planning goals.
  A new spot weight optimisation algorithm, called JulianA, was developed. The
algorithm minimises a scalar loss function that is built only based on the
prescribed dose to the tumour and organs at risk (OARs), but does not rely on
historic plans. The objective weights in the loss function have default values
that do not need to be changed for the patients in our dataset. The system is a
versatile tool for researchers and clinicians without specialised programming
skills. Extending it is as easy as adding an additional term to the loss
function. JulianA was validated on a dataset of 19 patients with intra- and
extracerebral neoplasms within the cranial region that had been treated at our
institute. For each patient, a reference plan which was delivered to the cancer
patient, was exported from our treatment database. Then JulianA created the
auto plan using the same beam arrangement. The reference and auto plans were
given to a blinded independent reviewer who assessed the acceptability of each
plan, ranked the plans and assigned the human-/machine-made labels.
  The auto plans were considered acceptable in 16 out of 19 patients and at

we propose an implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IU-FNO) for
stable and efficient predictions on the long-term large-scale dynamics of
turbulence. The IU-FNO model employs implicit recurrent Fourier layers for
deeper network extension and incorporates the U-net network for the accurate
prediction on small-scale flow structures. The model is systematically tested
in large-eddy simulations of three types of 3D turbulence, including forced
homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), temporally evolving turbulent mixing
layer, and decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The numerical simulations
demonstrate that the IU-FNO model is more accurate than other FNO-based models

dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) in predicting a variety of statistics including
the velocity spectrum, probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity and
velocity increments, and instantaneous spatial structures of flow field.
Moreover, IU-FNO improves long-term stable predictions, which has not been
achieved by the previous versions of FNO. Besides, the proposed model is much
faster than traditional LES with DSM model, and can be well generalized to the
situations of higher Taylor-Reynolds numbers and unseen flow regime of decaying

a great challenge due to degeneracies in WISE multicolor space and low
detection levels in its two longest-wavelength bandpasses. In this paper, the
deep learning classification network, IICnet (Infrared Image Classification
network), is designed to classify sources from WISE images to achieve a more
accurate classification goal. IICnet shows good ability on the feature
extraction of the WISE sources. Experiments demonstrates that the
classification results of IICnet are superior to some other methods; it has
obtained 96.2% accuracy for galaxies, 97.9% accuracy for quasars, and 96.4%
accuracy for stars, and the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the IICnet classifier can
reach more than 99%. In addition, the superiority of IICnet in processing
infrared images has been demonstrated in the comparisons with VGG16, GoogleNet,
ResNet34, MobileNet, EfficientNetV2, and RepVGG-fewer parameters and faster
inference. The above proves that IICnet is an effective method to classify
infrared sources.

problem for $\gamma=\frac{4}{3}$ is related to the best constant of a

yields a threshold of the mass to the gaseous star which is the Chandrasekhar
limit mass. For $\gamma\in \left(\frac{6}{5},\frac{4}{3} \right)$, we construct
a type of cross constrained variational problem attained by the Lane-Emden

  Regularization Parameter, Kernel, and Kernel Parameter Selection",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a robust machine learning algorithm with
broad applications in classification, regression, and outlier detection. SVM
requires tuning the regularization parameter (RP) which controls the model
capacity and the generalization performance. Conventionally, the optimum RP is
found by comparison of a range of values through the Cross-Validation (CV)
procedure. In addition, for non-linearly separable data, the SVM uses kernels
where a set of kernels, each with a set of parameters, denoted as a grid of
kernels, are considered. The optimal choice of RP and the grid of kernels is
through the grid-search of CV. By stochastically analyzing the behavior of the
regularization parameter, this work shows that the SVM performance can be
modeled as a function of separability and scatteredness (S&S) of the data.
Separability is a measure of the distance between classes, and scatteredness is
the ratio of the spread of data points. In particular, for the hinge loss cost
function, an S&S ratio-based table provides the optimum RP. The S&S ratio is a
powerful value that can automatically detect linear or non-linear separability
before using the SVM algorithm. The provided S&S ratio-based table can also
provide the optimum kernel and its parameters before using the SVM algorithm.
Consequently, the computational complexity of the CV grid-search is reduced to
only one time use of the SVM. The simulation results on the real dataset
confirm the superiority and efficiency of the proposed approach in the sense of
computational complexity over the grid-search CV method.

compensating for non-uniform lighting. With the intention of adapting denoising

image properties to acquire noise-free low-light images. Starting from the
properties of natural image manifolds, a self-regularized recovery loss is
introduced as a way to encourage more natural and realistic reflectance map.
The model architecture and training losses, guided by prior knowledge,

global symmetries. Out of all the zero-form symmetries, the quantum symmetries
in the bulk are truly emergent, while classical symmetries are identified as

formulated very generally as a ``folding'' of T-duality orbits via the
Siegel-Weil Theorem. We also discuss the interrelations between the Swampland
distance conjecture, on one hand, and ensemble averaging and spectral
decompositions, on the other. The spectral decomposition also illustrates how
ensemble averaging sits within the low-energy limit of certain string

of jet substructure observables with angularity exponent $a<2$ for infrared
safety. Variation of the angularity exponent allows to modify the relative
weighting of the collinear-to-soft radiations in the jet. In this article, we
focus on angularity exponents $a<1$ and provide detailed results for $a=-1,0$,

incorporated in the jet function via the use of in-medium splitting functions,
the soft function remains unmodified for $a<1$. For all values of $a$, we find

still challenging in extragalactic studies, even with the latest generation of

spectral stacking method that has been used in the literature to recover
low-intensity molecular line emission, such as HCN(1-0), HCO+(1-0), and even
fainter lines in external galaxies. The goal is to study the capabilities and
limitations of the stacking technique when applied to imaged interferometric
observations. The core idea of spectral stacking is to align spectra of the low
S/N spectral lines to a known velocity field calculated from a higher S/N line
expected to share the kinematics of the fainter line, e.g., CO(1-0) or 21-cm
emission. Then these aligned spectra can be coherently averaged to produce
potentially high S/N spectral stacks. Here, we use imaged simulated
interferometric and total power observations at different signal-to-noise
levels, based on real CO observations. For the combined interferometric and
total power data, we find that the spectral stacking technique is capable of
recovering the integrated intensities even at low S/N levels across most of the
region where the high S/N prior is detected. However, when stacking
interferometer-only data for low S/N emission, the stacks can miss up to 50% of
the emission from the fainter line. A key result of this analysis is that the
spectral stacking method is able to recover the true mean line intensities in
low S/N cubes and to accurately measure the statistical significance of the
recovered lines. To facilitate the application of this technique we provide a
public Python package, called PyStacker.

First, the non-Boltzmann heat capacity ratio $\gamma$, as a key property for

integration. Second, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations resembling a
shock tube setup are used to test the theory. The presented theory provides
heat capacity ratios ranging from the well-known $\gamma = 5/3$ for Boltzmann

molecular dynamics simulations of Boltzmann and non-Boltzmann driven gases
suggest that the shock wave propagates about 9% slower through the

  Features: A Clustering-based Approach",,,,,"cs.AI cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Link prediction problem has increasingly become prominent in many domains
such as social network analyses, bioinformatics experiments, transportation
networks, criminal investigations and so forth. A variety of techniques has
been developed for link prediction problem, categorized into 1) similarity
based approaches which study a set of features to extract similar nodes; 2)
learning based approaches which extract patterns from the input data; 3)
probabilistic statistical approaches which optimize a set of parameters to
establish a model which can best compute formation probability. However,
existing literatures lack approaches which utilize strength of each approach by
integrating them to achieve a much more productive one. To tackle the link
prediction problem, we propose an approach based on the combination of first
and second group methods; the existing studied works use just one of these
categories. Our two-phase developed method firstly determines new features
related to the position and dynamic behavior of nodes, which enforce the
approach more efficiency compared to approaches using mere measures. Then, a
subspace clustering algorithm is applied to group social objects based on the
computed similarity measures which differentiate the strength of clusters;
basically, the usage of local and global indices and the clustering information
plays an imperative role in our link prediction process. Some extensive
experiments held on real datasets including Facebook, Brightkite and HepTh
indicate good performances of our proposal method. Besides, we have
experimentally verified our approach with some previous techniques in the area
to prove the supremacy of ours.

algorithms also without further adjustments can tolerate a certain amount of
noise in the evaluation of the objective function. In contrast, this question
is not at all understood for multi-objective optimization.
  In this work, we conduct the first mathematical runtime analysis of a simple
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) on a classic benchmark in the
presence of noise in the objective functions. We prove that when bit-wise prior
noise with rate $p \le \alpha/n$, $\alpha$ a suitable constant, is present, the
\emph{simple evolutionary multi-objective optimizer} (SEMO) without any
adjustments to cope with noise finds the Pareto front of the OneMinMax
benchmark in time $O(n^2\log n)$, just as in the case without noise. Given that
the problem here is to arrive at a population consisting of $n+1$ individuals
witnessing the Pareto front, this is a surprisingly strong robustness to noise
(comparably simple evolutionary algorithms cannot optimize the single-objective
OneMax problem in polynomial time when $p = \omega(\log(n)/n)$). Our proofs
suggest that the strong robustness of the MOEA stems from its implicit
diversity mechanism designed to enable it to compute a population covering the
whole Pareto front.
  Interestingly this result only holds when the objective value of a solution
is determined only once and the algorithm from that point on works with this,
possibly noisy, objective value. We prove that when all solutions are
reevaluated in each iteration, then any noise rate $p = \omega(\log(n)/n^2)$
leads to a super-polynomial runtime. This is very different from
single-objective optimization, where it is generally preferred to reevaluate
solutions whenever their fitness is important and where examples are known such
that not reevaluating solutions can lead to catastrophic performance losses.

retrieval task, which has attracted increasing attention in recent years.
Different from traditional fashion retrieval which mainly focuses on optimizing
holistic similarity, the ASFR task concentrates on attribute-specific
similarity, resulting in more fine-grained and interpretable retrieval results.
As the attribute-specific similarity typically corresponds to the specific
subtle regions of images, we propose a Region-to-Patch Framework (RPF) that
consists of a region-aware branch and a patch-aware branch to extract
fine-grained attribute-related visual features for precise retrieval in a
coarse-to-fine manner. In particular, the region-aware branch is first to be
utilized to locate the potential regions related to the semantic of the given
attribute. Then, considering that the located region is coarse and still
contains the background visual contents, the patch-aware branch is proposed to
capture patch-wise attribute-related details from the previous amplified
region. Such a hybrid architecture strikes a proper balance between region
localization and feature extraction. Besides, different from previous works
that solely focus on discriminating the attribute-relevant foreground visual
features, we argue that the attribute-irrelevant background features are also
crucial for distinguishing the detailed visual contexts in a contrastive
manner. Therefore, a novel E-InfoNCE loss based on the foreground and
background representations is further proposed to improve the discrimination of
attribute-specific representation. Extensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, and also show a decent
generalization of our RPF on out-of-domain fashion images. Our source code is

disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass.
Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time
quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we
propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National
Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the
concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and
interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a
directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between
the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced.
Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time.
We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure
contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to
NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular
season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive
positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers

with limited induced drag. In this work, we use direct numerical simulations
(DNSs) to investigate the effect of the Reynolds number in a supersonic
turbulent boundary layer over a microramp vortex generator. Three friction
Reynolds numbers are considered, up to $Re_{\tau}=2000$, for fixed free-stream
Mach number $M_{\infty}=2$ and fixed relative height of the ramp with respect
to the boundary layer thickness. The high-fidelity data set sheds light on the
instantaneous and highly three-dimensional organisation of both the wake and
the shock waves induced by the microramp. The full access to the flow field
provided by DNS allows us to develop a qualitative model of the near wake,
explaining the internal convolution of the Kelvin-Helmoltz vortices around the
low-momentum region behind the ramp. The overall analysis shows that numerical
results agree excellently with recent experimental measurements in similar
operating conditions and confirms that microramps effectively induce a
significantly fuller boundary layer even far downstream of the ramp. Moreover,
results highlight significant Reynolds number effects, which in general do not
scale with the ramp height. Increasing Reynolds number leads to enhanced
coherence of the typical vortical structures in the field, faster and stronger
development of the momentum deficit region, increased upwash between the
primary vortices from the sides of the ramp - and thus increased lift-up of the
wake - and faster transfer of momentum towards the wall.

success predictor aims to estimate from prior experience the success
probability of a desired pick by the deployed industrial robotic arms in
cluttered scenes containing deformable and rigid objects with partially known
properties. It is a shallow machine learning model, which allows us to evaluate
which features are most important for the prediction. An online pick ranker
leverages the learned success predictor to prioritize the most promising picks

learned ranking process is demonstrated to overcome the limitations and
outperform the performance of manually engineered and heuristic alternatives.

is one mechanism of grain-boundary-mediated plasticity, especially in metallic
nanocrystals. This migration is due to the movement of dislocation-like
defects, called disconnections, which couple to externally applied shear
stresses. Here, we investigate a $\Sigma$19b symmetric tilt grain boundary
without pre-existing defects using atomistic computer simulations with
classical potentials. This specific grain boundary exhibits two different
atomic structures with different microscopic degrees of freedom (complexions),
called ``domino'' and ``pearl'' complexion. We show that the grain boundary
migration is affected by both the formation energy of a disconnection dipole

Natural Language Navigation. We found that current popular LLMs such as ChatGPT
still lack abilities in complex planning. This arises a question -- do the LLMs
have a good understanding of the environments described in natural language, or
maybe other alternatives such as symbolic representations are neater and hence
better to be understood by LLMs? To this end, we propose a novel method called
CoS (Chain-of-Symbol Prompting) that represents the complex environments with
condensed symbolic spatial representations during the chained intermediate

LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that CoS clearly surpasses the performance
of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting in all three planning tasks with even
fewer tokens used in the inputs compared with CoT on ChatGPT and InstructGPT.
The performance gain is strong, by up to 60.8% accuracy (from 31.8% to 92.6%)

  Approach",,,,,"quant-ph cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The approximate stabilizer rank of a quantum state is the minimum number of
terms in any approximate decomposition of that state into stabilizer states.
Bravyi and Gosset showed that the approximate stabilizer rank of a so-called
""magic"" state like $|T\rangle^{\otimes n}$, up to polynomial factors, is an
upper bound on the number of classical operations required to simulate an
arbitrary quantum circuit with Clifford gates and $n$ number of $T$ gates. As a
result, an exponential lower bound on this quantity seems inevitable. Despite
this intuition, several attempts using various techniques could not lead to a
better than a linear lower bound on the ""exact"" rank of $|T\rangle^{\otimes
n}$, meaning the minimal size of a decomposition that exactly produces the
state. However, an ""approximate"" rank is more realistically related to the cost
of simulating quantum circuits because exact rank is not robust to errors;
there are quantum states with exponentially large exact ranks but constant
approximate ranks even with arbitrarily small approximation parameters. No
lower bound better than $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt n)$ has been known for the
approximate rank. In this paper, we improve this lower bound to $\tilde \Omega
(n)$ for a wide range of the approximation parameters. Our approach is based on
a strong lower bound on the approximate rank of a quantum state sampled from
the Haar measure and a step-by-step analysis of the approximate rank of a
magic-state teleportation protocol to sample from the Haar measure.

variations of electric permittivity and diffusion constants, as well as
interfacial capacitance. Based on a time scale analysis, we derive two
approximations of the original model, namely a dynamic model for the net charge
and a leaky-dielectric model. For the leaky-dielectric model, we conduct a
detailed asymptotic analysis to demonstrate the convergence of the
diffusive-interface leaky-dielectric model to the sharp interface model as the
interface thickness approaches zero. Numerical computations are performed to
validate the asymptotic analysis and demonstrate the model's effectiveness in
handling topology changes, such as electrocoalescence. Our numerical results of
these two approximation models reveal that the polarization force, which is
induced by the spatial variation of electric permittivity in the direction
perpendicular to the external electric field, consistently dominates the
Lorentz force, which arises from the net charge. The equilibrium shape of
droplets is determined by the interplay between these two forces along the
direction of the electric field. Furthermore, in the presence of the
interfacial capacitance, a local variation of effective permittivity leads to
an accumulation of counter-ions near the interface, resulting in a reduction in
droplet deformation. Our numerical solutions also confirm that the leaky
dielectric model serves as a reasonable approximation of the original PNP-NS-CH
model when the electric relaxation time is sufficiently short. The Lorentz
force and droplet deformation both decrease when the diffusion of net charge is
significant.

The method allows us to disentangle the electron baths into independent Wilson
chains to perform standard NRG procedures beyond the widely adopted independent

reproduces the well-known even- and odd-parity channels. For 3-impurity Kondo

the helicity and the cluster spin, and clarify the false prediction of a

literature due to improper treatment of disentanglement. Our work highlights
the importance of nonlocal spatial correlations due to shared baths and reveals
a generic picture of successive collective screening for the entropy depletion

inhomogeneous Pearl length distributions. Our findings show that
inhomogeneities, specifically a shorter Pearl length in the middle of the

implications for achieving complete flux expulsion. While narrow strips have
traditionally been considered the most effective approach to improve $B_{c1}$
and eliminate trapped vortices, our results suggest that engineered
inhomogeneities offer an alternative method to enhance $B_{c1}$ and improve
flux expulsion without reducing strip width, providing greater design
flexibility for superconducting devices. Additionally, we find that for the

The enhancement in critical current arises from the current suppression effect
at the edges induced by the inhomogeneous distribution of superfluid density.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that an inhomogeneous film with a left-right
asymmetric Pearl length distribution enables control over the nonreciprocity of
the critical current, highlighting the potential of engineering inhomogeneous

the region occupied by the crystal and the bulk displacement field,

considering a discontinuous mismatch strain in the elastic energy. Since
two-dimensional methods and the methods used in the previous literature where

differently, by including in the analysis the dewetting regime and carefully

allows to establish both a compactness property in the family of admissible
configurations and the lower-semicontinuity of the energy with respect to the

predominant method. In contrastive learning, data augmentation is important to
generate different views. However, data augmentation for tabular data has been
difficult due to the unique structure and high complexity of tabular data. In

model structure, self-supervised learning methods, and data augmentation.
Therefore, previous works have compared the performance without comprehensively

Additionally, we modify parameters at various network levels, rather than just
a single layer, to increase task diversity. To account for the uncertainty
caused by the limited training tasks, we propose a variational MetaModulation
where the modulation parameters are treated as latent variables. We also
introduce learning variational feature hierarchies by the variational
MetaModulation, which modulates features at all layers and can consider task

the advantages of utilizing a learnable task modulation at different levels and
demonstrate the benefit of incorporating probabilistic variants in few-task

long and controversial history, and here we survey and expand arguments and
constructions for and against.
  We use two primary categories of QRAM from the literature: (1) active, which
requires external intervention and control for each QRAM query (e.g. the
error-corrected circuit model), and (2) passive, which requires no external
input or energy once the query is initiated. In the active model, there is a
powerful opportunity cost argument: in many applications, one could repurpose
the control hardware for the qubits in the QRAM (or the qubits themselves) to
run an extremely parallel classical algorithm to achieve the same results just
as fast. Escaping these constraints requires ballistic computation with passive
memory, which creates an array of dubious physical assumptions, which we
examine in detail. Considering these details, in everything we could find, all
non-circuit QRAM proposals fall short in one aspect or another. We apply these
arguments in detail to quantum linear algebra and prove that most asymptotic
quantum advantage disappears with active QRAM systems, with some nuance related
to the architectural assumptions.
  In summary, we conclude that cheap, asymptotically scalable passive QRAM is
unlikely with existing proposals, due to fundamental limitations that we
highlight. We hope that our results will help guide research into QRAM
technologies that attempt to circumvent or mitigate these limitations. Finally,
circuit-based QRAM still helps in many applications, and so we additionally

WIMP decays into a massive particle and radiation. We study the background
evolution and the first order perturbation theory (coupled Einstein-Boltzmann

single parameter $r=m_L/q$, which is the ratio of the lighter mass and the
comoving momentum of the decay particle. We incorporate the relevant equations

CMB angular power spectra. The decaying WIMP model is akin to a non-thermal
Warm Dark Matter(WDM) model and suppresses matter power at small scales, which
could alleviate several issues that plague the CDM model. We compare the
predictions of the model with CMB, galaxy clustering, and high-z HI data. Both

$\sigma\gtrsim 5\times 10^{-44}\,\rm cm^2$ and $m_L\gtrsim 2.4\,\rm keV$. The
lower limit on $m_L$ is comparable to constraints on the mass of
thermally-produced WDM particle. The limit on the self-annihilation
cross-section greatly expands the available parameter space as compared to the
stable WIMP scenario.

that argon is not suitable due to extensive cluster formation in the supersonic

algebraic source terms, the model is endowed with a curl constraint on the
relative velocity field. In this paper, the hyperbolicity of the system is
studied for the first time in the multidimensional case, showing that the
original model is only weakly hyperbolic in multiple space dimensions. To
restore strong hyperbolicity, two different methodologies are used: i) the
explicit symmetrization of the system, which can be achieved by adding terms
that contain linear combinations of the curl involution, similar to the
Godunov-Powell terms in the MHD equations; ii) the use of the hyperbolic
generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) curl-cleaning approach forwarded. The
PDE system is solved using a high-order ADER discontinuous Galerkin method with
a posteriori sub-cell finite volume limiter to deal with shock waves and the
steep gradients in the volume fraction commonly appearing in the solutions of
this type of model. To illustrate the performance of the method, several

In SAEM, both the users and optimiser drive the exploration. The optimiser

additionally carries prediction uncertainty information, compared to

over SO(3), it is natural to use Gaussian-like Bingham distribution and matrix
Fisher, however they are shown to be sensitive to outlier predictions, e.g.
$180^\circ$ error and thus are unlikely to converge with optimal performance.
In this paper, we draw inspiration from multivariate Laplace distribution and
propose a novel rotation Laplace distribution on SO(3). Our rotation Laplace
distribution is robust to the disturbance of outliers and enforces much
gradient to the low-error region that it can improve. In addition, we show that
our method also exhibits robustness to small noises and thus tolerates
imperfect annotations. With this benefit, we demonstrate its advantages in
semi-supervised rotation regression, where the pseudo labels are noisy. To
further capture the multi-modal rotation solution space for symmetric objects,
we extend our distribution to rotation Laplace mixture model and demonstrate
its effectiveness. Our extensive experiments show that our proposed

Adjacency Matrix (PAM) for biomedical KGs, which allows for very efficient
network analysis. PAM utilizes prime numbers to enable representing the whole

the segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach by mining
the Cross-Modal Semantics to guide the fusion and decoding of multimodal

entropy. We explore semantics among the multimodal inputs in two aspects: the
modality-shared consistency and the modality-specific variation. Specifically,
we propose a novel network, termed XMSNet, consisting of (1) all-round
attentive fusion (AF), (2) coarse-to-fine decoder (CFD), and (3) cross-layer
self-supervision. On the one hand, the AF block explicitly dissociates the
shared and specific representation and learns to weight the modal contribution
by adjusting the proportion, region, and pattern, depending upon the quality.
On the other hand, our CFD initially decodes the shared feature and then
refines the output through specificity-aware querying. Further, we enforce
semantic consistency across the decoding layers to enable interaction across
network hierarchies, improving feature discriminability. Exhaustive comparison
on eleven datasets with depth or thermal clues, and on two challenging tasks,
namely salient and camouflage object segmentation, validate our effectiveness
in terms of both performance and robustness.

Synthesis Toolchain (PCOAST), a framework for quantum circuit optimizations
based on the commutative properties of Pauli strings. Prior work has
demonstrated that commuting Clifford gates past Pauli rotations can expose
opportunities for optimization in unitary circuits. PCOAST extends that
approach by adapting the technique to mixed unitary and non-unitary circuits
via generalized preparation and measurement nodes parameterized by Pauli
strings. The result is the PCOAST graph, which enables novel optimizations
based on whether a user needs to preserve the quantum state after executing the
circuit, or whether they only need to preserve the measurement outcomes.
Finally, the framework adapts a highly tunable greedy synthesis algorithm to
implement the PCOAST graph with a given gate set.
  PCOAST is implemented as a set of compiler passes in the Intel Quantum SDK.
In this paper, we evaluate its compilation performance against two leading
quantum compilers, Qiskit and tket. We find that PCOAST reduces total gate
count by 32.53% and 43.33% on average, compared to to the best performance
achieved by Qiskit and tket respectively, two-qubit gates by 29.22% and 20.58%,

answer those questions through a case study defined based on an open-source

integrated with decision tree regression (DTR) and artificial neural network
(ANN) to construct six TL-based models, whose performances are then compared
with the baseline DTR and ANN in a proposed validation framework. The
comparisons are used to quantify the performance of applied TL methods and are
discussed from the perspective of similarity, training data size, and data

recommended. Besides, the data preprocessing should be performed carefully to
balance the modeling performance and the performance improvement due to TL.

powered by 8-10 kV, 5-10 kHz repeated pulses, allowing guided streamers to be
transferred over lengths of at least 2 m. In a first step, the catheter is
directly inserted into an artificial model reproducing the topography and the

the duodenoscope, the whole being applied to a porcine anatomical model. After
passing through the esophagus, stomach and duodenum, the distal part of the

current peaks as well as on their positive/negative value, fast ICCD imaging
distinguishes whether the guided streamers are incident, reflected or
transmitted. Combining these two techniques allow us to demonstrate
experimentally that the reflected streamers are negative contrarily to the
others. Besides, 4 types of reflections have been highlighted: a reflection (r)
at the outlet of the capillary, a reflection on the grounded surface electrode
(R) and two reflections (r' and r"") observed when an incident guided streamer
passes through the grounded annular electrode. The two techniques agree that
the characteristic propagation times are always shorter for reflected negative
streamers than for the positive ones propagating forward. Hence, for a grounded
annular electrode placed 3 cm away from the high voltage electrode, propagation
time is 80 ns for reflection versus 250 ns for transmission. These propagation
times are even shorter when the annular electrode is brought closer to the
surface electrode with velocities typically higher than 300 km/s. Finally, all
these experimental data are utilized to build an equivalent electrical model to
understand the dynamics of the guided streamers and explain their transmission
and reflection modes.

helium and powered with a high-voltage nanopulse power supply, hence generating
guided streamers. We focus on the interaction between these guided streamers
and two targets placed in a series: a metal mesh target (MM) at floating
potential followed by a metal plate target (MP) grounded by a 1500 {\Omega}
resistor. We demonstrate that such an experimental setup allows to shift from a
physics of streamer repeatability to a physics of streamer self-organization,
i.e., from the repetition of guided streamers that exhibit fixed spatiotemporal
constants to the emergence of self-organized guided streamers, each of which is
generated on the rising edge of a high-voltage pulse. Up to five positive
guided streamers can be self-organized one after the other, all distinct in
space and time. While self-organization occurs in the capillary and up to the
MM target, we also demonstrate the existence of transient emissive phenomena in
the inter-target region, especially a filamentary discharge whose generation is
directly correlated with complexity order {\Omega}. The mechanisms of the
self-organized guided streamers are deciphered by correlating their optical and
electrical properties measured by fast ICCD camera and current-voltage probes,
respectively. For the sake of clarity, special attention is paid to the case
where three self-organized guided streamers ({\alpha}, \b{eta} and {\gamma})
propagate at v{\alpha} = 75.7 km.s-1, v\b{eta} = 66.5 km.s-1 and v{\gamma} =
58.2 km.s-1), before being accelerated in the vicinity of the MM target.

LA$_1$/LA$_2$ phonon modes arising from the interlayer interaction effects and
buckling, inherent to silicene bilayer. Interestingly, the thermal conductivity
of both the mono- and bilayer silicene decreases with temperature as
$\kappa\sim T^{-0.9}$ because of the strong correlations between heat current

This approach must be contrasted with the INDIRECT detection strategies, e.g.,
based on minute exotic-physics induced changes in gravitational wave spectral
features. While our strategy seems to be overly optimistic, the numbers do work
out. The numbers work out because of (i) the exquisite sensitivity of atomic
quantum sensors and because of (ii) the enormous amounts of energy released in
the mergers. Bursts of exotic fields may, for example, be produced during the
coalescence of black hole singularities, releasing quantum gravity messengers
per the title of this contribution. To be detectable by the precision atomic
sensors, such fields must be ultralight and ultra-relativistic and we refer to
them as exotic low-mass fields (ELFs). Since the fields are massive, the group
velocity of ELF bursts is smaller than the speed of light. Thereby the ELF
bursts lag behind the gravitational waves. Then LIGO or other gravitational
wave observatories would provide a trigger for networks of precision atomic
sensors that can listen for the feeble ELF signals. We characterize ELF
signatures in the sensors. ELFs would imprint a characteristic anti-chirp
signal across the sensor network. This contribution to Moriond-Gravity

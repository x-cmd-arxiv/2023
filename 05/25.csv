BERT) pretraining, commonly adopts a random masking strategy. However, random
masking does not consider the importance of the different words in the sentence
meaning, where some of them are more worthy to be predicted. Therefore, various
masking strategies (e.g., entity-level masking) are proposed, but most of them
require expensive prior knowledge and generally train from scratch without
reusing existing model weights. In this paper, we present Self-Evolution
learning (SE), a simple and effective token masking and learning method to
fully and wisely exploit the knowledge from data. SE focuses on learning the
informative yet under-explored tokens and adaptively regularizes the training
by introducing a novel Token-specific Label Smoothing approach. Experiments on
10 tasks show that our SE brings consistent and significant improvements
(+1.43~2.12 average scores) upon different PLMs. In-depth analyses demonstrate
that SE improves linguistic knowledge learning and generalization.

the goal is to estimate a $k$-sparse mean from a collection of partially
corrupted samples drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. Existing estimators
face two critical challenges in this setting. First, they are limited by a
conjectured computational-statistical tradeoff, implying that any
computationally efficient algorithm needs $\tilde\Omega(k^2)$ samples, while
its statistically-optimal counterpart only requires $\tilde O(k)$ samples.
Second, the existing estimators fall short of practical use as they scale
poorly with the ambient dimension. This paper presents a simple mean estimator
that overcomes both challenges under moderate conditions: it runs in
near-linear time and memory (both with respect to the ambient dimension) while
requiring only $\tilde O(k)$ samples to recover the true mean. At the core of
our method lies an incremental learning phenomenon: we introduce a simple
nonconvex framework that can incrementally learn the top-$k$ nonzero elements
of the mean while keeping the zero elements arbitrarily small. Unlike existing
estimators, our method does not need any prior knowledge of the sparsity level
$k$. We prove the optimality of our estimator by providing a matching
information-theoretic lower bound. Finally, we conduct a series of simulations
to corroborate our theoretical findings. Our code is available at

Successor-Predecessor Intrinsic Exploration (SPIE), an exploration algorithm

especially for queries with complex information needs. Recent work has proposed
to improve relevance modeling by having large language models actively involved

show that strong performance can be achieved by a method we call Iter-RetGen,

output shows what might be needed to finish a task, and thus provides an
informative context for retrieving more relevant knowledge which in turn helps
generate a better output in the next iteration. Compared with recent work which
interleaves retrieval with generation when producing an output, Iter-RetGen
processes all retrieved knowledge as a whole and largely preserves the
flexibility in generation without structural constraints. We evaluate
Iter-RetGen on multi-hop question answering, fact verification, and commonsense

non-parametric knowledge, and is superior to or competitive with
state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented baselines while causing fewer overheads of

proper data analyses. In Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) has tried to
keep up with this demand for data on COVID-19, but there were (and still are)

COVID-19 in Germany, for which ideal information would be the number of
incoming patients to ICU units. This information was (and still is) not
available. Instead, the current occupancy of ICU units on the district level
was reported daily. We demonstrate how this information can be used to predict
the number of incoming as well as released COVID-19 patients using a stochastic
version of the Expectation Maximisation algorithm (SEM). This in turn, allows
for estimating the influence of district-specific and age-specific infection
rates as well as further covariates, including spatial effects, on the number
of incoming patients. The paper demonstrates that even if relevant data are not
recorded or provided officially, statistical modelling allows for
reconstructing them. This also includes the quantification of uncertainty which

a mask for the object specified by a natural language expression. Many recent
works utilize Transformer to extract features for the target object by
aggregating the attended visual regions. However, the generic attention
mechanism in Transformer only uses the language input for attention weight
calculation, which does not explicitly fuse language features in its output.
Thus, its output feature is dominated by vision information, which limits the
model to comprehensively understand the multi-modal information, and brings
uncertainty for the subsequent mask decoder to extract the output mask. To
address this issue, we propose Multi-Modal Mutual Attention ($\mathrm{M^3Att}$)
and Multi-Modal Mutual Decoder ($\mathrm{M^3Dec}$) that better fuse information
from the two input modalities. Based on {$\mathrm{M^3Dec}$}, we further propose
Iterative Multi-modal Interaction ($\mathrm{IMI}$) to allow continuous and
in-depth interactions between language and vision features. Furthermore, we
introduce Language Feature Reconstruction ($\mathrm{LFR}$) to prevent the
language information from being lost or distorted in the extracted feature.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach significantly improves
the baseline and outperforms state-of-the-art referring image segmentation
methods on RefCOCO series datasets consistently.

organic polymeric material (PM) and inorganic hybrid (HM). The FBSM provides
large area coverage, low mass profile, linear response over a broad dynamic
range, radiation tolerance, and real-time analysis IEC-compliant fast
beam-interrupt signal. This paper includes the design concept and test results
from prototype devices in radiation beams that include heavy ions, low energy
protons at nA currents, FLASH level dose per pulse electron beams, and in a
hospital radiotherapy clinic with electron beams. Results include image
quality, response linearity, radiation hardness, spatial resolution, and
real-time data processing. PM and HM scintillator exhibited no measurable drop
in signal after a cumulative dose of 9 kGy and 20 kGy respectively. HM showed a
small -0.02%/kGy signal decrease after a 212 kGy cumulative dose resulting from
continuous exposure for 15 minutes at a high FLASH dose rate of 234 Gy/s. These
tests established the linear response of the FBSM with respect to beam
currents, dose per pulse, and material thickness. Comparison with commercial
Gafchromic film indicates that the FBSM produces a high resolution 2D beam

tails. At 20 kfps or 50 microsec/frame, the real-time FPGA based computation

diagrams are obtained using the cluster mean field theory, which includes the
effect of correlations systematically. We also compute the low-energy
excitations which capture the characteristic features of such paired states and
their transitions. Apart from the gapless sound mode due to the PSF order, a
gapped mode also appears in the PSF phase, similar to the Higgs mode of the
usual atomic superfluid (ASF). The PSF to ASF transition exhibits an intriguing
behavior due to the existence of a `tri-critical' point, where the nature of
transition changes. As a consequence of the continuous PSF-ASF transition, the
gapped mode of both the phases becomes gapless at the critical point. For
sufficiently strong NNN interaction strength, a PSS phase appears with
coexisting pair superfluidity and stripe density order. The softening of the
roton mode as a precursor of density ordering and the appearance of a
low-energy gapped mode serve as robust features related to the formation of the
PSS phase. We also investigate the melting of PSF and PSS phases to normal
fluid at finite temperatures, particularly the melting pathway of PSS which
occurs in atleast two steps due to the coexisting orders. Finally, we discuss
the possibility of emulating such exotic phases in the ongoing cold atom
experiments.

visible light imagery from coronagraphs. The associated diagnostics mainly
consist of kinematics and derivations of the electron number density. While the
measurement of the properties of emission lines can provide crucial additional
diagnostics of the coronal plasma (temperatures, velocities, abundances, etc.),
these observations are comparatively rare. In visible wavelengths, observations
at these heights are limited to total eclipses. In the VUV range, very few
additional observations have been achieved since the pioneering results of
UVCS. One of the objectives of the Full Sun Imager (FSI) channel of the EUI
telescope on board the Solar Orbiter mission has been to provide very wide
field-of-view EUV diagnostics of the morphology and dynamics of the solar
atmosphere in temperature regimes that are typical of the lower transition
region and of the corona. FSI carries out observations in two narrowbands of
the EUV spectrum centered on 17.4 nm and 30.4 nm that are dominated,
respectively, by lines of Fe IX/X (formed in the corona around 1 MK) and by the
resonance line of He II (formed around 80 kK in the lower transition region).
Unlike previous EUV imagers, FSI includes a moveable occulting disk that can be
inserted in the optical path to reduce the amount of instrumental stray light
to a minimum. FSI detects signals at 17.4 nm up to the edge of its FOV (7~Rs),
which is about twice further than was previously possible. Comparisons with
observations by the LASCO and Metis coronagraphs confirm the presence of
morphological similarities and differences between the broadband visible light
and EUV emissions, as documented on the basis of prior eclipse and space-based
observations. The very-wide-field observations of FSI are paving the way for
future dedicated instruments.

spectro-polarimetric analysis we get a significant detection of polarization
(above 99% c.l.) in two out of nine phase bins and marginal detection in three

latent space of Stable Diffusion, and generates diverse novel training images
by conditioning the generative model on noisy versions of these vectors. We
identify three key components that allow our generated images to successfully
supplant the original dataset, leading to a 2-3x enhancement in sample
complexity and a 6.5x decrease in sampling time. Moreover, our approach
consistently outperforms generic prompt-based steering methods and KNN
retrieval baseline across a wide range of datasets. Additionally, we
demonstrate the compatibility of our approach with widely-used data
augmentation techniques, as well as the reliability of the generated data in
supporting various neural architectures and enhancing few-shot learning.

specified probability. In this contribution we extend this ProbLog language by
the ability to answer ""What if"" queries. Intuitively, a ProbLog program defines
a distribution by solving a system of equations in terms of mutually
independent predefined Boolean random variables. In the theory of causality,
Judea Pearl proposes a counterfactual reasoning for such systems of equations.
Based on Pearl's calculus, we provide a procedure for processing these
counterfactual queries on ProbLog programs, together with a proof of
correctness and a full implementation. Using the latter, we provide insights
into the influence of different parameters on the scalability of inference.
Finally, we also show that our approach is consistent with CP-logic, i.e. with
the causal semantics for logic programs with annotated with disjunctions.

framework and investigate difference and commonalities of quantum and classical
active matters. Although the research field of active matter has been expanding
wider and wider, most research is conducted in classical systems; on the
contrary, there is no universal theoretical framework for quantum active
matter. We here propose a truly quantum active-matter model with a
non-Hermitian quantum walk and show numerical results in one- and
two-dimensional systems. We aim to reproduce similar results that Schweitzer
\textit{et al.} obtained with their classical active Brownian particle; that
is, the Brownian particle, with a finite energy take-up, becomes active and
climbs up a potential wall. We realize such a system with non-Hermitian quantum
walks. We introduce new internal states, the ground state and the excited
state, and a new non-Hermitian operator $N(g)$ for an asymmetric transition
between both states. The non-Hermiticity parameter $g$ promotes transition to
the excited state and hence the particle takes up energy from the environment.
We realize a system without momentum conservation by manipulating a parameter
$\theta$ for the coin operator for a discrete-time quantum walk; we utilize the
property that the continuum limit of a one-dimensional discrete-time quantum
walk gives the Dirac equation with its mass proportional to the parameter
$\theta$. With our quantum active particle, we successfully observe that the
movement of the quantum walker becomes more active in a non-trivial way as we
increase the non-Hermiticity parameter $g$, which is similar to the classical
active Brownian particle. Meanwhile, we also observe unique features of quantum
walks, namely, ballistic propagation of peaks (1D) and the walker staying on
the constant energy plane (2D).

  2022 (TRL@NeurIPS2022)",,,,"cs.DB cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tabular representation learning has recently gained a lot of attention.
However, existing approaches only learn a representation from a single table,
and thus ignore the potential to learn from the full structure of relational
databases, including neighboring tables that can contain important information
for a contextualized representation. Moreover, current models are significantly
limited in scale, which prevents that they learn from large databases. In this
paper, we thus introduce our vision of relational representation learning, that
can not only learn from the full relational structure, but also can scale to
larger database sizes that are commonly found in real-world. Moreover, we also
discuss opportunities and challenges we see along the way to enable this vision
and present initial very promising results. Overall, we argue that this
direction can lead to foundation models for relational databases that are today
only available for text and images.

being acknowledged as efficacious solutions in processing elaborate graphical
information via multiple degrees of freedom, optical data encryption and
anti-counterfeiting techniques are typically inept in delivering satisfactory
performance without compromising the desired ease-of-processibility or
compatibility, thus leading to the exploration of novel materials and devices
that are competent. Here, a robust optical data encryption technique is
demonstrated utilizing polymer-stabilized-liquid-crystals (PSLCs) combined with
projection photoalignment and photopatterning methods. The PSLCs possess
implicit optical patterns encoded via photoalignment, as well as explicit
geometries produced via photopatterning. Furthermore, the PSLCs demonstrate
improved robustness against harsh chemical environments and thermal stability,
and can be directly deployed onto various rigid and flexible substrates. Based
on this, it is demonstrated that single PSLC is apt to carry intricate
information, or serve as exclusive watermark with both implicit features and
explicit geometries. Moreover, a novel, generalized design strategy is
developed, for the first time, to encode intricate and exclusive information
with enhanced security by spatially programming the photoalignment patterns of
a pair of cascade PSLCs, which further illustrates the promising capabilies of
PSLCs in optical data encryption and anti-counterfeiting.

crucial importance in aviation meteorology, as well as in water- and road
transportation. Nowadays, several meteorological services provide ensemble
forecasts of visibility; however, the skill, and reliability of visibility
predictions are far reduced compared to other variables, such as temperature or
wind speed. Hence, some form of calibration is strongly advised, which usually
means estimation of the predictive distribution of the weather quantity at hand
either by parametric or non-parametric approaches, including also machine
learning-based techniques. As visibility observations - according to the
suggestion of the World Meteorological Organization - are usually reported in
discrete values, the predictive distribution for this particular variable is a
discrete probability law, hence calibration can be reduced to a classification
problem. Based on visibility ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for
Medium-Range Weather Forecasts covering two slightly overlapping domains in
Central and Western Europe and two different time periods, we investigate the
predictive performance of locally, semi-locally and regionally trained
proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multilayer perceptron (MLP)
neural network classifiers. We show that while climatological forecasts
outperform the raw ensemble by a wide margin, post-processing results in
further substantial improvement in forecast skill and in general, POLR models
are superior to their MLP counterparts.

domains, recent works have adopted language models (LMs) as controllers of
visual modules for vision-and-language tasks. While existing work focuses on
equipping LMs with visual understanding, we propose two novel
interpretable/explainable visual programming frameworks for text-to-image (T2I)
generation and evaluation. First, we introduce VPGen, an interpretable
step-by-step T2I generation framework that decomposes T2I generation into three
steps: object/count generation, layout generation, and image generation. We
employ an LM to handle the first two steps (object/count generation and layout
generation), by finetuning it on text-layout pairs. Our step-by-step T2I
generation framework provides stronger spatial control than end-to-end models,
the dominant approach for this task. Furthermore, we leverage the world
knowledge of pretrained LMs, overcoming the limitation of previous
layout-guided T2I works that can only handle predefined object classes. We
demonstrate that our VPGen has improved control in counts/spatial
relations/scales of objects than state-of-the-art T2I generation models.
Second, we introduce VPEval, an interpretable and explainable evaluation
framework for T2I generation based on visual programming. Unlike previous T2I
evaluations with a single scoring model that is accurate in some skills but
unreliable in others, VPEval produces evaluation programs that invoke a set of
visual modules that are experts in different skills, and also provides
visual+textual explanations of the evaluation results. Our analysis shows
VPEval provides a more human-correlated evaluation for skill-specific and
open-ended prompts than widely used single model-based evaluation. We hope our
work encourages future progress on interpretable/explainable generation and
evaluation for T2I models. Website: https://vp-t2i.github.io

sources, analogous to the dipole seen in the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Measurements of source counts of large radio surveys have shown that though the
radio dipole is generally consistent in direction with the CMB dipole, the
amplitudes are in tension. These observations present an intriguing puzzle as
to the cause of this discrepancy, with a true anisotropy breaking with the
assumptions of the cosmological principle, invalidating the most common
cosmological models that are built on these assumptions. We present a novel set
of Bayesian estimators to determine the cosmic radio dipole and compare the
results with commonly used methods on the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS)
and the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) radio surveys. In addition, we adapt the
Bayesian estimators to take into account systematic effects known to affect
such large radio surveys, folding information such as the local noise floor or
array configuration directly into the parameter estimation. The enhancement of
these estimators allows us to greatly increase the amount of sources used in
the parameter estimation, yielding tighter constraints on the cosmic radio
dipole estimation than previously achieved with NVSS and RACS. We extend the
estimators further to work on multiple catalogues simultaneously, leading to a
combined parameter estimation using both NVSS and RACS. The result is a dipole
estimate that perfectly aligns with the CMB dipole in terms of direction but
with an amplitude that is three times as large, and a significance of
4.8$\sigma$. This new dipole measurement is made to an unprecedented level of
precision for radio sources, which is only matched by recent results using
infrared quasars.

to their ability to enhance educational outcomes and support stakeholders in
making informed decisions. However, predictive models can be biased and produce
unfair outcomes, leading to potential discrimination against some students and
possible harmful long-term implications. This has prompted research on fairness
metrics meant to capture and quantify such biases. Nonetheless, so far,
existing fairness metrics used in education are predictive
performance-oriented, focusing on assessing biased outcomes across groups of
students, without considering the behaviors of the models nor the severity of
the biases in the outcomes. Therefore, we propose a novel metric, the Model
Absolute Density Distance (MADD), to analyze models' discriminatory behaviors
independently from their predictive performance. We also provide a
complementary visualization-based analysis to enable fine-grained human
assessment of how the models discriminate between groups of students. We
evaluate our approach on the common task of predicting student success in
online courses, using several common predictive classification models on an
open educational dataset. We also compare our metric to the only predictive
performance-oriented fairness metric developed in education, ABROCA. Results on
this dataset show that: (1) fair predictive performance does not guarantee fair
models' behaviors and thus fair outcomes, (2) there is no direct relationship
between data bias and predictive performance bias nor discriminatory behaviors
bias, and (3) trained on the same data, models exhibit different discriminatory
behaviors, according to different sensitive features too. We thus recommend
using the MADD on models that show satisfying predictive performance, to gain a
finer-grained understanding on how they behave and to refine models selection
and their usage.

that encompass different aspects of symmetry and topology. It is debated
whether the XV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome family (where X is a rare earth element), a
recently discovered family of bilayer kagome metals, hosts a topologically
non-trivial ground state resulting from the opening of spin-orbit coupling
gaps. These states would carry a finite spin-Berry curvature, and topological
surface states. Here, we investigate the spin and electronic structure of the
XV$_6$Sn$_6$ kagome family. We obtain evidence for a finite spin-Berry
curvature contribution at the center of the Brillouin zone, where the nearly
flat band detaches from the dispersing Dirac band because of spin-orbit
coupling. In addition, the spin-Berry curvature is further investigated in the
charge density wave regime of ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, and it is found to be robust
against the onset of the temperature-driven ordered phase. Utilizing the
sensitivity of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to the spin and
orbital angular momentum, our work unveils the spin-Berry curvature of
topological kagome metals, and helps to define its spectroscopic fingerprint.

important to extend these measurements to background galaxies as quasars become
increasingly rare at high redshift and rarely probe closely separated

of the density field, we show that Ly$\alpha$ transmission is inversely
correlated with galaxy density, i.e. transparent regions in the Ly$\alpha$
forest mark under-dense regions at $z\approx4$. Due to large-scale clustering,
galaxies are surrounded by excess HI absorption over the cosmic mean out to 4
cMpc/h. We also find that redshifts from the peak of the Ly$\alpha$ line are
typically offset from the systemic redshift by +170 km/s. This work extends
results from $z\approx 2 - 3$ to higher redshifts and demonstrates the power of

foreground and unrealized backgrounds in order to cut off their co-occurring

Counterfactual-CAM, which embeds the counterfactual representation perturbation
mechanism into the vanilla CAM-based model. This mechanism is responsible for
decoupling foreground as well as background and synthesizing the counterfactual

To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in this direction. Extensive

follow the chemical enrichment of a set of putative progenitors of Terzan 5 to
assess whether the chemical properties of this cluster fit within a formation
scenario in which it is the remnant of a primordial building block of the
bulge. We can explain the metallicity distribution function and the runs of
different element-to-iron abundance ratios as functions of [Fe/H] derived from
optical-infrared spectroscopy of giant stars in Terzan 5, by assuming that the
cluster experienced two major star formation bursts separated by a long
quiescent phase. We further predict that the most metal-rich stars in Terzan 5
are moderately He-enhanced and a large spread of He abundances in the cluster,
Y = 0.26-0.335. We conclude that current observations fit within a formation
scenario in which Terzan 5 originated from a pristine, or slightly
metal-enriched, gas clump about one order of magnitude more massive than its
present-day mass. Losses of gas and stars played a major role in shaping Terzan
5 the way we see it now. The iron content of the youngest stellar population is
better explained if the white dwarfs that give rise to type Ia supernovae (the
main Fe factories) sink towards the cluster center, rather than being stripped

  Approach",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY math.PR q-fin.MF q-fin.RM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Risk sensitivity plays an important role in the study of finance and
economics as risk-neutral models cannot capture and justify all economic
behaviors observed in reality. Risk-sensitive mean field game theory was
developed recently for systems where there exists a large number of
indistinguishable, asymptotically negligible and heterogeneous risk-sensitive
players, who are coupled via the empirical distribution of state across
population. In this work, we extend the theory of Linear Quadratic Gaussian
risk-sensitive mean-field games to the setup where there exists one major agent
as well as a large number of minor agents. The major agent has a significant
impact on each minor agent and its impact does not collapse with the increase
in the number of minor agents. Each agent is subject to linear dynamics with an
exponential-of-integral quadratic cost functional. Moreover, all agents
interact via the average state of minor agents (so-called empirical mean field)
and the major agent's state. We develop a variational analysis approach to
derive the best response strategies of agents in the limiting case where the
number of agents goes to infinity. We establish that the set of obtained
best-response strategies yields a Nash equilibrium in the limiting case and an
$\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in the finite player case. We conclude the paper
with an illustrative example.

electrical insults. A prompt and accurate assessment of burns is essential for

burn assessments, via visual and tactile observations, is approximately 60%-80%
accurate. The gold standard is biopsy and a close second would be non-invasive
methods like Laser Doppler Imaging (LDI) assessments, which have up to 97%

paper, we introduce a machine learning pipeline for assessing burn severities
and segmenting the regions of skin that are affected by burn. Segmenting 2D
colour images of burns allows for the injured versus non-injured skin to be
delineated, clearly marking the extent and boundaries of the localized
burn/region-of-interest, even during remote monitoring of a burn patient. We
trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify four severities of
burns. We built a saliency mapping method, Boundary Attention Mapping (BAM),
that utilises this trained CNN for the purpose of accurately localizing and
segmenting the burn regions from skin burn images. We demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed pipeline through extensive experiments and
evaluations using two datasets; 1) A larger skin burn image dataset consisting
of 1684 skin burn images of four burn severities, 2) An LDI dataset that
consists of a total of 184 skin burn images with their associated LDI scans.
The CNN trained using the first dataset achieved an average F1-Score of 78% and
micro/macro- average ROC of 85% in classifying the four burn severities.
Moreover, a comparison between the BAM results and LDI results for measuring
injury boundary showed that the segmentations generated by our method achieved
91.60% accuracy, 78.17% sensitivity, and 93.37% specificity.

child's visual experience without any explicit supervision or domain-specific
inductive biases. Specifically, we train both embedding models and generative
models on 200 hours of headcam video from a single child collected over two

evaluate their performance in downstream tasks. The best embedding models
perform at 70% of a highly performant ImageNet-trained model on average. They
also learn broad semantic categories without any labeled examples and learn to

materials similar to FeTe$_{\text{1-x}}$Se$_\text{x}$ (FTS) along line defects
where the superconducting order parameter (OP) is phase shifted by $\pi$. Here
we show that such a $\pi$ shift in theOP across the half unit-cell shift

superconducting FTS as a result of the $s_{\pm}$ pairing symmetry across
$\Gamma$ and M pockets of FTS. The resultant inter-pocket transmission between
$\Gamma$ and M pockets is found to be typically larger than the intra-pocket
transmissions. We confirm these conclusions with a calculation based on the
Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) formalism which shows that a $\pi$-shift across the
domain-wall is favored for a large range of model parameters for FTS. We
discuss parameter regimes where this mechanism might explain the STS
experiments as well as propose to test this explanation by searching for
evidence of large inter-pocket scattering.

multi-document model from a novel cross-document question answering
pre-training objective. To that end, given a set (or cluster) of
topically-related documents, we systematically generate semantically-oriented
questions from a salient sentence in one document and challenge the model,
during pre-training, to answer these questions while ""peeking"" into other
topically-related documents. In a similar manner, the model is also challenged
to recover the sentence from which the question was generated, again while
leveraging cross-document information. This novel multi-document QA formulation
directs the model to better recover cross-text informational relations, and
introduces a natural augmentation that artificially increases the pre-training
data. Further, unlike prior multi-document models that focus on either
classification or summarization tasks, our pre-training objective formulation
enables the model to perform tasks that involve both short text generation
(e.g., QA) and long text generation (e.g., summarization). Following this
scheme, we pre-train our model -- termed QAmden -- and evaluate its performance
across several multi-document tasks, including multi-document QA,
summarization, and query-focused summarization, yielding improvements of up to
7%, and significantly outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

compelling properties. A single concept in the space-time representation is
composed of hundreds of vectors, one for each combination of time and space,
making this space challenging to optimize directly. Instead, we propose to
implicitly represent a concept in this space by optimizing a small neural
mapper that receives the current time and space parameters and outputs the
matching token embedding. In doing so, the entire personalized concept is
represented by the parameters of the learned mapper, resulting in a compact,

output of our neural mapper resides in the input space of the text encoder. We
observe that one can significantly improve the convergence and visual fidelity

additionally outputs a residual that is added to the output of the text

economy and the voltage violation penalty for safety, denoted by regulation
loss. Based on the regulation loss and prediction errors, this paper proposes
the hybrid loss and hybrid stochastic gradient descent algorithm to
back-propagate the gradients of the hybrid loss with respect to multiple

is to test their predictions for the angular clustering statistics of matter
tracers, a technique that is set to become ever more central with the next
generation of large imaging surveys. Interpretation of this clustering requires
knowledge of the projection kernel, or the redshift distribution of the
sources, and the typical assumption is an isotropic redshift distribution for
the objects. However, variations in the the kernel are expected across the
survey footprint due to photometric variations and residual observational
non-idealities. We develop the formalism for anisotropic projection and present
several limiting cases that elucidate the key aspects. We quantify the impact
of anisotropies in the redshift distribution on a general class of angular
two-point statistics. In particular, we identify a mode-coupling effect that
can add power to auto-correlations, including galaxy clustering and cosmic
shear, and remove it from certain cross-correlations. If the projection
anisotropy is primarily at large scales, the mode-coupling depends upon its
variance as a function of redshift; furthermore, it is often of similar shape
to the signal. In contrast, the cross-correlation of a field whose selection
function is anisotropic with another one featuring no such variations -- such
as CMB lensing -- is immune to these effects. We discuss explicitly several
special cases of the general formalism including galaxy clustering,
galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic shear and cross-correlations with CMB lensing,

We demonstrate there are spurious correlations in COCO Captions, the most
commonly used dataset for evaluating bias, between background context and the
gender of people in-situ. This is problematic because commonly-used bias
metrics (such as Bias@K) rely on per-gender base rates. To address this issue,
we propose a novel dataset debiasing pipeline to augment the COCO dataset with
synthetic, gender-balanced contrast sets, where only the gender of the subject
is edited and the background is fixed. However, existing image editing methods
have limitations and sometimes produce low-quality images; so, we introduce a

  Perspective","34 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CC cs.CL stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have discovered that Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT) can
dramatically improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs),
particularly when dealing with complex tasks involving mathematics or
reasoning. Despite the enormous empirical success, the underlying mechanisms
behind CoT and how it unlocks the potential of LLMs remain elusive. In this
paper, we take a first step towards theoretically answering these questions.
Specifically, we examine the expressivity of LLMs with CoT in solving
fundamental mathematical and decision-making problems. We start by giving an
impossibility result showing that bounded-depth Transformers are unable to
directly produce correct answers for basic arithmetic/equation tasks unless the
model size grows super-polynomially with respect to the input length. In
contrast, we then prove by construction that autoregressive Transformers of
constant size suffice to solve both tasks by generating CoT derivations using a
commonly-used math language format. Moreover, we show LLMs with CoT are capable
of solving a general class of decision-making problems known as Dynamic
Programming, thus justifying its power in tackling complex real-world tasks.
Finally, extensive experiments on four tasks show that, while Transformers
always fail to predict the answers directly, they can consistently learn to
generate correct solutions step-by-step given sufficient CoT demonstrations.

the Dispersive Matrix approach, a first-principle calculation of the form
factors, using no experimental data but rather only lattice QCD results as
input, was recently applied to $B \to D^{(*)}\ell\nu$. It predicts (within the
Standard Model) a much milder tension with the ${\cal R}(D^*)$ measurements
than the other form factor approaches, while at the same time giving a value of
$|V_{cb}|$ compatible with the inclusive value. However, this comes at the
expense of creating tensions with differential $B\to D^*\ell\nu$ distributions
(with light leptons). In this article, we explore the implications of using the
Dispersive Matrix method form factors, in light of the recent Belle (II)
measurements of the longitudinal polarization fraction of the $D^*$ in $B\to
D^*\ell\nu$ with light leptons, $F_L^{\ell}$, and the forward-backward
asymmetry, $A_{\rm FB}^{\ell}$. We find that the Dispersive Matrix approach
predicts a Standard Model value of $F_L^{\ell}$ that is in significant tension
with these measurements, while mild deviations in $A_{\rm FB}^{\ell}$ appear.
Furthermore, $F_L^{\ell}$ is very insensitive to New Physics such that the
latter cannot account for the tension between Dispersive Matrix predictions and
its measurement. While this tension can be resolved by deforming the original
Dispersive Matrix form factor shapes within a global fit, a tension in ${\cal
R}(D^*)$ reemerges. As this tension is milder than for the other form factors,
it can be explained by New Physics not only in the tau lepton channel but also
in the light lepton modes.

holes (BHs) were in place less than 700 Million years after the Big Bang.
However, the origin of the first BHs remains a mystery. Seeds of the first BHs
are postulated to be either light (i.e., $10-100\ \rm{M_{\odot}})$, remnants of
the first stars or heavy (i.e., $10^4-10^5\ \rm{M_{\odot}})$, originating from
the direct collapse of gas clouds. Detection of growing BHs at very early times
in the Universe (z>10) offers the cleanest method to probe seed origins.
Harnessing recent data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we report the
detection of an X-ray-luminous massive BH in a gravitationally-lensed galaxy
identified by JWST at $z\approx10.3$ behind the cluster lens Abell 2744.
Combining Chandra and JWST observations, we can now witness the growth of the
very first BHs and measure the properties of their host galaxies. This
heavily-obscured quasar with a bolometric luminosity of $L_{\rm

comparable to the inferred stellar mass of its host galaxy, in contrast to what
is found in the local Universe wherein the BH mass is $\sim$0.1% of the host
galaxy's stellar mass. The combination of such a high BH mass and large
BH-to-galaxy stellar mass ratio just $\sim$500 Myrs after the Big Bang was
theoretically predicted and is consistent with a picture wherein such BHs
originated from heavy seeds.

significant, potentially detectable gradients aligned with the transverse

that this signal is sufficiently prominent to be detected in future Cosmic

be found in all generality outside the customary standard QCD band, with QCD
being the sole source of Peccei-Quinn breaking. The essential reason is that
the basis of axion-gluon interactions does not need to coincide with the mass
basis. Specifically, we consider the case in which the QCD axion field is not
the only singlet scalar in Nature but it mixes with other singlet scalars
(besides the $\eta'$). We determine the exact mathematical condition for an
arbitrary $N$-scalar potential to be Peccei-Quinn invariant. Such potentials
provide extra sources of mass for the customary axion without enlarging the
Standard Model gauge symmetry. The contribution to the axion mass stemming from
the QCD topological susceptibility is shown to be shared then among the $N$
axion eigenstates through a precise sum rule. Their location can only be
displaced to the right of the standard QCD band. We demonstrate that the axion
closest to this band can be displaced from it by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ at
most, and this corresponds to the case in which all axion signals are maximally
deviated. Conversely, if one axion is found on the standard QCD band, the other
eigenstates will be out of experimental reach. Our results imply that any ALP
experiment which finds a signal outside the standard QCD axion band can be
solving the strong CP problem within QCD, with the associated $N-1$ excitations
to be found in an area of parameter space that we determine. We illustrate the

new (Gaussian) approximation of the hopping parameter, we demonstrate the
renormalization of the phonon frequency and the consequent collapse of the $H$

the collapsed phonon at $H$. Through comparisons with experimental data, we

introduced in S. Ganeshan et al.,[ Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 146601 (2015)], is
known analytically to possess a mobility edge, allowing both extended and
localized eigenstates to coexist. This mobility edge has been hypothesized to
survive in closed many-body interacting systems, giving rise to a new
non-ergodic metallic phase. In this work, coupling the interacting GPD model to
a thermal bath, we provide direct numerical evidence for multiple qualitative
behaviors in the parameter space of disorder strength and energy level. In
particular, we look at the bath-induced saturation of entanglement entropy to
classify three behaviors: thermalized, non-ergodic extended, and localized. We
also extract the localization length in the localized phase using the long-time
dynamics of the entanglement entropy and the spin imbalance. Our work
demonstrates the rich localization landscape of generalized Aubry-Andr\'e
models containing mobility edges in contrast to the simple Aubry-Andr\'e model
with no mobility edge.

and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon

in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy,
depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same
time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of
complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate
the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits,
where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are
individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that
the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase
transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement
rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a
value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed
$\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to
find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run
below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is
reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state
complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from
algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase
transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior
of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the
computational power of measurements in many-body systems.

million in the Archean Eon, to a fraction of a percent in the Proterozoic, and
finally to modern levels during the Phanerozoic. The ozone layer formed with
the early Proterozoic oxygenation. While oxygen itself has only minor radiative
and climatic effects, the accompanying ozone has important consequences for
Earth climate. Using the Community Earth System Model (CESM), a 3-D general
circulation model, we test the effects of various levels of ozone on Earth's
climate. When CO2 is held constant, the global mean surface temperature
decreases with decreasing ozone, with a maximum drop of ~3.5 K at near total
ozone removal. By supplementing our GCM results with 1-D radiative flux
calculations, we are able to test which changes to the atmosphere are
responsible for this temperature change. We find that the surface temperature
change is caused mostly by the stratosphere being much colder when ozone is
absent; this makes it drier, substantially weakening the greenhouse effect. We
also examine the effect of the structure of the upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere on the formation of clouds, and on the global circulation. At low
ozone, both high and low clouds become more abundant, due to changes in the
tropospheric stability. These generate opposing short-wave and long-wave
radiative forcings that are nearly equal. The Hadley circulation and
tropospheric jet streams are strengthened, while the stratospheric polar jets
are weakened, the latter being a direct consequence of the change in
stratospheric temperatures. This work identifies the major climatic impacts of
ozone, an important piece of the evolution of Earth's atmosphere.

characterized by integrability, transient chaos, and steady-state chaos. Most
of the cases characterized by quantum chaos become integrable in the mean-field

charges can fail to commute. Noncommutation invites generalizations, which we

(i.e., simultaneous, in-phase) pulsing of both power sources in a dual
frequency capacitively coupled plasma is examined in this article. Due to the
low gas pressure, modeling has been done using the electrostatic
Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision method. The objective of this work is to
investigate the sensitivity of the plasma properties to small changes in timing
during synchronous pulsing of the 2 RF sources. It is demonstrated that small
deviations in the on and off times of the 2 RF sources can lead to major
changes in the plasma characteristics. This high sensitivity is of concern for
process repeatability but can be utilized to enable better control of the
dynamics of plasma-surface interaction. In the simulations, the pulsing
parameters (on and off times and ramp rates) are varied and the temporal
evolution of plasma characteristics such as electron density (ne), species
current at the electrode, and electron temperature are examined. It is
demonstrated that if the low-frequency (LF) source is turned off a few {\mu}s
before (or after) the high-frequency source, ne during the off-state is
significantly higher (or lower) due to the frequency coupling effect.
Similarly, turning on the LF source with a small delay results in a sharp
increase in the plasma density when the RF sources are turned on.

prevails in post-inflationary axion models with discrete symmetry. Such

the birth of domain walls when the QCD potential switches on. We discuss

variables for linear stationary objects operating under conditions of noise or
disturbances in the measurement channel. The paper considers a fully observable
linear stationary system with known parameters. It is assumed that the state
variables are not measured, and the measured output variable contains a small
amplitude (in general, modulo less than one) additive noise or disturbance. It
is also assumed that there is no a priori information about the disturbance or
noise in the measurement channel (for example, frequency spectrum, covariance,
etc.). It is well known that a large number of methods of observer synthesis
have been obtained for this type of objects, including the Kalman filter, which
has proven itself in practice. Under the condition of complete observability
and the presence of some a priori information about the process (which is
typical for the case when a disturbance in the measurement channel can be
represented as white noise), approaches based on Kalman filtering demonstrate
the highest quality of convergence of estimates of state variables to true
values. Without taking into account the numerous results obtained using the
application of the Kalman filter, an alternative idea of constructing an
observer of state variables is considered in this paper. The alternative of the
new approach is primarily due to the fact that there is no need to use the
usual approaches based on the Luenberger observer. The paper proposes an
approach based on the evaluation of unknown parameters (in this case, an
unknown vector of initial conditions of the variables of the object state) of a
linear regression model.

Recommender systems today capture users' interests through encoding their
historical activities on the platforms. The generated user representations are
hard to examine or interpret. On the other hand, if we were to ask people about
interests they pursue in their life, they might talk about their hobbies, like
I just started learning the ukulele, or their relaxation routines, e.g., I like
to watch Saturday Night Live, or I want to plant a vertical garden. We argue,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments, that LLMs as foundation models
can reason through user activities, and describe their interests in nuanced and
interesting ways, similar to how a human would.
  We define interest journeys as the persistent and overarching user interests,
in other words, the non-transient ones. These are the interests that we believe
will benefit most from the nuanced and personalized descriptions. We introduce
a framework in which we first perform personalized extraction of interest
journeys, and then summarize the extracted journeys via LLMs, using techniques
like few-shot prompting, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning. Together, our results
in prompting LLMs to name extracted user journeys in a large-scale industrial

interpretable, and controllable user understanding. We believe LLM powered user

networks, where a model is allowed to abstain from low-confidence predictions
to avoid potential errors. Specifically, we tackle the problem of optimizing
the confidence estimator of a fixed classifier, aiming to enhance its
misclassification detection performance, i.e., its ability to discriminate
between correct and incorrect predictions by assigning higher confidence values
to the correct ones. Previous work has found that different classifiers exhibit
varying levels of misclassification detection performance, particularly when
using the maximum softmax probability (MSP) as a measure of confidence.
However, we argue that these findings are mainly due to a sub-optimal
confidence estimator being used for each model. To overcome this issue, we
propose a simple and efficient post-hoc confidence estimator, named
$p$-NormSoftmax, which consists of transforming the logits through $p$-norm
normalization and temperature scaling, followed by taking the MSP, where $p$
and the temperature are optimized based on a hold-out set. This estimator can
be easily applied on top of an already trained model and, in many cases, can
significantly improve its selective classification performance. When applied to
84 pretrained Imagenet classifiers, our method yields an average improvement of
16% in the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC), exceeding 40% for some
models. Furthermore, after applying $p$-NormSoftmax, we observe that these
models exhibit approximately the same level of misclassification detection
performance, implying that a model's selective classification performance is
almost entirely determined by its accuracy at full coverage.

a wind turbine by means of a Langevin equation has been well established. For
this approach, temporally highly resolved measurements of wind speed and power
output are used to obtain the drift and diffusion coefficients of the energy
conversion process. These coefficients fully determine a Langevin stochastic
differential equation with Gaussian white noise. The drift term specifies the
deterministic behavior of the system whereas the diffusion term describes the
stochastic behavior of the system. A precise estimation of these coefficients
is essential to understand the dynamics of the power conversion process of the
wind turbine. We show that the dynamics of the power output of a wind turbine
have a hidden dependency on turbine's different operational states. Here, we
use an approach based on clustering Pearson correlation matrices for different
observables on a moving time window to identify different operational states.
We have identified five operational states in total, for example the state of
rated power. Those different operational states distinguish non-stationary
behavior in the mutual dependencies and represent different turbine control
settings. As a next step, we condition our Langevin analysis on these different
states to reveal distinctly different behaviors of the power conversion process
for each operational state. Moreover, in our new representation hysteresis
effects which have typically appeared in the Langevin dynamics of wind turbines
seem to be resolved. We assign these typically observed hysteresis effects
clearly to the change of the wind energy system between our estimated different
operational states. In this contribution, we discuss further consequences for

surfaces. As another application of this framework, we give explicit
parametrizations of a class of rotational constant harmonic mean curvature
surfaces in hyperbolic space. In doing so, we close the last gaps in the
classification of all channel linear Weingarten surfaces in space forms,
started in Hertrich-Jeromin et all (2023).

  Models",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent years have witnessed the emergence of textual commonsense knowledge
bases, aimed at providing more nuanced and context-rich knowledge. The
integration of external commonsense into language models has been shown to be a
key enabler in advancing the state-of-the-art for a wide range of NLP tasks.
However, incorporating textual commonsense descriptions is computationally
expensive, as compared to encoding conventional symbolic knowledge. In this
paper, we propose a method to improve its efficiency without modifying the
model. We group training samples with similar commonsense descriptions into a
single batch, thus reusing the encoded description across multiple samples. One
key observation is that the upper bound of batch partitioning can be reduced to
the classic {\it graph k-cut problem}. Consequently, we propose a spectral
clustering-based algorithm to solve this problem. Extensive experiments
illustrate that the proposed batch partitioning approach effectively reduces
the computational cost while preserving performance. The efficiency improvement
is more pronounced on larger datasets and on devices with more memory capacity,
attesting to its practical utility for large-scale applications.

accreted and disrupted by the tidal field of the Milky Way. Recent observations
have shown that the central region of the dwarf hosts at least three different
stellar populations, ranging from old and metal-poor over intermediate
metal-rich to young metal-rich. While the intermediate-age metal-rich
population has been identified as part of the galaxy, the oldest and youngest
populations belong to M54, the nuclear star cluster (NSC) of the Sgr dSph
galaxy. The old metal-poor component of M54 has been interpreted as at least
one decayed GC which was initially orbiting its host galaxy. The youngest
population formed in situ from gas accreted into M54 after its arrival at the
centre of the host. In this work, we use the observed properties of M54 to
explore the shape of the inner density profile of the Sgr dSph galaxy. To do
so, we simulate the decay of M54 towards the centre of the dark matter (DM)
halo of its host. We model the DM density profile using different central
slopes, and we compare the results of the simulations to the most recent
observations of the structural properties of M54. From this comparison, we
conclude that a GC that decays in a DM halo with a density profile $\propto
r^{-\gamma}$ and $\gamma \leq 1$ shows a rotational signal and flattening
comparable to those observed for M54. Steeper profiles produce, instead, highly
rotating and more flattened NSCs which do not match the properties of M54.

because few systematic evaluations have been reported. We empirically evaluated
QBA impact on odds ratios (OR) in several comparative effect estimation

synthesized an analytic space defined by outcome incidence, uncorrected ORs,

[(OR-ORQBA)]/OR*100%]. Results were considered invalid if any contingency table
cell was corrected to a negative number. Empirical bias correction was greatest
in lower incidence scenarios where uncorrected ORs were larger. Similarly,
synthetic bias correction was greater in lower incidence settings with larger

graph-based learning problem, such as credit risk assessment in financial

predicted target samples while leaving model predictions unchanged on unrelated
samples, has garnered significant interest in the fields of computer vision and
natural language processing. However, model editing for graph neural networks
(GNNs) is rarely explored, despite GNNs' widespread applicability. To fill the
gap, we first observe that existing model editing methods significantly
deteriorate prediction accuracy (up to $50\%$ accuracy drop) in GNNs while a
slight accuracy drop in multi-layer perception (MLP). The rationale behind this
observation is that the node aggregation in GNNs will spread the editing effect
throughout the whole graph. This propagation pushes the node representation far
from its original one. Motivated by this observation, we propose
\underline{E}ditable \underline{G}raph \underline{N}eural \underline{N}etworks
(EGNN), a neighbor propagation-free approach to correct the model prediction on
misclassified nodes. Specifically, EGNN simply stitches an MLP to the
underlying GNNs, where the weights of GNNs are frozen during model editing. In
this way, EGNN disables the propagation during editing while still utilizing
the neighbor propagation scheme for node prediction to obtain satisfactory
results. Experiments demonstrate that EGNN outperforms existing baselines in
terms of effectiveness (correcting wrong predictions with lower accuracy drop),
generalizability (correcting wrong predictions for other similar nodes), and
efficiency (low training time and memory) on various graph datasets.

mass star T CrA. The aim is to better understand the origin of the [O I] and [S
II] emission from T CrA and further explore the usefulness of
spectro-astrometry to the search for a reliable tracer of MHD disk winds. The
analysis reveals a small-scale curved jet in an east-west direction and
inclined parallel to the plane of the sky. It is the inclination of this jet
which led to the classification of the forbidden emission lines as a
low-velocity component. Thus spectro-astrometry highlights here that for close
to edge-on disks spatial information is necessary. The position angle of the
jet is not perpendicular to the position angle of the accretion disk nor does
it agree with older observations of outflows likely driven by T CrA. The mass
outflow rate of 5 - 10 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ \Msun/yr is within the range for
intermediate mass stars. We conclude that more than one outflow is driven by
the T CrA system and that the curvature seen in the first detection of an
outflow from T CrA and in the data presented here is likely due to the
multiplicity of the system.

A large number of CFD software packages are available, but are typically based
on rigid domains and low-order finite volume methods, and are often implemented
in massive low-level C++ libraries. Furthermore, only a handful of solvers have
been appropriately verified and validated for their intended use. Our goal was
to develop, verify and validate an open-source CFD solver for moving domains,
with applications to cardiovascular flows. The solver is an extension of the
CFD solver Oasis, which is based on the finite element method and implemented
using the FEniCS open source framework. The new solver, named OasisMove,
extends Oasis by expressing the Navier-Stokes equations in the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, which is suitable for handling moving domains.
For code verification we used the method of manufactured solutions for a moving
2D vortex problem, and for validation we compared our results against existing
high-resolution simulations and laboratory experiments for two moving domain
problems of varying complexity. Verification results showed that the $L_2$
error followed the theoretical convergence rates. The temporal accuracy was
second-order, while the spatial accuracy was second- and third-order using
P1/P1 and P2/P1 finite elements, respectively. Validation results showed good
agreement with existing benchmark results, by reproducing lift and drag
coefficients with less than 1% error, and demonstrating the solver's ability to
capture vortex patterns in transitional and turbulent-like flow regimes. In
conclusion, we have shown that OasisMove is an open-source, accurate and
reliable solver for cardiovascular flows in moving domains.

interacts nonlocally with all other bath spins. These systems show complex
stationary phenomena and very distinct dynamical regimes which, despite the
collective nature of the interaction, are still largely not understood. Here,
we derive exact analytical results on the emergent dynamical behavior of open
quantum central spin systems. The latter crucially depends on the scaling of
the interaction strength with the bath size. For scalings with the inverse
square root of the bath size (typical of one-to-many interactions), the system
behaves, in the thermodynamic limit, as an open quantum (spin-boson)
Jaynes-Cummings model, whose bosonic mode encodes the quantum fluctuations of
the bath spins. In this regime, non-Gaussian correlations are dynamically
generated and persist at stationarity. For scalings with the inverse bath size,
the emergent dynamics is instead of mean-field type. Our work provides a
fundamental understanding of the different dynamical regimes of central spin
systems and opens up the possibility of efficiently exploring their
nonequilibrium behavior. It further highlights a non-mean-field theory that may
become relevant for open quantum many-body systems in general.

demonstrated by the algebraic stability theorem, decomposition of
multiparameter modules is well known to be unstable in a certain precise sense.
Until now, it has not been clear that there is any way to build a meaningful
stability theory for multiparameter module decomposition, as naive attempts to
do this tend to fail. We introduce tools and definitions, in particular
$\epsilon$-refinements and the $\epsilon$-erosion neighborhood of a module, to
make sense of the question of how to build such a theory. Then we show a
stability theorem saying that $\epsilon$-interleaved modules with maximal
pointwise dimension $r$ have a common $2r\epsilon$-refinement, which can be
interpreted as an approximate $2r\epsilon$-matching of indecomposables. We also
show that the $2r\epsilon$ appearing in the theorem is close to optimal.
Finally, we discuss the possibility of strengthening the stability theorem for
modules that decompose into pointwise low-dimensional summands, and pose a
conjecture phrased purely in terms of basic linear algebra and graph theory
that seems to capture the difficulty of doing this. This conjecture is also
relevant for other areas of multipersistence, like the computational complexity

intervention that increases the network plasticity without changing the number
of trainable parameters or biasing the predictions. The applications of this
intervention are two-fold: first, as a diagnostic tool $\unicode{x2014}$ if
injection increases the performance, we may conclude that an agent's network
was losing its plasticity. This tool allows us to identify a subset of Atari
environments where the lack of plasticity causes performance plateaus,
motivating future studies on understanding and combating plasticity loss.
Second, plasticity injection can be used to improve the computational
efficiency of RL training if the agent has to re-learn from scratch due to
exhausted plasticity or by growing the agent's network dynamically without
compromising performance. The results on Atari show that plasticity injection
attains stronger performance compared to alternative methods while being

Then, after the client requests are observed, jobs may be transferred from one

the original private data without leaking sensitive user information is a
scalable way to mitigate privacy concerns in the current data-driven world. In
contrast to current practices that train customized models for this task, we
aim to generate DP Synthetic Data via APIs (DPSDA), where we treat foundation
models as blackboxes and only utilize their inference APIs. Such API-based,
training-free approaches are easier to deploy as exemplified by the recent
surge in the number of API-based apps. These approaches can also leverage the
power of large foundation models which are accessible via their inference APIs
while the model weights are unreleased. However, this comes with greater
challenges due to strictly more restrictive model access and the additional
need to protect privacy from the API provider.
  In this paper, we present a new framework called Private Evolution (PE) to
solve this problem and show its initial promise on synthetic images.
Surprisingly, PE can match or even outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
without any model training. For example, on CIFAR10 (with ImageNet as the
public data), we achieve FID<=7.9 with privacy cost epsilon=0.67, significantly
improving the previous SOTA from epsilon=32. We further demonstrate the promise
of applying PE on large foundation models such as Stable Diffusion to tackle
challenging private datasets with a small number of high-resolution images.

and powerful tools for studying critical and scaling phenomena in interacting

computation has had a significant breakthrough in both static and dynamic
models of critical behavior. In the paper, we focus on the state-of-the-art
computational techniques for critical dynamic diagrams and the results obtained
with their help. The generic nature of the evaluated physical observables in a
wide class of field models is manifested in the asymptotic character of
perturbation expansions. Thus, the Borel resummation of series is required to
process multiloop results. Such a procedure also enables one to take high-order
contributions into consideration properly. The paper outlines the resummation
framework in dynamic models and the circumstances in which it can be useful. An
important resummation criterion is the properties of the higher-order
asymptotics of the perturbation theory. In static theories, these properties
are determined by the method of instanton analysis. A similar approach is
applicable in critical dynamics models. We describe the calculation of these
asymptotics in dynamical models and present the results of the corresponding
resummation.

graph given a set of input conditions. Many previous studies employ
autoregressive models to incrementally generate graph components such as nodes
and edges. However, as graphs typically lack a natural ordering among their
components, converting a graph into a sequence of tokens is not
straightforward. While prior works mostly rely on conventional heuristics or
graph traversal methods like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search
(DFS) to convert graphs to sequences, the impact of ordering on graph
generation has largely been unexplored. This paper contributes to this problem
by: (1) highlighting the crucial role of ordering in autoregressive graph
generation models, (2) proposing a novel theoretical framework that perceives
ordering as a dimensionality reduction problem, thereby facilitating a deeper
understanding of the relationship between orderings and generated graph
accuracy, and (3) introducing ""latent sort,"" a learning-based ordering scheme
to perform dimensionality reduction of graph tokens. Our experimental results
showcase the effectiveness of latent sort across a wide range of graph
generation tasks, encouraging future works to further explore and develop
learning-based ordering schemes for autoregressive graph generation.

start by considering what is arguably the most fundamental setting. In this
setting the online algorithm observes a sequence of prices one after the other.
At each time step, the online algorithm can decide to buy and pay the current
price if it does not hold the item already; or it can decide to sell and
collect the current price as a reward if it holds the item.
  We show that for i.i.d. prices a single-threshold online algorithm achieves
at least $1/2$ of the expected profit of the optimal offline algorithm and we
prove that this is optimal. For non-i.i.d. prices in random order, where prices
are no longer independent, we give a single-threshold online algorithm that
achieves at least a $1/16$ fraction of the expected profit of the optimal
offline algorithm. We also show that for this setting no online algorithm can
yield a better than $1/3$ approximation, and thus establish a formal separation
from the i.i.d. case. On the other hand, we present a threshold-based online
algorithm for this setting that yields a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation. For
non-i.i.d. prices no approximation is possible.
  We use the results for these base cases to solve a variety of more complex
settings. For instance, we show a $1/2-o(1)$ approximation for settings where
prices are affiliated and the online algorithm has only access to a single
sample. We also extend our upper and lower bounds for the single item case to
$k$ items, and thus in particular show that it is impossible to achieve
$1-o(1)$ approximations. For the budgeted version, where fractions of an item
can be bought, and gains can be reinvested, we show a constant-factor
approximation to the optimal offline algorithm's growth rate. In a setting with
$k$ item types and price streams, we achieve a $\Omega(1/k)$ approximation for
the unit-capacity case, which is optimal.

(e.g., language, channel, demographic) in which a system is deployed to differ
from that in which a system has been trained. To close the resulting gap,
domain adaptation is often essential for PLDA models. Among two of its variants
are Heavy-tailed PLDA (HT-PLDA) and Gaussian PLDA (G-PLDA). Though the former
better fits real feature spaces than does the latter, its popularity has been
severely limited by its computational complexity and, especially, by the
difficulty, it presents in domain adaptation, which results from its
non-Gaussian property. Various domain adaptation methods have been proposed for
G-PLDA. This paper proposes a generalized framework for domain adaptation that
can be applied to both of the above variants of PLDA for speaker recognition.
It not only includes several existing supervised and unsupervised domain
adaptation methods but also makes possible more flexible usage of available
data in different domains. In particular, we introduce here two new techniques:
(1) correlation-alignment in the model level, and (2) covariance
regularization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposed
application of such techniques for domain adaptation w.r.t. HT-PLDA. The
efficacy of the proposed techniques has been experimentally validated on NIST

sense active-source and passive-wavefield stress waves. The active-source data

on processing the data for detecting anomalies or generating subsurface 2D/3D
imaging results. The raw and processed data, along with detailed documentation
of the experiment and Python tools to aid in visualizing the DAS dataset have
been archived and made publicly available on DesignSafe under project PRJ-3521.

model selection uncertainty into account. The first is a straightforward
extension of asymptotic normality results and the second includes an extra
optimization that improves nominal coverage for small-to--moderate samples.
Both PI's are wider than would be obtained without incorporating model
selection uncertyainty. We compare these two PI's with three other PI's. Two
are based on bootstrapping procedures and the third is based on a PI from Bayes
model averaging. We argue that for general usage either the asymptotic
normality or optimized asymptotic normality PI's work best. In an Appendix we
extend our results to Generalized Linear Mixed Models.

mesons in $pp$ collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ is studied using LHCb data, corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of $4\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The measurement is performed
for $J/\psi$ ($\mathit{\Upsilon}$) mesons with a transverse momentum
$p_{\mathrm{T}}<10\,(30)\,\mathrm{GeV}/c$ in the rapidity range $2.0<y<4.5$. In
this kinematic range, the cross-section of the associated production of prompt
$J/\psi$ and $\mathit{\Upsilon}(1S)$ mesons is measured to be $133 \pm 22 \pm 7
\pm 3 \, \mathrm{pb}$, with a significance of $7.9\,\sigma$, and that of prompt
$J/\psi$ and $\mathit{\Upsilon}(2S)$ mesons to be $76\pm 21 \pm 4 \pm 7 \,
\mathrm{pb}$, with a significance of $4.9\,\sigma$. The first uncertainty is
statistical, the second systematic, and the third due to uncertainties on the
used branching fractions. This is the first observation of the associated
production of $J/\psi$ and $\mathit{\Upsilon}(1S)$ in proton-proton collisions.
Differential cross-sections are measured as function of variables that are
sensitive to kinematic correlations between the $J/\psi$ and
$\mathit{\Upsilon}(1S)$ mesons. The effective cross-sections of the associated
production of prompt $J/\psi$ and $\mathit{\Upsilon}$ mesons are obtained and
found to be compatible with measurements using other particle productions.

often indistinguishable from real images. To generate such images, these models
must understand the semantics of the objects they are asked to generate. In
this work we show that, without any training, one can leverage this semantic
knowledge within diffusion models to find semantic correspondences -- locations
in multiple images that have the same semantic meaning. Specifically, given an
image, we optimize the prompt embeddings of these models for maximum attention
on the regions of interest. These optimized embeddings capture semantic
information about the location, which can then be transferred to another image.
By doing so we obtain results on par with the strongly supervised state of the
art on the PF-Willow dataset and significantly outperform (20.9% relative for
the SPair-71k dataset) any existing weakly or unsupervised method on PF-Willow,
CUB-200 and SPair-71k datasets.

  Multi-Style Text Transfer",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Text style transfer is an exciting task within the field of natural language
generation that is often plagued by the need for high-quality paired datasets.
Furthermore, training a model for multi-attribute text style transfer requires
datasets with sufficient support across all combinations of the considered
stylistic attributes, adding to the challenges of training a style transfer
model. This paper explores the impact of training data input diversity on the
quality of the generated text from the multi-style transfer model. We construct
a pseudo-parallel dataset by devising heuristics to adjust the style
distribution in the training samples. We balance our training dataset using
marginal and joint distributions to train our style transfer models. We observe
that a balanced dataset produces more effective control effects over multiple
styles than an imbalanced or skewed one. Through quantitative analysis, we
explore the impact of multiple style distributions in training data on
style-transferred output. These findings will better inform the design of
style-transfer datasets.

process characteristically requires numerous, potentially hundreds, of
iterative steps, which could lead to the problem of exposure bias due to the
accumulation of prediction errors over iterations. Previous work has attempted
to mitigate this issue by perturbing inputs during training, which consequently
mandates the retraining of the DDPM. In this work, we conduct a systematic
study of exposure bias in diffusion models and, intriguingly, we find that the
exposure bias could be alleviated with a new sampling method, without
retraining the model. We empirically and theoretically show that, during
inference, for each backward time step $t$ and corresponding state $\hat{x}_t$,
there might exist another time step $t_s$ which exhibits superior coupling with
$\hat{x}_t$. Based on this finding, we introduce an inference method named
Time-Shift Sampler. Our framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing
sampling algorithms, such as DDIM or DDPM, inducing merely minimal additional
computations. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can
effectively enhance the quality of images generated by existing sampling
algorithms.

conditions and tasks. Most current LL is limited to a single agent that learns
tasks sequentially. Dedicated LL machinery is then deployed to mitigate the
forgetting of old tasks as new tasks are learned. This is inherently slow. We
propose a new Shared Knowledge Lifelong Learning (SKILL) challenge, which
deploys a decentralized population of LL agents that each sequentially learn
different tasks, with all agents operating independently and in parallel. After
learning their respective tasks, agents share and consolidate their knowledge
over a decentralized communication network, so that, in the end, all agents can
master all tasks. We present one solution to SKILL which uses Lightweight
Lifelong Learning (LLL) agents, where the goal is to facilitate efficient
sharing by minimizing the fraction of the agent that is specialized for any
given task. Each LLL agent thus consists of a common task-agnostic immutable
part, where most parameters are, and individual task-specific modules that
contain fewer parameters but are adapted to each task. Agents share their
task-specific modules, plus summary information (""task anchors"") representing
their tasks in the common task-agnostic latent space of all agents. Receiving
agents register each received task-specific module using the corresponding
anchor. Thus, every agent improves its ability to solve new tasks each time new
task-specific modules and anchors are received. On a new, very challenging
SKILL-102 dataset with 102 image classification tasks (5,033 classes in total,

sensitivity of data contained in prompts raises privacy concerns. Our work
first shows that these concerns are valid: we instantiate a simple but highly
effective membership inference attack against the data used to prompt LLMs. To
address this vulnerability, one could forego prompting and resort to
fine-tuning LLMs with known algorithms for private gradient descent. However,
this comes at the expense of the practicality and efficiency offered by
prompting. Therefore, we propose to privately learn to prompt. We first show
that soft prompts can be obtained privately through gradient descent on
downstream data. However, this is not the case for discrete prompts. Thus, we
orchestrate a noisy vote among an ensemble of LLMs presented with different
prompts, i.e., a flock of stochastic parrots. The vote privately transfers the
flock's knowledge into a single public prompt. We show that LLMs prompted with
our private algorithms closely match the non-private baselines. For example,
using GPT3 as the base model, we achieve a downstream accuracy of 92.7% on the
sst2 dataset with ($\epsilon=0.147, \delta=10^{-6}$)-differential privacy vs.
95.2% for the non-private baseline. Through our experiments, we also show that

routing problem: given a network, a set of agents occupying a subset of its

to the constraint that each task is visited by some agent at least once. The
classical version of this problem assumes a central computational server that
observes the entire state of the system perfectly and directs individual agents
according to a centralized control scheme. In contrast, we assume that there is
no centralized server and that each agent is an individual processor with no a
priori knowledge of the underlying network (including task and agent
locations). Moreover, our agents possess strictly local communication and
sensing capabilities (restricted to a fixed radius around their respective
locations), aligning more closely with several real-world multiagent
applications. These restrictions introduce many challenges that are overcome
through local information sharing and direct coordination between agents. We
present a fully distributed, online, and scalable reinforcement learning
algorithm for this problem whereby agents self-organize into local clusters and
independently apply a multiagent rollout scheme locally to each cluster. We
demonstrate empirically via extensive simulations that there exists a critical
sensing radius beyond which the distributed rollout algorithm begins to improve
over a greedy base policy. This critical sensing radius grows proportionally to
the $\log^*$ function of the size of the network, and is, therefore, a small
constant for any relevant network. Our decentralized reinforcement learning
algorithm achieves approximately a factor of two cost improvement over the base
policy for a range of radii bounded from below and above by two and three times
the critical sensing radius, respectively.

Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed approach is investigated in the

initial state sampling, and state reset procedures. This incorporation of CIS
facilitates improved sampling efficiency during the offline training process.
In the online stage, RL is retrained whenever the predicted next step state is

Safety Supervisor to examine the safety of the action and make necessary
corrections. The stability analysis is conducted for both cases, with and

minimum-energy configuration of a set of point-like electrons that are confined
to the surface of a two-dimensional sphere (${\cal S}^2$) that repel each other
according to Coulomb's law, in which the distance is the Euclidean distance in
the embedding space of the sphere, {\em i.e.}, $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this work, we
consider the analogous problem where the electrons are confined to an
$n$-dimensional flat Clifford torus ${\cal T}^n$ with $n = 1, 2, 3$. Since the
torus ${\cal T}^n$ can be embedded in the complex manifold $\mathbb{C}^n$, we
define the distance in the Coulomb law as the Euclidean distance in
$\mathbb{C}^n$, in analogy to what is done for the Thomson problem on the
sphere. The Thomson problem on a Clifford torus is of interest because
super-cells with the topology of Clifford torus can be used to describe
periodic systems such as Wigner crystals. In this work we numerically solve the
Thomson problem on a square Clifford torus. To illustrate the usefulness of our
approach we apply it to Wigner crystals. We demonstrate that the equilibrium
configurations we obtain for a large numbers of electrons are consistent with
the predicted structures of Wigner crystals. Finally, in the one-dimensional
case we analytically obtain the energy spectrum and the phonon dispersion law.

Monte Carlo simulations to construct 850$\mu$m number counts and unveil an

$3.4\pm0.4$ and $2.5\pm0.2$, respectively. Therefore, the excess of SMGs is
likely part of the Mpc-scale environment around these systems. By combining all

in the overdensity factor from >3 within $\sim 2$ cMpc to $\sim2$ at the edge

the overdensities is larger than our maps. We computed preferred directions for
the overdensities of SMGs from the positions of the sources and used them to

paper, we propose a novel approach for semantic segmentation by eliminating the

rough information of individual semantic class proportions, shortened as
semantic proportions. It greatly simplifies the data annotation process and
thus will significantly reduce the annotation time and cost, making it more

networks (GNNs) from small graphs is generalizable to large graphs in the same
domain. Prior works suggest that the distribution shift, particularly in the
degree distribution, between graphs of different sizes can lead to performance
degradation in the graph classification task. However, this may not be the case
for biological datasets where the degrees are bounded and the distribution
shift of degrees is small. Even with little degree distribution shift, our
observations show that GNNs' performance on larger graphs from the same
datasets still degrades, suggesting other causes. In fact, there has been a
lack of exploration in real datasets to understand the types and properties of
distribution shifts caused by various graph sizes. Furthermore, previous
analyses of size generalizability mostly focus on the spatial domain.
  To fill these gaps, we take the spectral perspective and study the size
generalizability of GNNs on biological data. We identify a distribution shift
between small and large graphs in the eigenvalues of the normalized
Laplacian/adjacency matrix, indicating a difference in the global node
connectivity, which is found to be correlated with the node closeness
centrality. We further find that despite of the variations in global
connectivity, graphs of different sizes share similar local connectivity, which
can be utilized to improve the size generalizability of GNNs. Based on our
spectral insights and empirical observations, we propose a model-agnostic
strategy, SIA, which uses size-irrelevant local structural features, i.e., the
local closeness centrality of a node, to guide the learning process. Our
empirical results demonstrate that our strategy improves the graph
classification performance of various GNNs on small and large graphs when
training with only small graphs.

suggested in order to estimate a density ratio of the groups relatively close

further, a supervised classifier can be employed to estimate a class

we say about the treewidth of graphs containing no induced subgraph isomorphic

  Let us call these graphs $c$-perforated. While $1$-perforated graphs have
treewidth one, complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs are examples of
$2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth. But there are sparse
examples, too: Bonamy, Bonnet, D\'{e}pr\'{e}s, Esperet, Geniet, Hilaire,
Thomass\'{e} and Wesolek constructed $2$-perforated graphs with arbitrarily
large treewidth and no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_3$ or $K_{3,3}$; we
call these graphs occultations. Indeed, it turns out that a mild (and
inevitable) adjustment of occultations provides examples of $2$-perforated
graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth and arbitrarily large girth, which we
refer to as full occultations.
  Our main result shows that the converse also holds: for every $c\geq 1$, a
$c$-perforated graph has large treewidth if and only if it contains, as an
induced subgraph, either a large complete graph, or a large complete bipartite
graph, or a large full occultation. This distinguishes $c$-perforated graphs,
among graph classes purely defined by forbidden induced subgraphs, as the first
to admit a grid-type theorem incorporating obstructions other than subdivided

induced subgraph obstructions to bounded treewidth in graphs containing no

Unfortunately, none of the prior work achieves all the desirables. In this
work, we propose a novel method, GFairHint, which promotes individual fairness
in GNNs and achieves all aforementioned desirables. GFairHint learns fairness
representations through an auxiliary link prediction task, and then
concatenates the representations with the learned node embeddings in original
GNNs as a ""fairness hint"". Through extensive experimental investigations on
five real-world graph datasets under three prevalent GNN models covering both
individual similarity measures above, GFairHint achieves the best fairness
results in almost all combinations of datasets with various backbone models,
while generating comparable utility results, with much less computational cost
compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SoTA) method.

for decades. In addition to the study on the tetra-neutron system, it is
worthwhile to investigate the correlation in bound systems.
  Purpose: The $^8$He nucleus is a system where four neutrons are weakly bound
around the $^4$He core. The dineutron ($2n$) correlation has been long
discussed in various weakly-bound neutron-rich nuclei such as $^6$He and
$^{11}$Li, whereas the $^8$He nucleus gives us an opportunity to investigate
the $2n$-$2n$ type four-neutron correlation.
  Methods: We introduce a microscopic $^4{\rm He}+4n$ model and describe the
ground-state structure of $^8$He. The mixing of the two-$2n$ component in the
ground state is examined. The ground-state wave function is verified by
investigating various observables including high-energy scattering cross
sections.
  Results: Our model reasonably reproduces the available experimental data, the
binding energy, charge radius, total reaction cross section, and proton-nucleus
elastic scattering cross section data. We find that the significant mixing of
the two-$2n$ cluster configurations around $^4$He in the ground state of
$^8$He: The ground state has a squared overlap of about 45% with a
$2n$-$^4$He-$2n$ configuration with the $^4$He-$2n$ distance of 3 fm and
opening angle of 80$^\circ$.
  Conclusion: The ground state of $^8$He contains a certain amount of the
two-$2n$ cluster component, indicating the strong nuclear deformation, which
was experimentally observed recently.

previous work, it was shown that a free-fermion solution exists if the
frustration graph is either a line graph, or (even-hole, claw)-free. The former
case generalizes the celebrated Jordan-Wigner transformation and includes the
exact solution to the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter case generalizes a
non-local solution to the four-fermion model given by Fendley. Our
characterization unifies these two approaches, extending generalized
Jordan-Wigner solutions to the non-local setting and generalizing the
four-fermion solution to models of arbitrary spatial dimension. Our key
technical insight is the identification of a class of cycle symmetries for all
models with claw-free frustration graphs. We prove that these symmetries
commute, and this allows us to apply Fendley's solution method to each
symmetric subspace independently. Finally, we give a physical description of
the fermion modes in terms of operators generated by repeated commutation with
the Hamiltonian. This connects our framework to the developing body of work on
operator Krylov subspaces. Our results deepen the connection between many-body

interpretation of planetary signals induced by planetary caustics. In this
work, we check whether such degeneracies persist in the case of well-covered
signals by analyzing the lensing event KMT-2021-BLG-1150, for which the light
curve exhibits a densely and continuously covered short-term anomaly. In order
to identify degenerate solutions, we thoroughly investigate the parameter space
by conducting dense grid searches for the lensing parameters. We then check the
severity of the degeneracy among the identified solutions. We identify a pair
of planetary solutions resulting from the well-known inner-outer degeneracy,
and find that interpreting the anomaly is not subject to any degeneracy other
than the inner-outer degeneracy. The measured parameters of the planet
separation (normalized to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the lens
components are $(s, q)_{\rm in}\sim (1.297, 1.10\times 10^{-3})$ for the inner
solution and $(s, q)_{\rm out}\sim (1.242, 1.15\times 10^{-3})$ for the outer
solution. According to a Bayesian estimation, the lens is a planetary system
consisting of a planet with a mass $M_{\rm p}=0.88^{+0.38}_{-0.36}~M_{\rm J}$
and its host with a mass $M_{\rm h}=0.73^{+0.32}_{-0.30}~M_\odot$ lying toward
the Galactic center at a distance $D_{\rm L} =3.8^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$~kpc. By
conducting analyses using mock data sets prepared to mimic those obtained with
data gaps and under various observational cadences, it is found that gaps in
data can result in various degenerate solutions, while the observational
cadence does not pose a serious degeneracy problem as long as the anomaly

long-term outcomes for all inpatients across their seven hospitals.
Methodology/results: We develop machine learning models that predict the
probabilities of next 24-hr/48-hr discharge and intensive care unit transfers,
end-of-stay mortality and discharge dispositions. All models achieve high
out-of-sample AUC (75.7%-92.5%) and are well calibrated. In addition, combining
48-hr discharge predictions with doctors' predictions simultaneously enables
more patient discharges (10%-28.7%) and fewer 7-day/30-day readmissions

doctors, nurses, and case managers across seven hospitals use it in their daily
patient review process. We observe a significant reduction in the average
length of stay (0.67 days per patient) following its adoption and anticipate
substantial financial benefits (between \$55 and \$72 million annually) for the

learning models, so methods of predicting a model's performance on OOD data
without labels are important for machine learning safety. While a number of
methods have been proposed by prior work, they often underestimate the actual
error, sometimes by a large margin, which greatly impacts their applicability
to real tasks. In this work, we identify pseudo-label shift, or the difference
between the predicted and true OOD label distributions, as a key indicator to
this underestimation. Based on this observation, we introduce a novel method
for estimating model performance by leveraging optimal transport theory,
Confidence Optimal Transport (COT), and show that it provably provides more
robust error estimates in the presence of pseudo-label shift. Additionally, we
introduce an empirically-motivated variant of COT, Confidence Optimal Transport
with Thresholding (COTT), which applies thresholding to the individual
transport costs and further improves the accuracy of COT's error estimates. We
evaluate COT and COTT on a variety of standard benchmarks that induce various
types of distribution shift -- synthetic, novel subpopulation, and natural --
and show that our approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art
methods with an up to 3x lower prediction error.

sample selection bias, a type of bias caused by non-random sampling of examples
to be included in the training set. Although there are many approaches proposed
to learn a classifier under sample selection bias, few address the case where a
subset of labels in the training set are missing-not-at-random (MNAR) as a
result of the selection process. In statistics, Greene's method formulates this
type of sample selection with logistic regression as the prediction model.
However, we find that simply integrating this method into a robust
classification framework is not effective for this bias setting. In this paper,
we propose BiasCorr, an algorithm that improves on Greene's method by modifying
the original training set in order for a classifier to learn under MNAR sample
selection bias. We provide theoretical guarantee for the improvement of
BiasCorr over Greene's method by analyzing its bias. Experimental results on
real-world datasets demonstrate that BiasCorr produces robust classifiers and
can be extended to outperform state-of-the-art classifiers that have been
proposed to train under sample selection bias.

potential is a gauge-dependent quantity, there still exist not a few
researchers who claim that the AB-effect is caused by nonlocal action of the
magnetic field confined inside the solenoid. A serious drawback of such
non-locality explanation is that it is hard to offer definite mechanism of such
nonlocal interaction between separated charge and magnetic field. This is not
surprising, since the locality is the foundation of modern physics including
electromagnetism and quantum mechanics. On the other hand, there recently
appear some interesting attempts to explain the AB-effect through the
interaction between the charged particle and the solenoid current mediated by
the exchange of a virtual photon. A vital assumption of this approach is that
AB-phase shift is proportional to the change of the interaction energy between
the charged particle and solenoid along the path of the moving charge.
Accordingly, they insist that the AB-phase change along a path does not depend
on the gauge choice so that the AB-phase shift for a non-closed path is in
principle measurable. In the present paper, we critically examine this
astonishing conclusion with the utmost care and attention. At the same time, we

charged quantum massive scalar field on a $(D+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter
background induced by a magnetic-flux-carrying cosmic string in the braneworld
model context. We consider the brane parallel to the anti-de Sitter boundary
and the cosmic string orthogonal to them. Moreover, we assume that the field
obeys the Robin boundary condition on the brane. Because the brane divides the
space into two regions with different properties of the quantum vacuum, we
calculate the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the field squared and the
energy-momentum tensor (EMT) in each region. To develop these analyses, we have
constructed the positive frequency Wightman function for both regions. The
latter is decomposed in a part associated with the anti-de Sitter bulk in the
presence of a cosmic string only, and the other part induced by the brane. The
vacuum polarization effects associated with the higher-dimensional anti-de
Sitter bulk in the presence of cosmic string have been developed in the

brane. We show that the VEVs of the field squared and the components of the EMT

these observables with the corresponding ones induced by the brane only, and
show that near the brane the contribution induced by the latter is larger than
the one induced by the string; however, for points distant from the brane the
situation is reversed. Moreover, some asymptotic expressions for the VEV of the

if movement patterns in a single city could also have a spectrum of distance
exponents denoting a varying deterrence depending on the origin and destination
regions in the city. By analyzing the travel data in the twelve most populated
cities of the United States of America, we empirically find that the distance
exponent governing the deterrence of travels significantly varies within a city
depending on the traffic volumes of the origin and destination regions. Despite
the diverse traffic landscape of the cities analyzed, a universal pattern is
observed for the distance exponents; the exponent value tends to be higher
(lower) between regions with larger (smaller) traffic volumes. This indicates
that our method indeed reveals the hidden diversity of gravity laws that would

Furthermore, we enhance GPU resource utilization for scalable clients by
introducing a dynamic client scheduler, process manager, and resource-sharing
mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that FedHC has the capability to capture
the influence of various factors on client execution time. Moreover, despite

as well as an auxiliary vector time series. The matrix predictors are
associated with row/column-specific autoregressive matrix coefficients that map
the predictors to the future matrices via a bi-linear transformation. The
vector predictors are mapped to matrices by taking mode product with a 3D
coefficient tensor. Given the high dimensionality of the tensor coefficient and
the underlying spatial structure of the data, we propose to estimate the tensor
coefficient by estimating one functional coefficient for each covariate, with
2D input domain, from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We jointly estimate
the autoregressive matrix coefficients and the functional coefficients under a
penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework, and couple it with an
alternating minimization algorithm. Large sample asymptotics of the estimators
are established and performances of the model are validated with extensive

the loop have been investigated in the process of state transfer. The results
show that chiral or non-reciprocal state transfer can be realized when the loop
encircling a second-order EP with different radius. Only chiral state transfer
occurs when encircling two second-order EPs. Moreover, chiral and
non-reciprocal state transfer can happen in a single loop encircling a
third-order EP. The phenomena about encircling the EPs in a multimode
optomechanical system provides another means for manipulating state transfer in
higher-order non-Hermitian systems.

analytics, considers an optimization problem with the presence of covariates
(context or side information). The goal is to learn a prediction model (from
the training data) that predicts the objective function from the covariates,
and then in the test phase, solve the optimization problem with the covariates
but without the observation of the objective function. In this paper, we
consider a risk-sensitive version of the problem and propose a generic
algorithm design paradigm called predict-then-calibrate. The idea is to first
develop a prediction model without concern for the downstream risk profile or
robustness guarantee, and then utilize calibration (or recalibration) methods
to quantify the uncertainty of the prediction. While the existing methods
suffer from either a restricted choice of the prediction model or strong
assumptions on the underlying data, we show the disentangling of the prediction
model and the calibration/uncertainty quantification has several advantages.
First, it imposes no restriction on the prediction model and thus fully
unleashes the potential of off-the-shelf machine learning methods. Second, the
derivation of the risk and robustness guarantee can be made independent of the
choice of the prediction model through a data-splitting idea. Third, our
paradigm of predict-then-calibrate applies to both (risk-sensitive) robust and
(risk-neutral) distributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulations.
Theoretically, it gives new generalization bounds for the contextual LP problem
and sheds light on the existing results of DRO for contextual LP. Numerical
experiments further reinforce the advantage of the predict-then-calibrate
paradigm in that an improvement on either the prediction model or the
calibration model will lead to a better final performance.

of the non-uniform fast Fourier transform, thus arriving at an algorithm
capable of generating systems with arbitrary spectral properties, with a
computational cost that scales $O(N \log N)$ with system size. The method is
extended to accommodate arbitrary real-space interactions, such as short-range

example, we generate the largest-ever stealthy hyperuniform configurations in
$2d$ ($N = 10^9$) and $3d$ ($N > 10^7$). By an Ewald sphere construction we
then elucidate the link between spectral and optical properties at the
single-scattering level, and show that large, yet finite, stealthy hyperuniform

properties near-identical to those of simple hard spheres. Our approach for the
fast optimization of the spectral properties of point patterns should extend
readily beyond materials design, for instance to blue noise sampling and

clients. To address this challenge, various personalized FL (pFL) methods are
proposed such as similarity-based aggregation and model decoupling. The former
one aggregates models from clients of a similar data distribution. The later
one decouples a neural network (NN) model into a feature extractor and a
classifier. Personalization is captured by classifiers which are obtained by
local training. To advance pFL, we propose a novel pFedSim (pFL based on model

More specifically, we decouple a NN model into a personalized feature

pFedSim include: 1) significantly improved model accuracy; 2) low communication

properties, and understanding their behavior is important for developing
accurate theoretical models. In this study, we investigate the effect of chain
stiffness and monomer density on static and dynamic behaviors of ring polymer
melts using molecular dynamics simulations. Our first focus is on the
non-Gaussian parameter of center of mass displacement as a measure of dynamic
heterogeneity, which is commonly observed in glass-forming liquids. We find
that the non-Gaussianity in the displacement distribution increases with the
monomer density and stiffness of the polymer chains, suggesting that excluded
volume interactions between centers of mass have a stronger effect on the
dynamics of ring polymers. We then analyze the relationship between the radius
of gyration and monomer density for flexible and rigid ring polymers. Our
results indicate that the relationship between the two varies with chain
stiffness, which can be attributed to the competition between repulsive forces
inside the ring and from adjacent rings. Finally, we study the dynamics of
bond-breakage virtually connected between the centers of mass of rings to
analyze the exchanges of inter-molecular networks of bonds. Our results
demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of bond-breakage is coupled with the
non-Gaussianity in ring polymer melts, highlighting the importance of
bond-breaking method in determining the inter-molecular dynamics of ring
polymer melts. Overall, our study provides insights into the fundamental
mechanism of ring polymers and sheds light on the factors that govern their

features using a diffusion model trained by teacher features. This allows us to
perform better distillation between the refined clean feature and teacher

it on outputs from a stronger model, such as a proprietary system like ChatGPT
(e.g., Alpaca, Self-Instruct, and others). This approach looks to cheaply
imitate the proprietary model's capabilities using a weaker open-source model.
In this work, we critically analyze this approach. We first finetune a series
of LMs that imitate ChatGPT using varying base model sizes (1.5B--13B), data
sources, and imitation data amounts (0.3M--150M tokens). We then evaluate the
models using crowd raters and canonical NLP benchmarks. Initially, we were
surprised by the output quality of our imitation models -- they appear far
better at following instructions, and crowd workers rate their outputs as
competitive with ChatGPT. However, when conducting more targeted automatic
evaluations, we find that imitation models close little to none of the gap from
the base LM to ChatGPT on tasks that are not heavily supported in the imitation
data. We show that these performance discrepancies may slip past human raters
because imitation models are adept at mimicking ChatGPT's style but not its
factuality. Overall, we conclude that model imitation is a false promise: there
exists a substantial capabilities gap between open and closed LMs that, with
current methods, can only be bridged using an unwieldy amount of imitation data
or by using more capable base LMs. In turn, we argue that the highest leverage
action for improving open-source models is to tackle the difficult challenge of
developing better base LMs, rather than taking the shortcut of imitating
proprietary systems.

using the Quasi-Local (QL) Model proposed by Horvat et al. \cite{QL_Model} to
describe the anisotropy inside the neutron star. This study analyzes
approximately 60 unified tabulated EoS-ensembles, spanning from relativistic to
non-relativistic mean-field models, that comply with multimessenger constraints
and cover a broad range of stiffness. The results indicate that the
relationship between the parameters becomes more robust with positive
anisotropy, while it weakens with negative anisotropy. With the help of the
GW170817 \& GW190814 tidal deformability limit, a theoretical limit for the
canonical $f$-mode frequency for both isotropic and anisotropic stars is
established. For isotropic case the canonical $f$-mode frequency for event
GW170817 \& GW190814 is $f_{1.4} = 2.605^{+0.487} _ {-0.459}\ \mathrm{kHz}$ and
$ f_{1.4} = 2.093^{+0.150} _ {-0.125} \ \mathrm{kHz}$ respectively. These
established relationships have the potential to serve as a reliable tool to
limit the equation of state of nuclear matter when measurements of relevant
observables are obtained.

Stone-Wales (SW) and blister defects of graphenes by density functional theory
calculations. It is found that the intervalley transition is perfectly
suppressed in some structures although the intravalley scattering occurs by the
defect states of the SW or blister defects. Using the tight-binding model, the
perfect suppression of the intervalley transition in the SW and blister defects
is explained by the sublattice symmetry between the A and B sites of the
bipartite honeycomb lattice. In addition, introducing the additional carbon
atoms to graphenes to form blister defects, the defect states appear near the
Fermi level and the energies where the resonant scattering occurs on the
$\mathrm{K}$ and $\mathrm{K}^\prime$ channel electrons split. Making use of
this splits, the valley-dependent transport property will be achieved by local

estimation, existing methods have limited applicability in real-world scenarios
involving embodied agents and downstream 3D vision tasks. These limitations
mainly come from the necessity of 3D models, closed-category detection, and a
large number of densely annotated support views. To mitigate this issue, we
propose a general paradigm for object pose estimation, called Promptable Object
Pose Estimation (POPE). The proposed approach POPE enables zero-shot 6DoF
object pose estimation for any target object in any scene, while only a single
reference is adopted as the support view. To achieve this, POPE leverages the
power of the pre-trained large-scale 2D foundation model, employs a framework
with hierarchical feature representation and 3D geometry principles. Moreover,
it estimates the relative camera pose between object prompts and the target
object in new views, enabling both two-view and multi-view 6DoF pose estimation
tasks. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that POPE exhibits
unrivaled robust performance in zero-shot settings, by achieving a significant
reduction in the averaged Median Pose Error by 52.38% and 50.47% on the LINEMOD
and OnePose datasets, respectively. We also conduct more challenging testings
in causally captured images (see Figure 1), which further demonstrates the
robustness of POPE. Project page can be found with

problem of territory defense by large-scale heterogeneous robotic teams is
considered. The tasks include surveillance, capture of dynamic targets, and
perimeter defense over valuable resources. Since each robot can choose among
many tasks, it remains a challenging problem to coordinate jointly these robots
such that the overall utility is maximized. This work proposes a generic
coalition strategy called K-serial stable coalition algorithm (KS-COAL).
Different from centralized approaches, it is distributed and anytime, meaning
that only local communication is required and a K-serial Nash-stable solution
is ensured. Furthermore, to accelerate adaptation to dynamic targets and
resource distribution that are only perceived online, a heterogeneous graph
attention network (HGAN)-based heuristic is learned to select more appropriate
parameters and promising initial solutions during local optimization. Compared
with manual heuristics or end-to-end predictors, it is shown to both improve
online adaptability and retain the quality guarantee. The proposed methods are
validated rigorously via large-scale simulations with hundreds of robots,
against several strong baselines including GreedyNE and FastMaxSum.

  The key graph-theoretic ingredient in our result is as follows. Fix an
integer $t \geq 1$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph created from three paths on
$t$ edges by identifying one endpoint of each path into a single vertex. We
show that, given a graph $G$, one can in polynomial time find either an induced

smaller than the weight of $G$. This is a strengthening of a result of Majewski

after the deletion of $\Oh(\log |V(G)|)$ vertex neighborhoods. To reach the
final result, we employ an involved branching strategy that relies on the

However, we show that post-hoc explanations do not achieve this goal as their
explanations are highly dependent on fixed model parameters (e.g., learned GNN
weights). To address this challenge, this paper proposes RAGE (Robust Ante-hoc
Graph Explainer), a novel and flexible ante-hoc explainer designed to discover
explanations for a broad class of graph neural networks using bilevel
optimization. RAGE is able to efficiently identify explanations that contain
the full information needed for prediction while still enabling humans to rank
these explanations based on their influence. Our experiments, based on graph
classification and regression, show that RAGE explanations are more robust than
existing post-hoc and ante-hoc approaches and often achieve similar or better
accuracy than state-of-the-art models.

low-frequency microwave, stronger penetrability compared to visible light, and
stronger safety compared to X ray. Despite of recent advance in the last
decades, the high cost of requisite large-scale antenna array hinders
widespread adoption of MMW imaging in practice. To tackle this challenge, we
report a large-scale single-shot MMW imaging framework using sparse antenna
array, achieving low-cost but high-fidelity security inspection under an
interpretable learning scheme. We first collected extensive full-sampled MMW
echoes to study the statistical ranking of each element in the large-scale
array. These elements are then sampled based on the ranking, building the
experimentally optimal sparse sampling strategy that reduces the cost of
antenna array by up to one order of magnitude. Additionally, we derived an
untrained interpretable learning scheme, which realizes robust and accurate
image reconstruction from sparsely sampled echoes. Last, we developed a neural
network for automatic object detection, and experimentally demonstrated
successful detection of concealed centimeter-sized targets using 10% sparse
array, whereas all the other contemporary approaches failed at the same sample
sampling ratio. The performance of the reported technique presents higher than
50% superiority over the existing MMW imaging schemes on various metrics
including precision, recall, and mAP50. With such strong detection ability and
order-of-magnitude cost reduction, we anticipate that this technique provides a

to solve this problem. In this paper, inspired by the ability of human beings
to complement visual information details from ambiguous descriptions based on
their own experience, we propose a novel text-3D generation model (T2TD), which
introduces the related shapes or textual information as the prior knowledge to
improve the performance of the 3D generation model. In this process, we first
introduce the text-3D knowledge graph to save the relationship between 3D

to guide the target 3D model generation. Second, we integrate an effective
causal inference model to select useful feature information from these related
shapes, which removes the unrelated shape information and only maintains
feature information that is strongly relevant to the textual description.
Meanwhile, to effectively integrate multi-modal prior knowledge into textual
information, we adopt a novel multi-layer transformer structure to
progressively fuse related shape and textual information, which can effectively
compensate for the lack of structural information in the text and enhance the
final performance of the 3D generation model. The final experimental results
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves 3D model generation

modifications to the reward (negative cost) structure. The problem formulation
considers the average expected quadratic cost of the states and inputs over the
infinite time horizon, and the risky events are modelled as a quadratic cost of
the states at the next time step crossing a user-defined limit. Two approaches
are taken to handle the probabilistic constraint under the assumption of known

probabilistic constraint is replaced with the Chernoff bound, while for the
unknown system model case, the expected value of the indicator function of the
occurrence of the risky event in the next time step is used. The optimal policy
is derived from the observed data using an on-policy RL method based on an

using a 2nd-order and a 4th-order system, and the proposed method is compared

computation cost motivate us to explore a better solution. In this work, we
propose a new multi-modal visual grounding task, termed LiDAR Grounding. Then
we devise a Multi-modal Single Shot Grounding (MSSG) approach with an effective
token fusion strategy. It jointly learns the LiDAR-based object detector with
the language features and predicts the targeted region directly from the
detector without any post-processing. Moreover, the image feature can be
flexibly integrated into our approach to provide rich texture and color
information. The cross-modal learning enforces the detector to concentrate on
important regions in the point cloud by considering the informative language
expressions, thus leading to much better accuracy and efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the Talk2Car dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods. Our work offers a deeper insight into the LiDAR-based
grounding task and we expect it presents a promising direction for the
autonomous driving community.

quantum noise, the major obstacle to the execution of quantum algorithms.
However, realizing practical quantum error correction (QEC) requires resolving
many challenges to implement a high-performance real-time decoding system. Many
decoding algorithms have been proposed and optimized in the past few decades,
of which neural network (NNs) based solutions have drawn an increasing amount
of attention due to their high efficiency. Unfortunately, previous works on
neural decoders are still at an early stage and have only relatively simple
architectures, which makes them unsuitable for practical QEC. In this work, we
propose a scalable, fast, and programmable neural decoding system to meet the
requirements of FTQEC for rotated surface codes (RSC). Firstly, we propose a
hardware-efficient NN decoding algorithm with relatively low complexity and
high accuracy. Secondly, we develop a customized hardware decoder with
architectural optimizations to reduce latency. Thirdly, our proposed
programmable architecture boosts the scalability and flexibility of the decoder
by maximizing parallelism. Fourthly, we build an FPGA-based decoding system
with integrated control hardware for evaluation. Our $L=5$ ($L$ is the code
distance) decoder achieves an extremely low decoding latency of 197 ns, and the
$L=7$ configuration also requires only 1.136 $\mu$s, both taking $2L$ rounds of
syndrome measurements. The accuracy results of our system are close to minimum
weight perfect matching (MWPM). Furthermore, our programmable architecture
reduces hardware resource consumption by up to $3.0\times$ with only a small
latency loss. We validated our approach in real-world scenarios by conducting a
proof-of-concept benchmark with practical noise models, including one derived
from experimental data gathered from physical hardware.

Researchers usually used the NLA to explore non-local self-similarity (NSS) in
SISR and achieve satisfactory reconstruction results. However, a surprising
phenomenon that the reconstruction performance of the standard NLA is similar
to the NLA with randomly selected regions stimulated our interest to revisit
NLA. In this paper, we first analyzed the attention map of the standard NLA
from different perspectives and discovered that the resulting probability
distribution always has full support for every local feature, which implies a
statistical waste of assigning values to irrelevant non-local features,
especially for SISR which needs to model long-range dependence with a large
number of redundant non-local features. Based on these findings, we introduced
a concise yet effective soft thresholding operation to obtain
high-similarity-pass attention (HSPA), which is beneficial for generating a
more compact and interpretable distribution. Furthermore, we derived some key
properties of the soft thresholding operation that enable training our HSPA in
an end-to-end manner. The HSPA can be integrated into existing deep SISR models
as an efficient general building block. In addition, to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the HSPA, we constructed a deep high-similarity-pass attention
network (HSPAN) by integrating a few HSPAs in a simple backbone. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that HSPAN outperforms state-of-the-art

integrates the graph representation into Transformer to capture spatial-related

semantic gap among different resolution patches during feature fusion, which
creates a non-patch token for each branch as an agent to exchange information

This is a gravitational field theory coupled to matter, which, at early eras,
contains gravitational (Chern-Simons (CS) type) anomalies and torsion, arising
from the fundamental degrees of freedom of the massless gravitational multiplet
of an underlying microscopic string theory. The model leads to RVM type
inflation without external inflatons, arising from the quartic powers of the
Hubble parameter that characterise the vacuum energy density due to
primordial-gravitational-wave-induced anomaly CS condensates, and dominate the
inflationary era. In modern eras, of relevance to this work, the gravitational
anomalies are cancelled by chiral matter, generated at the end of the RVM
inflationary era, but cosmic radiation and other matter fields are still
responsible for a RVM energy density with terms exhibiting a
quadratic-power-of-Hubble-parameter dependence, but also products of the latter
with logarithmic $H$-dependencies, arising from potential quantum-gravity and
quantum-matter loop effects. In this work, such terms are examined
phenomenologically from the point of view of the potential alleviation of the
aforementioned current tensions in Cosmology. Using standard information
criteria, we find that these tensions can be substantially alleviated in a way
consistent not only with the data, but also with the underlying microscopic
theory predictions, associated with the primordial dynamical breaking of

Transformer (CT) generalizes the Transformer attention mechanism from such
low-level input features to more abstract, intermediate-level latent concepts
that better allow human analysts to more directly assess an explanation for the
reasoning of the model about any particular output classification. However, the
concept learning employed by CT implicitly assumes that across every image in a
class, each image patch makes the same contribution to concepts that
characterize membership in that class. Instead of using the CT's
image-patch-centric concepts, object-centric concepts could lead to better
classification performance as well as better explainability. Thus, we propose
Concept-Centric Transformers (CCT), a new family of concept transformers that
provides more robust explanations and performance by integrating a novel

generalization from a (finite or finite-dimensional) family of stacked
generalizations based on cross-validated performance does not perform ""much
worse"" than the oracle best. Our result strengthens and significantly extends

the context of probabilistic forecasting, each one with a different sensitivity
for how much the ensemble weights are allowed to vary across items, timestamps
in the forecast horizon, and quantiles. Experimental results demonstrate the
performance gain of the proposed method.

experimentally in the form of surface phonon polaritons with complex-valued

causal features that possess strong predictability for labels and invariant
predictability across attacks, to achieve graph adversarial robustness. Through
modeling and analyzing the causal relationships in graph adversarial attacks,
we design two invariance objectives to learn the causal features. Extensive

continuation of a nonresonant spectral subspace $E$ of a dynamical system
linearized at a fixed point. Passing from the full nonlinear dynamics to the
flow on an attracting primary SSM provides a mathematically precise reduction
of the full system dynamics to a very low-dimensional, smooth model in
polynomial form. A limitation of this model reduction approach has been,
however, that the spectral subspace yielding the SSM must be spanned by
eigenvectors of the same stability type. A further limitation has been that in
some problems, the nonlinear behavior of interest may be far away from the
smoothest nonlinear continuation of the invariant subspace $E$. Here we remove
both of these limitations by constructing a significantly extended class of
SSMs that also contains invariant manifolds with mixed internal stability types
and of lower smoothness class arising from fractional powers in their
parametrization. We show on examples how fractional and mixed-mode SSMs extend
the power of data-driven SSM reduction to transitions in shear flows, dynamic
buckling of beams and periodically forced nonlinear oscillatory systems. More
generally, our results reveal the general function library that should be used

problem for a multi-agent system with absolute (taken from agents themselves)
and relative (taken from neighbors) measurements. In the literature, the
relative measurements are difficult to deal with, and the SMFs highly rely on
specific set descriptions. As a result, establishing the general distributed
SMFing framework having relative measurements is still an open problem. To
solve this problem, first, we provide the set description based on uncertain
variables determined by the relative measurements between two agents as the
foundation. Surprisingly, the accurate description requires only a single
calculation step rather than multiple iterations, which can effectively reduce
computational complexity. Based on the derived set description, called the
uncertain range, we propose two distributed SMFing frameworks: one calculates
the joint uncertain range of the agent itself and its neighbors, while the
other only computes the marginal uncertain range of each local system.
Furthermore, we compare the performance of our proposed two distributed SMFing
frameworks and the benchmark -- centralized SMFing framework. A rigorous set
analysis reveals that the distributed SMF can be essentially considered as the
process of computing the marginal uncertain range to outer bound the projection
of the uncertain range obtained by the centralized SMF in the corresponding
subspace. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed
distributed frameworks and verify our theoretical analysis.

with the previous $\mu$SR result. Since the O$_{\rm A}$ XMCD signal is mainly
contributed by Ir 5$d$ $zx$ and $yz$ orbitals which also hybridize with O$_{\rm

at each round, a scalar reward is obtained and vector-valued costs are
suffered. The learner aims to maximize the cumulative rewards while ensuring
that the cumulative costs are lower than some predetermined cost constraints.
We assume that contexts come from a continuous set, that costs can be signed,
and that the expected reward and cost functions, while unknown, may be
uniformly estimated -- a typical assumption in the literature. In this setting,
total cost constraints had so far to be at least of order $T^{3/4}$, where $T$
is the number of rounds, and were even typically assumed to depend linearly on
$T$. We are however motivated to use CBwK to impose a fairness constraint of
equalized average costs between groups: the budget associated with the
corresponding cost constraints should be as close as possible to the natural
deviations, of order $\sqrt{T}$. To that end, we introduce a dual strategy
based on projected-gradient-descent updates, that is able to deal with
total-cost constraints of the order of $\sqrt{T}$ up to poly-logarithmic terms.
This strategy is more direct and simpler than existing strategies in the
literature. It relies on a careful, adaptive, tuning of the step size.

challenge, primarily due to the complexity of specifying the positional

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning,
conversational, and zero-shot generation abilities across various domains.
Surprisingly, these models also show great potential in realizing and
interpreting the 3D space. In light of this, we propose a novel language-guided
interactive 3D generation system, dubbed LI3D, that integrates LLMs as a 3D
layout interpreter into the off-the-shelf layout-to-3D generative models,
allowing users to flexibly and interactively generate visual content.
Specifically, we design a versatile layout structure base on the bounding boxes
and semantics to prompt the LLMs to model the spatial generation and reasoning
from language. Our system also incorporates LLaVA, a large language and vision
assistant, to provide generative feedback from the visual aspect for improving
the visual quality of generated content. We validate the effectiveness of LI3D,
primarily in 3D generation and editing through multi-round interactions, which
can be flexibly extended to 2D generation and editing. Various experiments
demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating LLMs in generative AI for
applications, e.g., metaverse. Moreover, we benchmark the layout reasoning

encouraged scientists to further engineer the properties of these materials.
This is often accomplished by stacking layered materials into more complex van
der Waals heterostructures. A much less popular but technologically promising
approach is the alloying of 2D materials with different element compositions.
In this work, we demonstrate a first step in manipulating the hBN bandgap in
terms of its width and indirect/direct character of the optical transitions. We
present a set of aluminum alloyed hexagonal boron nitride (hBAlN) samples that
were grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) on 2-inch sapphire
substrates with different aluminum concentration. Importantly, the obtained
samples revealed a sp$^2$-bonded crystal structure. Optical absorption
experiments disclosed two strong peaks in the excitonic spectral range with
absorption coefficient $\alpha \sim 10^6$ cm$^{-1}$. Their energies correspond
very well with the energies of indirect and direct bandgap transitions in hBN.
However, they are slightly redshifted. This observation is in agreement with
predictions that alloying with Al leads to a decrease of the bandgap energy.
The observation of two absorption peaks can be explained in terms of mixing
electronic states in the K and M conduction band valleys, which leads to a
significant enhancement of the absorption coefficient for indirect transitions.

learning methods widely used to learn representations of heterogeneous graphs.
Despite the fast development of HGNNs, they still face some challenges such as
over-smoothing, and non-robustness. Previous studies have shown that these
problems can be reduced by using gradient regularization methods. However, the
existing gradient regularization methods focus on either graph topology or node
features. There is no universal approach to integrate these features, which
severely affects the efficiency of regularization. In addition, the inclusion
of gradient regularization into HGNNs sometimes leads to some problems, such as
an unstable training process, increased complexity and insufficient coverage

theoretical analysis of the effects of gradient regularization on HGNNs. In
this paper, we propose a novel gradient regularization method called Grug,

propagated messages and the node features during the message-passing process.
Grug provides a unified framework integrating graph topology and node features,

of Grug: 1) Decreasing sample variance during the training process (Stability);
2) Enhancing the generalization of the model (Universality); 3) Reducing the

For inelastic materials, the directionality condition, a property for the

into account. Moreover, the integration of the constitutive relations calls for
an algorithm design of the internal state variables and their conjugate

specific styles for each attribute. To address the above problem, this paper
presents decoupled denoising diffusion models (DDDMs) with disentangled

models. We apply DDDMs to voice conversion (VC) tasks to address the challenges
of disentangling and controlling each speech attribute (e.g., linguistic
information, intonation, and timbre). First, we use a self-supervised
representation to disentangle the speech representation. Subsequently, the
DDDMs are applied to resynthesize the speech from the disentangled
representations for denoising with respect to each attribute. Moreover, we also
propose the prior mixup for robust voice style transfer, which uses the
converted representation of the mixed style as a prior distribution for the
diffusion models. The experimental results reveal that our method outperforms
publicly available VC models. Furthermore, we show that our method provides
robust generative performance regardless of the model size. Audio samples are

the impact of extreme miniaturization of the QDs, achieved through a reduction
of their growth time, on the spectral behavior and internal quantum efficiency
(IQE). The high Al content results in QDs with a reduced aspect ratio
(height/diameter) and thicker wetting layer when compared to the GaN/AlN
system. Self-assembled QDs grown with a metal/N ratio ranging from 0.5 to 0.8
show an IQE around 50%, independent of the Al content (up to 65%) or emission

exhibit a bimodal luminescence associated with inhomogeneous in-plane emission
attributed to fluctuations of the QD shape associated with extended defects.
Reducing the QD size exacerbates the bimodality without reducing the emission
wavelength. The power efficiencies under electron beam pumping range from 0.4%

  Neural Networks","Accepted for publication in Lecture Notes for Computer Science 2023",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Supervised deep learning methods typically rely on large datasets for
training. Ethical and practical considerations usually make it difficult to
access large amounts of healthcare data, such as medical images, with known
task-specific ground truth. This hampers the development of adequate, unbiased
and robust deep learning methods for clinical tasks.
  Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) are the result of several complex physical
and engineering processes and the generation of synthetic MR images provides a
formidable challenge. Here, we present the first results of ongoing work to
create a generator for large synthetic cardiac MR image datasets. As an
application for the simulator, we show how the synthetic images can be used to
help train a supervised neural network that estimates the volume of the left
ventricular myocardium directly from cardiac MR images.
  Despite its current limitations, our generator may in the future help address
the current shortage of labelled cardiac MRI needed for the development of
supervised deep learning tools. It is likely to also find applications in the
development of image reconstruction methods and tools to improve robustness,
verification and interpretability of deep networks in this setting.

attention. NFTs are capable of representing users' ownership on the blockchain
and have experienced tremendous market sales due to their popularity.
Unfortunately, the high value of NFTs also makes them a target for attackers.
The defects in NFT smart contracts could be exploited by attackers to harm the
security and reliability of the NFT ecosystem. Despite the significance of this
issue, there is a lack of systematic work that focuses on analyzing NFT smart
contracts, which may raise worries about the security of users' NFTs. To
address this gap, in this paper, we introduce 5 defects in NFT smart contracts.
Each defect is defined and illustrated with a code example highlighting its
features and consequences, paired with possible solutions to fix it.
Furthermore, we propose a tool named NFTGuard to detect our defined defects
based on a symbolic execution framework. Specifically, NFTGuard extracts the
information of the state variables from the contract abstract syntax tree
(AST), which is critical for identifying variable-loading and storing
operations during symbolic execution. Furthermore, NFTGuard recovers
source-code-level features from the bytecode to effectively locate defects and
report them based on predefined detection patterns. We run NFTGuard on 16,527
real-world smart contracts and perform an evaluation based on the manually
labeled results. We find that 1,331 contracts contain at least one of the 5
defects, and the overall precision achieved by our tool is 92.6%.

where only sparse ground-truth labels are available for learning. Existing
methods often rely on empirical label selection strategies, such as confidence
thresholding, to generate beneficial pseudo-labels for model training. This
approach may, however, hinder the comprehensive exploitation of unlabeled data
points. We hypothesize that this selective usage arises from the noise in
pseudo-labels generated on unlabeled data. The noise in pseudo-labels may
result in significant discrepancies between pseudo-labels and model
predictions, thus confusing and affecting the model training greatly. To
address this issue, we propose a novel learning strategy to regularize the
generated pseudo-labels and effectively narrow the gaps between pseudo-labels
and model predictions. More specifically, our method introduces an Entropy
Regularization loss and a Distribution Alignment loss for weakly supervised
learning in 3D segmentation tasks, resulting in an ERDA learning strategy.
Interestingly, by using KL distance to formulate the distribution alignment
loss, it reduces to a deceptively simple cross-entropy-based loss which
optimizes both the pseudo-label generation network and the 3D segmentation
network simultaneously. Despite the simplicity, our method promisingly improves
the performance. We validate the effectiveness through extensive experiments on
various baselines and large-scale datasets. Results show that ERDA effectively
enables the effective usage of all unlabeled data points for learning and
achieves state-of-the-art performance under different settings. Remarkably, our
method can outperform fully-supervised baselines using only 1% of true

learning, especially concerning the performance under distributions that differ
from training ones. Current methods, mainly based on the data-driven paradigm

encounter limited generalization due to model non-smoothness. In this paper, we
propose to investigate generalization from a Partial Differential Equation
(PDE) perspective, aiming to enhance it directly through the underlying
function of neural networks, rather than focusing on adjusting input data.
Specifically, we first establish the connection between neural network
generalization and the smoothness of the solution to a specific PDE, namely
``transport equation''. Building upon this, we propose a general framework that
introduces adaptive distributional diffusion into transport equation to enhance
the smoothness of its solution, thereby improving generalization. In the
context of neural networks, we put this theoretical framework into practice as
PDE+ (\textbf{PDE} with \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{D}istributional
\textbf{D}iffusion) which diffuses each sample into a distribution covering
semantically similar inputs. This enables better coverage of potentially
unobserved distributions in training, thus improving generalization beyond
merely data-driven methods. The effectiveness of PDE+ is validated in extensive
settings, including clean samples and various corruptions, demonstrating its
superior performance compared to SOTA methods.

Moreover, we are not limited to a single sine or multisine excitation signal.
Instead, any persistently exciting signal, like for example a noise excitation

For now, only batteries in rest, i.e. at a constant SOC after relaxation, are

then, they have been widely used as models and subsampling tools in statistics

their quantum origin, it is natural to wonder whether sampling a DPP on a
quantum computer is easier than on a classical one. We focus here on DPPs over
a finite state space, which are distributions over the subsets of
$\{1,\dots,N\}$ parametrized by an $N\times N$ Hermitian kernel matrix. Vanilla
sampling consists in two steps, of respective costs $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ and
$\mathcal{O}(Nr^2)$ operations on a classical computer, where $r$ is the rank
of the kernel matrix. A large first part of the current paper consists in
explaining why the state-of-the-art in quantum simulation of fermionic systems
already yields quantum DPP sampling algorithms. We then modify existing quantum
circuits, and discuss their insertion in a full DPP sampling pipeline that
starts from practical kernel specifications. The bottom line is that, with $P$
(classical) parallel processors, we can divide the preprocessing cost by $P$
and build a quantum circuit with $\mathcal{O}(Nr)$ gates that sample a given
DPP, with depth varying from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(r\log N)$
depending on qubit-communication constraints on the target machine. We also
connect existing work on the simulation of superconductors to Pfaffian point

self-contradictions occur frequently across different LMs for both famous and

results indicate that ChatGPT and GPT-4 are able to accurately identify

long-standing challenge in physics. In this work, we solve this problem by
introducing two novel algorithms to determine low-energy eigenstates based on a
compact matrix product state (MPS) representation of the multiple targeted
eigenstates. The first algorithm utilizes a canonicalization approach that
takes advantage of the imaginary-time evolution of multi-target MPS, offering
faster convergence and ease of implementation. The second algorithm employs a
variational approach that optimizes local tensors on the Grassmann manifold,
capable of achieving higher accuracy. These algorithms can be used
independently or combined to enhance convergence speed and accuracy. We apply
them to the transverse-field Ising model and demonstrate that the calculated
low-energy eigenspectra agree remarkably well with the exact solution.
Moreover, the eigenenergies exhibit uniform convergence in gapped phases,
suggesting that the low-energy excited eigenstates have nearly the same level

individual activities of ions including the association of ions. Here we study
multi-particle electrostatic interactions connected within higher cluster
integrals and identify the ionization constants of the mass action law of
associating ion clusters. In contrast to Bjerrum and Fuoss, our concept of
association is not based on spatial criteria, but instead on the strength of
interaction measured in powers of the Bjerrum parameter ($e^2 / D_0
k_{\text{B}} T a$ ; $a$ is contact) and defined by asymptotic properties of the
cluster integrals. For ion pair formation our mass action constant is the
classical counterpart of Planck's famous hydrogenic partition function. As a
rule, the new association constants are smaller than traditional expressions,
e.g., by Fuoss and Kraus, in the interesting regions of interaction parameters
about fifty percent. Several examples including CaCl$_2$, MgCl$_2$,
Na$_2$SO$_4$, K$_2$SO$_4$, LaCl$_3$ and a model of seawater are studied. For
several associating electrolytes and seawater, reasonable agreement with
experiments and Monte Carlo results is achieved.

displacement is considered. The reduced-order Luenberger type observer is
designed based on the obtained simplified state-space representation with a
time-varying system matrix. The resulted observation error dynamics proves to
be robust and appropriate for all variations of the system matrix, which are
due to the nonlinear spatially varying friction. A specially designed
tribological setup to accurately monitor the relative motion between two
contacting friction surfaces is used to collect the experimental data of the
deceleration trajectories when excited by a series of impulses. The performance
of the state estimation using the proposed observer is shown based on the

computation (ABC), synthetic likelihood, and neural posterior estimation (NPE)
rely on simulating statistics to infer parameters of intractable likelihood
models. However, such methods are known to yield untrustworthy and misleading
inference outcomes under model misspecification, thus hindering their
widespread applicability. In this work, we propose the first general approach
to handle model misspecification that works across different classes of SBI
methods. Leveraging the fact that the choice of statistics determines the
degree of misspecification in SBI, we introduce a regularized loss function
that penalises those statistics that increase the mismatch between the data and
the model. Taking NPE and ABC as use cases, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our method on high-dimensional time-series models that are
artificially misspecified. We also apply our method to real data from the field
of radio propagation where the model is known to be misspecified. We show
empirically that the method yields robust inference in misspecified scenarios,
whilst still being accurate when the model is well-specified.

construct a unified span-based heterogeneous graph from entity and relation
candidates and propagate class labels based on confidence scores. We then
employ a propagation learning scheme to leverage the affinities between
labelled and unlabeled samples. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our

materials. In nonmagnetic chiral crystals, the existence of the Kramers Weyl
fermions reveals the topological nature of the Kramers degeneracy at
time-reversal-invariant momenta (TRIMs). However, it is not clear whether Weyl
nodes can also be pinned at points of symmetry in magnetic materials where the
time-reversal is spontaneously broken. In this study, we introduce a new type
of Weyl fermions, called Heesch Weyl fermions (HWFs), which are stabilized and
pinned at points of symmetry by the Heesch groups in inadmissible chiral
antiferromagnets. The emergence of HWFs is fundamentally different from that of
Kramers Weyl fermions, as it does not rely on any anti-unitary symmetry
$\mathcal{A}$ that satisfies $\mathcal{A}^2=-1$. Importantly, the emergence of
HWFs is closely related to the antiferromagnetic order, as they are generally
obscured by nodal lines in the parent nonmagnetic state. Using group theory
analysis, we classify all the magnetic little co-groups of momenta where Heesch
Weyl nodes are enforced and pinned by symmetry. With the guidance of this
classification and first-principles calculations, we identify antiferromagnetic
(AFM) materials such as YMnO$_3$ and Mn$_3$IrGe as candidate hosts for the
AFM-order-induced HWFs.We also explore novel properties of Heesch Weyl
antiferromagnets, such as nonlinear anomalous Hall effects and axial movement
of Heesch Weyl nodes. Our findings shed new light on the role of symmetry in

electron-ion collisions in preparation for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).
Sar$t$re simulates exclusive diffraction in $e$A collisions, in principle for
any nuclear species and exclusive final state, usually a vector meson. The
coherent and incoherent cross sections for each process are calculated in the
colour dipole model for small $x$ from the first and second moments of the
respective amplitude, averaged over initial state spatial configurations.
Taking these averages is a very CPU demanding task. In order to function as an
efficient event generator, these amplitude moments are saved into lookup tables
which are used as input for the event generation, making the latter a very fast
process. However, there are many recent and ongoing developments of the dipole
models underlying the calculations, both in terms of fits of the model
parameters to new data as well as new parametrisations of the dipole or proton
geometries. Therefore, it is desirable to have a more flexible method for
producing the lookup tables. Here, we propose a method using neural networks

reason is the difficulty of effectively fusing the sparse radar point cloud on
the bird's eye view (BEV) plane with the dense images on the perspective plane.
The recent trend of camera-based 3D object detection using BEV features has
enabled a new type of fusion, which is better suited for radars. In this work,
we present RC-BEVFusion, a modular radar-camera fusion network on the BEV
plane. We propose BEVFeatureNet, a novel radar encoder branch, and show that it

We show significant performance gains of up to 28% increase in the nuScenes

Without tuning our model for the nuScenes benchmark, we achieve the best result

the probabilistic priors of the pre-trained diffusion model are incorporated

confinement of light offer a large light-matter coupling rate and a near-unity

threshold definition, taking into account the recycling process of photons when
$\beta$ is large. This threshold with photon recycling reduces to the classical
balance between gain and loss in the limit of macroscopic lasers, but
qualitative as well as quantitative differences emerge as $\beta$ approaches
unity. We analyze the evolution of the photon statistics with increasing

consistently marks the onset of the change in the second-order intensity

which aims to train well-generalized models for unseen target domains by
utilizing several source domains. Since domain labels, i.e., which domain each
data point is sampled from, naturally exist, most DG algorithms treat them as a
kind of supervision information to improve the generalization performance.
However, the original domain labels may not be the optimal supervision signal
due to the lack of domain heterogeneity, i.e., the diversity among domains. For
example, a sample in one domain may be closer to another domain, its original
label thus can be the noise to disturb the generalization learning. Although
some methods try to solve it by re-dividing domains and applying the newly
generated dividing pattern, the pattern they choose may not be the most
heterogeneous due to the lack of the metric for heterogeneity. In this paper,
we point out that domain heterogeneity mainly lies in variant features under
the invariant learning framework. With contrastive learning, we propose a
learning potential-guided metric for domain heterogeneity by promoting learning
variant features. Then we notice the differences between seeking variance-based
heterogeneity and training invariance-based generalizable model. We thus
propose a novel method called Heterogeneity-based Two-stage Contrastive
Learning (HTCL) for the DG task. In the first stage, we generate the most
heterogeneous dividing pattern with our contrastive metric. In the second
stage, we employ an invariance-aimed contrastive learning by re-building pairs
with the stable relation hinted by domains and classes, which better utilizes
generated domain labels for generalization learning. Extensive experiments show
HTCL better digs heterogeneity and yields great generalization performance.

cosmological scales. In the radial direction, peculiar velocities cause
redshift space distortions, an established cosmological probe, and can be
measured individually in the presence of an independent distance indicator. In
the transverse direction, peculiar velocities cause proper motions. In this
case, however, the proper motions are too small to detect on a galaxy-by-galaxy
basis for any realistic experiment in the foreseeable future, but could be
detected statistically in cross-correlation with other tracers of the density
fluctuations. We forecast the sensitivity for a detection of transverse
peculiar velocities through the cross-correlation of a proper motion survey,
modelled after existing extragalactic samples measured by Gaia, and an
overlaping galaxy survey. In particular, we consider a low-redshift galaxy
sample, and a higher-redshift quasar sample. We find that, while the expected
cosmological signal is below the expected statistical uncertainties from
current data using cross-correlations, the sensitivity can improve fast with
future experiments, and the threshold for detection may not be too far away in
the future. Quantitatively, we find that the signal-to-noise ratio for
detection is in the range $S/N\sim0.3$, with most of the signal concentrated at
low redshifts $z\lesssim0.3$. If detected, this signal is sensitive to the
product of the expansion and growth rates at late times, and thus would
constitute an independent observable, sensitive to both background expansion

potential to be employed in diverse machine learning applications. However,
since the conditionals involved in OT are implicitly specified via the joint

the critical gaps between machine and human translation. Existing research has
primarily focused on providing individual, well-defined types of context in
translation, such as the surrounding text or discrete external variables like
the speaker's gender. This work introduces MTCue, a novel neural machine
translation (NMT) framework that interprets all context (including discrete
variables) as text. MTCue learns an abstract representation of context,
enabling transferability across different data settings and leveraging similar
attributes in low-resource scenarios. With a focus on a dialogue domain with
access to document and metadata context, we extensively evaluate MTCue in four
language pairs in both translation directions. Our framework demonstrates
significant improvements in translation quality over a parameter-matched
non-contextual baseline, as measured by BLEU (+0.88) and Comet (+1.58).
Moreover, MTCue significantly outperforms a ""tagging"" baseline at translating
English text. Analysis reveals that the context encoder of MTCue learns a
representation space that organises context based on specific attributes, such
as formality, enabling effective zero-shot control. Pre-training on context
embeddings also improves MTCue's few-shot performance compared to the ""tagging""
baseline. Finally, an ablation study conducted on model components and
contextual variables further supports the robustness of MTCue for context-based
NMT.

interval of an interacting one-dimensional system of electrons is a
fundamental, yet as of now unresolved problem. Even in the non-interacting
case, charge counting turns out to be more difficult than anticipated because
it necessitates the calculation of a nontrivial determinant and requires
regularization. Moreover, interactions in a one-dimensional system are best
described using bosonization. However, this technique rests on a
long-wavelength approximation and is a priori inapplicable for charge counting
due to the sharp boundaries of the counting interval. To mitigate these
problems, we investigate the counting statistics using several complementary
approaches. To treat interactions, we develop a diagrammatic approach in the
fermionic basis, which makes it possible to obtain the cumulant generating
function up to arbitrary order in the interaction strength. Importantly, our
formalism preserves charge quantization in every perturbative order. We derive
an exact expression for the noise and analyze its interaction-dependent
logarithmic cutoff. We compare our fermionic formalism with the results
obtained by other methods, such as the Wigner crystal approach and numerical
calculations using the density-matrix renormalization group. Surprisingly, we
show good qualitative agreement with the Wigner crystal for weak interactions,

to those predicted by the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations.
The Halpha LF of the Virgo cluster is fairly flat (a=-1.07) in the range
10^38.5<LHa<10^40.5 erg s^-1, and it abruptly decreases at lower luminosities.
When compared to those derived for other nearby clusters and for the field, the
slope and the characteristic luminosity of the Schechter function change as a
function of the dynamical mass of the system, of the temperature of the X-rays
gas, and of the dynamical pressure exerted on the interstellar medium of
galaxies moving at high velocity within the intracluster medium. All these
trends can be explained in a scenario in which the activity of SF is reduced in
massive clusters due to their hydrodynamical interaction with the surrounding
medium, suggesting once again that ram-pressure stripping is the dominant
mechanism affecting galaxy evolution in local clusters of dynamical mass
M200>10^14 Mo. The comparison with the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations shows a more pronounced decrease at the faint end of the

However, numerical simulations often define these initial star forming clumps

clumps extracted from our previous low-mass star cluster simulations. To define
a clump, we identify all the gas in a simulation that ever becomes bound to or
accreted onto a star, then follow the gas backwards in time until it decreases
to a critical density. This gas, and its neighbouring gas, is defined as our
star forming clump. Our clumps span a mass range of $0.15 \lesssim M/$M$_\odot
\lesssim 10.2$, while the density range within each clump spans 2--4 orders of
magnitude. The gas density distribution is not smooth, indicating that it is
highly structured. The clumps are turbulent, with no coherent rotation.
Independent of the initial magnetic field strength of the parent cloud, all
clumps yield a similar range of field strengths. The clump magnetic field is

the linear analysis of the perturbation reveals that the cathode sheath (axial)
electric field $E_z$ triggers the gradient drift instability (GDI), deforming
the local potential until the instability condition is not fulfilled and the
fluctuation growth stops in which moment the instability becomes saturated. The
potential deformation consequently leads to the formation of the potential
hump, surrounding which the azimuthal electric field $E_y$ is present. The
saturation level of $E_y$ is found to be synchronized with and proportional to
the time-changing voltage applied at the cathode, resulting in the

highly anisotropic, resulting in significant instrument induced anisotropies in
the observed GW catalog. We investigate these instrumental effects for 3rd

temporal reasoning with numerous applications in artificial intelligence.
Recently, there has been a surge of improvements in the fine-grained complexity
of NP-hard reasoning tasks, improving the running time from the naive
$2^{O(n^2)}$ to $O^*((1.0615n)^{n})$, with even faster algorithms for unit
intervals a bounded number of overlapping intervals (the $O^*(\cdot)$ notation
suppresses polynomial factors). Despite these improvements the best known lower
bound is still only $2^{o(n)}$ (under the exponential-time hypothesis) and
major improvements in either direction seemingly require fundamental advances
in computational complexity. In this paper we propose a novel framework for
solving NP-hard qualitative reasoning problems which we refer to as dynamic
programming with sublinear partitioning. Using this technique we obtain a major
improvement of $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{n})$ for Allen's interval algebra. To
demonstrate that the technique is applicable to more domains we apply it to a
problem in qualitative spatial reasoning, the cardinal direction point algebra,
and solve it in $O^*((\frac{cn}{\log{n}})^{2n/3})$ time. Hence, not only do we
significantly advance the state-of-the-art for NP-hard qualitative reasoning

many problems where $2^{O(n)}$ time algorithms are unlikely.

phase. Its amplitude is proportional to the interaction strength, the phase

Harper equation with two different scales: the first is a magnetic scale with
the cell size corresponding to a unit quantum magnetic flux, the second scale
determines the inhomogeneity of the effective field, forms the steady fine
structure of the Hofstadter spectrum and leads to the realization of fractional
quantum Hall states. In a sample of finite size with open boundary conditions,
the fine structure of the Hofstadter spectrum consists of the Dirac branches of
the fermion excitations and includes the fine structure of the edge chiral
modes. The Chern numbers of the topological Hofstadter bands are conserved
during the formation of their fine structure. The edge modes are formed into
the Hofstadter bands. They connect the nearest-neighbor subbands and determine

-115.159+-0.670(stat)+-7.630(syst)deg. The relative impact of potential

Therefore, we propose a new set of parameters, for an united atom (UA) model,

thermodynamic and dynamical properties. Following the 3SSPP methodology, the
partial charges are chosen to match the experimental dielectric constant
whereas the Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters, $\epsilon$ and $\sigma$, are fitted
to reproduce the surface tension at the vapor-liquid interface and the liquid
density, respectively. Simulations were initially conducted for the propylamine
molecule by introducing three different types of carbon atoms, C$_\alpha$ and
C$_\beta$, with electric charges, and C$_n$, without charge. Then, modifying
the charges of the carbons and using the transferable LJ parameters, the new
set of constants for long amines were found. The results show good agreement
for the experimental dielectric constant and mass density with a percentage
error less than 1%, whereas for the surface tension the error is up to 4%. For
the short amines, methylamine and ethylamine, the new charges were obtained
from a fitting function calculated from the long amines results. For these
molecules, the values of the dielectric constant and the surface tension
present errors of the order of 10% with the experimental data. Miscibility of
the amines was also tested with the new parameters and the results show
reasonable agreement with experiments.

quantum annealing, we control not only the transverse field but also the
longitudinal field and slowly change the Hamiltonian to the problem Hamiltonian

networks. We claim that one important missing ingredient in past work is a
meaningful notion of graph-signal similarity measure, that endows the space of
inputs to MPNNs with a regular structure. We present such a similarity measure,
called the graphon-signal cut distance, which makes the space of all
graph-signals a dense subset of a compact metric space -- the graphon-signal
space. Informally, two deterministic graph-signals are close in cut distance if
they ``look like'' they were sampled from the same random graph-signal model.
Hence, our cut distance is a natural notion of graph-signal similarity, which
allows comparing any pair of graph-signals of any size and topology. We prove
that MPNNs are Lipschitz continuous functions over the graphon-signal metric
space. We then give two applications of this result: 1) a generalization bound
for MPNNs, and, 2) the stability of MPNNs to subsampling of graph-signals. Our
results apply to any regular enough MPNN on any distribution of graph-signals,
making the analysis rather universal.

processing workflow to obtain high quality velocity models and seismic images.
Leveraging on the idea of describing seismic wavefields as a superposition of
local plane waves, we propose to interpolate seismic data by utilizing a
physics informed neural network (PINN). In the proposed framework, two
feed-forward neural networks are jointly trained using the local plane wave
differential equation as well as the available data as two terms in the
objective function: a primary network assisted by positional encoding is tasked
with reconstructing the seismic data, whilst an auxiliary, smaller network
estimates the associated local slopes. Results on synthetic and field data
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling aliased (sampled
coarsely) data and data with large gaps. Our method compares favorably against
a classic least-squares inversion approach regularized by the local plane-wave
equation as well as a PINN-based approach with a single network and
pre-computed local slopes. We find that by introducing a second network to
estimate the local slopes whilst at the same time interpolating the aliased
data, the overall reconstruction capabilities and convergence behavior of the
primary network is enhanced. An additional positional encoding, embedded as a
network layer, confers to the network the ability to converge faster improving
the accuracy of the data term.

coefficients if the sample size $n$ is small, the dimension $p$ is (moderately)
large or the signal-to-noise ratio $1/\sigma$ is large (probabilities of
observing a label are close to 0 or 1). With this in mind, we study the
logistic regression estimator with $p\ll n/\log n$, assuming Gaussian
covariates and labels generated by the Gaussian link function, with a mild
optimization constraint on the estimator's length to ensure existence. We
provide finite sample guarantees for its direction, which serves as a
classifier, and its Euclidean norm, which is an estimator for the
signal-to-noise ratio.
  We distinguish between two regimes. In the low-noise/small-sample regime
($n\sigma\lesssim p\log n$), we show that the estimator's direction (and
consequentially the classification error) achieve the rate $(p\log n)/n$ - as
if the problem was noiseless. In this case, the norm of the estimator is at
least of order $n/(p\log n)$. If instead $n\sigma\gtrsim p\log n$, the
estimator's direction achieves the rate $\sqrt{\sigma p\log n/n}$, whereas its
norm converges to the true norm at the rate $\sqrt{p\log n/(n\sigma^3)}$. As a
corollary, the data are not linearly separable with high probability in this
regime. The logistic regression estimator allows to conclude which regime
occurs with high probability. Therefore, inference for logistic regression is
possible in the regime $n\sigma\gtrsim p\log n$. In either case, logistic

Recent work has aimed to provide textual summaries in the form of concise and

Analysis (KPA). One of the main challenges in KPA is finding high-quality key
point candidates from dozens of arguments even in a small corpus. Furthermore,
evaluating key points is crucial in ensuring that the automatically generated
summaries are useful. Although automatic methods for evaluating summarisation
have considerably advanced over the years, they mainly focus on sentence-level
comparison, making it difficult to measure the quality of a summary (a set of
KPs) as a whole. Aggravating this problem is the fact that human evaluation is
costly and unreproducible. To address the above issues, we propose a two-step
abstractive summarisation framework based on neural topic modelling with an
iterative clustering procedure, to generate key points which are aligned with
how humans identify key points. Our experiments show that our framework
advances the state of the art in KPA, with performance improvement of up to 14

evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we evaluate the generated summaries using a
novel set-based evaluation toolkit. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the
effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics in assessing the quality of

regression analyses of longitudinal data by introducing selection bias when the
visit and outcome processes are associated. Inverse intensity weighting is a
useful approach to addressing such selection bias when the visiting at random
assumption is satisfied, i.e., visiting at time $t$ is independent of the
longitudinal outcome at $t$, given the observed covariate and outcome histories
up to $t$. However, the visiting at random assumption is unverifiable from the
observed data, and informative visit times often arise in practice, e.g., when
patients' visits to clinics are driven by ongoing disease activities.
Therefore, it is necessary to perform sensitivity analyses for inverse
intensity weighted estimators (IIWEs) when the visit times are likely
informative. However, research on such sensitivity analyses is limited in the
literature. In this paper, we propose a new sensitivity analysis approach to
accommodating informative visit times in marginal regression analysis of
irregular longitudinal data. Our sensitivity analysis is anchored at the
visiting at random assumption and can be easily applied to existing IIWEs using
standard software such as the coxph function of the R package Survival.
Moreover, we develop novel balancing weights estimators of regression
coefficients by exactly balancing the covariate distributions that drive the
visit and outcome processes to remove the selection bias after weighting.
Simulations show that, under both correct and incorrect model specifications,
our balancing weights estimators perform better than the existing IIWEs using
weights estimated by maximum partial likelihood. We applied our methods to data
from a clinic-based cohort study of psoriatic arthritis and provide an R
Markdown tutorial to demonstrate their implementation.

setting is particularly relevant since, in practice, differentiability and
smoothness assumptions cannot be verified. To cope with nonsmoothness, several
authors use a smooth approximation of the target function and show that finite
difference methods approximate its gradient. Recently, it has been proved that
imposing a structure in the directions allows improving performance. However,
only the smooth setting was considered. To close this gap, we introduce and
analyze O-ZD, the first structured finite-difference algorithm for non-smooth
black-box optimization. Our method exploits a smooth approximation of the
target function and we prove that it approximates its gradient on a subset of
random {\em orthogonal} directions. We analyze the convergence of O-ZD under

complexity. In the non-smooth non-convex setting, we characterize the number of

smooth functions, our analysis recovers existing results for structured
zeroth-order methods for the convex case and extends them to the non-convex

function (clustering in time) holds important clues to the nature of observable
algebras, states, and dynamics in quantum gravity.
  We call operators that cluster in time ""mixing"" and explore the necessary and
sufficient conditions for mixing. The information loss problem is a special
case of the statement that in type I algebras, there exists no mixing
operators. We prove that, in a thermofield double (KMS state), if mixing
operators form an algebra (close under multiplication) the resulting algebra
must be a von Neumann type III$_1$ factor. In other words, the physically
intuitive requirement that all non-conserved operators should diffuse is so
strong that it fixes the observable algebra to be an exotic algebra called a
type III$_1$ factor. More generally, for an arbitrary out-of-equilibrium state
of a general quantum system (von Neumann algebra), we show that if the set of
operators that mix under modular flow forms an algebra it is a type III$_1$ von
Neumann factor.

direction has the same magnitude and direction, leading to the generation of
net charge current. However, in the zigzag direction, the spin up and spin down
photoresponse have the same magnitude with opposite directions, leading to the
generation of pure spin current. Furthermore, it is understood by analyzing the
bulk spin photovoltaic (BSPV) coefficient from the symmetry point of view.
Finally, we found that the net charge current generated in the armchair
direction and the pure spin current generated in the zigzag direction can be
further tuned with the increase of the material's buckling height $|h|$. Our
results highlight that these group-V monolayers are promising candidates for
novel functional materials, which will provide a broad prospect for the
realization of ultrathin ferroelectric devices in optoelectronics due to their
spontaneous polarization characteristics and high Curie temperature.

extremely difficult, especially in high-dimension spaces. Recently, the
gradient of log probability density (a.k.a., score) w.r.t. the sample is used
as an alternative statistic to compute. However, we find that the score is
sensitive in identifying adversarial samples due to insufficient information
with one sample only. In this paper, we propose a new statistic called expected
perturbation score (EPS), which is essentially the expected score of a sample
after various perturbations. Specifically, to obtain adequate information
regarding one sample, we perturb it by adding various noises to capture its
multi-view observations. We theoretically prove that EPS is a proper statistic
to compute the discrepancy between two samples under mild conditions. In
practice, we can use a pre-trained diffusion model to estimate EPS for each
sample. Last, we propose an EPS-based adversarial detection (EPS-AD) method, in
which we develop EPS-based maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to
measure the discrepancy between the test sample and natural samples. We also
prove that the EPS-based MMD between natural and adversarial samples is larger
than that among natural samples. Extensive experiments show the superior
adversarial detection performance of our EPS-AD.

source of distraction. However, little is known about how driving automation
affects how drivers interact with the center stack touchscreen, i.e., how
drivers self-regulate their behavior in response to different levels of driving
automation. To investigate this, we apply multilevel models to a real-world

differences in drivers' interaction and glance behavior in response to
different levels of driving automation, vehicle speed, and road curvature.

Specifically, at higher levels of driving automation (level 2), the mean glance
duration toward the center stack touchscreen increases by 36% and the mean
number of interactions per sequence increases by 17% compared to manual
driving. Furthermore, partially automated driving has a strong impact on the
use of more complex UI elements (e.g., maps) and touch gestures (e.g.,
multitouch). We also show that the effect of driving automation on drivers'
self-regulation is greater than that of vehicle speed and road curvature. The

Readers could mistake fake news for real news, and consequently have less

particle velocity update which is performed directly after the preliminary
velocity field has been computed in the absence of any IBM volume forcing term.
In addition, we apply the forcing term to the entire space occupied by the
immersed solid object (instead of to the vicinity of its interface only). The
present approach requires the evaluation of integrals of the velocity field
over the volume occupied by the solid particle, which are evaluated efficiently
as sums over the respective quantities available at particle-attached force
points. The resulting method can be used seamlessly for density ratios down to
$\rho_p/\rho_f>0.5$. The new formulation has been validated using three
configurations: (i) lateral migration of a neutrally buoyant circular particle
in two-dimensional Couette flow; (ii) the release from rest of a neutrally
buoyant sphere in a free stream; (iii) the release of a particle in a free
stream after an initial phase in which it is translationally fixed with an
imposed angular velocity. In all three test cases the present IBM formulation
yields a very good agreement with the available reference data. Thus, the
proposed approach is a cost-efficient and accurate modification of the original
method which allows for the simulation of fluid systems involving
density-matched solid particles.

be minimized, for example, by calibration. We observe that robots have
consistent deviations and argue that awareness and knowledge of these can be
exploited to serve a task. We measure heterogeneity in robot swarms caused by
individual differences in how robots act, sense, and oscillate. Our use case is
Kilobots and we provide example behaviors where the performance of robots
varies depending on individual differences. We show a non-intuitive example of
phototaxis with Kilobots where the non-calibrated Kilobots show better
performance than the calibrated supposedly ``ideal"" one. We measure the

We briefly discuss how these variations can enhance the complexity of

gain a deeper understanding of these systems and potentially unlock new
possibilities for their design and implementation of applications.

image processing applications. Many existing enhancement methods using physical
lighting models or deep-learning techniques often lead to unnatural results.
This is mainly because: 1) the assumptions and priors made by the physical
lighting model (PLM) based approaches are often violated in most natural
scenes, and 2) the training datasets or loss functions used by deep-learning
technique based methods cannot handle the various lighting scenarios in the
real world well. In this paper, we propose a novel vision-based exploratory
data analysis model (VEDA) for uneven light image enhancement. Our method is
conceptually simple yet effective. A given image is first decomposed into a
contrast image that preserves most of the perceptually important scene details,
and a residual image that preserves the lighting variations. After achieving
this decomposition at multiple scales using a retinal model that simulates the
neuron response to light, the enhanced result at each scale can be obtained by
manipulating the two images and recombining them. Then, a weighted averaging
strategy based on the residual image is designed to obtain the output image by
combining enhanced results at multiple scales. A similar weighting strategy can
also be leveraged to reconcile noise suppression and detail preservation.
Extensive experiments on different image datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method can achieve competitive results in its simplicity and effectiveness
compared with state-of-the-art methods. It does not require any explicit
assumptions and priors about the scene imaging process, nor iteratively solving
any optimization functions or any learning procedures.

  and Strong Normalisation","Ph.D. thesis; 158 pages; 11 figures",,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The Functional Machine Calculus (FMC) was recently introduced as a
generalization of the lambda-calculus to include higher-order global state,
probabilistic and non-deterministic choice, and input and output, while
retaining confluence. The calculus can encode both the call-by-name and
call-by-value semantics of these effects. This is enabled by two independent
generalisations, both natural from the perspective of the FMC's operational
semantics, which is given by a simple multi-stack machine.
  The first generalization decomposes the syntax of the lambda-calculus in a
way that allows for sequential composition of terms and the encoding of
reduction strategies. Specifically, there exist translations of the
call-by-name and call-by-value lambda-calculus which preserve operational
semantics. The second parameterizes application and abstraction in terms of
'locations' (corresponding to the multiple stacks of the machine), which gives
a unification of the operational semantics, syntax, and reduction rules of the
given effects with those of the lambda-calculus. The FMC further comes equipped
with a simple type system which restricts and captures the behaviour of
effects.
  This thesis makes two main contributions, showing that two fundamental
properties of the lambda-calculus are preserved by the FMC. The first is to
show that the categorical semantics of the FMC, modulo an appropriate
equational theory, is given by the free Cartesian closed category. The
equational theory is validated by a notion of observational equivalence. The
second contribution is a proof that typed FMC-terms are strongly normalising.
This is an extension (and small simplification) of Gandy's proof for the
lambda-calculus, which additionally emphasizes its latent operational
intuition.

of any aerial vehicle. With the emergence of complex, multi-body flying systems

fault detection and control strategies for these systems, too. In this paper we
propose a fault detection and control framework for the flying humanoid robot
iRonCub in case of loss of one turbine. The framework is composed of a failure
detector based on turbines rotational speed, a momentum-based flight control
for fault response, and an offline reference generator that produces
far-from-singularities configurations and accounts for self and jet exhausts
collision avoidance. Simulation results with Gazebo and MATLAB prove the
effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

electric field, that is, including the non-inductive component, is critical for
capturing the eruption dynamics. We present a detailed study of the effects of
optimisation of the non-inductive electric field on the TMFM of AR12473. We aim
to study the effects of varying the non-inductive electric field on the
data-driven coronal simulations, for two alternative parametrisations. By
varying parameters controlling the strength of the non-inductive electric
field, we wish to explore the changes in flux rope formation and their early
evolution and other parameters, for instance, axial flux and magnetic field
magnitude.The non-inductive electric field component in the photosphere is
critical for energising and introducing twist to the coronal magnetic field,
thereby allowing unstable configurations to be formed. We estimated this
component using an approach based on optimising the injection of magnetic
energy. However, the flux rope formation, evolution and eruption time varies
depending on the values of the optimisation parameters. The flux rope is formed
and has overall similar evolution and properties with a large range of
non-inductive electric fields needed to determine the non-inductive electric
field component that is critical for energising and introducing twist to the

result in a strong antiferromagnetic moment and a weak ferromagnetic moment,
which results in pronounced ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic spin modes.
However, some previous studies have shown unusual low-temperature behavior that
suggests a phase transition. By performing low-temperature magnetization
measurements, both in bulk and on the mesoscale, we have observed a low
temperature magnetic texture in this material in which a large c-axis
magnetization occurs. Magnetic fields along the c-axis as high as 1300 Oe were
observed close to the sample surface. This presents evidence for the onset of a

the Fe3+ moments would acquire a c-axis component to their canting below a

that there is a different ground state in this material than has been

helps to elucidate their relations. By explicit evaluations for a magnetic
topological insulator and a Rashba ferromagnet with perpendicular
magnetization, we observe ${\bm D}_i^{(2)} \ne {\bm D}_i$ in general. In the
latter model, or more generally, when the magnetization and the spin-orbit
field are mutually orthogonal, ${\bm D}_i$ is exactly related to the
equilibrium spin current for arbitrary strength of SOC, generalizing the
similar relation for systems with weak SOC. Among various systems with strong

$z$ is the redshift of observation, and $v$ is the amplitude of the bulk flow.
The dominant relativistic contributions at scales $z \lesssim 1$ are caused by
gravitational redshift and time-evolution of the velocity field. We include
these effects within a broadly applicable weak-field approximation, and provide
a cosmographic formula for estimating bulk flows at a high precision. Based on
this formula, we judge that recent bulk flow estimates are biased towards
larger values by $\sim 10\%$. This theoretical bias surpasses the measurement

while receiving the streaming speech inputs (a.k.a. streaming speech

based on the current received speech. However, segmenting the speech inputs at
unfavorable moments can disrupt the acoustic integrity and adversely affect the
performance of the translation model. Therefore, learning to segment the speech
inputs at those moments that are beneficial for the translation model to
produce high-quality translation is the key to SimulST. Existing SimulST
methods, either using the fixed-length segmentation or external segmentation
model, always separate segmentation from the underlying translation model,
where the gap results in segmentation outcomes that are not necessarily
beneficial for the translation process. In this paper, we propose
Differentiable Segmentation (DiSeg) for SimulST to directly learn segmentation
from the underlying translation model. DiSeg turns hard segmentation into
differentiable through the proposed expectation training, enabling it to be
jointly trained with the translation model and thereby learn
translation-beneficial segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
DiSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior segmentation

multivariate time series, comprising of time series for a range of quantities.
In some applications such complex systems can be associated with some
underlying network describing pairwise relationships among the quantities.
Accounting for the underlying network structure for the analysis of this type
of multivariate time series is required for assessing estimation error and can
be particularly informative for forecasting. Our work is motivated by a dataset
consisting of time series of industry-to-industry transactions. In this
example, pairwise relationships between Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) codes can be represented using a network, with SIC codes as nodes, while
the observed time series for each pair of SIC codes can be regarded as
time-varying weights on the edges. Inspired by Knight et al. (2019), we
introduce the GNAR-edge model which allows modelling of multiple time series
utilising the network structure, assuming that each edge weight depends not
only on its past values, but also on past values of its neighbouring edges, for
a range of neighbourhood stages. The method is validated through simulations.
Results from the implementation of the GNAR-edge model on the real
industry-to-industry data show good fitting and predictive performance of the
model. The predictive performance is improved when sparsifying the network
using a lead-lag analysis and thresholding edges according to a lead-lag score.

increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While
previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph

definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by
viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and

5G networks, and expected to support applications with the most stringent
quality-of-service (QoS). However, since the wireless channels vary
dynamically, the transmit power for ensuring the QoS requirements of URLLC may
be very high, which conflicts with the power limitation of a real system. To
fulfill the successful URLLC transmission with finite transmit power, we
propose an energy-efficient packet delivery mechanism incorparated with
frequency-hopping and proactive dropping in this paper. To reduce uplink outage
probability, frequency-hopping provides more chances for transmission so that
the failure hardly occurs. To avoid downlink outage from queue clearing,
proactive dropping controls overall reliability by introducing an extra error
component. With the proposed packet delivery mechanism, we jointly optimize
bandwidth allocation and power control of uplink and downlink, antenna
configuration, and subchannel assignment to minimize the average total power
under the constraint of URLLC transmission requirements. Via theoretical
analysis (e.g., the convexity with respect to bandwidth, the independence of
bandwidth allocation, the convexity of antenna configuration with inactive
constraints), the simplication of finding the global optimal solution for
resource allocation is addressed. A three-step method is then proposed to find
the optimal solution for resource allocation. Simulation results validate the
analysis and show the performance gain by optimizing resource allocation with
the proposed packet delivery mechanism.

experiments and theoretical calculations, condensates with interstellar ice
components. This fact is of uttermost importance for the chemistry in the
interstellar medium (ISM) because the condensation reaction is barrierless and
the subsequent species formed are still reactive given their open-shell
character. Carbon condensation on CO-rich ices forms the \ch{C=C=O}
($^3$$\Sigma$$^-$) species, which can be easily hydrogenated twice to form
ketene (H$_2$CCO). Ketene is very reactive in terrestrial conditions, usually
found as an intermediate hard to be isolated in chemical synthesis
laboratories. These characteristics suggest that ketene can be a good candidate
to form interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) via a two-step process,
i.e., its activation followed by a radical-radical coupling. In this work,
reactions between ketene and atomic H, and the OH and NH$_2$ radicals on a
CO-rich ice model have been explored by means of quantum chemical calculations
complemented by kinetic calculations to evaluate if they are favourable in the
ISM. Results indicate that H addition to ketene (helped by tunneling) to form
the acetyl radical (CH$_3$CO) is the most preferred path, as the reactions with
OH and NH$_2$ possess activation energies ($\geq$ 9kJ/mol) hard to surmount in
the ISM conditions, unless external processes provide energy to the system.
Thus, acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) and, probably, ethanol (CH$_3$CH$_2$OH)
formation via further hydrogenations are the possible unique operating
synthetic routes. Moreover, from the computed relatively large binding energies
of OH and NH$_2$ on CO ice, slow diffusion is expected, hampering possible
radical-radical couplings with CH$_3$CO. The astrophysical implications of
these findings are discussed considering the incoming James Webb Space

synthesis of reactive systems from temporal specifications, where they are
successfully used to generate finite-state systems. Due to their relevance for
practical applications, reactive synthesis of infinite-state systems, and hence
the need for techniques for solving infinite-state games, have attracted
attention in recent years.
  We propose novel semi-algorithms for solving infinite-state games with
$\omega$-regular winning conditions. The novelty lies in the utilization of an
acceleration technique that is helpful in avoiding divergence. The key idea is
to enhance the game-solving algorithm with the ability to use combinations of
simple inductive arguments in order to summarize unbounded iterations of
strategic decisions in the game. This enables our method to solve games on
which state-of-the-art techniques diverge, as we demonstrate in the evaluation
of a prototype implementation.

the emergent electric field. In particular, when magnetic-texture dynamics are
induced under the application of an AC electric current, the emergent electric
field also appears in an AC manner, notably, with an out-of-phase time profile,
thus exhibiting inductor behaviour, often called an emergent inductor. Here we
show that the emergent inductance exhibited by magnetic textures in the pinned

magnetic system. We numerically find that the inductance values defined from
the emergent electric field and the current-induced magnetization-distortion

sensitivity to high scale parameters (EENZ/BG), 3. sensitivity of Higgs soft
term due to high scale (HS) radiative corrections and 4. stringy naturalness
(SN) from the landscape. The EW measure is most conservative and seems
unavoidable; it is also model independent in that its value is fixed only by
the weak scale spectra which ensues, no matter which model is used to generate
it. The EENZ/BG measure is ambiguous depending on which ``parameters of
ignorance'' one includes in the low energy effective field theory (LE-EFT). For
models with calculable soft breaking terms, then the EENZ/BG measure reduces to
the tree-level EW measure. The HS measure began life as a figurative expression
and probably shouldn't be taken more seriously than that. SN is closely related
to EW naturalness via the atomic principle, although it is also sensitive to
the distribution of soft terms on the landscape. If the landscape favors large
soft terms, as in a power law distribution, then it favors m(h) ~ 125 GeV along
with sparticles beyond present LHC reach. In this context, SN appears as a
probability measure where more natural models are expected to be more prevalent
on the landscape than finetuned models. We evaluate by how much the different
measures vary against one another with an eye to determining by how much they
may overestimate finetuning; we find overestimates can range up to a factor of
over 1000. In contrast to much of the literature, we expect the string
landscape to favor EW natural SUSY models over finetuned models so that the
landscape is not an alternative to naturalness.

attributes (expression, head pose, lighting) to generate a synthetic face. This
technology is rapidly improving, but falls flat when reconstructing some
attributes, particularly gaze. Image-based loss metrics that consider the full
face do not effectively capture the perceptually important, yet spatially
small, eye regions. Improving gaze in face swaps can improve naturalness and
realism, benefiting applications in entertainment, human computer interaction,
and more. Improved gaze will also directly improve Deepfake detection efforts,
serving as ideal training data for classifiers that rely on gaze for
classification. We propose a novel loss function that leverages gaze prediction
to inform the face swap model during training and compare against existing
methods. We find all methods to significantly benefit gaze in resulting face
swaps.

  substrates",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Paints and coatings often feature interfacial defects due to disturbances
during the deposition process which, if they persist until solidification,
worsen the product quality. In this article, we investigate the stability of a
thin liquid film dragged by a vertical substrate moving against gravity, a flow
configuration found in a variety of coating processes. The receptivity of the
liquid film to three-dimensional disturbances is discussed with Direct
Numerical Simulations (DNS), an in-house non-linear Integral Boundary Layer
(IBL) film model, and Linear Stability Analysis (LSA). The thin film model,
successfully validated with the DNS computations, implements a pseudo-spectral
approach for the capillary terms that allows for investigating non-periodic
surface tension dominated flows. The combination of these numerical tools
allows for describing the mechanisms of capillary and non-linear damping, and
identifying the instability threshold of the coating processes. The results
show that transverse modulations can be beneficial for the damping of
two-dimensional waves within the range of operational conditions considered in
this study, typical of air-knife and slot-die coating.

  Feature Disentanglement",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Along with the recent development of deep neural networks, appearance-based
gaze estimation has succeeded considerably when training and testing within the
same domain. Compared to the within-domain task, the variance of different
domains makes the cross-domain performance drop severely, preventing gaze
estimation deployment in real-world applications. Among all the factors, ranges
of head pose and gaze are believed to play a significant role in the final
performance of gaze estimation, while collecting large ranges of data is
expensive. This work proposes an effective model training pipeline consisting
of a training data synthesis and a gaze estimation model for unsupervised
domain adaptation. The proposed data synthesis leverages the single-image 3D
reconstruction to expand the range of the head poses from the source domain
without requiring a 3D facial shape dataset. To bridge the inevitable gap
between synthetic and real images, we further propose an unsupervised domain
adaptation method suitable for synthetic full-face data. We propose a
disentangling autoencoder network to separate gaze-related features and
introduce background augmentation consistency loss to utilize the
characteristics of the synthetic source domain. Through comprehensive
experiments, we show that the model only using monocular-reconstructed
synthetic training data can perform comparably to real data with a large label
range. Our proposed domain adaptation approach further improves the performance
on multiple target domains. The code and data will be available at

the layered ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order upon stacking
alternation. This finding pointed out the importance of the apparently small
interlayer exchange, yet, existing literature addresses only its isotropic
part. To fill this gap, we combine the density functional theory with
Hamiltonian modeling to examine the anisotropic interlayer exchange in bilayer
CrI$_3$ - Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) and the Kitaev interaction (KI). We
develop and apply a novel computational procedure that yields the off-diagonal
exchange matrix elements with $\mu$eV accuracy. Inspecting two types of bilayer
stacking, we found a weak interlayer KI and much stronger DMI between the
sublattices of monoclinic bilayer and their complete absence in rhombohedral
bilayer. We show how these anisotropic interactions depend on the interlayer
distance, stacking sequence, and the spin-orbit coupling strength and suggest
the dominant superexchange processes at play. In addition, we demonstrate that
the single-ion anisotropy largely depends on stacking, increasing by 50% from
monoclinic to rhombohedral structure. Remarkably, our findings prove that
iodines, owing to their spatially extended 5p orbitals featuring strong
spin-orbit coupling, are extremely efficient in mediating DMI across the van
der Waals gap in two-dimensional magnetic heterostructures. Given that similar
findings were previously demonstrated only in metallic multilayers where the
DMI shows a much longer range, our study gives promise that the chiral control

when learning new tasks. This can be addressed by replaying previous tasks'
data stored in a memory, which however is usually prone to size limits and
privacy leakage. Recent studies store only class centroids as prototypes and
augment them with Gaussian noises to create synthetic data for replay. However,
they cannot effectively avoid class interference near their margins that leads
to forgetting. Moreover, the injected noises distort the rich structure between
real data and prototypes, hence even detrimental to IL. In this paper, we
propose YONO that You Only Need to replay One condensed prototype per class,
which for the first time can even outperform memory-costly exemplar-replay
methods. To this end, we develop a novel prototype learning method that (1)
searches for more representative prototypes in high-density regions by an
attentional mean-shift algorithm and (2) moves samples in each class to their
prototype to form a compact cluster distant from other classes. Thereby, the
class margins are maximized, which effectively reduces interference causing
future forgetting. In addition, we extend YONO to YONO+, which creates
synthetic replay data by random sampling in the neighborhood of each prototype
in the representation space. We show that the synthetic data can further
improve YONO. Extensive experiments on IL benchmarks demonstrate the advantages
of YONO/YONO+ over existing IL methods in terms of both accuracy and
forgetting.

converges to the true safe set with no policy regret. We evaluate CoCoRL in
tabular environments and a continuous driving simulation with multiple

that can be transferred to different tasks and environments. In contrast,
alternative methods based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) often exhibit

This suggests that a generator is an optional addition to any such generative

responsible for generating mass in the Standard Model (SM), making it
attractive to also consider spontaneous symmetry breaking as the origin of mass
for new particles in a dark sector extension of the SM. Such a dark Higgs
mechanism may in particular give mass to a dark matter candidate and to the
gauge boson mediating its interactions (called dark photon). In this review we
summarise the phenomenology of the resulting dark Higgs boson and discuss the
corresponding search strategies with a focus on collider experiments. We
consider both the case that the dark Higgs boson is heavier than the SM Higgs
boson, in which case leading constraints come from direct searches for new
Higgs bosons as well missing-energy searches at the LHC, and the case that the
dark Higgs boson is (potentially much) lighter than the SM Higgs boson, such
that the leading sensitivity comes from electron-positron colliders and
fixed-target experiments. Of particular experimental interest for both cases is
the associated production of a dark Higgs boson with a dark photon, which
subsequently decays into SM fermions, dark matter particles or long-lived dark
sector states. We also discuss the important role of exotic decays of the
SM-like Higgs boson and complementary constraints arising from early-universe
cosmology, astrophysics and direct searches for dark matter in laboratory
experiments.

effective way to enhance the robustness of STR models. Existing methods rely on
permuted language modeling (PLM) or masked language modeling (MLM) to learn
contextual information implicitly, either through an ensemble of permuted

results in the lack of information about future characters, while MLM provides
global information of the entire text but neglects dependencies among each

the training procedure of PLM, and to integrate MLM, we incorporate word length

This question is salient given recent successes of passively-trained language

limited. However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an
agent to learn generalizable strategies for determining and using causal
structures, as long as the agent can intervene at test time. We formally
illustrate that learning a strategy of first experimenting, then seeking goals,
can allow generalization from passive learning in principle. We then show
empirically that agents trained via imitation on expert data can indeed
generalize at test time to infer and use causal links which are never present
in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation
strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that
strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from
passive data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional
observations, with the support of natural language explanations. Explanations
can even allow passive learners to generalize out-of-distribution from
perfectly-confounded training data. Finally, we show that language models,
trained only on passive next-word prediction, can generalize causal
intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing examples of
experimentation, together with explanations and reasoning. These results
highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies,

signals recorded through a mixing operator, with limited prior knowledge about

inherently ill-posed and is further challenged by the variety of time-scales
exhibited by sources in time series data. Existing methods typically rely on a
preselected window size that limits their capacity to handle multi-scale
sources. To address this issue, instead of operating in the time domain, we
propose an unsupervised multi-scale clustering and source separation framework
by leveraging wavelet scattering covariances that provide a low-dimensional
representation of stochastic processes, capable of distinguishing between
different non-Gaussian stochastic processes. Nested within this representation
space, we develop a factorial Gaussian-mixture variational autoencoder that is
trained to (1) probabilistically cluster sources at different time-scales and
(2) independently sample scattering covariance representations associated with
each cluster. Using samples from each cluster as prior information, we
formulate source separation as an optimization problem in the wavelet
scattering covariance representation space, resulting in separated sources in
the time domain. When applied to seismic data recorded during the NASA InSight
mission on Mars, our multi-scale nested approach proves to be a powerful tool
for discriminating between sources varying greatly in time-scale, e.g.,
minute-long transient one-sided pulses (known as ``glitches'') and structured
ambient noises resulting from atmospheric activities that typically last for
tens of minutes. These results provide an opportunity to conduct further
investigations into the isolated sources related to atmospheric-surface

be effectively solved by partitioning the set of soft clauses into several
disjoint sets. The partitioning methods can be based on clause weights (e.g.,
stratification) or based on graph representations of the formula. Afterwards, a
merge procedure is applied to guarantee that an optimal solution is found.
  This paper proposes a new framework called UpMax that decouples the
partitioning procedure from the MaxSAT solving algorithms. As a result, new
partitioning procedures can be defined independently of the MaxSAT algorithm to
be used. Moreover, this decoupling also allows users that build new MaxSAT
formulas to propose partition schemes based on knowledge of the problem to be
solved. We illustrate this approach using several problems and show that
partitioning has a large impact on the performance of unsatisfiability-based
MaxSAT algorithms.

versatile hydrochar without the need for prior drying. The physicochemical
properties of hydrochar are influenced by biomass properties and processing

trial-and-error experiments. To save time and money, machine learning can be
used to develop a model that characterizes hydrochar produced from different
biomass sources under varying reaction processing parameters. Thus, this study
aims to develop an inclusive model to characterize hydrochar using a database
covering a range of biomass types and reaction processing parameters. The
quality and quantity of hydrochar are predicted using two models (decision tree

outperforms the support vector regression model in terms of forecast accuracy
(R2 > 0.88, RMSE < 6.848, and MAE < 4.718). Using an evolutionary algorithm,
optimum inputs are identified based on cost functions provided by the selected
model to optimize hydrochar for energy production, soil amendment, and
pollutant adsorption, resulting in hydrochar yields of 84.31%, 84.91%, and
80.40%, respectively. The feature importance analysis reveals that biomass

vectors, are at the heart of any language model (LM). However, lexical symbol
meanings can also be determined and even redefined by their structural role in
a long context. In this paper, we ask: is it possible for a language model to
be performant without \emph{any} fixed token embeddings? Such a language model
would have to rely entirely on the co-occurence and repetition of tokens in the
context rather than the \textit{a priori} identity of any token. To answer
this, we study \textit{lexinvariant}language models that are invariant to
lexical symbols and therefore do not need fixed token embeddings in practice.
First, we prove that we can construct a lexinvariant LM to converge to the true
language model at a uniform rate that is polynomial in terms of the context
length, with a constant factor that is sublinear in the vocabulary size.
Second, to build a lexinvariant LM, we simply encode tokens using random
Gaussian vectors, such that each token maps to the same representation within
each sequence but different representations across sequences. Empirically, we
demonstrate that it can indeed attain perplexity comparable to that of a
standard language model, given a sufficiently long context. We further explore
two properties of the lexinvariant language models: First, given text generated
from a substitution cipher of English, it implicitly implements Bayesian
in-context deciphering and infers the mapping to the underlying real tokens
with high accuracy. Second, it has on average 4X better accuracy over synthetic
in-context reasoning tasks. Finally, we discuss regularizing standard language
models towards lexinvariance and potential practical applications.

While existing research extensively studied optimizing the learning process,

their data, impacting the quality of the federated models learned. While FedAvg
treats each client equally and assigns weight solely based on the number of
samples, the diversity of samples on each client could greatly affect the local

novel approach to address this issue by introducing a Weighted Averaging
(WeiAvg) framework that emphasizes updates from high-diversity clients and
diminishes the influence of those from low-diversity clients. Specifically, we
introduced a projection-based approximation method to estimate the diversity of
client data, instead of the computation of an entropy. We use the approximation
because the locally computed entropy may not be transmitted due to excess
privacy risk. Extensive experimental results show that WeiAvg converges faster

the evaluation metrics themselves, that one can use to evaluate XAI methods.
This work aims to fill this gap by comparing 14 different metrics when applied
to nine state-of-the-art XAI methods and three dummy methods (e.g., random
saliency maps) used as references. Experimental results show which of these
metrics produces highly correlated results, indicating potential redundancy. We
also demonstrate the significant impact of varying the baseline hyperparameter

selection and parameter identification for the hyperelastic mechanical
characterization of human brain tissue. Following the motive of the recently
proposed computational framework EUCLID (Efficient Unsupervised Constitutive
Law Identitication and Discovery) and in contrast to conventional parameter
calibration methods, we construct an extensive set of candidate hyperelastic
models, i.e., a model library including popular models known from the
literature, and develop a computational strategy for automatically selecting a
model from the library that conforms to the available experimental data while
being represented as an interpretable symbolic mathematical expression. This
computational strategy comprises sparse regression, i.e., a regression problem
that is regularized by a sparsity promoting penalty term that filters out
irrelevant models from the model library, and a clustering method for grouping
together highly correlated and thus redundant features in the model library.
The model selection procedure is driven by labelled data pairs stemming from
mechanical tests under different deformation modes, i.e., uniaxial
compression/tension and simple torsion, and can thus be interpreted as a
supervised counterpart to the originally proposed EUCLID that is informed by
full-field displacement data and global reaction forces. The proposed method is
verified on synthetical data with artificial noise and validated on
experimental data acquired through mechanical tests of human brain specimens,
proving that the method is capable of discovering hyperelastic models that
exhibit both high fitting accuracy to the data as well as concise and thus
interpretable mathematical representations.

\emph{training dynamics} remains a mystery. In this paper, for 1-layer
transformer with one self-attention layer plus one decoder layer, we analyze
its SGD training dynamics for the task of next token prediction in a
mathematically rigorous manner. We open the black box of the dynamic process of
how the self-attention layer combines input tokens, and reveal the nature of
underlying inductive bias. More specifically, with the assumption (a) no
positional encoding, (b) long input sequence, and (c) the decoder layer learns
faster than the self-attention layer, we prove that self-attention acts as a
\emph{discriminative scanning algorithm}: starting from uniform attention, it
gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be
predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across
different next tokens. Among distinct tokens, it progressively drops attention
weights, following the order of low to high co-occurrence between the key and
the query token in the training set. Interestingly, this procedure does not
lead to winner-takes-all, but decelerates due to a \emph{phase transition} that

drug repurposing is the only solution with saving cost and time. In this study,
we used the Zinc database to screen the world-approved including FDA-approved
5903 drugs for repurposing as potential COVID-19 treatments targeting the main
protease 3CL of SARS-CoV-2. We performed molecular docking using Autodock-Vina
to check the efficacy of drug molecules. To enhance the efficiency of drug

learning regression approaches for QSAR modeling such as decision tree, extra
trees, MLP, KNN, XGBoost, and gradient boosting. The computational results
demonstrated that Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model has improved statistical
measures of R2 and RMSE. These simulated results helped to identify drugs with
high binding affinity and favorable binding energies. From the statistical
analysis, we shortlisted six promising drugs with their respective Zinc IDs

-13.6 kcal/mol. All are novel compounds except ZINC000203757351 antiviral
compound that was already identified against COVID-19 in other studies.
Further, we analyzed the physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of these
selected drugs with respect to their best binding interaction to specific
target protease 3CLpro. Our study has provided an efficient framework for drug

classical atom, the SO(4) degeneracy group, the non-invariance group or

models is mostly based on image quality measurements, and most researchers
favor synthetic images that produce realistic images, i.e., images with good
fidelity scores, such as low Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and high Peak
Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR). However, the quality of synthetic images is not
limited to fidelity, and a wide spectrum of metrics should be evaluated to
comprehensively measure the quality of synthetic images. In addition, quality
metrics are not truthful predictors of the utility of synthetic images, and the
relations between these evaluation metrics are not yet clear. In this work, we
have established a comprehensive set of evaluators for synthetic images,
including fidelity, variety, privacy, and utility. By analyzing more than 100k
chest X-ray images and their synthetic copies, we have demonstrated that there
is an inevitable trade-off between synthetic image fidelity, variety, and
privacy. In addition, we have empirically demonstrated that the utility score
does not require images with both high fidelity and high variety. For intra-
and cross-task data augmentation, mode-collapsed images and low-fidelity images
can still demonstrate high utility. Finally, our experiments have also showed
that it is possible to produce images with both high utility and privacy, which
can provide a strong rationale for the use of deep generative models in
privacy-preserving applications. Our study can shore up comprehensive guidance
for the evaluation of synthetic images and elicit further developments for
utility-aware deep generative models in medical image synthesis.

we solved a combined design and scheduling optimization problem, which provides
the optimal size of the units of the plant and their optimal (quasi-stationary)

higher-dimensional formal groups over the ring of $p$-adic integers, if they
have infinitely many torsion points in common, then they coincide. Finally, we
prove if $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ are $d$-dimensional stable
$p$-adic dynamical systems with infinitely many preperiodic points in common
then $\mathcal{D}_1$ and $\mathcal{D}_2$ coincide.

  Hidden Markov Model: Evidence from the PSID",,,,,"stat.AP cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents a hidden Markov model designed to investigate the complex
nature of earnings persistence. The proposed model assumes that the residuals
of log-earnings consist of a persistent component and a transitory component,
both following general Markov processes. Nonparametric identification is
achieved through spectral decomposition of linear operators, and a modified
stochastic EM algorithm is introduced for model estimation. Applying the
framework to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) dataset, we find that
the earnings process displays nonlinear persistence, conditional skewness, and
conditional kurtosis. Additionally, the transitory component is found to
possess non-Gaussian properties, resulting in a significantly asymmetric
distributional impact when high-earning households face negative shocks or
low-earning households encounter positive shocks. Our empirical findings also
reveal the presence of ARCH effects in earnings at horizons ranging from 2 to 8
years, further highlighting the complex dynamics of earnings persistence.

  Discriminative Representation Learning","Accepted by SIGKDD 2023 Research track; 12 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human activity recognition (HAR) is a time series classification task that
focuses on identifying the motion patterns from human sensor readings. Adequate
data is essential but a major bottleneck for training a generalizable HAR
model, which assists customization and optimization of online web applications.
However, it is costly in time and economy to collect large-scale labeled data
in reality, i.e., the low-resource challenge. Meanwhile, data collected from
different persons have distribution shifts due to different living habits, body
shapes, age groups, etc. The low-resource and distribution shift challenges are
detrimental to HAR when applying the trained model to new unseen subjects. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach called Diverse and Discriminative
representation Learning (DDLearn) for generalizable low-resource HAR. DDLearn
simultaneously considers diversity and discrimination learning. With the
constructed self-supervised learning task, DDLearn enlarges the data diversity
and explores the latent activity properties. Then, we propose a diversity
preservation module to preserve the diversity of learned features by enlarging
the distribution divergence between the original and augmented domains.
Meanwhile, DDLearn also enhances semantic discrimination by learning
discriminative representations with supervised contrastive learning. Extensive
experiments on three public HAR datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-art methods by an average accuracy
improvement of 9.5% under the low-resource distribution shift scenarios, while
being a generic, explainable, and flexible framework.

  Diffusion Models",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have showcased their remarkable
capabilities in learning and generating images. A large community of GDMs has
naturally emerged, further promoting the diversified applications of GDMs in
various fields. However, this unrestricted proliferation has raised serious
concerns about copyright protection. For example, artists including painters
and photographers are becoming increasingly concerned that GDMs could
effortlessly replicate their unique creative works without authorization. In
response to these challenges, we introduce a novel watermarking scheme,
DiffusionShield, tailored for GDMs. DiffusionShield protects images from
copyright infringement by GDMs through encoding the ownership information into
an imperceptible watermark and injecting it into the images. Its watermark can
be easily learned by GDMs and will be reproduced in their generated images. By
detecting the watermark from generated images, copyright infringement can be
exposed with evidence. Benefiting from the uniformity of the watermarks and the
joint optimization method, DiffusionShield ensures low distortion of the
original image, high watermark detection performance, and the ability to embed
lengthy messages. We conduct rigorous and comprehensive experiments to show the
effectiveness of DiffusionShield in defending against infringement by GDMs and
its superiority over traditional watermarking methods.

recent years. According to DappRadar, the total transaction volume on OpenSea,
the largest NFT marketplace, reached 34.7 billion dollars in February 2023.
However, the NFT market is mostly unregulated and there are significant
concerns about money laundering, fraud and wash trading. Amateur traders and
retail investors comprise a significant fraction of the NFT market. Hence it is
important that researchers highlight the relevant risks involved in NFT
trading. In this paper, we attempt to uncover common fraudulent behaviors such
as wash trading that could mislead other traders. Using market data, we design
quantitative features from the network, monetary, and temporal perspectives
that are fed into K-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm to sort
traders into groups. Lastly, we discuss the clustering results' significance
and how regulations can reduce undesired behaviors. Our work can potentially
help regulators narrow down their search space for bad actors in the market as
well as provide insights for amateur traders to protect themselves from
unforeseen frauds.

  Zhong, Xu Han, Yinhai Wang","FollowNet: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Car-Following Behavior Modeling",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Car-following is a control process in which a following vehicle (FV) adjusts
its acceleration to keep a safe distance from the lead vehicle (LV). Recently,
there has been a booming of data-driven models that enable more accurate
modeling of car-following through real-world driving datasets. Although there
are several public datasets available, their formats are not always consistent,
making it challenging to determine the state-of-the-art models and how well a
new model performs compared to existing ones. In contrast, research fields such
as image recognition and object detection have benchmark datasets like
ImageNet, Microsoft COCO, and KITTI. To address this gap and promote the
development of microscopic traffic flow modeling, we establish a public
benchmark dataset for car-following behavior modeling. The benchmark consists
of more than 80K car-following events extracted from five public driving
datasets using the same criteria. These events cover diverse situations
including different road types, various weather conditions, and mixed traffic
flows with autonomous vehicles. Moreover, to give an overview of current
progress in car-following modeling, we implemented and tested representative
baseline models with the benchmark. Results show that the deep deterministic
policy gradient (DDPG) based model performs competitively with a lower MSE for
spacing compared to traditional intelligent driver model (IDM) and
Gazis-Herman-Rothery (GHR) models, and a smaller collision rate compared to
fully connected neural network (NN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models in
most datasets. The established benchmark will provide researchers with
consistent data formats and metrics for cross-comparing different car-following
models, promoting the development of more accurate models. We open-source our
dataset and implementation code in

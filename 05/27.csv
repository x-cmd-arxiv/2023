subsequently generating answers from fine-grained relevant passages within a

the relationship between questions and passages. However, the diversity in
surface form expressions can hinder the model's ability to capture accurate
correlations, especially within complex contexts. Therefore, we utilize
Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to assist the model in
understanding complex semantic information. We introduce a method known as
Graph-as-Token (GST) to incorporate AMRs into PLMs. Results from Natural
Questions (NQ) and TriviaQA (TQ) demonstrate that our GST method can
significantly improve performance, resulting in up to 2.44/3.17 Exact Match
score improvements on NQ/TQ respectively. Furthermore, our method enhances
robustness and outperforms alternative Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods for
integrating AMRs. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to employ
semantic graphs in ODQA.

we aim to understand these design choices and determine what makes a

survey visualization thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization
thumbnail practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on
the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for
visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of
visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study results
indicate that different chart components play different roles in attracting
reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of the visualization
thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design strategies for effectively
combining the charts' components, such as a data summary with highlights and
data labels, and a visual legend with text labels and Human Recognizable
Objects (HROs), into thumbnails. Ultimately, we distill our findings into
design implications that allow effective visualization thumbnail designs for
data-rich news articles. Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward
providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data

factorised scattering theory. In fact, the above perturbations were shown to
preserve integrability. The resulting deformed scattering matrices -
extensively analysed with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz - provide the first

present a systematic approach to computing matrix elements of operators in

the undeformed ones and of a perturbation- and theory-dependent term. From
these solutions, correlation functions can be obtained and their asymptotic

a learning agent selects an ordered list of items and receives feedback through
user clicks. Although potential attacks against OLTR algorithms may cause
serious losses in real-world applications, little is known about adversarial
attacks on OLTR. This paper studies attack strategies against multiple variants
of OLTR. Our first result provides an attack strategy against the UCB algorithm
on classical stochastic bandits with binary feedback, which solves the key
issues caused by bounded and discrete feedback that previous works can not
handle. Building on this result, we design attack algorithms against UCB-based
OLTR algorithms in position-based and cascade models. Finally, we propose a
general attack strategy against any algorithm under the general click model.
Each attack algorithm manipulates the learning agent into choosing the target
attack item $T-o(T)$ times, incurring a cumulative cost of $o(T)$. Experiments
on synthetic and real data further validate the effectiveness of our proposed
attack algorithms.

are the first to investigate how multimodal models handle diverse gender
identities. Concretely, we conduct a thorough analysis in which we compare the
output of three image generation models for prompts containing cisgender vs.
non-cisgender identity terms. Our findings demonstrate that certain
non-cisgender identities are consistently (mis)represented as less human, more
stereotyped and more sexualised. We complement our experimental analysis with
(a)~a survey among non-cisgender individuals and (b) a series of interviews, to
establish which harms affected individuals anticipate, and how they would like
to be represented. We find respondents are particularly concerned about
misrepresentation, and the potential to drive harmful behaviours and beliefs.
Simple heuristics to limit offensive content are widely rejected, and instead
respondents call for community involvement, curated training data and the
ability to customise. These improvements could pave the way for a future where
change is led by the affected community, and technology is used to positively
``[portray] queerness in ways that we haven't even thought of'' rather than

First, CREST generates valid counterfactuals that are more natural than those

we introduce a new loss function that leverages CREST counterfactuals to

exploration of novel quantum states of matter at the focus of several research
fields, with particular efforts towards understanding and controlling the
behaviour of quantum entangled and other strongly interacting electronic
states. Experimental investigation is of primary importance, but requires
measurements at ultra-low temperatures where the quantum states of interest
have long lifetimes. Under these conditions, low energy interactions, such as
hyperfine or nuclear exchange interactions, become relevant, and can modify
electronic ground states and their associated excitations in multiple ways that
are not well understood or characterised. In this work, we use a recently
developed magnetic susceptibility technique, compatible with ultra-low
temperatures and high magnetic fields, to probe the influence of nuclear
interactions on superconducting and multipole ordered ground states in the
strongly correlated electron system PrOs4Sb12. We find that the multipole order
develops a novel, entangled nuclear-electronic character at the lowest
temperatures, which significantly modifies the phase boundary and leads to a
nuclear quantum critical point. In the superconducting phase, we find that
hyperfine interactions suppress superconductivity in a manner that provides
evidence for superconducting pairing mediated by crystal field excitations. Our
results on PrOs4Sb12 experimentally establish a new type of non-magnetic,
nuclear quantum critical point, and give revealing insight into a highly
unusual superconducting state. They also demonstrate more generally the
feasibility of exploiting hyperfine interactions as a tuning parameter for
experimental creation and investigation of a variety of quantum states and

in correcting the energy calculated by a wave-function method with a given
basis set by a density functional. This basis-set correction density functional
incorporates the short-range electron correlation effects missing in the basis
set. This results in accelerated basis convergences of ground-state energies to
the complete-basis-set limit. In this work, we extend the basis-set correction
method to a linear-response formalism for calculating excited-state energies.
We give the general linear-response equations, as well as the more specific
equations for configuration-interaction wave functions. As a proof of concept,
we apply this approach to the calculations of excited-state energies in a
one-dimensional two-electron model system with harmonic potential and a
Dirac-delta electron-electron interaction. The results obtained with
full-configuration-interaction wave functions expanded in a basis of Hermite
functions and a local-density-approximation basis-set correction functional
show that the present approach does not help in accelerating the basis
convergence of excitation energies. However, we show that it significantly
accelerates basis convergences of excited-state total energies.

reliance on online methods to model complex and lengthy video sequences.
However, the degradation of representation and noise accumulation of the online
methods, especially during occlusion and abrupt changes, pose substantial
challenges. Transformer-based query propagation provides promising directions
at the cost of quadratic memory attention. However, they are susceptible to the
degradation of instance features due to the above-mentioned challenges and
suffer from cascading effects. The detection and rectification of such errors
remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GRAtt-VIS},
\textbf{G}ated \textbf{R}esidual \textbf{Att}ention for \textbf{V}ideo
\textbf{I}nstance \textbf{S}egmentation. Firstly, we leverage a
Gumbel-Softmax-based gate to detect possible errors in the current frame. Next,
based on the gate activation, we rectify degraded features from its past
representation. Such a residual configuration alleviates the need for dedicated
memory and provides a continuous stream of relevant instance features.
Secondly, we propose a novel inter-instance interaction using gate activation
as a mask for self-attention. This masking strategy dynamically restricts the
unrepresentative instance queries in the self-attention and preserves vital
information for long-term tracking. We refer to this novel combination of Gated
Residual Connection and Masked Self-Attention as \textbf{GRAtt} block, which
can easily be integrated into the existing propagation-based framework.
Further, GRAtt blocks significantly reduce the attention overhead and simplify
dynamic temporal modeling. GRAtt-VIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
YouTube-VIS and the highly challenging OVIS dataset, significantly improving
over previous methods. Code is available at

This allows us to define a resource theory, where linear optical operations are
`free' (i.e., do not increase the rank), and the simulation complexity for an
$m$-mode system scales quadratically in $m$, in stark contrast to the Hilbert
space dimension. We outline this approach explicitly in the Fock basis,
relevant in particular for Boson sampling, where the simulation time (space)
complexity for computing output amplitudes, to arbitrary accuracy, scales as
$O(m^2 2^n)$ ($O(m2^n)$), for $n$ photons distributed amongst $m$ modes. We
additionally demonstrate linear optical simulations with the $n$ photons

provides a practical notion of `non-classicality', i.e., the classical

these methods not only require a multi-round prompting manner with a high time
overhead and computational cost, but also require elaborate prompt templates,
that are difficult to apply in practical scenarios. In this paper, we unify
entity locating and entity typing into prompt learning, and design a dual-slot
multi-prompt template with the position slot and type slot to prompt locating

simultaneously, and then the model extracts all entities by parallel
predictions on the slots. To assign labels for the slots during training, we
design a dynamic template filling mechanism that uses the extended bipartite

Therefore, this study aims to understand the impact on the software development
context with a focus on understanding the behavioral signs of self-efficacy in
software engineers and how self-efficacy can impact the work-day of software
engineers. METHOD: A qualitative research was conducted using semi-structured
questionnaires with 31 interviewees from a software development company located
in Brazil. The interviewees participated in a Bootcamp and were later assigned
to software development teams. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: In the perception of the interviewees, 21 signs were found that are
related to people with high and low self-efficacy. These signs were divided
into two dimensions: social and cognitive. Also, 18 situations were found that
can lead to an increase or decrease of self-efficacy of software engineers.

$\alpha$-particle radiopharmaceutical therapies ($\alpha$-RPTs). However,
quantitative SPECT for $\alpha$-RPT is challenging due to the low number of
detected counts, the complex emission spectrum, and other image-degrading
artifacts. Towards addressing these challenges, we propose a low-count
quantitative SPECT reconstruction method for isotopes with multiple emission
peaks.
  Given the low-count setting, it is important that the reconstruction method
extract the maximal possible information from each detected photon. Processing
data over multiple energy windows and in list-mode (LM) format provide
mechanisms to achieve that objective. Towards this goal, we propose a list-mode
multi-energy window (LM-MEW) OSEM-based SPECT reconstruction method that uses
data from multiple energy windows in LM format, and includes the energy
attribute of each detected photon. For computational efficiency, we developed a
multi-GPU-based implementation of this method. The method was evaluated using
2-D SPECT simulation studies in a single-scatter setting conducted in the
context of imaging [$^{223}$Ra]RaCl${_2}$.
  The proposed method yielded improved performance on the task of estimating
activity uptake within known regions of interest in comparison to approaches
that use a single energy window or use binned data. The improved performance
was observed in terms of both accuracy and precision and for different sizes of
the region of interest.
  Results of our studies show that the use of multiple energy windows and
processing data in LM format with the proposed LM-MEW method led to improved
quantification performance in low-count SPECT of isotopes with multiple
emission peaks. These results motivate further development and validation of
the LM-MEW method for such imaging applications, including for $\alpha$-RPT

  To evaluate LLM performance, OpenAI's GPT-3, GPT-4, Bing's Prometheus, and a

on accuracy, relevance, and readability (rated 1-3).
  The RetA model performed best in accuracy (12/19 3-point scores, total=47)

  Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 had more hallucinations in all 19 responses compared
to the RetA model and Prometheus. Hallucinations were mostly associated with
non-existent references or fabricated efficacy data.
  These findings suggest that RetA models, supplemented with domain-specific

are currently being investigated in several clinical and pre-clinical studies.
After administration, Thorium-227 decays to Radium-223, another
alpha-particle-emitting isotope, which redistributes within the patient.
Reliable dose quantification of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 is clinically
important, and SPECT can perform this quantification as these isotopes also
emit gamma-ray photons. However, reliable quantification is challenging for
several reasons: the orders-of-magnitude lower activity compared to
conventional SPECT, resulting in a very low number of detected counts, the
presence of multiple photopeaks and substantial overlap in the emission spectra
of these isotopes. To address these issues, we propose a multiple-energy-window
projection-domain quantification (MEW-PDQ) method that jointly estimates the
regional activity uptake of both Thorium-227 and Radium-223 directly using the
SPECT projection data from multiple energy windows. We evaluated the method
with realistic simulation studies conducted with anthropomorphic digital
phantoms, including a virtual imaging trial in the context of imaging patients
with bone metastases of prostate cancer who were treated with Thorium-227-based
alpha-RPTs. The proposed method yielded reliable regional uptake estimates of
both isotopes and outperformed state-of-art methods across different lesion
sizes, contrasts, and varying levels of intra-lesion heterogeneity. This
superior performance was also observed in the virtual imaging trial.
Additionally, the variance of the estimated uptake approached the Cram\'er-Rao
lower bound-defined theoretical limit. These results provide strong evidence in
support of this method for reliable uptake quantification in Thorium-227-based
alpha-RPTs.

resources. One crucial memory bottleneck for the deployment stems from the

however, the size of key-value embedding stored during the generation process
(KV cache) can easily surpass the model size. The enormous size of the KV cache
puts constraints on the inference batch size, which is crucial for high
throughput inference workload. Inspired by an interesting observation of the
attention scores, we hypothesize the persistence of importance: only pivotal
tokens, which had a substantial influence at one step, will significantly
influence future generations. Based on our empirical verification and
theoretical analysis around this hypothesis, we propose Scissorhands, a system
that maintains the memory usage of the KV cache at a fixed budget without
finetuning the model. In essence, Scissorhands manages the KV cache by storing
the pivotal tokens with a higher probability. We validate that Scissorhands
reduces the inference memory usage of the KV cache by up to 5X without
compromising model quality. We further demonstrate that Scissorhands can be
combined with 4-bit quantization, traditionally used to compress model weights,
to achieve up to 20X compression.

projection can reduce the dimension of a data set and approximately preserve
pairwise distances. If a distance being approximately preserved is called a
success, and the complement of this event is called a failure, then such a
random projection likely results in no failures. Assuming a Gaussian random
projection, the lemma is proved by showing that the no-failure probability is
positive using a combination of Bonferroni's inequality and Markov's
inequality. This paper modifies this proof in two ways to obtain a greater
lower bound on the no-failure probability. First, Bonferroni's inequality is
applied to pairs of failures instead of individual failures. Second, since a
pair of projection errors has a bivariate gamma distribution, the probability
of a pair of successes is bounded using an inequality from Jensen (1969). If
$n$ is the number of points to be embedded and $\mu$ is the probability of a
success, then this leads to an increase in the lower bound on the no-failure
probability of $\frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{2}(1-\mu)^2$ if $\binom{n}{2}$ is even and
$\frac{1}{2}\left(\binom{n}{2}-1\right)(1-\mu)^2$ if $\binom{n}{2}$ is odd. For
example, if $n=10^5$ points are to be embedded in $k=10^4$ dimensions with a
tolerance of $\epsilon=0.1$, then the improvement in the lower bound is on the
order of $10^{-14}$. We also show that further improvement is possible if the
inequality in Jensen (1969) extends to three successes, though we do not have a
proof of this result.

this work, we take an initial step towards removing this dependency by
proposing a closed-loop framework, referred to as LLMs As Tool Makers (LATM),
where LLMs create their own reusable tools for problem-solving. Our approach
consists of two key phases: 1) tool making: an LLM acts as the tool maker that
crafts tools for given tasks, where a tool is implemented as a Python utility
function. 2) tool using: an LLM acts as the tool user, which applies the tool
built by the tool maker for problem-solving. The tool user can be either the
same or a different LLM from the tool maker. Tool-making enables an LLM to
continually generate tools that can be applied to different requests so that
future requests can call the corresponding APIs when beneficial for solving the
tasks. Furthermore, the division of labor among LLMs for tool-making and
tool-using phases introduces the opportunity to achieve cost effectiveness
without degrading the quality of generated tools and problem solutions. For
example, recognizing that tool-making demands more sophisticated capabilities
than tool-using, we can apply a powerful yet resource-intensive model as the
tool maker, and a lightweight while cost-effective model as the tool user. We
validate the effectiveness of our approach across a variety of complex
reasoning tasks, including Big-Bench tasks. With GPT-4 as the tool maker and
GPT-3.5 as the tool user, LATM can achieve performance that is on par with
using GPT-4 for both tool making and tool using, while the inference cost is

semantic change). We propose interpretable metrics for all three drift
dimensions, and we modify past performance prediction methods to predict model
performance at both the example and dataset level for English sentiment

Beyond its dramatic, dusty nucleus, it also hosts an outer gas disk that
counter-rotates relative to its stars. The mass of this outer disk is
comparable to the gas content of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), prompting
the idea that it was likely accreted in a recent minor merger. Yet, detailed
follow-up studies of M64's outer disk have shown no evidence of such an event,
leading to other interpretations, such as a ""flyby"" interaction with the
distant diffuse satellite Coma P. We present Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
observations of M64's stellar halo, which resolve its stellar populations and
reveal a spectacular radial shell feature, oriented $\sim$30$^{\circ}$ relative
to the major axis and along the rotation axis of the outer gas disk. The shell
is $\sim$45 kpc southeast of M64, while a similar but more diffuse plume to the
northwest extends to $>$100 kpc. We estimate a stellar mass and metallicity for
the southern shell of $M_{\star} {=} 1.80~{\pm}~0.54{\times}10^8~M_{\odot}$ and
[M/H] $=$ $-$1.0, respectively, and a similar mass of
$1.42~{\pm}~0.71{\times}10^8 M_{\odot}$ for the northern plume. Taking into
account the accreted material in M64's inner disk, we estimate a total stellar
mass for the progenitor satellite of $M_{\rm
\star,prog}~{\simeq}~5{\times}10^8~M_{\odot}$. These results suggest that M64
is in the final stages of a minor merger with a gas-rich satellite strikingly
similar to the SMC, in which M64's accreted counter-rotating gas originated,
and which is responsible for the formation of its dusty inner star-forming
disk.

Initially, we employed various data preprocessing techniques such as outlier
rejection, missing value imputation, data standardization, and data sampling.
Then, seven machine learning (ML) classifiers including Support Vector Machine
(SVM), XGBoost (XGB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Decision Tree
(DT), Random Forest (RF), ExtraTrees (ET), and K-Neighbors were implemented.
These models were evaluated and then optimized by hyperparameter tuning using
the grid search technique. Finally, we analyzed the performance of our proposed
ETSE model. The performance analysis of each model revealed that our proposed
ETSE model outperformed the other models with 100% precision, 100% recall, 100%

leveraging the Kepler lightcurve together with a stellar density prior,
constructed using metallicity from spectroscopy, Ks magnitude from 2MASS, and
stellar parallax from Gaia. Within a Bayesian hierarchical framework, we
extract the underlying eccentricity distribution, assuming alternately
Rayleigh, half-Gaussian, and Beta functions for both single- and multi-transit
systems. We describe the eccentricity distribution for apparently
single-transiting planetary systems with a Rayleigh distribution with sigma =
0.19 (+0.04, -0.03), and for multi-transit systems with sigma = 0.03 (+0.02,
-0.01). The data suggest the possibility of distinct dynamically warmer and
cooler sub-populations within the single-transit distribution: The
single-transit data prefer a mixture model composed of two distinct Rayleigh
distributions with sigma_1 = 0.02 (+0.11, -0.00) and sigma_2 = 0.24 (+0.20,
-0.03) over a single Rayleigh distribution, with 7:1 odds. We contextualize our
findings within a planet formation framework, by comparing them to analogous

derived eccentricity distribution with other M dwarf demographic constraints,
we estimate the underlying eccentricity distribution for the population of

during its evolutionary history. Thus galaxy morphologies have been a long used
tool to gain insights on galaxy evolution. We visually classify morphologies on
cloud-scales based on the molecular gas distribution of a large sample of 79
nearby main-sequence galaxies, using 1'' resolution CO(2-1) ALMA observations
taken as part of the PHANGS survey. To do so, we devise a morphology
classification scheme for different types of bars, spiral arms (grand-design,
flocculent, multi-arm and smooth), rings (central and non-central rings)
similar to the well-established optical ones, and further introduce bar lane
classes. In general, our cold gas based morphologies agree well with the ones
based on stellar light. Both our bars as well as grand-design spiral arms are
preferentially found at the higher mass end of our sample. Our gas-based
classification indicates a potential for misidentification of unbarred galaxies
in the optical when massive star formation is present. Central or nuclear rings
are present in a third of the sample with a strong preferences for barred
galaxies (59%). As stellar bars are present in 45$\pm$5% of our sample
galaxies, we explore the utility of molecular gas as tracer of bar lane
properties. We find that more curved bar lanes have a shorter radial extent in
molecular gas and reside in galaxies with lower molecular to stellar mass
ratios than those with straighter geometries. Galaxies display a wide range of
CO morphology, and this work provides a catalogue of morphological features in
a representative sample of nearby galaxies.

Multi-Stage Monte Carlo Tree Search (MS-MCTS) method to solve non-monotone

decouples the complex problem into simpler subproblems using an object stage

MCTS paradigm, our method produces optimistic solutions by balancing
exploration and exploitation. The experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the existing methods regarding the planning time, the number of

more massive than around 1.2 solar masses. The characteristics of the cores
have a strong impact on the evolution and structure of the star. However, such
results rely on stellar evolution codes in which simplistic assumptions are
often made on the physics in the core. Indeed, the mixing is commonly
considered to be instantaneous and the most basic nuclear networks assume
beryllium at its equilibrium abundance. Those assumptions lead to significant
differences in the central composition of the elements for which the timescale
to reach nuclear equilibrium is lower than the convective timescale. In this
work, we show that those discrepancies impact the nuclear energy production and
therefore the size of convective cores in models computed with overshoot. We
find that cores computed with instantaneous mixing are up to 30% bigger than
those computed with diffusive mixing. Similar differences are found when using
basic nuclear networks. Additionally, we observe an extension of the duration
of the main sequence due to those core size differences. We then investigate
the impact of those structural differences on the seismic modeling of
solar-like oscillators. Modeling two stars observed by Kepler, we find that the
overshoot parameter of the best models computed with a basic nuclear network is
significantly lower compared to models computed with a full nuclear network.
This work is a necessary step for a better modeling of convective cores which
is key to determine accurate ages in the framework of future space missions
such as Plato.

inequality is a current area of debate. The evolutionary path to or away from
wealth sharing is also a subject of active research. In order to investigate
effects and evolution of wealth sharing, societies are simulated using a
minimal model of a complex adapting system. These simulations demonstrate, for
this artificial foraging society, that local sharing of resources reduces the
economy's total wealth and increases wealth inequality. Evolutionary pressures
strongly select against local sharing, whether globally or within a
individual's clan, and select for asocial behaviors. By holding constant the
gene for sharing resources among neighbors, from rich to poor, either with
everyone or only within members of the same clan, social behavior is selected
but total wealth and mean age are substantially reduced relative to non-sharing
societies. The Gini coefficient is shown to be ineffective in measuring these
changes in total wealth and wealth distributions, and, therefore, individual
well-being. Only with sociality do strategies emerge that allow sharing clans
to exclude or coexist with non-sharing clans. These strategies are based on
spatial effects, emphasizing the importance of modeling movement mediated
community assembly and coexistence as well as sociality.

technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input

we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to
exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the
potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still
retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers
(SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder
designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential
of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian
signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be
applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two
principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower
layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the
lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design
according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the
effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More
importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA
over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced
receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the
door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond

it is necessary to constrain communication bandwidth, and prior work has done
so by restricting the number of other cooperative vehicles and randomly
selecting the subset of vehicles to exchange information with from all those

communication perspective, this selection approach suffers from its
susceptibility to missing those vehicles that possess the perception
information most critical to navigation planning. Inspired by recent

significant attention from theory to experiment. However, even in its simplest
form, the 2D checkerboard lattice QBT model, the phase diagram characterized by
temperature and interaction strength still remains unknown beyond the
weak-coupling regime. Intense debates persist regarding the existence of
various interaction-driven insulating states in this system [1-7]. To address
these uncertainties, we employ thermal tensor network simulations, specifically
exponential tensor renormalization group [8], along with density matrix
renormalization group calculations. Our approach enables us to provide a
comprehensive finite-temperature phase diagram for this model and shed light on
previous ambiguities. Notably, our findings consistently reveal the emergence
of a robust bond-nematic Dirac semimetal (BNDS) phase as an intermediate state
between the nematic insulating state and other symmetry broken states. This
previously overlooked feature is found to be ubiquitous in interacting QBT
systems. We also discuss the implications of these results for experimental
systems such as bilayer graphene and iridate compounds.

dosage is an integer choice t in (0, 1, . . . , T), T being a specified maximum

information, including messages requesting help. This can be valuable to
emergency responders, who need to categorise and prioritise these messages
based on the type of assistance being requested. However, the high volume of
messages makes it difficult to filter and prioritise them without the use of
computational techniques. Fully supervised filtering techniques for crisis
message categorisation typically require a large amount of annotated training
data, but this can be difficult to obtain during an ongoing crisis and is
expensive in terms of time and labour to create.
  This thesis focuses on addressing the challenge of low data availability when
categorising crisis messages for emergency response. It first presents domain
adaptation as a solution for this problem, which involves learning a
categorisation model from annotated data from past crisis events (source
domain) and adapting it to categorise messages from an ongoing crisis event
(target domain). In many-to-many adaptation, where the model is trained on
multiple past events and adapted to multiple ongoing events, a multi-task
learning approach is proposed using pre-trained language models. This approach
outperforms baselines and an ensemble approach further improves performance...

Resonance Imaging (fMRI) presents an intriguing intersection between cognitive

However, the task is challenging due to the noisy nature of fMRI signals and
the intricate pattern of brain visual representations. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce a two-phase fMRI representation learning framework.
The first phase pre-trains an fMRI feature learner with a proposed
Double-contrastive Mask Auto-encoder to learn denoised representations. The
second phase tunes the feature learner to attend to neural activation patterns
most informative for visual reconstruction with guidance from an image
auto-encoder. The optimized fMRI feature learner then conditions a latent
diffusion model to reconstruct image stimuli from brain activities.
Experimental results demonstrate our model's superiority in generating
high-resolution and semantically accurate images, substantially exceeding
previous state-of-the-art methods by 39.34% in the 50-way-top-1 semantic

energies. In this article, we utilize one such passive deforming quadrotor,
XPLORER, to complete various contact-rich tasks by exploiting its compliant
chassis via various impact-aware planning and control algorithms. At the core
of these algorithms is a novel external wrench estimation technique developed
specifically for the unique multi-linked structure of XPLORER's chassis. The
external wrench information is then employed for designing interaction
controllers to obtain three additional flight modes: static-wrench application,
disturbance rejection and yielding to the disturbance. These modes are then
incorporated into a novel online exploration scheme to enable navigation in
unknown flight spaces with only tactile feedback and generate a map of the
environment without requiring additional sensors. Experiments show the efficacy
of this scheme to generate maps of the previously unexplored flight space with
an accuracy of 96.72%. Finally, we develop a novel collision-aware trajectory
planner (CATAAN) to generate minimum time maneuvers for waypoint tracking by
integrating collision-induced state jumps for both elastic and inelastic cases.
We experimentally validate that minimum time trajectories can be obtained with

first ingeniously proposes template voxel aggregation (TVA) module, effectively
transforming multi-view 2D images into 3D voxel features. By leveraging
associated camera poses, these features are aggregated into a compact 3D

the FL paradigm can be especially beneficial for clients that have little

propose an evaluation setup to study this task, where we re-purpose widely-used
single-domain text-to-SQL datasets as clients to form a realistic heterogeneous

suffer from the high client heterogeneity in our realistic setup, we further
propose a novel LOss Reduction Adjusted Re-weighting (Lorar) mechanism to
mitigate the performance degradation, which adjusts each client's contribution
to the global model update based on its training loss reduction during each
round. Our intuition is that the larger the loss reduction, the further away
the current global model is from the client's local optimum, and the larger
weight the client should get. By applying Lorar to three widely adopted FL
algorithms (FedAvg, FedOPT and FedProx), we observe that their performance can
be improved substantially on average (4%-20% absolute gain under MacroAvg) and
that clients with smaller datasets enjoy larger performance gains. In addition,
the global model converges faster for almost all the clients.

max-min fairness loses one or more of these properties.
  We present Karma, a generalization of max-min fairness for dynamic user

account: in each quantum, users donate their unused resources and are assigned
credits when other users borrow these resources; Karma carefully orchestrates
exchange of credits across users (based on their instantaneous demands, donated
resources and borrowed resources), and performs prioritized resource allocation
based on users' credits. We prove theoretically that Karma guarantees Pareto

Karma is able to reduce disparity in performance across users to a bare minimum

problem is commonly solved using non-convex gradient descent, due to its
ability to scale to large-scale real-world datasets. In theory, non-convex
gradient descent is capable of achieving minimax error. But in practice, it
often converges extremely slowly, such that it cannot even deliver estimations
of modest accuracy within reasonable time. On the other hand, methods that
improve the convergence of non-convex gradient descent, through rescaling or
preconditioning, also greatly amplify the measurement noise, resulting in
estimations that are orders of magnitude less accurate than what is
theoretically achievable with minimax optimal error. In this paper, we propose
a slight modification to the usual non-convex gradient descent method that
remedies the issue of slow convergence, while provably preserving its minimax
optimality. Our proposed algorithm has essentially the same per-iteration cost

variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks.
However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high
computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To
date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies
that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is
little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an
efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for
obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on
the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression
solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For
compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach
can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters.
Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of
text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\times$
speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\times$ reduction) than the

purpose of electing representatives. How the districts are drawn can affect
who's elected, and drawing districts to give an advantage to a certain group is
known as gerrymandering. It can be surprisingly difficult to detect
gerrymandering, but one algorithmic method is to compare a current districting
plan to a large number of randomly sampled plans to see whether it is an
outlier. Recombination Markov chains are often used for this random sampling:
randomly choose two districts, consider their union, and split this union in a
new way. This works well in practice, but the theory behind it remains
underdeveloped. For example, it's not known if recombination Markov chains are
irreducible, that is, if recombination moves suffice to move from any
districting plan to any other.
  Irreducibility of recombination Markov chains can be formulated as a graph
problem: for a graph $G$, is the space of all partitions of $G$ into $k$
connected subgraphs ($k$ districts) connected by recombination moves? We
consider three simply connected districts and district sizes $k_1\pm 1$

investigating the reliance of LLMs on shortcuts or spurious correlations within

this system are synchronous with the phase of the orbital period. We have used
the observed variations of Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$ to derive the orbital
inclination $i$, orientation $\Omega$, and the direction of rotation. In order
to determine the contribution from interstellar polarization, we have carried
out new observations of polarization of field stars with precisely measured
parallaxes.
  The variations of Stokes parameters in all three $B$, $V$, and $R$ passbands
clearly exhibit an unambiguous periodic signal at 1.055 d with the amplitude of
variations $\sim$$0.2\%$ which corresponds to half of known orbital period of
2.11 d. This type of polarization variability is expected for a binary system
with light scattering material distributed symmetrically with respect to the
orbital plane. Even though most of the observed polarization ($\sim$2$\%$) is
of interstellar origin, about one third of it is due to the intrinsic
component. In addition to the regular polarization variability, there is a
non-periodic component, strongest in the $B$ passband. We obtained in the $V$
passband our most reliable values for the orbital inclination $i =
46^{\circ}+11^{\circ}/-46^{\circ}$ and the orientation of the orbit on the sky

introduce a suite of three benchmarks to test the generalization properties of
a visual in-context learner. We formalize the notion of an analogy-based
in-context learner and use it to design a meta-learning framework called
Im-Promptu. Whereas the requisite token granularity for language is well
established, the appropriate compositional granularity for enabling in-context

Im-Promptu to train multiple agents with different levels of compositionality,

experiments reveal tradeoffs between extrapolation abilities and the degree of
compositionality, with non-compositional representations extending learned
composition rules to unseen domains but performing poorly on combinatorial

disappears. Building on previous work on interval-partition-valued processes,
we construct this conjectured process via a consistent system of stationary
evolutions of binary trees with k labeled leaves and edges decorated with
interval partitions. The interval partitions are scaled Poisson-Dirichlet
interval partitions whose interval lengths record subtree masses. They also
possess a diversity property that captures certain distances in the continuum
tree. Continuously evolving diversities give access to continuously evolving
continuum tree distances. The pathwise construction allows us to study this
""Aldous diffusion"" in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov space of rooted, weighted
R-trees. We establish the simple Markov property and path-continuity. The
Aldous diffusion is stationary with the distribution of the Brownian continuum
random tree. While the Brownian CRT is a.s. binary, we show that there is a
dense null set of exceptional times when the Aldous diffusion has a ternary
branch point, including stopping times at which the strong Markov property

periodic boundary conditions have been developed and are now extensively used
in condensed matter physics and materials science research. Only in 2016,
however, their precision (i.e., to which extent properties computed with
different codes agree among each other) was systematically assessed on
elemental crystals: a first crucial step to evaluate the reliability of such
computations. We discuss here general recommendations for verification studies
aiming at further testing precision and transferability of
density-functional-theory computational approaches and codes. We illustrate
such recommendations using a greatly expanded protocol covering the whole
periodic table from Z=1 to 96 and characterizing 10 prototypical cubic
compounds for each element: 4 unaries and 6 oxides, spanning a wide range of
coordination numbers and oxidation states. The primary outcome is a reference
dataset of 960 equations of state cross-checked between two all-electron codes,
then used to verify and improve nine pseudopotential-based approaches. Such
effort is facilitated by deploying AiiDA common workflows that perform
automatic input parameter selection, provide identical input/output interfaces
across codes, and ensure full reproducibility. Finally, we discuss the extent
to which the current results for total energies can be reused for different
goals (e.g., obtaining formation energies).

converge locally when $S \succ 0$ and may diverge when $S=0$, where $S\succeq
0$ is the symmetric part of the Jacobian at equilibrium that accounts for the

soon as $S$ is nonzero (partial curvature) and the eigenvectors of the

$S$. We then study the convergence rates when $S \ll A$ and prove that they
typically depend on the average of the eigenvalues of $S$, instead of the
minimum as an analogy with minimization problems would suggest. To illustrate
our results, we consider the problem of computing mixed Nash equilibria of
continuous games. We show that, thanks to partial curvature, conic particle
methods -- which optimize over both weights and supports of the mixed
strategies -- generically converge faster than fixed-support methods. For
min-max games, it is thus beneficial to add degrees of freedom ""with

over-parameterization.

in the context of learning directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). These problems
involve minimizing a given loss or score function, subject to a non-convex
continuous constraint that penalizes the presence of cycles in a graph. In this
work, we delve into the optimization challenges associated with this class of
non-convex programs. To address these challenges, we propose a bi-level
algorithm that leverages the non-convex constraint in a novel way. The outer
level of the algorithm optimizes over topological orders by iteratively
swapping pairs of nodes within the topological order of a DAG. A key innovation
of our approach is the development of an effective method for generating a set
of candidate swapping pairs for each iteration. At the inner level, given a
topological order, we utilize off-the-shelf solvers that can handle linear
constraints. The key advantage of our proposed algorithm is that it is
guaranteed to find a local minimum or a KKT point under weaker conditions
compared to previous work and finds solutions with lower scores. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in terms of achieving a better score. Additionally, our method can also be used

object with an intermediate-mass black hole that is surrounded by a dark matter
density spike. The interaction of the inspiraling black hole with the dark
matter particles in the spike leads to dynamical friction. This can alter the
dynamics of the black hole binary, leaving an imprint on the gravitational wave
signal. Previous calculations did not include in the evaluation of the
dynamical friction coefficient the contribution from particles that move faster
than the black hole. This term is neglected in the standard Chandrasekhar's
treatment where only slower moving particles contribute to the decelerating
drag. Here, we demonstrate that dynamical friction produced by the fast moving
particles has a significant effect on the evolution of a massive binary within
a dark matter spike. For a density profile $\rho\propto r^{-\gamma}$ with
$\gamma\lesssim 1$, the dephasing of the gravitational waveform can be several
orders of magnitude larger than estimated using the standard treatment. As
$\gamma$ approaches $0.5$ the error becomes arbitrarily large. Finally, we show
that dynamical friction tends to make the orbit more eccentric for any $\gamma
< 1.8$. However, energy loss by gravitational wave radiation is expected to
dominate the inspiral, leading to orbital circularization in most cases.

stochastic algorithms whose per-iteration complexity is independent of $n$. Of
these, the incremental/stochastic variants of the Newton method exhibit
superlinear convergence, but incur a per-iteration complexity of $O(d^3)$,
which may be prohibitive in large-scale settings. On the other hand, the
incremental Quasi-Newton method incurs a per-iteration complexity of $O(d^2)$

asymptotically. This work puts forth the Sharpened Lazy Incremental

Building upon the recently proposed Sharpened Quasi-Newton method, the proposed

significant association between the format of architecture documentation and

is defined as the probability of collision with uncertain obstacles. Existing
approaches to address risk bounded trajectory planning problems either are
limited to Gaussian uncertainties and convex obstacles or rely on

To address the risk bounded trajectory planning problem, we leverage the notion

deterministic optimization is, in general, nonlinear and nonconvex time-varying

popularity of automatic machine analysis of images and video. As a result, a
growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision,
rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several
methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines.
Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding
rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine
analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for
machines, providing insight into important design considerations of
machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve
several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods
achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision
tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.

technical assumptions. These assumptions include having a well-conditioned
covariance matrix and having independent and identically distributed data.
These assumptions are not necessarily valid for real data. Additionally, prior

decision-making problems to broaden the applicability of algorithms.
Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) has recently emerged as one of the most
promising approaches for obtaining various types of adaptivity in bandit
problems. Aiming to further generalize this adaptivity, we develop a generic
adaptive learning rate, called Stability-Penalty-Adaptive (SPA) learning rate
for FTRL. This learning rate yields a regret bound jointly depending on
stability and penalty of the algorithm, into which the regret of FTRL is
typically decomposed. With this result, we establish several algorithms with
three types of adaptivity: sparsity, game-dependency, and Best-of-Both-Worlds
(BOBW). Sparsity frequently appears in real-world problems. However, existing
sparse multi-armed bandit algorithms with $k$-arms assume that the sparsity
level $s \leq k$ is known in advance, which is often not the case in real-world
scenarios. To address this problem, with the help of the new learning rate
framework, we establish $s$-agnostic algorithms with regret bounds of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{sT})$ in the adversarial regime for $T$ rounds, which matches
the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Meanwhile, BOBW algorithms
aim to achieve a near-optimal regret in both the stochastic and adversarial
regimes. Leveraging the new adaptive learning rate framework and a novel
analysis to bound the variation in FTRL output in response to changes in a
regularizer, we establish the first BOBW algorithm with a sparsity-dependent
bound. Additionally, we explore partial monitoring and demonstrate that the
proposed learning rate framework allows us to achieve a game-dependent bound

that can be efficiently fine-tuned to an unseen target domain with minimal
computational cost. We assume the interpretable component of NN to be
approximately domain-invariant. However, interpretable models typically
underperform compared to their Blackbox (BB) variants. We start with a BB in
the source domain and distill it into a \emph{mixture} of shallow interpretable
models using human-understandable concepts. As each interpretable model covers
a subset of data, a mixture of interpretable models achieves comparable
performance as BB. Further, we use the pseudo-labeling technique from
semi-supervised learning (SSL) to learn the concept classifier in the target

observe that complex reasoning is likely to be a key differentiator between

$\chi$ is the redshift factor of the spacetime. The Tolman law has been proven
for radiation in stationary spacetimes and for perfect fluids in stationary,
asymototically flat and axisymmetric spacetimes. It is unclear whether the
proof can be extended to more general cases. In this paper, we prove that under
some reasonable conditions, the Tolman law always holds for a perfect fluid in
a stationary spacetime. The key assumption in our proof is that the particle
number density $n$ can not be determined by the energy density $\rho$ and
pressure $p$ via the equations of state. This is true for many known fluids
with the equation of state $p=p(\rho)$. Then, by requiring that the total
entropy of the fluid is an extremum for the variation of $n$ with a fixed
metric, we prove the Tolman law. In our proof, only the conservations of stress
energy and the total particle number are used, and no field equations are
involved. Our work suggests that the Tolman law holds for a generic perfect

demand for advancing estimators is evident. We propose DotHash, an unbiased

estimate the Jaccard index and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
method that can also estimate the Adamic-Adar index and a family of related

by an asteroid tidally captured by a magnetar. In this model, an asteroid is
tidally captured and disrupted by a magnetar. Then, the disrupted asteroid will
transfer the angular momentum to the magnetar producing a sudden change in the
magnetar rotational frequency at the magnetosphere radius. If the orbital
angular momentum of the asteroid is parallel (or anti-parallel) to that of the
spinning magnetar, a glitch (or anti-glitch) will occur. Subsequently, the
bound asteroid materials fall back to the pericenter and eventually are
accreted to the surface of the magnetar. Massive fragments of the asteroid
cross magnetic field lines and produce bright radio bursts through coherent
curvature radiation. Our model can explain the sudden magnetar spin changes and
FRB-like bursts in a unified way.

they may be governed by an angular mode dependent net growth rate. We also
study the impact of anisotropies in the ejecta as well as in the CSM on the

density field (whether imposed on the ejecta or the CSM) do not influence the
anisotropy of the remnant significantly unless they have a very large amplitude
and form large-scale coherent structures. In any case, these clumps can only
affect structures on large angular scales. The power spectra on small angular
scales is completely independent of the initial clumpiness and only governed by
the growth and saturation of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

Regret Minimization (CFR) has been one of the most successful family of
algorithms for tackling IIGs. The integration of skill-based strategy learning
with CFR could potentially enhance learning performance for complex IIGs. For
this, a hierarchical strategy needs to be learnt, wherein low-level components
represent specific skills and the high-level component manages the transition

helping humans pinpoint scenarios where the agent is struggling and intervene

achieve this, we initially construct our algorithm on a tabular setting,

to the exponentially growing model size and inference cost that scales
quadratically with the number of tokens in the input sequence. Token pruning is
an emerging solution to address this challenge due to its ease of deployment on
various Transformer backbones. However, most token pruning methods require a
computationally-expensive fine-tuning process after or during pruning, which is
not desirable in many cases. Some recent works explore pruning of off-the-shelf
pre-trained Transformers without fine-tuning. However, they only take the
importance of tokens into consideration. In this work, we propose Zero-TPrune,
the first zero-shot method that considers both the importance and similarity of
tokens in performing token pruning. Zero-TPrune leverages the attention graph
of pre-trained Transformer models to produce an importance rank for tokens and
removes the less informative tokens. The attention matrix can be thought of as
an adjacency matrix of a directed graph, to which a graph shift operator can be
applied iteratively to obtain the importance score distribution. This
distribution guides the partition of tokens into two groups and measures
similarity between them. Due to the elimination of the fine-tuning overhead,
Zero-TPrune can easily prune large models and perform hyperparameter tuning
efficiently. We evaluate the performance of Zero-TPrune on vision tasks by
applying it to various vision Transformer backbones. Compared with
state-of-the-art pruning methods that require fine-tuning, Zero-TPrune not only
eliminates the need for fine-tuning after pruning, but does so with only around
0.3% accuracy loss. Compared with state-of-the-art fine-tuning-free pruning
methods, Zero-TPrune reduces accuracy loss by up to 45% on medium-sized models.

the so-called condensation threshold.
  Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more
complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random
regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak
limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit
exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of
solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters, a result

  Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation
$O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local
neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the
clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB
belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad
applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.

peer-review assignment--in order to mitigate fraud--as a valuable opportunity
to evaluate counterfactual assignment policies. Specifically, we exploit how
such randomized assignments provide a positive probability of observing the

applying standard off-policy evaluation methods, such as violations of

monotonicity and Lipschitz smoothness assumptions for the mapping between
reviewer-paper covariates and outcomes. We apply our methods to peer-review

consider estimates of (i) the effect on review quality when changing weights in

as general sequences. For this specific class of convex-concave functions, we
proved that the sequence of function values, taken over the averages of

However, their performance and accuracy are constrained by the incapability of

a novel approach to privacy-preserving PCA that addresses these limitations,

less prone to memory saturation in parallel computation scenarios. (ii)
Leveraging the benefits of this optimized matrix multiplication, we devise an

the underlying transition dynamics to show vulnerability of reinforcement
learning agents under adversarial attacks. However, such direct manipulation
may not always be feasible in practice. In this paper, we consider another
common and realistic attack setup: in a multi-agent RL setting with
well-trained agents, during deployment time, the victim agent $\nu$ is
exploited by an attacker who controls another agent $\alpha$ to act
adversarially against the victim using an \textit{adversarial policy}. Prior
attack models under such setup do not consider that the attacker can confront
resistance and thus can only take partial control of the agent $\alpha$, as
well as introducing perceivable ``abnormal'' behaviors that are easily
detectable. A provable defense against these adversarial policies is also
lacking. To resolve these issues, we introduce a more general attack
formulation that models to what extent the adversary is able to control the
agent to produce the adversarial policy. Based on such a generalized attack
framework, the attacker can also regulate the state distribution shift caused
by the attack through an attack budget, and thus produce stealthy adversarial
policies that can exploit the victim agent. Furthermore, we provide the first
provably robust defenses with convergence guarantee to the most robust victim
policy via adversarial training with timescale separation, in sharp contrast to
adversarial training in supervised learning which may only provide {\it
empirical} defenses.

under-explored unaligned setting, where the goal is to recognize audio and

labels only tell what events happen without knowing the modality they are

Label Elaboration (VALOR), is innovated to harvest modality labels for the
training events. Empirical studies show that the harvested labels significantly
improve an attentional baseline by 8.0 in average F-score (Type@AV).
Surprisingly, we found that modality-independent teachers outperform their

recover continuous-tone images from halftone images with only bilevel pixels.
Because the halftone images lose much of the original image content, inverse
halftoning is a classic ill-problem. Although existing inverse halftoning
algorithms achieve good performance, their results lose image details and
features. Therefore, it is still a challenge to recover high-quality
continuous-tone images. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end multiscale
progressively residual learning network (MSPRL), which has a UNet architecture
and takes multiscale input images. To make full use of different input image
information, we design a shallow feature extraction module to capture similar
features between images of different scales. We systematically study the
performance of different methods and compare them with our proposed method. In
addition, we employ different training strategies to optimize the model, which
is important for optimizing the training process and improving performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MSPRL model obtains considerable
performance gains in detail restoration.

clarified by comparing the results using the low energy constants estimated

training-based methods have limitations in flexibility, particularly when

N-Gram Analysis (DNA-GPT). Given a text, we first truncate it in the middle and
then use only the preceding portion as input to the LLMs to regenerate the new
remaining parts. By analyzing the differences between the original and new
remaining parts through N-gram analysis in black-box or probability divergence
in white-box, we can clearly illustrate significant discrepancies between
machine-generated and human-written text. We conducted extensive experiments on
the most advanced LLMs from OpenAI, including text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo,

Results show that our zero-shot approach exhibits state-of-the-art performance
in distinguishing between human and GPT-generated text on four English and one
German dataset, outperforming OpenAI's own classifier, which is trained on
millions of text. Additionally, our methods provide reasonable explanations and

that all FV arises from this type of couplings and assume that the Yukawa

datasets manually annotated by domain experts. Our experiments show that
automatic evaluation metrics can have substantially different behaviors on

$N(0,\Sigma)$ in multivariate Kolmogorov distance, the best-known error rate
has been $O(n^{-1/4})$, subject to logarithmic factors of the dimension. For
the strongly non-degenerate case, that is, when the minimum eigenvalue of

$O(n^{-1/2})$ up to a $\log n$ factor. In this paper, we show that the
$O(n^{-1/2})$ rate up to a $\log n$ factor can still be achieved in the

However, under complex illumination conditions, few algorithms pay attention to
the edge information of local regions which is crucial for downstream tasks. To
this end, we propose a fusion network based on the local edge enhancement,
named LE2Fusion. Specifically, a local edge enhancement (LE2) module is
proposed to improve the edge information under complex illumination conditions
and preserve the essential features of image. For feature extraction, a
multi-scale residual attention (MRA) module is applied to extract rich
features. Then, with LE2, a set of enhancement weights are generated which are
utilized in feature fusion strategy and used to guide the image reconstruction.
To better preserve the local detail information and structure information, the
pixel intensity loss function based on the local region is also presented. The
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits better fusion
performance than the state-of-the-art fusion methods on public datasets.

simultaneously containing salient features and rich texture details, which can
be used to boost downstream tasks. However, existing fusion methods are
suffering from the issues of texture loss and edge information deficiency,
which result in suboptimal fusion results. Meanwhile, the straight-forward
up-sampling operator can not well preserve the source information from
multi-scale features. To address these issues, a novel fusion network based on
the wavelet-guided pooling (wave-pooling) manner is proposed, termed as WavePF.
Specifically, a wave-pooling based encoder is designed to extract multi-scale
image and detail features of source images at the same time. In addition, the
spatial attention model is used to aggregate these salient features. After
that, the fused features will be reconstructed by the decoder, in which the
up-sampling operator is replaced by the wave-pooling reversed operation.
Different from the common max-pooling technique, image features after the
wave-pooling layer can retain abundant details information, which can benefit
the fusion process. In this case, rich texture details and multi-scale
information can be maintained during the reconstruction phase. The experimental
results demonstrate that our method exhibits superior fusion performance over

challenging authentication issue in the Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). However,
the consensus time and communication overhead of blockchain increase
significantly as the number of vehicles connected to the blockchain. To address
this issue, vehicular fog computing has been introduced to improve efficiency.
However, existing studies ignore several key factors such as the number of
vehicles in the fog computing system, which can impact the consensus
communication overhead. Meanwhile, there is no comprehensive study on the
stability of vehicular fog composition. The vehicle movement will lead to
dynamic changes in fog. If the composition of vehicular fog is unstable, the
blockchain formed by this fog computing system will be unstable, which can
affect the consensus efficiency. With the above considerations, we propose an
efficient and stable identity authentication (ESIA) empowered by hierarchical
blockchain and fog computing. By grouping vehicles efficiently, ESIA has low
communication complexity and achieves high stability. Moreover, to enhance the
consensus security of the hierarchical blockchain, the consensus process is
from the bottom layer to the up layer (bottom-up), which we call B2UHChain.
Through theoretical analysis and simulation verification, our scheme achieves
the design goals of high efficiency and stability while significantly improving
the IoV scalability to the power of 1.5 (^1.5) under similar security to a
single-layer blockchain. In addition, ESIA has less communication and
computation overhead, lower latency, and higher throughput than other baseline
authentication schemes.

TaReSi, with an energy gap $\Delta_0$ = 0.79 meV and a magnetic penetration
depth $\lambda_0$ = 562 nm. The absence of a spontaneous magnetization below
$T_c$, as confirmed by zero-field $\mu$SR, indicates a preserved time-reversal

relatively large band splitting due to the antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling.

By passing messages on the constructed hypergraphs based on our Hypergraph

to avert the distillation of inappropriate information for the SV. OS-KDFT
could downsize Wav2Vec 2.0 based ECAPA-TDNN size by approximately 76.2%, and
reduce the SSL model's inference time by 79% while presenting an EER of 0.98%.
The proposed OS-KDFT is validated across VoxCeleb1 and VoxCeleb2 datasets and

  Specifically, the study focuses on the investigation of various reproductive
variables such as the mating probability and the fertilized egg production in
the case of helminth parasites.
  While previous studies have commonly assumed Poisson and negative binomial
distributions to describe the distribution of parasites among hosts, this study
adopts an arbitrary distribution model and examines its consequences on some
reproductive variables. These variables include mean number of fertile females,
mean egg production, mating probability and mean fertilized egg production.
  In addition, the study of these variables takes into account the sex

considered to be distributed together or separately.
  We show that the models obtained for the case of male and female parasites
distributed separately in the hosts are ecologically unrealistic.

geometry and the BRDF of reflective objects from multiview images captured in
an unknown environment. Multiview reconstruction of reflective objects is
extremely challenging because specular reflections are view-dependent and thus
violate the multiview consistency, which is the cornerstone for most multiview
reconstruction methods. Recent neural rendering techniques can model the
interaction between environment lights and the object surfaces to fit the
view-dependent reflections, thus making it possible to reconstruct reflective
objects from multiview images. However, accurately modeling environment lights
in the neural rendering is intractable, especially when the geometry is
unknown. Most existing neural rendering methods, which can model environment
lights, only consider direct lights and rely on object masks to reconstruct
objects with weak specular reflections. Therefore, these methods fail to
reconstruct reflective objects, especially when the object mask is not
available and the object is illuminated by indirect lights. We propose a
two-step approach to tackle this problem. First, by applying the split-sum
approximation and the integrated directional encoding to approximate the
shading effects of both direct and indirect lights, we are able to accurately
reconstruct the geometry of reflective objects without any object masks. Then,
with the object geometry fixed, we use more accurate sampling to recover the
environment lights and the BRDF of the object. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of accurately reconstructing the
geometry and the BRDF of reflective objects from only posed RGB images without
knowing the environment lights and the object masks. Codes and datasets are

align RL agents' behavior with human desired outcomes, but is often restrained

a long-neglected issue in the query selection schemes of existing PbRL studies:
Query-Policy Misalignment. We show that the seemingly informative queries
selected to improve the overall quality of reward model actually may not align

eventually resulting in poor feedback efficiency. We show that this issue can
be effectively addressed via near on-policy query and a specially designed
hybrid experience replay, which together enforce the bidirectional query-policy

widely used in practice for allocating goods such as carbon licenses. In each
round, $K$ identical units of a good are sold to a group of buyers that have
valuations with diminishing marginal returns. The buyers submit bids for the
units, and then a price $p$ is set per unit so that all the units are sold. We
consider two variants of the auction, where the price is set to the $K$-th
highest bid and $(K+1)$-st highest bid, respectively.
  We analyze the properties of this auction in both the offline and online
settings. In the offline setting, we consider the problem that one player $i$
is facing: given access to a data set that contains the bids submitted by
competitors in past auctions, find a bid vector that maximizes player $i$'s
cumulative utility on the data set. We design a polynomial time algorithm for
this problem, by showing it is equivalent to finding a maximum-weight path on a
carefully constructed directed acyclic graph.
  In the online setting, the players run learning algorithms to update their
bids as they participate in the auction over time. Based on our offline
algorithm, we design efficient online learning algorithms for bidding. The
algorithms have sublinear regret, under both full information and bandit
feedback structures. We complement our online learning algorithms with regret
lower bounds.
  Finally, we analyze the quality of the equilibria in the worst case through
the lens of the core solution concept in the game among the bidders. We show
that the $(K+1)$-st price format is susceptible to collusion among the bidders;

high information transfer rate (ITR) in the current methods requires an
extensive calibration period before using the system, leading to discomfort for
new users. We address this issue by proposing a method that adapts the deep
neural network (DNN) pre-trained on data from source domains (participants of
previous experiments conducted for labeled data collection), using only the
unlabeled data of the new user (target domain). This adaptation is achieved by
minimizing our proposed custom loss function composed of self-adaptation and
local-regularity loss terms. The self-adaptation term uses the pseudo-label
strategy, while the novel local-regularity term exploits the data structure and
forces the DNN to assign the same labels to adjacent instances. Our method
achieves striking 201.15 bits/min and 145.02 bits/min ITRs on the benchmark and

thermodynamic modeling, itself based on values for the free energy of formation
of P$_4$O$_6$ estimated from limited experimental data. Values of the standard
Gibbs free energy of formation ($\Delta$Go(g)) of P$_4$O$_6$ in the literature
differ by up to ~656 kJ/mol, a huge range. Depending on which value is assumed,
P$_4$O$_6$ may either be the majority phosphorus species present or be
completely absent from modeled atmospheres. Here, we critically review the
literature thermodynamic values and compare their predictions to observed
constraints on P$_4$O$_6$ geochemistry. We conclude that the widely used values
from the NIST/JANAF database are almost certainly too low (predicting that
P$_4$O$_6$ is more stable than is plausible). We show that, regardless of the
value of $\Delta$Go(g) for P$_4$O$_6$ assumed, the formation of phosphine from
P$_4$O$_6$ in the Venusian atmosphere is thermodynamically unfavorable. We
conclude that there is a need for more robust data on both the thermodynamics
of phosphorus chemistry for astronomical and geological modeling in general and
for understanding the atmosphere of Venus and the gas giant planets in
particular.

class-selective neurons in their early and intermediate layers. Intriguingly,
recent studies have shown that these class-selective neurons can be ablated
without deteriorating network function. But if class-selective neurons are not
necessary, why do they exist? We attempt to answer this question in a series of
experiments on ResNet-50s trained on ImageNet. We first show that
class-selective neurons emerge during the first few epochs of training, before
receding rapidly but not completely; this suggests that class-selective neurons
found in trained networks are in fact vestigial remains of early training. With
single-neuron ablation experiments, we then show that class-selective neurons
are important for network function in this early phase of training. We also
observe that the network is close to a linear regime in this early phase; we
thus speculate that class-selective neurons appear early in training as
quasi-linear shortcut solutions to the classification task. Finally, in causal
experiments where we regularize against class selectivity at different points
in training, we show that the presence of class-selective neurons early in
training is critical to the successful training of the network; in contrast,
class-selective neurons can be suppressed later in training with little effect
on final accuracy. It remains to be understood by which mechanism the presence
of class-selective neurons in the early phase of training contributes to the
successful training of networks.

address these challenges, this paper first proposes an energy sharing mechanism

Externally, the two systems are engaged in a Nash game because traffic flows
serve as electric demands as a result of charging behaviors, and each driver
pays the energy sharing price for charging. The nested game is then converted
into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) with the help of optimality
conditions and linearization techniques. Numerical experiments validate the
theoretical results and show the mutual impact between the two systems.

increasingly urgent to design efficient methods or algorithms to solve AAR
problems in complicated aerial environments. Apart from the complex aerodynamic
disturbance, another problem is the pose estimation error caused by the camera
calibration error, installation error, or 3D object modeling error, which may
not satisfy the highly accurate docking. The main objective of the effort
described in this paper is the implementation of an image-based visual servo
control method, which contains the establishment of an image-based visual servo

relevant texts, providing useful supplementary information for translation.
Moreover, we present a multi-stage training framework involving text machine

FoPro-KD comprises three modules: Fourier prompt generator (FPG), effective
knowledge distillation (EKD), and adversarial knowledge distillation (AKD). The
FPG module learns to generate targeted perturbations conditional on a target
dataset, exploring the representations of a frozen pre-trained model, trained
on natural images. The EKD module exploits these generalizable representations
through distillation to a smaller target model, while the AKD module further
enhances the distillation process. Through these modules, FoPro-KD achieves
significant improvements in performance on long-tailed medical image

  Diffusion Inference","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the recent success of diffusion models, text-to-image generation is
becoming increasingly popular and achieves a wide range of applications. Among
them, text-to-image editing, or continuous text-to-image generation, attracts
lots of attention and can potentially improve the quality of generated images.
It's common to see that users may want to slightly edit the generated image by
making minor modifications to their input textual descriptions for several
rounds of diffusion inference. However, such an image editing process suffers
from the low inference efficiency of many existing diffusion models even using
GPU accelerators. To solve this problem, we introduce Fast Image Semantically
Edit (FISEdit), a cached-enabled sparse diffusion model inference engine for
efficient text-to-image editing. The key intuition behind our approach is to
utilize the semantic mapping between the minor modifications on the input text
and the affected regions on the output image. For each text editing step,
FISEdit can automatically identify the affected image regions and utilize the
cached unchanged regions' feature map to accelerate the inference process.
Extensive empirical results show that FISEdit can be $3.4\times$ and
$4.4\times$ faster than existing methods on NVIDIA TITAN RTX and A100 GPUs
respectively, and even generates more satisfactory images.

composed of two 50 cm aperture Cassegrain antennas mounted on a common
equatorial mount, with a separation of 230 wavelengths. The cross-correlation
of the received signals effectively cancels the quiet solar component of the
large flux density (~3000 sfu) that reduces the detection limit due to
atmospheric fluctuations. The system performance is obtained as follows: the
noise factor of the AFE in the observation band is less than 2.1 dB, system
sensitivity is approximately 12.4 K (~34 sfu) with an integration time constant
of 0.1 ms (default), the frequency resolution is 153 kHz, and the dynamic range
is larger than 30 dB. Through actual testing, the nulling interferometer
observes a quiet sun with a low level of output fluctuations (of up to 50 sfu)
and has a significantly lower radiation flux variability (of up to 190 sfu)
than an equivalent single-antenna system, even under thick cloud cover. As a
result, this new design can effectively improve observation sensitivity by
reducing the impact of atmospheric and system fluctuations during observation.

Magnetohydrodynamic stellar wind models can improve our understanding of this

that the inconsistent problem is caused by newly added modules into TTI models
for learning temporal information. These modules lead to covariate shift in the
feature space, which harms the editing capability. Thus, we design EI$^2$ to
tackle the above drawbacks with two classical modules: Shift-restricted
Temporal Attention Module (STAM) and Fine-coarse Frame Attention Module (FFAM).
First, through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that covariate shift is
highly related to Layer Normalization, thus STAM employs a \textit{Instance
Centering} layer replacing it to preserve the distribution of temporal
features. In addition, {STAM} employs an attention layer with normalized
mapping to transform temporal features while constraining the variance shift.
As the second part, we incorporate {STAM} with a novel {FFAM}, which
efficiently leverages fine-coarse spatial information of overall frames to
further enhance temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed EI$^2$ model for text-driven video editing.

sketching-based algorithm for efficiently computing the partial SVD of a large
matrix. When the matrix is low-rank, the R-SVD produces its partial SVD
exactly; but when the rank is large, it only yields an approximation.
  Motivated by applications in data science and principal component analysis
(PCA), we analyze the R-SVD under a low-rank signal plus noise measurement
model; specifically, when its input is a spiked random matrix. The singular
values produced by the R-SVD are shown to exhibit a BBP-like phase transition:
when the SNR exceeds a certain detectability threshold, that depends on the
dimension reduction factor, the largest singular value is an outlier; below the
threshold, no outlier emerges from the bulk of singular values. We further
compute asymptotic formulas for the overlap between the ground truth signal
singular vectors and the approximations produced by the R-SVD.
  Dimensionality reduction has the adverse affect of amplifying the noise in a
highly nonlinear manner. Our results demonstrate the statistical advantage --
in both signal detection and estimation -- of the R-SVD over more naive
sketched PCA variants; the advantage is especially dramatic when the sketching
dimension is small. Our analysis is asymptotically exact, and substantially
more fine-grained than existing operator-norm error bounds for the R-SVD, which
largely fail to give meaningful error estimates in the moderate SNR regime. It
applies for a broad family of sketching matrices previously considered in the
literature, including Gaussian i.i.d. sketches, random projections, and the
sub-sampled Hadamard transform, among others.
  Lastly, we derive an optimal singular value shrinker for singular values and
vectors obtained through the R-SVD, which may be useful for applications in
matrix denoising.

To solve this problem, we propose InfoMin-Max for automated Graph contrastive

losing essential information. GIMM consists of two major modules: (1) automated
graph view generator, which acquires the approximation of InfoMin's optimal
views through adversarial training without requiring task-relevant information;
(2) view comparison, which learns an excellent encoder by applying InfoMax to
view representations. To the best of our knowledge, GIMM is the first method
that combines the InfoMin and InfoMax principles in GCL. Besides, GIMM
introduces randomness to augmentation, thus stabilizing the model against

self-organizing to a common group observer to estimate the missing information.

has two key designs:1) \textit{Cross-Guided Matching and Ensemble}.
\textit{CrossGET} incorporates cross-modal guided token matching and ensemble
to merge tokens effectively, only introducing cross-modal tokens with
negligible extra parameters. 2) \textit{Complete-Graph Soft Matching}. In
contrast to the previous bipartite soft matching approach, \textit{CrossGET}
introduces an efficient and effective complete-graph soft matching policy to
achieve more reliable token-matching results. Extensive experiments on various
vision-language tasks, datasets, and model architectures demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of the proposed \textit{CrossGET} framework. The

state-of-the-art accuracy for medical image segmentation, some major
limitations are still restricting their deployment into clinics. One major
limitation of deep learning-based segmentation methods is their lack of
robustness to variability in the image acquisition protocol and in the imaged
anatomy that were not represented or were underrepresented in the training
dataset. This suggests adding new manually segmented images to the training
dataset to better cover the image variability. However, in most cases, the
manual segmentation of medical images requires highly skilled raters and is
time-consuming, making this solution prohibitively expensive. Even when
manually segmented images from different sources are available, they are rarely
annotated for exactly the same regions of interest. This poses an additional
challenge for current state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation methods that
rely on supervised learning and therefore require all the regions of interest
to be segmented for all the images to be used for training. This thesis
introduces new mathematical and optimization methods to mitigate those
limitations.

induction task. Existing methods effectively address this task from a graph
generation perspective but suffer from noise-sensitive and error accumulation,
e.g., the inability to correct errors while generating schema. We, therefore,
propose a novel Diffusion Event Graph Model~(DEGM) to address these issues. Our
DEGM is the first workable diffusion model for event skeleton generation, where
the embedding and rounding techniques with a custom edge-based loss are
introduced to transform a discrete event graph into learnable latent
representation. Furthermore, we propose a denoising training process to
maintain the model's robustness. Consequently, DEGM derives the final schema,
where error correction is guaranteed by iteratively refining the latent
representation during the schema generation process. Experimental results on
three IED bombing datasets demonstrate that our DEGM achieves better results

systematically adjusting target peak power density and duty cycle. Adhering
(Ti,Al)N coatings with a critical residual tensile stress of 2.2 +/- 0.2 GPa

depositions at higher target peak power densities, realized by high power
pulsed magnetron sputtering, lead to stress-induced adhesive and/or cohesive

peak power density of 0.036 kW cm-2 and a duty cycle of 5.3% were investigated
by cross-cut test confirming adhesion. By investigating the bond formation at
the PC | (Ti,Al)N interface, mostly interfacial CNx bonds and a small fraction

indicating reactions at the hydrocarbon and the carbonate groups during

to verify initial matching results via repeated fitting of certain global
transformation among the images. However, incorrect matches may still exist.
Thus, a novel sampling scheme, Pentagon-Match (PMatch), is proposed in this
work to verify the correctness of initially matched keypoints using pentagons
randomly sampled from them. By ensuring shape and location of these pentagons
are view-invariant with various evaluations of cross-ratio (CR), incorrect
matches of keypoint can be identified easily with homography estimated from
correctly matched pentagons. Experimental results show that highly accurate

Besides, accurate outlier identification for the above matching results and

findings from our review are the following: there is robust empirical evidence
that larger and more developed countries are more likely to adopt the IT
regime; the introduction of this regime is conditional on previous
disinflation, greater exchange rate flexibility, central bank independence, and
higher level of financial development; the empirical evidence has failed to
provide convincing evidence that IT itself may serve as an effective tool for
stabilizing inflation expectations and for reducing inflation persistence; the
empirical research focused on advanced economies has failed to provide
convincing evidence on the beneficial effects of IT on inflation performance,
while there is some evidence that the gains from the IT regime may have been
more prevalent in the emerging market economies; there is not convincing
evidence that IT is associated with either higher output growth or lower output
variability; the empirical research suggests that IT may have differential
effects on exchange-rate volatility in advanced economies versus EMEs; although
the empirical evidence on the impact of IT on fiscal policy is quite limited,
it supports the idea that IT indeed improves fiscal discipline; the empirical
support to the proposition that IT is associated with lower disinflation costs
seems to be rather weak. Therefore, the accumulated empirical literature
implies that IT does not produce superior macroeconomic benefits in comparison
with the alternative monetary strategies or, at most, they are quite modest.

Zero-threshold lasers were realized previously only in single atom emitter
strongly coupled in a single mode cavity with spontaneous emission coupling
factor of unity. However, this was not feasible in microcavities hosting
isotropic Raman active materials with degenerate bare cavity modes. Here we
show that a zero threshold Raman laser can be achieved when Stoke shifted
polariton Raman modes are tuned within one of the anisotropic exciton-polariton
bands in an optical microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate that Raman active
anisotropic exciton-polaritons in a single mode microcavity offers a platform
to realize a PT-symmetric non-Hermitian quantum system of two nearly orthogonal
polariton modes that constitute a non-trivial band dispersion containing
exceptional points. We found that the PT-symmetric phase responsible for the
zero-threshold lasing can be switched to a finite threshold in PT-symmetry
broken phase via cavity detuning by the variation of bath temperature, as well
as by the variation of pump polarization and energy. Our discovery of zero

examples from a trained conditional generative model, boosts classification
performance in various learning tasks including (semi-)supervised learning,
few-shot learning, and adversarially robust learning. However, little work has
theoretically investigated the effect of generative data augmentation. To fill
this gap, we establish a general stability bound in this not independently and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) setting, where the learned distribution is
dependent on the original train set and generally not the same as the true
distribution. Our theoretical result includes the divergence between the
learned distribution and the true distribution. It shows that generative data
augmentation can enjoy a faster learning rate when the order of divergence term
is $o(\max\left( \log(m)\beta_m, 1 / \sqrt{m})\right)$, where $m$ is the train
set size and $\beta_m$ is the corresponding stability constant. We further
specify the learning setup to the Gaussian mixture model and generative
adversarial nets. We prove that in both cases, though generative data
augmentation does not enjoy a faster learning rate, it can improve the learning
guarantees at a constant level when the train set is small, which is
significant when the awful overfitting occurs. Simulation results on the
Gaussian mixture model and empirical results on generative adversarial nets
support our theoretical conclusions. Our code is available at

rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a reduced Rayleigh-number range
$1.3{\le}Ra/Ra_{c}{\le}166$. Under slow rotations ($Ra{\gtrsim}10Ra_{c}$), the
vortices are randomly distributed. The size-distribution of the Voronoi cells
of the vortex centers is well described by the standard $\Gamma$ distribution.
In this flow regime the vortices exhibit Brownian-type horizontal motion. The
probability density functions of the vortex displacements are, however,
non-Gaussian at short time scales. At modest rotating rates
($4Ra_{c}{\le}Ra{\lesssim}10Ra_{c}$) the centrifugal force leads to radial
vortex motions, i.e., warm cyclones (cold anticyclones) moving towards (outward
from) the rotation axis. The mean-square-displacements of the vortices increase
faster than linearly at large time. This super-diffusive behavior can be
satisfactorily explained by a Langevin model incorporating the centrifugal
force. In the rapidly rotating regime ($1.6Ra_{c}{\le}Ra{\le}4Ra_{c}$) the
vortices are densely distributed, with the size-distribution of their Voronoi
cells differing significantly from the standard $\Gamma$ distribution. The
hydrodynamic interaction of neighboring vortices results in formation of vortex
clusters. Inside clusters the correlation of the vortex velocity fluctuations
is scale free, with the correlation length being approximately $30\%$ of the
cluster length. We examine the influence of cluster forming on the dynamics of
individual vortex. Within clusters, cyclones exhibit inverse-centrifugal motion
as they submit to the motion of strong anticyclones, while the velocity for
outward motion of the anticyclones is increased. Our analysis show that the
mobility of isolated vortices, scaled by their vorticity strength, is a simple
power function of the Froude number.

information as additional constraints into the pretrained models (e.g.,
ControlNet). However, fine-tuning large-scale diffusion models on a single
image can lead to severe overfitting issues and lengthy inference time. The
information leakage from pretrained models makes it challenging to preserve the
text-irrelevant content of the input image while generating new features guided
by language descriptions. On the other hand, methods that incorporate
structural guidance (e.g., edge maps, semantic maps, keypoints) as additional
constraints face limitations in preserving other attributes of the original
image, such as colors or textures. A straightforward way to incorporate the
original image is to directly use it as an additional control. However, since
image editing methods are typically trained on the image reconstruction task,
the incorporation can lead to the identical mapping issue, where the model
learns to output an image identical to the input, resulting in limited editing

descent (SGD) through the lens of {\em dynamical stability} (Wu et al., 2018).
We start by revising existing stability analyses of SGD, showing how the
Frobenius norm and trace of Hessian relate to different notions of stability.
Notably, if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then the trace of
Hessian must be less than or equal to $2/\eta$, where $\eta$ denotes the
learning rate. By contrast, for gradient descent (GD), the stability imposes a
similar constraint but only on the largest eigenvalue of Hessian. We then turn
to analyze the generalization properties of these stable minima, focusing
specifically on two-layer ReLU networks and diagonal linear networks. Notably,
we establish the {\em equivalence} between these metrics of sharpness and
certain parameter norms for the two models, which allows us to show that the
stable minima of SGD provably generalize well. By contrast, the
stability-induced regularization of GD is provably too weak to ensure
satisfactory generalization. This discrepancy provides an explanation of why
SGD often generalizes better than GD. Note that the learning rate (LR) plays a
pivotal role in the strength of stability-induced regularization. As the LR
increases, the regularization effect becomes more pronounced, elucidating why
SGD with a larger LR consistently demonstrates superior generalization
capabilities. Additionally, numerical experiments are provided to support our
theoretical findings.

ART suffers from the problem of high computational costs during test case
generation, especially as the number of test cases increases. Although a number
of strategies have been proposed to enhance the ART testing efficiency, such as
the forgetting strategy and the k-dimensional tree strategy, these algorithms
still face some challenges, including: (1) Although these algorithms can reduce
the computation time, their execution costs are still very high, especially
when the number of test cases is large; and (2) To achieve low computational
costs, they may sacrifice some fault-detection capability. In this paper, we
propose an approach based on Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANNs), called
Locality Sensitive Hashing ART (LSH-ART). When calculating distances among
different test inputs, LSH-ART identifies the approximate (not necessarily
exact) nearest neighbors for candidates in an efficient way. LSH-ART attempts
to balance ART testing effectiveness and efficiency.

vision-language applications, including image caption evaluation and image
retrieval. However, existing scene graph parsers that convert image captions
into scene graphs often suffer from two types of errors. First, the generated
scene graphs fail to capture the true semantics of the captions or the
corresponding images, resulting in a lack of faithfulness. Second, the
generated scene graphs have high inconsistency, with the same semantics
represented by different annotations.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel dataset, which involves
re-annotating the captions in Visual Genome (VG) using a new intermediate
representation called FACTUAL-MR. FACTUAL-MR can be directly converted into
faithful and consistent scene graph annotations. Our experimental results
clearly demonstrate that the parser trained on our dataset outperforms existing
approaches in terms of faithfulness and consistency. This improvement leads to
a significant performance boost in both image caption evaluation and zero-shot
image retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric for measuring
scene graph similarity, which, when combined with the improved scene graph
parser, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple benchmark datasets
for the aforementioned tasks. The code and dataset are available at

quasiparticles. We numerically show that chiral motion of the density
distribution is observed and robust for the case with positive potentials
(quasiholes), but that there is no noticeable chiral motion for negative
potentials (quasiparticles). The comparison of the numerical ground states with
model lattice Laughlin wavefunctions suggests that both positive and negative
potentials do create and pin anyons that are not necessarily well-separated on
small lattices. Initializing the dynamics with the model state also shows the
lack of chiral dynamics of quasiparticles. Our results suggest that, in small
lattices with low particle density, quasiparticles are strongly adversely
affected in dynamical processes, whereas quasiholes are dynamically robust.

complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey
(DESI) and forecast how constraints on Omega_m-sigma_8 from this sample will
compare with those from number counts of clusters based on richness. At fixed
number density, we find that massive galaxies offer similar constraints to
galaxy clusters. However, a mass-complete galaxy sample from DESI has the
potential to probe lower halo masses than standard optical cluster samples
(which are typically limited to richness above 20 and halo mass above 10^13.5);
additionally, it is straightforward to cleanly measure projected galaxy
clustering for such a DESI sample, which we show can substantially improve the
constraining power on Omega_m. We also compare the constraining power of
stellar mass-limited samples to those from larger but mass-incomplete samples
(e.g., the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey, BGS, Sample); relative to a lower number
density stellar mass-limited samples, we find that a BGS-like sample improves
statistical constraints by 60% for Omega_m and 40% for sigma_8, but this uses
small scale information which will be harder to model for BGS. Our initial
assessment of the systematics associated with supermassive galaxy cosmology
yields promising results. The proposed samples have a 10% satellite fraction,
but we show that cosmological constraints may be robust to the impact of
satellites. These findings motivate future work to realize the potential of
super-massive galaxies to probe lower halo masses than richness-based clusters

puzzle about how to quantify the impact of different styles of imitation on the

imitation dynamics with incomplete social information, which unifies classical
imitation processes including death-birth and pairwise-comparison update rules.
In pairwise social dilemmas, we find that cooperation is most easily promoted
if individuals neglect personal information when imitating. If personal
information is considered, cooperators evolve more readily with more social
information. Intriguingly, when interactions take place in larger groups on
networks with low degrees of clustering, using more personal and less social

uncovering intuition behind these phenomena by examining the rate and range of

the Class Activation Map (CAM) is widely used to interpret deep model
predictions by highlighting object location, it fails to provide insight into
the salient features used by the model to make decisions. Furthermore, existing
evaluation protocols often overlook the correlation between interpretability
performance and the model's decision quality, which presents a more fundamental
issue. This paper proposes a new two-stage interpretability method called the
Decomposition Class Activation Map (Decom-CAM), which offers a feature-level
interpretation of the model's prediction. Decom-CAM decomposes intermediate
activation maps into orthogonal features using singular value decomposition and
generates saliency maps by integrating them. The orthogonality of features
enables CAM to capture local features and can be used to pinpoint semantic
components such as eyes, noses, and faces in the input image, making it more
beneficial for deep model interpretation. To ensure a comprehensive comparison,
we introduce a new evaluation protocol by dividing the dataset into subsets
based on classification accuracy results and evaluating the interpretability
performance on each subset separately. Our experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Decom-CAM outperforms current state-of-the-art methods significantly
by generating more precise saliency maps across all levels of classification
accuracy. Combined with our feature-level interpretability approach, this paper

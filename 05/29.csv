points subjected to constraints not only of a geometric type (holonomic
constraints) but also of a kinematic type (nonholonomic constraints). The
setting up of the equations of motion follows a simple principle which
generalizes the holonomic case. Furthermore, attention is paid to the fact that
the kinematic variables retain their velocity meaning, without resorting to the
pseudo-velocity technique. Particular situations are examined in which the
modeling of the constraints can be carried out in several ways to evaluate
their effective equivalence. Numerous examples, many of which taken from the
most recurring ones in the literature, are provided in order to illustrate the
proposed theory.

words of extended binary BCH codes of length $n=2^m$ and designed distance
$d(m,s,i):=2^{m-1-s}-2^{m-1-i-s}$ for some values of $m,i,s$, where $m$ may
grow to infinity. The support is specified as the sum of two sets: a set of
$2^{2i-1}-2^{i-1}$ elements, and a subspace of dimension $m-2i-s$, specified by
a basis.
  In some detail, for designed distance $6\cdot 2^j$, we have a deterministic
algorithm for even $m\geq 4$, and a probabilistic algorithm with success
probability $1-O(2^{-m})$ for odd $m>4$. For designed distance $28\cdot 2^j$,
we have a probabilistic algorithm with success probability $\geq
1/3-O(2^{-m/2})$ for even $m\geq 6$. Finally, for designed distance $120\cdot
2^j$, we have a deterministic algorithm for $m\geq 8$ divisible by $4$. We also
present a construction via Gold functions when $2i|m$.
  Our construction builds on results of Kasami and Lin (IEEE T-IT, 1972), who
proved that for extended binary BCH codes of designed distance $d(m,s,i)$, the
minimum distance equals the designed distance. Their proof makes use of a
non-constructive result of Berlekamp (Inform. Contrl., 1970), and a
constructive ``down-conversion theorem'' that converts some words in BCH codes
to lower-weight words in BCH codes of lower designed distance. Our main
contribution is in replacing the non-constructive argument of Berlekamp by a
low-complexity algorithm.
  In one aspect, we extends the results of Grigorescu and Kaufman (IEEE T-IT,
2012), who presented explicit minimum-weight words for designed distance $6$
(and hence also for designed distance $6\cdot 2^j$, by a well-known
``up-conversion theorem''), as we cover more cases of the minimum distance.
However, the minimum-weight words we construct are not affine generators for
designed distance $>6$.

it hard to recover details because the global feature is unlikely to capture
the full details of all missing parts. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to point cloud completion called Point-PC, which uses a memory network

transfer features of incomplete shapes into the domain of complete shape

obtained from cosmological simulations and analytical models to constrain our

M_{0}^{d}$). Haloes with small masses have already on average attained most of
their final masses. The average $<f_{0}>$ of haloes in the Universe is $ >
0.95$ pointing to the direction that the cosmic MAH/CSFRD is saturated at our
era. The average $<\beta_{h}>$ parameter (the depletion rate of the available
dark matter for halo growth) is related to the dynamical timescales of haloes.
The $\alpha$ parameter is a power-law index of $M_{0}$ and represents the early
growth a halo experiences before the expansion of the Universe starts to slow

to return a single summary, can improve ROUGE scores over the standard
single-step approach. Yet, standard decoding methods (i.e., beam search,
nucleus sampling, and diverse beam search) produce candidates with redundant,
and often low quality, content. In this paper, we design a novel method to
generate candidates for re-ranking that addresses these issues. We ground each
candidate abstract on its own unique content plan and generate distinct
plan-guided abstracts using a model's top beam. More concretely, a standard
language model (a BART LM) auto-regressively generates elemental discourse unit
(EDU) content plans with an extractive copy mechanism. The top K beams from the
content plan generator are then used to guide a separate LM, which produces a
single abstractive candidate for each distinct plan. We apply an existing
re-ranker (BRIO) to abstractive candidates generated from our method, as well
as baseline decoding methods. We show large relevance improvements over
previously published methods on widely used single document news article
corpora, with ROUGE-2 F1 gains of 0.88, 2.01, and 0.38 on CNN / Dailymail, NYT,

Similarly, on 1k samples from CNN / DM, we show that prompting GPT-3 to follow
EDU plans outperforms sampling-based methods by 1.05 ROUGE-2 F1 points. Code to
generate and realize plans is available at

test cases are usually complex and long in time. This is mainly because
realistic test scenarios are employed (e.g., for testing elevator dispatching
algorithms, typically a full day of passengers traveling through a system of
elevators is used). However, in such a context, when needing to reproduce a
failure, it is of high benefit to provide the minimal test input to the
software developers. This way, analyzing and trying to localize the root-cause
of the failure is easier and more agile. Delta debugging has been found to be
an efficient technique to reduce failure-inducing test inputs. In this paper,
we enhance this technique by first monitoring the environment at which the CPS
operates as well as its physical states. With the monitored information, we
search for stable states of the CPS during the execution of the simulation. In
a second step, we use such identified stable states to help the delta debugging
algorithm isolate the failure-inducing test inputs more efficiently.
  We report our experience of applying our approach into an industrial elevator
dispatching algorithm. An empirical evaluation carried out with real
operational data from a real installation of elevators suggests that the
proposed environment-wise delta debugging algorithm is between 1.3 to 1.8 times
faster than the traditional delta debugging, while producing a larger reduction
in the failure-inducing test inputs. The results provided by the different
implemented delta debugging algorithm versions are qualitatively assessed with
domain experts. This assessment provides new insights and lessons learned, such
as, potential applications of the delta debugging algorithm beyond debugging.

routinely undergo edge and vertex additions, as well as, deletions. Typical
examples of dynamic graphs are social networks, collaboration networks, and
road networks. Applying static algorithms repeatedly on dynamic graphs is
inefficient. Unfortunately, we know little about how to efficiently process
dynamic graphs on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs. Existing
approaches to represent and process dynamic graphs are either not general or
inefficient. In this work, we propose a library-based framework for dynamic
graph algorithms that proposes a GPU-tailored graph representation and exploits
the warp-cooperative execution model. The library, named Meerkat, builds upon a
recently proposed dynamic graph representation on GPUs. This representation
exploits a hashtable-based mechanism to store a vertex's neighborhood. Meerkat
also enables fast iteration through a group of vertices, such as the whole set
of vertices or the neighbors of a vertex. Based on the efficient iterative
patterns encoded in Meerkat, we implement dynamic versions of the popular graph

Existing backdoor
attacks against prompt-based models consider injecting backdoors into the
entire embedding layers or word embedding vectors. Such attacks can be easily
affected by retraining on downstream tasks and with different prompting
strategies, limiting the transferability of backdoor attacks. In this work, we
propose transferable backdoor attacks against prompt-based models, called
NOTABLE, which is independent of downstream tasks and prompting strategies.
Specifically, NOTABLE injects backdoors into the encoders of PLMs by utilizing
an adaptive verbalizer to bind triggers to specific words (i.e., anchors). It
activates the backdoor by pasting input with triggers to reach
adversary-desired anchors, achieving independence from downstream tasks and
prompting strategies. We conduct experiments on six NLP tasks, three popular
models, and three prompting strategies. Empirical results show that NOTABLE
achieves superior attack performance (i.e., attack success rate over 90% on all
the datasets), and outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines. Evaluations on
three defenses show the robustness of NOTABLE. Our code can be found at

estimation due to its ability to tractably represent belief over object pose.
However, the particle filter is prone to particle deprivation due to the
high-dimensional nature of 6D pose. When particle deprivation occurs, it can
cause mode collapse of the underlying belief distribution during importance
sampling. If the region surrounding the true state suffers from mode collapse,
recovering its belief is challenging since the area is no longer represented in
the probability mass formed by the particles. Previous methods mitigate this
problem by randomizing and resetting particles in the belief distribution, but
determining the frequency of reinvigoration has relied on hand-tuning abstract
heuristics. In this paper, we estimate the necessary reinvigoration rate at
each time step by introducing a Counter-Hypothetical likelihood function, which
is used alongside the standard likelihood. Inspired by the notions of
plausibility and implausibility from Evidential Reasoning, the addition of our
Counter-Hypothetical likelihood function assigns a level of doubt to each
particle. The competing cumulative values of confidence and doubt across the
particle set are used to estimate the level of failure within the filter, in
order to determine the portion of particles to be reinvigorated. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method on the rigid body object 6D pose tracking task.

partonic structure of bound nucleons differs from that of free nucleons. One
hypothesis is that this structure modification primarily occurs in highly

distinguishing this from other hypotheses is difficult with inclusive
measurements alone. Spectator-tagged deep inelastic scattering, on the other
hand, may offer a way to specifically probe the partonic structure of
highly-virtual nucleons by detecting the correlated emission of a spectator
nucleon. Here, we present a method for calculating a ``spectator-tagged''

description of short-range correlations with light-cone convolution formalism
to determine the impact of nucleon motion on the structure function. We apply
this method to calculate predictions for helium-4, and find that differences in
the virtuality-dependence of nucleon structure modification can lead to large
measurable changes in the tagged structure function. The recent CLAS12
Short-Range Correlations Experiment, which collected electron scattering data

Safety-oriented car-following models seek to specify a safe following distance

The discrete signals of CAVs bring a series of phenomena, including discrete

are rarely considered in the literature. This paper proposes an efficient

Method, of course, is the leading approach for attaining linear complexity in
the evaluation of long-range (e.g. Coulomb) many-body interactions. Low
complexity in translation operators for the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) is
usually achieved by algorithms specialized for a potential obeying a specific
partial differential equation (PDE). Absent a PDE or specialized algorithms,
Taylor series based FMMs or kernel-independent FMM have been used, at
asymptotically higher expense.
  When symbolically provided with a constant-coefficient elliptic PDE obeyed by
the potential, our algorithm can automatically synthesize translation operators
requiring $\mathrm{O}(p^d)$ operations, where $p$ is the expansion order and
$d$ is dimension, compared with $\mathrm{O}(p^{2d})$ operations in a naive
approach carried out on (Cartesian) Taylor expansions. This is achieved by
using a compression scheme that asymptotically reduces the number of terms in
the Taylor expansion and then operating directly on this ``compressed''
representation. Judicious exploitation of shared subexpressions permits
formation, translation, and evaluation of local and multipole expansions to be
performed in $\mathrm{O}(p^{d})$ operations, while an FFT-based scheme permits
multipole-to-local translations in $\mathrm{O}(p^{d-1}\log(p))$ operations. We
demonstrate computational scaling of code generation and evaluation as well as

systems to perform hardware and resource dependent data operation tasks. The
frequent use of interrupts in these systems can cause race conditions to occur
due to interactions between application tasks and interrupt handlers (or two
interrupt handlers). Numerous program analysis and testing techniques have been
proposed to detect races in multithreaded programs. Little work, however, has
addressed race condition problems related to hardware interrupts. In this
paper, we present SDRacer, an automated framework that can detect, validate and
repair race conditions in interrupt-driven embedded software. It uses a
combination of static analysis and symbolic execution to generate input data
for exercising the potential races. It then employs virtual platforms to
dynamically validate these races by forcing the interrupts to occur at the
potential racing points. Finally, it provides repair candidates to eliminate
the detected races. We evaluate SDRacer on nine real-world embedded programs
written in C language. The results show that SDRacer can precisely detect and
successfully fix race conditions.

  **Purpose:** We conducted a study to introduce a model, utilizing
human-guided knowledge and unique modules, to address the challenges of 3D
tumor segmentation.
  **Methods:** We developed the PropNet framework, propagating radiologists'
knowledge from 2D annotations to the entire 3D space. This model consists of a
proposing stage for coarse segmentation and a refining stage for improved
segmentation, using two-way branches for enhanced performance and an up-down
strategy for efficiency.
  **Results:** With 98 patient scans for training and 30 for validation, our
method achieves a significant agreement with manual annotation (Dice of 0.803)
and improves efficiency. The performance is comparable in different scenarios
and with various radiologists' annotations (Dice between 0.785 and 0.803).
Moreover, the model shows improved prognostic prediction performance (C-index

advanced gastric cancer.
  **Conclusions:** Our model generates accurate tumor segmentation efficiently

which is granular matter. In a granular assembly, vibration can be treated as
the information-bearing mode. This can be exploited to realize ""polycomputing"":
materials can be evolved such that a single grain within them can report the
result of multiple logical operations simultaneously at different frequencies,
without recourse to quantum effects. Here, we demonstrate the evolution of a
material in which one grain acts simultaneously as two different NAND gates at
two different frequencies. NAND gates are of interest as any logical operations

electronic properties that made it useful in various applications, including
solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and biofluorescent tagging. In order to
synthesize high-quality crystals and subsequently integrate them into devices,
it is crucial to understand the atomic scale crystallization mechanism of CdSe.
Unfortunately, such studies are still absent in the literature.To overcome this
limitation, we employed an enhanced sampling-accelerated active learning
approach to construct a deep neural potential with ab initio accuracy for
studying the crystallization of CdSe.Our brute-force molecular dynamics
simulations revealed that a spherical-like nucleus formed spontaneously and
stochastically, resulting in a stacking disordered structure where the
competition between hexagonal wurtzite and cubic zinc blende polymorphs is
temperature-dependent. We found that pure hexagonal crystal can only be
obtained approximately above 1430 K, which is 35 K below its melting
temperature. We observed that the solidification dynamics of Cd and Se atoms
were distinct due to their different diffusion coefficients. The solidification
process was initiated by lower mobile Se atoms forming tetrahedral frameworks,
followed by Cd atoms occupying these tetrahedral centers and settling down
until the third-shell neighbor of Se atoms sited on their lattice positions.
Therefore, the medium-range ordering of Se atoms governs the crystallization
process of CdSe. Our findings indicate that understanding the complex dynamical
process is the key to comprehending the crystallization mechanism of compounds
like CdSe, and can shed lights in the synthesis of high-quality crystals.

previously unexplored plasma regime near the Sun. They may be capable of
producing important effects on the solar wind. Because this wave mode has not
been observed or studied previously and it is not fully understood, the issue
of whether it has a natural origin or is an instrumental artifact can be
raised. This paper discusses this issue by examining 13 features of the data
such as whether the triggered ion-acoustic waves are electrostatic, whether
they are both narrow-band, whether they satisfy the requirement that the
electric field is parallel to the k-vector, whether the phase difference
between the electric field and the density fluctuations is 90 degrees, whether
the two waves have the same phase velocity as they must if they are coupled,
whether the phase velocity is that of an ion-acoustic wave, whether they are
associated with other parameters such as electron heating, whether the electric
field instrument otherwise performed as expected, etc. The conclusion reached
from these analyses is that triggered ion-acoustic waves are highly likely to
have a natural origin although the possibility that they are artifacts
unrelated to processes occurring in the natural plasma cannot be eliminated.
This inability to absolutely rule out artifacts as the source of a measured
result is a characteristic of all measurements.

because small size implies the higher topological charge density, stronger

integration for topological quantum devices5-9. However, finding ultra-small
topological spin textures at high temperatures is still a great challenge up to
now. Here we find ultra-small topological spin textures in Fe78Si9B13 amorphous

temperature, indicating the existence of highly densed and ultra-small
topological spin textures in the samples. Further measurements by small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) reveal that the average size of ultra-small magnetic
texture is around 1.3nm. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that such ultra-small
spin texture is topologically equivalent to skyrmions, which originate from
competing frustration and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction12,13 coming from
amorphous structure14-17. Taking a single topological spin texture as one bit
and ignoring the distance between them, we evaluated the ideal memory density
of Fe78Si9B13, which reaches up to 4.44*104 gigabits (43.4 TB) per in2 and is 2
times of the value of GdRu2Si218 at 5K. More important, such high memory

For \emph{any} $\beta\in(0,1)$, we show that $L_t^1C_x^{0,\beta}$ solutions

novelty stems from obtaining new bounds on the fundamental solution associated
with a one-dimensional drift-diffusion equation in the presence of
destabilizing singular lower order terms. Such a bound relies heavily on the
symmetry and pointwise structure of the problem, where the drift term is shown
to ``enhance'' the parabolic nature of the equation, allowing us to break the

emitters in the two-dimensional material hexagonal boron nitride. These
emitters are of great interest, yet many of them are still to be identified.
Our results suggest that instead of comparing a single optical property, such
as the commonly used zero-phonon line energy, multiple properties should be
used when comparing theoretical simulations to the experiment. This way, the
entire electronic structure can be predicted and quantum emitters can be
designed and tailored. Moreover, we apply this approach to predict the
suitability for using the emitters in specific quantum applications,
demonstrating through the examples of the Al$_{\text{N}}$ and
P$_{\text{N}}$V$_{\text{B}}$ defects. We therefore combine and apply DFT
calculations to identify quantum emitters in solid-state crystals with a lower
risk of misassignments as well as a way to design and tailor optical quantum
systems. This consequently serves as a recipe for classification and the
generation of universal solid-state quantum emitter systems in future hybrid
quantum networks.

  the Memory of Jackson Rae Herring",,,,"physics.flu-dyn astro-ph.SR physics.ao-ph physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Non-equilibrium property of turbulence modifies characteristics of turbulent
transport. With the aid of response-function formalism, such non-equilibrium
effects in turbulent transport can be represented by the temporal variation of
the turbulent energy ($K$) and its dissipation rate ($\varepsilon$) along the
mean stream through the advective derivatives of $K$ and $\varepsilon$.
Applications of this effect to the turbulent convection with plumes are
considered for the first time in this work. The non-equilibrium transport
effects associated with plumes are addressed in two aspects. Firstly, the
effect associated with a single plume is evaluated using data measured in the
recent plume/jet experiments. The second argument is developed for the
collective turbulent transport associated with multiple plumes mimicking the
stellar convection zone. In this second case, for the purpose of capturing the
plume motions into the advective derivatives, use has to be made of the
time--space double averaging procedure, where the turbulent fluctuations are
divided into the coherent or dispersion component (which represents plume
motions) and incoherent or random component. With the aid of the transport
equations of the coherent velocity stress and the incoherent counterpart, the
interaction between the dispersion and random fluctuations are also discussed
in the context of convective turbulent flows with plumes. It is shown from
these analyses that the non-equilibrium effect associated with plume motions is
of a great deal of relevance in the convective turbulence modelling.

learning for pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, denoted as FSWC.
A solution is proposed based on prompt learning and the utilization of a large
language model, GPT-4. Since a WSI is too large and needs to be divided into
patches for processing, WSI classification is commonly approached as a Multiple
Instance Learning (MIL) problem. In this context, each WSI is considered a bag,
and the obtained patches are treated as instances. The objective of FSWC is to
classify both bags and instances with only a limited number of labeled bags.
Unlike conventional few-shot learning problems, FSWC poses additional
challenges due to its weak bag labels within the MIL framework. Drawing
inspiration from the recent achievements of vision-language models (V-L models)
in downstream few-shot classification tasks, we propose a two-level prompt
learning MIL framework tailored for pathology, incorporating language prior
knowledge. Specifically, we leverage CLIP to extract instance features for each
patch, and introduce a prompt-guided pooling strategy to aggregate these
instance features into a bag feature. Subsequently, we employ a small number of
labeled bags to facilitate few-shot prompt learning based on the bag features.
Our approach incorporates the utilization of GPT-4 in a question-and-answer
mode to obtain language prior knowledge at both the instance and bag levels,
which are then integrated into the instance and bag level language prompts.
Additionally, a learnable component of the language prompts is trained using
the available few-shot labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments on three
real WSI datasets encompassing breast cancer, lung cancer, and cervical cancer,
demonstrating the notable performance of the proposed method in bag and
instance classification. All codes will be made publicly accessible.

sharing and merging of sensing data from different roadside sensors for object
detection, has shown promise in preventing occlusions for traffic safety and
efficiency. However, its adoption has been hindered by the lack of guidance for
roadside sensor placement and high costs for ex-post evaluation. For
infrastructure projects with limited budgets, the ex-ante evaluation for
optimizing the configurations and placements of infrastructure sensors is
crucial to minimize occlusion risks at a low cost.
  This paper presents algorithms and simulation tools to support the ex-ante
evaluation of the cost-performance tradeoff in infrastructure sensor deployment
for collective perception. More specifically, the deployment of infrastructure
sensors is framed as an integer programming problem that can be efficiently
solved in polynomial time, achieving near-optimal results with the use of
certain heuristic algorithms. The solutions provide guidance on deciding sensor
locations, installation heights, and configurations to achieve the balance
between procurement cost, physical constraints for installation, and sensing
coverage. Additionally, we implement the proposed algorithms in a simulation
engine. This allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of each sensor deployment
solution through the lens of object detection. The application of the proposed
methods was illustrated through a case study on traffic monitoring by using
infrastructure LiDARs. Preliminary findings indicate that when working with a
tight sensing budget, it is possible that the incremental benefit derived from
integrating additional low-resolution LiDARs could surpass that of
incorporating more high-resolution ones. The results reinforce the necessity of
investigating the cost-performance tradeoff.

recognition (FER) task, the label noise is widely existing in the FER dataset.
For this problem, in the training phase, current FER methods often directly
predict whether the label of the input image is noised or not, aiming to reduce
the contribution of the noised data in training. However, we argue that this
kind of method suffers from the low reliability of such noise data decision
operation. It makes that some mistakenly abounded clean data are not utilized
sufficiently and some mistakenly kept noised data disturbing the model learning
process. In this paper, we propose a more reliable noise-label suppression
method called ReSup (Reliable label noise Suppression for FER). First, instead
of directly predicting noised or not, ReSup makes the noise data decision by
modeling the distribution of noise and clean labels simultaneously according to
the disagreement between the prediction and the target. Specifically, to
achieve optimal distribution modeling, ReSup models the similarity distribution
of all samples. To further enhance the reliability of our noise decision
results, ReSup uses two networks to jointly achieve noise suppression.
Specifically, ReSup utilize the property that two networks are less likely to
make the same mistakes, making two networks swap decisions and tending to trust
decisions with high agreement. Extensive experiments on three popular
benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art noisy label FER methods by 3.01% on FERPlus becnmarks. Code:

multiple tasks. DL libraries are essential for building DL applications.
Furthermore, DL operators are the important building blocks of the DL
libraries, that compute the multi-dimensional data (tensors). Therefore, bugs
in DL operators can have great impacts. Testing is a practical approach for
detecting bugs in DL operators. In order to test DL operators effectively, it
is essential that the test cases pass the input validity check and are able to
reach the core function logic of the operators. Hence, extracting the input
validation constraints is required for generating high-quality test cases.
Existing techniques rely on either human effort or documentation of DL library
APIs to extract the constraints. They cannot extract complex constraints and
the extracted constraints may differ from the actual code implementation.
  To address the challenge, we propose ACETest, a technique to automatically
extract input validation constraints from the code to build valid yet diverse
test cases which can effectively unveil bugs in the core function logic of DL
operators. For this purpose, ACETest can automatically identify the input
validation code in DL operators, extract the related constraints and generate
test cases according to the constraints. The experimental results on popular DL
libraries, TensorFlow and PyTorch, demonstrate that ACETest can extract
constraints with higher quality than state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques.
Moreover, ACETest is capable of extracting 96.4% more constraints and detecting
1.95 to 55 times more bugs than SOTA techniques. In total, we have used ACETest
to detect 108 previously unknown bugs on TensorFlow and PyTorch, with 87 of
them confirmed by the developers. Lastly, five of the bugs were assigned with
CVE IDs due to their security impacts.

control design and implementation of ramp metering algorithms. One major
challenge of the estimation problem is that the CV data only represent partial

penetration rates are unknown. To address this, we build our estimation
approach on both traditional freeway sensors and new CV data. We first
formulate a ramp queue model that considers i) variations in the penetration
rate and ii) noise in measurements. Then we develop a robust filter that
minimizes the impacts of these two kinds of uncertainties on queue estimation.
More importantly, we show that the designed filter has guaranteed long-term

with a completely random sample pattern, but also from opportunistic sampling
(e.g., whale or bird watching fishery commercial vessels), in which observers
tend to look for a specific species in areas where they expect to find it.
  Species Distribution Models (SDMs) are a widely used tool for analyzing this
kind of ecological data. Specifically, we have two models available for the
above data: an independent model (IM) for the data coming from a complete
random sampler and a dependent model (DM) for data from opportunistic sampling.
  In this work, we propose a sequential Bayesian procedure to connect these two
models through the update of prior distributions. Implementation of the
Bayesian paradigm is done through the integrated nested Laplace approximation
(INLA) methodology, a good option to make inference and prediction in spatial
models with high performance and low computational costs. This sequential
approach has been evaluated by simulating several scenarios and comparing the
results of sharing information from one model to another using different
criteria.
  Our main results imply that, in general, it is better to share information
from the independent (completely random) to the dependent model than the
alternative way. However, it depends on different factors such as the spatial

Our approach considers both the diffuse and specular colors, which allows for
handling complex view-dependent lighting effects for surface reconstruction.
Second, we distill light visibility and indirect illumination from the learned
SDF and radiance field using learnable mapping functions. Third, we design a
method for estimating the ratio of incoming direct light represented via
Spherical Gaussians reflected in a specular manner and then reconstruct the
materials and direct illumination of the scene. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
in recovering surfaces, materials, and lighting without relying on any
additional data.

construction sites. Monitoring workers' proximities to avoid human-machine

Existing methods are either too laborious and costly to apply extensively, or
lacking spatial perception for accurate monitoring. Therefore, this study
proposes a novel framework for proximity monitoring using only an ordinary 2D
camera to realize real-time human-machine collision warning, which is designed
to integrate a monocular 3D object detection model to perceive spatial
information from 2D images and a post-processing classification module to
identify the proximity as four predefined categories: Dangerous, Potentially
Dangerous, Concerned, and Safe. A virtual dataset containing 22000 images with
3D annotations is constructed and publicly released to facilitate the system
development and evaluation. Experimental results show that the trained 3D
object detection model achieves 75% loose AP within 20 meters. Besides, the
implemented system is real-time and camera carrier-independent, achieving an F1
of roughly 0.8 within 50 meters under specified settings for machines of
different sizes. This study preliminarily reveals the potential and feasibility
of proximity monitoring using only a 2D camera, providing a new promising and
economical way for early warning of human-machine collisions.

such confined geometries, as well as the sensitivity of the emergent patterns
to driving forces that couple to cell motion. In the absence of vacancies, akin
to dense cell packing, the translation dynamics is arrested and the model
reduces to an equilibrium spin model which can be solved exactly. In the
presence of vacancies, the interplay of activity-driven translation, cell
polarity switching, and CIL results in an exponential steady cluster size
distribution. We define a dimensionless P\'eclet number Q - the ratio of the
translation rate and directional switching rate of particles in the absence of
CIL. While the average cluster size increases monotonically as a function of Q,
it exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on CIL strength, when the Q is
sufficiently high. In the high Q limit, an analytical form of average cluster
size can be obtained approximately by effectively mapping the system to an
equivalent equilibrium process involving clusters of different sizes wherein
the cluster size distribution is obtained by minimizing an effective Helmholtz
free energy for the system. The resultant prediction of exponential dependence
on CIL strength of the average cluster size and Q^{1/2} dependence of the
average cluster size is borne out to reasonable accuracy as long as the CIL

computation layers to form the CNN to better maintain the phase information of
CSI. Furthermore, we incorporate the ISAC transform modules into the CNN
enhancer to transform the CSI into the sparse angle-delay domain, which can be
treated as images with prominent peaks and are suitable to be processed by CNN.
Then, we further propose a novel biased FFT-based sensing scheme, where we
actively add known phase bias terms to the original CSI to generate multiple
estimation results using a simple FFT-based sensing method, and we finally
calculate the average of all the debiased sensing results to obtain more
accurate range estimates. The extensive simulation results show that the ISAC

estimation normalized mean square error (NMSE) is about 17 dB lower than the
MMSE method, and the bit error rate (BER) of demodulation using the enhanced

trained molecules. This paper attempts to develop a new QSAR method that is
theoretically possible to predict various properties of molecules with diverse
structures. The proposed deep electron cloud-activity relationships (DECAR) and
deep field-activity relationships (DFAR) methods consist of three essentials:
(1) A large number of molecule entities with activity data as training objects
and responses; (2) three-dimensional electron cloud density (ECD) or related
field data by the accurate density functional theory methods as input
descriptors; (3) a deep learning model that is sufficiently flexible and
powerful to learn the large data described above. DECAR and DFAR are used to
distinguish 977 sweet and 1965 non-sweet molecules (with 6-fold data
augmentation) and the classification performance is demonstrated to be
significantly better than the traditional least squares support vector machine
(LS-SVM) models using traditional descriptors. DECAR and DFAR would provide a
possible way to establish a widely applicable, cumulative, and shareable
artificial intelligence-driven QSAR system. They are likely to promote the
development of an interactive platform to collect and share the accurate ECD

find faint JWST galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}>{\sim}-19.5$) to remain consistent with

significantly from their lower-redshift counterparts. We also find that these

Type W, where the W-shaped feature is present, and Type 15bn, where it is

SLSNe-I tend to be hotter compared to Type 15bn objects, and they are different

concluded that in terms of photospheric temperature and velocity, Type W and
Type 15bn SLSNe decrease to a similar value by the post-maximum phases, and
their pseudo-nebular spectra are nearly uniform. Pseudo-equivalent width
calculations show that the pEW of the wavelength range between 4166 and 5266

the bimodality of Type W and Type 15bn SLSNe-I therefore is in their

Robotics and Automation such as autonomous driving. While learning-based
trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable performance on public
benchmarks, the generalization ability of these approaches remains
questionable. The poor generalizability on unseen domains, a well-recognized
defect of data-driven approaches, can potentially harm the real-world
performance of trajectory prediction models. We are thus motivated to improve
generalization ability of models instead of merely pursuing high accuracy on
average. Due to the lack of benchmarks for quantifying the generalization
ability of trajectory predictors, we first construct a new benchmark called
argoverse-shift, where the data distributions of domains are significantly
different. Using this benchmark for evaluation, we identify that the domain
shift problem seriously hinders the generalization of trajectory predictors
since state-of-the-art approaches suffer from severe performance degradation
when facing those out-of-distribution scenes. To enhance the robustness of
models against domain shift problem, we propose a plug-and-play strategy for
domain normalization in trajectory prediction. Our strategy utilizes the Frenet
coordinate frame for modeling and can effectively narrow the domain gap of
different scenes caused by the variety of road geometry and topology.
Experiments show that our strategy noticeably boosts the prediction performance
of the state-of-the-art in domains that were previously unseen to the models,
thereby improving the generalization ability of data-driven trajectory
prediction methods.

metal content of foreground galaxies (observed at $R$ = 4000 - 7000), as traced
by metal absorption. Such large surveys require specialized analysis
methodologies. In the absence of early data, we instead produce synthetic 4MOST
high-resolution fibre quasar spectra. To do so, we use the TNG50 cosmological
magnetohydrodynamical simulation, combining photo-ionization post-processing
and ray tracing, to capture MgII ($\lambda2796$, $\lambda2803$) absorbers. We
then use this sample to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which
searches for, and estimates the redshift of, MgII absorbers within these
spectra. For a test sample of quasar spectra with uniformly distributed
properties ($\lambda_{\rm{MgII,2796}}$, $\rm{EW}_{\rm{MgII,2796}}^{\rm{rest}} =
0.05 - 5.15$ \AA, $\rm{SNR} = 3 - 50$), the algorithm has a robust
classification accuracy of 98.6 per cent and a mean wavelength accuracy of 6.9
\AA. For high signal-to-noise spectra ($\rm{SNR > 20}$), the algorithm robustly
detects and localizes MgII absorbers down to equivalent widths of
$\rm{EW}_{\rm{MgII,2796}}^{\rm{rest}} = 0.05$ \AA. For the lowest SNR spectra
($\rm{SNR=3}$), the CNN reliably recovers and localizes
EW$_{\rm{MgII,2796}}^{\rm{rest}}$ $\geq$ 0.75 \AA\, absorbers. This is more
than sufficient for subsequent Voigt profile fitting to characterize the
detected MgII absorbers. We make the code publicly available through GitHub.

we proposed three metrics (Hatefulness, Relativeness, and Offensiveness) to
measure the severity of HTs. These metrics assist to create an Inter-agreement
HTs-list, which explains the contribution of an individual hate term toward
hate speech classification. Then, we used the Offensiveness metric values of
HTs above a proposed threshold minimum Offense (minOffense) to generate a new
Severe HTs-list. To evaluate our approach, we used three hate speech datasets

(SHR) mining to provide ordered co-occurrence of various HTs with minimum
Stability (minStab). The SHR mining detects frequently co-occurring HTs to form
Stable Hate Rules and Concepts. These rules and concepts are used to visualise
the graphs of Transitivities and Lattices formed by HTs.

density wave (PDW), an exotic superconducting phase with non-zero momentum
Cooper pairs, has been observed in high-Tc cuprates and the monolayer FeSC.
However, the interplay between the CDW, PDW and nematic phase remains to be

commensurate CDW and CDW-induced PDW orders with the same period of lambda =

orders. Our works provide a new platform to study the intertwined orders and
their interactions in high-Tc superconductors.

nearly inexhaustible energy. While notable progress has been made in recent
years, significant challenges persist in achieving net energy gain. Improving
plasma confinement and stability stands as a crucial task in this regard and
requires optimization and control of the plasma system. In this work, we deploy
a PDE-constrained optimization formulation that uses a kinetic description for
plasma dynamics as the constraint. This is to optimize, over all possible
controllable external electric fields, the stability of the plasma dynamics
under the condition that the Vlasov--Poisson (VP) equation is satisfied. For
computing the functional derivative with respect to the external field in the
optimization updates, the adjoint equation is derived. Furthermore, in the
discrete setting, where we employ the semi-Lagrangian method as the forward
solver, we also explicitly formulate the corresponding adjoint solver and the
gradient as the discrete analogy to the adjoint equation and the Frechet
derivative. A distinct feature we observed of this constrained optimization is
the complex landscape of the objective function and the existence of numerous
local minima, largely due to the hyperbolic nature of the VP system. To
overcome this issue, we utilize a gradient-accelerated genetic algorithm,
leveraging the advantages of the genetic algorithm's exploration feature to
cover a broader search of the solution space and the fast local convergence
aided by the gradient information. We show that our algorithm obtains good
electric fields that are able to maintain a prescribed profile in a beam

they need to carefully handcraft a compression rate (i.e. number of tokens to
remove), which is tedious and leads to sub-optimal performance. To tackle this
problem, we propose Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate), a novel token
compression method that has several appealing properties prior arts do not
have. First, DiffRate enables propagating the loss function's gradient onto the
compression ratio, which is considered as a non-differentiable hyperparameter
in previous work. In this case, different layers can automatically learn
different compression rates layer-wisely without extra overhead. Second, token
pruning and merging can be naturally performed simultaneously in DiffRate,
while they were isolated in previous works. Third, extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffRate achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example,
by applying the learned layer-wise compression rates to an off-the-shelf ViT-H
(MAE) model, we achieve a 40% FLOPs reduction and a 1.5x throughput
improvement, with a minor accuracy drop of 0.16% on ImageNet without

nitride structures are mechanically and dynamically stable. Moreover, the
calculated elastic moduli demonstrate that all the niobium nitrides are hard
materials with bulk moduli and hardness being comparable to or larger than the
well-known hard sapphire. Third, the calculated band structures reveal that the
nitrides possess both type I and type II Dirac nodal points and are thus
topological metals. Finally, the calculated electron-phonon coupling strength,
superconductivity and mechanical property of the niobium nitrides are discussed

Precisely, we prove that, for systems in a steady state with arbitrary

time, with the growth speed determined by the rates of entropy production and
dynamical activity. In the long-time regime, the asymmetry exhibits exponential
decay, with the decay rate dictated by the spectral gap of the transition

factor in certain scenarios. Event cameras (DVS -- Dynamic Vision Sensor) are a
potentially interesting technology to address the above mentioned problems. In
this paper, we compare two methods of processing event data by means of deep

Despite existing methods achieving impressive results in this task, there is
still room for improvement in generating high-quality stylized faces with
diverse styles and accurate facial reconstruction. Our proposed framework,
MMFS, supports multi-modal face stylization by leveraging the strengths of
StyleGAN and integrates it into an encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically,
we use the mid-resolution and high-resolution layers of StyleGAN as the decoder
to generate high-quality faces, while aligning its low-resolution layer with
the encoder to extract and preserve input facial details. We also introduce a
two-stage training strategy, where we train the encoder in the first stage to
align the feature maps with StyleGAN and enable a faithful reconstruction of
input faces. In the second stage, the entire network is fine-tuned with
artistic data for stylized face generation. To enable the fine-tuned model to
be applied in zero-shot and one-shot stylization tasks, we train an additional
mapping network from the large-scale Contrastive-Language-Image-Pre-training
(CLIP) space to a latent $w+$ space of fine-tuned StyleGAN. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments show that our framework achieves superior face
stylization performance in both one-shot and zero-shot stylization tasks,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

shifts between the training and test data. To address this problem, prevailing
fully test-time adaptation~(TTA) methods bootstrap themselves through entropy
minimization. However, minimizing the entropy of the predictions makes the
model overfit to incorrect output distributions of itself. In this work, we
propose TTA with feedback to avoid such overfitting and align the model with
task goals. Specifically, we adopt CLIP as reward model to provide feedback for
VL models during test time in various tasks, including image classification,
image-text retrieval, and image captioning. Given a single test sample, the
model aims to maximize CLIP reward through reinforcement learning. We adopt a
reward design with the average CLIP score of sampled candidates as the
baseline. This design is simple and surprisingly effective when combined with
various task-specific sampling strategies. The entire system is flexible,
allowing the reward model to be extended with multiple CLIP models. Plus, a
momentum buffer can be used to memorize and leverage the learned knowledge from
multiple test samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves different VL models after TTA.

should be if gravitational collapse alone were at play. It has recently been
shown that one candidate that might regulate star formation, the feedback from
massive stars, is suitable only if the mean column density at the kiloparsec
scale is lower than $\approx 20 M_\odot\cdot\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$. On the other
hand, intense large-scale turbulent driving might slow down star formation in
high-density environments to values that are compatible with observations. In
this work, we explore the effect of the nature and strength of the turbulent
driving, as well as the effect of the magnetic field. We performed a large
series of feedback-regulated numerical simulations of the interstellar medium
in which bidimensional large-scale turbulent driving was also applied. We
determined the driving intensity needed to reproduce the Schmidt-Kennicutt
relation for several gas column densities, magnetization, and driving
compressibility. We confirm that in the absence of turbulent forcing and even
with a substantial magnetic field, the SFR is too high, particularly at a high
column density, compared to the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. We find that the
SFR outcome strongly depends on the initial magnetic field and on the
compressibility of the turbulent driving. As a consequence, a higher magnetic
field in high column density environment may lower the energy necessary to
sustain a turbulence that is sufficiently intense to regulate star formation.
Stellar feedback does not seem to be sufficient to regulate star formation in
gas-rich galaxies where large-scale turbulent driving may be needed. The
sources of this large-scale turbulence as well as its characteristics, such as
its intensity, compressibility, and anisotropy, need to be understood and
quantified.

we study data transformations based on graph neural networks (GNNs). First, we
note that the choice of how a dataset is encoded into a numeric form
processable by a GNN can obscure the characterisation of a model's
expressivity, and we argue that a canonical encoding provides an appropriate
basis. Second, we study the expressivity of monotonic max-sum GNNs, which cover
a subclass of GNNs with max and sum aggregation functions. We show that, for
each such GNN, one can compute a Datalog program such that applying the GNN to
any dataset produces the same facts as a single round of application of the

number of feature vectors which can result in arbitrarily large feature values,
whereas rule application requires only a bounded number of constants. Hence,
our result shows that the unbounded summation of monotonic max-sum GNNs does
not increase their expressive power. Third, we sharpen our result to the
subclass of monotonic max GNNs, which use only the max aggregation function,

operator $H$ is from the Schatten-von Neumann class. In this paper, we consider
the compact operators $A$ representable as a sum of two compact operators
$A=C+T$, i.e., $A$ is not necessarily a weak perturbation, where $C$ is a
non-negative operator. We will prove existence theorems of nonzero eigenvalues
for such operators. The study of the spectral properties of operators generated

boundary-value problems that are well posed. But Hadamard's example shows that
the Cauchy problem for the Laplace equation is ill posed. At present, not a

Volterra well-defined restriction of a maximal operator $\widehat{L}$ or a
Volterra well-defined extension of a minimal operator $L_0$ generated by the
Laplace operator? The obtained existence theorems for eigenvalues give that a
wide class of well-defined restrictions of the maximal operator $\widehat{L}$

adding multiple adapters within a backbone-model layer to learn the unique
characteristics of different speakers. Our approach outperforms the baseline,
with a noticeable improvement of 5% observed in speaker preference tests when
using only one minute of data for each new speaker. Moreover, following the
adapter paradigm, we fine-tune only the adapter parameters (11% of the total
model parameters). This is a significant achievement in parameter-efficient
speaker adaptation, and one of the first models of its kind. Overall, our
proposed approach offers a promising solution to the speech synthesis
techniques, particularly for adapting to speakers from diverse backgrounds.

the validity of the energy conditions. Specifically, we argue that a hidden
assumption in the theorem, namely the vanishing of the quantity $\mathcal{G} =
\mathcal{E} + T^\theta\!_\theta$, where $\mathcal{E}$ is the energy density and
$T^\theta\!_\theta$ the corresponding component of the energy-momentum tensor
of the scalar field theory, can be relaxed. Indeed, if $\mathcal{G}$ is
positive, as a consequence of the assumption on the validity of the energy
conditions, then scalar hair is potentially allowed in the black hole's
exterior, consistently with the gravitational equations and the generic
properties of the (non-trivial) energy momentum tensor. As an explicit example,
in which such a behaviour is realised, we discuss the well known model of a
(3+1)-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole coupled to a spontaneously broken
Yang-Mills $SU (2)$ gauge theory interacting with a Higgs scalar. We present a
rather novel approach to obtain analytical black hole solutions for this system
(in contrast to the numerical ones in the existing literature) by applying an
appropriate perturbative treatment whereby the black hole configuration is
derived as a result of backreaction of Higgs and gauge fields onto an initially
fixed flat spacetime. The massive nature of the scalar and gauge fields in this
example requires a special treatment, because of their asymptotic form, which
we discuss in some detail.

Shaping) is used in time-sensitive networks for reshaping the flows with
per-flow contracts. When applied to an aggregate of flows that come from a FIFO
system, an interleaved regulator that reshapes the flows with their initial
contracts does not increase the worst-case delay of the aggregate. This
shaping-for-free property supports the computation of end-to-end latency bounds
and the validation of the network's timing requirements. A common method to
establish the properties of a network element is to obtain a network-calculus
service-curve model. The existence of such a model for the interleaved
regulator remains an open question. If a service-curve model were found for the
interleaved regulator, then the analysis of this mechanism would no longer be
limited to the situations where the shaping-for-free holds, which would widen
its use in time-sensitive networks. In this paper, we investigate if
network-calculus service curves can capture the behavior of the interleaved
regulator. We find that an interleaved regulator placed outside of the
shaping-for-free requirements (after a non-FIFO system) can yield unbounded
latencies. Consequently, we prove that no network-calculus service curve exists
to explain the interleaved regulator's behavior. It is still possible to find
non-trivial service curves for the interleaved regulator. However, their
long-term rate cannot be large enough to provide any guarantee (specifically,
we prove that for the regulators that process at least four flows with the same
contract, the long-term rate of any service curve is upper bounded by three
times the rate of the per-flow contract).

demonstrated using the well-studied binary neutron star signal GW170817. As a

the DSD incorporates prior physical knowledge, which enables the prediction of
sharply peaked and heavy-tailed distributions. Fourth, we compare our method
with a benchmark approach, which estimates the DSD by interpolating the
frequency polygon of the binned drops with a GPR. We show that our integral
approach is significantly more accurate, especially in the tail of the
distribution (i.e., large, rare drops), and it reduces the bias of the density
estimator by up to ten times. Finally, we discuss physical aspects of the
model's predictions and interpret them against experimental results from the
literature. This work opens opportunities for modelling drop size distribution
in multiphase flows from data.

play a crucial role for CR transport across a wide range of scales, from
interstellar to galaxy cluster environments. By examining the linear dispersion
relation of CR-driven instabilities in a magnetised electron-ion background
plasma, we establish that both, the intermediate and gyroscale instabilities
have a resonant origin and show that these resonances can be understood via a
simple graphical interpretation. These instabilities destabilise wave modes
parallel to the large-scale background magnetic field at significantly distinct
scales and with very different phase speeds. Furthermore, we show that
approximating the electron-ion background plasma with either
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) or Hall-MHD fails to capture the fastest growing
instability in the linear regime, namely the intermediate-scale instability.
This finding highlights the importance of accurately characterising the
background plasma for resolving the most unstable wave modes. Finally, we
discuss the implications of the different phase speeds of unstable modes on
particle-wave scattering. Further work is needed to investigate the relative
importance of these two instabilities in the non-linear, saturated regime and
to develop a physical understanding of the effective CR transport coefficients

(disentanglement) and generating novel combinations of these concepts

rapid knowledge learning and generalize to new tasks, with which the deep
learning models struggle. Towards human-like intelligence, various works on
disentangled representation learning have been proposed, and recently some
studies on compositional generalization have been presented. However, few works
study the relationship between disentanglement and compositional
generalization, and the observed results are inconsistent. In this paper, we
study several typical disentangled representation learning works in terms of
both disentanglement and compositional generalization abilities, and we provide
an important insight: vector-based representation (using a vector instead of a
scalar to represent a concept) is the key to empower both good disentanglement
and strong compositional generalization. This insight also resonates the
neuroscience research that the brain encodes information in neuron population
activity rather than individual neurons. Motivated by this observation, we
further propose a method to reform the scalar-based disentanglement works
($\beta$-TCVAE and FactorVAE) to be vector-based to increase both capabilities.
We investigate the impact of the dimensions of vector-based representation and
one important question: whether better disentanglement indicates higher
compositional generalization. In summary, our study demonstrates that it is
possible to achieve both good concept recognition and novel concept
composition, contributing an important step towards human-like intelligence.

energy loss is one order of magnitude higher than the expectation of individual
particle stopping models. We attribute this finding to the proximity of beam
ions to each other, which is usually insignificant for relatively-low-current
beams from classical accelerators. The ionization of the cold target by the
intense ion beam is important for the stopping power calculation and has been
considered using proper ionization cross section data. Final theoretical values

disadvantaged students having tighter budgets. This raises a challenge for the
principal: among agents with similar test scores, it is difficult to

  Our main result is an optimal stochastic mechanism that maximizes the gains
achieved from admitting ``high-skill"" students minus the costs incurred from
admitting ``low-skill"" students when considering two skill types and $n$ budget
types. Our mechanism makes it possible to give higher probability of admission

extend our admission problem to a setting in which students uniformly receive

contexts, which is not aligned with the complexity of real-world scenes in the
image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses this
issue by introducing multi-context data generation. Starting with an initial
text corpus, our framework employs a large language model to select multiple
sentences that describe the same scene from various perspectives. These
sentences are then summarized into a single sentence with multiple contexts. We
generate simple images using the straightforward sentences and complex images
using the summarized sentences through diffusion models. Finally, we train the
model exclusively using the synthetic image-text pairs obtained from this
process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework
effectively tackles the central challenge we have identified, achieving the

of eight different algorithms belonging to clustering-based, end-to-end neural
diarization (EEND), and speech separation guided diarization (SSGD) paradigms.
We studied the inference-time computational requirements and diarization
accuracy on four CTS datasets with different characteristics and languages. We
found that, among all methods considered, EEND-vector clustering (EEND-VC)
offers the best trade-off in terms of computing requirements and performance.
More in general, EEND models have been found to be lighter and faster in
inference compared to clustering-based methods. However, they also require a
large amount of diarization-oriented annotated data. In particular EEND-VC
performance in our experiments degraded when the dataset size was reduced,
whereas self-attentive EEND (SA-EEND) was less affected. We also found that
SA-EEND gives less consistent results among all the datasets compared to
EEND-VC, with its performance degrading on long conversations with high speech
sparsity. Clustering-based diarization systems, and in particular VBx, instead
have more consistent performance compared to SA-EEND but are outperformed by
EEND-VC. The gap with respect to this latter is reduced when overlap-aware
clustering methods are considered. SSGD is the most computationally demanding
method, but it could be convenient if speech recognition has to be performed.
Its performance is close to SA-EEND but degrades significantly when the
training and inference data characteristics are less matched.

onto the supermassive black hole releases energy via relativistic jets. The
jets are not constantly active throughout the life of the host galaxy and
alternate between active and quiescent phases. Remnant radio galaxies are
detected during a quiescent phase and define a class of unique sources to
constrain the AGN duty cycle. We present, a spatially resolved radio analysis
of the radio galaxy associated with NGC 6086 and constraints on the spectral
age of the diffuse emission to investigate the duty cycle and evolution of the
source. We use three new low-frequency, high-sensitivity observations,
performed with the Low Frequency Array at 144 MHz and with the upgraded Giant
Metrewave Radio Telescope at 400 MHz and 675 MHz. To these, we add two Very
Large Array archival observations at 1400 and 4700 MHz. In the new
observations, we detect a second pair of larger lobes and three regions with a
filamentary morphology. We analyse the spectral index trend in the inner
remnant lobes and see systematic steeper values at the lower frequencies
compared to the GHz ones. Steeper spectral indices are found in the newly
detected outer lobes (up to 2.1), as expected if they trace a previous phase of
activity of the AGN. However, the differences between the spectra suggest
different dynamical evolution within the intragroup medium during their
expansion and/or different magnetic field values. We place constraints on the
age of the inner and outer lobes and derive the duty cycle of the source. This
results in a total active time of $\sim$39%. The filamentary structures have a
steep spectral index ($\sim$1) without any spectral index trend and only one of
them shows a steepening in the spectrum. Their origin is not yet clear, but
they may have formed due to the compression of the plasma or due to magnetic

that terminate with a few fully connected (FC) layers and an output layer
representing the possible labels of a complex classification task. According to
the existing deep learning (DL) rationale, the first CL reveals localized
features from the raw data, whereas the subsequent layers progressively extract
higher-level features required for refined classification. This article
presents an efficient three-phase procedure for quantifying the mechanism
underlying successful DL. First, a deep architecture is trained to maximize the
success rate (SR). Next, the weights of the first several CLs are fixed and
only the concatenated new FC layer connected to the output is trained,
resulting in SRs that progress with the layers. Finally, the trained FC weights
are silenced, except for those emerging from a single filter, enabling the
quantification of the functionality of this filter using a correlation matrix
between input labels and averaged output fields, hence a well-defined set of
quantifiable features is obtained. Each filter essentially selects a single
output label independent of the input label, which seems to prevent high SRs;
however, it counterintuitively identifies a small subset of possible output
labels. This feature is an essential part of the underlying DL mechanism and is
progressively sharpened with layers, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise
ratios and SRs. Quantitatively, this mechanism is exemplified by the VGG-16,
VGG-6, and AVGG-16. The proposed mechanism underlying DL provides an accurate
tool for identifying each filter's quality and is expected to direct additional
procedures to improve the SR, computational complexity, and latency of DL.

recently, with 3D modelling, virtual/augmented reality, and visual effects

performance since they generalise the ability of the entire NeRF pipeline.
Hence, in this paper, we propose a new test framework which isolates the neural

evaluation by training and evaluating the NeRF on an explicit radiance field
representation. We also introduce a configurable approach for generating
representations specifically for evaluation purposes. This employs ray-casting

understanding the context of outages is a very challenging yet crucial first
step toward mitigating and resolving outages. In current practice, on-call

Oasis first assesses the impact scope of an outage by aggregating relevant
incidents via multiple techniques. Then, it generates a human-readable summary
by leveraging fine-tuned large language models like GPT-3.x. The impact
assessment component of Oasis was introduced in Microsoft over three years ago,
and it is now widely adopted, while the outage summarization component has been

peaks commonly ascribed to excitons. The contribution of this peak to the PL is
boosted around 30-40 K, coinciding with the hidden order magnetic transition
temperature. Our findings reveal the connection between the optical and

However, acquiring paired transcripts is expensive and impractical for

absence of intermediate targets and training guidance for textless SLU often

energy consumption, and significantly enhance the system performance. However,
the phase quantization error generated by IRS with discrete phase shifter may
degrade the receiving performance of the receiver. To analyze the performance
loss caused by IRS phase quantization error, based on the law of large numbers

gradually. When the number of quantization bits is larger than or equal to 3,
the SNR performance loss of the system is smaller than 0.23dB, and the
achievable rate loss is less than 0.04bits/s/Hz, regardless of the LoS channels

statistical model, allowing a first extraction of the kaon PDFs. We find that
both the Drell-Yan and the $J/\psi$ data favor a harder valence distribution
for strange quark than for up quark in kaon. The kaon gluon distribution is
further constrained by the $J/\psi$ production data. In particular, the
momentum fraction carried by gluons is found to be similar for pion and kaon.

assumption in relativistic quantum theory and its relation to questions of
localization of quantum systems. It is shown that the positive energy property
of solutions of relativistic wave equations (such as the Dirac equation) is
very fragile with respect to state transformations beyond free time evolution.
Paying attention to the connection between negative energy Dirac wave functions
and pair creation processes in second quantization, this analysis leads to a
better understanding of a class of problems known as the localization problem
of relativistic quantum theory (associated for instance with famous results of
Newton and Wigner, Reeh and Schlieder, Hegerfeldt or Malament). Finally, this

operational efficiency can effectively enhance service efficiency. However, due
to the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to
errors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and
outbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is
crucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a
collaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on
Safe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we
investigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By
obtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident
response process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on
agents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain
accidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident
response tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the
losses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational
efficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process. A
series of experiments conducted in a simulated unmanned warehouse scenario
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

w^-1/2 singularity in the metallic host density of states. This singularity
occurs at the bottom of the band of a 1D chain, for example. We first analyze
the non-interacting system: A resonant state e_d, located close to the band
singularity, suffers a strong `renormalization', such that a bound state is
created below the bottom of the band in addition to a resonance in the
continuum. When e_d is positioned right at the singularity, the spectral weight
of the bound state is 2/3, irrespective of its coupling to the conduction
electrons. The interacting system is modeled using the Single Impurity Anderson
Model, which is then solved using the Numerical Renormalization Group method.
We observe that the Hubbard interaction causes the bound state to suffer a
series of transformations, including level splitting, transfer of spectral
weight, appearance of a spectral discontinuity, changes in binding energy (the
lowest state moves farther away from the bottom of the band), and development
of a finite width. When e_d is away from the singularity and in the
intermediate valence regime, the impurity occupancy is lower. As e_d moves
closer to the singularity, the system partially recovers Kondo regime
properties, i.e., higher occupancy and lower Kondo temperature T_K. The
impurity thermodynamic properties show that the local moment fixed point is
also strongly affected by the existence of the bound state. When e_d is close
to the singularity, the local moment fixed point becomes impervious to charge
fluctuations (caused by bringing e_d close to the Fermi energy), in contrast to
the local moment suppression that occurs when e_d is away from the singularity.
We also discuss an experimental implementation that shows similar results to
the quantum wire, if the impurity's metallic host is an armchair graphene
nanoribbon.

two types of boundaries in the AdS bulk, namely the usual AdS boundary and the

examining two extremal surfaces: the Hartman-Maldacena (HM) surface and the
island surface. The latter surface emerges when the island appears on the
Planck brane. In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis of dyonic black
holes with regard to the Page curve in the context of the doubly holographic

included in the Planck brane to describe the systems at finite density and
magnetic field. Furthermore, we also develop a general numerical method to
compute the time-dependent HM surface and achieve excellent agreement between
the numerical results and analytical expressions. Utilizing numerical
methodology, we find that the entanglement entropy of dyonic black holes
exhibits unitary evolution over time, wherein it grows in early time and
reaches saturation after the Page time. The initial growth can be explained by
the HM surface, while the saturation is attributed to the island surface. In
addition, using the holographic entanglement density, we also show that, for

Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in doubly holography.

nuclear Skyrme model has, in each topological class, many almost degenerate
local energy minima and that the number of such minima grows with the degree
(or baryon number) $B$. Rigid body quantization, in which one quantizes motion
on the spin-isospin orbit of just one minimum, is thus an ill-justified
approximation. Instead, one should identify a (finite dimensional) moduli space
of configurations containing all local minima (for a given $B$) as well as
fields interpolating smoothly between them. This paper proposes a systematic
computational scheme for generating such a moduli space: one constructs an
energy minimizing path between each pair of local minima, then defines the
moduli space to be the union of spin-isospin orbits of points on the union of
these curves, a principal bundle over a graph. The energy minimizing curves may
be constructed in practice using the nudged elastic band method, a standard
tool in mathematical chemistry for analyzing reaction paths and computing
activation energies.
  To illustrate, we apply this scheme to the lightly bound Skyrme model in the
point particle approximation, constructing the graphs for $5\leq B\leq 10$. We
go on to complete the quantization for $B=7$, in which the graph has two
vertices and a single edge. The low-lying quantum states with isospin $1/2$ do
not strongly localize around either of the local energy minima (the vertices).
Their energies rise monotonically with spin, conflicting with experimental data
for Lithium-7.

scheme to reorder them that saves one CNOT for every SWAP. This scheme also
finds use in the shallow implementation of long-range CNOTs. Our results

preserves both the U(1) symmetry and properties of QA circuits. We find that as
the measurement rate increases, there is a transition from a volume-law phase

logarithmic correction) to a critical phase where it grows logarithmically in

However, the retrieved passages are not ideal for guiding answer generation
because of the discrepancy between retrieval and generation, i.e., the
candidate passages are all treated equally during the retrieval procedure
without considering their potential to generate the proper answers. This
discrepancy makes a passage retriever deliver a sub-optimal collection of
candidate passages to generate answers. In this paper, we propose the
GeneRative Knowledge Improved Passage Ranking (GripRank) approach, addressing
the above challenge by distilling knowledge from a generative passage estimator
(GPE) to a passage ranker, where the GPE is a generative language model used to
measure how likely the candidate passages can generate the proper answer. We
realize the distillation procedure by teaching the passage ranker learning to
rank the passages ordered by the GPE. Furthermore, we improve the distillation
quality by devising a curriculum knowledge distillation mechanism, which allows
the knowledge provided by the GPE can be progressively distilled to the ranker
through an easy-to-hard curriculum, enabling the passage ranker to correctly
recognize the provenance of the answer from many plausible candidates. We
conduct extensive experiments on four datasets across three knowledge-intensive
language tasks. Experimental results show advantages over the state-of-the-art
methods for both passage ranking and answer generation on the KILT benchmark.

formulated without considering the factor of corpus length: shorter corpuses
are harder to detect compared with longer ones for shortage of informative

framework is proposed to address the challenge of multiscale text detection.
Firstly, we acknowledge the human-resemblance property of short machine texts,
and rephrase text classification as a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) problem by
marking these short machine texts as ""unlabeled"" during training. In this PU
context, we propose the length-sensitive Multiscale PU Loss, where we use a
recurrent model in abstraction to estimate positive priors of scale-variant
corpuses. Additionally, we introduce a Text Multiscaling module to enrich
training corpuses. Experiments show that our MPU method augments detection
performance on long AI-generated text, and significantly improves short-corpus

outcompete existing detectors by large margins on multiscale AI-generated

solar system model by incorporating the gravitational influence of Plutinos in
Neptune's 2:3 resonance. We aim to develop the arc model to represent the
global perturbation of Plutinos by taking into account their asymmetric spatial
distribution resulting from the 2:3 resonance, and demonstrate the difference
to the commonly employed ring model. The global perturbation of Plutinos is
measured by the change in the Sun-Neptune distance. We begin by deriving the
number density of the discrete-arc comprised of point masses to accurately
represent the continuous-arc. Based on the resonant characteristics of the 2:3
MMR, we then construct three overlapping discrete-arcs to model the Plutinos.
The perturbations of these arcs are investigated in detail, considering various
azimuthal and radial distributions associated with the resonant amplitudes A
and eccentricities e of the Plutinos, respectively. The change in Sun-Neptune
distance, i.e. $\Delta d_{SN}$, caused by Plutinos increases as the range of A
widens. At e<=0.1, $\Delta d_{SN}$ can reach magnitudes on the order of 100 km.
However, the effects of Plutinos' A and e can possibly balance each other. As
given e>=0.25, we find that $\Delta d_{SN}$ approaches zero, indicating a
negligible contribution from highly eccentric Plutinos to the planetary
ephemerides. We finally provide a concise analytic expression, which contains
the parameters A, e and the total mass of Plutinos, to estimate $\Delta d_{SN}$
at any epoch from 2020 to 2120. Furthermore, since the difference in $\Delta
d_{SN}$ between the arc and ring model can be as large as 170 km, we conclude
that the ring model is unsuitable for representing the perturbations of
Plutinos. The idea of the multiple-arc model designed for Plutinos can be
readily generalized to other MMRs heavily populated by small bodies.

level, practically limiting the development of the field. In this paper, we
take an initial step to explore and propose a unified framework termed OOD
Semantic Pruning (OSP), which aims at pruning OOD semantics out from
in-distribution (ID) features. Specifically, (i) we propose an aliasing OOD
matching module to pair each ID sample with an OOD sample with semantic
overlap. (ii) We design a soft orthogonality regularization, which first
transforms each ID feature by suppressing its semantic component that is
collinear with paired OOD sample. It then forces the predictions before and
after soft orthogonality decomposition to be consistent. Being practically
simple, our method shows a strong performance in OOD detection and ID
classification on challenging benchmarks. In particular, OSP surpasses the
previous state-of-the-art by 13.7% on accuracy for ID classification and 5.9%
on AUROC for OOD detection on TinyImageNet dataset. The source codes are

populations. Existing group fairness methods require equal group-wise measures,
which however fails to consider systematic between-group differences. The
confounding factors, which are non-sensitive variables but manifest systematic

comparison between counterparts (i.e., individuals who are similar to each
other with respect to the task of interest) from different groups, whose group
identities cannot be distinguished algorithmically by exploring confounding
factors. We have developed a propensity-score-based method for identifying

locate the key nodes, and generate a machine-predicted resolution task list. A
human decision-maker supervises the list in real time and modifies and confirms
the machine-predicted list through the human--machine interface. In the task

finite-width deviations grow systematically. Two distinct effects cause these
deviations across widths. First, the network output has
initialization-dependent variance scaling inversely with width, which can be

increases, the optimization approaches a partial differential equation (PDE) in
the continuum limit that is unstable. We show that this instability can
manifest in existing network optimization, leading to irregularities in the
reconstructed surface and/or convergence to sub-optimal local minima, and thus
fails to capture fine geometric and topological structure. We show analytically
how other terms added to the loss, currently used in the literature for other
purposes, can actually eliminate these instabilities. However, such terms can
over-regularize the surface, preventing the representation of fine shape
detail. Based on a similar PDE theory for the continuum limit, we introduce a
new regularization term that still counteracts the eikonal instability but
without over-regularizing. Furthermore, since stability is now guaranteed in
the continuum limit, this stabilization also allows for considering new network
structures that are able to represent finer shape detail. We introduce such a
structure based on quadratic layers. Experiments on multiple benchmark data

intelligence, and have been used increasingly as ways of understanding how the
brain may solve the complex computational problems on which this relies.
However, these still fall short of, and therefore fail to provide insight into
how the brain supports strong forms of generalization of which humans are
capable. One such case is out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization --
successful performance on test examples that lie outside the distribution of
the training set. Here, we identify properties of processing in the brain that
may contribute to this ability. We describe a two-part algorithm that draws on
specific features of neural computation to achieve OOD generalization, and
provide a proof of concept by evaluating performance on two challenging
cognitive tasks. First we draw on the fact that the mammalian brain represents
metric spaces using grid-like representations (e.g., in entorhinal cortex):
abstract representations of relational structure, organized in recurring motifs
that cover the representational space. Second, we propose an attentional
mechanism that operates over these grid representations using determinantal
point process (DPP-A) -- a transformation that ensures maximum sparseness in
the coverage of that space. We show that a loss function that combines standard
task-optimized error with DPP-A can exploit the recurring motifs in grid codes,
and can be integrated with common architectures to achieve strong OOD
generalization performance on analogy and arithmetic tasks. This provides both
an interpretation of how grid codes in the mammalian brain may contribute to
generalization performance, and at the same time a potential means for
improving such capabilities in artificial neural networks.

effective video continual learning based on individual/single frames. Through
extensive experimentation, we show that under extreme memory constraints, video
diversity plays a more significant role than temporal information. Therefore,
our method focuses on learning from a small number of frames that represent a

model-free algorithms, namely the distributionally robust Q-learning and its
variance-reduced counterpart, that can effectively learn a robust policy

approximate the $q$-function of an infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted robust
Markov decision process with Kullback-Leibler uncertainty set to an entry-wise
$\epsilon$-degree of precision. Further, the variance-reduced distributionally
robust Q-learning combines the synchronous Q-learning with variance-reduction

attains a minmax sample complexity upper bound of $\tilde
O(|S||A|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the state and

significantly affect both tire and vehicle performance. The improvement of tire
models is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of advanced vehicle control

Our results demonstrate that RS2 significantly reduces time-to-accuracy

yields accuracy improvements up to 29% compared to competing pruning methods

Decomposition offers a solution by redistributing rewards from observed

trajectory-wise long-term return and further propose a framework, called
Generative Return Decomposition (GRD), for policy optimization in delayed

the identified causal generative model to form a compact representation to
train policy over the most favorable subspace of the state space of the agent.
Theoretically, we show that the unobservable Markovian reward function is

models, methods for lossless visualization of n-D non-numeric categorical data
with visual rule discovery in these visualizations, and accurate and
explainable ML models for categorical data. This study proposes a
classification of mixed data types and analyzes their important role in Machine

operations of ML algorithms on mixed data with a visual data exploration on
mixed data. A new Sequential Rule Generation (SRG) algorithm for explainable
rule generation with categorical data is proposed and successfully evaluated in
multiple computational experiments. This work is one of the steps to the full

(RLHF) where we aim to learn the human's underlying reward and the MDP's
optimal policy from a set of trajectories induced by human choices. RLHF is
challenging for multiple reasons: large state space but limited human feedback,
the bounded rationality of human decisions, and the off-policy distribution
shift. In this paper, we focus on the Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) model for
modeling and understanding human choices. DCC, rooted in econometrics and
decision theory, is widely used to model a human decision-making process with
forward-looking and bounded rationality. We propose a
\underline{D}ynamic-\underline{C}hoice-\underline{P}essimistic-\underline{P}olicy-\underline{O}ptimization
(DCPPO) method. \ The method involves a three-stage process: The first step is
to estimate the human behavior policy and the state-action value function via
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE); the second step recovers the human reward
function via minimizing Bellman mean squared error using the learned value
functions; the third step is to plug in the learned reward and invoke
pessimistic value iteration for finding a near-optimal policy. With only
single-policy coverage (i.e., optimal policy) of the dataset, we prove that the
suboptimality of DCPPO almost matches the classical pessimistic offline RL
algorithm in terms of suboptimality's dependency on distribution shift and
dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first
theoretical guarantees for off-policy offline RLHF with dynamic discrete choice
model.

However, concerns have emerged regarding potential misuse and intellectual
property (IP) infringement associated with these models. Therefore, it is
necessary to analyze the origin of images by inferring if a specific image was
generated by a particular model, i.e., origin attribution. Existing methods are
limited in their applicability to specific types of generative models and
require additional steps during training or generation. This restricts their
use with pre-trained models that lack these specific operations and may
compromise the quality of image generation. To overcome this problem, we first
develop an alteration-free and model-agnostic origin attribution method via
input reverse-engineering on image generation models, i.e., inverting the input
of a particular model for a specific image. Given a particular model, we first
analyze the differences in the hardness of reverse-engineering tasks for the
generated images of the given model and other images. Based on our analysis, we
propose a method that utilizes the reconstruction loss of reverse-engineering
to infer the origin. Our proposed method effectively distinguishes between
generated images from a specific generative model and other images, including
those generated by different models and real images.

true observation, what can be said about the reason behind that deviation? This
is a fundamental and ubiquitous question that the end user in a business or
industrial AI application often asks. The deviation may be due to a sub-optimal
black-box model, or it may be simply because the sample in question is an
outlier. In either case, one would ideally wish to obtain some form of
attribution score -- a value indicative of the extent to which an input
variable is responsible for the anomaly.
  In the present paper we address this task of ``anomaly attribution,''
particularly in the setting in which the model is black-box and the training
data are not available. Specifically, we propose a novel likelihood-based
attribution framework we call the ``likelihood compensation (LC),'' in which
the responsibility score is equated with the correction on each input variable
needed to attain the highest possible likelihood. We begin by showing formally
why mainstream model-agnostic explanation methods, such as the local linear
surrogate modeling and Shapley values, are not designed to explain anomalies.
In particular, we show that they are ``deviation-agnostic,'' namely, that their
explanations are blind to the fact that there is a deviation in the model
prediction for the sample of interest. We do this by positioning these existing
methods under the unified umbrella of a function family we call the
``integrated gradient family.'' We validate the effectiveness of the proposed
LC approach using publicly available data sets. We also conduct a case study
with a real-world building energy prediction task and confirm its usefulness in
practice based on expert feedback.

consider the decentralized setting and develop a variant of POBGA, which not

the total communication complexity from $O(T)$ to $O(\sqrt{T})$.

the freedom to design randomized canaries. Second, we audit LiDP by trying to
distinguish between the model trained with $K$ canaries versus $K - 1$ canaries

can leverage the symmetry in the design and reuse each privately trained model

novel confidence intervals that take advantage of the multiple test statistics

formal definition of ``meaning'' that is amenable to analysis. Then, we
characterize ``meaningful data'' on which large language models (LLMs) are
ostensibly trained, and ``well-trained LLMs'' through conditions that are
largely met by today's LLMs. While a well-trained LLM constructs an embedding
space of meanings that is Euclidean, meanings themselves do not form a vector
(linear) subspace, but rather a quotient space within. We then characterize the
subset of meanings that can be reached by the state of the LLMs for some input
prompt, and show that a well-trained bot can reach any meaning albeit with
small probability. We then introduce a stronger notion of controllability as
{\em almost certain reachability}, and show that, when restricted to the space
of meanings, an AI bot is controllable. We do so after introducing a functional
characterization of attentive AI bots, and finally derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for controllability. The fact that AI bots are
controllable means that an adversary could steer them towards any state.
However, the sampling process can be designed to counteract adverse actions and
avoid reaching undesirable regions of state space before their boundary is

consider the GB's geometric characteristics to construct classification rules,
but the GB's quality is ignored. Therefore, in this paper, based on the
attention mechanism, a fast and stable GBG (GBG++) method is proposed first.
Specifically, the proposed GBG++ method only needs to calculate the distances
from the data-driven center to the undivided samples when splitting each GB,
instead of randomly selecting the center and calculating the distances between
it to all samples. Moreover, an outlier detection method is introduced to
identify local outliers. Consequently, the GBG++ method can significantly

identifying watermarks in LLMs that rely on analyzing distributions of output
tokens and logits generated by watermarked and unmarked LLMs. Notably,
watermarked LLMs tend to produce distributions that diverge qualitatively and
identifiably from standard models. Furthermore, we investigate the
identifiability of watermarks at varying strengths and consider the tradeoffs
of each of our identification mechanisms with respect to watermarking scenario.
Along the way, we formalize the specific problem of identifying watermarks in
LLMs, as well as LLM watermarks and watermark detection in general, providing a
framework and foundations for studying them.

graph learning tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of GNNs can deteriorate
when the input graph data suffer from weak information, i.e., incomplete
structure, incomplete features, and insufficient labels. Most prior studies,
which attempt to learn from the graph data with a specific type of weak
information, are far from effective in dealing with the scenario where diverse
data deficiencies exist and mutually affect each other. To fill the gap, in
this paper, we aim to develop an effective and principled approach to the
problem of graph learning with weak information (GLWI). Based on the findings
from our empirical analysis, we derive two design focal points for solving the
problem of GLWI, i.e., enabling long-range propagation in GNNs and allowing
information propagation to those stray nodes isolated from the largest
connected component. Accordingly, we propose D$^2$PT, a dual-channel GNN
framework that performs long-range information propagation not only on the
input graph with incomplete structure, but also on a global graph that encodes
global semantic similarities. We further develop a prototype contrastive
alignment algorithm that aligns the class-level prototypes learned from two
channels, such that the two different information propagation processes can
mutually benefit from each other and the finally learned model can well handle
the GLWI problem. Extensive experiments on eight real-world benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods in various
GLWI scenarios.

present in the training data of a machine learning model or not, and are widely
used for assessing the privacy risks of language models. Most existing attacks
rely on the observation that models tend to assign higher probabilities to
their training samples than non-training points. However, simple thresholding
of the model score in isolation tends to lead to high false-positive rates as
it does not account for the intrinsic complexity of a sample. Recent work has
demonstrated that reference-based attacks which compare model scores to those
obtained from a reference model trained on similar data can substantially
improve the performance of MIAs. However, in order to train reference models,
attacks of this kind make the strong and arguably unrealistic assumption that
an adversary has access to samples closely resembling the original training
data. Therefore, we investigate their performance in more realistic scenarios
and find that they are highly fragile in relation to the data distribution used
to train reference models. To investigate whether this fragility provides a
layer of safety, we propose and evaluate neighbourhood attacks, which compare
model scores for a given sample to scores of synthetically generated neighbour
texts and therefore eliminate the need for access to the training data
distribution. We show that, in addition to being competitive with
reference-based attacks that have perfect knowledge about the training data
distribution, our attack clearly outperforms existing reference-free attacks as
well as reference-based attacks with imperfect knowledge, which demonstrates
the need for a reevaluation of the threat model of adversarial attacks.

select actions, leading to a significant sim-to-real gap. Existing methods
address this gap by either gradually reducing the reliance on privileged
knowledge or performing a two-stage policy imitation. However, we argue that
these methods are limited in their ability to fully leverage the privileged
knowledge, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a

Historical Information Bottleneck (HIB) to narrow the sim-to-real gap. In
particular, HIB learns a privileged knowledge representation from historical

engineering optimization methods based on physics still outperform generative
models when dealing with constrained environments where data is scarce and
precision is paramount. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffusion
Optimization Models (DOM) and Trajectory Alignment (TA), a learning framework
that demonstrates the efficacy of aligning the sampling trajectory of diffusion
models with the optimization trajectory derived from traditional physics-based
methods. This alignment ensures that the sampling process remains grounded in

state-of-the-art deep generative models on in-distribution configurations and
halves the inference computational cost. When coupled with a few steps of

The proof is essentially based on a novel auxiliary function $\xi$ that helps
eliminate the complexity of handling the correlation between the numerator and
denominator of AdaGrad's update. Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to
obtain tighter results than existing results \citep{faw2022power} and extend
the analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the
over-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm
smaller than $\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly
tighter than existing rates $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.
We then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic
assumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows
local smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary
function $\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a
threshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate
under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,
in contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is
guaranteed regardless of learning rate choices. Together, our analyses broaden
the understanding of AdaGrad and demonstrate the power of the new auxiliary

Predictive Coding (PC) has emerged as a prominent theory underlying information

layer learns to predict the activities of neurons in the previous layer which
enables local computation of error and in-parallel learning across layers. In
this paper, we extend existing PC approaches by developing a network which
supports both feedforward and feedback propagation of information. Each layer
in the networks trained using DBPC learn to predict the activities of neurons
in the previous and next layer which allows the network to simultaneously
perform classification and reconstruction tasks using feedforward and feedback

for learning, thus enabling in-parallel learning across all layers in the

has been evaluated on both, classification and reconstruction tasks using the

performance of networks trained using DBPC is similar to other approaches used

content from each individual image, i.e., the features from frozen patch
embeddings and high-frequency components. Our method freezes a pre-trained
model and then learns task-specific knowledge using a few extra parameters.
Despite introducing only a small number of tunable parameters, EVP achieves
superior performance than full fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient
fine-tuning methods. Experiments in fourteen datasets across five tasks show
the proposed method outperforms other task-specific methods while being
considerably simple. The proposed method demonstrates the scalability in

  Esport Analytics",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Esport games comprise a sizeable fraction of the global games market, and is
the fastest growing segment in games. This has given rise to the domain of
esports analytics, which uses telemetry data from games to inform players,
coaches, broadcasters and other stakeholders. Compared to traditional sports,
esport titles change rapidly, in terms of mechanics as well as rules. Due to
these frequent changes to the parameters of the game, esport analytics models
can have a short life-spam, a problem which is largely ignored within the
literature. This paper extracts information from game design (i.e. patch notes)
and utilises clustering techniques to propose a new form of character
representation. As a case study, a neural network model is trained to predict
the number of kills in a Dota 2 match utilising this novel character
representation technique. The performance of this model is then evaluated
against two distinct baselines, including conventional techniques. Not only did
the model significantly outperform the baselines in terms of accuracy (85%
AUC), but the model also maintains the accuracy in two newer iterations of the
game that introduced one new character and a brand new character type. These
changes introduced to the design of the game would typically break conventional
techniques that are commonly used within the literature. Therefore, the
proposed methodology for representing characters can increase the life-spam of
machine learning models as well as contribute to a higher performance when
compared to traditional techniques typically employed within the literature.

World Health Organization. The alert was renewed in February 2023 due to a
persisting sustained incidence of the virus in several countries and worries
about possible new outbreaks. Low-income countries with inadequate
infrastructures for vaccine and testing administration are particularly at
risk.
  A symptom of mpox infection is the appearance of skin rashes and eruptions,
which can drive people to seek medical advice. A technology that might help
perform a preliminary screening based on the aspect of skin lesions is the use
of Machine Learning for image classification. However, to make this technology

unpolluted, dataset is produced by manual selection and preprocessing of
available image data. It will also be released publicly to researchers in the
field. Then, a thorough comparison is conducted amongst several Convolutional

models are then optimized through quantization for use on mobile devices;
measures of classification quality, memory footprint, and processing times
validate the feasibility of our proposal. Additionally, the use of eXplainable

compiling common usage patterns into a programming language, e.g., Python, it
remains a challenge how to edit and debug an LLM-generated program. We
introduce ANPL, a programming system that allows users to decompose
user-specific tasks. In an ANPL program, a user can directly manipulate sketch,
which specifies the data flow of the generated program. The user annotates the
modules, or hole with natural language descriptions offloading the expensive
task of generating functionalities to the LLM. Given an ANPL program, the ANPL
compiler generates a cohesive Python program that implements the
functionalities in hole, while respecting the dataflows specified in sketch. We
deploy ANPL on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a set of unique
tasks that are challenging for state-of-the-art AI systems, showing it
outperforms baseline programming systems that (a) without the ability to
decompose tasks interactively and (b) without the guarantee that the modules
can be correctly composed together. We obtain a dataset consisting of 300/400
ARC tasks that were successfully decomposed and grounded in Python, providing

achieved tremendous success across a range of domains. Recent work has
investigated such unsupervised pre-training methods for model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL) but is limited to domain-specific or simulated
data. In this paper, we study the problem of pre-training world models with
abundant in-the-wild videos for efficient learning of downstream visual control
tasks. However, in-the-wild videos are complicated with various contextual
factors, such as intricate backgrounds and textured appearance, which precludes
a world model from extracting shared world knowledge to generalize better. To
tackle this issue, we introduce Contextualized World Models (ContextWM) that
explicitly model both the context and dynamics to overcome the complexity and
diversity of in-the-wild videos and facilitate knowledge transfer between
distinct scenes. Specifically, a contextualized extension of the latent
dynamics model is elaborately realized by incorporating a context encoder to
retain contextual information and empower the image decoder, which allows the
latent dynamics model to concentrate on essential temporal variations. Our
experiments show that in-the-wild video pre-training equipped with ContextWM
can significantly improve the sample-efficiency of MBRL in various domains,
including robotic manipulation, locomotion, and autonomous driving.

To address such limitations, we introduce doubly multi-step off-policy VI

speed-up to the optimal policy and is applicable in general off-policy learning

that a deterministic approximation of this process adequately represents the

Finally, we use the perturbation degree of adversarial samples to control the

message of this paper is that, under mild assumptions, the suboptimality of ERM
must be due to large bias rather than variance. More precisely, in the
bias-variance decomposition of the squared error of the ERM, the variance term
necessarily enjoys the minimax rate. In the case of fixed design, we provide an
elementary proof of this fact using the probabilistic method. Then, we prove
this result for various models in the random design setting. In addition, we
provide a simple proof of Chatterjee's admissibility theorem (Chatterjee, 2014,
Theorem 1.4), which states that ERM cannot be ruled out as an optimal method,
in the fixed design setting, and extend this result to the random design
setting. We also show that our estimates imply stability of ERM, complementing
the main result of Caponnetto and Rakhlin (2006) for non-Donsker classes.
Finally, we show that for non-Donsker classes, there are functions close to the

learning model capable of generating human-like text through natural language
processing (NLP). GPT is trained on massive amounts of text data and uses deep
learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data,
enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. This
position paper proposes using GPT technology to generate new process models
when/if needed. We introduce ProcessGPT as a new technology that has the
potential to enhance decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive
processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained
transformer model on a large dataset of business process data. This model can
then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process
flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be
integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and
recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate
repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge
workers to communicate analysis findings, supporting evidence, and make
decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by
offering a powerful tool for process augmentation, automation and improvement.
Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting
data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank
organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to
improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business
operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive
processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a
transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process
workflows.

realm of natural language processing, wielding the power to generate human-like
text. However, despite their potential for content creation, they carry the
risk of eroding our Semantic Capital (SC) - the collective knowledge within our
digital ecosystem - thereby posing diverse social epistemic challenges. This
paper explores the evolution, capabilities, and limitations of these models,
while highlighting ethical concerns they raise. The study contribution is
two-fold: first, it is acknowledged that, withstanding the challenges of
tracking and controlling LLM impacts, it is necessary to reconsider our
interaction with these AI technologies and the narratives that form public
perception of them. It is argued that before achieving this goal, it is
essential to confront a potential deontological tipping point in an increasing
AI-driven infosphere. This goes beyond just adhering to AI ethical norms or
regulations and requires understanding the spectrum of social epistemic risks
LLMs might bring to our collective SC. Secondly, building on Luciano Floridi's
taxonomy for SC risks, those are mapped within the functionality and
constraints of LLMs. By this outlook, we aim to protect and enrich our SC while
fostering a collaborative environment between humans and AI that augments human
intelligence rather than replacing it.

calculate the full photo-luminescence (PL) spectrum. Our approach reveals many
new spin defects with narrow PL line shapes and emission frequencies covering a
broad spectral range. Most of the defects are hosted in hexagonal BN, which we
ascribe to its high stiffness, but some are also found in MgI2, MoS2, MgBr2 and
CaI2. As specific examples, we propose the defects vSMoS0 and NiSMoS0 in MoS2

2\leq p+q\leqslant 2^*$, where $2^*:=\frac{2N}{N-2}$. By using a
Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and careful estimation of $u\log u^2$, firstly,
we will provide a unified proof of the existence of the normalized ground
states solution for all $2\leq p+q\leqslant 2^*$. Secondly, we consider the
stability of normalized ground states solutions. Finally, we analyze the
behavior of solutions for Sobolev-subcritical case and pass the limit as the
exponent $p+q$ approaches to $2^*$. Notably, the uncertainty of sign of $u\log
u^2$ in $(0,+\infty)$ is one of the difficulties of this paper, and also one of
the motivations we are interested in. In particular, we can establish the
existence of positive normalized ground states solutions for the
Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg type problem with logarithmic perturbations (i.e.,
$p+q=2^*$). In addition, our study includes proving the existence of solutions
to the logarithmic type Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem with and without the

refined iteratively based on the user input utterance from each interaction.
The input text from each interaction can be viewed as component modifications

modification patterns. Since these modification patterns could also be combined
with other SQL statements, the models are supposed to have the compositional
generalization to these novel combinations. This work is the first exploration
of compositional generalization in context-dependent Text-to-SQL scenarios. To
facilitate related studies, we constructed two challenging benchmarks named
\textsc{CoSQL-CG} and \textsc{SParC-CG} by recombining the modification
patterns and existing SQL statements. The following experiments show that all
current models struggle on our proposed benchmarks. Furthermore, we found that
better aligning the previous SQL statements with the input utterance could give
models better compositional generalization ability. Based on these

compositional generalization of Text-to-SQL models. Further experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method. Source code and data are available.

heart. It can be a sign of a serious heart condition, so detecting heart
murmurs is critical for identifying and managing cardiovascular diseases.
However, current methods for identifying murmurous heart sounds do not fully
utilize the valuable insights that can be gained by exploring intrinsic
properties of heart sound signals. To address this issue, this study proposes a
new discriminatory set of multiscale features based on the self-similarity and
complexity properties of heart sounds, as derived in the wavelet domain.
Self-similarity is characterized by assessing fractal behaviors, while
complexity is explored by calculating wavelet entropy. We evaluated the
diagnostic performance of these proposed features for detecting murmurs using a
set of standard classifiers. When applied to a publicly available heart sound
dataset, our proposed wavelet-based multiscale features achieved comparable
performance to existing methods with fewer features. This suggests that
self-similarity and complexity properties in heart sounds could be potential
biomarkers for improving the accuracy of murmur detection.

While much of the research has focused on simulating closed quantum systems,
the real-world quantum systems are mostly open. Therefore, it is essential to
develop quantum algorithms that can effectively simulate open quantum systems.
Here we present an adaptive variational quantum algorithm for simulating open
quantum system dynamics described by the Lindblad equation. The algorithm is
designed to build resource-efficient ansatze through the dynamical addition of
operators by maintaining the simulation accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of our algorithm on both noiseless simulators and IBM quantum processors and
observe good quantitative and qualitative agreement with the exact solution. We
also investigate the scaling of the required resources with system size and
accuracy and find polynomial behavior. Our results demonstrate that near-future
quantum processors are capable of simulating open quantum systems.

detailed routing (DR), the tasks of timing prediction and optimization pose
major challenges. Inaccurate timing prediction wastes design effort, hurts
circuit performance, and may lead to design failure. This work focuses on
timing prediction after clock tree synthesis and placement legalization, which
is the earliest opportunity to time and optimize a ""complete"" netlist. The
paper first documents that having ""oracle knowledge"" of the final post-DR
parasitics enables post-global routing (GR) optimization to produce improved
final timing outcomes. To bridge the gap between GR-based parasitic and timing
estimation and post-DR results during post-GR optimization, machine learning
(ML)-based models are proposed, including the use of features for macro
blockages for accurate predictions for designs with macros. Based on a set of
experimental evaluations, it is demonstrated that these models show higher
accuracy than GR-based timing estimation. When used during post-GR
optimization, the ML-based models show demonstrable improvements in post-DR
circuit performance. The methodology is applied to two different tool flows -
OpenROAD and a commercial tool flow - and results on 45nm bulk and 12nm FinFET
enablements show improvements in post-DR slack metrics without increasing
congestion. The models are demonstrated to be generalizable to designs
generated under different clock period constraints and are robust to training
data with small levels of noise.

simultaneously learn the discriminant features of image and text modalities

transferring the positive knowledge between image and text modalities during

truncated-Kullback-Leibler divergence loss Tr-KLD-Reg as a new regularization

this is the first time to leverage a mutual learning approach along with a
self-attention-based fusion module to perform document image classification.
The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms

efficacy, for example in search and rescue missions where communication-denied

such as human survivors, but they might get trapped at hazardous locations,
such as in a trapping pit or by debris. Thus, the information the robot
collected is lost owing to the lack of communication. In our prior work, we
developed the notion of a path-based sensor. A path-based sensor detects
whether or not an event has occurred along a particular path, but it does not
provide the exact location of the event. Such path-based sensor observations
are well-suited to communication-denied environments, and various studies have
explored methods to improve information gathering in such settings. In some
missions it is typical for target elements to be in close proximity to
hazardous factors that hinder the information-gathering process. In this study,
we examine a similar scenario and conduct experiments to determine if
additional knowledge about the correlation between hazards and targets improves
the efficiency of information gathering. To incorporate this knowledge, we
utilize a Bayesian network representation of domain knowledge and develop an
algorithm based on this representation. Our empirical investigation reveals
that such additional information on correlation is beneficial only in
environments with moderate hazard lethality, suggesting that while knowledge of
correlation helps, further research and development is necessary for optimal

attention due to its promising performance. However, existing DMVSC methods
still have two issues: (1) they mainly focus on using autoencoders to
nonlinearly embed the data, while the embedding may be suboptimal for
clustering because the clustering objective is rarely considered in
autoencoders, and (2) existing methods typically have a quadratic or even cubic
complexity, which makes it challenging to deal with large-scale data. To
address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel deep multi-view subspace
clustering method with anchor graph (DMCAG). To be specific, DMCAG firstly
learns the embedded features for each view independently, which are used to
obtain the subspace representations. To significantly reduce the complexity, we
construct an anchor graph with small size for each view. Then, spectral
clustering is performed on an integrated anchor graph to obtain pseudo-labels.
To overcome the negative impact caused by suboptimal embedded features, we use
pseudo-labels to refine the embedding process to make it more suitable for the
clustering task. Pseudo-labels and embedded features are updated alternately.
Furthermore, we design a strategy to keep the consistency of the labels based
on contrastive learning to enhance the clustering performance. Empirical
studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior
clustering performance over other state-of-the-art methods.

many machine learning models are distributed across multiple nodes using

  In this work, we propose fusing computation with communication using
GPU-initiated networking, and leverage GPUs' massive parallelism to enable
fine-grained overlap of the fused operations. We have developed a single,
self-contained GPU kernel where workgroups (WGs) immediately communicate their
results to remote GPUs when they complete their computation. Meanwhile, other
WGs within the same kernel perform overlapping computation, maintaining high
ALU utilization. Furthermore, we propose zero-copy optimizations for

written to the destination buffers within the peer GPUs, eliminating
intermediate stores and extra buffering. Our approach leverages the emerging
multi-node GPU system trend where GPUs are physically close to network with
direct GPU-NIC interconnects. We demonstrate our approach by creating an
embedding + All-to-All fused kernel which overlaps embedding operations and the

effectively overlap All-to-All communication with embedding computations,
subsequently reducing their combined execution time by 31% on average (up to

reactions. The latter are modelled as dissipative processes which involve
losses of pairs $2A \to \emptyset$, triplets $3A \to \emptyset$ and quadruplets
$4A \to \emptyset$ of neighbouring particles. When considering classical
particles, the corresponding decay of their density in time follows an
asymptotic power-law behavior. The associated exponent in one dimension is
different from the mean-field prediction whenever diffusive mixing is not too
strong and spatial correlations are relevant. This specifically applies to
$2A\to \emptyset$, while the mean-field prediction just acquires a log
correction for $3A \to \emptyset$ and is exact for $4A \to \emptyset$. A
mean-field approach is also valid, for all the three processes, when the
diffusive mixing is strong, i.e., in the so-called reaction-limited regime.
Here, we show that the picture is quite different for quantum systems. We
consider the quantum reaction-limited regime and we show that for all the three
processes power-law behavior beyond mean-field is present as a consequence of
quantum coherences, which are not related to space dimensionality. In the case
of $3A\to \emptyset$, we further show that power-law behavior only appears
within an intermediate time window, while at long times the density decay is
not power-law. Our results show the markedly different origin of the richer
universal behavior in quantum reaction-diffusion dynamics as compared to its
classical formulation.

  Transmitter Fingerprinting","13 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.CR eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to an increase in the availability of cheap off-the-shelf radio hardware,
spoofing and replay attacks on satellite ground systems have become more
accessible than ever. This is particularly a problem for legacy systems, many
of which do not offer cryptographic security and cannot be patched to support
novel security measures.
  In this paper we explore radio transmitter fingerprinting in satellite
systems. We introduce the SatIQ system, proposing novel techniques for
authenticating transmissions using characteristics of transmitter hardware
expressed as impairments on the downlinked signal. We look in particular at
high sample rate fingerprinting, making fingerprints difficult to forge without
similarly high sample rate transmitting hardware, thus raising the budget for
attacks. We also examine the difficulty of this approach with high levels of
atmospheric noise and multipath scattering, and analyze potential solutions to
this problem.
  We focus on the Iridium satellite constellation, for which we collected
1010464 messages at a sample rate of 25 MS/s. We use this data to train a
fingerprinting model consisting of an autoencoder combined with a Siamese
neural network, enabling the model to learn an efficient encoding of message
headers that preserves identifying information.
  We demonstrate the system's robustness under attack by replaying messages
using a Software-Defined Radio, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 0.120, and ROC
AUC of 0.946. Finally, we analyze its stability over time by introducing a time
gap between training and testing data, and its extensibility by introducing new
transmitters which have not been seen before. We conclude that our techniques
are useful for building systems that are stable over time, can be used
immediately with new transmitters without retraining, and provide robustness
against spoofing and replay by raising the required budget for attacks.

represent similar health states in different individuals and at different times
within the same individual to result in the minimum possible false-positive and
false-negative rates. The application of standard cut-off points and risk
scores across populations hinges upon the assumption of such generalizability.
Such generalizability, in turn, hinges upon this condition that the phenomenon
investigated by current statistical methods is ergodic, i.e., its statistical
measures converge over individuals and time within the finite limit of
observations. However, emerging evidence indicates that biological processes
abound with non-ergodicity, threatening this generalizability. Here, we present
a solution for how to make generalizable inferences by deriving ergodic
descriptions of non-ergodic phenomena. For this aim, we proposed capturing the
origin of ergodicity-breaking in many biological processes: cascade dynamics.
To assess our hypotheses, we embraced the challenge of identifying reliable
biomarkers for heart disease and stroke, which, despite being the leading cause
of death worldwide and decades of research, lacks reliable biomarkers and risk
stratification tools. We showed that raw R-R interval data and its common
descriptors based on mean and variance are non-ergodic and non-specific. On the
other hand, the cascade-dynamical descriptors, the Hurst exponent encoding
linear temporal correlations, and multifractal nonlinearity encoding nonlinear
interactions across scales described the non-ergodic heart rate variability
ergodically and were specific. This study inaugurates applying the critical
concept of ergodicity in discovering and applying digital biomarkers of health

coupling, so that it mimicks a variation of the paradigmatic
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, which features a nontrivial topological phase and
hosts topological edge states. In the strong-coupling regime, the cavity
photons hybridize the bright dipolar bulk band into a polaritonic one,
renormalizing the eigenspectrum and strongly breaking chiral symmetry. This
leads to a formal loss of the in-gap edge states present in the topological
phase while they merge into the polaritonic bulk band. Interestingly, however,
we find that bulk polaritons entering in resonance with the edge states inherit
part of their localization properties, so that multiple polaritonic edge states
are observed. Although these states are not fully localized on the edges, they
present unusual properties. In particular, due to their delocalized bulk part,
owing from their polaritonic nature, such edge states exhibit efficient
transport characteristics. Instead of being degenerate, they occupy a large
portion of the spectrum, allowing one to probe them in a wide driving frequency
range. Moreover, being reminiscent of symmetry-protected topological edge
states, they feature a strong tolerance to off-diagonal disorder.

a language translation problem. Radiographs and CT images are first embedded
into latent quantized codebook vectors using two different autoencoder

sensor input from the CARLA simulator with additive noise, a LiDAR perception
system is designed to detect and track all surrounding vehicles and to provide
precise orientation and velocity information. Next, we introduce a new

evaluate the joint simulation framework in CARLA for urban driving scenarios.
Experiments show that our proposed automated driving system can execute at 25

accuracy within 20 meters when evaluated with the ground truth. The motion
planning results in consistent safe distance keeping when tested in CARLA urban

experienced enormous progress in both engineering and scientific research. It
is therefore essential to ensure that the modifications in the source code

this in mind, this paper introduces a method for developing and implementing an
automatic regression test environment and takes the open-source multi-physics
library SPHinXsys \cite{zhang2021sphinxsys} as an example. Firstly, the
reference database for each benchmark test is generated from monitored data by
multiple executions. This database contains the maximum variation range of
metrics for different types of strategies, i.e., time-averaged method,
ensemble-averaged method as well as the dynamic time warping method, covering
the uncertainty arising from parallel computing, particle relaxation, physical
instabilities, etc. Then, new results obtained after source code modification
will be tested with them according to a curve-similarity based comparison.
Whenever the source code is updated, the regression test will be carried out
automatically for all test cases and used to report the validity of the current
results. This regression test environment has already been implemented in all
dynamics test cases released in SPHinXsys, including fluid dynamics, solid
mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, thermal and mass diffusion,
reaction-diffusion, and their multi-physics coupling, and shows good capability
for testing various problems. It's worth noting that while the present test
environment is built and implemented for a specific scientific computing
library, its underlying principle is generic and can be applied to many others.

the presence of an additional parameter allows tuning the position of soliton.
We find that the proposed scheme of bilinearization using auxiliary function,

than the one reported earlier. We show that the obtained soliton solution
reduces to an algebraic soliton in the limit of infinite width. Further we show
explicitly that the soliton interactions are elastic through asymptotic

around, So, the question is whether we can give the areas where partiality
occurs, that is, where non-termination happens more structure. In this paper we
consider function classes which besides the total functions only contain finite
functions whose domain of definition is an initial segment of the natural
numbers. Such functions appear naturally in computation. We show that a rich
computability theory can be developed for these functions classes which
embraces the central results of classical computability theory, in which all
partial (computable) functions are considered. To do so the concept of a
G\""odel number is generalised, resulting in a broader class of numberings. The
central algorithmic idea in this approach is to search in enumerated lists. By
this way the notion of computation is reduced to that of enumeration. Beside of
the development of a computability theory for the functions classes, the new
numberings -- called quasi-G\""odel numberings -- are studied from a
numbering-theoretic perspective: they are complete, and each of the function
classes numbered in this way is a retract of the G\""odel numbered set of all
partial computable functions. Moreover, the Rogers semi-lattice of all
computable numberings of the considered function classes is studied and results
as in the case of the computable numberings of the partial computable functions
are obtained. The function classes are shown to be effectively given algebraic
domains in the sense of Scott-Ershov. The quasi-G\""odel numberings are exactly
the admissible numberings of the domain. Moreover, the domain can be computable
mapped onto every other effectively given one so that every admissible

the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a

  Models","ACL 2023; code and data released at
  https://github.com/ehsk/OpenQA-eval",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain
question answering (QA). Unfortunately, lexical matching fails completely when
a plausible candidate answer does not appear in the list of gold answers, which
is increasingly the case as we shift from extractive to generative models. The
recent success of large language models (LLMs) for QA aggravates lexical
matching failures since candidate answers become longer, thereby making
matching with the gold answers even more challenging. Without accurate
evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper,
we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including
LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-open, a popular
benchmark. Our assessments reveal that while the true performance of all models
is significantly underestimated, the performance of the InstructGPT (zero-shot)
LLM increases by nearly +60%, making it on par with existing top models, and
the InstructGPT (few-shot) model actually achieves a new state-of-the-art on
NQ-open. We also find that more than 50% of lexical matching failures are
attributed to semantically equivalent answers. We further demonstrate that
regex matching ranks QA models consistent with human judgments, although still
suffering from unnecessary strictness. Finally, we demonstrate that automated
evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some
circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated
models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable
to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human
evaluation.

attain full capacity of 0.75 bit/user. Furthermore, we derive density evolution

how neural networks learn hierarchical features. The ability of deep networks
to extract salient features is crucial to both their outstanding generalization
ability and the modern deep learning paradigm of pretraining and finetuneing.
However, this feature learning process remains poorly understood from a
theoretical perspective, with existing analyses largely restricted to two-layer
networks. In this work we show that three-layer neural networks have provably
richer feature learning capabilities than two-layer networks. We analyze the
features learned by a three-layer network trained with layer-wise gradient
descent, and present a general purpose theorem which upper bounds the sample
complexity and width needed to achieve low test error when the target has
specific hierarchical structure. We instantiate our framework in specific
statistical learning settings -- single-index models and functions of quadratic
features -- and show that in the latter setting three-layer networks obtain a
sample complexity improvement over all existing guarantees for two-layer
networks. Crucially, this sample complexity improvement relies on the ability
of three-layer networks to efficiently learn nonlinear features. We then
establish a concrete optimization-based depth separation by constructing a
function which is efficiently learnable via gradient descent on a three-layer
network, yet cannot be learned efficiently by a two-layer network. Our work
makes progress towards understanding the provable benefit of three-layer neural

can often lead to missing important visual cues. Although humans often find a
video moment to focus on and rewind the moment to answer questions, training a
query-aware video moment localizer often requires expensive annotations and
high computational costs. To address this issue, we propose Self-Chained Video
Localization-Answering (SeViLA), a novel framework that leverages a single
image-language model (BLIP-2) to tackle both temporal keyframe localization and
QA on videos. SeViLA framework consists of two modules: Localizer and Answerer,
where both are parameter-efficiently fine-tuned from BLIP-2. We chain these
modules for cascaded inference and self-refinement. First, in the forward
chain, the Localizer finds multiple language-aware keyframes in a video, which
the Answerer uses to predict the answer. Second, in the reverse chain, the
Answerer generates keyframe pseudo-labels to refine the Localizer, alleviating
the need for expensive video moment localization annotations. SeViLA
outperforms several strong baselines/previous works on five video QA and event
prediction tasks, and achieves the state-of-the-art in both fine-tuning

societal impact raised concerns about unfair (disparate) results for different

these models mainly learn the underlying user preference from historical
behavior data, and then estimate the user-item matching relationships for
recommendations. Inspired by the recent progress on large language models
(LLMs), we take a different approach to developing the recommendation models,
considering recommendation as instruction following by LLMs. The key idea is
that the preferences or needs of a user can be expressed in natural language
descriptions (called instructions), so that LLMs can understand and further
execute the instruction for fulfilling the recommendation task. Instead of
using public APIs of LLMs, we instruction tune an open-source LLM (3B
Flan-T5-XL), in order to better adapt LLMs to recommender systems. For this
purpose, we first design a general instruction format for describing the
preference, intention, task form and context of a user in natural language.
Then we manually design 39 instruction templates and automatically generate a
large amount of user-personalized instruction data (252K instructions) with
varying types of preferences and intentions. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, we instantiate the instruction templates into several
widely-studied recommendation (or search) tasks, and conduct extensive
experiments on these tasks with real-world datasets. Experiment results show
that the proposed approach can outperform several competitive baselines,
including the powerful GPT-3.5, on these evaluation tasks. Our approach sheds
light on developing more user-friendly recommender systems, in which users can
freely communicate with the system and obtain more accurate recommendations via
natural language instructions.

prompting (XLT), to systematically improve the multilingual capability of LLMs.
Specifically, XLT is a generic template prompt that stimulates cross-lingual
and logical reasoning skills to enhance task performance across languages. We
conduct comprehensive evaluations on 7 typical benchmarks related to reasoning,
understanding, and generation tasks, covering both high-resource and
low-resource languages. Experimental results show that XLT not only remarkably
enhances the performance of various multilingual tasks but also significantly
reduces the gap between the average performance and the best performance of
each task in different languages. Notably, XLT brings over 10 points of average
improvement in arithmetic reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks.

translation and other (conditional) language models. They are applied to
datasets before training, so translation or text generation quality relies on
the quality of segmentations. We propose a departure from this paradigm, called
subword segmental machine translation (SSMT). SSMT unifies subword segmentation
and MT in a single trainable model. It learns to segment target sentence words
while jointly learning to generate target sentences. To use SSMT during
inference we propose dynamic decoding, a text generation algorithm that adapts
segmentations as it generates translations. Experiments across 6 translation
directions show that SSMT improves chrF scores for morphologically rich
agglutinative languages. Gains are strongest in the very low-resource scenario.
SSMT also learns subwords that are closer to morphemes compared to baselines
and proves more robust on a test set constructed for evaluating morphological

buyers. Each buyer has a value on the good as his private information. The
seller only knows the empirical value distribution of the buyer population and
chooses the revenue-optimal price. We consider a widely studied third-degree
price discrimination model where an information intermediary with perfect
knowledge of the arriving buyer's value sends a signal to the seller, hence
changing the seller's posterior and inducing the seller to set a personalized
posted price. Prior work of Bergemann, Brooks, and Morris (American Economic
Review, 2015) has shown the existence of a signaling scheme that preserves
seller revenue, while always selling the item, hence maximizing consumer
surplus. In a departure from prior work, we ask whether the consumer surplus
generated is fairly distributed among buyers with different values. To this
end, we aim to maximize welfare functions that reward more balanced surplus
allocations.
  Our main result is the surprising existence of a novel signaling scheme that
simultaneously $8$-approximates all welfare functions that are non-negative,
monotonically increasing, symmetric, and concave, compared with any other
signaling scheme. Classical examples of such welfare functions include the
utilitarian social welfare, the Nash welfare, and the max-min welfare. Such a
guarantee cannot be given by any consumer-surplus-maximizing scheme -- which
are the ones typically studied in the literature. In addition, our scheme is
socially efficient, and has the fairness property that buyers with higher
values enjoy higher expected surplus, which is not always the case for existing
schemes.

extensively to search for Majorana modes. The presence of disorder-induced
low-energy states may lead to the non-existence of end Majorana zero modes even
when tunneling spectroscopy manifests zero bias conductance peaks in local
tunneling and signatures of bulk gap closing/reopening in the nonlocal

topology may manifest in small ranges (""patches"") of parameter values, which
may or may not survive the long wire limit depending on various details.
Because of the dominance of disorder-induced in-gap states, the system may even
occasionally have an appropriate topological invariant without manifesting
isolated end Majorana zero modes. We discuss our findings in the context of a

which is shown here to be at the origin of the structural behavior of MHPs as a
function of temperature, pressure and composition. The application of high
hydrostatic pressure allows for unraveling the nature of the interaction
between both sublattices, characterized by the simultaneous action of hydrogen
bonding and steric hindrance. In particular, we find that under the conditions
of unleashed cation dynamics, the key factor that determines the structural
stability of MHPs is the repulsive steric interaction rather than hydrogen
bonding. Taking as example the results from pressure and temperature-dependent
photoluminescence and Raman experiments on MAPbBr$_3$ but also considering the
pertinent MHP literature, we provide a general picture about the relationship
between the crystal structure and the presence or absence of cationic dynamic
disorder. The reason for the structural sequences observed in MHPs with
increasing temperature, pressure, A-site cation size or decreasing halide ionic
radius is found principally in the strengthening of the dynamic steric
interaction with the increase of the dynamic disorder. In this way, we have
deepened our fundamental understanding of MHPs; knowledge that could be coined

The challenge is to achieve both photorealism and view consistency. We present
SparseGNV: a learning framework that incorporates 3D structures and image
generative models to generate novel views with three modules. The first module
builds a neural point cloud as underlying geometry, providing contextual
information and guidance for the target novel view. The second module utilizes
a transformer-based network to map the scene context and the guidance into a
shared latent space and autoregressively decodes the target view in the form of
discrete image tokens. The third module reconstructs the tokens into the image
of the target view. SparseGNV is trained across a large indoor scene dataset to
learn generalizable priors. Once trained, it can efficiently generate novel
views of an unseen indoor scene in a feed-forward manner. We evaluate SparseGNV
on both real-world and synthetic indoor scenes and demonstrate that it
outperforms state-of-the-art methods based on either neural radiance fields or
conditional image generation.

apply Nesterov's acceleration and adaptive restart to improve convergence while

  Attention","CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model
capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy
computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In
this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named
EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly
bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and
element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with
a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN
layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication.
Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across
heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a
cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits
of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves
attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT
outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed
and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by
1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia
V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient
model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while
running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX

propagation effects or due to clusters of sources. We show that while extended
neutrino sources could be missed in the commonly used muon-track channel, they
could be discovered in the all-flavor shower channel, which has a lower
atmospheric-neutrino background flux per solid angle. Intrinsically, showers
are quite directional and would appear so in water-based detectors like the

LF) inferred from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The UV LF covers the same
redshifts ($z\approx 7-10$) and host-halo masses $(M_\mathrm{h}\approx

rate rather than stellar mass. We consider beyond-$\Lambda$CDM power-spectrum
enhancements and show that any departure large enough to reproduce the
abundance of ultra-massive JWST candidates is in conflict with the HST data.
Our analysis, therefore, severely disfavors a cosmological explanation for the

performing hydrodynamical simulations of a galactic disc, we investigate how
much tracer particles, which are initially located in the disc to mimic newborn
stars and the thin and thick disc stars, are displaced from initial
near-circular orbits by gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds
(GMCs). To exclude the influence of other perturbers that can change the
stellar orbits, such as spiral arms and the bar, we use an axisymmetric form
for the entire galactic potential. First, we investigate the time evolution of
the radial and vertical velocity dispersion $\sigma_R$ and $\sigma_z$ by
comparing them with a power law relation of $\sigma \propto t^{\beta}$.
Although the exponents $\beta$ decrease with time, they keep large values of
0.3 $\sim$ 0.6 for 1 Gyr, indicating fast and efficient disc heating. Next, we
find that the efficient stellar scattering by GMCs also causes a change in
angular momentum for each star and, therefore, radial migration. This effect is
more pronounced in newborn stars than old disc stars; nearly 30 per cent of
stars initially located on the galactic mid-plane move more than 1 kpc in the
radial direction for 1 Gyr. The dynamical heating and radial migration
drastically occur in the first several hundred Myr. As the amplitude of the
vertical oscillation increases, the time spent in the galactic plane, where
most GMCs are distributed, decreases, and the rate of an increase in the

theory: Each nodal point effectively generates a Landau-level problem which is
strictly two-dimensional to leading order in the applied strain. While the

COSMOS. We introduce the N2CLS survey and present new 1.2 and 2 mm number count
measurements based on the tiered N2CLS observations from October 2017 to May

  Methods. We develop an end-to-end simulation that combines an input sky model
with the instrument noise and data reduction pipeline artifacts. This
simulation is used to compute the sample purity, flux boosting, pipeline
transfer function, completeness, and effective area of the survey. We used the
117 deg$^2$ SIDES simulations as the sky model, which include the galaxy
clustering. Our formalism allows us to correct the source number counts to
obtain galaxy number counts, the difference between the two being due to
resolution effects caused by the blending of several galaxies inside the large
beam of single-dish instruments.
  Results. The N2CLS-May2021 survey reaches an average 1-$\sigma$ noise level
of 0.17 and 0.048 mJy on GOODS-N over 159 arcmin$^2$, and 0.46 and 0.14 mJy on

the structure formation below their free streaming scale. Cosmic microwave
background (CMB) observations at small angular scales can be used to constrain
the total mass $\Sigma m_\nu$ of the three neutrino flavors. However, at these
scales, the CMB-measured $\Sigma m_\nu$ is degenerate with $\tau$, the optical
depth to reionization, which quantifies the damping of CMB anisotropies due to
the scattering of CMB photons with free electrons along the line of sight. Here
we revisit the idea to use 21-cm power spectrum observations to provide direct
estimates for $\tau$. A joint analysis of CMB and 21-cm data can alleviate the
$\tau-\Sigma m_\nu$ degeneracy, making it possible to measure $\Sigma m_\nu$
with unprecedented precision. Forecasting for the upcoming Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA), we find that a $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10\%)$

decade, limited attention has been paid to the planets around binary stars.
Circumbinary planets (CBPs) have been discovered primarily around Main Sequence
(MS) stars. No exoplanet has been found orbiting double white dwarf (DWD)
binaries yet. We modelled the long-term evolution of CBPs, throughout the life
stages of their hosts, from MS to white dwarf (WD). Our goal is to provide the
community with both theoretical constraints on CBPs evolution beyond the MS and
the occurrence rates of planet survival. We further developed the publicly
available Triple Evolution Simulation (TRES) code, implementing a variety of
physical processes affecting substellar bodies. We then used this code to
simulate the evolution, up to one Hubble time, of two synthetic populations of
circumbinary giant planets. Each population has been generated using different
priors for the planetary orbital parameters. In our simulated populations we
identified several evolutionary categories, such as survived, merged, and
destabilised systems. Our primary focus is those systems where the planet
survived the entire system evolution and orbits a DWD binary, which we call
""Magrathea"" planets. We found that a significant fraction of simulated CBPs
survive and become Magratheas. In the absence of multi-planet migration
mechanisms, this category of planets is characterised by long orbital periods.
Magrathea planets are a natural outcome of triple systems evolution, and they
could be relatively common in the Galaxy. They can survive the death of their
binary hosts if they orbit far enough to avoid engulfment and instabilities.
Our results can ultimately be a reference to orient future observations of this
uncharted class of planets and to compare different theoretical models.

adopts spectrum synthesis with LTE MARCS model atmospheres, along with the

metallicities, and projected rotational velocities. The median metallicity
obtained for the Hyades M dwarfs is [M/H]= 0.09$\pm$0.03 dex, indicating a
small internal uncertainty and good agreement with optical results for Hyades
red-giants. Overall, the median radii are larger than predicted by stellar
models by 1.6$\pm$2.3\% and 2.4$\pm$2.3\%, relative to a MIST and DARTMOUTH
isochrone, respectively. We emphasize, however, that these isochrones are
different and the fractional radius inflation for the fully- and
partially-convective regimes have distinct behaviors depending on the
isochrone. Using a MIST isochrone there is no evidence of radius inflation for
the fully convective stars, while for the partially convective M-dwarfs the
radii are inflated by 2.7$\pm$2.1\%, which is in agreement with predictions
from models that include magnetic fields. For the partially-convective stars,
rapid-rotators present on average higher inflation levels than slow-rotators.
The comparison with SPOTS isochrone models indicates that the derived M dwarf
radii can be explained by accounting for stellar spots in the photosphere of
the stars, with 76\% of the studied M dwarfs having up to 20\% spot coverage,
and the most inflated stars with $\sim$20 -- 40\% spot coverage.

formation at high redshift gives rise to temporarily quenched, or miniquenched
galaxies in the mass range $M_{\star} = 10^7-10^9 \ M_{\odot}$ using three
models of galaxy formation: the periodic box simulation IllustrisTNG, the
zoom-in simulation VELA and an empirical halo model. The main causes for
mini-quenching are stellar feedback, lack of gas accretion onto galaxies and
galaxy-galaxy interactions. The abundance of mini-quenching events agrees
across the three models: the population first appears below $z\sim 8$, after
which the fraction of miniquenched galaxies increases with cosmic time, from
$\sim 0.5$% at $z=7$ to $\sim 1-2$% at $z=4$, corresponding to comoving number
densities of $8.0\times 10^{-6}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ and $5.4\times 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$,
respectively. The star formation rate duty cycle ($f_{\mathrm{duty}}\sim
99.56^{+0.4}_{-4.5}$% at $z=7$) inferred for VELA galaxies is consistent
therewith. Star formation histories (SFHs) in VELA suggest that mini-quenching
at $z=4-8$ is short-lived with a duration of $\sim 20-40$ Myr, which is close
to the free-fall timescale of the inner halo. However, mock spectral energy
distributions of miniquenched galaxies in IllustrisTNG and VELA do not match
JADES-GS-z7-01-QU photometry, unless their SFHs are artificially altered to be
more bursty on timescales of $\sim 40$ Myr. Studying miniquenched galaxies
might aid in calibrating the sub-grid models governing galaxy formation, as
these may not generate sufficient burstiness at high redshift to explain the
SFH inferred for JADES-GS-z7-01-QU.

approaches rely on source code, or a collection of known signatures from
incomplete databases or incomplete heuristic rules, which, however, are far

type-aware symbolic execution (TASE) that utilizes the semantics of EVM
operations on parameters to identify the number and the types of parameters.

contract bytecode without the need of source code and function signature

scaling (GIS) or simultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique
(SMART) and its rescaled block-iterative version (RBI-SMART) in the field of
optimal transport (OT). Many OT problems can be tackled through the use of
entropic regularization by solving the Schr\""odinger problem, which is an
information projection problem, that is, with respect to the Kullback--Leibler
divergence. Here we consider problems that have several affine constraints. It
is well-known that cyclic information projections onto the individual affine
sets converge to the solution. In practice, however, even these individual
projections are not explicitly available in general. In this paper, we exchange
them for one GIS iteration. If this is done for every affine set, we obtain
RBI-SMART. We provide a convergence proof using an interpretation of these
iterations as two-step affine projections in an equivalent problem. This is
done in a slightly more general setting than RBI-SMART, since we use a mix of
explicitly known information projections and GIS iterations. We proceed to

measure that minimizes the regularized OT divergence to a given measure under

We find reasonable agreement of our results with simulations taking into

of paramount importance in holography. In this work, we begin addressing this
question from a modern bootstrap perspective. Our main tool is the boundary
operator expansion (BOE), which holds for any QFT in AdS. Following Kabat and
Lifschytz, we argue that the BOE is strongly constrained by demanding locality
of correlators involving bulk fields. Focusing on 'AdS form factors' of one
bulk and two boundary insertions, we reformulate these locality constraints as
a complete set of sum rules on the BOE data. We show that these sum rules lead
to a manifestly local representation of form factors in terms of 'local
blocks'. The sum rules are valid non-perturbatively, but are especially
well-adapted for perturbative computations in AdS where they allow us to
bootstrap the BOE data in a systematic fashion. Finally, in the flat space
limit, we show that the AdS form factor reduces to an ordinary QFT form factor.
We provide a phase shift formula for it in terms of the BOE and CFT data. In
two dimensions, this formula makes manifest Watson's equations for integrable
form factors under certain extremality assumptions on the CFT. We discuss the
eventual modifications of our formalism to account for dressed operators in

the entries of a given dataset, prior to its public release, to protect against
leakage of private information. In this work, dataset obfuscation under two
objectives is considered: i) rank-preservation: to preserve the row ordering in
the obfuscated dataset induced by a given rank function, and ii) anonymity: to
protect user anonymity under fingerprinting attacks. The first objective,
rank-preservation, is of interest in applications such as the design of search
engines and recommendation systems, feature matching, and social network
analysis. Fingerprinting attacks, considered in evaluating the anonymity
objective, are privacy attacks where an attacker constructs a fingerprint of a
victim based on its observed activities, such as online web activities, and
compares this fingerprint with information extracted from a publicly released
obfuscated dataset to identify the victim. By evaluating the performance limits
of a class of obfuscation mechanisms over asymptotically large datasets, a
fundamental trade-off is quantified between rank-preservation and user
anonymity. Single-letter obfuscation mechanisms are considered, where each
entry in the dataset is perturbed by independent noise, and their fundamental
performance limits are characterized by leveraging large deviation techniques.
The optimal obfuscating test-channel, optimizing the privacy-utility tradeoff,
is characterized in the form of a convex optimization problem which can be
solved efficiently. Numerical simulations of various scenarios are provided to

close to the universal value of $\frac{\Omega_b}{\Omega_m}\approx 0.15$ in the

is still uncertain which hardware concept is most suited to execute the VQE for
e.g., the simulation of molecules. Aspects to consider here are the required
connectivity of the quantum circuit used, the size and the depth and thus the
susceptibility to noise effects. Besides theoretical considerations, empirical
studies using available quantum hardware may help to clarify the question of
which hardware technology might be better suited for a certain given
application and algorithm. Going one step into this direction, within this
work, we present results using the VQE for the simulation of the hydrogen

selected to reduce the amount of iterations required. The findings are analyzed
considering different quantum processor types, calibration data as well as the

the N-PDF shape was less correlated with the star-forming activity over a whole

enhance their performances on leaderboards. This phenomenon raises a question:
can machine generated rationales also be useful for humans, especially when lay
humans try to answer questions based on those machine rationales? We observe
that human utility of existing rationales is far from satisfactory, and
expensive to estimate with human studies. Existing metrics like task
performance of the LM generating the rationales, or similarity between

While we observe that certain properties of rationales like conciseness and
novelty are correlated with their human utility, estimating them without human

helpfulness in answering similar unseen instances, we can measure its human
utility to a better extent. We also translate this finding into an automated

Besides, understanding in depth the relationship between time-linkage effect

However, they often require setups that hardly mimic the biological

of forces that vary during the evaporation period. We delineate the role that
the composition of the aqueous environment and the nature of the substrate play
in pattern formation. We demonstrate that evaporating droplets may serve as
bioreactors that supports cellular processes and allows investigation on the
dynamics of membraneless compartments. Such a setup is an original tool for
biological structures to understand the mechanisms underlying the activity of

problem, where the task is to automatically recognise objects from subordinate

inter-class variances among visually similar classes. Recently, methods with
Vision Transformer (ViT) have demonstrated noticeable achievements in FGVC,
generally by employing the self-attention mechanism with additional
resource-consuming techniques to distinguish potentially discriminative regions
while disregarding the rest. However, such approaches may struggle to
effectively focus on truly discriminative regions due to only relying on the
inherent self-attention mechanism, resulting in the classification token likely
aggregating global information from less-important background patches.
Moreover, due to the immense lack of the datapoints, classifiers may fail to
find the most helpful inter-class distinguishing features, since other
unrelated but distinctive background regions may be falsely recognised as being
valuable. To this end, we introduce a simple yet effective Salient Mask-Guided
Vision Transformer (SM-ViT), where the discriminability of the standard ViT`s
attention maps is boosted through salient masking of potentially discriminative
foreground regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that with the standard
training procedure our SM-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular

phenomenon that can degrade the accuracy of the direction-of-arrival (DOA)
estimation. Presence of multipath leads to misspecification in the radar data
model, resulting in estimation performance degradation, which cannot be
reliably predicted by conventional performance bounds. In this paper, the
misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound (MCRB), which accounts for model
misspecification, is derived for the problem of DOA estimation in the presence
of multipath which is ignored by the estimator. Analytical relations between
the MCRB and the Cram\'er-Rao bound are established, and the DOA estimation
performance degradation due to multipath is investigated. The results show that
the MCRB reliably predicts the asymptotic performance of the misspecified
maximum-likelihood estimator and therefore, can serve as an efficient tool for
automotive radar performance evaluation and system design.

spin systems, in which magnetic ordering is prevented down to the lowest
temperatures due to quantum fluctuations. One of the most extraordinary
characteristics of QSL phases is their ability to support fractionalized,
low-energy quasiparticles known as spinons, which carry spin-1/2 but bear no
charge. Relaxometry based on color centers in crystalline materials -- of which
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a well-explored example --
provides an exciting new platform to probe the spin spectral functions of
magnetic materials with both energy and momentum resolution and to search for
signatures of these elusive, fractionalized excitations. In this work, we
theoretically investigate the color-center relaxometry of two archetypal QSLs:
the two-dimensional U(1) QSL with a spinon Fermi surface and the spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic spin chain. The former is characterized by a metallic,
spin-split ground state of mobile, interacting spinons, which closely resembles
a spin-polarized Fermi liquid ground state but with neutral quasiparticles. We
show that the observation of the Stoner continuum and the collective spin wave
mode in the spin spectral function would provide a strong evidence for the
existence of spinons and fractionalization. In one dimension, mobile spinons
form a Luttinger liquid ground state. We show that the spin spectral function
exhibits strong features representing the collective density and spin-wave
modes, which are broadened in an algebraic fashion with an exponent
characterized by the Luttinger parameter. The possibilities of measuring these
collective modes and detecting the power-law decay of the spectral weight using
NV relaxometry are discussed. We also examine how the transition rates are
modified by marginally irrelevant operators in the Heisenberg limit.

mitigating conflicts between xApp decisions requires further in-depth
investigation. This article defines a conflict mitigation framework (CMF) built
into the existing O-RAN architecture; it enables the Conflict Mitigation

we study commitment over unreliable continuous alphabet channels called the
Gaussian unfair noisy channels or Gaussian UNCs.
  We present the first results on the optimal throughput or commitment capacity
of Gaussian UNCs. It is known that classical Gaussian channels have infinite
commitment capacity, even under finite transmit power constraints. For
unreliable Gaussian UNCs, we prove the surprising result that their commitment
capacity may be finite, and in some cases, zero. When commitment is possible,
we present achievable rate lower bounds by constructing positive - throughput
protocols under given input power constraint, and (two-sided) channel
elasticity at committer Alice and receiver Bob. Our achievability results
establish an interesting fact - Gaussian UNCs with zero elasticity have
infinite commitment capacity - which brings a completely new perspective to why
classic Gaussian channels, i.e., Gaussian UNCs with zero elasticity, have
infinite capacity. Finally, we precisely characterize the positive commitment
capacity threshold for a Gaussian UNC in terms of the channel elasticity, when
the transmit power tends to infinity.

operations, the proposed GNN model has low computation complexity and achieves
comparable high accuracy. The GNN-based approach enables our proposed
\emph{input pruning} strategy. By filtering out the irrelevant vertices in the
input graph, we can reduce the computation complexity. Moreover, we propose the
\emph{model pruning} strategy to sparsify the model weight matrices which
further reduces the computation complexity. We evaluate the proposed GNN model
on the MSTAR dataset and ship discrimination dataset. The evaluation results
show that the proposed GNN model achieves 99.38\% and 99.7\% classification

semi-circular, gas-fluidized bed with side jets. In this work, the particles
are 1 mm ceramic beads. The bed is operated just at and slightly above and
below the minimum fluidization velocity and additional fluidization is provided
by two high-speed gas located on the sides of the bed near the flat, front face
of the unit. Two primary measurements are taken: high-speed video recording of
the front of the bed and bed pressure drop from a tap in the back of the bed.
PIV is used to determine particle motion, characterized as a mean Froude
number, from the high-speed video. A CFD-DEM model of the bed is presented
using the recently released MFIX-Exa code. Four model subvariants are
considered using two methods of representing the jets and two drag models, both
of which are calibrated to exactly match the experimentally measured minimum
fluidization velocity. Although it is more difficult to determine the jet
penetration depths in a straightforward manner as in the previous works using
Froude number contours, the CFD-DEM results compare quite well to the PIV
measurements. Unfortunately, the good agreement of the solids-phase is
overshadowed by significant disagreement in the gas-phase data. Specifically,
the predicted time-averaged standard deviation of the pressure drop is found to
be over an order of magnitude larger than measured. Due to the low value of the
measurements, just 1% of the mean bed pressure drop, it seems possible that the
data is in error. On the other hand, the model may not be accurately capturing
pressure attenuation through an under-fluidized region in the back of the bed.
Without the possibility additional experiments to test the validity of the
data, this work is simply being reported as is without being able to indicate
which, either the simulation or the experiment, is more correct.

dislocation-mediated kink bands, appearing due to strong plastic anisotropy,
and reversible twinning of martensite. For this combination of twinning and

The model is subsequently formulated using the tools of nonlinear elasticity

also a highly nontrivial task because large antenna arrays typically have a
limited number of radio-frequency chains, allowing only low-dimensional
measurements of the high-dimensional channel. This paper considers a two-sided
beam alignment problem based on an alternating ping-pong pilot scheme between
Tx and Rx over multiple rounds without explicit feedback. We propose a deep
active sensing framework in which two long short-term memory (LSTM) based

optical bistability in a resonantly pumped optical ring cavity interacting
strongly with a cloud of atoms via a narrow atomic transition. The bistability
emerges, above a critical pump rate, as an additional peak in the cavity's
normal mode spectrum close to atomic resonance. This third transmission peak is
usually suppressed due to strong resonant absorption, but in our experiment it
is visible because of the linewidth of the atomic transition being much smaller
than that of the cavity, which sets the experiment into the bad-cavity regime.
Relying on complete saturation of the transition, this bistability has a
quantum origin and cannot be mimicked by a classical material presenting a

However, very little is known about the statistical properties of this

preserve relevant information about a class label. To gain a theoretical
perspective on the supervised summarization problem itself, we first formulate
it in terms of maximizing the Shannon mutual information between the summarized

this problem, thereby constraining what one should expect from proposed

empirically show performance improvements over previous works in terms of
classification accuracy and time on synthetic and certain real datasets. We
also theoretically explore the limitations of the optimal transport approach

clouds (T < 20K) deuterium fractionation is driven by the H2D+ ion, whereas at
higher temperatures (T > 20-30K) gas-phase deuteration is controlled by
reactions with CH2D+ and C2HD+. While the role of H2D+ in driving cold
interstellar deuterium chemistry is well understood, thanks to observational
constraints from direct measurements of H2D+, deuteration stemming from CH2D+
is far less understood, caused by the absence of direct observational
constraints of its key ions. Therefore, making use of chemical surrogates is
imperative for exploring deuterium chemistry at intermediate temperatures.
Formed at an early stage of ion-molecule chemistry, directly from the
dissociative recombination of CH3+ (CH2D+), CH (CD) is an ideal tracer for
investigating deuterium substitution initiated by reactions with CH2D+. This

exploits the strict conservation of the magnetic moment to reduce the
dimensionality of velocity space. A new particle integrator is implemented,
which allows for particle substepping without the need to stop particle motion
at every cell for charge conservation. Particle suborbits are determined from
accuracy considerations, and are allowed to span multiple cells. Novel particle
injection and expansion-to-infinity boundary conditions are developed,
including a control loop to prevent the formation of spurious sheaths at the
edges of the domain. The algorithm is verified in a periodic magnetic mirror
configuration, a uniform plasma test case (to test particle injection), and a
propulsive magnetic nozzle. The algorithm's computational complexity is shown
to scale favorably with timestep, and linearly with the number of particles and
mesh cells (unlike earlier implicit PIC implementations, which scaled
quadratically with the number of mesh cells in one dimension). Numerical
experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms both explicit

providing safe, relaxing, and convenient ground transportation. The computing
systems in such vehicles are required to interpret various sensor data and
generate responses to the environment in a timely manner to ensure driving
safety. However, such timing-related safety requirements are largely unexplored
in prior works.
  In this paper, we conduct a systematic study to understand the timing
requirements of AV systems. We focus on investigating and mitigating the
sources of tail latency in Level-4 AV computing systems. We observe that the
performance of AV algorithms is not uniformly distributed -- instead, the
latency is susceptible to vehicle environment fluctuations, such as traffic
density. This contributes to burst computation and memory access in response to
the traffic, and further leads to tail latency in the system. Furthermore, we
observe that tail latency also comes from a mismatch between the pre-configured
AV computation pipeline and the dynamic latency requirements in real-world
driving scenarios.
  Based on these observations, we propose a set of system designs to mitigate
AV tail latency. We demonstrate our design on widely-used industrial Level-4 AV
systems, Baidu Apollo and Autoware. The evaluation shows that our design
achieves 1.65 X improvement over the worst-case latency and 1.3 X over the
average latency, and avoids 93% of accidents on Apollo.

Anthropic, have the stated goal of building artificial general intelligence
(AGI) - AI systems that achieve or exceed human performance across a wide range
of cognitive tasks. In pursuing this goal, they may develop and deploy AI
systems that pose particularly significant risks. While they have already taken
some measures to mitigate these risks, best practices have not yet emerged. To
support the identification of best practices, we sent a survey to 92 leading
experts from AGI labs, academia, and civil society and received 51 responses.
Participants were asked how much they agreed with 50 statements about what AGI
labs should do. Our main finding is that participants, on average, agreed with
all of them. Many statements received extremely high levels of agreement. For
example, 98% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed that AGI labs should
conduct pre-deployment risk assessments, dangerous capabilities evaluations,
third-party model audits, safety restrictions on model usage, and red teaming.
Ultimately, our list of statements may serve as a helpful foundation for
efforts to develop best practices, standards, and regulations for AGI labs.

actionable and persistent representation of the environment in real-time using
sensor data and prior knowledge. Despite the fast-paced progress in robot
perception, most existing methods either build purely geometric maps (as in
traditional SLAM) or flat metric-semantic maps that do not scale to large
environments or large dictionaries of semantic labels. The first part of this
paper is concerned with representations: we show that scalable representations
for spatial perception need to be hierarchical in nature. Hierarchical
representations are efficient to store, and lead to layered graphs with small
treewidth, which enable provably efficient inference. We then introduce an
example of hierarchical representation for indoor environments, namely a 3D
scene graph, and discuss its structure and properties. The second part of the
paper focuses on algorithms to incrementally construct a 3D scene graph as the
robot explores the environment. Our algorithms combine 3D geometry, topology
(to cluster the places into rooms), and geometric deep learning (e.g., to
classify the type of rooms the robot is moving across). The third part of the
paper focuses on algorithms to maintain and correct 3D scene graphs during
long-term operation. We propose hierarchical descriptors for loop closure
detection and describe how to correct a scene graph in response to loop
closures, by solving a 3D scene graph optimization problem. We conclude the
paper by combining the proposed perception algorithms into Hydra, a real-time
spatial perception system that builds a 3D scene graph from visual-inertial
data in real-time. We showcase Hydra's performance in photo-realistic
simulations and real data collected by a Clearpath Jackal robots and a Unitree
A1 robot. We release an open-source implementation of Hydra at

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the most impacting of these phenomena in
near-Earth space weather, and consist of plasma clouds, with magnetic field,
ejected from the solar corona. Precisely predicting the trajectory of CMEs is
crucial in determining whether a CME will hit a planet and impact its
magnetosphere and atmosphere. Despite the rapid developments in the search for
stellar CMEs, their detection is still very incipient. In this work we aim to
better understand the propagation of CMEs by analysing the influence of initial

magnetic field's configuration. We reconstruct magnetograms for Kepler-63 (KIC

general, deflections and rotations of CMEs decrease with their radial velocity,
and increase with ejection latitude. Moreover, magnetic fields stronger than

of which involves projecting ontologies into graph structures and applying
graph embeddings or graph-based machine learning methods to the resulting

graphs. However, these methods are limited in the type of axioms they can
project (totality), whether they are invertible (injectivity), and how they
exploit semantic information. These limitations restrict the kind of tasks to
which they can be applied. Category-theoretical semantics of logic languages
formalizes interpretations using categories instead of sets, and categories
have a graph-like structure. We developed CatE, which uses the
category-theoretical formulation of the semantics of the Description Logic

CatE projection is total and injective, and therefore overcomes limitations of
other graph-based ontology embedding methods which are generally not

are low spatial resolution and high radioactive dose to the patient, both of
which result from limitations in detection technology rather than fundamental
physics. A new type of TOF-PET detector employing low-atomic number (low-Z)
scintillation media and large-area, high-resolution photodetectors to record
Compton scattering locations in the detector has been proposed as a promising
alternative, but neither a direct comparison to state-of-the-art TOF-PET nor
the minimum technical requirements for such a system have yet been established.
Here we present a simulation study evaluating the potential of a proposed low-Z
detection medium, linear alkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a switchable molecular
recorder, for next-generation TOF-PET detection. We developed a custom Monte
Carlo simulation of full-body TOF-PET using the TOPAS Geant4 software package.
By quantifying contributions and tradeoffs for energy, spatial, and timing
resolution of the detector, we show that a reasonable combination of
specifications improves TOF-PET sensitivity by more than 5x, with comparable or
better spatial resolution and 40-50% enhanced contrast-to-noise as compared to
state-of-the-art scintillating crystal materials. These improvements enable
clear imaging of a brain phantom simulated at less than 1% of a standard
radiotracer dose, which could enable expanded access and new clinical
applications for TOF-PET.

fundamental significance to crystals. However, in the conventional framework,
every space group in real space, either symmorphic or nonsymmorphic,

framework by showing that in a 2D acoustic crystal with chess-board pattern of
$\pi$ and 0 fluxes, mirror reflections are manifested nonsymmorphically as
glide reflections in momentum space. These momentum-space nonsymmorphic
symmetries stem from projective, rather than ordinary, representations of the
real-space symmetries due to the peculiar flux pattern. Moreover, our
experiment demonstrates that the glide reflection can reduce the topological
type of the Brillouin zone from the torus to the Klein bottle, resulting in
novel topological phases with new topological invariants. Since crystalline
topologies are based on momentum-space symmetries, our work paves the way for
utilizing engineerable gauge fluxes over artificial crystals to extend the
current topological classifications into the broader regime of momentum-space
nonsymmorphic symmetries.

reports are usually similar to each other due to the common content of anatomy.
This makes a model hard to capture the uniqueness of individual images and is
prone to producing undesired generic or mismatched reports. This situation
calls for learning more discriminative features that could capture even
fine-grained mismatches between images and reports. To achieve this, this paper
proposes a novel framework to learn discriminative image and report features by
distinguishing them from their closest peers, i.e., hard negatives. Especially,
to attain more discriminative features, we gradually raise the difficulty of
such a learning task by creating increasingly hard negative reports for each
image in the feature space during training, respectively. By treating the
increasingly hard negatives as auxiliary variables, we formulate this process
as a min-max alternating optimisation problem. At each iteration, conditioned
on a given set of hard negative reports, image and report features are learned
as usual by minimising the loss functions related to report generation. After
that, a new set of harder negative reports will be created by maximising a loss
reflecting image-report alignment. By solving this optimisation, we attain a
model that can generate more specific and accurate reports. It is noteworthy
that our framework enhances discriminative feature learning without introducing
extra network weights. Also, in contrast to the existing way of generating hard
negatives, our framework extends beyond the granularity of the dataset by
generating harder samples out of the training set. Experimental study on
benchmark datasets verifies the efficacy of our framework and shows that it can
serve as a plug-in to readily improve existing medical report generation
models.

conforming loan securitization rules that create incentives that foster both
moral hazard and adverse selection effects. The climate risks bundled into GSE
mortgage-backed securities emerge because of the complex securitization chain

challenging research topic in computer vision. Existing literature focus on
addressing this challenge through global-based or local-based representation

local relationships with complex structures, possibly leading to high model
complexity. To address the above challenges, this article proposes a novel
framework called SGML-Net for few-shot fine-grained visual recognition.
SGML-Net incorporates auxiliary information via saliency detection to guide
discriminative representation learning, achieving high performance and low
model complexity. Specifically, SGML-Net utilizes the saliency detection model
to emphasize the key regions of each sub-category, providing a strong prior for
representation learning. SGML-Net transfers such prior with two independent
branches in a mutual learning paradigm. To achieve effective transfer, SGML-Net
leverages the relationships among different regions, making the representation
more informative and thus providing better guidance. The auxiliary branch is
excluded upon the transfer's completion, ensuring low model complexity in
deployment. The proposed approach is empirically evaluated on three widely-used
benchmarks, demonstrating its superior performance.

conservative simultaneous approximation terms (SATs). We show that the scheme
is high-order accurate and entropy conservative on periodic curvilinear

artificial dissipation operator is constructed, which can be added to the SATs
to obtain an entropy stable semi-discretization. Fully-discrete entropy

viscous SATs, applicable to both the Hadamard-form and entropy-split schemes,
are developed for the Navier-Stokes equations. In the absence of heat fluxes,
the entropy-split scheme is entropy stable for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Local conservation in the vicinity of discontinuities is enforced using an

backreaction of heavy point particles. These wormholes help describe a rich
formalism to coarse grain pure states in 2d CFTs dual to the black hole
geometries because the wormhole amplitudes match with the Renyi entropies of
CFT states obtained by decohering the pure states in a specific way. This
formalism can be generalised to coarse grain pure states in several copies of
the dual CFT dual to multi-boundary black holes using wormhole solutions with
higher genus boundaries using which we illustrate that coarse graining away the
interior of multi-boundary black holes sets the mutual information between any
two copies of the dual CFT to zero. Furthermore, this formalism of coarse
graining pure states can be extended to decohere transition matrices between
pure states which helps interpret more general families of wormhole solutions
including those with non replica-symmetric boundary conditions in individual
CFTs. The pseudo entropy of the decohered transition matrices has interesting
holographic interpretation in terms of the area of minimal surfaces on
appropriate black hole or wormhole geometries. The wormhole solutions which

Specifically, we first propose a joint channel and location sensing scheme,

orthogonal matching pursuit (LA-GMMV-OMP) algorithm for channel estimation (CE)
and a complete dictionary based localization (CDL) scheme, where a frequency
selective polar-domain redundant dictionary is proposed to overcome the hybrid

(respectively observed from the BS and RIS) to the localization module, which
returns the fine off-grid angle estimation to improve CE. Particularly, with
RIS, CDL can obtain user's location via line intersection, and a polar-domain
gradient descent (PGD) algorithm at the base station is proposed to achieve the
off-grid angle estimation with super-resolution accuracy. Additionally, to
further reduce the sensing overhead, we propose a partial dictionary-based
localization scheme, which is decoupled from CE, where RIS is served as an
anchor to lock the user on the hyperbola according to time difference of

studies a novel problem motivated by an example of district heating and cooling

In steam-based networks, storage tanks are usually absent, and there is a
strong need to utilize thermal inertia of the pipeline network as storage.
However, this type of use of a heating network directly affects the operating

developments in techniques for separating target-bound Dynabeads from unbound
Dynabeads makes such an implementation feasible. We deploy Dynabeads
anti-Salmonella to bind and identify Salmonella enterica, a major foodborne

  Voice Conversion","Submitted to TASLP",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) converts source speech into the voice of any
desired speaker using only one utterance of the speaker without requiring
additional model updates. Typical methods use a speaker representation from a
pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation
during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling
methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and
frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling
hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who
are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot
VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC.
Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic
in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained
speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out
when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves
variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel
dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by
the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module
stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from
multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement
and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate
zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three
aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process.
Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC
methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.

proposes MEM-REC, a novel alternative representation approach for embedding
tables. MEM-REC leverages bloom filters and hashing methods to encode
categorical features using two cache-friendly embedding tables. The first table
(token embedding) contains raw embeddings (i.e. learned vector representation),
and the second table (weight embedding), which is much smaller, contains
weights to scale these raw embeddings to provide better discriminative

MEM-REC can not only maintain the recommendation quality and significantly
reduce the memory footprint for commercial scale recommendation models but can
also improve the embedding latency. In particular, based on our results,
MEM-REC compresses the MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM model size by 2900x and
performs up to 3.4x faster embeddings while achieving the same AUC as that of

resources in their infrastructure and have enabled users to design and deploy
their own accelerators on these FPGAs. Multi-tenancy FPGAs, where multiple

raises security concerns. Various types of side-channel attacks targeting
multi-tenancy FPGAs have been proposed and validated. The awareness of security
vulnerabilities in the cloud has motivated cloud providers to take action to
enhance the security of their cloud environments.
  In FPGA security research papers, researchers always perform attacks under

proves that attackers can use our method to perform cloud FPGA accelerator

Evaluation results show that the linear optimization model preserves privacy

estimation. Specifically, we construct distance matrix between data points by
Butterworth filter such that distance between any two data points in the same
clusters equals to a small constant, while increasing the distance between
other data pairs from different clusters. To well exploit the complementary
information embedded in different views, we leverage the tensor Schatten p-norm
regularization on the 3rd-order tensor which consists of indicator matrices of
different views. Finally, an efficient alternating algorithm is derived to
optimize our model. The constructed sequence was proved to converge to the
stationary KKT point. Extensive experimental results indicate the superiority
of our proposed method.

completely missing. We thoroughly investigate MMG in the context of standard
supervised action recognition and the more challenging few-shot setting for
learning new action categories. MMG consists of two novel scenarios, designed
to support security, and efficiency considerations in real-world applications:
(1) missing modality generalization where some modalities that were present
during the train time are missing during the inference time, and (2)
cross-modal zero-shot generalization, where the modalities present during the
inference time and the training time are disjoint. To enable this
investigation, we construct a new dataset MMG-Ego4D containing data points with
video, audio, and inertial motion sensor (IMU) modalities. Our dataset is
derived from Ego4D dataset, but processed and thoroughly re-annotated by human
experts to facilitate research in the MMG problem. We evaluate a diverse array
of models on MMG-Ego4D and propose new methods with improved generalization
ability. In particular, we introduce a new fusion module with modality dropout
training, contrastive-based alignment training, and a novel cross-modal
prototypical loss for better few-shot performance. We hope this study will
serve as a benchmark and guide future research in multimodal generalization

based on the lack of information about scattering phaseshifts in the part of
the wavefunction (satisfying the ingoing-wave boundary condition) going to the
detector. This article aims to test this claim by examining a photodetachment
process in a simple 1D model with a short-range symmetrical potential. Using
time-dependent perturbation theory with a dipole interaction, the relevant
wavepacket of the outgoing particle is analyzed and compared to the free
wavepacket as a reference. Our findings confirm that, indeed, a time delay
arises in the liberated fragmentation wavepacket, which is expressed as an
energy derivative of the scattering phaseshift. Our study highlights that the
source of the phaseshift content in the wavepacket arriving at the detector is
the dipole matrix element, which is a direct consequence of imposing the
ingoing-wave boundary condition. We illustrate our results through numerical
simulations of both the non-free and free wavepackets. The amount of the

interpretation is challenging as ESC is extremely vulnerable to physical-layer
adversarial attacks due to the openness of wireless channels and the
fragileness of neural models. Toward ESC robustness in practice, we ask the
following two questions: Q1: For attacks, is it possible to generate
semantic-oriented physical-layer adversarial attacks that are imperceptible,
input-agnostic and controllable? Q2: Can we develop a defense strategy against
such semantic distortions and previously proposed adversaries? To this end, we
first present MobileSC, a novel semantic communication framework that considers
the computation and memory efficiency in wireless environments. Equipped with
this framework, we propose SemAdv, a physical-layer adversarial perturbation
generator that aims to craft semantic adversaries over the air with the
abovementioned criteria, thus answering the Q1. To better characterize the
realworld effects for robust training and evaluation, we further introduce a
novel adversarial training method SemMixed to harden the ESC against SemAdv

experiments on three public benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed
methods against various physical adversarial attacks. We also show some
interesting findings, e.g., our MobileSC can even be more robust than classical

polarization and with strong Kondo-coherence-like temperature-dependent
spectral weight variation suggestive of strong Hund's metal correlations. In

high degree of information density, as sounds produced by multiple objects are
entangled within the same audio stream; (2) the frequency of audio signals from
objects with the same category tends to be similar, which hampers the
distinction of target object and consequently leads to ambiguous segmentation
results. Toward this end, we propose an Audio Unmixing and Semantic
Segmentation Network (AUSS), which encourages unmixing complicated audio
signals and distinguishing similar sounds. Technically, our AUSS unmixs the
audio signals into a set of audio queries, and interacts them with visual
features by masked attention mechanisms. To encourage these audio queries to
capture distinctive features embedded within the audio, two self-supervised
losses are also introduced as additional supervision at both class and mask
levels. Extensive experimental results on the AVSBench benchmark show that our
AUSS sets a new state-of-the-art in both single-source and multi-source

reasoning with widespread applications across a number of disciplines. A
standard forgetting operator, characterized in [Lin and Reiter'94] in terms of
model-theoretic semantics and primarily focusing on the propositional case,
opened up a new research subarea. In this paper, a new operator called weak
forgetting, dual to standard forgetting, is introduced and both together are
shown to offer a new more uniform perspective on forgetting operators in
general. Both the weak and standard forgetting operators are characterized in
terms of entailment and inference, rather than a model theoretic semantics.
This naturally leads to a useful algorithmic perspective based on quantifier
elimination and the use of Ackermman's Lemma and its fixpoint generalization.
The strong formal relationship between standard forgetting and strongest
necessary conditions and weak forgetting and weakest sufficient conditions is
also characterized quite naturally through the entailment-based, inferential
perspective used. The framework used to characterize the dual forgetting
operators is also generalized to the first-order case and includes useful
algorithms for computing first-order forgetting operators in special cases.
Practical examples are also included to show the importance of both weak and
standard forgetting in modeling and representation.

  Applications",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ultra-high-resolution target sensing has emerged as a key enabler for various
cutting-edge applications, which can be realized by utilizing the millimeter
wave/terahertz frequencies. However, the extremely high operating frequency
inevitably leads to significant Doppler shift effects, especially for
high-mobility applications, causing the degradation of sensing performance with
high false alarm rate. To this end, this paper proposes a parameter design
methodology of the well-known constant amplitude zero auto correlation (CAZAC)
sequences, which aims at enhancing their resilience to Doppler shifts.
Specifically, we suppress the sidelobes incurred by Doppler shifts for the
peak-to-sidelobe ratio (PSLR) improvement within the range of interest (RoI) of
the radar range profile. The Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence, as a representative
member in the CAZAC family, is firstly considered. The impacts of its root
index on range sidelobes are investigated based on number theory. For an
arbitrary-length ZC sequence, a feasible range of the root index is derived to
satisfy the requirement of PSLR within the scope of RoI. Furthermore, these
design guidelines are extended to a general form of CAZAC sequences, where a
low-complexity heuristic algorithm is developed for PSLR improvement.
Simulation results demonstrate that under severe Doppler shifts, our proposed
methodology could enhance the sensing performance by lowering the false alarm
rate while maintaining the same detection rate, compared with its classical
counterpart.

be a powerful approach to challenge well-established performance limits, for
example bounds on absorption and impedance matching. So far, the majority of
these studies have concentrated on time-switched systems, where the material
undergoes instantaneous modulation in time while the input field is entirely
contained within it. This approach, however, necessitates accurate timing of
the switching event and limits how thin the system can ultimately be due to the
spatial width of the impinging pulse. To address these challenges, here we
investigate the periodic temporal modulation of highly lossy materials,
focusing on their relatively unexplored parametric absorption aspects. Our
results reveal that, by appropriately selecting the modulation parameters, the
absorption performance of a periodically modulated absorber can be greatly
improved compared to its time-invariant counterpart, and can even exceed the
theoretical bound for conventional electromagnetic absorbers, namely, the
""Rozanov bound"". Our findings thus demonstrate the potential of periodic
temporal modulations to enable significant improvements in absorber performance
while circumventing the limitations imposed by precise timing and material
thickness in time-switched schemes, opening up new opportunities for the design
and optimization of advanced electromagnetic absorber systems for various
applications.

requirements while simultaneously improving efficiency and sustainability by
accommodating several trip requests within a single ride. However, quantifying
the advantages and disadvantages of dynamic ride-sharing, particularly
high-capacity ride-sharing, remains a challenge due to the complex dynamics
that depend on several factors, including matching algorithms, vehicle
capacity, transportation network topology, and spatiotemporal demand and supply
distribution. In this study, we conduct extensive experiments on an agent-based
simulation platform calibrated by real-world mobility data from Chengdu, Hong
Kong, and Manhattan. Our findings reveal a few scaling laws that can
effectively measure how key performance metrics such as passenger service rate
and vehicle occupancy rate change with a dimensionless system loading factor
that reflects the relative magnitude of demand versus supply. Moreover, our
results indicate that these scaling laws are universal for different network
topologies and supply-demand situations. As a result, these scaling laws offer
a means for urban planners, city managers, and ride-hailing platforms to
quantify the potential benefits and drawbacks of dynamic ride-sharing under
different circumstances and to design better operational and regulatory

transformer, has shown significant performance on natural language processing

  and sampling frequencies -- A general framework","6 figures",,,,"physics.optics physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optical tweezers (OT) have become an essential technique in several fields of
physics, chemistry, and biology as precise micromanipulation tools and
microscopic force transducers. Quantitative measurements require the accurate
calibration of the trap stiffness of the optical trap and the diffusion
constant of the optically trapped particle. This is typically done by
statistical estimators constructed from the position signal of the particle,
which is recorded by a digital camera or a quadrant photodiode. The finite
integration time and sampling frequency of the detector need to be properly
taken into account. Here, we present a general approach based on the joint
probability density function of the sampled trajectory that corrects exactly
the biases due to the detector's finite integration time and limited sampling
frequency, providing theoretical formulas for the most widely employed
calibration methods: equipartition, mean squared displacement, autocorrelation,
power spectral density, and force reconstruction via
maximum-likelihood-estimator analysis (FORMA). Our results, tested with
experiments and Monte Carlo simulations, will permit users of OT to confidently
estimate the trap stiffness and diffusion constant, extending their use to a
broader set of experimental conditions.

function (PUF) are vulnerable to modeling attacks and other security threats.
This paper proposes an arbiter PUF based on a linear feedback shift register
(LFSR-APUF). Different from the previously reported linear feedback shift
register for challenge extension, the proposed scheme feeds the external random
challenges into the LFSR module to obfuscate the linear mapping relationship
between the challenge and response. It can prevent attackers from obtaining
valid challenge-response pairs (CRPs), increasing its resistance to modeling
attacks significantly. A 64-stage LFSR-APUF has been implemented on a field
programmable gate array (FPGA) board. The experimental results reveal that the
proposed design can effectively resist various modeling attacks such as
logistic regression (LR), evolutionary strategy (ES), Artificial Neuro Network
(ANN), and support vector machine (SVM) with a prediction rate of 51.79% and a
slight effect on the randomness, reliability, and uniqueness. Further, a
lightweight authentication protocol is established based on the proposed
LFSR-APUF. The protocol incorporates a low-overhead, ultra-lightweight, novel
private bit conversion Cover function that is uniquely bound to each device in
the authentication network. A dynamic and timevariant obfuscation scheme in
combination with the proposed LFSR-APUF is implemented in the protocol. The
proposed authentication protocol not only resists spoofing attacks, physical
attacks, and modeling attacks effectively, but also ensures the security of the
entire authentication network by transferring important information in
encrypted form from the server to the database even when the attacker
completely controls the server.

equation (mKdV) under the periodic boundary condition. The fifth-order mKdV is
an asymptotic model for shallow surface waves, and (in the perspective of
integrable systems) the second equation in the mKdV hierarchy as well. In
strong contrast with the non-periodic case, periodic solutions for dispersive
equations do not have a (local) smoothing effect, and this observation becomes
a major obstacle to considering the Cauchy problem for dispersive equations
under the periodic condition, consequently, the periodic fifth-order mKdV shows
a quasilinear phenomenon, while the non-periodic case can be considered as a
semilinear equation.
  In this paper, we mainly establish the global well-posedness of the
fifth-order mKdV in the energy space ($H^2(\mathbb T)$), which is an
improvement of the former result by the first author (2018). The main idea to
overcome the lack of (local) smoothing effect is to introduce a suitable
(frequency dependent) short-time space originally motivated by the work by
Ionescu, Kenig, and Tataru (2008). The new idea is to combine the (frequency)
localized modified energy with additional weight in the spaces, which
eventually handles the logarithmic divergence appearing in the energy

visual and depth representations to explore valuable query points on objects,
and the quality of the learned query points has a great impact on detection
accuracy. Unfortunately, existing unsupervised attention mechanisms in
transformers are prone to generate low-quality query features due to inaccurate
receptive fields, especially on hard objects. To tackle this problem, this
paper proposes a novel Supervised Scale-aware Deformable Attention (SSDA) for
monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, SSDA presets several masks with
different scales and utilizes depth and visual features to adaptively learn a
scale-aware filter for object query augmentation. Imposing the scale awareness,
SSDA could well predict the accurate receptive field of an object query to
support robust query feature generation. Aside from this, SSDA is assigned with
a Weighted Scale Matching (WSM) loss to supervise scale prediction, which
presents more confident results as compared to the unsupervised attention
mechanisms. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that SSDA
significantly improves the detection accuracy, especially on moderate and hard
objects, yielding state-of-the-art performance as compared to the existing
approaches. Our code will be made publicly available at

developing novel and accurate methods for multi-scale object tracking. The
Anti-UAV dataset used for the Anti-UAV Challenge has been publicly released.
There are two main differences between this year's competition and the previous
two. First, we have expanded the existing dataset, and for the first time,
released a training set so that participants can focus on improving their
models. Second, we set up two tracks for the first time, i.e., Anti-UAV
Tracking and Anti-UAV Detection & Tracking. Around 76 participating teams from
the globe competed in the 3rd Anti-UAV Challenge. In this paper, we provide a
brief summary of the 3rd Anti-UAV Workshop & Challenge including brief
introductions to the top three methods in each track. The submission
leaderboard will be reopened for researchers that are interested in the
Anti-UAV challenge. The benchmark dataset and other information can be found

Neutrino Observatory will be a 51 kton detector made up of 151 layers of 56 mm
thick soft iron with 40 mm air gap in between where the RPCs, the active
detectors, will be placed. The main goal of ICAL is to make precision
measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters using the atmospheric
neutrinos as source. The charged current interactions of the atmospheric muon
neutrinos and anti-neutrinos in the detector produce charged muons. The
magnetic field, with a maximum value of $\sim$ 1.5 T in the central region of
ICAL, is a critical component since it will be used to distinguish the charges
and determine the momentum and direction of these muons. It is difficult to
measure the magnetic field inside the iron. The existing methods can only
estimate the internal field and hence will be prone to error. This paper
presents the first simulations study of the effect of errors in the measurement
of the magnetic field in ICAL on its physics potential, especially the neutrino
mass ordering and precision measurement of oscillation parameters in the 2--3
sector. The study is a GEANT4-based analysis, using measurements of the
magnetic field at the prototype ICAL detector. We find that there is only a
small effect on the determination of the mass ordering. While local
fluctuations in the magnetic field measurement are well-tolerated, calibration
errors must remain well within 5\% to retain good precision determination of
the parameters $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m^2_{32}$.

arbitrarily varying channel where the legitimate parties are unaware of whether
or not an adversary is present. When there is no adversary, the channel state
always takes a default value $s_0$. When the adversary is present, they may
choose the channel state sequence based on a non-causal noisy view of the
transmitted codewords and the encoding and decoding scheme. We require that the
decoder output the correct message with a high probability when there is no
adversary, and either output the correct message or reject the transmission
when the adversary is present. Further, we allow the transmitter to employ
private randomness during encoding that is known neither to the receiver nor
the adversary. Our first result proves a dichotomy property for the capacity
for this problem -- the capacity either equals zero or it equals the
non-adversarial capacity of the channel. Next, we give a sufficient condition
for the capacity for this problem to be positive even when the non-adversarial
channel to the receiver is stochastically degraded with respect to the channel
to the adversary. Our proofs rely on a connection to a standalone
authentication problem, where the goal is to accept or reject a candidate
message that is already available to the decoder. Finally, we give examples and

in the power grid. Accurate probabilistic intraday forecasts of solar resources
are essential to increase the share of photovoltaic (PV) energy in the grid and
enable cost-efficient balancing of power demand and supply. Solar PV production
mainly depends on downwelling surface solar radiation (SSR). By estimating SSR
from geostationary satellites, we can cover large areas with high spatial and
temporal resolutions, allowing us to track cloud motion. State-of-the-art
probabilistic forecasts of solar resources from satellite imagery account only
for the advective motion of clouds. They do not consider the evolution of
clouds over time, their growth, and dissipation, even though these are major
sources of forecast uncertainty. To address the uncertainty of cloudiness
evolution, we present SolarSTEPS, the first optical-flow probabilistic model
able to simulate the temporal variability of cloudiness. We demonstrate that
forecasting the autocorrelated scale-dependent evolution of cloudiness
outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic advection-based forecasts by 9% in
continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). This corresponds to an extension of
the forecast lead time by about 45 minutes at constant CRPS. Our work is
motivated by the scale-dependent predictability of cloud growth and decay. We
demonstrate that cloudiness is more variable in time at smaller spatial scales
than at larger ones. Specifically, the temporal autocorrelation of cloudiness
is related to its spatial scale by a rational function. We also demonstrate
that decomposing cloudiness into multiple spatial scales in the forecasts
further improves the forecast skill, reducing the CRPS by 10% and the RMSE by
9%.

recently, Lindoy et al. reported the first instance of a sharp resonant effect

comprehensive object SLAM framework that focuses on object-based perception and

parametric and nonparametric statistic testing. In addition, we suggest an

consideration the semantic invariance of objects, we convert the object map to
a topological map to provide semantic descriptors to enable multi-map matching.
Finally, we suggest an object-driven active exploration strategy to achieve
autonomous mapping in the grasping scenario. A range of public datasets and
real-world results in mapping, augmented reality, scene matching,

  Definitions",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural-based word embeddings using solely distributional information have
consistently produced useful meaning representations for downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often result in representations that are hard to
interpret and control. Natural language definitions, on the other side, possess
a recursive, self-explanatory semantic structure that can support novel
representation learning paradigms able to preserve explicit conceptual
relations and constraints in the vector space.
  This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic, multi-relational framework to learn
word embeddings exclusively from natural language definitions by jointly
mapping defined and defining terms along with their corresponding semantic
relations. By automatically extracting the relations from definitions corpora
and formalising the learning problem via a translational objective, we
specialise the framework in hyperbolic space to capture the hierarchical and
multi-resolution structure induced by the definitions. An extensive empirical
analysis demonstrates that the framework can help impose the desired structural
constraints while preserving the mapping required for controllable and
interpretable semantic navigation. Moreover, the experiments reveal the
superiority of the hyperbolic word embeddings over the euclidean counterparts
and demonstrate that the multi-relational framework can obtain competitive
results when compared to state-of-the-art neural approaches (including
Transformers), with the advantage of being significantly more efficient and

transferring visual-language models for class-agnostic object counting.
Specifically, we propose CLIP-Count, a novel pipeline that estimates density

without requiring any finetuning on specific object classes. To align the text
embedding with dense image features, we introduce a patch-text contrastive loss
that guides the model to learn informative patch-level image representations

module that propagates semantic information across different resolution levels
of image features. Benefiting from the full exploitation of the rich image-text

effectively generates high-quality density maps for objects-of-interest.

we reduce the number of robustness evaluations by the correlation analysis,
which can incorporate similar evaluations and decrease the evaluation cost.

low-fidelity data, the online high-fidelity data is utilized to finetune the

probabilistic, in the form of probability distributions over the range of
possible outcomes. Such forecasts can be evaluated using proper scoring rules.
Proper scoring rules condense forecast performance into a single numerical
value, allowing competing forecasters to be ranked and compared. To facilitate
the use of scoring rules in practical applications, the scoringRules package in
R provides popular scoring rules for a wide range of forecast distributions.
This paper discusses an extension to the scoringRules package that additionally
permits the implementation of popular weighted scoring rules. Weighted scoring
rules allow particular outcomes to be targeted during forecast evaluation,
recognising that certain outcomes are often of more interest than others when
assessing forecast quality. This introduces the potential for very flexible,
user-oriented evaluation of probabilistic forecasts. We discuss the theory
underlying weighted scoring rules, and describe how they can readily be
implemented in practice using scoringRules. Functionality is available for
weighted versions of several popular scoring rules, including the logarithmic
score, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), and the energy score.
Two case studies are presented to demonstrate this, whereby weighted scoring
rules are applied to univariate and multivariate probabilistic forecasts in the
fields of meteorology and economics.

membrane at the periphery of mammalian cells. It is a major regulator of cell
shape through the generation of active cortical tension. In addition, the
cortex constitutes a mechanical shield that protects the cell during mechanical
agitation. Cortical mechanics is tightly controlled by the presence of actin
cross-linking proteins, that dynamically bind and unbind actin filaments.
Cross-linker actin bonds are weak non-covalent bonds whose bond lifetime is
likely affected by mechanical tension in the actin cortex making cortical
composition inherently mechanosensitive. Here, we present a quantitative study
of changes in cortex composition and turnover dynamics upon short-lived peaks
in active and passive mechanical tension in mitotic HeLa cells. Our findings
disclose a twofold mechanical reinforcement strategy of the cortex upon tension
peaks entailing i) a direct catch-bond mechanosensitivity of cross-linkers
filamin and $\alpha$-actinin and ii) an indirect cortical mechanosensitivity
that triggers actin cortex reinforcement via enhanced polymerization of actin.
We thereby disclose a `molecular safety belt' mechanism that protects the
cortex from injury upon mechanical challenges.

  criteria: application to radiological characterisation",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In decommissioning projects of nuclear facilities, the radiological
characterisation step aims to estimate the quantity and spatial distribution of
different radionuclides. To carry out the estimation, measurements are
performed on site to obtain preliminary information. The usual industrial
practice consists in applying spatial interpolation tools (as the ordinary
kriging method) on these data to predict the value of interest for the
contamination (radionuclide concentration, radioactivity, etc.) at unobserved
positions. This paper questions the ordinary kriging tool on the well-known
problem of the overoptimistic prediction variances due to not taking into
account uncertainties on the estimation of the kriging parameters (variance and
range). To overcome this issue, the practical use of the Bayesian kriging
method, where the model parameters are considered as random variables, is
deepened. The usefulness of Bayesian kriging, whilst comparing its performance
to that of ordinary kriging, is demonstrated in the small data context (which
is often the case in decommissioning projects). This result is obtained via
several numerical tests on different toy models, and using complementary
validation criteria: the predictivity coefficient (Q${}^2$), the Predictive
Variance Adequacy (PVA), the $\alpha$-Confidence Interval plot (and its
associated Mean Squared Error alpha (MSEalpha)), and the Predictive Interval
Adequacy (PIA). The latter is a new criterion adapted to the Bayesian kriging
results. Finally, the same comparison is performed on a real dataset coming
from the decommissioning project of the CEA Marcoule G3 reactor. It illustrates
the practical interest of Bayesian kriging in industrial radiological
characterisation.

generalizes the classic $k$-Median, $k$-Means, and $k$-Center problems. Given a
constant $z\ge 1$, the input to Robust $(k, z)$-Clustering is a set $P$ of $n$
weighted points in a metric space $(M,\delta)$ and a positive integer $k$.
Further, each point belongs to one (or more) of the $m$ many different groups
$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_m$. Our goal is to find a set $X$ of $k$ centers such that
$\max_{i \in [m]} \sum_{p \in S_i} w(p) \delta(p,X)^z$ is minimized.
  This problem arises in the domains of robust optimization [Anthony, Goyal,
Gupta, Nagarajan, Math. Oper. Res. 2010] and in algorithmic fairness. For
polynomial time computation, an approximation factor of $O(\log m/\log\log m)$
is known [Makarychev, Vakilian, COLT $2021$], which is tight under a plausible
complexity assumption even in the line metrics. For FPT time, there is a
$(3^z+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, which is tight under GAP-ETH [Goyal,
Jaiswal, Inf. Proc. Letters, 2023].
  Motivated by the tight lower bounds for general discrete metrics, we focus on
\emph{geometric} spaces such as the (discrete) high-dimensional Euclidean
setting and metrics of low doubling dimension, which play an important role in
data analysis applications. First, for a universal constant $\eta_0 >0.0006$,
we devise a $3^z(1-\eta_{0})$-factor FPT approximation algorithm for discrete
high-dimensional Euclidean spaces thereby bypassing the lower bound for general
metrics. We complement this result by showing that even the special case of
$k$-Center in dimension $\Theta(\log n)$ is $(\sqrt{3/2}- o(1))$-hard to
approximate for FPT algorithms. Finally, we complete the FPT approximation
landscape by designing an FPT $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation scheme (EPAS) for
the metric of sub-logarithmic doubling dimension.

the literature and the evidence on this is mixed. Some studies find that

Moreover, the welfare and distributional impacts of pricing have largely been
studied in the context of passenger travel whereas freight has received
relatively less attention. In this paper, we examine the impacts of several
third-best congestion pricing schemes on both passenger transport and freight
in an integrated manner using a large-scale microsimulator (SimMobility) that
explicitly simulates the behavioral decisions of the entire population of
individuals and business establishments, dynamic multimodal network
performance, and their interactions. Through simulations of a prototypical
North American city, we find that a distance-based pricing scheme yields the
largest welfare gains, although the gains are a modest fraction of toll
revenues (around 30\%). In the absence of revenue recycling or redistribution,
distance-based and cordon-based schemes are found to be particularly
regressive. On average, lower income individuals lose as a result of the
scheme, whereas higher income individuals gain. A similar trend is observed in
the context of shippers -- small establishments having lower shipment values
lose on average whereas larger establishments with higher shipment values gain.
We perform a detailed spatial analysis of distributional outcomes, and examine
the impacts on network performance, activity generation, mode and departure

applications. In particular, the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is the basis
of some of the most popular self-indexes for genomic data, due to its known
favourable behaviour on repetitive data.
  Some tools that exploit the intrinsic repetitiveness of biological data have
risen in popularity, due to their speed and low space consumption. We introduce
a new algorithm for computing the BWT, which takes advantage of the redundancy
of the data through a compressed version of matching statistics, the
$\textit{CMS}$ of [Lipt\'ak et al., WABI 2022]. We show that it suffices to
sort a small subset of suffixes, lowering both computation time and space. Our
result is due to a new insight which links the so-called insert-heads of
[Lipt\'ak et al., WABI 2022] to the well-known run boundaries of the BWT.
  We give two implementations of our algorithm, called
$\texttt{CMS}$-$\texttt{BWT}$, both competitive in our experimental validation
on highly repetitive real-life datasets. In most cases, they outperform other
tools w.r.t. running time, trading off a higher memory footprint, which,
however, is still considerably smaller than the total size of the input data.

using this technology to solve optimisation problems do not have an easily
accessible source of information on the current capabilities of quantum
computers and algorithms. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview
of the theory of quantum optimisation techniques and their practical
application, focusing on their near-term potential for noisy intermediate scale
quantum devices. Two main paradigms for quantum hardware are then discussed:
quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing. While quantum annealers are
effective for some optimisation problems, they have limitations and cannot be
used for universal quantum computation. In contrast, gate-based quantum
computers offer the potential for universal quantum computation, but they face
challenges with hardware limitations and accurate gate implementation. The

exterior and through the reorganisation of penguins as they seek to regulate
their heat production within the huddle. These two heat transfer mechanisms,
along with area, or penguin number, conservation, gives a free boundary problem
whose dynamics depend on both the dynamics interior and exterior to the huddle.
Assuming the huddle shape evolves slowly compared to the advective timescale of
the exterior wind, the interior temperature is governed by a Poisson equation
and the exterior temperature by the steady advection-diffusion equation. The
exterior, advective wind velocity is the gradient of a harmonic, scalar field.
The conformal invariance of the exterior governing equations is used to convert
the system to a Polubarinova-Galin type equation, with forcing depending on
both the interior and exterior temperature gradients at the huddle boundary.
The interior Poisson equation is not conformally invariant, so the interior
temperature gradient is found numerically using a combined adaptive
Antoulas-Anderson and least squares algorithm. The results show that,
irrespective of the starting shape, penguin huddles evolve into an egg-like
steady shape. This shape is dependent on the wind strength, parameterised by
the P\'eclet number Pe, and a parameter \b{eta} which effectively measures the
strength of the interior self-generation of heat by the penguins. The numerical
method developed is applicable to a further five free boundary problems.

applications in industrial surveillance, security system, and traffic control.
Unlike previous unsupervised VAD methods that adopt a fixed structure to learn
normality without considering different detection demands, we design a
spatial-temporal hierarchical architecture (STHA) as a configurable
architecture to flexibly detect different degrees of anomaly. The comprehensive
structure of the STHA is delineated into a tripartite hierarchy, encompassing
the following tiers: the stream level, the stack level, and the block level.
Specifically, we design several auto-encoder-based blocks that possess varying
capacities for extracting normal patterns. Then, we stack blocks according to
the complexity degrees with both intra-stack and inter-stack residual links to
learn hierarchical normality gradually. Considering the multisource knowledge
of videos, we also model the spatial normality of video frames and temporal
normality of RGB difference by designing two parallel streams consisting of
stacks. Thus, STHA can provide various representation learning abilities by
expanding or contracting hierarchically to detect anomalies of different
degrees. Since the anomaly set is complicated and unbounded, our STHA can
adjust its detection ability to adapt to the human detection demands and the
complexity degree of anomaly that happened in the history of a scene. We
conduct experiments on three benchmarks and perform extensive analysis, and the
results demonstrate that our method performs comparablely to the
state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we design a toy dataset to prove that
our model can better balance the learning ability to adapt to different

measurements correspond to the landmarks-based navigation technique.
Accordingly, an on-board camera is able to provide landmark pixels. The
aforementioned position-unmodeled acceleration dataset serves to train a mascon

optimal mass values and locations using Adam gradient descent. By a careful
choice of the mascon variables and constraints projection, the masses are
ensured to be positive and within the small body shape. The numerical results

Unfortunately, the implementation code of the algorithms is not always

a model that, given the runtime of an algorithm in a machine, estimates the

that the probability of estimating a runtime longer than what it should be is
arbitrarily low. Secondly, we introduce an adaptation of the one-sided sign

  Objective: We therefore wanted to study 1) the impact of RESTful API design

  Method: We conducted a controlled Web-based experiment with 105 participants,

on a crossover design, we studied 12 design rules using API snippets in two
complementary versions: one that adhered to a ""rule"" and one that was a

  Results: For 11 of the 12 rules, we found that ""violation"" performed

preventing the use of such methods in real-life missions still stand in the
way. In particular, the deployment of such computation-intensive algorithms is
still under-investigated, while the performance drop when training on synthetic

hybrid modular pipelines and direct end-to-end regression methods. A comparison

be informative to users when selecting on what to spend their attention:
through the wisdom of crowds, summed reactions may help identifying relevant

To restore wisdom-of-crowds effects, it is therefore desirable to separate the
inauthentic agents from the wise crowd, and use only the latter as a voting
*jury* on the relevance of a post. To this end, we design two *jury selection
procedures* (JSPs) that discard agents classified as inauthentic. Using machine
learning techniques, both cluster on binary vote data -- one using a Gaussian

efficiency in large-scale filaments possibly determine their hosting star
formation activities. Aims. We aim to automatically identify large-scale
filaments, characterize them, investigate their association with Galactic
structures, and study their DGMFs. Methods. We use a modified minimum spanning
tree (MST) algorithm to chain parsec-scale 13CO clumps previously extracted
from the SEDIGISM (Structure, Excitation, and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic
InterStellar Medium) survey. The MST connects nodes in a graph such that the
sum of edge lengths is minimum. Modified MST also ensures velocity coherence
between nodes, so the identified filaments are coherent in
position-position-velocity (PPV) space. Results. We generate a catalog of 88
large-scale ($>10pc$) filaments in the inner Galactic plane (with $-60^\circ <
l < 18^\circ and $|b| < 0.5^\circ$). These SEDIGISM filaments are larger and
less dense than MST filaments previously identified from the BGPS and ATLASGAL
surveys. We find that eight of the filaments run along spiral arms and can be
regarded as ""bones"" of the Milky Way. We also find three bones associated with
the Local Spur in PPV space. By compiling 168 large-scale filaments with
available DGMF across the Galaxy, an order of magnitude more than previously
investigated, we find that DGMFs do not correlate with Galactic location, but
bones have higher DGMFs than other filaments.

  In this paper, we propose a new plug-and-play module, X-adapter, to flexibly

  Specifically, we insert X-adapters into PLMs, and only the added parameters

  To fully exploit the potential in VLMs, X-adapters consist of two

  We can opt for activating different sub-modules depending on the downstream
tasks.

Multiple Access (SDMA) used in present-day standards. However, an experimental
demonstration of RSMA's benefits is missing in the literature. In this paper,
we address this gap by realizing an RSMA prototype using software-defined
radios. For the two-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario, we
measure the throughput performance of SDMA and RSMA in nine different scenarios
that vary in terms of the channel pathloss and spatial correlation experienced
by the users. Emulating perfect channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter through unquantized CSI feedback, we observe that RSMA achieves a
higher sum throughput (upto 57%) and more fairness than SDMA when the user
channels have high spatial correlation. Similarly, emulating imperfect CSI
through quantized feedback, RSMA - along with the above trend - also
experiences a smaller sum throughput loss, relative to the unquantized case
(37%, on average, as opposed to 44% for SDMA). These outcomes are consistent
with theoretical predictions, and demonstrate the feasibility and potential of
RSMA for next generation wireless networks (e.g., 6G).

remote drivers in the loop, their driving experience should be realistic to
secure safe and comfortable remote control.Therefore, the remote control tower
should be designed such that remote drivers receive high quality cues regarding
the vehicle state and the driving environment. In this direction, the steering
feedback could be manipulated to provide feedback to the remote drivers
regarding how the vehicle reacts to their commands. However, until now, it is
unclear how the remote drivers' steering feel could impact occupant's motion
comfort. This paper focuses on exploring how the driver feel in remote (RD) and
normal driving (ND) are related with motion comfort. More specifically,
different types of steering feedback controllers are applied in (a) the
steering system of a Research Concept Vehicle-model E (RCV-E) and (b) the
steering system of a remote control tower. An experiment was performed to
assess driver feel when the RCV-E is normally and remotely driven. Subjective
assessment and objective metrics are employed to assess drivers' feel and
occupants' motion comfort in both remote and normal driving scenarios. The
results illustrate that motion sickness and ride comfort are only affected by
the steering velocity in remote driving, while throttle input variations affect

We present the first implementation of the classical rotating diffuser concept

the straightforwardness and compactness of the LDHM imaging device. Prior to
the introduction of the rotating diffusor, we performed LDHM experimental

quantitative assessment of numerical amplitude/phase reconstruction of test

successfully corroborated in technical test target imaging and examination of
challenging biomedical sample (60um thick mouse brain tissue slice). Physical
minimization of coherent noise (up to 50%) was positively verified, while
preserving optimal spatial resolution of phase and amplitude imaging. Coherent
noise removal, ensured by proposed RD-LDHM method, is especially important in
biomedical inference, as speckles can falsely imitate valid biological

reducing the overhead of data movement between processor and memory. However,
most PIM solutions rely either on novel memory technologies that have yet to

to take the best of both worlds, i.e. performing GEMM in memory but using only
conventional SRAMs without the drawbacks of bit-serial computations. This
allows the user to design systems with significant performance gains using
existing technologies with little to no modifications. We first design a novel
approximate bit-parallel multiplier that approximates multiplications with
bitwise OR operations by leveraging multiple wordlines activation in the SRAM.
We then propose DAISM - Digital Approximate In-SRAM Multiplier architecture, an

underrepresented varieties including regional dialects, minority-speakers, and

varieties seen as 'prestigious', 'mainstream', or 'standard'. This can act as a
barrier to incorporating ASR technology into the annotation process for
large-scale linguistic research since the manual correction of the erroneous
automated transcripts can be just as time and resource consuming as manual
transcriptions. A deeper understanding of the behaviour of an ASR system is
thus beneficial from a speech technology standpoint, in terms of improving ASR
accuracy, and from an annotation standpoint, where knowing the likely errors
made by an ASR system can aid in this manual correction. This work demonstrates
a method of probing an ASR system to discover how it handles phonetic variation
across a number of L2 Englishes. Specifically, how particular phonetic
realisations which were rare or absent in the system's training data can lead
to phoneme level misrecognitions and contribute to higher WERs. It is
demonstrated that the behaviour of the ASR is systematic and consistent across
speakers with similar spoken varieties (in this case the same L1) and phoneme
substitution errors are typically in agreement with human annotators. By
identifying problematic productions specific weaknesses can be addressed by
sourcing such realisations for training and fine-tuning thus making the system

interaction and, hence, their role is critical for our understanding of human
behaviour and affect at a large scale. As artificial intelligence (AI) tools
are gradually adopted by the game industry a series of ethical concerns arise.
Such concerns, however, have so far not been extensively discussed in a video
game context. Motivated by the lack of a comprehensive review of the ethics of
AI as applied to games, we survey the current state of the art in this area and
discuss ethical considerations of these systems from the holistic perspective
of the affective loop. Through the components of this loop, we study the
ethical challenges that AI faces in video game development. Elicitation
highlights the ethical boundaries of artificially induced emotions; sensing
showcases the trade-off between privacy and safe gaming spaces; and detection,
as utilised during in-game adaptation, poses challenges to transparency and
ownership. This paper calls for an open dialogue and action for the games of
today and the virtual spaces of the future. By setting an appropriate framework
we aim to protect users and to guide developers towards safer and better
experiences for their customers.

prospects, especially for the autonomous driving task. To tackle the ill-posed
problem of 3D geometric reasoning from 2D monocular images, multi-frame
monocular methods are developed to leverage the perspective correlation
information from sequential temporal frames. However, moving objects such as
cars and trains usually violate the static scene assumption, leading to feature
inconsistency deviation and misaligned cost values, which would mislead the
optimization algorithm. In this work, we present CTA-Depth, a Context-aware
Temporal Attention guided network for multi-frame monocular Depth estimation.
Specifically, we first apply a multi-level attention enhancement module to
integrate multi-level image features to obtain an initial depth and pose
estimation. Then the proposed CTA-Refiner is adopted to alternatively optimize
the depth and pose. During the refinement process, context-aware temporal
attention (CTA) is developed to capture the global temporal-context

moving objects. In particular, we propose a long-range geometry embedding (LGE)

driver who can act as a fallback solution in a critical failure scenario, the
system has to be able to mitigate failures on its own and keep critical
applications operational. To reduce redundancy cost, graceful degradation can
be applied by repurposing hardware resources at run-time. Critical applications
can be kept operational by starting passive backups and shutting down
non-critical applications instead to make sufficient resources available. In
order to design such systems efficiently, the degradation effects on
reliability and cost savings have to be analyzed. In this paper we present our
approach to formally analyze the impact of graceful degradation on the
reliability of critical and non-critical applications. We then quantify the
effect of graceful degradation on the reliability of both critical and
non-critical applications in distributed automotive systems and compare the
achieved cost reduction with conventional redundancy approaches. In our
experiments redundancy overhead could be reduced by 80% compared to active
redundancy in a scenario with a balanced mix of critical and non-critical

detailed reliability and cost analysis of graceful degradation in distributed

conjectured that the only manifolds supporting an Anosov diffeomorphism are

equation of state with a finite number of parameters and occasionally include
extra parameters intended to capture phase transition phenomenology. However,
such models restrict the types of behavior allowed and may not match the true
equation of state. We introduce a complementary approach that extracts phase
transitions directly from the equation of state without relying on, and thus
being restricted by, an underlying parametrization. We then constrain the
presence of phase transitions in neutron stars with astrophysical data. Current
pulsar mass, tidal deformability, and mass-radius measurements disfavor only
the strongest of possible phase transitions (latent energy per particle
$\gtrsim 100\,\mathrm{MeV}$). Weaker phase transitions are consistent with
observations. We further investigate the prospects for measuring phase
transitions with future gravitational-wave observations and find that catalogs
of \result{$O(100)$} events will (at best) yield Bayes factors of $\sim 10:1$
in favor of phase transitions even when the true equation of state contains
very strong phase transitions. Our results reinforce the idea that neutron star
observations will primarily constrain trends in macroscopic properties rather
than detailed microscopic behavior. Fine-tuned equation of state models will
likely remain unconstrained in the near future.

intriguing phenomena in condensed matter systems such as topological phases or
many-body localization. Recently, instead of considering mere quantifiers of
entanglement like entanglement entropy, the study of entanglement structure in
terms of the entanglement spectrum has shifted into the focus leading to new
insights into fractional quantum Hall states and topological insulators, among
others. What remains a challenge is the experimental detection of such
fine-grained properties of quantum systems. The development of protocols for
detecting features of the entanglement spectrum in cold atom systems, which are
one of the leading platforms for quantum simulation, is thus highly desirable
and will open up new avenues for experimentally exploring quantum many-body
physics. Here we present a method to bound the width of the entanglement
spectrum, or entanglement dimension, of cold atoms in lattice geometries,
requiring only measurements in two experimentally accessible bases and
utilizing ballistic time-of-flight (ToF) expansion. Building on previous
proposals for entanglement certification for photon pairs, we first consider
entanglement between two atoms of different atomic species and later generalize
to higher numbers of atoms per species and multispecies configurations showing
multipartite high-dimensional entanglement. Through numerical simulations we
show that our method is robust against typical experimental noise effects and
thus will enable high-dimensional entanglement certification in systems of up
to 8 atoms using currently available experimental techniques.

In the last two decades, there has been significant research in improving the

high-performance libraries including ROMIO (implementation of MPI-IO), parallel

efficient I/O for scientific applications. However, there is very little
research done to evaluate and improve I/O performance of Java-based HPC

Java libraries is the lack of a standard API (something equivalent to MPI-IO).
Some adhoc solutions have been developed and used in proprietary applications,
but there is no general-purpose solution that can be used by performance hungry
applications. As part of this project, we plan to develop a Java-based parallel
I/O API inspired by the MPI-IO bindings (MPI 2.0 standard document) for C, C++,

develop a reference implementation on top of existing Java messaging libraries.

effectively utilize multimodal content to achieve more personalized
recommendations. Despite various proposed solutions, most of them overlook the
mismatch between the knowledge gained from independent feature extraction
processes and downstream recommendation tasks. Specifically, multimodal feature
extraction processes do not incorporate prior knowledge relevant to
recommendation tasks, while recommendation tasks often directly use these
multimodal features as side information. This mismatch can lead to model
fitting biases and performance degradation, which this paper refers to as the
\textit{curse of knowledge} problem. To address this issue, we propose using
knowledge soft integration to balance the utilization of multimodal features
and the curse of knowledge problem it brings about. To achieve this, we put
forward a Knowledge Soft Integration framework for the multimodal
recommendation, abbreviated as KSI, which is composed of the Structure
Efficiently Injection (SEI) module and the Semantic Soft Integration (SSI)
module. In the SEI module, we model the modality correlation between items
using Refined Graph Neural Network (RGNN), and introduce a regularization term
to reduce the redundancy of user/item representations. In the SSI module, we
design a self-supervised retrieval task to further indirectly integrate the
semantic knowledge of multimodal features, and enhance the semantic
discrimination of item representations. Extensive experiments on three

these inferences can be made on the basis of very sparse or indirect data, by
leveraging an inductive bias toward positing the existence of different

$\gamma$-ray emission resembling low power flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ),
but with differing physical properties. They are jetted, $\gamma$/radio-loud
Seyfert galaxies, with relatively low black hole masses, accreting at
exceptionally high, near-Eddington rates. Certain of these sources exhibit
highly variable emission states on relatively short time scales, the physical
origin of which remains elusive. In this work, varying emission states of two
bona-fide NLS1s, 1H 0323+342 and PMN J0948+0022, and one little studied
FSRQ/intermediate object, B2 0954+25A, are examined. For each source, we
analyzed quasi-simultaneous multiwavelength data for different states of
$\gamma$-ray activity and present the results of their broad-band emission
modelling, taking into account all available physical constraints to limit the
range of the model parameters. Two different scenarios are discussed, in the
framework of a one-zone leptonic model, where the high energy emission is due
to the inverse Compton scattering of the disc and broad line region (BLR) or
torus photons by relativistic electrons within the jet. The transition from low
to high state is well described by variations of the jet parameters, leaving
the external photon fields unchanged. The parameterisation favours an emission
scenario with particle injection on a stationary shock inside the jet. When
considering all physical constraints, the disc & BLR scenario is preferred for
all three sources. We use the multi-epoch modelling to characterize total jet
powers and discuss the intrinsic nature of $\gamma$-NLS1 galaxies and FSRQs.

For an incoming radial LUA trajectory to escape back to infinity, there exists
a bound on its magnitude of acceleration and the distance of closest approach
from the event horizon of the black hole. We calculate these bounds and the
shadow parameters, namely the photon sphere radius and the shadow radius,
explicitly for specific black hole solutions in $d$-dimensional Einstein's
theory of gravity, in pure Lovelock theory of gravity and in the
$\mathcal{F}(R)$ theory of gravity. We find that for a particular boundary

closest approach $r_b$ of the incoming radial LUA trajectory while the shadow
radius $r_{sh}$ is equal to the inverse magnitude of the acceleration bound
$|a|_b$ for the LUA trajectory to turn back to infinity. Using the effective

extractor, are adopted to deal with the domain shift. However, limited EEG data
quantity and strong individual difference are challenges for the DANN with
cumbersome feature extractor. In this work, we propose knowledge distillation
(KD) based lightweight DANN to enhance cross-subject EEG-based emotion
recognition. Specifically, the teacher model with strong context learning
ability is utilized to learn complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations
of EEG, and robust lightweight student model is guided by the teacher model to
learn more difficult domain-invariant features. In the feature-based KD
framework, a transformer-based hierarchical temporalspatial learning model is
served as the teacher model. The student model, which is composed of Bi-LSTM
units, is a lightweight version of the teacher model. Hence, the student model
could be supervised to mimic the robust feature representations of teacher
model by leveraging complementary latent temporal features and spatial
features. In the DANN-based cross-subject emotion recognition, we combine the
obtained student model and a lightweight temporal-spatial feature interaction
module as the feature extractor. And the feature aggregation is fed to the
emotion classifier and domain classifier for domain-invariant feature learning.
To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct the
subject-independent experiments on the public dataset DEAP with arousal and

the solution to the audio source separation task. First, previous audio source
separation systems mainly focus on separating one or a limited number of
specific sources. There is a lack of research on building a unified system that
can separate arbitrary sources via a single model. Second, most previous
systems require clean source data to train a separator, while clean source data

and separate active sound classes in a hierarchical level. To use large-scale
weakly labeled/unlabeled audio data for audio source separation, we propose a
universal audio source separation framework containing: 1) an audio tagging
model trained on weakly labeled data as a query net; and 2) a conditional
source separation model that takes query net outputs as conditions to separate
arbitrary sound sources. We investigate various query nets, source separation

human-labeled quality of some MT system output on some datasets for training,
making them domain-dependent and MT-system-dependent. There has been research
on unsupervised QE, which requires glass-box access to the MT systems, or
parallel MT data to generate synthetic errors for training QE models. In this
paper, we present Perturbation-based QE - a word-level Quality Estimation
approach that works simply by analyzing MT system output on perturbed input
source sentences. Our approach is unsupervised, explainable, and can evaluate
any type of blackbox MT systems, including the currently prominent large
language models (LLMs) with opaque internal processes. For language directions
with no labeled QE data, our approach has similar or better performance than
the zero-shot supervised approach on the WMT21 shared task. Our approach is
better at detecting gender bias and word-sense-disambiguation errors in
translation than supervised QE, indicating its robustness to out-of-domain
usage. The performance gap is larger when detecting errors on a nontraditional

distributions, if the crack propagation is intermittent. Here, we combine
macroscale crack tip tracking in fatigue crack growth measurements of aluminum
5005 samples with \emph{post-mortem} scanning electron microscopy imaging of

that we observe avalanche-like crack propagation, reflected in both the

total of 1811 spectral lines is employed for averaging Stokes-V profiles. Our
mapping is accompanied by a residual bootstrap error analysis. Magnetic flux
densities of the radial field component of up to plus/minus 115 +/- 5 G were
reconstructed for ksi Boo A while up to plus/minus 55 +/- 3G were reconstructed
for ksi Boo B. ksi Boo A's magnetic morphology is characterized by a very high
latitude, nearly polar, spot of negative polarity and three low-to-mid latitude
spots of positive polarity while ksi Boo B's morphology is characterized by
four low-to-mid latitude spots of mixed polarity. No polar magnetic field is
reconstructed for the cooler ksi Boo B star. Both our maps are dominated by the
radial field component, containing 86 and 89 percent of the magnetic energy of
ksi Boo A and B, respectively. We found only weak azimuthal and meridional

assemblies of phase oscillators whose interaction is mediated by a diffusing
chemical. The coupling effect results from the fact that the local
concentration of the mediating chemical affects both its production and
absorption by each oscillator. Since the chemical diffuses through the medium
in which the oscillators are embedded, the coupling among oscillators is
non-local: it considers all the oscillators depending on their relative spatial
distances. We considered a mathematical model for this coupling, when the
diffusion time is arbitrary with respect to the characteristic oscillator
periods, yielding a system of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations
which can be solved using Green functions for appropriate boundary conditions.
In this paper we show numerical solutions of these equations for three finite
domains: a linear one-dimensional interval, a rectangular, and a circular
region, with absorbing boundary conditions. From the numerical solutions we
investigate phase and frequency synchronization of the oscillators, with
respect to changes in the coupling parameters for the three considered
geometries.

idea lies in the observation that certain parameters in the models are easier
to optimize than others. In this paper, we focus on models where some
parameters have a linear nature, which is common in machine learning. In one
routine of the proposed algorithm, the linear parameters are updated by the
recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which is equivalent to a stochastic
Newton method; then, based on the updated linear parameters, the nonlinear

algorithm can be understood as a stochastic approximation version of block
coordinate gradient descent approach in which one part of the parameters is
updated by a second-order SGD method while the other part is updated by a
first-order SGD. Global convergence of the proposed online algorithm for

non-collective, i.e. consist of cylindrical surfaces evolving independently,
which significantly complicates their detection in observations. This
non-collective nature, however, can get modified in the nonlinear regime. To
address this question, the propagation of nonlinear torsional Alfv\'en waves in
straight magnetic flux tubes has been investigated numerically using the
astrophysical MHD code Athena++ and analytically, to support numerical results,
using the perturbation theory up to the second order. Numerical results have
revealed that there is radially uniform induced density perturbation whose
uniformity does not depend on the radial structure of the mother Alfv\'en wave.
Our analysis showed that the ponderomotive force leads to the induction of the
radial and axial velocity perturbations, while the mechanism for the density
perturbation is provided by a non-equal elasticity of a magnetic flux tube in
the radial and axial directions. The latter can be qualitatively understood by
the interplay between the Alfv\'en wave perturbations, external medium, and the
flux tube boundary conditions. The amplitude of these nonlinearly induced
density perturbations is found to be determined by the amplitude of the
Alfv\'en driver squared and the plasma parameter $\beta$. The existence of the
collective and radially uniform density perturbation accompanying nonlinear
torsional Alfv\'en waves could be considered as an additional observational
signature of Alfv\'en waves in the upper layers of the solar atmosphere.

developing more intelligent autonomous vehicles (AVs). A typical DRL
application on AVs is to train a neural network-based driving policy. However,
the black-box nature of neural networks can result in unpredictable decision
failures, making such AVs unreliable. To this end, this work proposes a method
to identify and protect unreliable decisions of a DRL driving policy. The basic
idea is to estimate and constrain the policy's performance uncertainty, which
quantifies potential performance drop due to insufficient training data or
network fitting errors. By constraining the uncertainty, the DRL model's
performance is always greater than that of a baseline policy. The uncertainty
caused by insufficient data is estimated by the bootstrapped method. Then, the
uncertainty caused by the network fitting error is estimated using an ensemble
network. Finally, a baseline policy is added as the performance lower bound to
avoid potential decision failures. The overall framework is called
uncertainty-bound reinforcement learning (UBRL). The proposed UBRL is evaluated
on DRL policies with different amounts of training data, taking an unprotected
left-turn driving case as an example. The result shows that the UBRL method can
identify potentially unreliable decisions of DRL policy. The UBRL guarantees to
outperform baseline policy even when the DRL policy is not well-trained and has
high uncertainty. Meanwhile, the performance of UBRL improves with more
training data. Such a method is valuable for the DRL application on real-road
driving and provides a metric to evaluate a DRL policy.

approach, whereby a minimal number of parameters are added to the model and
fine-tuned. However, adapters have not been sufficiently analyzed to understand
if PEFT translates to benefits in training/deployment efficiency and
maintainability/extensibility. Through extensive experiments on many adapters,
tasks, and languages in supervised and cross-lingual zero-shot settings, we
clearly show that for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, the parameter
efficiency in adapters does not translate to efficiency gains compared to full
fine-tuning of models. More precisely, adapters are relatively expensive to
train and have slightly higher deployment latency. Furthermore, the
maintainability/extensibility benefits of adapters can be achieved with simpler
approaches like multi-task training via full fine-tuning, which also provide
relatively faster training times. We, therefore, recommend that for moderately
sized models for NLU tasks, practitioners should rely on full fine-tuning or
multi-task training rather than using adapters. Our code is available at

observation has sparked rigorous research on temporal graphs within the last
years. In temporal graphs, we have a fixed set of nodes and the connections
between them are only available at certain time steps. This gives rise to a
plethora of algorithmic problems on such graphs, most prominently the problem
of finding temporal spanners, i.e., the computation of subgraphs that guarantee
all pairs reachability via temporal paths. To the best of our knowledge, only
centralized approaches for the solution of this problem are known. However,
many real-world networks are not shaped by a central designer but instead they
emerge and evolve by the interaction of many strategic agents. This observation
is the driving force of the recent intensive research on game-theoretic network
formation models.
  In this work we bring together these two recent research directions: temporal
graphs and game-theoretic network formation. As a first step into this new
realm, we focus on a simplified setting where a complete temporal host graph is
given and the agents, corresponding to its nodes, selfishly create incident
edges to ensure that they can reach all other nodes via temporal paths in the
created network. This yields temporal spanners as equilibria of our game. We
prove results on the convergence to and the existence of equilibrium networks,
on the complexity of finding best agent strategies, and on the quality of the
equilibria. By taking these first important steps, we uncover challenging open
problems that call for an in-depth exploration of the creation of temporal
graphs by strategic agents.

argon, a supercontinuum extending from 350 nm to 2 {\mu}m is generated through
modulational instability. Although argon and nitrogen exhibit similar Kerr
nonlinearity and dispersion, we find that the energy density of the continuum

Using numerical simulations, we find that due to the closely spaced rotational
lines in nitrogen, gain suppression in the fundamental mode causes part of the
pump pulse to be coupled into higher-order modes which reduces the energy
transfer to wavelengths shorter than the pump.

""long-tail"" challenges during natural driving: the SDVs will continually
encounter rare, safety-critical cases that may not be included in the dataset
they were trained. Some safety-assurance planners solve this problem by being
conservative in all possible cases, which may significantly affect driving
mobility. To this end, this work proposes a method to automatically adjust the
conservative level according to each case's ""long-tail"" rate, named dynamically
conservative planner (DCP). We first define the ""long-tail"" rate as an SDV's
confidence to pass a driving case. The rate indicates the probability of
safe-critical events and is estimated using the statistics bootstrapped method
with historical data. Then, a reinforcement learning-based planner is designed
to contain candidate policies with different conservative levels. The final
policy is optimized based on the estimated ""long-tail"" rate. In this way, the
DCP is designed to automatically adjust to be more conservative in
low-confidence ""long-tail"" cases while keeping efficient otherwise. The DCP is
evaluated in the CARLA simulator using driving cases with ""long-tail""
distributed training data. The results show that the DCP can accurately
estimate the ""long-tail"" rate to identify potential risks. Based on the rate,
the DCP automatically avoids potential collisions in ""long-tail"" cases using
conservative decisions while not affecting the average velocity in other
typical cases. Thus, the DCP is safer and more efficient than the baselines
with fixed conservative levels, e.g., an always conservative planner. This work
provides a technique to guarantee SDV's performance in unexpected driving cases
without resorting to a global conservative setting, which contributes to
solving the ""long-tail"" problem practically.

large-scale dataset consisting of camera images for VIE, which contains not
only the larger variance of layout, backgrounds, and fonts but also much more
types of entities. Besides, we propose a novel framework for end-to-end VIE
that combines the stages of OCR and information extraction in an end-to-end
learning fashion. Different from the previous end-to-end approaches that
directly adopt OCR features as the input of an information extraction module,
we propose to use contrastive learning to narrow the semantic gap caused by the
difference between the tasks of OCR and information extraction. We evaluate the
existing end-to-end methods for VIE on the proposed dataset and observe that
the performance of these methods has a distinguishable drop from SROIE (a
widely used English dataset) to our proposed dataset due to the larger variance

closed-form solution of the OT problem given by an affine mapping and learns an

explicitly probe the long wavelength hydrodynamic correlations in confined

typically applied in e.g. lubrication. Relaxation times obtained from
equilibrium fluctuations interpolate between the theoretical limits from bulk
hydrodynamics and continuum formulations with increasing wavelength. We show
how to exploit this characteristic transition to measure viscosity and slip
length in confined systems simultaneously from equilibrium MD simulations.
Moreover, the gap-averaged theory describes a geometry-induced dispersion
relation that leads to overdamped sound relaxation at large wavelengths, which
is confirmed by our MD simulations. Our results add to the understanding of
transport processes under strong confinement and might be of technological
relevance for the design of nanofluidic devices due to the recent progress in

explainable artificial intelligence, also known as XAI, which targets to
explain the results of such black box models to permit the desired assessment.
This survey analyses several recent studies in the XAI field applied to medical

Unseen expressions are modeled by blending appearance from a sparse set of

similar expression is performed at test time. We show that our method

fiber are spliced to different lengths of undoped fiber and then evaporated by
feeding into the focus of a CO$_{2}$ laser. During evaporation, erbium ions are
precipitated in the doped silica fiber to control the erbium concentration in
the remaining SiO$_2$, which is melted into a microsphere. By increasing the
length of the undoped section, a critical point is reached where effectively no
ions remain in the glass microsphere. The critical point is found using the
lasing spectra of the whispering gallery modes in microspheres with equal
sizes. From the critical point, it is estimated that, for a given CO$_{2}$
laser power, $6.36 \times 10^{-21}$~mol of Er$^{3+}$ is lost during the
evaporation process for every cubic micron of silica fiber. This is equivalent
to $1.74 \times 10^{-7}$~mol of Er$^{3+}$ lost per mol of SiO$_{2}$ evaporated.

systems. The method consists of employing a retrospective end-user walkthrough
with the objective of providing support to HCI practitioners so that they may
gain an understanding of the higher order cognitive processes in place and the
role that AI model outputs play in human-AI decision-making. The method was
qualitatively assessed with 29 participants (four participants in a pilot
phase; 25 participants in the main user study) interacting with a human-AI
decision-making system in the context of financial decision-making. The system
combines visual analytics, three AI models for revenue prediction, AI-supported

results on tasks and usability problems, outcomes presented suggest that the
method is promising in highlighting why AI models are ignored, used, or

analytically differentiated with respect to cosmology, or any systematics

simulation. We find that the peak counts outperform the power spectrum on the
cold dark matter parameter $\Omega_c$, on the amplitude of density fluctuations
$\sigma_8$, and on the amplitude of the intrinsic alignment signal $A_{IA}$.

due to their highly rate sensitive behavior. In this context, we are interested
in the quasi-static response of a viscoelastic solid subjected to damage. This
paper outlines a new incremental variational based approach and its
computational implementation to model damage in viscoelastic solids. The
variational formalism allows us to embed the local constitutive equations into
a global incremental potential, the minimization of which provides the solution
to the mechanical problem. Softening damage models in their local form are
known to result in spurious mesh-sensitive results, and hence non-locality (or
regularization) has to be introduced to preserve the mathematical relevance of
the problem. In the present paper, we consider two different regularization
techniques for the viscoelastic damage model : a particular phase-field and a
lip-field approach. The model parameters are calibrated to obtain some
equivalence between both these approaches. Numerical results are then presented
for the bidimensional case and both these approaches compare well. Numerical
results also demonstrate the ability of the model to qualitatively represent
the typical rate-dependent behaviour of the viscoelastic materials. Besides,
the novelty of the present work lies in the use of lip-field approach for the
first time in a viscoelastic context.

dose engine will compute the dose contribution on-line during the optimization,
the final main optimization method requires to keep in memory a very

combinations of the ordered categorical response and covariates that are
heterogeneous compared to other pairs, makes the inference with the ordinal
response model unreliable. In this article, we prove that the posterior
distribution in the ordinal response model does not satisfy the posterior
robustness with any link functions, i.e., the posterior cannot ignore the
influence of large outliers. Furthermore, to achieve robust Bayesian inference
in the ordinal response model, this article defines general posteriors in the
ordinal response model with two robust divergences (the density-power and
$\gamma$-divergences) based on the framework of the general posterior
inference. We also provide an algorithm for generating posterior samples from

resulted in an increased interest in the community to either develop new

progress in this direction, we investigate four competitive V&L models on four

can impact performance more than scaling Web data, which even degrades
performance sometimes. Through a deeper investigation of X-VLM, we highlight
the importance of both novel losses and rich data sources for learning
fine-grained skills. Finally, we inspect training dynamics, and discover that
for some tasks, performance peaks early in training or significantly

ejected from the center of Radio-Loud AGN affect the sources surrounding
intracluster medium/intergalactic medium. Placing constraints on the age of
such sources is important in order to measure the jet powers and determine the
effects on feedback. To evaluate the age of these sources using spectral age
models, we require high-resolution multi-wavelength data. The new sensitive and
high-resolution MIGHTEE survey of the XMM-LSS field along with data from the
Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
provide data taken at different frequencies with similar resolution, which
enables us to determine the spectral age distribution for radio loud AGN in the
survey field. In this study we present a sample of 28 radio galaxies with their
best fitting spectral age distribution analyzed using the Jaffe-Perola (JP)
model on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Fits are generally good and objects in our
sample show maximum ages within the range of 2.8 Myr to 115 Myr with a median
of 8.71 Myr. High-resolution maps over a range of frequencies are required to
observe detailed age distributions for small sources and high-sensitivity maps
will be needed in order to observe fainter extended emission. We do not observe
any correlation between the total physical size of the sources and their age
and we speculate both dynamical models and the approach to spectral age
analysis may need some modification to account for our observations.

which can be deduced from their optical spectra and used in model atmospheres
to predict their spectral energy distribution (SED). Based on this, three
bright DAWDs have defined the spectrophotometric flux scale of the CALSPEC
system of HST. In this paper we add 32 new fainter (16.5 < V < 19.5) DAWDs
spread over the whole sky and within the dynamic range of large telescopes.
Using ground based spectra and panchromatic photometry with HST/WFC3, a new
hierarchical analysis process demonstrates consistency between model and

{\AA} to 7750 {\AA} and to 0.008 mag rms at 1.6{\mu}m for the total set of 35

unprecedented accuracy from the near ultraviolet to the near-infrared, suitable
for both ground and space based observatories. They are embedded in existing

are increasingly used for safety monitoring and to help guide regulatory

decisions transparently and objectively to ensure that analyses meet their
intended goals. The Causal Roadmap is an established framework that can guide
and document analytic decisions through each step of the analytic pipeline,
which will help investigators generate high-quality real-world evidence. In
this paper, we illustrate the utility of the Causal Roadmap using two case
studies previously led by workgroups sponsored by the Sentinel Initiative -- a
program for actively monitoring the safety of regulated medical products. Each
case example focuses on different aspects of the analytic pipeline for drug
safety monitoring. The first case study shows how the Causal Roadmap encourages
transparency, reproducibility, and objective decision-making for causal
analyses. The second case study highlights how this framework can guide
analytic decisions beyond inference on causal parameters, improving outcome
ascertainment in clinical phenotyping. These examples provide a structured
framework for implementing the Causal Roadmap in safety surveillance and guide
transparent, reproducible, and objective analysis.

(e.g., documents or videos) is always accessible to solve the task.
Alternatively, memory networks were introduced to mimic the human process of
incremental comprehension and compression of the information in a
fixed-capacity memory. However, these models only learn how to maintain memory
by backpropagating errors in the answers through the entire network. Instead,
it has been suggested that humans have effective mechanisms to boost their
memorization capacities, such as rehearsal and anticipation. Drawing
inspiration from these, we propose a memory model that performs rehearsal and
anticipation while processing inputs to memorize important information for
solving question answering tasks from streaming data. The proposed mechanisms
are applied self-supervised during training through masked modeling tasks
focused on coreference information. We validate our model on a short-sequence
(bAbI) dataset as well as large-sequence textual (NarrativeQA) and video
(ActivityNet-QA) question answering datasets, where it achieves substantial
improvements over previous memory network approaches. Furthermore, our ablation
study confirms the proposed mechanisms' importance for memory models.

primordial black holes and from the gravitational interactions of those
primordial black holes among themselves and other astrophysical black holes. We
specifically focus on asynchronous bubble nucleation during a first order phase
transition as the creation mechanism. We have used two benchmark phase
transitions through which the primordial black holes and the primary
gravitational wave spectra have been generated. We have considered binary
systems and close hyperbolic interactions of primordial black holes with other
primordial and astrophysical black holes as the source of the secondary part of
the spectra. We have shown that this unique cumulative spectra have features
which directly and indirectly depend on the specifics of the production
mechanism.

conventional partial differential equation (PDE) solvers by offering more
accurate and flexible PDE solutions. However, they are hampered by the
relatively slow convergence and the need to perform additional, potentially
expensive, training for different PDE parameters. To solve this limitation, we
introduce latentPINN, a framework that utilizes latent representations of the
PDE parameters as additional (to the coordinates) inputs into PINNs and allows
for training over the distribution of these parameters. Motivated by the recent
progress on generative models, we promote the use of latent diffusion models to
learn compressed latent representations of the PDE parameters distribution and
act as input parameters to NN functional solutions. We use a two-stage training
scheme in which the first stage, we learn the latent representations for the
distribution of PDE parameters. In the second stage, we train a
physics-informed neural network over inputs given by randomly drawn samples
from the coordinate space within the solution domain and samples from the
learned latent representation of the PDE parameters. We test the approach on a
class of level set equations given by the nonlinear Eikonal equation. We
specifically share results corresponding to three different sets of Eikonal
parameters (velocity models). The proposed method performs well on new phase

feedback on galactic metal retention and the motion of metals and gas into and
through the CGM of L$_{*}$ galaxies. We examine 140 galaxies from the 25 Mpc
cosmological volume, Romulus25, with stellar masses between 3 $\times$ 10$^{9}$
- 3 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$. We measure the fraction of metals remaining
in the ISM and CGM of each galaxy, and calculate the expected mass of its SMBH
based on the $M-\sigma$ relation. The deviation of each SMBH from its expected
mass, $\Delta M_{BH}$ is compared to the potential of its host via $\sigma$. We
find that SMBHs with accreted mass above the empirical $M-\sigma$ relation are
about 15\% more effective at removing metals from the ISM than under-massive
SMBHs in star forming galaxies. Over-massive SMBHs suppress the overall star
formation of their host galaxies and more effectively move metals from the ISM
into the CGM. However, we see little evidence for the evacuation of gas from
their halos, in contrast with other simulations. Finally, we predict that C IV
column densities in the CGM of L$_{*}$ galaxies may depend on host galaxy SMBH
mass. Our results show that the scatter in the low mass end of $M-\sigma$

mass in its host galaxy.

pronounced when employing an effective yet time-consuming autoregressive
context model since it would increase entropy decoding time by orders of
magnitude. In this paper, unlike most previous works that pursue optimal RD
performance while temporally overlooking the coding complexity, we make a
systematical investigation on the rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) optimization
in neural image compression. By quantifying the decoding complexity as a factor
in the optimization goal, we are now able to precisely control the RDC
trade-off and then demonstrate how the rate-distortion performance of neural
image codecs could adapt to various complexity demands. Going beyond the
investigation of RDC optimization, a variable-complexity neural codec is
designed to leverage the spatial dependencies adaptively according to
industrial demands, which supports fine-grained complexity adjustment by
balancing the RDC tradeoff. By implementing this scheme in a powerful base

metaheuristic algorithm. The motive for inventing this method is children's
learning behavior and cognitive development, with the golden ratio employed to
optimize their artwork's aesthetic value. Unfortunately, CDDO suffers from low
performance in the exploration phase, and the local best solution stagnates.
Harmony search (HS) is a highly competitive algorithm relative to other
prevalent metaheuristic algorithms, as its exploration phase performance on
unimodal benchmark functions is outstanding. Thus, to avoid these issues, we
present CDDOHS, a hybridization of both standards of CDDO and HS. The
hybridized model proposed consists of two phases. Initially, the pattern size
(PS) is relocated to the algorithm's core and the initial pattern size is set
to 80 % of the total population size. Second, the standard harmony search (HS)
is added to the pattern size (PS) for the exploration phase to enhance and
update the solution after each iteration. Experiments are evaluated using two
distinct standard benchmark functions, known as classical test functions,
including 23 common functions and 10 CEC-C06 2019 functions. Additionally, the
suggested CDDOHS is compared to CDDO, HS, and six other widely used algorithms.
Using the Wilcoxon ranksum test, the results indicate that CDDOHS beats
alternative algorithms.

used in dense user scenarios with high bandwidth requirements, that necessitate
efficient and accurate beam prediction. Machine learning (ML) based approaches
are ushering as a critical solution for achieving such efficient beam
prediction for 6G mmWave communications. However, most contemporary ML
classifiers are quite susceptible to adversarial inputs. Attackers can easily
perturb the methodology through noise addition in the model itself. To mitigate
this, the current work presents a defensive mechanism for attenuating the
adversarial attacks against projected ML-based models for mmWave beam
anticipation by incorporating adversarial training. Furthermore, as training 6G
mmWave beam prediction model necessitates the use of large and comprehensive
datasets that could include sensitive information regarding the user's
location, differential privacy (DP) has been introduced as a technique to
preserve the confidentiality of the information by purposefully adding a low
sensitivity controlled noise in the datasets. It ensures that even if the
information about a user location could be retrieved, the attacker would have
no means to determine whether the information is significant or meaningless.
With ray-tracing simulations for various outdoor and indoor scenarios, we
illustrate the advantage of our proposed novel framework in terms of beam

properties based on the friction of slender concentric sliding columns. We
begin by searching for the optimal topology in the simplest telescopic system

parameters are material independent and scale invariant. Based on a multiscale
self-similar reconstruction, we end-up with a theoretical optimal fractal limit
system whose cross section resembles the classical Sierpi\'nski triangle. Our
optimal construction is finally completed by considering the possibility of a
complete plane tessellation. The direct comparison of the dissipation per unit
volume with the material dissipation up to the elastic limit shows a great
advantage: . Such result is already attained for a realistic case of three only
scales of refinement leading almost (96%) the same dissipation of the fractal
limit. We also show the possibility of easy recovering of the original
configuration after dissipation and we believe that our schematic system can
have interesting reliable applications in different technological fields.
  Interestingly, our multiscale dissipative mechanism is reminiscent of similar
strategies observed in nature as a result of bioadaptation such as in the
archetypical cases of bone, nacre and spider silk. Even though other phenomena
such as inelastic behavior and full tridimensional optimization are surely
important in such biological systems, we believe that the suggested dissipation

hierarchical structures observed in important biological examples.

  Processing",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Extracting information from the electrocardiography (ECG) signal is an
essential step in the design of digital health technologies in cardiology. In
recent years, several machine learning (ML) algorithms for automatic extraction
of information in ECG have been proposed. Supervised learning methods have
successfully been used to identify specific aspects in the signal, like
detection of rhythm disorders (arrhythmias). Self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods, on the other hand, can be used to extract all the features contained
in the data. The model is optimized without any specific goal and learns from
the data itself. By adapting state-of-the-art computer vision methodologies to
the signal processing domain, a few SSL approaches have been reported recently
for ECG processing. However, such SSL methods require either data augmentation
or negative pairs, which limits the method to only look for similarities
between two ECG inputs, either two versions of the same signal or two signals
from the same subject. This leads to models that are very effective at
extracting characteristics that are stable in a subject, such as gender or age.
But they are not successful at capturing changes within the ECG recording that
can explain dynamic aspects, like different arrhythmias or different sleep
stages. In this work, we introduce the first SSL method that uses neither data
augmentation nor negative pairs for understanding ECG signals, and still,
achieves comparable quality representations. As a result, it is possible to
design a SSL method that not only captures similarities between two inputs, but
also captures dissimilarities for a complete understanding of the data. In
addition, a model based on transformer blocks is presented, which produces
better results than a model based on convolutional layers (XResNet50) with
almost the same number of parameters.

modality serves as the ground-ing key, which the complementary modality (in
this case, the image) is anchored with. IMAGINATOR encapsulates three
individual representations: (i) object-object co-location, (ii) word-object

complementary aspects of the two modalities which are further combined to
obtain the final JEs.

with a high device density. Traditional wireless network architectures have
difficulty flexibly obtaining and maintaining global network state information
and cannot quickly respond to network state changes, thus affecting the
throughput, delay, and other QoS requirements of existing multicasting
solutions. Therefore, this paper proposes a new multicast routing method based
on multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL-MR) in a software-defined
wireless networking (SDWN) environment. First, SDWN technology is adopted to
flexibly configure the network and obtain network state information in the form
of traffic matrices representing global network links information, such as link
bandwidth, delay, and packet loss rate. Second, the multicast routing problem
is divided into multiple subproblems, which are solved through multiagent
cooperation. To enable each agent to accurately understand the current network
state and the status of multicast tree construction, the state space of each
agent is designed based on the traffic and multicast tree status matrices, and
the set of AP nodes in the network is used as the action space. A novel
single-hop action strategy is designed, along with a reward function based on
the four states that may occur during tree construction: progress, invalid,
loop, and termination. Finally, a decentralized training approach is combined
with transfer learning to enable each agent to quickly adapt to dynamic network
changes and accelerate convergence. Simulation experiments show that MADRL-MR
outperforms existing algorithms in terms of throughput, delay, packet loss

introduces an intelligent routing algorithm (DRL-PPONSA) based on proximal
policy optimization deep reinforcement learning with network situational
awareness under a software-defined wireless networking architecture. First, a
specific data plane is designed for network topology construction and data
forwarding. The control plane collects network traffic information, sends flow
tables, and uses a GCN-GRU prediction mechanism to perceive future traffic
change trends to achieve network situational awareness. Second, a DRL-based
data forwarding mechanism is designed in the knowledge plane. The predicted
network traffic matrix and topology information matrix are treated as the
environment for DRL agents, while next-hop adjacent nodes are treated as
executable actions. Accordingly, action selection strategies are designed for
different network conditions to achieve more intelligent, flexible, and
efficient routing control. The reward function is designed using network link
information and various reward and penalty mechanisms. Additionally, importance
sampling and gradient clipping techniques are employed during gradient updating
to enhance convergence speed and stability. Experimental results show that
DRL-PPONSA outperforms traditional routing methods in network throughput,
delay, packet loss rate, and wireless node distance. Compared to
value-function-based Dueling DQN routing, the convergence speed is
significantly improved, and the convergence effect is more stable.
Simultaneously, its consumption of hardware storage space is reduced, and

foster the research on energy-efficient pre-processing algorithms and AI models
for onboard-satellite applications. In this framework, we present THRawS, the
first dataset composed of Sentinel-2 (S-2) raw data containing warm temperature
hotspots (wildfires and volcanic eruptions). To foster the realisation of
robust AI architectures, the dataset gathers data from all over the globe.
Furthermore, we designed a custom methodology to identify events in raw data
starting from the corresponding Level-1C (L1C) products. Indeed, given the
availability of state-of-the-art algorithms for thermal anomalies detection on
the L1C tiles, we detect such events on these latter and we then re-project
them on the corresponding raw images. Additionally, to deal with unprocessed
data, we devise a lightweight coarse coregisteration and georeferencing
strategy. The developed dataset is comprehensive of more than 100 samples
containing wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and event-free volcanic areas to
enable both warm-events detection and general classification applications.
Finally, we compare performances between the proposed coarse spatial
coregistration technique and the SuperGlue Deep Neural Network method to
highlight the different constraints in terms of timing and quality of spatial
registration to minimise the spatial displacement error for a specific scene.

various geoscience applications. Given the complexity of the problem, deep
generative learning is a promising approach to overcome the limitations of
traditional geostatistical simulation models, in particular their lack of
physical realism. This research aims to investigate the application of
generative adversarial networks and deep variational inference for
conditionally simulating meandering channels in underground volumes. In this
paper, we review the generative deep learning approaches, in particular the
adversarial ones and the stabilization techniques that aim to facilitate their
training. The proposed approach is tested on 2D and 3D simulations generated by
the stochastic process-based model Flumy. Morphological metrics are utilized to
compare our proposed method with earlier iterations of generative adversarial
networks. The results indicate that by utilizing recent stabilization
techniques, generative adversarial networks can efficiently sample from target
data distributions. Moreover, we demonstrate the ability to simulate
conditioned simulations through the latent variable model property of the
proposed approach.

most elusive elements of biological information processing. The often
logarithmic nature of information in amplitude and frequency presented to
biosystems prevents simple encapsulation of the information contained in the
input. Criticality Analysis (CA) is a bio-inspired method of information
representation within a controlled self-organised critical system that allows
scale-free representation. This is based on the concept of a reservoir of
dynamic behaviour in which self-similar data will create dynamic nonlinear
representations. This unique projection of data preserves the similarity of
data within a multidimensional neighbourhood. The input can be reduced
dimensionally to a projection output that retains the features of the overall
data, yet has much simpler dynamic response. The method depends only on the
rate control of chaos applied to the underlying controlled models, that allows
the encoding of arbitrary data, and promises optimal encoding of data given
biological relevant networks of oscillators. The CA method allows for a
biologically relevant encoding mechanism of arbitrary input to biosystems,
creating a suitable model for information processing in varying complexity of
organisms and scale-free data representation for machine learning.

principle of current electronics, which heavily relies on the tunable charge
degree of freedom, faces increasing challenges to meet the future requirements
of speed, switching energy, heat dissipation, packing density as well as
functionalities. Heterogeneous integration, where dissimilar layers of
materials and functionalities are unrestrictedly stacked at an atomic scale, is
appealing to next-generation electronics, such as multi-functional,
neuromorphic, spintronic and ultra-low power devices, because it unlocks
technologically useful interfaces of distinct functionalities. Recently, the
combination of functional perovskite oxides and the two-dimensional layered
materials (2DLMs) led to unexpected functionalities and enhanced device
performance. In this review, we review the recent progress of the heterogeneous
integration of perovskite oxides and 2DLMs from the perspectives of fabrication
and interfacial properties, electronic applications, challenges as well as
outlooks. In particular, we focus on three types of attractive applications,
namely field-effect transistors, memory, and neuromorphic electronics. The van
der Waals integration approach is extendible to other oxides and 2DLMs, leading
to almost unlimited combinations of oxides and 2DLMs and contributing to future
high-performance electronic and spintronic devices.

has not shown that these models can attain nontrivial likelihoods on standard

closing the likelihood gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based language
models, with the goal of building and releasing a diffusion model which
outperforms a small but widely-known autoregressive model. We pursue this goal
through algorithmic improvements, scaling laws, and increased compute. On the
algorithmic front, we introduce several methodological improvements for the
maximum-likelihood training of diffusion language models. We then study scaling
laws for our diffusion models and find compute-optimal training regimes which
differ substantially from autoregressive models. Using our methods and scaling
analysis, we train and release Plaid 1B, a large diffusion language model which
outperforms GPT-2 124M in likelihood on benchmark datasets and generates fluent
samples in unconditional and zero-shot control settings.

compared on their ability to identify people from body shape in images captured
across a large range of distances/views (close-range, 100m, 200m, 270m, 300m,
370m, 400m, 490m, 500m, 600m, and at elevated pitch in images taken by an
unmanned aerial vehicle [UAV]). Accuracy, as measured by identity-match ranking
and false accept errors in an open-set test, was surprisingly good. For
identity-ranking, linguistic models were more accurate for close-range images,
whereas non-linguistic models fared better at intermediary distances. Fusion of
the linguistic and non-linguistic embeddings improved performance at all, but
the farthest distance. Although the non-linguistic model yielded fewer false
accepts at all distances, fusion of the linguistic and non-linguistic models
decreased false accepts for all, but the UAV images. We conclude that
linguistic and non-linguistic representations of body shape can offer
complementary identity information for bodies that can improve identification

linear bandit problem, in which the feature vectors have a high dimension $d$
whereas the reward function depends on only a limited set of features -
precisely $s_0 \ll d$. Furthermore, the learning follows under
information-sharing constraints. The proposed method employs Lasso regression
for dimension reduction, allowing each agent to independently estimate an
approximate set of main dimensions and share that information with others
depending on the network's structure. The information is then aggregated
through a specific process and shared with all agents. Each agent then resolves
the problem with ridge regression focusing solely on the extracted dimensions.
We represent algorithms for both a star-shaped network and a peer-to-peer
network. The approaches effectively reduce communication costs while ensuring
minimal cumulative regret per agent. Theoretically, we show that our proposed
methods have a regret bound of order $\mathcal{O}(s_0 \log d + s_0 \sqrt{T})$

high-dimensional multi-agent problems where efficient feature extraction is
critical for minimizing regret. To validate the effectiveness of our approach,

misclassified exposure patterns and therefore to biased effect estimates. This
is often the case for lifestyle exposures in epidemiology, e.g. for dietary
variables measured on daily basis. We introduce three new algorithms for
correcting the biased effect estimates, which are based on regression
calibration (RC), simulation extrapolation (SIMEX) and multiple imputation
(MI). In addition, the naive method ignoring the measurement error structure is
considered for comparison. These methods are combined with the k-means cluster
algorithm and the Gaussian mixture model to derive exposure patterns. The
performance of the correction methods is compared in a simulation study
regarding absolute, maximum and relative bias. The simulated data mimic a
typical situation in nutritional epidemiology when diet is assessed using
repeated 24-hour dietary recalls. Continuous and binary outcomes are
considered. Simulation results show, that the correction method based on RC and
MI perform better than the naive and the SIMEX-based method. Furthermore, the
MI-based approach, which can use outcome information in the error model, is
superior to the RC-based approach in most scenarios. Therefore, we recommend
using the MI-based approach.

time-indexed formulations with strong relaxations, the size of these

prohibitively large. The recently-developed dynamic discretization discovery
(DDD) method allows many time-dependent problems to become more tractable by
iteratively solving instances of the problem on smaller networks where each
node has its own discrete set of departure times. However, in the current
implementation of DDD, all arcs departing a common node share the same set of
departure times. This causes DDD to be ineffective for solving problems where
all near-optimal solutions require many distinct departure times at the
majority of the high-degree nodes in the network. Region-based networks are one
such structure that often leads to many high-degree nodes, and their increasing
popularity underscores the importance of tailoring solution methods for these
networks.
  To improve methods for solving problems that require many departure times at
nodes, we develop a DDD framework where the set of departure times is
determined on the arc level rather than the node level. We apply this arc-based
DDD method to instances of the service network design problem (SND). We show
that an arc-based approach is particularly advantageous when instances arise
from region-based networks, and when candidate paths are fixed in the base

This work investigates how mock spectra generated using a single galaxy in a

real galaxy. We create 22,500 C II and Si II spectra from the virtual galaxy at
different times and through multiple lines of sight and compare them with the
45 observations of low-redshift star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy
Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). We find that the mock profiles provide accurate
replicates to the observations of 38 galaxies with a broad range of stellar
masses ($10^6$ to $10^9$ $M_\odot$) and metallicities (0.02 to 0.55 $Z_\odot$).
Additionally, we highlight that aperture losses explain the weakness of the
fluorescent emission in several CLASSY spectra and must be accounted for when
comparing simulations to observations. Overall, we show that the evolution of a
single simulated galaxy can produce a large diversity of spectra whose
properties are representative of galaxies of comparable or smaller masses.
Building upon these results, we explore the origin of the continuum, residual
flux, and fluorescent emission in the simulation. We find that these different
spectral features all emerge from distinct regions in the galaxy's ISM, and
their characteristics can vary as a function of the viewing angle. While these
outcomes challenge simplified interpretations of down-the-barrel spectra, our
results indicate that high-resolution simulations provide an optimal framework

or more. Atomistic simulations indicate that this arises from (fully
reversible) electroporation of the lipid bilayers under the potential-driven
inter-surface electric fields. The porated topology of the bilayers leads to
increased dehydration-induced attraction between the headgroups of opposing
bilayers; at the same time, the porated bilayer structures may bridge the gap
between the sliding surfaces. These effects act in parallel to modulate the
friction by topologically-forcing the slip plane to pass through the
intra-bilayer acyl tail interface, for which {\mu}{\approx}0.1. This enables
facile, fully-reversible electro-modulation of the friction, with a dynamic
range up to some 2 orders of magnitude larger than achieved to date.

Anderson/nonlinear acceleration methods, their global convergence rates have
remained elusive for over 50 years. This paper addresses this long-standing
question by introducing a framework that derives novel and adaptive
quasi-Newton or nonlinear/Anderson acceleration schemes. Under mild
assumptions, the proposed iterative methods exhibit explicit, non-asymptotic
convergence rates that blend those of gradient descent and Cubic Regularized
Newton's method. Notably, these rates are achieved adaptively, as the method
autonomously determines the optimal step size using a simple backtracking

improves the convergence rate on convex functions. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed framework, even compared to a

  Historical Data in Analysis of Randomized Trials","12 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are a cornerstone of comparative
effectiveness because they remove the confounding bias present in observational
studies. However, RCTs are typically much smaller than observational studies
because of financial and ethical considerations. Therefore it is of great
interest to be able to incorporate plentiful observational data into the
analysis of smaller RCTs. Previous estimators developed for this purpose rely
on unrealistic additional assumptions without which the added data can bias the
effect estimate. Recent work proposed an alternative method (prognostic
adjustment) that imposes no additional assumption and increases efficiency in
the analysis of RCTs. The idea is to use the observational data to learn a
prognostic model: a regression of the outcome onto the covariates. The
predictions from this model, generated from the RCT subjects' baseline
variables, are used as a covariate in a linear model. In this work, we extend
this framework to work when conducting inference with nonparametric efficient
estimators in trial analysis. Using simulations, we find that this approach
provides greater power (i.e., smaller standard errors) than without prognostic
adjustment, especially when the trial is small. We also find that the method is
robust to observed or unobserved shifts between the observational and trial
populations and does not introduce bias. Lastly, we showcase this estimator
leveraging real-world historical data on a randomized blood transfusion study

table contents and avoid information loss. However, IoU and IoU-based loss
functions cannot directly reflect the degree of information loss for the

to measure the information loss of the prediction results.
  Besides, tables in the documents are usually large, sparsely distributed, and
have no overlaps because they are designed to summarize essential information

study, we use SparseR-CNN as the base model, and further improve the model by
using Gaussian Noise Augmented Image Size region proposals and many-to-one

  To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method and compare with

show that the proposed method can consistently outperform state-of-the-art

further experiments to show the superiority of the proposed decoupled IoU for
the TD applications by replacing the IoU-based loss functions and evaluation

current source routing protocols with PCH allow each sender to make routing

scalability (e.g., deadlock) for not considering other senders' requests. This
paper proposes a novel multi-PCHs solution with high scalability. First, we are
the first to study the PCH placement problem and propose optimal/approximation
solutions with load balancing for small-scale and large-scale scenarios, by
trading off communication costs among participants and turning the original
NP-hard problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem solving
by supermodular techniques. Then, on global network states and local directly

high-performance deadlock-free routing. Extensive experiments show that our

By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators we show that the

depends on the generated response. We then propose and compare several

the fragile topology of the gapped bottom band(s). Utilizing the classification

the limited availability of photorealistic training environments, which makes
it hard to generalize to new and unseen environments. To address this problem,
we propose PanoGen, a generation method that can potentially create an infinite
number of diverse panoramic environments conditioned on text. Specifically, we
collect room descriptions by captioning the room images in existing
Matterport3D environments, and leverage a state-of-the-art text-to-image
diffusion model to generate the new panoramic environments. We use recursive
outpainting over the generated images to create consistent 360-degree panorama
views. Our new panoramic environments share similar semantic information with
the original environments by conditioning on text descriptions, which ensures
the co-occurrence of objects in the panorama follows human intuition, and
creates enough diversity in room appearance and layout with image outpainting.
Lastly, we explore two ways of utilizing PanoGen in VLN pre-training and
fine-tuning. We generate instructions for paths in our PanoGen environments
with a speaker built on a pre-trained vision-and-language model for VLN
pre-training, and augment the visual observation with our panoramic
environments during agents' fine-tuning to avoid overfitting to seen
environments. Empirically, learning with our PanoGen environments achieves the
new state-of-the-art on the Room-to-Room, Room-for-Room, and CVDN datasets.
Pre-training with our PanoGen speaker data is especially effective for CVDN,
which has under-specified instructions and needs commonsense knowledge. Lastly,

Employing monocular depth estimation (MDE) networks, pretrained on large-scale

achieves robust NeRF reconstruction with a handful of real-world images by
combining the strengths of NeRF and monocular depth estimation through online
complementary training. Our framework imposes the MDE network's powerful
geometry prior to NeRF representation at both seen and unseen viewpoints to
enhance its robustness and coherence. In addition, we overcome the ambiguity
problems of monocular depths through patch-wise scale-shift fitting and
geometry distillation, which adapts the MDE network to produce depths aligned
accurately with NeRF geometry. Experiments show our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results both quantitatively and qualitatively, demonstrating

popularity in recent years due to their expanding range of applications in
various formal reasoning tasks. Often, they are used for equality saturation, a
process of deriving consequences through repeatedly applying universally
quantified equality formulas via term rewriting. They handle equality reasoning
over a large spaces of terms, but are severely limited in their handling of
case splitting and other types of logical cuts, especially when compared to
other reasoning techniques such as sequent calculi and resolution. The main
difficulty is when equality reasoning requires multiple inconsistent
assumptions to reach a single conclusion. Ad-hoc solutions, such as duplicating
the e-graph for each assumption, are available, but they are notably
resource-intensive.
  We introduce a key observation is that each duplicate e-graph (with an added
assumption) corresponds to coarsened congruence relation. Based on that, we
present an extension to e-graphs, called Colored E-Graphs, as a way to
represent all of the coarsened congruence relations in a single structure. A
colored e-graph is a memory-efficient equivalent of multiple copies of an
e-graph, with a much lower overhead. This is attained by sharing as much as
possible between different cases, while carefully tracking which conclusion is
true under which assumption. Support for multiple relations can be thought of
as adding multiple ""color-coded"" layers on top of the original e-graph
structure, leading to a large degree of sharing.
  In our implementation, we introduce optimizations to rebuilding and
e-matching. We run experiments and demonstrate that our colored e-graphs can
support hundreds of assumptions and millions of terms with space requirements

years. The core issue for learning feature matching is to how to learn (1)
discriminative representations for feature points (or regions) within each
intra-image and (2) consensus representations for feature points across
inter-images. Recently, self- and cross-attention models have been exploited to
address this issue. However, in many scenes, features are coming with
large-scale, redundant and outliers contaminated. Previous
self-/cross-attention models generally conduct message passing on all primal
features which thus lead to redundant learning and high computational cost. To
mitigate limitations, inspired by recent seed matching methods, in this paper,
we propose a novel efficient Anchor Matching Transformer (AMatFormer) for the
feature matching problem. AMatFormer has two main aspects: First, it mainly
conducts self-/cross-attention on some anchor features and leverages these
anchor features as message bottleneck to learn the representations for all
primal features. Thus, it can be implemented efficiently and compactly. Second,
AMatFormer adopts a shared FFN module to further embed the features of two
images into the common domain and thus learn the consensus feature
representations for the matching problem. Experiments on several benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AMatFormer
matching approach.

counting (PMC). PMC asks to count solutions of a Boolean formula with respect
to a given set of projection variables, where multiple solutions that are
identical when restricted to the projection variables count as only one
solution. Inspired by the observation that the so-called ""treewidth"" is one of
the most prominent structural parameters, our algorithm utilizes small
treewidth of the primal graph of the input instance. More precisely, it runs in
time O(2^2k+4n2) where k is the treewidth and n is the input size of the
instance. In other words, we obtain that the problem PMC is fixed-parameter
tractable when parameterized by treewidth. Further, we take the exponential
time hypothesis (ETH) into consideration and establish lower bounds of bounded
treewidth algorithms for PMC, yielding asymptotically tight runtime bounds of
our algorithm. While the algorithm above serves as a first theoretical upper
bound and although it might be quite appealing for small values of k,
unsurprisingly a naive implementation adhering to this runtime bound suffers
already from instances of relatively small width. Therefore, we turn our
attention to several measures in order to resolve this issue towards exploiting
treewidth in practice: We present a technique called nested dynamic
programming, where different levels of abstractions of the primal graph are
used to (recursively) compute and refine tree decompositions of a given
instance. Finally, we provide a nested dynamic programming algorithm and an
implementation that relies on database technology for PMC and a prominent
special case of PMC, namely model counting (#Sat). Experiments indicate that
the advancements are promising, allowing us to solve instances of treewidth
upper bounds beyond 200.

Based on the experimental and theoretical evidence, it is concluded that a
small concentration of Ag promotes the band flattening and induces a sharp
resonate-like state deep inside the valence band of Sb$_2$Te$_3$, concurrently
modifying the density of states (DOS) of the composite sample. In addition, the
electrical potential barrier introduced by the band offset between the host TE

scattering in the composite sample, which is also responsible for enhanced TE
performance. A contemporary approach based on scanning thermal microscopy is
performed to experimentally obtain thermal conductivity values of both the
in-plane and cross-plane directions, showing a reduced in-plane thermal
conductivity value by ~ 58% upon incorporating the AgSbTe$_2$ phase in the

The goal of the adversary is to misguide the online learning to rank algorithm
to place the target item on top of the ranking list linear times to time
horizon $T$ with a sublinear attack cost. We propose generalized list poisoning
attacks that perturb the ranking list presented to the user. This strategy can
efficiently attack any no-regret ranker in general stochastic click models.
Furthermore, we propose a click poisoning-based strategy named attack-then-quit
that can efficiently attack two representative OLTR algorithms for stochastic
click models. We theoretically analyze the success and cost upper bound of the
two proposed methods. Experimental results based on synthetic and real-world
data further validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of the proposed
attack strategies.

TPSC fails to yield physical results deep in the renormalized classical regime

improved methods satisfy the Mermin-Wagner theorem and the Pauli principle. We
also show that they are valid in the renormalized classical regime of the 2D

temperature in the antiferromagnetic phase. We discuss some limitations of the
TPSC+ approach with regards to the violation of the f-sum rule and conservation

there is an increasing effort focused on developing algorithms and paradigms

their intentions and goals. Here we argue that alignment to human intent is
insufficient for safe AI systems and that preservation of long-term agency of
humans may be a more robust standard, and one that needs to be separated
explicitly and a priori during optimization. We argue that AI systems can
reshape human intention and discuss the lack of biological and psychological

platform to encode correlated many-body states, suited to perform time
evolution. However, accessing the regime of modeling long-time dynamics is
hampered by quantum noise. In this study we use the best of worlds: the
short-time dynamics is efficiently performed by MPSs, compiled into short-depth
quantum circuits followed by Trotter circuits run on a quantum computer. We
quantify the capacities of this hybrid classical-quantum scheme in terms of
fidelities and entanglement production taking into account a realistic noise

generalize well to novel styles and fall short in quality. We therefore
investigate a new approach, AlteredAvatar, that combines those two approaches
using the meta-learning framework. In the inner loop, the model learns to
optimize to match a single target style well; while in the outer loop, the
model learns to stylize efficiently across many styles. After training,
AlteredAvatar learns an initialization that can quickly adapt within a small
number of update steps to a novel style, which can be given using texts, a

this perspective, events whose graph of exclusivity are odd holes or antiholes
are the building blocks of contextuality. For any odd hole or antihole, any

specific contextuality scenarios. However, here we prove that, for any odd

to the conjecture that the quantum maxima for any of the building blocks cannot

whether a probability assignment is quantum is decidable, while whether a

several subtleties that may arise as a result of considering large

power-law tail, a double-exponential tail, and a doubly peaked distribution can
all be realized for the curvature perturbation in the single-field
non-attractor models of inflation. We thus show that there is a diverse zoo of

One-loop contributions proportional to the long wavelength tree-level power

overall model performance and its ability to simulate flood events,
particularly flash floods. Multi-scale signatures, which refer to hydrological
signatures computed at different temporal and/or spatial scales, and
distributed flood modeling, which accounts for spatial variability in input
variables and model parameters, are important concepts in hydrological
modeling. In this study, the potential of using multi-scale signatures is
explored to enhance multi-criteria calibration methods for spatially
distributed flood modeling, which remains considerable challenges. We present a
novel signatures and sensitivity-based calibration approach implemented into a
variational data assimilation algorithm capable to deal with high dimensional
spatially distributed hydrological optimization problems. It is tested on 141
flash flood prone catchments mostly located in the French Mediterranean region.
Our approach involves computing several signatures, including flood event
signatures, using an automated flood segmentation algorithm. We select suitable
signatures for constraining the model based on their global sensitivity with
the input parameters through global signature-based sensitivity analysis
(GSSA). We then perform two multi-criteria calibration strategies using the
selected signatures, including a single-objective optimization approach, which
transforms the multi-criteria problem into a single-objective function, and a
multi-objective optimization approach, which uses a simple additive weighting
method to select an optimal solution from the Pareto set. Our results show
significant improvements in both calibration and temporal validation metrics,
especially for flood signatures, demonstrating the robustness and delicacy of
our signatures-based calibration framework for enhancing flash flood

matter from a helium-rich (semi-)degenerate object, are potential progenitors
of thermonuclear supernovae and strong sources of persistent gravitational wave
radiation. For a long time, it has been believed that these systems cannot
descend from cataclysmic variables (CVs), at least not in large numbers,
because the initial conditions need to be fine-tuned and, even worse, the
resulting surface hydrogen abundance would be high enough to be detected which
contradicts a defining feature of AM CVn binaries.
  Aims. Here we show that both claimed weaknesses of the CV formation channel
for AM CVn binaries are model-dependent and rely on poorly constrained
assumptions for magnetic braking.
  Methods. We performed binary evolution simulations with the MESA code for
different combinations of post-common-envelope white dwarf and companion masses
as well as orbital periods assuming strong magnetic braking.
  Results. We found that AM CVn binaries with extremely-low surface hydrogen
abundances are one natural outcome of CV evolution if the donor star has
developed a non-negligible helium core prior to the onset of mass transfer. In
this case, after hydrogen envelope exhaustion during CV evolution, the donor
becomes degenerate and its surface hydrogen abundance substantially drops and
becomes undetectable. Our simulations also show that the CV formation channel
is able to explain the observed AM CVn binaries with very low mass and bloated
donor stars (Gaia14aae and ZTF J1637+49) which has not been demonstrated for
any alternative formation channel.
  Conclusions. CVs with evolved donors are likely the progenitors of at least a
fraction of AM CVn binaries.

combining the perturbation equations and projecting them onto spin-weighted

that the two potentials remain isospectral as in the non-rotating limit.
However, it is easy to demonstrate it only for a precise choice of the tortoise

Contrary to the fundamental and practical significance of the SDE, the precise
underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the impact

Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an in-plane magnetic field. We show that a small
orbital effect leads to the sign reversal of $\Delta J_c$ and a crossover of

transition, stabilizing a finite momentum Cooper pairing state called the
orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state, and results in the drastic
change of the SDE. Owing to the orbital effect, the field dependence of the SDE
may show oscillations several times. The results shed light on the mechanism of
the SDE in atomically-thin multilayer superconductors.

below 1-2%. We apply this method to data from the Optical Gravitational Lensing

Galactic center of $R_0$ = $8108\pm106_{\rm stat}\pm93_{\rm sys}$ pc,
consistent with astrometric monitoring of stars orbiting Sgr A*. We cross-match
our distance catalog with Gaia DR3 and use the subset of $39,566$ overlapping
stars to provide the first constraints on the Milky Way's velocity field
($V_R,V_\phi,V_z$) beyond the Galactic center. We show that the $V_R$
quadrupole from the bar's near side is reflected with respect to the Galactic

disk, and therefore dynamically settled along its full extent. We also find
that the vertical height $V_Z$ map has no major structure in the region of the
Galactic bulge, which is inconsistent with a current episode of bar buckling.
Finally, we demonstrate with N-body simulations that distance uncertainty plays
a major factor in the alignment of the major and kinematic axes of the bar and

magnetic flux from the turbulent convection zone. Here, we report
state-of-the-art numerical simulations of magnetic flux emergence from the deep
convection zone. By controlling the twist of emerging flux, we find that with
the support of convective upflow, the untwisted emerging flux can reach the
solar surface without collapsing, in contrast to previous theoretical
predictions, and eventually create sunspots. Because of the turbulent twisting
of magnetic flux, the produced sunspots exhibit rotation and inject magnetic
helicity into the upper atmosphere, amounting to a substantial fraction of
injected helicity in the twisted cases that is sufficient to produce flare
eruptions. This result indicates that the turbulent convection is responsible
for supplying a non-negligible amount of magnetic helicity and potentially
contributes to solar flares.

on the amplitude of the variability with a clear correspondence between the
shape of the cocoon and the historical activity. The jet advances quickly
during high-power states, whereas quiescent periods instead produce passive
periods of inflation resembling Sedov-Taylor blast waves. Periods of high
activity preferentially produce hotspots and create stronger backflow as they
maximise the pressure gradient between the jet head and cocoon. The variability
can also lead to propagating internal shock structures along the jet. Our work
suggests that variability and flickering in the jet power has important
implications, which we discuss, for observations of radio galaxies, ultrahigh
energy cosmic ray acceleration and jet power to luminosity correlations. We
explore the link between morphology and fuelling, and suggest that chaotic cold
accretion should introduce a relatively small scatter in radio luminosity
($\sim0.2$ dex) and modest imprints on morphology; sources such as Hercules A
and Fornax A, which show evidence for more dramatic variability, may therefore
require redder power spectra, or be triggered by mergers or other discrete

Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) images dominated by dust emission. Rest-MIR
S\'ersic indices are only measured for the brightest MIRI sources ($S/N>75$; 38

S\'ersic index of bright galaxies ($S/N>75$) has a median value of 0.7, which,
together with their axis ratio distribution, suggests a disk-like morphology in
the rest-MIR. Galaxies above the main sequence (MS; i.e., starbursts) have
rest-MIR sizes that are a factor 2 smaller than their rest-optical sizes. The
median rest-optical to rest-MIR size ratio of MS galaxies increases with
stellar mass, from 1.1 at $10^{9.8}M_\odot$ to 1.6 at $10^{11}M_\odot$. This
mass-dependent trend resembles the one found in the literature between the
rest-optical and rest-near-infrared sizes of SFGs, suggesting that it is due to
dust attenuation gradients affecting rest-optical sizes and that the sizes of
the stellar and star-forming components of SFGs are, on average, consistent at
all masses. There is, however, a small population of SFGs (15%) with a compact
star-forming component embedded in a larger stellar structure. This could be

of gravitational self-force models of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. In the most

parallel tempering), which proposes appropriate swaps between exploration and
exploitation to achieve accelerations. However, the na\""ive extension of swaps
to big data problems leads to a large bias, and bias-corrected swaps are
required. Such a mechanism leads to few effective swaps and insignificant
accelerations. To alleviate this issue, we first propose a control variates

  detection and characterisation: Young gas giants in emission","Accepted for publication in A&A",,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context: Combining high-contrast imaging with medium- or high-resolution
integral field spectroscopy has the potential to boost the detection rate of
exoplanets, especially at small angular separations. Furthermore, it
immediately provides a spectrum of the planet that can be used to characterise
its atmosphere. The achievable spectral resolution, wavelength coverage, and
FOV of such an instrument are limited by the number of available detector
pixels. Methods: The trade-offs are studied through end-to-end simulations of a
typical high-contrast imaging instrument, analytical considerations, and
atmospheric retrievals. The results are then validated with archival
VLT/SINFONI data of the planet beta Pictoris b. Results: We show that molecular
absorption spectra generally have decreasing power towards higher spectral
resolution and that molecule mapping is already powerful for moderate
resolutions (R>300). When choosing between wavelength coverage and spectral
resolution for a given number of spectral bins, it is best to first increase
the spectral resolution until R~2,000 and then maximise the bandwidth within an
observing band. We find that T-type companions are most easily detected in the
J/H band through methane and water features, while L-type companions are best
observed in the H/K band through water and CO features. Such an instrument does
not need to have a large FOV, as most of the gain in contrast is obtained in
the speckle-limited regime close to the star. We show that the same conclusions
are valid for the constraints on atmospheric parameters such as the C/O ratio,
metallicity, surface gravity, and temperature, while higher spectral resolution
(R~10,000) is required to constrain the radial velocity and spin of the planet.

considerable interest in studying the properties of model activations. The
literature overwhelmingly agrees that LLM representations are dominated by a
few ``outlier dimensions'' with exceedingly high variance and magnitude.
Several studies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have sought to mitigate
the impact of such outlier dimensions and force LLMs to be isotropic (i.e.,
have uniform variance across all dimensions in embedding space). Isotropy is
thought to be a desirable property for LLMs that improves model performance and
more closely aligns textual representations with human intuition. However, many
of the claims regarding isotropy in NLP have been based on the average cosine
similarity of embeddings, which has recently been shown to be a flawed measure
of isotropy. In this paper, we propose I-STAR: IsoScore$^{\star}$-based STable
Anisotropic Regularization, a novel regularization method that can be used to
increase or decrease levels of isotropy in embedding space during training.
I-STAR uses IsoScore$^{\star}$, the first accurate measure of isotropy that is

several previous works, we find that \textit{decreasing} isotropy in

solutions of hyperbolic PDEs were not available yet on unstructured meshes. In
this paper, we extend high order fast sweeping methods to unstructured
triangular meshes by applying fixed-point iterative sweeping techniques to a
fifth-order finite volume unstructured WENO scheme, for solving steady state
solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws. An advantage of fixed-point fast
sweeping methods which distinguishes them from other fast sweeping methods is
that they are explicit and do not require inverse operation of nonlinear local
systems. As in the first order fast sweeping methods on triangular meshes, we
introduce multiple reference points to determine alternating sweeping
directions on unstructured meshes. All the cells on the mesh are ordered
according to their centroids' distances to those reference points, and the
resulted orderings provide sweeping directions for iterations. To make the
residue of the fast sweeping iterations converge to machine zero / round off
errors, we follow the approach in our early work of developing the absolutely
convergent fixed-point fast sweeping WENO methods on rectangular meshes, and
adopt high order WENO scheme with unequal-sized sub-stencils for spatial
discretization. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to show the
accuracy, computational efficiency, and absolute convergence of the presented
fifth-order fast sweeping scheme on triangular meshes. Furthermore, the
proposed method is compared with the forward Euler method and the popular third
order total variation diminishing Rung-Kutta method for steady state
computations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast
sweeping WENO method is the most efficient scheme among them, and especially it
can save up to 70% CPU time costs than TVD-RK3 to converge to steady state

diagnostic codes and procedure reports which revealed information about
different phenotypes related to various perspectives about heart failure, to
study patients' profiles and to discover new relationships among medical
concepts. Each theme had a set of keywords and each clinical note was labeled
with two themes - one corresponding to its diagnostic code and the other
corresponding to its procedure reports along with their percentage
contribution. We used these themes and their percentage contribution to predict
length of stay. We found that the themes discovered in diagnostic codes and
procedure reports using topic modeling together were able to predict length of
stay of the patients with an accuracy of 61.1% and an Area under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC) value of 0.828.

find that people and the program induction model can make a range of meaningful
compositional generalizations, with the model providing a strong account of the

rotation and changing part attachment). In few shot generation tasks, both
people and the models are able to construct compelling novel examples, with
people behaving in additional structured ways beyond the model capabilities,
e.g. making choices that complete a set or reconfiguring existing parts in
highly novel ways. To capture these additional behavioral patterns, we develop
an alternative model based on neuro-symbolic program induction: this model also
composes new concepts from existing parts yet, distinctively, it utilizes
neural network modules to successfully capture residual statistical structure.
Together, our behavioral and computational findings show how people and models

random forest (RF) performance regression models with a weighted average of
algorithms' performance on training problems that are considered similar to a
test problem. More precisely, in this RF+clust approach, the weights are chosen
proportionally to the distances of the problems in some feature space. Here in
this work, we extend the RF+clust approach by adjusting the distance-based
weights with the importance of the features for performance regression. That
is, instead of considering cosine distance in the feature space, we consider a
weighted distance measure, with weights depending on the relevance of the
feature for the regression model. Our empirical evaluation of the modified
RF+clust approach on the CEC 2014 benchmark suite confirms its advantages over
the naive distance measure. However, we also observe room for improvement, in

For this purpose, we unify three interrelated concepts of overparameterization,

arteriotomies for femoral endarterectomy with patch angioplasty is a novel

The patient underwent a standard femoral endarterectomy. Prior to patch
angioplasty, a 4.2 mm coronary vascular punch was used to created proximal and
distal circular arteriotomies. The idealized artery was modeled as a 9 mm
cylinder with a central slit. The vertices of the slit were modeled as: a sharp
V consistent with traditional linear arteriotomy, circular punched hole, and
beveled punched hole. The artery was pressurized to achieve displacement
consistent with the size of a common femoral artery prior to patch angioplasty.
Maximum von Mises stress, area-averaged stress, and stress concentration
factors were evaluated for all three models. Results: Maximum von Mises stress
was 0.098 MPa with 5 mm of displacement and increased to 0.26 MPa with 10 mm of
displacement. Maximum stress in the uniform circular model was 0.019 MPa and
0.018 with a beveled notch. Average stress was lowest in the circular punch
model at 0.006 MP and highest in the linear V notch arteriotomy at 0.010 MPa.
Stress concentration factor was significantly lower in both circular models
compared with the V notch. Conclusions: Femoral endarterectomy modified with
the creation of circular arteriotomies is a safe and effective surgical
technique. Finite element modeling revealed reduced maximum von Mises stress
and average stress at the vertices of a circular or beveled punch arteriotomy
compared with a linear, V shaped arteriotomy. Reduced vertex stress may promote
lower risk of restenosis.

between the top and bottom of a thin film, made possible by coating their lower
surfaces with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Such designs, though successful, were
limited due to their high thermal emissivity (>0.5), which prevented them from
achieving high temperatures and resulted in their transferring relatively low
amounts of momentum to the surrounding gas. To address this issue, we have
developed light-flyers with undoped germanium layers that selectively absorb
nearly 80% of visible light but are mostly transparent in the thermal infrared,
with an average thermal emissivity of <0.1. Our experiments show that
germanium-coated light-flyers could levitate at up to 43% lower light
irradiances than mylar-CNT disks with identical sizes. In addition, we
simulated our experiments using a combined first-principles-empirical model,
allowing us to predict that our 2-cm-diameter disk-shaped germanium-coated
light-flyers can levitate in the mesosphere (altitudes 68-78 km) under the
natural sunlight (1.36 kW/m2). Similar ultrathin selective-absorber coatings
can also be applied to three-dimensional light-flyers shaped like solar

Landau state that supplements the conventional Landau quasiparticle picture
with a different set of quasiparticles, the so-called fermion condensate, whose
single-particle spectrum is dispersionless. The celebrated Landau-Luttinger
theorem can then be extended to marginal Fermi liquids, in which the density of

quantum protocols, and is exciting for its relation to issues in foundational
physics. The quantum SWITCH is also an example of a higher-order quantum
operation, in that it not only transforms quantum states, but also other
quantum operations. To date, no higher-order quantum operation has been
completely experimentally characterized. Indeed, past work on the quantum
SWITCH has confirmed its ICO by measuring causal witnesses or demonstrating
resource advantages, but the complete process matrix has only been described
theoretically. Here, we perform higher-order quantum process tomography.
However, doing so requires exponentially many measurements with a scaling worse
than standard process tomography. We overcome this challenge by creating a new
passively-stable fiber-based quantum SWITCH using active optical elements to
deterministically generate and manipulate time-bin encoded qubits. Moreover,
our new architecture for the quantum SWITCH can be readily scaled to multiple
parties. By reconstructing the process matrix, we estimate its fidelity and
tailor different causal witnesses directly for our experiment. To achieve this,
we measure a set of tomographically complete settings, that also spans the
input operation space. Our tomography protocol allows for the characterization

our experimental time-bin techniques could enable the creation of a new realm

optical depth at 0.5\,keV in the simulation reaches $0.15\pm0.07$, while the

account for a significant fraction of the observed opacity. The remaining

adjust model parameters, and a growing literature in computational neuroscience
leverages these ideas to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the
vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice
of distance for synaptic changes (i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity).
Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other
distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses
Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror
descent, we show that, regardless of the loss being minimized, the distribution
of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use
these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight
distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard
gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with non-Euclidean
distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test
for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions
before and after learning. Overall, this work shows that the current paradigm
in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic
geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally
determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.

applications where training data can contain incorrect or corrupted labels.
When fine-tuning language models with noisy labels, models can easily overfit
the label noise, leading to decreased performance. Most existing methods for
learning from noisy labels use static input features for denoising, but these
methods are limited by the information they can provide on true label
distributions and can result in biased or incorrect predictions. In this work,
we propose the Dynamics-Enhanced Generative Model (DyGen), which uses dynamic
patterns in the embedding space during the fine-tuning process of language
models to improve noisy label predictions. DyGen uses the variational
auto-encoding framework to infer the posterior distributions of true labels
from noisy labels and training dynamics. Additionally, a co-regularization
mechanism is used to minimize the impact of potentially noisy labels and
priors. DyGen demonstrates an average accuracy improvement of 3.10% on two
synthetic noise datasets and 1.48% on three real-world noise datasets compared
to the previous state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments and analyses show the
effectiveness of each component in DyGen. Our code is available for

with a local oscillator (LO) on a beam splitter (BS). Good quadrature
measurements require a high-amplitude LO and two high-efficiency photodiodes
whose signals are subtracted and normalized. By changing the LO phase, it is
then possible to infer the optical state in the mode matching the LO. For
quantum information processing, the states of interest are in well-separated
modes, corresponding to a pulsed configuration with one relevant LO mode per
measurement. We theoretically investigate what can be learned about the unknown
optical state by counting photons in one or both outgoing paths after the BS,
keeping the LO mode fixed but choosing its phase and magnitude. We consider
measurement configurations where the BS acts differently on different sets of
matching modes. When the BS acts identically on all matching modes it is
possible to determine the content of the unknown optical state in the mode
matching the LO conditional on each number of photons in the orthogonal modes
on the same path. In particular, if both the phase and the intensity of the LO
can be varied, then the statistics of just one of the counters is enough to
infer these parameters, while in the case of an LO with fixed intensity both
detectors are needed to accomplish this. Our results are derived by
demonstrating a bijection, or lack thereof, between the probability
distributions over the space of outcomes of the counter(s) and certain
parameters of the unknown state for different measurement configuration. We
report an experiment that was conducted to demonstrate the theory in the case
where the BS acts differently depending on the polarization.

upon reaching the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to

pursuers are faster than the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign
each pursuer to virtual target and evader such that the the pursuer team's
energy is minimized, and second, choose the the virtual targets' locations for
this minimization problem. The approach taken is to consider the Apollonius
geometry between each pursuer's virtual target location and each evader. Using
the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer's travel distance and maneuver
at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a gauge for the total

$\gamma$ tunes the vessel growth in the adaptation rule, and we test the

of the previous studies have focused on interpreting spectral data with 1D

global circulation, we applied a 2D photochemical model and a 2D microphysical
cloud model separately to post-process the thermal and dynamical structures
simulated by a 3D general circulation model (GCM) of WASP-39b. We found that
SO$_2$ produced by photochemistry on the dayside can be transported to the
nightside owing to the efficient replenishment of horizontal transport. The
morning-evening limb differences in methane (CH$_4$) abundances predicted by
the 1D models disappeared after horizontal transport is included. Similarly,
the inclusion of horizontal transport also reduced the limb differences in
SO$_2$. Our modeling results suggest that the fast zonal wind results in
minimal or negligible limb asymmetry in composition. Based on the synthetic
spectra generated by our 2D atmosphere simulations, we propose that observing
SO$_2$ absorption in the emission spectra of WASP-39b at different phases may
offer opportunities to probe the horizontal quenching process of photochemical

the absence of training data in a source domain. To address these challenges,
in this work, we seek to progressively evolve an ``off-the-shelf"" trained

a unified manner. Specifically, we first propose a divergence-aware dual-flow

gender, racial, and ethnic minorities in clinical trials remains a problem and
undermines the efficacy of treatments on minorities. This paper focuses on the
trial site selection task and proposes FRAMM, a deep reinforcement learning
framework for fair trial site selection. We focus on addressing two real-world
challenges that affect fair trial sites selection: the data modalities are
often not complete for many potential trial sites, and the site selection needs
to simultaneously optimize for both enrollment and diversity since the problem
is necessarily a trade-off between the two with the only possible way to
increase diversity post-selection being through limiting enrollment via caps.
To address the missing data challenge, FRAMM has a modality encoder with a
masked cross-attention mechanism for handling missing data, bypassing data
imputation and the need for complete data in training. To handle the need for
making efficient trade-offs, FRAMM uses deep reinforcement learning with a
specifically designed reward function that simultaneously optimizes for both
enrollment and fairness.
  We evaluate FRAMM using 4,392 real-world clinical trials ranging from 2016 to
2021 and show that FRAMM outperforms the leading baseline in enrollment-only
settings while also achieving large gains in diversity. Specifically, it is
able to produce a 9% improvement in diversity with similar enrollment levels
over the leading baselines. That improved diversity is further manifested in
achieving up to a 14% increase in Hispanic enrollment, 27% increase in Black
enrollment, and 60% increase in Asian enrollment compared to selecting sites

assumed mechanism is inverse Compton upscattering of the Cosmic Microwave

jet. Under this mechanism, no variability in the X-ray emission is expected.
Here we report the detection of X-ray variability in the large-scale jet

Uniform (0,1) distribution. These results strongly imply that the dominant
mechanism of X-ray production in kpc-scale jets is synchrotron emission by a

on the time-scale of months to a few years implies extremely small emitting
volumes much smaller than the cross-section of the jet.

collected by the NA64-$e$ experiment in 2022. Our study is based on
calorimetric measurements, exploiting the different interaction mechanisms of
electrons and hadrons in the NA64-ECAL and NA64-HCAL detectors. We determined
the intrinsic hadronic contamination by comparing the results obtained using
the nominal electron/positron beamline configuration with those obtained in a
dedicated setup, in which only hadrons impinged on the detector. The
significant differences in the experimental signatures of electrons and hadrons
motivated our approach, resulting in a small and well-controlled systematic
uncertainty for the measurement. Our study allowed us to precisely determine
the intrinsic hadronic contamination, which represents a crucial parameter for
the NA64 experiment in which the hadron contaminants may result in non-trivial
backgrounds. Moreover, we performed dedicated Monte Carlo simulations for the
hadron production induced by the primary T2 target. We found a good agreement
between measurements and simulation results, confirming the validity of the
applied methodology and our evaluation of the intrinsic hadronic contamination.

Distillation (KD) for small-kernel ConvNets. While Transformers have led
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in various fields with ever-larger models
and labeled data, small-kernel ConvNets are considered more suitable for
resource-limited applications due to the efficient convolution operation and
compact weight sharing. KD is widely used to boost the performance of
small-kernel ConvNets. However, previous research shows that it is not quite
effective to distill knowledge (e.g., global information) from Transformers to
small-kernel ConvNets, presumably due to their disparate architectures. We
hereby carry out a first-of-its-kind study unveiling that modern large-kernel
ConvNets, a compelling competitor to Vision Transformers, are remarkably more
effective teachers for small-kernel ConvNets, due to more similar
architectures. Our findings are backed up by extensive experiments on both
logit-level and feature-level KD ``out of the box"", with no dedicated
architectural nor training recipe modifications. Notably, we obtain the
\textbf{best-ever pure ConvNet} under 30M parameters with \textbf{83.1\%} top-1
accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming current SOTA methods including ConvNeXt V2

as a powerful tool for designing the imaging protocols that are now routinely

barrier to therapeutic success in cancer. Resistance is often caused by genetic
alterations such as point mutation, which refers to the modification of a
single genomic base pair, or gene amplification, which refers to the
duplication of a region of DNA that contains a gene. Here we investigate the
dependence of tumor recurrence dynamics on these mechanisms of resistance,
using stochastic multi-type branching process models. We derive tumor
extinction probabilities and deterministic estimates for the tumor recurrence
time, defined as the time when an initially drug sensitive tumor surpasses its
original size after developing resistance. For models of amplification-driven
and mutation-driven resistance, we prove law of large numbers results regarding
the convergence of the stochastic recurrence times to their mean. Additionally,
we prove sufficient and necessary conditions for a tumor to escape extinction
under the gene amplification model, discuss behavior under biologically
relevant parameters, and compare the recurrence time and tumor composition in
the mutation and amplification models both analytically and using simulations.
In comparing these mechanisms, we find that the ratio between recurrence times
driven by amplification vs. mutation depends linearly on the number of
amplification events required to acquire the same degree of resistance as a
mutation event, and we find that the relative frequency of amplification and
mutation events plays a key role in determining the mechanism under which
recurrence is more rapid. In the amplification-driven resistance model, we also
observe that increasing drug concentration leads to a stronger initial
reduction in tumor burden, but that the eventual recurrent tumor population is
less heterogeneous, more aggressive, and harbors higher levels of
drug-resistance.

scales in all directions. The jet forcing from four sides in the horizontal
direction guarantees isotropy in horizontal planes but leads to more energy in
the horizontal fluctuations compared with the vertical fluctuations. This
anisotropy between the horizontal and vertical fluctuations decreases at
smaller scales, so that the inertial and dissipation range statistics show
isotropic behaviour. Using four jet arrays allows us to achieve higher
turbulence intensity and Reynolds number with a shorter jet merging distance
compared to two facing arrays. We show that we are able to vary the turbulence
scales and Reynolds number by adding attachments to the exits of each jet and
changing the parameters of the algorithm that drives random-jet stirring. By
linking how the flow from each jet influences the random-jet-stirred

anisotropic optical response. As a result, the absorption spectra changes with
the polarization state of the incoming photons. To understand this phenomenon,
here we calculate the complete electromagnetic wave equation solutions as a
function of linear polarization angle and photon energy for
$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ using its measured complex dielectric function tensor.
The significant off-diagonal terms in this tensor result in a non-exponential
decay in the photon flux, indicating that the Beer-Lambert law is not generally
valid in this anisotropic material. However, over a limited spectral range (>
5.8 eV (001 plane),>5.2 eV (010 plane)) an effective absorption coefficient
well approximates the photon flux decay with depth. Near the optical absorption
edge (4.9 - 5.8 eV (001 plane),4.65 - 5.2 eV (010 plane)) the photon flux decay
exhibits a modified exponential decay, such that two effective absorption
coefficients are necessary to model the optical spectrum. Using these results,
we calculate the polarization-dependent photoresponsivity spectra for light
polarized along different crystallographic directions and find that a
significant sub-bandgap photoresponse occurs spanning into the solar spectrum.
Truly solar-blind photoresponsivity is only possible if the light is linear
polarized along the [010] direction as compared to (010) plane of
$\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$.

very efficient star formation in high-redshift galaxies suggested by recent
JWST observations. We investigate possible observational signatures of their
formation stage, particularly when the mass of a cluster is increasing via
accretion from a natal molecular cloud. To this end, we study the broad-band
continuum emission from ionized gas and dust enshrouding YMCs, whose formation
is followed by recent radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We perform
post-process radiative transfer calculations using simulation snapshots and
find characteristic spectral features at radio and far-infrared frequencies. We
show that a striking feature is long-lasting, strong free-free emission from a
$\sim$ 10pc-scale HII region with a large emission measure of $\gtrsim 10^7
\mathrm{cm}^{-6} \ \mathrm{pc}$, corresponding to the mean electron density of
$\gtrsim 10^3~\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. There is a turnover feature below $\sim$ 10
GHz, a signature of the optically-thick free-free emission, often found in
Galactic ultra-compact HII regions. These features come from the peculiar YMC
formation process, where the cluster's gravity effectively traps photoionized
gas for a long duration and enables continuous star formation within the
cluster. Such large and dense HII regions show distinct distribution on the
density-size diagram, apart from the standard sequence of Galactic HII regions.
This is consistent with the observational trend inferred for extragalactic HII

that explicitly leverages the flexibility of Matryoshka Representations. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-compute trade-offs using novel
AdANNS-based key ANNS building blocks like search data structures (AdANNS-IVF)
and quantization (AdANNS-OPQ). For example on ImageNet retrieval, AdANNS-IVF is
up to 1.5% more accurate than the rigid representations-based IVF at the same
compute budget; and matches accuracy while being up to 90x faster in wall-clock
time. For Natural Questions, 32-byte AdANNS-OPQ matches the accuracy of the
64-byte OPQ baseline constructed using rigid representations -- same accuracy
at half the cost! We further show that the gains from AdANNS translate to
modern-day composite ANNS indices that combine search structures and
quantization. Finally, we demonstrate that AdANNS can enable inference-time
adaptivity for compute-aware search on ANNS indices built non-adaptively on

questions remain unanswered, which has led to an active research program to
search for either rare SM phenomena or Beyond Standard Model (BSM) physics that
involve the Higgs boson. In this dissertation, I present two example searches
involving the Higgs boson, using proton-proton ($pp$) collision data collected
by the ATLAS detector. The first search tackles the problem of how the SM Higgs
couples to the second-generation fermions. It searches for the dimuon decay of
the SM Higgs boson using data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139
fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13\
\mathrm{TeV}$ at the LHC. In the second search, we look for Dark Matter
produced in association with a Higgs boson decaying to $b$-quarks. This search
uses the same dataset as the $H\to\mu\mu$ search and targets events that
contain large missing transverse momentum and either two $b$-tagged
small-radius jets or a single large-radius jet associated with two $b$-tagged
subjets. In addition to the two physics analyses, unfolding is a key procedure
in the high energy experiments, which corrects data for the detector effect. I
present a new unfolding method that allows to unfold data without having any
artificial binning and is also able to profile nuisance parameters
simultaneously. This new method provides much higher flexibility and increases
the reusability for different downstream tasks compared to the traditional

  Applications","Accepted to IEEE ICIT 2023",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  5G brings many improvements to cellular networks in terms of performance,
such as lower latency, improved network efficiency, and higher throughput,
making it an attractive candidate for many applications. One such domain is
industrial applications that may require real-time guarantees to transmit
time-critical control messages. Assuming the immense number of devices
exchanging data in support of Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC)
applications, the capability of the cellular infrastructure to handle a large
number of real-time transmissions may be inadequate. For such cases, there
exists an acute desire to reduce any overheads as much as possible in order to
guarantee certain deadlines. One such target is the Domain Name System (DNS)
service, for which queries precede almost every new network request. This
incorporates additional communication delays based on the response time, which
in turn is affected by the proximity of the DNS server. While bringing DNS
service to the edge has been touted as a logical solution, its integration with
5G systems is still challenging. This is due to the inability to access the DNS
query information at the application layer since the User Equipment (UE)
traffic is tunneled through to the core network. To this end, we propose a
novel approach that can identify DNS queries at the base stations through
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) capabilities. Specifically, we develop an SDN
controller which is used to identify and extract DNS queries at the base
station and handle the query at the edge without going through the 5G core
network. This approach was implemented in a virtualized 5G network, in which we
demonstrate that it is feasible and can potentially bring significant
performance gains, especially in the case of mMTC applications.

preferences of $n$ agents over a set of $m$ alternatives and output a single

to the voting rule is each agent's ranking of the alternatives from most to
least preferred, yet the agents have more refined (cardinal) preferences that
capture the intensity with which they prefer one alternative over another. To
quantify the extent to which voting rules can optimize over the cardinal
preferences given access only to the ordinal ones, prior work has used the
distortion measure, i.e., the worst-case approximation ratio between a voting
rule's performance and the best performance achievable given the cardinal
preferences.
  The work on the distortion of voting rules has been largely divided into two
worlds: utilitarian distortion and metric distortion. In the former, the
cardinal preferences of the agents correspond to general utilities and the goal
is to maximize a normalized social welfare. In the latter, the agents' cardinal
preferences correspond to costs given by distances in an underlying metric
space and the goal is to minimize the (unnormalized) social cost. Several
deterministic and randomized voting rules have been proposed and evaluated for
each of these worlds separately, gradually improving the achievable distortion
bounds, but none of the known voting rules perform well in both worlds
simultaneously.
  In this work, we prove that one can achieve the best of both worlds by
designing new voting rules, that simultaneously achieve near-optimal distortion
guarantees in both distortion worlds. We also prove that this positive result
does not generalize to the case where the voting rule is provided with the
rankings of only the top-$t$ alternatives of each agent, for $t<m$.

its tantalizing saving potential for the entire training process as well as
inference. Dynamic sparse training (DST), as a leading sparse training
approach, can train deep neural networks at high sparsity from scratch to match
the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most if not all DST prior
arts demonstrate their effectiveness on unstructured sparsity with highly
irregular sparse patterns, which receives limited support in common hardware.
This limitation hinders the usage of DST in practice. In this paper, we propose
Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase), which for the first time seamlessly
translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly
channel-level sparsity (not fine-grained N:M or group sparsity) during one
end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations. The resulting small
sparse networks can be directly accelerated by commodity hardware, without
using any particularly sparsity-aware hardware accelerators. This appealing
outcome is partially motivated by a hidden phenomenon of dynamic sparsity:
off-the-shelf unstructured DST implicitly involves biased parameter
reallocation across channels, with a large fraction of channels (up to 60\%)
being sparser than others. By progressively identifying and removing these
channels during training, our approach translates unstructured sparsity to
channel-wise sparsity. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chase achieves
1.7 X inference throughput speedup on common GPU devices without compromising
accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet. We release our codes in

deterministic dynamics, the phase space distribution is unknown, making the
dissipation function difficult to evaluate without extra information. As such,
steady state FTs for deterministic systems to date have required either that
the trajectory segment of interest is relatively long, or that information is
available about the entire trajectory surrounding that segment. In this work,
it is shown that a simple machine learning model trained to predict whether a
given steady state trajectory segment is being played forward or backward in
time calculates a function that satisfies an FT and relies solely on
information within the segment of interest. The FT is satisfied even for very
short trajectory segments where the approximate relation derived from theory
breaks down, for systems far from equilibrium, and for various nonequilibrium

and that a local FT can be derived which depends only on local dissipation and
its correlations with the surrounding non-local dissipation.

performance as they fail to capture the interdependence between these tasks. To
address this problem, we propose a unified audio-visual learning framework

task-specific decoders trained with three objectives. The first objective
aligns audio and visual representations through a localized audio-visual

traditional mix-and-separate framework. Finally, the third objective reinforces
visual feature separation and localization by mixing images in pixel space and
aligning their representations with those of all corresponding sound sources.

substructures located in the southern periphery of the LMC, we find more
complex chemical and kinematical signatures, indicative of a mix of LMC-like

better agreement with the LMC, whereas that closest to the SMC shows a much

sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of
Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified
as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of
different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In
this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length
generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different
position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's
Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional
encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and
mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional
encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for
length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms
other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional
computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute
and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative
PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful
to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's
performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are
not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer
sequences.

simplifies radiation therapy treatment planning by eliminating the need for CT
simulation and error-prone image registration, ultimately reducing patient

denoising diffusion probabilistic model (MC-DDPM) to transform MRI into
high-quality sCT to facilitate radiation treatment planning. MC-DDPM implements
diffusion processes with a shifted-window transformer network to generate sCT
from MRI. The proposed model consists of two processes: a forward process which
adds Gaussian noise to real CT scans, and a reverse process in which a
shifted-window transformer V-net (Swin-Vnet) denoises the noisy CT scans
conditioned on the MRI from the same patient to produce noise-free CT scans.
With an optimally trained Swin-Vnet, the reverse diffusion process was used to
generate sCT scans matching MRI anatomy. We evaluated the proposed method by
generating sCT from MRI on a brain dataset and a prostate dataset. Qualitative
evaluation was performed using the mean absolute error (MAE) of Hounsfield unit
(HU), peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), multi-scale Structure Similarity index
(MS-SSIM) and normalized cross correlation (NCC) indexes between ground truth
CTs and sCTs. MC-DDPM generated brain sCTs with state-of-the-art quantitative
results with MAE 43.317 HU, PSNR 27.046 dB, SSIM 0.965, and NCC 0.983. For the
prostate dataset, MC-DDPM achieved MAE 59.953 HU, PSNR 26.920 dB, SSIM 0.849,

for generating CT images from routine MRIs using a transformer-based DDPM. This
model effectively captures the complex relationship between CT and MRI images,

The material properties of solid gold may affect the generation and transport

With the increase of the charge state of Au ions, the laser-plasma interaction
transfers to the later stage, resulting in a decrease in laser energy
absorption rate. Collision has both beneficial and harmful effects. On one
hand, collision provides a thermal pressure that makes it easier for electrons
to escape into the potential well in front of the target and be accelerated in
the second stage. On the other hand, collision increases stopping power and
suppress electron recirculation within the target in the third stage. The
vacuum sheath field behind the target enhances the electron circulation inside
the target and thus improves the laser energy absorption, however this effect
will be suppressed when the blow-off plasma density behind the target increases

develop symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the implicit

years has resulted in a significant number of different notions of fairness.
Despite the fact that these notions are well-justified, they are often
motivated and studied in a disjoint manner where one fairness desideratum is
considered exclusively in isolation from the others. This leaves the
understanding of the relations between different fairness notions as an
important open problem in fair clustering. In this paper, we take the first
step in this direction. Specifically, we consider the two most prominent
demographic representation fairness notions in clustering: (1) Group Fairness
(GF), where the different demographic groups are supposed to have close to
population-level representation in each cluster and (2) Diversity in Center
Selection (DS), where the selected centers are supposed to have close to
population-level representation of each group. We show that given a constant
approximation algorithm for one constraint (GF or DS only) we can obtain a
constant approximation solution that satisfies both constraints simultaneously.
Interestingly, we prove that any given solution that satisfies the GF
constraint can always be post-processed at a bounded degradation to the
clustering cost to additionally satisfy the DS constraint while the reverse is
not true. Furthermore, we show that both GF and DS are incompatible (having an
empty feasibility set in the worst case) with a collection of other
distance-based fairness notions. Finally, we carry experiments to validate our
theoretical findings.

state distribution, i.e., state entropy, by encouraging uniform coverage of
visited state space. While it has been effective for an unsupervised setup, it
tends to struggle in a supervised setup with a task reward, where an agent
prefers to visit high-value states to exploit the task reward. Such a
preference can cause an imbalance between the distributions of high-value
states and low-value states, which biases exploration towards low-value state
regions as a result of the state entropy increasing when the distribution
becomes more uniform. This issue is exacerbated when high-value states are
narrowly distributed within the state space, making it difficult for the agent
to complete the tasks. In this paper, we present a novel exploration technique
that maximizes the value-conditional state entropy, which separately estimates
the state entropies that are conditioned on the value estimates of each state,
then maximizes their average. By only considering the visited states with
similar value estimates for computing the intrinsic bonus, our method prevents
the distribution of low-value states from affecting exploration around
high-value states, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the proposed alternative

performs to compromise network assets and acquire privileges through exploiting
network vulnerabilities. Attack path analysis helps organizations to identify
new/unknown chains of attack vectors that reach critical assets within the
network, as opposed to individual attack vectors in signature-based attack
analysis. Timely identification of attack paths enables proactive mitigation of
threats. Nevertheless, manual analysis of complex network configurations,
vulnerabilities, and security events to identify attack paths is rarely
feasible. This work proposes a novel transferable graph neural network-based
model for shortest path identification. The proposed shortest path detection
approach, integrated with a novel holistic and comprehensive model for
identifying potential network vulnerabilities interactions, is then utilized to
detect network attack paths. Our framework automates the risk assessment of
attack paths indicating the propensity of the paths to enable the compromise of
highly-critical assets (e.g., databases) given the network configuration,
assets' criticality, and the severity of the vulnerabilities in-path to the
asset. The proposed framework, named SPGNN-API, incorporates automated threat
mitigation through a proactive timely tuning of the network firewall rules and
zero-trust policies to break critical attack paths and bolster cyber defenses.
Our evaluation process is twofold; evaluating the performance of the shortest
path identification and assessing the attack path detection accuracy. Our
results show that SPGNN-API largely outperforms the baseline model for shortest
path identification with an average accuracy >= 95% and successfully detects
100% of the potentially compromised assets, outperforming the attack graph

the nearby (D$<$30 Mpc) Universe, show a notable X-ray emission deficiency (up
to a factor of $\sim$10) compared with predictions from scaling relations of
galaxy-wide high mass X-ray binary (HMXB) luminosity with star-formation rate.
In the nearby ($\approx$20 Mpc) LIRG NGC 7552, the majority of the IR emission
originates in a circumnuclear starburst ring, which has been resolved into
several discrete knots of star formation. We present results from recent
Chandra observations of NGC 7552, which reveal significant deficits in the 2-7
keV X-ray luminosities from two of the most powerful star-forming knots. We
hypothesize that the expected luminous HMXB populations in these knots are
either (1) obscured by very large column densities or (2) suppressed due to the
knots having relatively high metallicity and/or very young ages ($\lesssim$ 5
Myr). We distinguish between these possibilities using data from recent NuSTAR
observations, whose sensitivity above 10 keV is capable of uncovering heavily
obscured HMXB populations, since emission at these energies is more immune to
absorption effects. We find no evidence of a heavily obscured HMXB population
in the central region of NGC 7552, suggesting suppressed HMXB formation. We
further show that metallicity-dependent scaling relations cannot fully account
for the observed deficit from the most powerful star-forming knots or the
central region as a whole. Thus, we suggest that recent bursts in local star
formation activity likely drive the high $L_{\rm{IR}}$ within these regions on
timescales $\lesssim$ 5 Myr, shorter than the timescale required for the
formation of HMXBs.

introduce a notion of {\it generalized equilibrium} which allows for asymmetric

pair of regret constraints, where we show that any such equilibrium is
reachable by a pair of algorithms which maintain their regret guarantees
against arbitrary opponents. As a central example, we highlight the case one
agent is no-swap and the other's regret is unconstrained. We show that this
captures an extension of {\it Stackelberg} equilibria with a matching optimal
value, and that there exists a wide class of games where a player can
significantly increase their utility by deviating from a no-swap-regret
algorithm against a no-swap learner (in fact, almost any game without pure Nash
equilibria is of this form). Additionally, we make use of generalized
equilibria to consider tradeoffs in terms of the opponent's algorithm choice.
We give a tight characterization for the maximal reward obtainable against {\it

bounded away from the value obtainable against the class of common

opponent's learning algorithm: the Stackelberg strategy is learnable in
exponential time with any no-regret agent (and in polynomial time with any
no-{\it adaptive}-regret agent) for any game where it is learnable via queries,

their superior application to various applications. Most DSR models use merely
the target sequences as supervision without considering other related

smoothing each token, reallocating a small value to other tokens for mitigating
overconfidence. However, they do not consider tokens/sequences correlations
that may provide more effective information to regularize training and thus
lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we find tokens/sequences with
high perception and semantic correlations with the target ones contain more
correlated and effective information and thus facilitate more effective

Sequence Regularization framework, which explore perceptively and semantically

semantic context-free recognition and a language model to acquire similar

the overall distributional discrepancies between features in the source domain

labeling function usually has different sensitivities to the changes in the

is less optimal. This paper proposes a new domain adaptation approach in which
one can measure the differences in the internal dependence structure separately
from those in the marginals. By optimizing the relative weights among them, the
new regularization strategy greatly relaxes the rigidness of the existing

as noise-reduction, feature enhancement and object detection. A primary
limitation of these approaches is the computational complexity due to the
interdependence of neighboring pixels which limits the ability to perform full
posterior sampling through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To alleviate this
problem, we develop a new posterior sampling method that is based on modeling
the prior and likelihood in the space of the Fourier transform of the image.
One advantage of Fourier-based methods is that many spatially correlated
processes in image space can be represented via independent processes over
Fourier space. A recent approach known as Bayesian Image Analysis in Fourier
Space (or BIFS), has introduced parameter functions to describe prior
expectations about image properties in Fourier space. To date BIFS has relied
on Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation for generating posterior estimates;
providing just a single point estimate. The work presented here develops a
posterior sampling approach for BIFS that can explore the full posterior
distribution while continuing to take advantage of the independence modeling
over Fourier space. As a result computational efficiency is improved over that
for conventional Bayesian image analysis and mixing concerns that commonly have
to be dealt with in high dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling problems
are avoided. Implementation results and details are provided using simulated

Click-Through Rate (CTR) applications, where the model performance experiences
a significant degradation at the beginning of the second epoch. Recent advances
try to understand the underlying factors behind this phenomenon through
extensive experiments. However, it is still unknown whether a multi-epoch
training paradigm could achieve better results, as the best performance is
usually achieved by one-epoch training. In this paper, we hypothesize that the
emergence of this phenomenon may be attributed to the susceptibility of the
embedding layer to overfitting, which can stem from the high-dimensional
sparsity of data. To maintain feature sparsity while simultaneously avoiding
overfitting of embeddings, we propose a novel Multi-Epoch learning with Data
Augmentation (MEDA), which can be directly applied to most deep CTR models.
MEDA achieves data augmentation by reinitializing the embedding layer in each
epoch, thereby avoiding embedding overfitting and simultaneously improving
convergence. To our best knowledge, MEDA is the first multi-epoch training
paradigm designed for deep CTR prediction models. We conduct extensive
experiments on several public datasets, and the effectiveness of our proposed
MEDA is fully verified. Notably, the results show that MEDA can significantly
outperform the conventional one-epoch training. Besides, MEDA has exhibited
significant benefits in a real-world scene on Kuaishou.

biases due to their nonlinearities. To address this problem, we used global
eddy covariance flux data and Taylor expanded Penman and Penman-Monteith

evapotranspiration mainly stem from the temperature-radiation covariance,
whereas the biases in evapotranspiration due to drying power of air primarily
come from the higher-order terms. Most of these biases can be corrected by
linear regressions of first-order approximations. For Penman-Monteith

significantly reduced when daytime median stomatal conductance is used along

importance of diurnal variation of latent heat fluxes. The nonlinearity

extractor is the backbone of a ResNet based network, which is frozen after
construction by a training strategy using only samples of base audio classes.
However, the classifier consisting of prototypes is expanded by a prototype
adaptation network with few samples of novel audio classes in incremental
sessions. Labeled support samples and unlabeled query samples are used to train
the prototype adaptation network and update the classifier, since they are
informative for audio classification. Three audio datasets, named NSynth-100,

interchangeable modules called \emph{slots} or \emph{object files} that compete
for local patches of an image. The competition has a weak inductive bias to
preserve spatial continuity; consequently, one slot may claim patches scattered
diffusely throughout the image. In contrast, the inductive bias of human vision
is strong, to the degree that attention has classically been described with a
spotlight metaphor. We incorporate a spatial-locality prior into
state-of-the-art object-centric vision models and obtain significant
improvements in segmenting objects in both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Similar to human visual attention, the combination of image content and spatial
constraints yield robust unsupervised object-centric learning, including less

in catalytic efficiency for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The current
linear scaling relationships hinder the optimization of electrocatalytic
performance. To tackle this issue, we investigate the potential of designing
single-atom catalysts (SACs) on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes for electrochemical OER
using first-principles modeling simulations. By employing the Electrochemical
Step Symmetry Index (ESSI) method, we assess OER intermediates to fine-tune
activity and identify the optimal SAC for Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. Our findings
reveal that both Ag and Cu exhibit effectiveness as single atoms for enhancing
OER activity on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. However, among the 21 chosen transition
metals (TMs) in this study, Cu stands out as the best catalyst for tweaking the
overpotential ($\eta_{OER}$). This is due to Cu's lowest overpotential compared
to other TMs, which makes it more favorable for OER performance. On the other
hand, Ag is closely aligned with ESSI=$\eta_{OER}$, making the tuning of its
overpotential more challenging. Furthermore, we employ symbolic regression
analysis to identify the significant factors that exhibit a correlation with
the OER overpotential. By utilizing this approach, we derive mathematical
formulas for the overpotential and identify key descriptors that affect
catalytic efficiency in electrochemical OER on Mo$_2$CO$_2$ MXenes. This
comprehensive investigation not only sheds light on the potential of MXenes in
advanced electrocatalytic processes but also highlights the prospect of
improved activity and selectivity in OER applications.

media sites devoted to opinion and knowledge dissemination has rapidly
increased. Among the short video platforms, TikTok is one of the most popular
globally and has become the platform of choice for transgender and nonbinary
individuals, who have formed a large community to mobilize personal experience
and exchange information. The knowledge produced in online spaces can influence
the ways in which people understand and experience their own gender and
transitions, as they hear about others and weigh that experiential and medical
knowledge against their own. This paper extends current research and past
interview methods on gender euphoria and gender dysphoria to analyze what and
how online communities on TikTok discuss these two types of gender experiences.
Our findings indicate that gender euphoria and gender dysphoria are differently
described in online TikTok spaces. These findings indicate that there are wide
similarities in the words used to describe gender dysphoria as well as gender
euphoria in both the comments of videos and content creators' hashtags.
Finally, our results show that gender euphoria is described in more similar
terms between transfeminine and transmasculine experiences than gender
dysphoria, which appears to be more differentiated by gendering experience and
transition goals. We hope this paper can provide insights for future research
on understanding transgender and nonbinary individuals in online communities.

  Generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.SD eess.AS eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Talking face generation is the task of synthesizing a natural face
synchronous to driving audio. Although much progress has been made in terms of
visual quality, lip synchronization, and facial motion of the talking face,
current works still struggle to overcome issues of crude and asynchronous lip
movement, which can result in puppetry-like animation. We identify that the
prior works commonly correlate lip movement with audio at the phone level.
However, due to co-articulation, where an isolated phone is influenced by the
preceding or following phones, the articulation of a phone varies upon the
phonetic context. Therefore, modeling lip motion with the phonetic context can
generate more spatio-temporally aligned and stable lip movement. In this
respect, we investigate the phonetic context in lip motion for authentic
talking face generation. We propose a Context-Aware Lip-Sync framework (CALS),
which leverages phonetic context to generate more spatio-temporally aligned and
stable lip movement. The CALS comprises an Audio-to-Lip module and a
Lip-to-Face module. The former explicitly maps each phone to a contextualized
lip motion unit, which guides the latter in synthesizing a target identity with
context-aware lip motion. In addition, we introduce a discriminative sync
critic that enforces accurate lip displacements within the phonetic context
through audio-visual sync loss and visual discriminative sync loss. From
extensive experiments on LRW, LRS2, and HDTF datasets, we demonstrate that the
proposed CALS effectively enhances spatio-temporal alignment, greatly improving
upon the state-of-the-art on visual quality, lip-sync quality, and realness.
Finally, we show the authenticity of the generated video through a lip
readability test and achieve 97.7% of relative word prediction accuracy to real

mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier
analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe
for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary
learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being
infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is
necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning
problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain
matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the
irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective
enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality
reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz

a MAR service-oriented task offloading scheme is designed and evaluated in

applications is firstly analyzed and modeled by using directed acyclic graphs.
Then, we propose a look-ahead offloading scheme based on a modified Monte Carlo

applied to generate faulty samples based on the healthy data in the target

adapt to the dynamically evolving class marginals given only labeled online

the extent of drift in the label distribution. Our solution is based on
bootstrapping the estimates of \emph{online regression oracles} that track the

This study investigates the impact of fabrication-induced curvature on the

softening, and mixed nonlinear responses, with varying initial static
displacements. Notably, PMUTs with almost flat initial static displacement
exhibit hardening nonlinearity, while those with a curved initial static
displacement show softening nonlinearity. An exotic mixed nonlinear response is
observed for intermediate static displacement. We attribute the observed
nonlinear response to the interplay between static displacement-induced
quadratic nonlinearity and midplane stretching-induced cubic nonlinearity. We
provide a theoretical formulation for the dynamics of the devices, which
explains the experimental results and highlights the nonlinear responses and
their dependence on the initial static displacement. Our findings underscore

less fluorinated structures. Here, we introduce bis(2-fluoroethoxy)methane
(F2DEM) which features monofluorination of the acetal backbone. High coulombic
efficiency (CE) and stable long-term cycling in Li||Cu half cells can be
achieved with F2DEM even under fast Li metal plating conditions. The
performance of F2DEM is further compared with diethoxymethane (DEM) and
2-[2-(2,2-Difluoroethoxy)ethoxy]-1,1,1-Trifluoroethane (F5DEE). The structural
similarity of DEM allows us to better probe the effects of monofluorination,

reference. The monofluorine substitution provides improved oxidation stability
compared to non-fluorinated DEM, as demonstrated in the linear sweep
voltammetry (LSV) and voltage holding experiments in Li||Pt and Li||Al cells.
Higher ionic conductivity compared to F5DEE is also observed due to the
decreased degree of fluorination. Furthermore, 1.75 M lithium
bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) / F2DEM displays significantly lower
overpotential compared with the two reference electrolytes, which improves
energy efficiency and enables its application in high-rate conditions.

these segments is highly beneficial for many tasks, we hypothesize that this

jointly. This partial two-tower architecture bridges the gap between a Dual
Encoder's ability to pre-compute representations for segments and a fully
self-attentive Transformer's capacity to model cross-segment attention. The
LAIT framework effectively leverages existing pretrained Transformers and
converts them into the hybrid of the two aforementioned architectures, allowing

concerns when deploying these systems in security sensitive applications. In
this study, we present a comparative analysis of the vulnerability of ML and
QML models, specifically conventional neural networks (NN) and quantum neural
networks (QNN), to adversarial attacks using a malware dataset. We utilize a
software supply chain attack dataset known as ClaMP and develop two distinct
models for QNN and NN, employing Pennylane for quantum implementations and
TensorFlow and Keras for traditional implementations. Our methodology involves
crafting adversarial samples by introducing random noise to a small portion of
the dataset and evaluating the impact on the models performance using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score metrics. Based on our observations, both ML and
QML models exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks. While the QNNs
accuracy decreases more significantly compared to the NN after the attack, it
demonstrates better performance in terms of precision and recall, indicating
higher resilience in detecting true positives under adversarial conditions. We
also find that adversarial samples crafted for one model type can impair the
performance of the other, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms.
Our study serves as a foundation for future research focused on enhancing the
security and resilience of ML and QML models, particularly QNN, given its
recent advancements. A more extensive range of experiments will be conducted to
better understand the performance and robustness of both models in the face of
adversarial attacks.

representation spaces of images and text, leading to numerous applications such
as cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, captioning, and more.
However, the aligned image-text spaces learned by all the popular VL models are
still suffering from the so-called `object bias' - their representations behave
as `bags of nouns', mostly ignoring or downsizing the attributes, relations,
and states of objects described/appearing in texts/images. Although some great
attempts at fixing these `compositional reasoning' issues were proposed in the
recent literature, the problem is still far from being solved. In this paper,
we uncover two factors limiting the VL models' compositional reasoning
performance. These two factors are properties of the paired VL dataset used for
finetuning and pre-training the VL model: (i) the caption quality, or in other
words `image-alignment', of the texts; and (ii) the `density' of the captions
in the sense of mentioning all the details appearing on the image. We propose a
fine-tuning approach for automatically treating these factors leveraging a
standard VL dataset (CC3M). Applied to CLIP, we demonstrate its significant
compositional reasoning performance increase of up to $\sim27\%$ over the base
model, up to $\sim20\%$ over the strongest baseline, and by $6.7\%$ on average.

success in generating high-quality, realistic images from given text prompts.
However, previous methods fail to perform accurate modality alignment between
text concepts and generated images due to the lack of fine-level semantic
guidance that successfully diagnoses the modality discrepancy. In this paper,
we propose FineRewards to improve the alignment between text and images in
text-to-image diffusion models by introducing two new fine-grained semantic
rewards: the caption reward and the Semantic Segment Anything (SAM) reward.
From the global semantic view, the caption reward generates a corresponding
detailed caption that depicts all important contents in the synthetic image via
a BLIP-2 model and then calculates the reward score by measuring the similarity
between the generated caption and the given prompt. From the local semantic
view, the SAM reward segments the generated images into local parts with
category labels, and scores the segmented parts by measuring the likelihood of
each category appearing in the prompted scene via a large language model, i.e.,
Vicuna-7B. Additionally, we adopt an assemble reward-ranked learning strategy
to enable the integration of multiple reward functions to jointly guide the
model training. Adapting results of text-to-image models on the MS-COCO
benchmark show that the proposed semantic reward outperforms other baseline
reward functions with a considerable margin on both visual quality and semantic
similarity with the input prompt. Moreover, by adopting the assemble
reward-ranked learning strategy, we further demonstrate that model performance
is further improved when adapting under the unifying of the proposed semantic
reward with the current image rewards.

to jointly train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models
without sharing any local training data. In practice, there can often be
substantial heterogeneity (e.g., class imbalance) across the local data
distributions observed by each of these clients. Under such non-iid data
distributions across clients, FL suffers from the 'client-drift' problem where
every client converges to its own local optimum. This results in slower
convergence and poor performance of the aggregated model. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel regularization technique based on adaptive
self-distillation (ASD) for training models on the client side. Our
regularization scheme adaptively adjusts to the client's training data based
on: (1) the closeness of the local model's predictions with that of the global
model and (2) the client's label distribution. The proposed regularization can
be easily integrated atop existing, state-of-the-art FL algorithms leading to a
further boost in the performance of these off-the-shelf methods. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our proposed FL approach through extensive experiments on
multiple real-world benchmarks (including datasets with common corruptions and

spherical background geometry for finding ideal circle patterns with prescribed
total geodesic curvatures. We prove that the solution of combinatorial Calabi
flow exists for all time and converges if and only if there exists an ideal
circle pattern with prescribed total geodesic curvatures. We also show that if
it converges, it will converge exponentially fast to the desired metric, which
provides an effective algorithm to find certain ideal circle patterns. To our

decreasing the chances of the target states being observed. This paper applies
the Multiself-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion to
search for multiple adjacent marked vertices on the hypercube. Aspects like the
type of marked vertices are considered in addition to using multiple self-loops
and weight compositions. Two scenarios are analyzed. Firstly, the relative
position of non-adjacent marked vertices together with adjacent marked
vertices. Secondly, only adjacent marked vertices are analyzed. Here, we show
experimentally that, with partial phase inversion, a quantum walk can amplify
the probability amplitudes of the target states, reaching success probabilities
of values close to $1$. We also show that the relative position of non-adjacent

results demonstrate that the partial phase inversion of target states is a
promising alternative to search adjacent solutions with quantum walks, which is
a key capacity for real search applications.

smooth graph signals with respect to the underlying graph, or, equivalently,
have low graph total variation (TV). In this paper, we develop GSP-based
approaches to verify the validity of the smoothness assumption of given signals
(data) and an associated graph. The proposed approaches are based on the
representation of network data as the output of a graph filter with a given
graph topology. In particular, we develop two smoothness detectors for the
graph-filter-output model: 1) the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for known model
parameters; and 2) a semi-parametric detector that estimates the graph filter
and then validates its smoothness. The properties of the proposed GSP-based
detectors are investigated, and some special cases are discussed. The
performance of the GSP-based detectors is evaluated on synthetic data and on
IEEE $14$-bus power system data, under different setups. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its robustness to

accounting for angular velocity limitation, performance requirements, and input

Compatible Performance Control (CPC), which integrates the Prescribed
Performance Control (PPC) scheme with a contradiction detection and alleviation
strategy. Firstly, by introducing the Zeroing Barrier Function (ZBF) concept,
we propose a detection strategy to yield judgment on the compatibility between
the angular velocity constraint and the performance envelope constraint.
Subsequently, we propose a projection operator-governed dynamical system with a
varying upper bound to generate an appropriate bounded performance
envelope-modification signal if a contradiction exists, thereby alleviating the
contradiction and promoting compatibility within the system. Next, a dynamical
filter technique is introduced to construct a bounded reference velocity signal
to address the angular velocity limitation. Furthermore, we employ a
time-varying gain technique to address the challenge posed by time-varying
parameter uncertainties, further developing an adaptive strategy that exhibits
robustness on disturbance rejection. By utilizing the proposed CPC scheme and
time-varying gain adaptive strategy, we construct an adaptive CPC controller,
which guarantees the ultimate boundedness of the system, and all constraints
are satisfied simultaneously during the whole control process. Finally,
numerical simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

HOD parameters to study their evolution over cosmic time. The TNG300 galaxy
population strongly depends on the baryonic physics implemented in the
simulation. In contrast, the galaxy population predicted by a basic SHAM model
without scatter is a direct result of the cosmology of the dark matter
simulation. We find that the HOD evolution is similar for both models and is
consistent with a previous study of the HOD evolution in semi-analytical
models. Specifically, this is the case for the ratio between the characteristic
halo masses for hosting central and satellite galaxies. The only HOD parameter
whose evolution varies across models is $\sigma_{\rm logM}$, which contains
information about the stellar mass-halo mass relation of the galaxies and does
not strongly impact galaxy clustering. We also demonstrate that the dependence
on the specific values of the cosmological parameters is small. We conclude
that the cosmology of the galaxy sample, i.e. the cosmological hierarchical
growth of structure, and not the baryonic physics prescriptions, governs the
evolution of the HOD for stellar mass-selected samples. These results have
important implications for populating simulated lightcones with galaxies and

  Distortion","24 pages, 1 figure, EC'23",,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We revisit the recent breakthrough result of Gkatzelis et al. on
(single-winner) metric voting, which showed that the optimal distortion of 3
can be achieved by a mechanism called Plurality Matching. The rule picks an
arbitrary candidate for whom a certain candidate-specific bipartite graph
contains a perfect matching, and thus, it is not neutral (i.e, symmetric with
respect to candidates). Subsequently, a much simpler rule called Plurality Veto
was shown to achieve distortion 3 as well. This rule only constructs such a
matching implicitly but the winner depends on the order that voters are
processed, and thus, it is not anonymous (i.e., symmetric with respect to
voters).
  We provide an intuitive interpretation of this matching by generalizing the
classical notion of the (proportional) veto core in social choice theory. This
interpretation opens up a number of immediate consequences. Previous methods
for electing a candidate from the veto core can be interpreted simply as
matching algorithms. Different election methods realize different matchings, in
turn leading to different sets of candidates as winners. For a broad
generalization of the veto core, we show that the generalized veto core is
equal to the set of candidates who can emerge as winners under a natural class
of matching algorithms reminiscent of Serial Dictatorship.
  Extending these matching algorithms into continuous time, we obtain a highly
practical voting rule with optimal distortion 3, which is also intuitive and
easy to explain: Each candidate starts off with public support equal to his
plurality score. From time 0 to 1, every voter continuously brings down, at
rate 1, the support of her bottom choice among not-yet-eliminated candidates. A
candidate is eliminated if he is opposed by a voter after his support reaches
0. On top of being anonymous and neutral, this rule satisfies many other axioms
desirable in practice.

the global-in-time existence of small data solutions. However, the nonlinear

challenging due to the complex nonlinear relationship between neuronal

already improved our understanding of this system by allowing computational
neuroscientists to create predictive models and bridge biological and machine
vision. During the Sensorium 2022 competition, we introduced benchmarks for
vision models with static input. However, animals operate and excel in dynamic
environments, making it crucial to study and understand how the brain functions
under these conditions. Moreover, many biological theories, such as predictive
coding, suggest that previous input is crucial for current input processing.
Currently, there is no standardized benchmark to identify state-of-the-art
dynamic models of the mouse visual system. To address this gap, we propose the
Sensorium 2023 Competition with dynamic input. This includes the collection of
a new large-scale dataset from the primary visual cortex of five mice,
containing responses from over 38,000 neurons to over 2 hours of dynamic
stimuli per neuron. Participants in the main benchmark track will compete to
identify the best predictive models of neuronal responses for dynamic input. We
will also host a bonus track in which submission performance will be evaluated

stimuli whose statistics differ from the training set. Both tracks will offer
behavioral data along with video stimuli. As before, we will provide code,

We hope this competition will continue to strengthen the accompanying Sensorium

assessed by using the impedance criterion. On the contrary, stability of power
grids is typically analysed by using network state-space representation and
system eigenvalues. It has been already reported in the literature that the
impedance criterion may lead to erroneous results if the dynamics of the grid
frequency is not taken into consideration. Meanwhile, the eigenvalue analysis
is still considered as a reliable method for finding instabilities. However,
the equivalence between these two methods (impedance criterion with frequency
dynamics included and eigenvalue analysis) has not been thoroughly studied
before. In this paper, the impedance method with frequency dynamics included is
compared with the conventional eigenvalue analysis for a system fully based on
electronic interfaces. Analytical expressions that link both methods are
provided, showing that they are identical under certain conditions. Then, both
methods are applied to a system based on a grid-forming and a grid-following
converter. The results obtained from real-time simulations performed in OPAL-RT
are used to validate the theoretical developments and main contributions of
this work.

As a result, when they reduce bias learned from one modality, they usually
increase bias from the other. In this paper, we first model a confounding
effect that causes language and vision bias simultaneously, then propose a
counterfactual inference to remove the influence of this effect. The model
trained in this strategy can concurrently and efficiently reduce vision and
language bias. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reduce
biases resulting from confounding effects of vision and language in VQA,
leveraging causal explain-away relations. We accompany our method with an

mitotic count (method not specified) in 6 instances and the mitotic index (MI,
proportion of mitotic figures per tumor cells) in 5 instances. A particularly
high risk of bias was identified in the available details of the MC methods and
statistical analysis, which often did not quantify the prognostic
discriminative ability of the MC and only reported p-values. A significant

that the age at truncation is independent of the duration. When truncation is a
result of data collection in a restricted time period, the truncation age is
equivalent to the date of birth. The independence assumption is then at odds
with any demographic progress when life expectancy increases with time, with
evidence e.g. on human demography in western civilisations. We model dependence
with a Gumbel copula. Marginally, it is assumed that the duration of interest
is exponentially distributed, and that births stem from a homogeneous Poisson
process. The log-likelihood of the data, considered as truncated sample, is
derived from standard results for point processes. Testing for positive
dependence must include that the hypothetical independence is associated with
the boundary of the parameter space. By non-standard theory, the maximum
likelihood estimator of the exponential and the Gumbel parameter is distributed
as a mixture of a two- and a one-dimensional normal distribution. For the
proof, the third parameter, the unobserved sample size, is profiled out.
Furthermore, verifying identification is simplified by noting that the score of
the profile model for the truncated sample is equal to the score for a simple
sample from the truncated population. In an application to 55 thousand
double-truncated lifetimes of German businesses that closed down over the
period 2014 to 2016, the test does not find an increase in business life
expectancy for later years of the foundation. The $p$-value is $0.5$ because
the likelihood has its maximum for the Gumbel parameter at the parameter space

of the transfer function estimate given by the RIV method is commonly used as
an initialization point for the RIVC estimator. In this paper, we prove that
these estimators share the same converging points for finite sample size when
the continuous-time model has relative degree zero or one. This relation does

of $P_\text{b} = $ 36.116 $\pm$ 0.029 d, using $\sim$5 yr of CARMENES data, as
well as archival RVs from HARPS and HIRES spanning more than 13 years. The flux
received by the planet equals half the instellation on Earth, which places it
in the middle of the conservative habitable zone (HZ) of its host star. The RV
data show evidence for another planet candidate with $M_\text{[c]}\sin i = $
9.7 $\pm$ 1.9 $\text{M}_\oplus$ and $P_\text{[c]} = $ 113.46 $\pm$ 0.20 d. The
long-term stability of the signal and the fact that the best model for our data

arguments for establishing a planetary origin. However, we cannot rule out
stellar activity due to its proximity to the rotation period of HN Lib, which
we measured using CARMENES activity indicators and photometric data from a
ground-based multi-site campaign as well as archival data. The discovery adds
HN Lib b to the shortlist of super-Earth planets in the habitable zone of M

  Objective. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the current
state of QSE research, aiming to identify the most investigated topics, the
types and number of studies, the main reported results, and the most studied
quantum computing tools/frameworks. Additionally, the study aims to explore the
research community's interest in QSE, how it has evolved, and any prior
contributions to the discipline before its formal introduction through the
Talavera Manifesto.
  Method. We searched for relevant articles in several databases and applied
inclusion and exclusion criteria to select the most relevant studies. After
evaluating the quality of the selected resources, we extracted relevant data
from the primary studies and analyzed them.
  Results. We found that QSE research has primarily focused on software
testing, with little attention given to other topics, such as software
engineering management. The most commonly studied technology for techniques and
tools is Qiskit, although, in most studies, either multiple or none specific
technologies were employed. The researchers most interested in QSE are
interconnected through direct collaborations, and several strong collaboration
clusters have been identified. Most articles in QSE have been published in
non-thematic venues, with a preference for conferences.

high-dimensional, it takes a long time to converge. In this study, we propose
to use a coupling based on the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) and to initialize the
state around a local mode of the target distribution. Because of the propensity
of MH to reject proposals, the coupling tends to converge in only one step with
a high probability, leading to high efficiency. We find that our method allows
DBMs to be trained in an end-to-end fashion without greedy pretraining. We also
propose some practical techniques to further improve the performance of DBMs.

comparable generative performance to other deep generative models, achieving

physical processes. Its consequences in the perturbative Bunch-Davies

optical theorem. In this paper, we re-analyse perturbative unitarity for the
Bunch-Davies wavefunction, focusing on: 1) the role of the
$i\epsilon$-prescription and its compatibility with the requirement of
unitarity; 2) the origin of the different ""cutting rules""; 3) the emergence of
the flat-space optical theorem from the cosmological one. We take the
combinatorial point of view of the cosmological polytopes, which provide a
first-principle description for a large class of scalar graphs contributing to
the wavefunctional. The requirement of the positivity of the geometry together
with the preservation of its orientation determine the
$i\epsilon$-prescription. In kinematic space it translates into giving a small
negative imaginary part to all the energies, making the wavefunction
coefficients well-defined for any value of their real part along the real axis.
Unitarity is instead encoded into a non-convex part of the cosmological
polytope, which we name optical polytope. The cosmological optical theorem
emerges as the equivalence between a specific polytope subdivision of the
optical polytope and its triangulations, each of which provides different
cutting rules. The flat-space optical theorem instead emerges from the
non-convexity of the optical polytope. On the more mathematical side, we
provide two definitions of this non-convex geometry, none of them based on the
idea of the non-convex geometry as a union of convex ones.

application to cognitive radio networks.
  While the literature mostly considers synchronous players, radio networks
(e.g. for IoT) tend to have asynchronous devices. This motivates the harder,
asynchronous multiplayer bandits problem, which was first tackled with an
explore-then-commit (ETC) algorithm (see Dakdouk, 2022), with a regret
upper-bound in $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$. Before even considering
decentralization, understanding the centralized case was still a challenge as
it was unknown whether getting a regret smaller than $\Omega(T^{\frac{2}{3}})$
was possible.
  We answer positively this question, as a natural extension of UCB exhibits a
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ minimax regret.
  More importantly, we introduce Cautious Greedy, a centralized algorithm that
yields constant instance-dependent regret if the optimal policy assigns at
least one player on each arm (a situation that is proved to occur when arm
means are close enough). Otherwise, its regret increases as the sum of
$\log(T)$ over some sub-optimality gaps. We provide lower bounds showing that
Cautious Greedy is optimal in the data-dependent terms.
  Therefore, we set up a strong baseline for asynchronous multiplayer bandits
and suggest that learning the optimal policy in this problem might be easier
than thought, at least with centralization.

we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves
model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

that, in the presence of interactions, eigenmodes and eigenvalues of the

interactions induce localization of eigenmodes of the Liouvillian around the
right edge under open boundary conditions. To characterize the Liouvllian skin

captures the Liouvillian skin effect. Furthermore, the presence of the

density fields and their relative errors in the context of robustness to
external factors like noise or constraints during training, like the maximal
available gravity signal strength due to a certain distance exemplified for 433
Eros and 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. It is found that both models trained on a
polyhedral and mascon ground truth perform similarly, indicating that the
ground truth is not the accuracy bottleneck. The impact of solar radiation
pressure on a typical probe affects training neglectable, with the relative
error being of the same magnitude as without noise. However, limiting the
precision of measurement data by applying Gaussian noise hurts the obtainable
precision. Further, pretraining is shown as practical in order to speed up
network training. Hence, this work demonstrates that training neural networks
for the gravity inversion problem is appropriate as long as the gravity signal

on forward and backward solutions of the (elastic or acoustic) eave equation.
In a previous paper [1], we explored opportunities of using the finite cell
method (FCM) as the wave field solver to incorporate highly complex geometric
models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the identification of the model's
density outperforms that of the velocity -- particularly in cases where unknown
voids characterized by homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions need to be
detected. The paper at hand extends this previous study: The isogeometric
finite cell analysis (IGA-FCM) -- a combination of isogeometric analysis (IGA)
and FCM -- is applied for the wave field solver, with the advantage that the
polynomial degree and subsequently also the sampling frequency of the wave
field can be increased quite easily. Since the inversion efficiency strongly
depends on the accuracy of the forward and backward wave field solution and of
the gradient of the functional, consistent and lumped mass matrix
discretization are compared. The resolution of the grid describing the unknown
material density is the decouple from the knot span grid. Finally, we propose
an adaptive multi-resolution algorithm that refines the material grid only
locally using an image processing-based refinement indicator. The developed
inversion framework allows fast and memory-efficient wave simulation and object
identification. While we study the general behavior of the proposed approach on

we predict the number of detectable bright sirens based on three different MBHB

Taiji-TianQin-LISA network alone could achieve a constraint precision of
$0.9\%$ for the Hubble constant, meeting the standard of precision cosmology.
Moreover, the Taiji-TianQin-LISA network could effectively break the
cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by the CMB data, particularly in
the dynamical dark energy models. When combined with the CMB data, the joint
CMB+Taiji-TianQin-LISA data offer $\sigma(w)=0.036$ in the $w$CDM model, which
is close to the latest constraint result obtained from the CMB+SN data. We also
consider a conservative scenario in which EM counterparts are not available.
Due to the precise sky localizations of MBHBs by the Taiji-TianQin-LISA
network, the constraint precision of the Hubble constant is expected to reach
1.1\%. In conclusion, the GW standard sirens from the Taiji-TianQin-LISA

experimental analysis, in which the full Run 2 data collected at 13 TeV has
been included and an improved experimental calibration has been applied, the
local significance of the excess amounts to $2.9\sigma$. The presence of this
diphoton excess is especially interesting in view of a further excess observed
by CMS in ditau final states at a comparable mass and similar local
significance. Moreover, an excess of events with about $2\sigma$ local
significance and consistent with a mass of 95 GeV was observed in LEP searches
for a Higgs boson decaying to pairs of bottom quarks. We interpret the CMS

message-passing steps that consist in local aggregations of node features.
Having deep models that can leverage longer-range interactions between nodes is
hindered by the issues of over-smoothing and over-squashing. In particular, the
latter is attributed to the graph topology which guides the message-passing,
causing a node representation to become insensitive to information contained at
distant nodes. Many graph rewiring methods have been proposed to remedy or
mitigate this problem. However, properly evaluating the benefits of these
methods is made difficult by the coupling of over-squashing with other issues
strictly related to model training, such as vanishing gradients. Therefore, we
propose an evaluation setting based on message-passing models that do not
require training to compute node and graph representations. We perform a
systematic experimental comparison on real-world node and graph classification
tasks, showing that rewiring the underlying graph rarely does confer a
practical benefit for message-passing.

use of an efficient technique termed dynamic directional modulation (DDM), and
is subsequently assessed in terms of the measure of information leakage.
Recently, a variation of DDM termed low-power dynamic directional modulation
(LPDDM) has attracted significant attention as a prominent secure transmission
method due to its ability to further improve the privacy of wireless
communications. Roughly speaking, this modulation operates by randomly
selecting the transmitting antenna from an antenna array whose radiation
pattern is well known. Thereafter, the modulator adjusts the constellation
phase so as to ensure that only the legitimate receiver recovers the
information. To begin with, we highlight some privacy boundaries inherent to
the underlying system. In addition, we propose features that the antenna array
must meet in order to increase the privacy of a wireless communication system.
Last, we adopt a uniform circular monopole antenna array with equiprobable
transmitting antennas in order to assess the impact of DDM on the information
leakage. It is shown that the bit error rate, while being a useful metric in
the evaluation of wireless communication systems, does not provide the full
information about the vulnerability of the underlying system.

characterizing the slip spectrum and understanding its link with coeval

limited to the largest events, because the deformation transients are often
concealed in the noise of the geodetic data. Here we present the first
multi-station deep learning SSE detector applied blindly to multiple raw

set, and in the combination of convolutional and attention-based neural
networks. Applied to real data in Cascadia over the period 2007-2022, it
detects 78 SSEs, that compare well to existing independent benchmarks: 87.5% of
previously catalogued SSEs are retrieved, each detection falling within a peak
of tremor activity. Our method also provides useful proxies on the SSE duration
and may help illuminate relationships between tremor chatter and the nucleation
of the slow rupture. We find an average day-long time lag between the slow
deformation and the tremor chatter both at a global- and local-temporal scale,
suggesting that slow slip may drive the rupture of nearby small asperities.

assumed to be nonstochastic in classical spatial econometrics, which is perhaps
not realistic in real applications. Motivated by the machine learning

significantly reduces the computational complexity of the QMLE. The asymptotic
properties of parameter estimators under the random weights matrix and
regressors are established, which provides a new theoretical framework for the
asymptotic inference of the SAR-type models. The usefulness of the quasi-score

rigid in practice: because they must match \textit{all} points from both

recent works in OT has addressed these computational and modelling limitations,

non-stationarity. We also investigate whether the presence of a Coronal Mass
Ejection (CME) impacts the period evolution of QPPs. We analyse soft X-ray
lightcurves obtained from GOES' X-Ray Sensor (XRS) and assess the dominant
periods in the impulsive and decay phases of the flares using the Fast Fourier
Transform. We relate the rate of period evolution to flare duration, peak flare
energy, and average QPP period. We find evidence of non-stationarity in 81% of
the flares assessed, with most QPPs exhibiting a period evolution of less than
10s between the impulsive and decay phases, of which 66% exhibited an apparent
period growth and 14% showed an apparent period shrinkage. We find a positive
correlation between the absolute magnitude of period evolution and the duration
of the flare and no correlation between the period evolution of the QPPs and
flare energy or CME presence. Furthermore, we conclude that non-stationarity is
common in solar QPPs and must be accounted for in flare analysis.

dichotomization of patients is often made. As the evaluations of prognostic
capacity, the survivals of groups with high/low expression of the biomarker are
often estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference between groups
is summarized via the hazard ratio (HR). The high/low expressions are usually
determined by study-specific cutoff values, which brings heterogeneity over
multiple prognosis studies and difficulty to synthesizing the results in a
simple way. In meta-analysis of diagnostic studies with binary outcomes, the
summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) analysis provides a useful
cutoff-free summary over studies. Recently, this methodology has been extended
to the time-dependent SROC analysis for time-to-event outcomes in meta-analysis

process specific to prognosis studies, we introduce a trivariate model on the

the proved asymptotic property of the trivariate model, we introduce a

illustrate the proposed sensitivity analysis method through the meta-analysis

these aberrations with a wavefront sensor (e.g Shack-Hartmann) located in the
pupil plane, and compensating them either digitally or by adaptive optics with
a wavefront shaper. However, in its usual implementation this strategy can only
extract aberrations within a single isoplanatic patch, i.e. a region where the
aberrations remain correlated. This limitation severely reduces the effective

of agents, a computational model was employed in which agents participate in
various language games. Among these, the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG)
possesses a notable mathematical property: symbol emergence through MHNG is
proven to be a decentralized Bayesian inference of representations shared by
the agents. However, the previously proposed MHNG is limited to a two-agent
scenario. This paper extends MHNG to an N-agent scenario. The main
contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) we propose the recursive
Metropolis-Hastings naming game (RMHNG) as an N-agent version of MHNG and
demonstrate that RMHNG is an approximate Bayesian inference method for the
posterior distribution over a latent variable shared by agents, similar to
MHNG; and (2) we empirically evaluate the performance of RMHNG on synthetic and
real image data, enabling multiple agents to develop and share a symbol system.
Furthermore, we introduce two types of approximations -- one-sample and
limited-length -- to reduce computational complexity while maintaining the
ability to explain communication in a population of agents. The experimental
findings showcased the efficacy of RMHNG as a decentralized Bayesian inference
for approximating the posterior distribution concerning latent variables, which
are jointly shared among agents, akin to MHNG. Moreover, the utilization of
RMHNG elucidated the agents' capacity to exchange symbols. Furthermore, the
study discovered that even the computationally simplified version of RMHNG
could enable symbols to emerge among the agents.

variation. This happens when a compression, acting along the axial boundaries,
exceeds a certain critical value. Linear elasticity models are not complex
enough to capture the so-called beam's buckling, and nonlinear constitutive
relations, as the hyperelastic laws, are required to investigate this behavior,
whose mathematical counterpart is represented by bifurcating phenomena. The
numerical analysis of the bifurcating modes and the post-buckling behavior, is
usually unaffordable by means of standard high-fidelity techniques such (as the
Finite Element method) and the efficiency of Reduced Order Models (ROMs), e.g.\

filtration (BPF) algorithms for mSTCT, including D-BPF and S-BPF, make some
intolerable errors in the image edges due to an unstable backprojection
weighting factor and the half-scan mode, which deviates from the intention of
mSTCT imaging. In this paper, to achieve reconstruction with as little error as
possible under the extremely extended FOV, we propose two strategies, including
deriving a no-weighting D-BPF (NWD-BPF) for mSTCT and introducing BPFs into a
special full-scan mSTCT (F-mSTCT) to balance errors, i.e., abbreviated as
FD-BPF and FS-BPF. For the first strategy, we eliminate this unstable
backprojection weighting factor by introducing a special variable relationship
in D-BPF. For the second strategy, we combine the F-mSTCT geometry with BPFs to
study the performance and derive a suitable redundant weighting function for
F-mSTCT. The experiments demonstrate our proposed methods for these strategies.
Among them, NWD-BPF can weaken the instability at the image edges but blur the
details, and FS-BPF can get high-quality stable images under the extremely
extended FOV imaging a large object but requires more projections than FD-BPF.
For different practical requirements in extending FOV imaging, we give
suggestions on algorithm selection.

an ill-posed inverse problem and its solution is difficult to approximate when
noise affects the data. Really, one limitation of neural networks for
deblurring is their sensitivity to noise and other perturbations, which can
lead to instability and produce poor reconstructions. In addition, networks do
not necessarily take into account the numerical formulation of the underlying
imaging problem, when trained end-to-end. In this paper, we propose some
strategies to improve stability without losing to much accuracy to deblur
images with deep-learning based methods. First, we suggest a very small neural
architecture, which reduces the execution time for training, satisfying a green
AI need, and does not extremely amplify noise in the computed image. Second, we
introduce a unified framework where a pre-processing step balances the lack of
stability of the following, neural network-based, step. Two different
pre-processors are presented: the former implements a strong parameter-free
denoiser, and the latter is a variational model-based regularized formulation
of the latent imaging problem. This framework is also formally characterized by
mathematical analysis. Numerical experiments are performed to verify the
accuracy and stability of the proposed approaches for image deblurring when

improve the network stability with respect to noise. In particular, the

public health and disease surveillance with hierarchical Bayesian models being
the current state-of-the-art approach. When working with areal data, e.g.
aggregates at the administrative unit level such as district or province,
routinely used models rely on the adjacency structure of areal units to account
for spatial correlations. The goal of disease surveillance systems is to track
disease outcomes over time, but this provides challenging in situations of
crises, such as political changes, leading to changes of administrative
boundaries. Kenya is an example of such country. Moreover, adjacency-based
approach ignores the continuous nature of spatial processes and cannot solve
the change-of-support problem, i.e. when administrative boundaries change. We
present a novel, practical, and easy to implement solution relying on a
methodology combining deep generative modelling and fully Bayesian inference.
We build on the recent work of PriorVAE able to encode spatial priors over
small areas with variational autoencoders, to map malaria prevalence in Kenya.
We solve the change-of-support problem arising from Kenya changing its district
boundaries in 2010. We draw realisations of the Gaussian Process (GP) prior
over a fine artificial spatial grid representing continuous space and then
aggregate these realisations to the level of administrative boundaries. The
aggregated values are then encoded using the PriorVAE technique. The trained
priors (aggVAE) are then used at the inference stage instead of the GP priors

simulation (DNS) study of the effect of flow shear on dynamo instability for a

Our observations suggest that for helical base flow, the effect of shear is to
suppress the small scale dynamo (SSD) action, i.e, shear helps the large scale
magnetic field to manifest itself by suppressing SSD action. For non-helical
base flows, flow shear has the opposite effect of amplifying the small-scale
dynamo action. The magnetic energy growth rate ($\gamma$) for non-helical base
flows are found to follow an algebraic nature of the form, $\gamma = - aS +

strength and $\gamma$ is found to be independent of scale of flow shear.
Studies with different shear profiles and shear scale lengths for non-helical

attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention,
is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit

prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention
yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be
implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank
property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show
state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes
Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical
self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the

protected by inversion-symmetry that exhibit hinge-localized chiral channels

suggested that axion insulators may be capable of detecting dark-matter
axion-like particles by coupling to their axionic excitations. Beyond its
fundamental theoretical interest, designing a photonic AXI offers the potential
to enable the development of magnetically-tunable photonic switch devices
through the manipulation of the axionic modes and their chiral propagation
using external magnetic fields. Motivated by these facts, in this work, we
propose a novel approach to induce axionic band topology in gyrotropic 3D Weyl
photonic crystals gapped by supercell modulation. To quantize an axionic angle,
we create domain-walls across inversion-symmetric photonic crystals,
incorporating a phase-obstruction in the supercell modulation of their
dielectric elements. This allows us to bind chiral channels on
inversion-related hinges, ultimately leading to the realization of an axionic
chiral channel of light. Moreover, by controlling the material gyrotropic
response, we demonstrate a physically accessible way of manipulating the
axionic modes through a small external magnetic bias, which provides an
effective topological switch between different 1D chiral photonic fiber
configurations. Remarkably, the unidirectional axionic hinge states supported
by the photonic axion insulator are buried in a fully connected 3D dielectric
structure, thereby being protected from radiation through the electromagnetic
continuum. As a result, they are highly suitable for applications in
guided-light communication, where the preservation and non-reciprocal
propagation of photonic signals are of paramount importance.

behavior of a cell in-vitro. They are composed of an active polymer matrix and
a liquid solvent. Their contraction kinetics is governed by two dynamic
phenomena: mechanotransduction (molecular motor activation), and solvent
diffusion. In this paper, we solve the transient problem for the simple case of
a thin gel slab in uniaxial contraction under two extreme conditions:
motor-limited or slow motor activation (SM) regime, and diffusion-limited or
fast motor activation (FM) regime. The former occurs when diffusion is much
faster than mechanotransduction, while the latter occurs in the opposite case.
We observe that in the SM regime, the contraction time scales as t/t_0 ~
(l/l_0)^(-3), with t_0 the nominal contraction time, and l and l_0 are the
final and initial stretches of the slab. t_0 is proportional to 1/w, where w is
the average mechanical power generated by the molecular motors per unit
reference (dry polymer) volume. In the FM regime, the contraction time scales
as t/t_1 ~ (1-l/l_0)^2, with t_1 the nominal contraction time, here
proportional to the ratio L^2/D, where L is the reference (dry polymer)
thickness, and D is the diffusivity of the solvent in the gel. The transition
between the SM and FM regimes is defined by a characteristic power density w^*,
where w << w^* gives the SM regime and w >> w^* gives the FM regime.
Intuitively, w^* is proportional to D/L^2, where, at a given power density w, a
thinner gel slab (smaller L) or including smaller solvent molecules (higher D)
is more likely to be in the SM regime given that solvent diffusion will occur
faster than motor activation.

functioning as an observer of specific behaviors. The activation of the overall
model then identifies which subset of the concept observers is identifying
concepts in the data. This activation is interpretable and based on learned

these tasks usually share partial network filters that lead to the entanglement
of different task inference routes. Due to the inconsistent optimization
objectives, the task gradients used for training MONs will interfere with each
other on the shared routes, which will decrease the overall model performance.
To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient de-conflict algorithm named
DR-MGF(Dynamic Routes and Meta-weighted Gradient Fusion) in this work.
Different from existing de-conflict methods, DR-MGF achieves gradient
de-conflict in MONs by learning task-preferred inference routes. The proposed
method is motivated by our experimental findings: the shared filters are not
equally important to different tasks. By designing the learnable task-specific
importance variables, DR-MGF evaluates the importance of filters for different
tasks. Through making the dominances of tasks over filters be proportional to
the task-specific importance of filters, DR-MGF can effectively reduce the
inter-task interference. The task-specific importance variables ultimately
determine task-preferred inference routes at the end of training iterations.
Extensive experimental results on CIFAR, ImageNet, and NYUv2 illustrate that
DR-MGF outperforms the existing de-conflict methods both in prediction accuracy
and convergence speed of MONs. Furthermore, DR-MGF can be extended to general
MONs without modifying the overall network structures.

introduce a probing task to interpret the ability of PLMs to capture discourse
relation knowledge. We validate three state-of-the-art PLMs across encoder-,
decoder-, and encoder-decoder-based models. The analysis shows that (1) the
ability of PLMs on discourse modelling varies from architecture and layer; (2)
discourse elements in a text lead to different learning difficulties for PLMs.
Besides, we investigate the effects of different PLMs on spoken language
translation. Through experiments on IWSLT2017 Chinese-English dataset, we
empirically reveal that NMT models initialized from different layers of PLMs
exhibit the same trends with the probing task. Our findings are instructive to
understand how and when discourse knowledge in PLMs should work for downstream
tasks.

deployed to train DRSC network by enhancing the cycle consistency between input

time, GS images at arbitrary intermediate scanning time can also be supervised
in SelfDRSC, thus enabling the learned DRSC network to generate a high

is introduced in self-supervised loss for mitigating boundary artifacts in
generated GS images. On synthetic dataset, SelfDRSC achieves better or

ANNs with additions, which are more energy-efficient and less computationally

discrete spike function. A popular approach to circumvent this challenge is
ANN-to-SNN conversion. However, due to the quantization error and accumulating
error, it often requires lots of time steps (high inference latency) to achieve
high performance, which negates SNN's advantages. To this end, this paper
proposes Fast-SNN that achieves high performance with low latency. We
demonstrate the equivalent mapping between temporal quantization in SNNs and
spatial quantization in ANNs, based on which the minimization of the

  control","17 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sensory systems across all modalities and species exhibit adaptation to
continuously changing input statistics. Individual neurons have been shown to
modulate their response gains so as to maximize information transmission in
different stimulus contexts. Experimental measurements have revealed
additional, nuanced sensory adaptation effects including changes in response
maxima and minima, tuning curve repulsion from the adapter stimulus, and
stimulus-driven response decorrelation. Existing explanations of these
phenomena rely on changes in inter-neuronal synaptic efficacy, which, while
more flexible, are unlikely to operate as rapidly or reversibly as single
neuron gain modulations. Using published V1 population adaptation data, we show
that propagation of single neuron gain changes in a recurrent network is
sufficient to capture the entire set of observed adaptation effects. We propose
a novel adaptive efficient coding objective with which single neuron gains are
modulated, maximizing the fidelity of the stimulus representation while
minimizing overall activity in the network. From this objective, we
analytically derive a set of gains that optimize the trade-off between
preserving information about the stimulus and conserving metabolic resources.
Our model generalizes well-established concepts of single neuron adaptive gain
control to recurrent populations, and parsimoniously explains experimental
adaptation data.

over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity systems, our findings are
applied, and globalized solution methods, based on a residual induced by the

The assumptions for fast local convergence are worked out and compared.
Finally, these methods are applied for the numerical solution of bilevel
optimization problems. We recall the derivation of a stationarity condition
taking the shape of an over-determined mixed nonlinear complementarity system

critical issues are security and accuracy. These features, therefore, stimulate
research on quantum state characterization. A characterization tool, Quantum
state tomography, reconstructs the density matrix of an unknown quantum state.
Theoretically, reconstructing an unknown state using this method can be
arbitrarily accurate. However, this is less practical owing to the huge burden
of measurements and data processing for large numbers of qubits. Even
comprising an efficient estimator and a precise algorithm, an optimal
tomographic framework can also be overburdened owing to the exponential growth
of the measurements. Moreover, the consequential postprocessing of huge amounts
of data challenges the capacity of computers. Thus, it is crucial to build an
efficient framework that requires fewer measurements but yields an expected
accuracy. To this end, we built a tomography schema by which only a few Pauli
measurements enable an accurate tomographic reconstruction. Subsequently, this
schema was verified as efficient and accurate through numerical simulations on
the tomography of multi-qubit quantum states. Furthermore, this schema was
proven to be robust through numerical simulations on a noisy superconducting
qubit system. Therefore, the tomography schema paves an alternatively effective
way to reconstruct the density matrix of a quantum state owing to its
efficiency and accuracy, which are essential for quantum state tomography.

attractive alternative, yet, such coarse annotations lack precise information

that, since classes represent not just indices but semantic entities, the
conceptual relationships between them can provide valuable information that

semantic relations to transfer objectness prior from the previously learned
classes into the new ones, complementing the supervisory signal from
image-level labels. We validate our approach on a number of continual learning

magnetic field structure, leading to a different shape of the polarities in the
emerged bipolar regions compared to the FI case. The amount of emerging flux
into the solar atmosphere is larger in the PI case, which has the same initial

the noise power spectral density (PSD) is a critical tool for understanding

such processes can be described by stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI)
systems driven by Gaussian white noise, whose PSD can be concisely expressed in
terms of their Jacobian, dispersion, and diffusion matrices, fully defining the
statistical properties of the system's dynamics at steady-state. Upon expansion
of this expression, one finds that the PSD is a complex rational function of

compact element-wise solutions for the auto- and cross-spectrum that are useful

The mapping of continuous proxies to discrete actions is a promising paradigm

mapping approaches involve searching for discrete neighboring actions in a
static pre-defined neighborhood, which requires discrete neighbor lookups
across the entire action space. Hence, scalability issues persist. To mitigate
this drawback, we propose a novel Dynamic Neighborhood Construction (DNC)

stems from the complexity of integrating diverse syntax and semantics,
language-specific medical terminology, and culture-specific implicit knowledge.
Therefore, one crucial aspect to consider is the presence of community bias
caused by different languages. This paper presents a novel framework named
Unifying Cross-Lingual Medical Vision-Language Pre-Training (Med-UniC),
designed to integrate multimodal medical data from the two most prevalent
languages, English and Spanish. Specifically, we propose Cross-lingual Text
Alignment Regularization (CTR) to explicitly unify cross-lingual semantic
representations of medical reports originating from diverse language
communities. CTR is optimized through latent language disentanglement,
rendering our optimization objective to not depend on negative samples, thereby
significantly mitigating the bias from determining positive-negative sample
pairs within analogous medical reports. Furthermore, it ensures that the
cross-lingual representation is not biased toward any specific language
community. Med-UniC reaches superior performance across 5 medical image tasks
and 10 datasets encompassing over 30 diseases, offering a versatile framework
for unifying multi-modal medical data within diverse linguistic communities.
The experimental outcomes highlight the presence of community bias in
cross-lingual VLP. Reducing this bias enhances the performance not only in

a marine structure. The shape and structural arrangement of the body exposed to
water-wave slamming are considered to be such that the rise time of wave-impact
hydrodynamic loads, $t_{\rm on}$, is short compared to the vibratory response
timescale, $t_{\rm vib}$, of the structure, $t_{\rm on} \ll t_{\rm vib}$.
Without further specifying the details of the body, two asymptotic structural
response regimes are considered: (i) a first regime where the typical wave
impact duration, $t_{\rm imp}$, is much smaller than the vibratory response
timescale, $t_{\rm imp} \ll t_{\rm vib}$; (ii) a second opposite regime where
$t_{\rm imp} \gg t_{\rm vib}$. In the first regime, fatigue is found to be the
dominant failure mechanism, and accounting for the risk of failure due to
fatigue damage yields design constraints which are significantly more
conservative than the constraints obtained from the risk of ultimate strength
exceedance. A detailed modeling of the risk of failure in the second response
regime poses various challenges; in this regime, our results suggest that the
risk of yield stress exceedance may be used as an alternative design criterion.

phase-field method, which has garnered much interest in recent decades.
However, the method lacks a complete model for sintering, as previous works
could show unphysical effects and the inability to reach representative volume
elements. Thus the present paper aims to close this gap by employing molecular
dynamics and determining rules of motion which can be translated to a
phase-field model. The resulting phase-field model is shown to be
representative starting from particle counts between 97 and 262 and contains
the qualitative correct dependence of sintering rate on particle size.

yet their inner mechanisms remain largely unknown. To understand these models,
we need to unravel the functions of individual neurons and their contribution
to the network. This paper introduces a novel automated approach designed to
scale interpretability techniques across a vast array of neurons within LLMs,
to make them more interpretable and ultimately safe. Conventional methods
require examination of examples with strong neuron activation and manual
identification of patterns to decipher the concepts a neuron responds to. We
propose Neuron to Graph (N2G), an innovative tool that automatically extracts a
neuron's behaviour from the dataset it was trained on and translates it into an
interpretable graph. N2G uses truncation and saliency methods to emphasise only
the most pertinent tokens to a neuron while enriching dataset examples with
diverse samples to better encompass the full spectrum of neuron behaviour.
These graphs can be visualised to aid researchers' manual interpretation, and
can generate token activations on text for automatic validation by comparison
with the neuron's ground truth activations, which we use to show that the model
is better at predicting neuron activation than two baseline methods. We also
demonstrate how the generated graph representations can be flexibly used to
facilitate further automation of interpretability research, by searching for
neurons with particular properties, or programmatically comparing neurons to
each other to identify similar neurons. Our method easily scales to build graph
representations for all neurons in a 6-layer Transformer model using a single
Tesla T4 GPU, allowing for wide usability. We release the code and instructions
for use at https://github.com/alexjfoote/Neuron2Graph.

alignment relations between structured data and unstructured data for
structure-aware pretraining. It contrastively trains language models to
represent multi-modal text data and teaches models to distinguish matched
structured data for unstructured texts. 2) Masked Entity Prediction, which
designs an entity-oriented mask strategy and asks language models to fill in
the masked entities. Our experiments show that SANTA achieves state-of-the-art
on code search and product search and conducts convincing results in the
zero-shot setting. SANTA learns tailored representations for multi-modal text

structural semantics by masking and predicting entities in the structured data.

  Operator Learning","21 pages",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there has been significant interest in operator learning, i.e.
learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This has been
particularly relevant in the context of learning partial differential equations
from data. However, it has been observed that proposed models may not behave as
operators when implemented on a computer, questioning the very essence of what
operator learning should be. We contend that in addition to defining the
operator at the continuous level, some form of continuous-discrete equivalence
is necessary for an architecture to genuinely learn the underlying operator,
rather than just discretizations of it. To this end, we propose to employ
frames, a concept in applied harmonic analysis and signal processing that gives
rise to exact and stable discrete representations of continuous signals.
Extending these concepts to operators, we introduce a unifying mathematical
framework of Representation equivalent Neural Operator (ReNO) to ensure
operations at the continuous and discrete level are equivalent. Lack of this
equivalence is quantified in terms of aliasing errors. We analyze various
existing operator learning architectures to determine whether they fall within
this framework, and highlight implications when they fail to do so.

(named MSKdeX) to estimate fine-grained muscle properties from a plain X-ray
image, a low-cost, low-radiation, and highly accessible imaging modality,
through musculoskeletal decomposition leveraging fine-grained segmentation in
CT. We train a multi-channel quantitative image translation model to decompose
an X-ray image into projections of CT of individual muscles to infer the lean
muscle mass and muscle volume. We propose the object-wise intensity-sum loss, a
simple yet surprisingly effective metric invariant to muscle deformation and
projection direction, utilizing information in CT and X-ray images collected
from the same patient. While our method is basically an unpaired image-to-image
translation, we also exploit the nature of the bone's rigidity, which provides
the paired data through 2D-3D rigid registration, adding strong pixel-wise
supervision in unpaired training. Through the evaluation using a 539-patient
dataset, we showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed
conventional methods. The average Pearson correlation coefficient between the

0.863. We believe our method opened up a new musculoskeletal diagnosis method

concentration gradient and consequent diffusiophoresis are primarily normal to
the background flow. This is particularly useful in separation and filtration
processes, as it results in regions of particle accrual and depletion in
continuous flows. Such systems have been examined in several classic papers on
diffusiophoresis, with a focus on the particle dynamics far from boundaries. We
show, through experiments, simulations, and theory, that diffusioosmotic flow
along certain boundaries can result in significant changes in particle dynamics
and particle focusing in near-wall regions. The nonzero velocity at charged
surfaces draws solute and particles along the boundary until the flow
ultimately recirculates. These ""convection rolls,"" which result in the spanwise
migration of polystyrene particles close to boundaries, are apparent near a
glass surface but vanish when the surface is coated with gold. The
three-dimensional nature of the dynamics could have implications for the design

power sum constraint of the BS transmit power and the power reflected by the
IRS, an optimal power allocation (PA) strategy is derived and shown to achieve
0.83 bit rate gain over equal PA. Finally, an IRS with finite phase shifters
being taken into account, generates phase quantization errors, and further
leads to a degradation of receive performance. The corresponding closed-form
performance loss expressions for user's asymptotic SNR, achievable rate (AR),
and bit error rate (BER) are derived for active IRS. Numerical simulation
results show that a 3-bit discrete phase shifter is required to achieve a
trivial performance loss for a large-scale active IRS.

low temperatures, the perturbation is responsible for a phase transition from a
spin glass to a ferromagnetic phase. We show that finite size effects induce
the appearance of a distinctive slow regime in the relaxation dynamics, the
extension of which depends on the size of the system and also on the strength
of the non-disordered perturbation. The long time dynamics is characterized by
the two largest eigenvalues of a spike random matrix which defines the model,
and particularly by the statistics of the gap between them. We characterize the
finite size statistics of the two largest eignevalues of the spike random
matrices in the different regimes, sub-critical, critical and super-critical,
confirming some known results and anticipating others, even in the less studied
critical regime. We also numerically characterize the finite size statistics of
the gap, which we hope may encourage analytical work which is lacking. Finally,
we compute the finite size scaling of the long time relaxation of the energy,
showing the existence of power laws with exponents that depend on the strenght
of the non-disordered perturbation, in a way which is governed by the finite

between individuals through an experimental semiotic study. Previous studies
investigate how humans organize symbol systems through communication using
artificially designed subjective experiments. In this study, we have focused on
a joint attention-naming game (JA-NG) in which participants independently
categorize objects and assign names while assuming their joint attention.
  In the theory of the Metropolis-Hastings naming game (MHNG), listeners accept
provided names according to the acceptance probability computed using the
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm. The theory of MHNG suggests that symbols
emerge as an approximate decentralized Bayesian inference of signs, which is
represented as a shared prior variable if the conditions of MHNG are satisfied.
  This study examines whether human participants exhibit behavior consistent
with MHNG theory when playing JA-NG. By comparing human acceptance decisions of
a partner's naming with acceptance probabilities computed in the MHNG, we
tested whether human behavior is consistent with the MHNG theory. The main
contributions of this study are twofold. First, we reject the null hypothesis
that humans make acceptance judgments with a constant probability, regardless
of the acceptance probability calculated by the MH algorithm. This result
suggests that people followed the acceptance probability computed by the MH
algorithm to some extent. Second, the MH-based model predicted human
acceptance/rejection behavior more accurately than the other four models:
Constant, Numerator, Subtraction, and Binary. This result indicates that symbol
emergence in JA-NG can be explained using MHNG and is considered an approximate
decentralized Bayesian inference.

Micro-ultrasound (micro-US), a novel high-resolution ultrasound technology,

to subtle gray scale changes indicating cancer vs normal tissue. This challenge
can be addressed by training urologists with a large dataset of micro-US images

histopathology images and a 3D micro-US volume. Each pseudo-whole-mount
histopathology image is then registered with the corresponding axial micro-US
slice using a two-stage approach that estimates an affine transformation

subsequently been switched off. This work applies techniques of Bayesian
optimal experimental design to (sequentially) selecting the positions for the
activation coil in order to increase the value of data and enable more accurate
reconstructions in a simplified measurement setup. Both Gaussian and total
variation prior models are considered for the distribution of the
nanoparticles. The former allows simultaneous offline computation of optimized
designs for multiple consecutive activations, while the latter introduces
adaptability into the algorithm by using previously measured data in choosing
the position of the next activation. The total variation prior has a desirable
edge-enhancing characteristic, but with the downside that the computationally
attractive Gaussian form of the posterior density is lost. To overcome this
challenge, the lagged diffusivity iteration is used to provide an approximate
Gaussian posterior model and allow the use of the standard Bayesian A- and
D-optimality criteria for the total variation prior as well. Two-dimensional
numerical experiments are performed on a few sample targets, with the
conclusion that the optimized activation positions lead, in general, to better
reconstructions than symmetric reference setups when the target distribution or

continuum emission from ram pressure stripped tails based on the pure
synchrotron cooling of a radio plasma moving along the stripping direction with
a uniform velocity. We combine LOFAR and uGMRT observations at 144 and 400 MHz
to study the flux density and spectral index profiles of the radio tails of 7
galaxies in Abell 2255, and use the model to reproduce the flux density and
spectral index profiles, and infer the stripped radio plasma velocity. For 5
out of 7 galaxies we observe monotonic decrease in both flux density and
spectral index up to $~30$ kpc from their stellar disk. Our model reproduces
the observed trends with a radio plasma bulk projected velocity between 160 and
430 km s$^{-1}$. This result represents the first indirect measure of the
stripped, nonthermal interstellar medium velocity. The observed spectral index
trends indicate that the synchrotron cooling is faster than the adiabatic
expansion losses, thus suggesting that the stripped radio plasma can survive
for a few tens of Myr outside of the stellar disk. This provides a lower limit
for the lifetime of the stripped ISM outside of the disk. As a proof of
concept, we use the best-fit velocities to constrain the galaxies' 3D velocity
in the cluster to be in the 300-1300 km s$^{-1}$. We estimate the ram pressure
affecting these galaxies to be between 0.1 and 2.9 $\times10^{-11}$ erg
cm$^{-3}$, and measure the inclination between their stellar disk and the ram
pressure wind.

(DG) methods aim to address this issue by training a robust model on the source
domain, which has a strong generalization ability. Previously, many DG methods
based on feature-space domain randomization have been proposed, which, however,
suffer from the limited and unordered search space of feature styles. In this
paper, we propose a multi-source DG method called Treasure in Distribution
(TriD), which constructs an unprecedented search space to obtain the model with
strong robustness by randomly sampling from a uniform distribution. To learn
the domain-invariant representations explicitly, we further devise a
style-mixing strategy in our TriD, which mixes the feature styles by randomly
mixing the augmented and original statistics along the channel wise and can be
extended to other DG methods. Extensive experiments on two medical segmentation
tasks with different modalities demonstrate that our TriD achieves superior
generalization performance on unseen target-domain data. Code is available at

first complete analysis to the angular power spectrum of such scalar-induced

inhomogeneities, the Sachs-Wolfe effect, and their crossing. It is anticipated
to have frequency dependence and multipole dependence, i.e.,
$C_\ell(\nu)\propto [\ell(\ell+1)]^{-1}$ with $\nu$ being a frequency and
$\ell$ referring to the $\ell$-th spherical harmonic multipole. In particular,
the initial inhomogeneites in this background depend on gravitational-wave
frequency. These properties are potentially useful for the component
separation, foreground removal, and breaking degeneracies in model parameters,
making the non-Gaussian parameter $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ measurable. Further,
theoretical expectations may be tested by space-borne gravitational-wave

Accurate prostate segmentation is crucial for prostate volume measurement,

a deep learning approach for automated, fast, and accurate prostate
segmentation on micro-US images. Prostate segmentation on micro-US is
challenging due to artifacts and indistinct borders between the prostate,
bladder, and urethra in the midline. We introduce MicroSegNet, a multi-scale
annotation-guided Transformer UNet model to address this challenge. During the
training process, MicroSegNet focuses more on regions that are hard to segment
(challenging regions), where expert and non-expert annotations show
discrepancies. We achieve this by proposing an annotation-guided cross entropy
loss that assigns larger weight to pixels in hard regions and lower weight to
pixels in easy regions. We trained our model using micro-US images from 55
patients, followed by evaluation on 20 patients. Our MicroSegNet model achieved
a Dice coefficient of 0.942 and a Hausdorff distance of 2.11 mm, outperforming
several state-of-the-art segmentation methods, as well as three human

point queries have encoded requisite text semantics and locations. Furthermore,
we show the surprisingly good extensibility of our method, in terms of

fine-tune Diffusion models with the images generated with GANs, synthesizing
multiple images of the same identity with a variety of accessories, poses,

Mechanisms for lifting spin degeneracy include exchange coupling,
spin-dependent scattering, spin injection-all requiring direct contact between

locally broken time-reversal symmetry through dipolar coupling from nearby
micromagnets to superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. Josephson
supercurrent is hysteretic due to micromangets switching. At or around zero

to bridge the gap between hate speech prediction and the explanations generated

predicting the classification of a text and then providing a posthoc, model

prevent model bias. The bidirectional transformer model BERT has been used for
prediction because of its state of the art efficiency over other Machine

we explore a general mitigation framework using self-verification, which
leverages the LLM to provide provenance for its own extraction and check its

generation, where the latter is often much easier than the former. Experimental
results show that our method consistently improves accuracy for various LLMs in
standard clinical information extraction tasks. Additionally, self-verification
yields interpretations in the form of a short text span corresponding to each

the maximal risk over a set of distributions, Agarwal and Zhang (2022) recently
proposed a variant that replaces risk with excess risk. Compared to DRO, the
new formulation -- minimax excess risk optimization (MERO) has the advantage of
suppressing the effect of heterogeneous noise in different distributions.
However, the choice of excess risk leads to a very challenging minimax
optimization problem, and currently there exists only an inefficient algorithm
for empirical MERO. In this paper, we develop efficient stochastic
approximation approaches which directly target MERO. Specifically, we leverage
techniques from stochastic convex optimization to estimate the minimal risk of
every distribution, and solve MERO as a stochastic convex-concave optimization
(SCCO) problem with biased gradients. The presence of bias makes existing
theoretical guarantees of SCCO inapplicable, and fortunately, we demonstrate
that the bias, caused by the estimation error of the minimal risk, is
under-control. Thus, MERO can still be optimized with a nearly optimal
convergence rate. Moreover, we investigate a practical scenario where the
quantity of samples drawn from each distribution may differ, and propose a
stochastic approach that delivers distribution-dependent convergence rates.

dataset, which was then evaluated over the other two datasets. Results from
this experiment show a significant drop in the model's accuracy (lowest
accuracy: 63.80\%) where fewer smells exist in the training dataset, which has
a noticeable reflection (technical debt) on the model's performance. Finally,
the last and third experiments evaluate our approach by splitting the dataset
into 10 companies. The ML model was trained on the company's site, then all
model-updated weights were transferred to the server. Ultimately, an accuracy
of 98.34% was achieved by the global model that has been trained using 10
companies for 100 training rounds. The results reveal a slight difference in
the global model's accuracy compared to the highest accuracy of the centralized
model, which can be ignored in favour of the global model's comprehensive
knowledge, lower training cost, preservation of data privacy, and avoidance of
the technical debt problem.

of the electromagnetic field leads to complex shifts in the energy levels of
the electron, with the real part of the shift corresponding to a shift in the
energy level and the imaginary part to the width of the energy level. The most
celebrated radiative shift is the Lamb shift between the $2S_{1/2}$ and the
$2P_{1/2}$ levels of the hydrogen atom.~The measurement of this shift in 1947
by Willis Lamb Jr. proved that the prediction by Dirac theory that the energy
levels were degenerate was incorrect. Hans~Bethe's calculation of the shift
demonstrated the renormalization process required to deal with the divergences
plaguing the existing theories and led to the understanding that it was
essential for theory to include interactions with the zero-point quantum vacuum
field. This was the birth of modern quantum electrodynamics (QED). Other
calculations of the Lamb shift followed by Welton and Power in an effort to
clarify the physical mechanisms leading to the shift. We have done a
calculation of the shift using a group theoretical approach which gives the
shift as an integral over frequency of a function, which we call the spectral
density of the shift. The spectral density reveals how different frequencies
contribute to the total energy shift. We find, for example, that half the
radiative shift for the ground state 1S level in H comes from photon energies
below 9700 eV, and that the expressions by Power and Welton do not have the
correct low frequency behavior, although they do give approximately the correct
value for the total shift.

various fields. It was first introduced in the context of viral marketing,
where a company pays a few influencers to promote the product. However, apart
from the cost factor, the capacity of individuals to consume content poses
challenges for implementing IM in real-world scenarios. For example, players on
online gaming platforms can only interact with a limited number of friends. In
addition, we observe that in these scenarios, (i) the initial adopters of
promotion are likely to be the friends of influencers rather than the
influencers themselves, and (ii) existing IM solutions produce sub-par results
with high computational demands. Motivated by these observations, we propose a
new IM variant called capacity constrained influence maximization (CIM), which
aims to select a limited number of influential friends for each initial adopter
such that the promotion can reach more users. To solve CIM effectively, we
design two greedy algorithms, MG-Greedy and RR-Greedy, ensuring the
$1/2$-approximation ratio. To improve the efficiency, we devise the scalable
implementation named RR-OPIM+ with $(1/2-\epsilon)$-approximation and
near-linear running time. We extensively evaluate the performance of 9
approaches on 6 real-world networks, and our solutions outperform all
competitors in terms of result quality and running time. Additionally, we
deploy RR-OPIM+ to online game scenarios, which improves the baseline
considerably.

  applications",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Measurements of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) are pivotal to modern magnetism
and spintronics. Recently, we reported on the Ferris FMR technique, which
relies on large-amplitude modulation of the externally applied magnetic field.
It was shown to benefit from high sensitivity while being broadband. The Ferris
FMR also expanded the resonance linewidth such that the sensitivity to spin
currents was enhanced as well. Eventually, the spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH)
was measurable even in wafer-level measurements that require low current
densities to reduce the Joule heating. Despite the various advantages, analysis
of the Ferris FMR response is limited to numerical modeling where the linewidth
depends on multiple factors such as the field modulation profile and the
magnetization saturation. Here, we describe in detail the basic principles of
operation of the Ferris FMR and discuss its applicability and engineering
considerations. We demonstrated these principles in a measurement of the
orbital Hall effect taking place in Cu, using an Au layer as the orbital to
spin current converter. This illustrates the potential of the Ferris FMR for
the future development of spintronics technology.

paper presents a novel evaluation of the programming proficiency of Generative
Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models, specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, against
coding problems of varying difficulty levels drawn from Codewars. The
experiments reveal a distinct boundary at the 3kyu level, beyond which these
GPT models struggle to provide solutions. These findings led to the proposal of
a measure for coding problem complexity that incorporates both problem
difficulty and the time required for solution. The research emphasizes the need
for validation and creative thinking capabilities in AI models to better
emulate human problem-solving techniques. Future work aims to refine this
proposed complexity measure, enhance AI models with these suggested

landscape of SERPs has undergone a dramatic evolution: SERP features,
encompassing elements such as knowledge panels, media galleries, FAQs, and
more, have emerged as an increasingly prominent facet of these result pages.
Our study examines the crucial role of these features, revealing them to be not
merely aesthetic components, but strongly influence CTR and the associated
behavior of internet users. We demonstrate how these features can significantly
modulate web traffic, either amplifying or attenuating it. We dissect these
intricate interaction effects leveraging a unique dataset of 67,000 keywords
and their respective Google SERPs, spanning over 40 distinct US-based
e-commerce domains, generating over 6 million clicks from 24 million views.
This cross-website dataset, unprecedented in its scope, enables us to assess
the impact of 24 different SERP features on organic CTR. Through an ablation
study modeling CTR, we illustrate the incremental predictive power these
features hold.

  Unsupervised Learning Framework","accepted in IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are emerging as a potential solution to solve
NP-hard wireless resource allocation problems. However, in the presence of
intricate constraints, e.g., users' quality-of-service (QoS) constraints,
guaranteeing constraint satisfaction becomes a fundamental challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework to solve the
classical power control problem in a multi-user interference channel, where the
objective is to maximize the network sumrate under users' minimum data rate or
QoS requirements and power budget constraints. Utilizing a differentiable
projection function, two novel deep learning (DL) solutions are pursued. The
first is called Deep Implicit Projection Network (DIPNet), and the second is
called Deep Explicit Projection Network (DEPNet). DIPNet utilizes a
differentiable convex optimization layer to implicitly define a projection
function. On the other hand, DEPNet uses an explicitly-defined projection
function, which has an iterative nature and relies on a differentiable
correction process. DIPNet requires convex constraints; whereas, the DEPNet
does not require convexity and has a reduced computational complexity. To
enhance the sum-rate performance of the proposed models even further,
Frank-Wolfe algorithm (FW) has been applied to the output of the proposed
models. Extensive simulations depict that the proposed DNN solutions not only
improve the achievable data rate but also achieve zero constraint violation
probability, compared to the existing DNNs. The proposed solutions outperform
the classic optimization methods in terms of computation time complexity.

content for general, wide-ranging purposes. GM content filters are generalized
to filter out content which has a risk of harm in many cases, e.g., hate
speech. However, prohibited content is not always harmful -- there are
instances where generating prohibited content can be beneficial. So, when GMs
filter out content, they preclude beneficial use cases along with harmful ones.
Which use cases are precluded reflects the values embedded in GM content
filtering. Recent work on red teaming proposes methods to bypass GM content
filters to generate harmful content. We coin the term green teaming to describe
methods of bypassing GM content filters to design for beneficial use cases. We
showcase green teaming by: 1) Using ChatGPT as a virtual patient to simulate a
person experiencing suicidal ideation, for suicide support training; 2) Using
Codex to intentionally generate buggy solutions to train students on debugging;
and 3) Examining an Instagram page using Midjourney to generate images of
anti-LGBTQ+ politicians in drag. Finally, we discuss how our use cases
demonstrate green teaming as both a practical design method and a mode of
critique, which problematizes and subverts current understandings of harms and
values in generative AI.

system-to-system (S2S) transferability difficult. This occurs even when
substantial similarities exist in the process dynamics across different

time-series-transformer (TST) framework that exploits the powerful transfer
learning capabilities inherent in transformer algorithms. This was demonstrated
using readily available process data obtained from different crystallizers
operating under various operational scenarios. Using this extensive dataset, we
trained a TST model (CrystalGPT) to exhibit remarkable S2S transferability not
only across all pre-established systems, but also to an unencountered system.
CrystalGPT achieved a cumulative error across all systems, which is eight times
superior to that of existing ML models. Additionally, we coupled CrystalGPT
with a predictive controller to reduce the variance in setpoint tracking to
just 1%.

a driver being on road becomes an essential requirement. The key purpose of
supervision is to detect abnormal behaviours of the driver and promptly send
warnings to him her for avoiding incidents related to traffic accidents. In
this paper, to meet the requirement, based on radar sensors applications, the
authors first use a small sized millimetre wave radar installed at the steering
wheel of the vehicle to collect signals from different head movements of the
driver. The received signals consist of the reflection patterns that change in
response to the head movements of the driver. Then, in order to distinguish
these different movements, a classifier based on the measured signal of the
radar sensor is designed. However, since the collected data set is not large,
in this paper, the authors propose One shot learning to classify four cases of
driver's head movements. The experimental results indicate that the proposed
method can classify the four types of cases according to the various head
movements of the driver with a high accuracy reaching up to 100. In addition,
the classification performance of the proposed method is significantly better
than that of the convolutional neural network model.

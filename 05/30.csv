effective in numerous natural language processing tasks, but designing prompts
that generalize well to diverse problem types can be challenging, especially in
the context of math word problem (MWP) solving. Additionally, it is common to
have a large amount of training data that have a better diversity coverage but
CoT annotations are not available, which limits the use of supervised learning
techniques. To address these issues, we investigate two approaches to leverage
the training data in a few-shot prompting scenario: dynamic program prompting
and program distillation. Our approach is largely inspired by Gao et al.,
(2022), where they proposed to replace the CoT with the programs as the
intermediate reasoning step. Such a prompting strategy allows us to accurately
verify the answer correctness through program execution in MWP solving. Our
dynamic program prompting involves annotating the training data by sampling
correct programs from a large language model, while program distillation
involves adapting a smaller model to the program-annotated training data. Our
experiments on three standard MWP datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
these approaches, yielding significant improvements over previous baselines for
prompting and fine-tuning. Our results suggest that leveraging a large amount
of training data can improve the generalization ability of prompts and boost
the performance of fine-tuned small models in MWP solving

suffers from the inherent ambiguity arising from multiplicity and imperfect

ambiguity, prompting the exploration of probabilistic embeddings to tackle the
challenge. However, the existing probabilistic ITM approach encounters two key
shortcomings; the burden of heavy computations due to the Monte Carlo
approximation, and the loss saturation issue in the face of abundant false
negatives. To overcome the issues, this paper presents an improved
Probabilistic Cross-Modal Embeddings (named PCME++) by introducing a new
probabilistic distance with a closed-form solution. In addition, two
optimization techniques are proposed to enhance PCME++ further; first, the
incorporation of pseudo-positives to prevent the loss saturation problem under
massive false negatives; second, mixed sample data augmentation for
probabilistic matching. Experimental results on MS-COCO Caption and two
extended benchmarks, CxC and ECCV Caption, demonstrate the effectiveness of
PCME++ compared to state-of-the-art ITM methods. The robustness of PCME++ is
also evaluated under noisy image-text correspondences. In addition, the
potential applicability of PCME++ in automatic prompt tuning for zero-shot

the impulse response theory defined in the time domain, we derived a parametric
model in the corresponding frequency domain, with appropriate approximations
for the narrowband case. To validate the model, we implemented a numerical
simulator and tested it with synthetic data. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that the proposed model is computationally feasible, efficient, and compatible

high-redshift galaxies. It is therefore important to have a solid understanding
of how the ionising properties of galaxies are linked to physical and
observable quantities. In this paper, we use the First Light and Reionisation
Epoch Simulations (FLARES) to study the Lyman-continuum (LyC, i.e.
hydrogen-ionising) emission of massive ($M_*>10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$) galaxies
at redshifts $z=5-10$. We find that the specific ionising emissivity (i.e.
intrinsic ionising emissivity per unit stellar mass) decreases as stellar mass
increases, due to the combined effects of increasing age and metallicity.
FLARES predicts a median ionising photon production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic
ionising emissivity per unit intrinsic far-UV luminosity) of
$\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})=25.40^{+0.16}_{-0.17}$, with values
spanning the range $\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})=25-25.75$. This is
within the range of many observational estimates, but below some of the
extremes observed. We compare the production efficiency with observable
properties, and find a weak negative correlation with the UV-continuum slope,
and a positive correlation with the OIII equivalent width. We also consider the
dust-attenuated production efficiency (i.e. intrinsic ionising emissivity per
unit dust-attenuated far-UV luminosity), and find a median of
$\log_{10}(\xi_{\rm ion}\rm{/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.5$. Within our sample of
$M_*>10^8\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ galaxies, it is the stellar populations in low
mass galaxies that contribute the most to the total ionising emissivity. Active
galactic nuclei (AGN) emission accounts for $10-20$ % of the total emissivity
at a given redshift, and extends the LyC luminosity function by $\sim0.5$ dex.

in the optical is the Balmer/4000~\AA\ break; this is, in principle, a
diagnostic of the mean ages of composite stellar populations. However, the
Balmer break is also sensitive to the shape of the star formation history, the
stellar (and gas) metallicity, the presence of nebular continuum emission, and
dust attenuation. In this work we explore the origin of the Balmer/4000~\AA\
break using the SYNTHESIZER synthetic observations package. We then make
predictions of the Balmer/4000~\AA\ break using the First Light and

break strength weakly correlates with stellar mass and rest-frame far-UV
luminosity, but that this is predominantly driven by dust attenuation. We also
find that break strength provides a weak diagnostic of the age but performs
better as a means to constrain star formation and stellar mass, alongside the
UV and optical luminosity, respectively.

revealed on large-scales unexpected features known as anomalies, which
challenge the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological

two-point angular correlation function of CMB temperature anisotropies is
compatible with zero, differently from the predictions of the standard model.
This anomaly could indicate a deviation from the standard model, unknown
systematics, or simply a rare realization of the model itself. In this study,
we explore the possibility that the lack-of-correlation anomaly is a
consequence of living in a rare realization of the standard model, by
leveraging the potential information provided by the cosmological gravitational
wave background (CGWB) detectable by future gravitational wave (GW)
interferometers. We analyze both constrained and unconstrained realizations of
the CGWB to investigate the extent of information that GWs can offer. To
quantify the impact of the CGWB on the lack-of-correlation anomaly, we employ
established estimators and introduce a new estimator that addresses the
``look-elsewhere'' effect. Additionally, we consider three different maximum
multipoles, denoted as $\ell_{\rm max}$, to account for the anticipated
capabilities of future GW detectors ($\ell_{\rm max} = 4, 6, 10$). Summarizing
our findings for the case of $\ell_{\rm max} = 4$, we identify the angular
range $[63^\circ - 180^\circ]$ as the region where future observations of the
CGWB maximize the probability of rejecting the standard model. Furthermore, we
calculate the expected significance of this observation, demonstrating that
98.81% (81.67%) of the GW realizations enhance the current significance of the

significantly distinguish personas of the target group from corresponding
unmarked ones. We find that the portrayals generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4

We propose a numerically robust, computationally efficient approach to solve

topographs, we calculate local structural distortions to find a high

consistent with the monoclinic structure in the antiferromagnetic state.
Interestingly, we observe a substantial domain wall change by small temperature

much higher antiferromagnetic ordering temperature of FeTe. This is in contrast
to electronic nematic domains in the cousin FeSe multilayer films, where we
find no electronic or structural change within the same temperature range. Our

which is assumed to be Dirichlet type. Our functional framework centers around
fractional Sobolev spaces. We treat both high regularity and low regularity
solutions: in the former setting, the relevant nonlinearity can be handled via
the Banach algebra property; in the latter setting, however, delicate
Strichartz estimates must be established. This task is especially challenging
in the framework of nonhomogeneous initial-boundary value problems, as it
involves proving boundary-type Strichartz estimates that are not common in the
study of initial value problems.
  The linear analysis, which is the core of this work, crucially relies on a
weak solution formulation defined through the novel solution formulae obtained
via the Fokas method. In this connection, we note that the higher-order
Schr\""odinger equation comes with an increased level of difficulty due to the
presence of more than one spatial derivative. This feature manifests itself via
several complications throughout the analysis, including (i) analyticity issues
related to complex square roots, which require careful treatment of branch cuts
and deformations of integration contours; (ii) singularities that emerge upon
changes of variables in the Fourier analysis arguments; (iii) complicated
oscillatory kernels in the weak solution formula for the linear
initial-boundary value problem, which require a subtle analysis of the
dispersion in terms of the regularity of the boundary data. The present work
provides a first, complete treatment via the Fokas method of a nonhomogeneous

a unified and simple framework for probing and measuring uncertainty about
concepts represented by models. As a Bayesian extension of linear probing
methods, GPP asks what kind of distribution over classifiers (of concepts) is
induced by the model. This distribution can be used to measure both what the
model represents and how confident the probe is about what the model
represents. GPP can be applied to any pre-trained model with vector
representations of inputs (e.g., activations). It does not require access to
training data, gradients, or the architecture. We validate GPP on datasets
containing both synthetic and real images. Our experiments show it can (1)
probe a model's representations of concepts even with a very small number of
examples, (2) accurately measure both epistemic uncertainty (how confident the
probe is) and aleatory uncertainty (how fuzzy the concepts are to the model),
and (3) detect out of distribution data using those uncertainty measures as
well as classic methods do. By using Gaussian processes to expand what probing
can offer, GPP provides a data-efficient, versatile and uncertainty-aware tool
for understanding and evaluating the capabilities of machine learning models.

especially with respect to a subsequent access control process, because it
enables both individuals involved to exploit the same document. In this study,
face embeddings serve two purposes: pre-selecting images for large-scale
Morphing Attack generation and detecting potential Morphing Attacks. We build
upon previous embedding studies in both use cases using the MagFace model. For
the first objective, we employ an pre-selection algorithm that pairs
individuals based on face embedding similarity. We quantify the attack
potential of differently morphed face images to compare the usability of
pre-selection in automatically generating numerous successful Morphing Attacks.
Regarding the second objective, we compare embeddings from two state-of-the-art
face recognition systems in terms of their ability to detect Morphing Attacks.
Our findings demonstrate that ArcFace and MagFace provide valuable face
embeddings for image pre-selection. Both open-source and COTS face recognition
systems are susceptible to generated attacks, particularly when pre-selection
is based on embeddings rather than random pairing which was only constrained by
soft biometrics. More accurate face recognition systems exhibit greater
vulnerability to attacks, with COTS systems being the most susceptible.
Additionally, MagFace embeddings serve as a robust alternative for detecting
morphed face images compared to the previously used ArcFace embeddings. The
results endorse the advantages of face embeddings in more effective image
pre-selection for face morphing and accurate detection of morphed face images.
This is supported by extensive analysis of various designed attacks. The
MagFace model proves to be a powerful alternative to the commonly used ArcFace
model for both objectives, pre-selection and attack detection.

identity consistency across frames, the alignment between plain text and visual
content, and a reasonable layout of objects in images. Most previous works
endeavor to meet these requirements by fitting a text-to-image (T2I) model on a
set of videos in the same style and with the same characters, e.g., the
FlintstonesSV dataset. However, the learned T2I models typically struggle to
adapt to new characters, scenes, and styles, and often lack the flexibility to
revise the layout of the synthesized images. This paper proposes a system for
generic interactive story visualization, capable of handling multiple novel
characters and supporting the editing of layout and local structure. It is
developed by leveraging the prior knowledge of large language and T2I models,
trained on massive corpora. The system comprises four interconnected
components: story-to-prompt generation (S2P), text-to-layout generation (T2L),
controllable text-to-image generation (C-T2I), and image-to-video animation
(I2V). First, the S2P module converts concise story information into detailed
prompts required for subsequent stages. Next, T2L generates diverse and
reasonable layouts based on the prompts, offering users the ability to adjust
and refine the layout to their preference. The core component, C-T2I, enables
the creation of images guided by layouts, sketches, and actor-specific
identifiers to maintain consistency and detail across visualizations. Finally,
I2V enriches the visualization process by animating the generated images.
Extensive experiments and a user study are conducted to validate the
effectiveness and flexibility of interactive editing of the proposed system.

recently proposed non-contextual Pauli Hamiltonians. In fermionic problems,
this substitution leads to Hamiltonians with eigenstates that are single Slater

of crystalline systems and they have been heavily used in solid-state physics
due to their versatility and low computational cost. It is quite
straightforward to build an accurate tight-binding model of any crystalline
system using the maximally localized Wannier functions of the crystal as a
basis. In 1D and 2D photonic crystals, it is possible to express the wave
equation as two decoupled scalar eigenproblems where finding a basis of
maximally localized Wannier functions is feasible using standard Wannierization
methods. Unfortunately, in 3D photonic crystals, the vectorial nature of the
electromagnetic solutions cannot be avoided. This precludes the construction of
a basis of maximally localized Wannier functions via usual techniques. In this
work, we show how to overcome this problem by using topological quantum
chemistry which will allow us to express the band structure of the photonic
crystal as a difference of elementary band representations. This can be
achieved by the introduction of a set of auxiliary modes, as recently proposed
by Solja\v{c}i\'c et. al., which regularize the $\Gamma$-point obstruction
arising from transversality constraint of the Maxwell equations. The
decomposition into elementary band representations allows us to isolate a set
of pseudo-orbitals that permit us to construct an accurate
transversality-enforced tight-binding model (TETB) that matches the dispersion,
symmetry content, and topology of the 3D photonic crystal under study.
Moreover, we show how to introduce the effects of a gyrotropic bias in the
framework, modeled via non-minimal coupling to a static magnetic field. Our
work provides the first systematic method to analytically model the photonic
bands of the lowest transverse modes over the entire BZ via a TETB model.

observations by aggregated class, it is easily established that approach
ignores much of the information in the original data set. The initial
theoretical work for interval-valued data was that of Le-Rademacher and Billard
(2011), but those results were limited to estimation of the mean and variance
of a single variable only. This article seeks to redress the limitation of
their work by deriving the maximum likelihood estimator for the all important
covariance statistic, a basic requirement for numerous methodologies, such as
regression, principal components, and canonical analyses. Asymptotic properties
of the proposed estimators are established. The Le-Rademacher and Billard
results emerge as special cases of our wider derivations.

the text-driven ability to the generation and editing of multi-text conditioned

innovative, are often confined to extremely short videos (typically less than
24 frames) and are limited to a single text condition. These constraints
significantly limit their applications given that real-world videos usually
consist of multiple segments, each bearing different semantic information. To
address this challenge, we introduce a novel paradigm dubbed as Gen-L-Video,
capable of extending off-the-shelf short video diffusion models for generating
and editing videos comprising hundreds of frames with diverse semantic segments
without introducing additional training, all while preserving content
consistency. We have implemented three mainstream text-driven video generation
and editing methodologies and extended them to accommodate longer videos imbued
with a variety of semantic segments with our proposed paradigm. Our
experimental outcomes reveal that our approach significantly broadens the
generative and editing capabilities of video diffusion models, offering new

Caputo, Ioffe, Wachtel [CIW] in 2019 as a putative scaling limit for the level
lines of low-temperature 3D Ising interfaces. While the LE has infinitely many
lines, the case of the single line, known as the Ferrari-Spohn (FS) diffusion,
is one of the canonical interfaces appearing in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ)
universality class. In contrast with well studied models with determinantal
structure such as the Airy LE constructed by Corwin and Hammond as well as the
FS diffusion, the $\lambda$-tilted LE is non-integrable. [CIW] constructed a
stationary infinite volume Gibbs measure (the zero boundary LE) as a limit of
finite LEs on finite intervals with zero boundary conditions, and obtained
control on its fluctuations in terms of first moment estimates. Subsequently,
Dembo, Lubetzky, Zeitouni revisited the case of finitely many lines and
established an equivalence between the free and the zero boundary LEs.
  In this article we develop probabilistic arguments to resolve several
questions that remained open. We prove that the infinite volume zero boundary
LE is mixing and hence ergodic and establish a quantitative decay of
correlation. Further, we prove an optimal upper tail estimate for the top line
matching that of the FS diffusion. Finally, we prove uniqueness of the Gibbs
measure in the sense that any uniformly tight LE (a notion which includes all
stationary $\lambda$-tilted LE) must be the zero boundary LE. This immediately
implies that the LE with free boundary conditions, as the number of lines and
the domain size go to infinity arbitrarily converges to this unique LE.

the fact that familiar gauge theories in spacetime dimensions greater than two

take values in topological field theories (TFTs) rather than in mere numbers.
In this paper we begin an exploration of the associativity structure of
non-invertible symmetries in higher dimensions. The first layer of

interferometers, in order to reduce the quantum noise. A fraction of the
interferometer output light can reach the OPO due to sub-optimal isolation of
the squeezing injection path. This backscattered light interacts with squeezed
light generation process, introducing additional measurement noise. We present
a theoretical description of the noise coupling mechanism. We propose a control
scheme to achieve a de-amplification of the backscattered light inside the OPO
with a consequent reduction of the noise caused by it. The scheme was
implemented at the GEO 600 detector and has proven to be crucial in maintaining
a good level of quantum noise reduction of the interferometer for high
parametric gain of the OPO. In particular, the mitigation of the backscattered
light noise helped in reaching 6dB of quantum noise reduction [Phys. Rev. Lett.
126, 041102 (2021)]. The impact of backscattered-light-induced noise on the
squeezing performance is phenomenologically equivalent to increased phase noise
of the squeezing angle control. The results discussed in this paper provide a
way for a more accurate estimation of the residual phase noise of the squeezed
light field.

Observations of $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ in the interstellar medium are
becoming more frequent thanks to the increased telescope capabilities. However,
interpreting these data is still puzzling. In particular, measurements of $\rm
^{14}N/^{15}N$ in diazenylium revealed high levels of anti-fractionation in
cold cores.
  Aims. Furuya & Aikawa (2018), using astrophysical simulations coupled with a
gas-grain chemical code, concluded that the $^{15}$N-depletion in prestellar
cores could be inherited from the initial stages, when $\rm ^{14}N^{15}N$ is
selectively photodissociated and 15N atoms deplete onto the dust grain, forming
ammonia ices. We aim to test this hypothesis.
  Methods. We targeted three sources (the prestellar core L1544, the
protostellar envelope IRAS4A, and the shocked region L1157-B1) with distinct
degrees of desorption or sputtering of the ammonia ices. We observed the NH3
isotopologues with the GBT, and we inferred the $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$ via a
spectral fitting of the observed inversion transitions.
  Results. $^{15}$NH3(1,1) is detected in L1544 and IRAS4A, whilst only upper
limits are deduced in L1157-B1. The NH3 isotopic ratio is significantly lower
towards the protostar than at the centre of L1544, where it is consistent with
the elemental value. We also present the first spatially resolved map of NH3
nitrogen isotopic ratio towards L1544.
  Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that ammonia
ices are enriched in $^{15}$N, leading to a decrease of the $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$
ratio when the ices are sublimated into the gas phase for instance due to the
temperature rise in protostellar envelopes. The ammonia $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N$
value at the centre of L1544 is a factor of 2 lower than that of N2H+,
suggesting that the dominant formation pathway is hydrogenation of N atoms on
dust grains, followed by non-thermal desorption.

of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM
to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF). However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first
fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then
fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize
this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model. In this
paper, we leverage a mapping between reward functions and optimal policies to
show that this constrained reward maximization problem can be optimized exactly
with a single stage of policy training, essentially solving a classification
problem on the human preference data. The resulting algorithm, which we call
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant and computationally
lightweight, eliminating the need for fitting a reward model, sampling from the
LM during fine-tuning, or performing significant hyperparameter tuning. Our
experiments show that DPO can fine-tune LMs to align with human preferences as
well as or better than existing methods. Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds
RLHF's ability to control sentiment of generations and improves response
quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially

Mix-of-Show adopts an embedding-decomposed LoRA (ED-LoRA) for single-client

essence of single concepts and support theoretically limitless concept fusion.
Additionally, we introduce regionally controllable sampling, which extends
spatially controllable sampling (e.g., ControlNet and T2I-Adaptor) to address
attribute binding and missing object problems in multi-concept sampling.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mix-of-Show is capable of composing
multiple customized concepts with high fidelity, including characters, objects,

symmetries of gauge theories with disconnected gauge groups. We will explain
the general principle and provide numerous concrete examples. Following this

confirmed exoplanets, more than half of the total number of exoplanets known
today. These discoveries took place during both Kepler's primary mission, when
it spent 4 years staring at the same part of the sky, and its extended K2
mission, when a mechanical failure forced it to observe different parts of the
sky along the ecliptic. At the very end of the mission, when Kepler was
exhausting the last of its fuel reserves, it collected a short set of
observations known as K2 Campaign 19. So far, no planets have been discovered
in this dataset because it only yielded about a week of high-quality data.
Here, we report some of the last planet discoveries made by Kepler in the
Campaign 19 dataset. We conducted a visual search of the week of high-quality
Campaign 19 data and identified three possible planet transits. Each planet
candidate was originally identified with only one recorded transit, from which
we were able to estimate the planets' radii and estimate the semimajor axes and
orbital periods. Analysis of lower-quality data collected after low fuel
pressure caused the telescope's pointing precision to suffer revealed
additional transits for two of these candidates, allowing us to statistically
validate them as genuine exoplanets. We also tentatively confirm the transits
of one planet with TESS. These discoveries demonstrate Kepler's exoplanet
detection power, even when it was literally running on fumes.

cores are $\gtrsim2$ times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they
may not form via in-situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of
$0.4-0.7$ Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due

coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the 6
galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by $0.2-0.7$ dex. Within each
galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central
stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already
similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the
stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the
extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model
predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies'

neutron stars and eventually will contribute to the discovery of their equation

yield of X-ray astronomy when combined with multimessenger gravitational-wave
astrophysics and black hole shadows. Unfortunately, an exact solution of the
field equations does not exist for neutron stars. Nevertheless, there exist a
variety of approximate compact objects that may characterize massive or neutron
stars. The most studied approximation is the Hartle-Thorne metric that
represents slowly-rotating compact objects, like massive stars, white dwarfs
and neutron stars. Recent investigations of photon orbits and shadows of such
metric revealed that it exhibits chaos close to resonances. Here, we thoroughly
investigate particle orbits around the Hartle-Thorne spacetime. We perform an
exhaustive analysis of bound motion, by varying all parameters involved in the
system. We demonstrate that chaotic regions, known as Birkhoff islands, form
around resonances, where the ratio of the radial and polar frequency of
geodesics, known as the rotation number, is shared throughout the island. This
leads to the formation of plateaus in rotation curves during the most prominent
$2/3$ resonance, which designate nonintegrability. We measure their width and
show how each parameter affects it. The nonintegrability of Hartle-Thorne
metric may affect quasiperiodic oscillations of low-mass X-ray binaries, when
chaos is taken into account, and improve estimates of mass, angular momentum
and multipole moments of astrophysical compact objects.

turbulence and diffraction in the telescope optics, resulting in blurred
images. This makes it difficult to accurately measure the brightness of blended
objects because the contributions from adjacent objects are mixed in a
time-variable manner due to changes in the atmospheric conditions. However,
this effect can be corrected by characterizing the Point Spread Function (PSF),
which describes how a point source is blurred on a detector. This function can
be estimated from the stars in the field of view, which provides a natural
sampling of the PSF across the entire field of view.
  Once the PSF is estimated, it can be removed from the data through the
so-called deconvolution process, leading to images of improved spatial
resolution. The deconvolution operation is an ill-posed inverse problem due to
noise and pixelization of the data. To solve this problem, regularization is
necessary to guarantee the robustness of the solution. Regularization can take
the form of a sparse prior, meaning that the recovered solution can be
represented with only a few basis eigenvectors.
  STARRED is a Python package developed in the context of the COSMOGRAIL
collaboration and applies to a vast variety of astronomical problems. It
proposes to use an isotropic wavelet basis, called Starlets, to regularize the
solution of the deconvolution problem. This family of wavelets has been shown
to be well-suited to represent astronomical objects. STARRED provides two
modules to first reconstruct the PSF, and then perform the deconvolution. It is
based on two key concepts: i) the image is reconstructed in two separate
channels, one for the point sources and one for the extended sources, and ii)
the code relies on the deliberate choice of not completely removing the effect
of the PSF, but rather bringing the image to a higher resolution.

  Southeastern Sectional Meeting, April 2023, Atlanta GA",,,,"math.QA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a series of algorithms for skein manipulation in a genus-2
handlebody, implementing a novel strand sorting method to reduce any skein to a
skein in a 2-punctured disk. This reduction guarantees resolution as a linear
combination of basis elements of the Kauffman Bracket Skein Module. Manually,
these skein manipulations prove to be computationally intensive due to the
inherent exponential nature of skein relations (i.e., a skein diagram with $n$
crossings yields $2^n$ new skein diagrams, each in $\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]$, the
Laurent polynomials with complex coefficients). Thus, as the number of
crossings in a skein diagram increases, manual computations become intractable
and automation desirable. We enable the automation of all skein computations in
the genus-2 handlebody by first converting the skein diagram into an equivalent
array, reducing the task of performing skein computations to that of
implementing array operators, and then proving that we can always recover the
resulting complex Laurent polynomial.

may also accrete significant amounts of matter. To study the dynamics of such a
system requires simultaneously describing the evolving spacetime and the
dynamics of magnetized plasma. Here we present the first relativistic
calculation simulating two equal-mass, non-spinning black holes as they
inspiral from an initial separation of $20M$ ($G=c=1$) almost to merger,
$\simeq 9M$, while accreting gas from a surrounding disk, where $M$ is the
total binary mass. We find that the accretion rate $\dot M$ onto the black
holes first decreases during this period and then reaches a plateau, dropping
by only a factor of $\sim 3$ despite its rapid inspiral. An estimated
bolometric light curve follows the same profile. The minidisks through which
the accretion reaches the black holes are very non-standard. Reynolds, not
Maxwell, stresses dominate, and they oscillate between two distinct structural
states. In one part of the cycle, ``sloshing"" streams transfer mass from one
minidisk to the other through the L1 point at a rate $\sim 0.1\times$ the
accretion rate, carrying kinetic energy at a rate that can be as large as the
peak minidisk bolometric luminosity. We also discover that the minidisks have
time-varying tilts with respect to the orbital plane similar in magnitude to
the circumbinary disk's aspect ratio. The unsigned poloidal flux on the black
hole event horizon is roughly constant at a dimensionless level $\phi\sim 2-3$,
but doubles just before merger; if the black holes had significant spin, this
flux could support jets whose power could approach the radiated luminosity.
This simulation is the first to employ our multipatch infrastructure \pwmhd,
decreasing computational expense per physical time to $\sim 3\%$ of similar
runs using conventional single-grid methods.

appealing owing to its simplicity, this approach is flawed because it neglects
the full posterior information, depends on a heuristically constructed
confidence region, and fails for high signal-to-noise detections. We point out
that the statistically consistent solution is to compute the posterior odds
between two simulated populations, which crucially is a relative measure, and
show how to include the effect of observational biases by conditioning on
source detectability. Applying the approach to several gravitational-wave

cloud. To a first approximation, the phase of the gravitational-wave signal
receives extra correction terms at $-4$PN and $-5.5$PN orders, relative to the
prediction of vacuum general relativity, due to accretion and dynamical
friction, respectively. Future observations by LISA and B-DECIGO have the
potential to detect these effects for a large range of scalar
masses~$m_\mathrm{DM}$ and self-interaction couplings~$\lambda_4$; observations
by ET and Advanced~LIGO could also detect these effects, albeit in a more
limited region of parameter space. Crucially, we find that even if a dark
matter cloud has a bulk density~$\rho_0$ that is too dilute to be detected via
the effects of dynamical friction, the imprints of accretion could still be
observable because it is controlled by the independent scale $\rho_a = 4 m_{\rm

a statistical exploration of Pauli strings via Markov chains. We demonstrate
that sampling such Pauli-Markov chains gives ample flexibility in terms of
partitions where to sample from: in particular, it enables to efficiently
extract the magic contained in the correlations between widely-separated
subsystems, which characterizes the nonlocality of magic. Our method can be
implemented in a variety of situations. We describe an efficient sampling
procedure using Tree Tensor Networks, that exploits their hierarchical
structure leading to a modest $O(\log N)$ computational scaling with system
size. To showcase the applicability and efficiency of our method, we
demonstrate the importance of magic in many-body systems via the following
discoveries: (a) for one dimensional systems, we show that long-range magic
displays strong signatures of conformal quantum criticality (Ising, Potts, and
Gaussian), overcoming the limitations of full state magic; (b) in
two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories, we provide conclusive
evidence that magic is able to identify the confinement-deconfinement
transition, and displays critical scaling behavior even at relatively modest
volumes. Finally, we discuss an experimental implementation of the method,

K) super-Earth like planet. A planet model of an interior of molten magma
containing a significant fraction of dissolved water provides a plausible
explanation for its composition, and its atmosphere could be suitable for
transmission spectroscopy with JWST. The position of TOI-1416 b within the
radius-period distribution corroborates that USPs with periods of less than one
day do not form any special group of planets. Rather, this implies that USPs
belong to a continuous distribution of super-Earth like planets with periods
ranging from the shortest known ones up to ~ 30 days, whose period-radius
distribution is delimitated against larger radii by the Neptune desert and by
the period-radius valley that separates super-Earths from sub-Neptune planets.
In the abundance of small-short periodic planets against period, a plateau
between periods of 0.6 to 1.4 days has however become notable that is
compatible with the low-eccentricity formation channel. For the Neptune desert,
its lower limits required a revision due to the increasing population of short

that may recover a variety of existing dark energy models. Considering three
distinct PADE parametrizations, labeled as PADE-I, SPADE-I and PADE-II, we
first constrain the cosmological scenarios driven by them using the joint
analyses of a series of recently available cosmological probes, namely,
Pantheon sample of Supernovae Type Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations, big bang

microwave background distance priors from Planck 2018 and then we include the

formulate the task of rotated 3D object instance detection. To do so, we
consider a database of 3D indoor scenes, where objects occur in different

classification in the context of this task. We systematically contrast
different choices in a variety of experimental settings investigating the
impact on the performance of different rotation distributions, different
degrees of partial observations on the object, and the different levels of
difficulty of negative pairs. Our study, on a synthetic dataset of 3D scenes
where objects instances occur in different orientations, reveals that deep
learning-based rotation invariant methods are effective for relatively easy
settings with easy-to-distinguish pairs. However, their performance decreases
significantly when the difference in rotations on the input pair is large, or
when the degree of observation of input objects is reduced, or the difficulty
level of input pair is increased. Finally, we connect feature encodings
designed for rotation-invariant methods to 3D geometry that enable them to
acquire the property of rotation invariance.

across the board. However, despite their success, they often err miserably; and
this has triggered significant interest in formally verifying them.
Unfortunately, DNN verifiers are intricate tools, and are themselves
susceptible to soundness bugs. Due to the complexity of DNN verifiers, as well
as the sizes of the DNNs being verified, debugging such errors is a daunting
task. Here, we present a novel tool, named DelBugV, that uses automated delta

a correct verifier as a point of reference (or, in some cases, just a single,
malfunctioning verifier), DelBugV can produce much simpler DNN verification
instances that still trigger undesired behavior -- greatly facilitating the
task of debugging the faulty verifier. Our tool is modular and extensible, and
can easily be enhanced with additional network simplification methods and
strategies. For evaluation purposes, we ran DelBugV on 4 DNN verification
engines, which were observed to produce incorrect results at the 2021 neural

entanglement phases and extend the realm of non-unitary quantum dynamics. Here
we explore the connection between measurement-only quantum circuits in one
spatial dimension and the statistical mechanics of loop models in two
dimensions. While Gaussian Majorana circuits admit a microscopic mapping to
loop models, for non-Gaussian, i.e., generic Clifford, circuits a corresponding
mapping may emerge only on a coarse grained scale. We then focus on a
fundamental symmetry of loop models: the orientability of world lines. We
discuss how orientability enters in the measurement framework, acting as a
separatrix for the universal long-wavelength behavior in a circuit. When
orientability is broken, the circuit falls into the universality class of
closely packed loops with crossings (CPLC) and features a Goldstone phase with
a peculiar, universal $\log^2(L)$-scaling of the entanglement entropy. In turn,
when orientability is preserved, the long-wavelength behavior of the circuit
mimics that of (coupled) two-dimensional Potts models. We demonstrate the
strength of the loop model approach by numerically simulating a variety of
measurement-only Clifford circuits. Upon varying the set of measured operators,
a rich circuit dynamics is observed, ranging from CPLC to the $1$-state Potts
model (percolation), the $2$-state Potts model (Ising) and coupled Potts models
(BKT) universality class. Loop models thus provide a handle to access a large
class of measurement-only circuits and yield a blueprint on how to realize
desired entanglement phases by measurement.

1. its six constituent knowledge, skills, and abilities; 2. a stakeholder
analysis; and 3. ethical practice standards or guidelines. These are briefly
summarized. Five LOs are articulated at each of three levels of cognitive
complexity (low/med/high), and a set of assignment features that can be adapted
repeatedly over a term are given supporting these LOs. These features can
support authentic development of the knowledge, skills, and abilities that are
the target of ethical reasoning instruction in math and quantitative courses at
the tertiary level. Three contexts by which these can be integrated are
Assumption (what if the assumption fails?), Approximation (what if the
approximation does not hold?), and Application (is the application appropriate?
what if it is not?). One or more of the three core contents of Ethical
Reasoning can be added to any problem already utilized in a course (or new
ones) by asking learners to apply the core to the context. Engagement with
ethical reasoning can prepare students to assume their responsibilities to

they rely on fixed datasets or stationary environments. Continual learning (CL)
aims to address this limitation and enable DNNs to accumulate knowledge
incrementally, similar to human learning. Inspired by how our brain
consolidates memories, a powerful strategy in CL is replay, which involves
training the DNN on a mixture of new and all seen classes. However, existing
replay methods overlook two crucial aspects of biological replay: 1) the brain
replays processed neural patterns instead of raw input, and 2) it prioritizes
the replay of recently learned information rather than revisiting all past
experiences. To address these differences, we propose SHARP, an efficient
neuro-inspired CL method that leverages sparse dynamic connectivity and
activation replay. Unlike other activation replay methods, which assume layers
not subjected to replay have been pretrained and fixed, SHARP can continually
update all layers. Also, SHARP is unique in that it only needs to replay few
recently seen classes instead of all past classes. Our experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that SHARP outperforms state-of-the-art replay methods in
class incremental learning. Furthermore, we showcase SHARP's flexibility in a
novel CL scenario where the boundaries between learning episodes are blurry.

relatively low prescription isodose lines. The dose predictions for all the

program synthesis problem that takes a cost metric for regular expressions, and
positive and negative examples of strings as input. It outputs a regular
expression that is precise (i.e., accepts all positive and rejects all negative
examples), and minimal w.r.t. to the cost metric. We present a novel algorithm
for REI over arbitrary alphabets that is enumerative and trades off time for
space. Our main algorithmic idea is to implement the search space of regular
expressions succinctly as a contiguous matrix of bitvectors. Collectively, the
bitvectors represent, as characteristic sequences, all sub-languages of the
infix-closure of the union of positive and negative examples. Mathematically,
this is a semiring of (a variant of) formal power series. Infix-closure enables
bottom-up compositional construction of larger from smaller regular expressions
using the operations of our semiring. This minimises data movement and
data-dependent branching, hence maximises data-parallelism. In addition, the
infix-closure remains unchanged during the search, hence search can be staged:
first pre-compute various expensive operations, and then run the compute
intensive search process. We provide two C++ implementations, one for general
purpose CPUs and one for Nvidia GPUs (using CUDA). We benchmark both on Google
Colab Pro: the GPU implementation is on average over 1000x faster than the CPU
implementation on the hardest benchmarks.

constructed according to decision trees learned from structured multimodal

Markov chain and an observable process, which is a noisy version of the hidden
chain. Decoding the original signal (i.e., hidden chain) from the noisy
observations is one of the main goals in nearly all HMM based data analyses.
Existing decoding algorithms such as the Viterbi algorithm have computational
complexity at best linear in the length of the observed sequence, and
sub-quadratic in the size of the state space of the Markov chain. We present
Quick Adaptive Ternary Segmentation (QATS), a divide-and-conquer procedure
which decodes the hidden sequence in polylogarithmic computational complexity
in the length of the sequence, and cubic in the size of the state space, hence
particularly suited for large scale HMMs with relatively few states. The
procedure also suggests an effective way of data storage as specific cumulative
sums. In essence, the estimated sequence of states sequentially maximizes local
likelihood scores among all local paths with at most three segments. The
maximization is performed only approximately using an adaptive search
procedure. The resulting sequence is admissible in the sense that all
transitions occur with positive probability. To complement formal results
justifying our approach, we present Monte-Carlo simulations which demonstrate
the speedups provided by QATS in comparison to Viterbi, along with a precision

typically demand significant human input to prepare the information into more

novel self information update task in LLMs, which only requires the provision

these data, the fundamental band of CH_4 is absent and the fundamental band of
CO is weak. The nondetection of CH_4 reinforces a previously observed trend of
weaker CH_4 with younger ages among L dwarfs, which has been attributed to
enhanced non-equilibrium chemistry among young objects. The weakness of CO may
reflect an additional atmospheric property that varies with age, such as the
temperature gradient or cloud thickness. We are able to reproduce the broad
shape of the spectrum with an ATMO cloudless model that has T=1300 K,
non-equilibrium chemistry, and a temperature gradient reduction caused by
fingering convection. However, the fundamental bands of CH_4 and CO are
somewhat stronger in the model. In addition, the model temperature of 1300 K is
higher than expected from evolutionary models given the luminosity and age of
TWA 27B (T=1200 K). Previous models of young L-type objects suggest that the
inclusion of clouds could potentially resolve these issues; it remains to be
seen whether cloudy models can provide a good fit to the 1-5um data from
NIRSpec. TWA 27B exhibits emission in Paschen transitions and the He I triplet

This contribution addresses the problem of controlling the turbidity of the

phenomenological model describing the turbidity is too complex to be used in a
control strategy, and it is difficult to identify its parameters using plant

paramount importance for modern photonics. In particular, the so-called snake
instability is universally known to severely distort localized wave stripes,
leading to the occurrence of transient, short-lived dynamical states that
eventually decay. The phenomenon is ubiquitous in nonlinear science, from river
meandering to superfluids, and to date it remains apparently uncontrollable.
However, here we show that optical snake instabilities can be harnessed by a
process that leads to the formation of stationary and robust two-dimensional
zigzag states. We find that such new type of nonlinear waves exists in the
hyperbolic regime of cylindrical micro-resonators and it naturally corresponds
to two-dimensional frequency combs featuring spectral heterogeneity and
intrinsic synchronization. We uncover the conditions of the existence of such
spatiotemporal photonic snakes and confirm their remarkable robustness against
perturbations. Our findings represent a new paradigm for frequency comb
generation, thus opening the door to a whole range of applications in

topological information from the inherent graph structure of MTS as relational

imputation in more challenging MTS data such as networked time series (NTS),
where the underlying graph is constantly changing and might have missing edges.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations.
First, we define the problem of imputation over NTS which contains missing

a new model named PoGeVon which leverages variational autoencoder (VAE) to

deep learning. However, communication often proves costly and becomes the
primary bottleneck in these systems. As a result, there is a demand for the
design of efficient communication mechanisms that can empirically boost
throughput while providing theoretical guarantees. In this work, we introduce
Global-QSGD, a novel family of quantization operators, engineered to accelerate
distributed training based on global scaling. We demonstrate that Global-QSGD
is the first theoretically rigorous Allreduce-compatible compression mechanism
that achieves a provable speed-up by striking a balance between compression
error and communication savings. Importantly, Global-QSGD does not rely on
costly error feedback due to its inherent unbiasedness and offers up to
$O(\sqrt{n})$ additional compression ratio compared to the popular QSGD
quantization ($n$ represents the number of workers). To obtain theoretical
guarantees, we generalize the notion of standard unbiased compression operators
to incorporate Global-QSGD. We show that this wider class permits standard
analysis for unbiased compressors and thus ensures convergence for popular
optimization algorithms (e.g., distributed SGD) under typical settings. For the
empirical component of our work, we carry out a performance modeling analysis
to determine if Global-QSGD can enhance training throughput under specific
hardware configurations. We also conduct extensive empirical evaluations on
various tasks, testing our theory on both NVLink and PCIe connections as well

variability of training environments. Since learning optimal policies for
unseen environments is often very costly and requires substantial data
collection, it becomes computationally intractable to train the agent on every
possible environment or task the AV may encounter. This paper introduces a
zero-shot filtering approach to interpolate learned policies of past
experiences to generalize to unseen ones. We use an experience kernel to
correlate environments. These correlations are then exploited to produce
policies for new tasks or environments from learned policies. We demonstrate
our methods on an autonomous vehicle driving through T-intersections with
different characteristics, where its behavior is modeled as a partially
observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We first construct compact
representations of learned policies for POMDPs with unknown transition
functions given a dataset of sequential actions and observations. Then, we
filter parameterized policies of previously visited environments to generate
policies to new, unseen environments. We demonstrate our approaches on both an
actual AV and a high-fidelity simulator. Results indicate that our experience
filter offers a fast, low-effort, and near-optimal solution to create policies
for tasks or environments never seen before. Furthermore, the generated new
policies outperform the policy learned using the entire data collected from
past environments, suggesting that the correlation among different environments
can be exploited and irrelevant ones can be filtered out.

nebula. A fourth planetesimal, Theia, also formed near Earth where it collided

${\approx}4$\% of its crust and mantle that is now is found on Mars and the
Moon. At the antipode of the giant impact, $\approx$60\% of Earth's crust,
atmosphere, and a large amount of mantle were ejected into space forming the
Moon. The lost crust never reformed and became the Earth's ocean basins. The
Theia impact site corresponds to Indian Ocean gravitational anomaly on Earth
and the Hellas basin on Mars. The dynamics of the giant impact are consistent
with the rotational rates and axial tilts of both Earth and Mars. The giant
impact removed sufficient CO$_2$ from Earth's atmosphere to avoid a runaway
greenhouse effect, initiated plate tectonics, and gave life time to form near
geothermal vents at the continental margins. Mercury formed near Venus where on
a close approach it was slingshot into the Sun's convective zone losing 94\% of
its mass, much of which remains there today. Black carbon, from CO$_2$
decomposed by the intense heat, is still found on the surface of Mercury.
Arriving at 616 km/s, Mercury dramatically altered the Sun's rotational energy,
explaining both its anomalously slow rotation rate and axial tilt. These
results are quantitatively supported by mass balances, the current locations of
the terrestrial planets, and the orientations of their major orbital axes.

of such functions is inherently difficult, current benchmark methods exploit
the fact that such functions often belong to certain classes of holomorphic

on providing theoretical approximation guarantees for the class of

of vacuum in the voids. The hope that there could indeed be such a low tension
S of the domain wall between these two phases, that it would not totally upset
cosmology is based on our dark matter model. In this model dark matter consists
of pearls or bubbles of a new vacuum phase, with ordinary matter inside it
under very high pressure. The order of magnitude of cubic root S of order MeV
or 100 MeV could make such domain walls astronomically viable. We successfully
estimate the order of magnitude of the variations in the fine structure
constant in different places astronomically, but the similar variations in
proton mass over electron mass should have been much bigger than seen
experimentally in our model. The Universe s surprisingly early galaxies seen by
JWST, James Webb telescope, may agree well with our model. Replacing the usual
cosmological constant by domain walls in the standard cosmological model would
lead to a cubic root of the tension being cubic root of S of order 30 MeV.

selected sample and then extends the search tree by flow or jump, which is also
chosen randomly when both regimes are possible. In addition, HySST maintains a
static set of witness points such that all the vertices within the neighborhood
of each witness are pruned except the vertex with the lowest cost. Through a
definition of concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, we
show that HySST is asymptotically near optimal, namely, the probability of
failing to find a motion plan such that its cost is close to the optimal cost
approaches zero as the number of iterations of the algorithm increases to
infinity. This property is guaranteed under mild conditions on the data
defining the motion plan, which include a relaxation of the usual positive

we investigate the limits of these models across three representative

compositional tasks as computation graphs to systematically quantify the level

Our empirical findings suggest that Transformers solve compositional tasks by
reducing multi-step compositional reasoning into linearized subgraph matching,
without necessarily developing systematic problem-solving skills. To round off
our empirical study, we provide theoretical arguments on abstract multi-step
reasoning problems that highlight how Transformers' performance will rapidly

search (SLS) and stochastic Polyak step size (SPS), for computing both the
upper and lower-level learning rates. First, we revisit the use of SLS and SPS
in single-level optimization without the additional interpolation condition
that is typically assumed in prior works. For such settings, we investigate new
variants of SLS and SPS that improve upon existing suggestions in the
literature and are simpler to implement. Importantly, these two variants can be
seen as special instances of general family of methods with an envelope-type
step-size. This unified envelope strategy allows for the extension of the
algorithms and their convergence guarantees to BO settings. Finally, our
extensive experiments demonstrate that the new algorithms, which are available
in both SGD and Adam versions, can find large learning rates with minimal
tuning and converge faster than corresponding vanilla SGD or Adam BO algorithms
that require fine-tuning.

synthesizing high-quality images conditioned on text prompts. Recent methods
have tried to replicate the success by either training text-to-video (T2V)
models on a very large number of text-video pairs or adapting T2I models on
text-video pairs independently. Although the latter is computationally less
expensive, it still takes a significant amount of time for per-video adaption.
To address this issue, we propose SAVE, a novel spectral-shift-aware adaptation
framework, in which we fine-tune the spectral shift of the parameter space
instead of the parameters themselves. Specifically, we take the spectral
decomposition of the pre-trained T2I weights and only control the change in the
corresponding singular values, i.e. spectral shift, while freezing the
corresponding singular vectors. To avoid drastic drift from the original T2I
weights, we introduce a spectral shift regularizer that confines the spectral
shift to be more restricted for large singular values and more relaxed for
small singular values. Since we are only dealing with spectral shifts, the
proposed method reduces the adaptation time significantly (approx. 10 times)
and has fewer resource constrains for training. Such attributes posit SAVE to
be more suitable for real-world applications, e.g. editing undesirable content
during video streaming. We validate the effectiveness of SAVE with an extensive
experimental evaluation under different settings, e.g. style transfer, object
replacement, privacy preservation, etc.

the wavefunction renormalization in which a tower of states are integrated out.
Assuming these two conjectures, we explore the role of a tower of states
coupled to the modulus in (in)stability of the de Sitter (dS) vacuum by
studying the one-loop effective potential generated by a tower of states. We
find that a fermionic tower of states makes the effective potential more or
less consistent with the dS swampland conjecture : either the slope or the
curvature of the potential is sizeable. In contrast, the effective potential
generated by a bosonic tower of states seems to allow the stable dS vacuum.
Therefore, in order to argue the instability of the dS vacuum, the additional

fine-tuning to existing methods to allow them to adapt to evolving TKG data,
this can lead to forgetting previously learned patterns. Alternatively,
retraining the model with the entire updated TKG can mitigate forgetting but is
computationally burdensome. To address these challenges, we propose a general

repurposing of less important model parameters for learning new knowledge, and
(ii) a clustering-based experience replay that reinforces the past knowledge by
selectively preserving only a small portion of the past data. Our experimental

typically subject to mixing due to mass and kinetic terms, which can influence
the solution using stochastic dynamics. Focusing on the fact that the QCD axion

dynamics of the QCD axion and another axion with mixing. We find that the QCD
axion abundance is significantly enhanced and becomes larger than that of the

decay constant, the pion mass, and the $\eta$ mass in the low-energy regime of
QC$_2$D. Based on the identities, we numerically evaluate the topological
susceptibility at finite quark chemical potential using the linear sigma model
with the approximate Pauli-Gursey $SU(4)$ symmetry. Our findings indicate that,
in the absence of $U(1)_A$ anomaly effects represented by the
Kobayashi-Maskawa-'t Hooft-type determinant interaction, the topological
susceptibility vanishes in both the hadronic and baryon superfluid phases. On
the other hand, when the $U(1)_A$ anomaly effects are present, the constant and
nonzero topological susceptibility is induced in the hadronic phase, reflecting
the mass difference between the pion and $\eta$ meson. Meanwhile, in the
superfluid phase it begins to decrease smoothly. The asymptotic behavior of the
decrement is fitted by the continuous reduction of the chiral condensate in
dense QC$_2$D, which is similar to the behavior observed in hot three-color QCD

geometric relaxation results in a surface strain that scales with the average

combination of GNNs with residual connections or neural ordinary differential
equations (ODE). However, current graph ODE models face two key limitations in
feature extraction: (1) they lean towards global temporal patterns, overlooking
local patterns that are important for unexpected events; and (2) they lack
dynamic semantic edges in their architectural design. In this paper, we propose
a novel architecture called Graph-based Multi-ODE Neural Networks (GRAM-ODE)
which is designed with multiple connective ODE-GNN modules to learn better
representations by capturing different views of complex local and global
dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies. We also add some techniques like shared
weights and divergence constraints into the intermediate layers of distinct
ODE-GNN modules to further improve their communication towards the forecasting
task. Our extensive set of experiments conducted on six real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of GRAM-ODE compared with state-of-the-art
baselines as well as the contribution of different components to the overall
performance. The code is available at https://github.com/zbliu98/GRAM-ODE

dual quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) in a one-dimensional

remarkably high conversion efficiency of $3.66\times10^{-2}$ (five orders of

small full-width at half-maximum less than 0.2 nm. The SFG efficiency can be
tuned via adjusting the grating geometry parameter or choosing the input beam
polarization combination. Furthermore, the generated SFG signal can be
maintained at a fixed wavelength without the appreciable loss of efficiency by
selectively exciting the angle-dependent quasi-BICs, even if the wavelengths of

PRESTO, a relaxation of the proportional odds model for ordinal regression.
Instead of estimating weights for one separating hyperplane that is shifted by
separate intercepts for each of the estimated Bayes decision boundaries between
adjacent pairs of categorical responses, we estimate separate weights for each

estimates the decision boundary weights under a sparsity assumption. Synthetic

computing. Recently, neural network approximation of PDEs has received
increasing attention due to its flexible meshless discretization and its
potential for high-dimensional problems. One fundamental numerical difficulty
is that random samples in the training set introduce statistical errors into
the discretization of loss functional which may become the dominant error in
the final approximation, and therefore overshadow the modeling capability of
the neural network. In this work, we propose a new minmax formulation to
optimize simultaneously the approximate solution, given by a neural network
model, and the random samples in the training set, provided by a deep
generative model. The key idea is to use a deep generative model to adjust
random samples in the training set such that the residual induced by the
approximate PDE solution can maintain a smooth profile when it is being
minimized. Such an idea is achieved by implicitly embedding the Wasserstein
distance between the residual-induced distribution and the uniform distribution
into the loss, which is then minimized together with the residual. A nearly
uniform residual profile means that its variance is small for any normalized
weight function such that the Monte Carlo approximation error of the loss
functional is reduced significantly for a certain sample size. The adversarial
adaptive sampling (AAS) approach proposed in this work is the first attempt to
formulate two essential components, minimizing the residual and seeking the
optimal training set, into one minmax objective functional for the neural

designing algorithms and computing systems wherein the accuracy of correctness
of algorithms executing on them is deliberately traded for significant resource
savings. Significant progress has been reported in this regard both in terms of
hardware as well as software or custom algorithms that exploited this approach
resulting in some loss in solution quality (accuracy) while garnering
disproportionately high savings. However, these approaches tended to be ad-hoc
and were tied to specific algorithms and technologies. Consequently, a
principled approach to designing and analyzing algorithms was lacking.
  In this paper, we provide a novel model which allows us to characterize the
behavior of algorithms designed to be inexact, as well as characterize
opportunities and benefits that this approach offers. Our methods therefore are
amenable to standard asymptotic analysis and provides a clean unified
abstraction through which an algorithm's design and analysis can be conducted.
With this as a backdrop, we show that inexactness can be significantly
beneficial for some fundamental problems in that the quality of a solution can
be exponentially better if one exploits inexactness when compared to approaches
that are agnostic and are unable to exploit this approach. We show that such
gains are possible in the context of evaluating Boolean functions rooted in the

Formally, this is accomplished by introducing the twin concepts of inexactness

remove degradation with uniform spatial distribution and constant intensity,
making insufficient use of degradation prior knowledge. Here we bootstrap the

spatially variable, through utilizing prior knowledge from degraded images.
Specifically, we propose an ingenious and efficient multi-frame image
restoration network (DparNet) with wide & deep architecture, which integrates
degraded images and prior knowledge of degradation to reconstruct images with
ideal clarity and stability. The degradation prior is directly learned from
degraded images in form of key degradation parameter matrix, with no

enables the learned parameters to directly modulate the final restoring
results, boosting spatial & intensity adaptive image restoration. We
demonstrate the proposed method on two representative image restoration
applications: image denoising and suppression of atmospheric turbulence effects
in images. Two large datasets, containing 109,536 and 49,744 images
respectively, were constructed to support our experiments. The experimental
results show that our DparNet significantly outperform SoTA methods in
restoration performance and network efficiency. More importantly, by utilizing
the learned degradation parameters via wide & deep learning, we can improve the
PSNR of image restoration by 0.6~1.1 dB with less than 2% increasing in model

analysis in the discovery of long-term geomorphic evolution. To highlight the
areas of semantic changes, previous effort mostly pays attention to learning
representative feature descriptors of a single image, while the difference
information is either modeled with simple difference operations or implicitly
embedded via feature interactions. Nevertheless, such difference modeling can
be noisy since it suffers from non-semantic changes and lacks explicit guidance
from image content or context. In this paper, we revisit the importance of
feature difference for change detection in RSI, and propose a series of
operations to fully exploit the difference information: Alignment, Perturbation
and Decoupling (APD). Firstly, alignment leverages contextual similarity to
compensate for the non-semantic difference in feature space. Next, a difference
module trained with semantic-wise perturbation is adopted to learn more
generalized change estimators, which reversely bootstraps feature extraction
and prediction. Finally, a decoupled dual-decoder structure is designed to
predict semantic changes in both content-aware and content-agnostic manners.

constant abundance ratios independently of the evolutionary stages, suggesting
that amides related chemistry is triggered in early evolutionary stages of

of steering the state distributions of all agents of a VLMAS to prescribed

the key assumption that such systems often admit a multi-level hierarchical
clustered structure - where the agents are organized into cliques of different
levels - we associate the control of such cliques with the control of
distributions, and introduce the Distributed Hierarchical Distribution Control
(DHDC) framework. The proposed approach consists of two sub-frameworks. The
first one, Distributed Hierarchical Distribution Estimation (DHDE), is a
bottom-up hierarchical decentralized algorithm which links the initial and

formulated as a binary classification problem. It is a challenging problem in
data integration due to the heterogeneity of data representations.
State-of-the-art solutions have adopted NLP techniques based on pre-trained
language models (PrLMs) via the fine-tuning paradigm, however, sequential
fine-tuning of overparameterized PrLMs can lead to catastrophic forgetting,
especially in low-resource scenarios. In this study, we propose a
parameter-efficient paradigm for fine-tuning PrLMs based on adapters, small
neural networks encapsulated between layers of a PrLM, by optimizing only the
adapter and classifier weights while the PrLMs parameters are frozen.
Adapter-based methods have been successfully applied to multilingual speech
problems achieving promising results, however, the effectiveness of these
methods when applied to EM is not yet well understood, particularly for
generalized EM with heterogeneous data. Furthermore, we explore using (i)
pre-trained adapters and (ii) invertible adapters to capture token-level
language representations and demonstrate their benefits for transfer learning
on the generalized EM benchmark. Our results show that our solution achieves
comparable or superior performance to full-scale PrLM fine-tuning and
prompt-tuning baselines while utilizing a significantly smaller computational
footprint $\approx 13\%$ of the PrLM parameters.

generated images instead of cover images. Existing studies on generative
steganography use GAN or Flow models to obtain high hiding message capacity and
anti-detection ability over cover images. However, they create relatively
unrealistic stego images because of the inherent limitations of generative
models. We propose Diffusion-Stego, a generative steganography approach based
on diffusion models which outperform other generative models in image
generation. Diffusion-Stego projects secret messages into latent noise of
diffusion models and generates stego images with an iterative denoising
process. Since the naive hiding of secret messages into noise boosts visual
degradation and decreases extracted message accuracy, we introduce message
projection, which hides messages into noise space while addressing these
issues. We suggest three options for message projection to adjust the trade-off
between extracted message accuracy, anti-detection ability, and image quality.
Diffusion-Stego is a training-free approach, so we can apply it to pre-trained
diffusion models which generate high-quality images, or even large-scale
text-to-image models, such as Stable diffusion. Diffusion-Stego achieved a high
capacity of messages (3.0 bpp of binary messages with 98% accuracy, and 6.0 bpp
with 90% accuracy) as well as high quality (with a FID score of 2.77 for 1.0
bpp on the FFHQ 64$\times$64 dataset) that makes it challenging to distinguish

pipeline called Real-world Image Variation by ALignment (RIVAL) that utilizes
diffusion models to generate image variations from a single image exemplar. Our
pipeline enhances the generation quality of image variations by aligning the
image generation process to the source image's inversion chain. Specifically,
we demonstrate that step-wise latent distribution alignment is essential for
generating high-quality variations. To attain this, we design a cross-image
self-attention injection for feature interaction and a step-wise distribution
normalization to align the latent features. Incorporating these alignment
processes into a diffusion model allows RIVAL to generate high-quality image
variations without further parameter optimization. Our experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods with
respect to semantic-condition similarity and perceptual quality. Furthermore,
this generalized inference pipeline can be easily applied to other

attractive to extend hybrid learning for the computer vision tasks by
seamlessly integrating structured knowledge with data samples to achieve more

for channel estimation, the proposed VAE differs from the original VAE in two
aspects. First, the encoder is a dual-path neural network, where one path uses
the received signal to estimate the path gains and path angles, and another
uses the correlation matrix of the received signal to estimate AoAs. Second,
the decoder has fixed weights that implement the signal propagation model,
instead of learnable parameters. This knowledge-aware decoder forces the
encoder to output meaningful physical parameters of interests (i.e., path
gains, path angles, and AoAs), which cannot be achieved by original VAE.
Rigorous analysis is carried out to characterize the multiple global optima and
local optima of the estimation problem, which motivates the design of the

current quantum technology, mainly because of their industrial relevance, the
difficulty of solving large instances of them classically, and their
equivalence to Ising Hamiltonians using the quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation. Many of these applications have inequality
constraints, usually encoded as penalization terms in the QUBO formulation
using additional variables known as slack variables. The slack variables have
two disadvantages: (i) these variables extend the search space of optimal and
suboptimal solutions, and (ii) the variables add extra qubits and connections
to the quantum algorithm. Recently, a new method known as unbalanced
penalization has been presented to avoid using slack variables. This method
offers a trade-off between additional slack variables to ensure that the
optimal solution is given by the ground state of the Ising Hamiltonian, and
using an unbalanced heuristic function to penalize the region where the
inequality constraint is violated with the only certainty that the optimal
solution will be in the vicinity of the ground state. This work tests the
unbalanced penalization method using real quantum hardware on D-Wave Advantage
for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The results show that the unbalanced
penalization method outperforms the solutions found using slack variables and
sets a new record for the largest TSP solved with quantum technology.

bias towards learning simpler solutions. This makes them highly prone to
learning simple spurious features that are highly correlated with a label

that, interestingly, the simplicity bias of gradient descent can be leveraged
to identify spurious correlations, early in training. First, we prove on a
two-layer neural network, that groups of examples with high spurious
correlation are separable based on the model's output, in the initial training
iterations. We further show that if spurious features have a small enough
noise-to-signal ratio, the network's output on the majority of examples in a
class will be almost exclusively determined by the spurious features and will
be nearly invariant to the core feature. Finally, we propose SPARE, which
separates large groups with spurious correlations early in training, and
utilizes importance sampling to alleviate the spurious correlation, by
balancing the group sizes. We show that SPARE achieves up to 5.6% higher
worst-group accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, while being up to 12x
faster. We also show the applicability of SPARE to discover and mitigate

with good calibration properties; the intuition being that for such losses, the
global optimum is to predict the ground-truth probabilities, which is indeed
calibrated. However, typical machine learning models are trained to
approximately minimize loss over restricted families of predictors, that are
unlikely to contain the ground truth. Under what circumstances does optimizing
proper loss over a restricted family yield calibrated models? What precise
calibration guarantees does it give? In this work, we provide a rigorous answer
to these questions. We replace the global optimality with a local optimality
condition stipulating that the (proper) loss of the predictor cannot be reduced
much by post-processing its predictions with a certain family of Lipschitz
functions. We show that any predictor with this local optimality satisfies
smooth calibration as defined in Kakade-Foster (2008), B{\l}asiok et al.
(2023). Local optimality is plausibly satisfied by well-trained DNNs, which
suggests an explanation for why they are calibrated from proper loss
minimization alone. Finally, we show that the connection between local
optimality and calibration error goes both ways: nearly calibrated predictors
are also nearly locally optimal.

such control by learning disentangled representations for colour and geometry.
The geometry is represented by an image intensity mapping that identifies

portable and enables precise control of energy levels, balancing depth and

transmission band suffers from poor penetrating capability and generates noise
that interferes with root detection. The proposed time-frequency filtering
technique uses a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to track changes in
frequency spectrum density over time. To obtain the filter window, a weighted
linear regression (WLR) method is used. By adopting a conversion method that is
a variant of the chirp Z-Transform (CZT), the timefrequency window filters out
frequency samples that are not of interest when doing the frequency-to-time
domain data conversion. The proposed depth-adaptive filter window can
selfadjust to different scenarios, making it independent of soil information
and effectively determines subsurface tree roots. The technique is successfully
validated using SFCW GPR data from actual sites in a tropical area with
different soil moisture levels, and the two-dimensional (2D) radar map of
subsurface root systems is highly improved compared to existing methods.

Most pioneering works for user targeting tasks commonly perform

and the unfriendliness of black-box procedures towards marketers. In this
paper, we design an Entity Graph Learning (EGL) system to provide explainable

EGL System follows the hybrid online-offline architecture to satisfy the
requirements of scalability and timeliness. Specifically, in the offline stage,
the system focuses on the heavyweight entity graph construction and user entity
preference learning, in which we propose a Three-stage Relation Mining

stage, the system offers the ability of user targeting in real-time based on
the entity graph from the offline stage. Since the user targeting process is
based on graph reasoning, the whole process is transparent and
operation-friendly to marketers. Finally, extensive offline experiments and
online A/B testing demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed EGL

technology for image recognition. In the framework of VCM, both higher image
recognition accuracy and video compression performance are required. In this
paper, we propose an extention scheme of video coding for object detection
using Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Unlike video for human vision, video used
for object detection does not require a large image size or high contrast.
Since downsampling of the image can reduce the amount of information to be
transmitted. Due to the decrease in image contrast, entropy of the image
becomes smaller. Therefore, in our proposed scheme, the original image is
reduced in size and contrast, then coded with VVC encoder to achieve high
compression performance. Then, the output image from the VVC decoder is
restored to its original image size using the bicubic method. Experimental
results show that the proposed video coding scheme achieves better coding
performance than regular VVC in terms of object detection accuracy.

subset sampling problem aims to sample a subset $T \subseteq S$, such that
every $x_i$ is independently included in $S$ with probability $p_i$. A naive
solution is to flip a coin for each event, which takes $O(n)$ time. However,
the specific goal is to develop data structures that allow drawing a sample in
time proportional to the expected output size $\mu=\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)$, which
can be significantly smaller than $n$ in many applications. The subset sampling
problem serves as an important building block in many tasks and has been the
subject of various research for more than a decade. However, most of the
existing subset sampling approaches are conducted in a static setting, where
the events or their associated probability in set $S$ is not allowed to be

considering a general purpose architecture, we analyze prompt tuning from the
lens of both: universal approximation and limitations with finite-depth
fixed-weight pretrained transformers for continuous-valued functions. Our
universality result guarantees the existence of a strong transformer with a
prompt to approximate any sequence-to-sequence function in the set of Lipschitz

result with the number of parameters required for a low-rank update (based on
LoRA) for a single-layer setting. We finally extend our analysis to multi-layer

Boltzmann's model of an ideal gas, recombination in population genetics and
genetic algorithms. In the context of spin systems, it is a natural
generalization of linear dynamics based on Markov chains, such as Glauber
dynamics and block dynamics, which are by now well understood. However, the
inherent nonlinearity makes the dynamics much harder to analyze, and rigorous
quantitative results so far are limited to processes which converge to
essentially trivial stationary distributions that are product measures. In this
paper we provide the first quantitative convergence analysis for natural
nonlinear dynamics in a combinatorial setting where the stationary distribution
contains non-trivial correlations, namely the Ising model at high temperatures.
We prove that nonlinear versions of both the Glauber dynamics and the block

pruned estimates obtained using our new Magnitude-Based compression algorithm
are close to the unpruned functions with high probability, which improves the
first criteria. Using Sparse Matrix Sketching, the space of the pruned matrices
can be efficiently represented in the space of dense matrices of much smaller

ground in the algorithm development for pruning and bounding generalization

$E_0$ and the spectra of variable stars by periods is carried out in order to
establish the causes of irregularities in the spectrum of PCR by $E_0$. The
study was performed using the public database of the KASCADE-Grande experiment
and GCVS and ZTF variable star catalogues. It has been suggested that the
acceleration of PCR to high and super-high energies occurs not only on the
shock waves of supernovae, but also in bursts of giants and super-giants. The
relationship between the periods of variable stars and the maximum energy $E_0$
of the nuclei of PCRs generated by these types of stars is shown.
Irregularities in the PCR spectrum by $E_0$ are associated with the transition
from one dominant stars type to another as $E_0$ increases. The knee in the PCR
spectrum at $E_0~=~3-5~PeV$ is associated with a decrease in the contribution
of SRB variability stars and a further increase in the contribution of Mira
variable stars to the PCR flux. The bump in the PCR spectrum with a maximum at
$E_0~=~80~PeV$, established in the KASCADE-Grande experiment, is formed by
giant stars and super-giants of the Mira and SRC variability.

treat the presence of redundant data, such as noise, within their training set

use temporally weakly supervised learning, which only requires providing labels
on a coarse scale. This study explores the limits of DNN training using
temporally weak labeling with applications in KWS. We train a simple end-to-end

difficulty by randomly appending and adding noise to the training dataset. Our
results indicate that temporally weak labeling can achieve comparable results

localize and extract target keywords without explicit supervision, leading to a

ingredient of the logic are path quantifiers specifying that some coalition of
agents has a joint strategy to enforce a given goal. This basic setup has been
extended to let some of the agents (revocably) commit to using certain named
strategies, as in ATL with explicit strategies (ATLES). In the present work, we
extend ATLES with fixpoint operators and strategy disjunction, arriving at the
alternating-time $\mu$-calculus with disjunctive explicit strategies (AMCDES),
which allows for a more flexible formulation of temporal properties (e.g.
fairness) and, through strategy disjunction, a form of controlled
nondeterminism in commitments. Our main result is an ExpTime upper bound for
satisfiability checking (which is thus ExpTime-complete). We also prove upper
bounds QP (quasipolynomial time) and NP $\cap$ coNP for model checking under

Our key technical tool is a treatment of the AMCDES within the generic

effectively perceiving anomalies. To address this issue and achieve balanced

novel framework called AnoOnly (Anomaly Only). Unlike existing SSAD methods
that resort to strict loss supervision, AnoOnly suspends it and introduces a
form of weak supervision for normal data. This weak supervision is instantiated
through the utilization of batch normalization, which implicitly performs
cluster learning on normal data. When integrated into existing SSAD methods,
the proposed AnoOnly demonstrates remarkable performance enhancements across
various models and datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance.
Additionally, our AnoOnly is natively robust to label noise when suffering from

the generator matrices to a polynomial recurrence relation, and derive a closed

conclusion is that it is very difficult in practice to achieve the theoretical

based on Maxwell's equations that studied the impact of electromagnetic waves

into a dense or porous solid. This transformation involves several physical

flow. As a result, the solute forming a dried deposit exhibits unique patterns
and often displays structural defects like desiccation cracks, buckling, or

results by accurately capturing users' dynamic interests from historical

studies have begun integrating reinforcement learning (RL) into these models.
Framing sequential recommendation as an RL problem with reward signals, unlocks
developing recommender systems (RS) that consider a vital aspect-incorporating
direct user feedback in the form of rewards to deliver a more personalized
experience. Nonetheless, employing RL algorithms presents challenges, including
off-policy training, expansive combinatorial action spaces, and the scarcity of
datasets with sufficient reward signals. Contemporary approaches have attempted
to combine RL and sequential modeling, incorporating contrastive-based
objectives and negative sampling strategies for training the RL component. In
this study, we further emphasize the efficacy of contrastive-based objectives
paired with augmentation to address datasets with extended horizons.
Additionally, we recognize the potential instability issues that may arise
during the application of negative sampling. These challenges primarily stem
from the data imbalance prevalent in real-world datasets, which is a common
issue in offline RL contexts. While our established baselines attempt to
mitigate this through various techniques, instability remains an issue.

content information in speech. Current mainstream neural-network speaker
anonymization systems disentangle speech into prosody-related, content, and
speaker representations. The speaker representation is then anonymized by a
selection-based speaker anonymizer that uses a mean vector over a set of
randomly selected speaker vectors from an external pool of English speakers.
However, the resulting anonymized vectors are subject to severe privacy leakage
against powerful attackers, reduction in speaker diversity, and language
mismatch problems for unseen language speaker anonymization. To generate
diverse, language-neutral speaker vectors, this paper proposes an anonymizer
based on an orthogonal Householder neural network (OHNN). Specifically, the
OHNN acts like a rotation to transform the original speaker vectors into
anonymized speaker vectors, which are constrained to follow the distribution
over the original speaker vector space. A basic classification loss is
introduced to ensure that anonymized speaker vectors from different speakers
have unique speaker identities. To further protect speaker identities, an
improved classification loss and similarity loss are used to push
original-anonymized sample pairs away from each other. Experiments on
VoicePrivacy Challenge datasets in English and the AISHELL-3 dataset in

of instruments and the practices they make possible-underlying this
development. It is described through the collaboration and communication
processes between computer science scholars and humanities scholars in finding
new ways of visualizing complex datasets for exploration and presentation in
the realm of film-studies research. It draws on the outcome and concrete usage
of the visualizations in publications and presentations of a research group,
the AdAproject, that investigates the audiovisual rhetorics of affect in
audiovisual media on the financial crisis (2007-). These film analyses are
based on theoretical assumptions on the process of film-viewing, the relation
of the viewer's perception and the temporally unfolding audiovisual images, and
a methodical approach that draws on 'steps' in the research process such as
segmentation, description and qualification, called eMAEX (Kappelhoff et al.
2011-2016) to reconstruct these experiential figurations (Bakels et al. 2020a,

visualizations as interactive interfaces generated with the open-source
software Advene, that were an integral part of the research process. In this
regard, the timeline visualization is not only of interest for visual
argumentation in (digital) humanities publications, but also for the creation
of annotations as well as the exploration of this data. In the first part of
the paper we describe this interdisciplinary collaboration as instrumental

autonomous driving, offering a viable and cost-effective alternative to
LiDAR-based solutions. However, existing multi-camera algorithms primarily rely
on monocular image pre-training, which overlooks the spatial and temporal
correlations among different camera views. To address this limitation, we
propose the first multi-camera unified pre-training framework called Occ-BEV,
which involves initially reconstructing the 3D scene as the foundational stage
and subsequently fine-tuning the model on downstream tasks. Specifically, a 3D
decoder is designed for leveraging Bird's Eye View (BEV) features from
multi-view images to predict the 3D geometric occupancy to enable the model to
capture a more comprehensive understanding of the 3D environment. A significant
benefit of Occ-BEV is its capability of utilizing a considerable volume of
unlabeled image-LiDAR pairs for pre-training purposes. The proposed
multi-camera unified pre-training framework demonstrates promising results in
key tasks such as multi-camera 3D object detection and surrounding semantic
scene completion. When compared to monocular pre-training methods on the
nuScenes dataset, Occ-BEV shows a significant improvement of about 2.0% in mAP
and 2.0% in NDS for multi-camera 3D object detection, as well as a 3% increase
in mIoU for surrounding semantic scene completion. Codes are publicly available

diagnosis. However, acquiring dense annotations of such images for training is
labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, Semi-Supervised
Learning (SSL) has the potential for reducing the annotation cost, but it is
challenged by a large number of unlabeled training images. In this paper, we
propose a novel SSL method based on Cross Distillation of Multiple Attentions
(CDMA) to effectively leverage unlabeled images. Firstly, we propose a
Multi-attention Tri-branch Network (MTNet) that consists of an encoder and a
three-branch decoder, with each branch using a different attention mechanism
that calibrates features in different aspects to generate diverse outputs.
Secondly, we introduce Cross Decoder Knowledge Distillation (CDKD) between the
three decoder branches, allowing them to learn from each other's soft labels to
mitigate the negative impact of incorrect pseudo labels in training.
Additionally, uncertainty minimization is applied to the average prediction of
the three branches, which further regularizes predictions on unlabeled images
and encourages inter-branch consistency. Our proposed CDMA was compared with
eight state-of-the-art SSL methods on the public DigestPath dataset, and the
experimental results showed that our method outperforms the other approaches

the potential of different neuroimaging features as autism biomarkers. The

distinct features across three imaging types, the model shows promising
results, achieving an accuracy of 95.4% and outperforming metrics of current

identified and classified as candidate biomarkers using an independent samples
t-test, in which functional features such as neural activity and connectivity
in various brain regions exhibited the highest differences in the mean values
between individuals with autism and typical control subjects. The p-values of
these biomarkers were < 0.001, proving the statistical significance of the
results and indicating that this research could pave the way towards the usage
of neuroimaging in conjunction with behavioral criteria in clinics.
Furthermore, the salient features discovered in the brain structure of
individuals with autism could lead to a more profound understanding of the
underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the disorder, which remains one of the
most substantial enigmas in the field even today.

alike, with high-profile cyber security incidents regularly making headlines.
Many different detection systems have been proposed as solutions to the
ever-changing dynamic landscape of ransomware detection. In the majority of
cases, these described systems propose a method based on the result of a single
test performed on either the executable code, the process under investigation,
its behaviour, or its output. In a small subset of ransomware detection
systems, the concept of a scorecard is employed where multiple tests are
performed on various aspects of a process under investigation and their results
are then analysed using machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to
propose a new majority voting approach to ransomware detection by developing a
method that uses a cumulative score derived from discrete tests based on
calculations using algorithmic rather than heuristic techniques. The paper
describes 23 candidate tests, as well as 9 Windows API tests which are
validated to determine both their accuracy and viability for use within a
ransomware detection system. Using a cumulative score calculation approach to
ransomware detection has several benefits, such as the immunity to the
occasional inaccuracy of individual tests when making its final classification.
The system can also leverage multiple tests that can be both comprehensive and
complimentary in an attempt to achieve a broader, deeper, and more robust
analysis of the program under investigation. Additionally, the use of multiple
collaborative tests also significantly hinders ransomware from masking or
modifying its behaviour in an attempt to bypass detection.

  stars","29 pages",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Binary molecules such as CO, OH, CH, CN, and C$_2$ are often used as
abundance indicators in stars. These species are usually assumed to be formed
in chemical equilibrium. The time-dependent effects of hydrodynamics can affect
the formation and dissociation of these species and may lead to deviations from
chemical equilibrium. We aim to model departures from chemical equilibrium in
dwarf stellar atmospheres by considering time-dependent chemical kinetics
alongside hydrodynamics and radiation transfer. We examine the effects of a
decreasing metallicity and an altered C/O ratio on the chemistry when compared
to the equilibrium state. We used the radiation-(magneto)hydrodynamics code
CO5BOLD, and its own chemical solver to solve for the chemistry of 15 species
and 83 reactions. The species were treated as passive tracers and were advected
by the velocity field. The steady-state chemistry was also computed to isolate
the effects of hydrodynamics.
  In most of the photospheres in the models we present, the mean deviations are
smaller than $0.2$ dex, and they generally appear above $\log{\tau} = -2$. The
deviations increase with height because the chemical timescales become longer
with decreasing density and temperature. A reduced metallicity similarly
results in longer chemical timescales and in a reduction in yield that is
proportional to the drop in metallicity; a decrease by a factor $100$ in
metallicity loosely corresponds to an increase by factor $100$ in chemical
timescales. As both CH and OH are formed along reaction pathways to CO, the C/O
ratio means that the more abundant element gives faster timescales to the
constituent molecular species. Overall, the carbon enhancement phenomenon seen
in very metal-poor stars is not a result of an improper treatment of molecular
chemistry for stars up to a metallicity as low as [Fe/H] = $-3.0$.

locally uniformly positive in long-time. In contrast with the scalar case,
multiple space-time periodic uniformly positive entire solutions might coexist.
When another, possibly smaller, generalized principal eigenvalue is
nonnegative, then on the contrary all solutions to the Cauchy problem vanish
uniformly and the zero solution is the unique space-time periodic nonnegative
entire solution. When the two generalized principal eigenvalues differ and zero
is in between, the long-time behavior depends on the decay at infinity of the
initial data. Finally, with similar arguments, a Freidlin--G{\""a}rtner-type

have to be allocated to agents who have a fixed utility/cost for each assigned
item so to maximize/minimize some objective. This framework captures a broad
range of fundamental problems such as the Santa Claus problem (maximizing
minimum utility), Nash welfare maximization (maximizing geometric mean of
utilities), makespan minimization (minimizing maximum cost), minimization of
$\ell_p$-norms, and so on. We focus on divisible items (i.e., fractional
allocations) in this paper. Even for divisible items, these problems are
characterized by strong super-constant lower bounds in the classical worst-case
online model.
  In this paper, we study online allocations in the {\em learning-augmented}
setting, i.e., where the algorithm has access to some additional
(machine-learned) information about the problem instance. We introduce a {\em
general} algorithmic framework for learning-augmented online allocation that
produces nearly optimal solutions for this broad range of maximization and
minimization objectives using only a single learned parameter for every agent.
As corollaries of our general framework, we improve prior results of Lattanzi

The aim of the present paper is to prove that these counter-terms are position
independent (i.e. constants) for a particular choice of renormalization
conditions. We investigate this problem by decomposing the correlation
functions into a bulk part, which is defined as the $\phi^4_4$ theory on the
full space $\mathbb{R}^4$ with an interaction supported on the half-space, plus
a remainder which we call ""the surface part"". We analyse this surface part and
establish perturbatively that the $\phi^4_4$ theory in
$\mathbb{R}^+\times\mathbb{R}^3$ is made finite by adding the bulk
counter-terms and two additional counter-terms to the bare interaction in the
case of Robin and Neumann boundary conditions. These surface counter-terms are
position independent and are proportional to $\int_S \phi^2$ and $\int_S
\phi\partial_n\phi$. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, we prove that no
surface counter-terms are needed and the bulk counter-terms are sufficient to
renormalize the connected amputated (Dirichlet) Schwinger functions. A key
technical novelty as compared to our previous work is a proof that the power
counting of the surface part of the correlation functions is better by one

theoretical evidence, we demonstrate how CoT significantly reduces the sample
complexity of in-context learning (ICL) and facilitates the learning of complex
functions that non-CoT methods struggle with. Furthermore, we illustrate how
transformers can transition from vanilla in-context learning to mastering a
compositional function with CoT by simply incorporating an additional layer
that performs the necessary filtering for CoT via the attention mechanism. In
addition to these test-time benefits, we highlight how CoT accelerates
pretraining by learning shortcuts to represent complex functions and how
filtering plays an important role in pretraining. These findings collectively
provide insights into the mechanics of CoT, inviting further investigation of
its role in complex reasoning tasks.

acquisition from different angles; however, its field-of-view (FOV) is
primarily constrained by the size of the detector when aiming for high spatial
resolution imaging. Recently, we introduced a novel scanning mode called
multiple source translation CT (mSTCT), which effectively enlarges the FOV of
the micro-CT system. Furthermore, we developed a virtual projection-based

albeit with a trade-off in acquisition efficiency (high resolution
reconstruction typically requires thousands of source samplings). In this
paper, we present a new algorithm for mSTCT reconstruction,
backprojection-filtration (BPF), which enables reconstructions of
high-resolution images with a low source sampling ratio. Additionally, we found
that implementing derivatives in BPF along different directions (source and
detector) yields two distinct BPF algorithms (S-BPF and D-BPF), each with its
own reconstruction performance characteristics. Through simulated and real
experiments conducted in this paper, we demonstrate that achieving same
high-resolution reconstructions, D-BPF can reduce source sampling by 75%
compared with V-FBP. S-BPF shares similar characteristics with V-FBP, where the
spatial resolution is primarily influenced by the source sampling.

of sentence vector representations of news headlines in a mixed semantic space

distillation techniques to fit two semantic spaces into a mixed semantic space.
We abandon traditional static clustering methods like K-Means and AGNES in
favor of the incremental clustering algorithm Single-Pass, which we further
modify to better suit cross-lingual news clustering scenarios. Our main
contributions are as follows: (1) We adopt the English standard BERT as the
teacher model and XLM-Roberta as the student model, training a cross-lingual
model through knowledge distillation that can represent sentence-level
bilingual texts in both Chinese and English. (2) We use the LDA topic model to
represent news as a combina-tion of cross-lingual vectors for headlines and

topic similarity to address the cross-lingual issue in news content
representation. (3) We adapt the Single-Pass clustering algorithm for the news

been observed that Omori's law can be viewed as a solution to a differential
equation describing the evolution of aftershocks. An alternative way of
describing is based on Utsu law, which states that the frequency of aftershocks
decreases with time according to a power law. The presented paper is polemical.
We discuss the issue of the applicability of each of the three alternative ways
of describing aftershocks. The Omori law has a limited scope. The law is valid
only in the so-called Omori epoch, after which the earthquake source undergoes
a bifurcation. In the Omori epoch, the Utsu law is also valid, but it does not
differ in this epoch from the Omori law. The general conclusion is that the
existence of the Omori epoch and the phenomenon of bifurcation exclude the
possibility of describing by a continuous smooth function. At the same time,
the differential evolution equation is applicable both before and after the
bifurcation point. Key words: earthquake, main shock, evolution equation,

recently been applied successfully to various datasets. This progress is
largely fueled by slot-based methods, whose ability to cluster visual scenes
into meaningful objects holds great promise for compositional generalization
and downstream learning. In these methods, the number of slots (clusters) $K$
is typically chosen to match the number of ground-truth objects in the data,
even though this quantity is unknown in real-world settings. Indeed, the
sensitivity of slot-based methods to $K$, and how this affects their learned
correspondence to objects in the data has largely been ignored in the
literature. In this work, we address this issue through a systematic study of
slot-based methods. We propose using analogs to precision and recall based on
the Adjusted Rand Index to accurately quantify model behavior over a large
range of $K$. We find that, especially during training, incorrect choices of
$K$ do not yield the desired object decomposition and, in fact, cause
substantial oversegmentation or merging of separate objects
(undersegmentation). We demonstrate that the choice of the objective function
and incorporating instance-level annotations can moderately mitigate this
behavior while still falling short of fully resolving this issue. Indeed, we
show how this issue persists across multiple methods and datasets and stress
its importance for future slot-based models.

applications in animating virtual avatars. While most existing methods can
generate gestures from audio directly, they usually overlook that emotion is
one of the key factors of authentic co-speech gesture generation. In this work,
we propose EmotionGesture, a novel framework for synthesizing vivid and diverse
emotional co-speech 3D gestures from audio. Considering emotion is often
entangled with the rhythmic beat in speech audio, we first develop an
Emotion-Beat Mining module (EBM) to extract the emotion and audio beat features
as well as model their correlation via a transcript-based visual-rhythm
alignment. Then, we propose an initial pose based Spatial-Temporal Prompter
(STP) to generate future gestures from the given initial poses. STP effectively
models the spatial-temporal correlations between the initial poses and the
future gestures, thus producing the spatial-temporal coherent pose prompt. Once
we obtain pose prompts, emotion, and audio beat features, we will generate 3D
co-speech gestures through a transformer architecture. However, considering the
poses of existing datasets often contain jittering effects, this would lead to
generating unstable gestures. To address this issue, we propose an effective
objective function, dubbed Motion-Smooth Loss. Specifically, we model motion
offset to compensate for jittering ground-truth by forcing gestures to be
smooth. Last, we present an emotion-conditioned VAE to sample emotion features,
enabling us to generate diverse emotional results. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving
vivid and diverse emotional co-speech 3D gestures.

multilingual punctuation-agnostic sentence segmentation method, currently
covering 85 languages, trained in a self-supervised fashion on unsegmented

has a point: the use of a (powerful) sentence segmenter makes a considerable
difference for a downstream application such as machine translation (MT). By
using our method to match sentence segmentation to the segmentation used during
training of MT models, we achieve an average improvement of 2.3 BLEU points

that the solar electrical resistivity is small compared to the diffusive

anomalous resistivity models and their respective effects on simulations
related to magnetic reconnection in the Sun. We used the Bifrost code to
perform a 2D numerical reconnection experiment in the corona that is driven by
converging opposite polarities at the solar surface. This experiment was run
with three different commonly used resistivity models: 1) the hyper-diffusion
model originally implemented in Bifrost, 2) a resistivity proportional to the
current density, and 3) a resistivity proportional to the square of the
electron drift velocity. The study was complemented with a 1D experiment of a
Harris current sheet with the same resistivity models. The 2D experiment shows
that the three resistivity models are capable of producing results in
satisfactory agreement with each other in terms of the current sheet length,
inflow velocity, and Poynting influx. Even though Petschek-like reconnection
occurred with the current density-proportional resistivity while the other two
cases mainly followed plasmoid-mediated reconnection, the large-scale evolution
of thermodynamical quantities such as temperature and density are quite similar
between the three cases. For the 1D experiment, some recalibration of the
diffusion parameters is needed to obtain comparable results. Specifically the
hyper-diffusion and the drift velocity-dependent resistivity model needed only
minor adjustments, while the current density-proportional model needed a

consists in transferring and adapting the motion of a source character to
another target character. A typical application is the creation of motion
sequences from off-the-shelf motions by transferring them onto new characters.
Motion retargeting is also promising to increase interoperability of existing
animation systems and motion databases, as they often differ in the structure
of the skeleton(s) considered. Moreover, since the goal of motion retargeting
is to abstract and transfer motion dynamics, effective solutions might coincide
with expressive and powerful human motion models in which operations such as
cleaning or editing are easier. In this article, we present a novel abstract
representation of human motion agnostic to skeleton topology and morphology.
Based on transformers, our model is able to encode and decode motion sequences
with variable morphology and topology -- extending the scope of retargeting --
while supporting skeleton topologies not seen during the training phase. More
specifically, our model is structured as an autoencoder and encoding and
decoding are separately conditioned on skeleton templates to extract and
control morphology and topology. Beyond motion retargeting, our model has many
applications since our abstract representation is a convenient space to embed
motion data from different sources. It may potentially be benefical to a number
of data-driven methods, allowing them to combine scarce specialised motion
datasets (e.g. with style or contact annotations) and larger general motion
datasets for improved performance and generalisation ability. Moreover, we show
that our model can be useful for other applications beyond retargeting,

significant step in the direction of addressing this limitation. The idea is to
borrow one of the strengths of score-based DMs, which is the ability to perform
accurate density estimation in low-density regions and to address manifold
overfitting by means of data mollification. We connect data mollification
through the addition of Gaussian noise to Gaussian homotopy, which is a
well-known technique to improve optimization. Data mollification can be
implemented by adding one line of code in the optimization loop, and we
demonstrate that this provides a boost in generation quality of
likelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads. We report results on
image data sets with popular likelihood-based GMs, including variants of
variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, showing large improvements in

password hacks, leakages, and theft largely due to weak, reuse and poor
password habits of end-users, the call for passwordless authentication as
alternative intensifies. All the same, there are missing knowledge of whether
these password-based experiences are associated with societal economic status,
educational qualification of citizens, their age and gender, technological
advancements, and depth of penetration. In line with the above, understanding
the experience of end-users in developing economy to ascertain their
password-based experience has become of interest to the researchers. This paper
aims at measuring the experience of staff and students in University
communities within southeastern Nigeria on password-based authentication
systems. These communities have population whose age brackets are majorly
within the ages of 16 and 60 years; have people with requisite educational
qualifications ranging from Diploma to Doctorate degrees and constitutes good
number of ICT tools consumers. The survey had 291 respondents, and collected
data about age, educational qualifications, and gender from these respondents.
It also collected information about their password experience in social media
network, online shopping, electronic health care services, and internet
banking. Our analysis using SPSS and report by means of descriptive statistics,
frequency distribution, and Chi-Square tests showed that account compromise in
the geographical area is not common with the respondents reporting good
experience with passwords usage.

contribution is a novel training method for generative models, such as
Generative Adversarial Networks and Normalizing Flows, which explicitly
optimizes a user-defined trade-off between precision and recall. More
precisely, we show that achieving a specified precision-recall trade-off
corresponds to minimizing a unique $f$-divergence from a family we call the
\mbox{\em PR-divergences}. Conversely, any $f$-divergence can be written as a
linear combination of PR-divergences and corresponds to a weighted
precision-recall trade-off. Through comprehensive evaluations, we show that our

BigGAN in terms of either precision or recall when tested on datasets such as

processing systems from the perspective of information thermodynamics. We first
extend the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) to a subsystem.
Specifically, for a bipartite composite system consisting of a target system
and an auxiliary system, we show that the relative fluctuation of an arbitrary
current for the target system is lower bounded not only by the entropy
production associated with the target system but also by the information flow
between the two systems. As a direct consequence of this bipartite TUR, we
prove universal trade-off relations between the output power and efficiency of
an information-thermodynamic engine in the fast relaxation limit of the
auxiliary system. In this limit, we further show that the Gallavotti-Cohen

leads to universal relations between the fluctuations of information flow and
entropy production in the linear response regime. We illustrate these results
with simple examples: coupled quantum dots and coupled linear overdamped
Langevin equations. Interestingly, in the latter case, the equality of the
bipartite TUR is achieved even far from equilibrium, which is a very different

that CACAO provides no native modeling notation for graphically representing

$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{K}\right)$ rate as distributed gradient descent in
the smooth nonconvex regime, which improves the previous best
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{K}}\right)$ rate which was obtained under
significantly stronger assumptions. Our method converges significantly faster
in practice than competing methods.

fluid driven by an ensemble of internal gravity waves which approaches
statistical homogeneity and axi-symmetry. In a way similar to several recent
experimental works, non-linearities develop through the establishment of a set
of internal wave modes at discrete frequencies, when the forcing amplitude is
increased. We show that the most energetic of these modes are resonant
eigenmodes of the fluid domain. The discretization of the energy in frequency
and wavenumber associated to the emergence of these modes prevents the flow
from approaching a regime described by the Weak/Wave Turbulence Theory, in
which a forward cascade carried by a statistical ensemble of weakly non-linear
waves in an infinite domain forms an energy continuum in the frequency and
wavenumber spaces. We then show that the introduction of slightly tilted panels
at the top and at the bottom of the fluid domain allows to inhibit the
emergence of the discrete wave modes. In this new configuration, the non-linear
regime results in a continuum of energy over one decade of frequencies which is
mainly carried by internal gravity waves verifying the dispersion relation. We
therefore achieved a turbulent flow approaching a three-dimensional internal
wave turbulence regime with no discretization of the energy in the frequency
and wavenumber domains. These results constitute a significant step forward in
the search of the laboratory observation of a fully-developed weakly-non-linear
internal-gravity-wave turbulence.

services. A prominent example is school admissions. Existing research shows
that applicants ""play the system"" by submitting school rankings strategically.
We investigate whether applicants also play the system by manipulating their
eligibility at schools. We analyze this applicant deception in a theoretical
model and provide testable predictions for commonly-used admission procedures.
We confirm these model predictions empirically by analyzing the implementation
of two reforms. First, we find that the introduction of a residence-based
school-admission criterion in Denmark caused address changes to increase by
more than 100% before the high-school application deadline. This increase
occurred only in areas where the incentive to manipulate is high-powered.
Second, to assess whether this behavior reflects actual address changes, we
study a second reform that required applicants to provide additional proof of
place of residence to approve an address change. The second reform
significantly reduced address changes around the school application deadline,
suggesting that the observed increase in address changes mainly reflects
manipulation. The manipulation is driven by applicants from more affluent
households and their behavior affects non-manipulating applicants.
Counter-factual simulations show that among students not enrolling in their
first listed school, more than 25% would have been offered a place in the
absence of address manipulation and their peer GPA is 0.2SD lower due to the
manipulative behavior of other applicants. Our findings show that popular

core interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which leads to the study of
morphology-agnostic RL. However, existing benchmarks are highly restrictive in
the choice of starting point and target point, constraining the movement of the
agents within 2D space. In this work, we propose a novel setup for
morphology-agnostic RL, dubbed Subequivariant Graph RL in 3D environments
(3D-SGRL). Specifically, we first introduce a new set of more practical yet
challenging benchmarks in 3D space that allows the agent to have full
Degree-of-Freedoms to explore in arbitrary directions starting from arbitrary
configurations. Moreover, to optimize the policy over the enlarged state-action
space, we propose to inject geometric symmetry, i.e., subequivariance, into the
modeling of the policy and Q-function such that the policy can generalize to
all directions, improving exploration efficiency. This goal is achieved by a
novel SubEquivariant Transformer (SET) that permits expressive message
exchange. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method on the proposed benchmarks,

on single-task, multi-task, and zero-shot generalization scenarios. Extensive

non-Newtonian cerebral arterial circulation on electrical conductivity
distribution (ECD) in a realistic multi-compartment head model. It addresses
the importance and challenges associated with electrophysiological modalities,
such as transcranial electrical stimulation, electro-magnetoencephalography,
and electrical impedance tomography. Factors such as electrical conductivity's
impact on forward modeling accuracy, complex vessel networks, data acquisition
limitations (especially in MRI), and blood flow phenomena are considered.
Methods: The Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) govern the non-Newtonian flow model
used in this study. The solver comprises two stages: the first solves the
pressure field using a dynamical pressure-Poisson equation derived from NSEs,
and the second updates the velocity field using Leray regularization and the
pressure distribution from the first stage. The Carreau-Yasuda model
establishes the connection between blood velocity and viscosity. Blood
concentration in microvessels is approximated using Fick's law of diffusion,
and conductivity mapping is obtained via Archie's law. The head model used
corresponds to an open 7 Tesla MRI dataset, differentiating arterial vessels
from other structures. Results: The results suggest the establishment of a
dynamic model of cerebral blood flow for arterial and microcirculation. Blood
pressure and conductivity distributions are obtained through numerically
simulated pulse sequences, enabling approximation of blood concentration and
conductivity within the brain. Conclusions: This model provides an
approximation of dynamic blood flow and corresponding ECD in different brain
regions. The advantage lies in its applicability with limited a priori
information about blood flow and compatibility with arbitrary head models that
distinguish arteries.

individually or by classifying shapes into predefined archaeological types and
analyzing the associated distinguishing characteristics. Recently, series of
high-resolution digital representations of artifacts have become available, and
we explore their potential on a set of 3D models of ancient Greek and Roman
sundials, with the aim of providing alternatives to the traditional
archaeological method of ``trend extraction by ordination'' (typology). In the
proposed approach, each 3D shape is represented as a point in a shape space --
a high-dimensional, curved, non-Euclidean space. By performing regression in
shape space, we find that for Roman sundials, the bend of the sundials'
shadow-receiving surface changes with the location's latitude. This suggests
that, apart from the inscribed hour lines, also a sundial's shape was adjusted
to the place of installation. As an example of more advanced inference, we use
the identified trend to infer the latitude at which a sundial, whose
installation location is unknown, was placed. We also derive a novel method for
differentiated morphological trend assertion, building upon and extending the
theory of geometric statistics and shape analysis. Specifically, we present a
regression-based method for statistical normalization of shapes that serves as
a means of disentangling parameter-dependent effects (trends) and unexplained

study various concepts in the physics literature. First we apply both the
Kerr-Schild and the Weyl double copy to solution generating transformations in
General Relativity, where we identify Ehlers transformation as the double copy
of electromagnetic duality transformation. Secondly, as a spin-off of the Weyl
double copy, we use gauge fields defined on curved spacetimes to construct the
Weyl tensor and study a host of solution of Einstein's equations. This study
provides a test of the non-triviality of the double copy formalism.
  The second half of the thesis deals with mathematical concepts of physical
relevance. First we apply the Kerr-Schild double copy to the concept of
holonomy groups of Riemannian manifolds. We find that the single copy of the
Riemannian holonomy operator, which we dub SCH, to be a similar operator

study of this single copy operator on different solutions of Einstein equations
and their respective single copies, where we find that the holonomy and SCH
groups differ for the Taub-NUT metric, while both reducing to $\text{SU}(2)$

Ricci flow equation, interpreted as the beta function of the closed string, and
obtain the Yang-Mills flow equation, which is physically interpreted as the
beta function of the open string coupled to a gauge field.

the performances of the empirical risk minimisation (ERM) using

generalisation error to similar datasets with outliers, and the estimation
error of the original, unpolluted function. Our results are compared with the
information theoretic Bayes-optimal estimation bound. For the generalization
error, we find that optimally-regularised ERM is asymptotically consistent in
the large sample complexity limit if one perform a simple calibration, and
compute the rates of convergence. For the estimation error however, we show
that due to a norm calibration mismatch, the consistency of the estimator
requires an oracle estimate of the optimal norm, or the presence of a
cross-validation set not corrupted by the outliers. We examine in detail how
performance depends on the loss function and on the degree of outlier
corruption in the training set and identify a region of parameters where the
optimal performance of the Huber loss is identical to that of the $\ell_2$
loss, offering insights into the use cases of different loss functions.

categorised the CMEs based on their linear speed and angular width, and studied
the distribution of type II bursts with `fast' ($speed ~\geq 500 km/s$), `slow'
($speed ~< 500 km/s$), `wide' ($width ~\geq 60^o$) and `narrow' ($width ~<

  Vision Language Models",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large pre-trained vision-language models have shown great prominence in
transferring pre-acquired knowledge to various domains and downstream tasks
with appropriate prompting or tuning. Existing prevalent tuning methods can be
generally categorized into three genres: 1) prompt engineering by creating
suitable prompt texts, which is time-consuming and requires domain expertise;
2) or simply fine-tuning the whole model, which is extremely inefficient; 3)
prompt tuning through parameterized prompt embeddings with the text encoder.
Nevertheless, all methods rely on the text encoder for bridging the modality
gap between vision and language. In this work, we question the necessity of the
cumbersome text encoder for a more lightweight and efficient tuning paradigm as
well as more representative prompt embeddings closer to the image
representations. To achieve this, we propose a Concept Embedding Search (ConES)
approach by optimizing prompt embeddings -- without the need of the text
encoder -- to capture the 'concept' of the image modality through a variety of
task objectives. By dropping the text encoder, we are able to significantly
speed up the learning process, \eg, from about an hour to just ten minutes in
our experiments for personalized text-to-image generation without impairing the
generation quality. Moreover, our proposed approach is orthogonal to current
existing tuning methods since the searched concept embeddings can be further
utilized in the next stage of fine-tuning the pre-trained large models for
boosting performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach can beat the
prompt tuning and textual inversion methods in a variety of downstream tasks
including objection detection, instance segmentation, and image generation. Our
approach also shows better generalization capability for unseen concepts in
specialized domains, such as the medical domain.

reflecting surface (IRS) to combat channel fading without any channel state
information (CSI), namely blind beamforming. Differing from most previous works
based on a two-stage paradigm of first estimating channels and then optimizing
phase shifts, our approach is completely data-driven, only requiring a dataset
of the received signal power at the user terminal. Thus, our method does not
incur extra overhead costs for channel estimation, and does not entail
collaboration from service provider, either. The main idea is to choose phase
shifts at random and use the corresponding conditional sample mean of the
received signal power to extract the main features of the wireless environment.
This blind beamforming approach guarantees an $N^2$ boost of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), where $N$ is the number of reflective elements (REs) of IRS,
regardless of whether the direct channel is line-of-sight (LoS) or not.
Moreover, blind beamforming is extended to a double-IRS system with provable
performance. Finally, prototype tests show that the proposed blind beamforming
method can be readily incorporated into the existing communication systems in
the real world; simulation tests further show that it works for a variety of
fading channel models.

Letter, this problem is addressed by extending the resource theory of
entanglement for multipartite systems beyond the standard framework of local

transformations capable of introducing a small, controllable increase of

arbitrarily small. We demonstrate that in this adjusted framework, the
transformation rates between multipartite states are fundamentally dictated by
the bipartite entanglement entropies of the respective quantum states.
Remarkably, this approach allows the reduction of tripartite entanglement to
its bipartite analog, indicating that every pure tripartite state can be
reversibly synthesized from a suitable number of singlets distributed between

Combining the structure of model driven and data driven deep learning
approaches, a hybrid driven learning architecture is devised for joint

used to jointly learn spatial and frequency features. Furthermore, we design a
flexible hybrid driven network in a hybrid passive and active IRS aided system.
Specifically, the depthwise separable convolution is applied to the data driven
network, leading to less network complexity and fewer parameters at the IRS
side. Numerical results indicate that in both systems, the proposed hybrid

equations Ax = b. These enlarged CG methods consist of enlarging the Krylov
subspace by a maximum of t vectors per iteration based on the domain
decomposition of the graph of A. As for the s-step versions, s iterations of
the enlarged Conjugate Gradient methods are merged in one iteration. The
Enlarged CG methods and their s-step versions converge in less iterations than
the classical CG, but at the expense of requiring more memory storage than CG.
Thus in this paper we explore different options for reducing the memory

$c:A\to R$, describes a road network in which an electric car can roam. An arc
$uv$ models a road segment connecting the two vertices $u$ and $v$. The cost
$c(uv)$ of an arc $uv$ is the amount of energy the car needs to traverse the
arc. This amount may be positive, zero or negative. To make the problem
realistic, we assume there are no negative cycles.
  The car has a battery that can store up to $B$ units of energy. It can
traverse an arc $uv\in A$ only if it is at $u$ and the charge $b$ in its
battery satisfies $b\ge c(uv)$. If it traverses the arc, it reaches $v$ with a
charge of $\min(b-c(uv),B)$. Arcs with positive costs deplete the battery, arcs
with negative costs charge the battery, but not above its capacity of $B$.
  Given $s,t\in V$, can the car travel from $s$ to $t$, starting at $s$ with an
initial charge $b$, where $0\le b\le B$? If so, what is the maximum charge with
which the car can reach $t$? Equivalently, what is the smallest
$\delta_{B,b}(s,t)$ such that the car can reach $t$ with a charge of
$b-\delta_{B,b}(s,t)$, and which path should the car follow to achieve this? We
refer to $\delta_{B,b}(s,t)$ as the energetic cost of traveling from $s$ to
$t$. We let $\delta_{B,b}(s,t)=\infty$ if the car cannot travel from $s$ to $t$
starting with an initial charge of $b$. The problem of computing energetic
costs is a strict generalization of the standard shortest paths problem.
  We show that the single-source minimum energetic paths problem can be solved
using simple, but subtle, adaptations of the Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra
algorithms. To make Dijkstra's algorithm work in the presence of negative arcs,
but no negative cycles, we use a variant of the $A^*$ search heuristic. These
results are explicit or implicit in some previous papers. We provide a simpler
and unified description of these algorithms.

relatedness increases in an intermediate range. Second, full cooperation is
impossible to sustain for a medium-high range of relatedness values. Moreover,

application areas. The solution of this problem requires finding the smallest
singular value and corresponding right singular vector of $[A,b]$, which is
challenging when $A$ is large and sparse. An efficient algorithm for this case
due to Bj\""{o}rck et al., called RQI-PCGTLS, is based on Rayleigh quotient
iteration coupled with the conjugate gradient method preconditioned via
Cholesky factors.
  We develop a mixed precision variant of this algorithm, called RQI-PCGTLS-MP,
in which up to three different precisions can be used. We assume that the
lowest precision is used in the computation of the preconditioner, and give
theoretical constraints on how this precision must be chosen to ensure
stability. In contrast to the standard least squares case, for total least
squares problems, the constraint on this precision depends not only on the
matrix $A$, but also on the right-hand side $b$. We perform a number of
numerical experiments on model total least squares problems used in the
literature, which demonstrate that our algorithm can attain the same accuracy
as RQI-PCGTLS albeit with a potential convergence delay due to the use of low
precision. Performance modeling shows that the mixed precision approach can
achieve up to a $4\times$ speedup depending on the size of the matrix and the

phenomena, including the possession of three distinct superconducting phases at
ambient pressure for magnetic field $\mu_0 H \leq$ 40 T aligned in certain
orientations. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on
UTe$_2$ specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts
to understand the microscopic properties of this material. Here, we report high
magnetic field measurements on a new generation of ultraclean UTe$_2$
specimens, which possess enhanced superconducting critical temperatures and
fields compared to previous sample generations. Remarkably, for $H$ applied
close to the hard magnetic $b$ direction, we find that the angular extent of
magnetic field-reinforced superconductivity is significantly increased in these
high purity crystals. This suggests that, in proximity to a field-induced
metamagnetic transition, the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations - that are
strongly suppressed by disorder - is likely responsible for tuning UTe$_2$
between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases. Our results reveal a
strong sensitivity to crystalline disorder of the field-reinforced
superconducting state of UTe$_2$.

2022 came another paradigm shift, the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) scheme.
PBS was introduced to decouple the roles of selecting and ordering transactions
in a block (i.e., the builder), from those validating its contents and
proposing the block to the network as the new head of the blockchain (i.e., the
proposer). In this landscape, proposers are the validators in the
Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol who validate and secure the network, while
now relying on specialized block builders for creating blocks with the most
value (e.g., transaction fees) for the proposer. Additionally, relays play a
crucial new role in this ecosystem, acting as mediators between builders and
proposers, being entrusted with the responsibility of transmitting the most
lucrative blocks from the builders to the proposers.
  PBS is currently an opt-in protocol (i.e., a proposer can still opt-out and
build their own blocks). In this work, we study it's adoption and show that the
current PBS landscape exhibits significant centralization amongst the builders
and relays. We further explore whether PBS effectively achieves its intended
objectives of enabling hobbyist validators to maximize block profitability and
preventing censorship. Our findings reveal that although PBS grants all
validators the same opportunity to access optimized and competitive blocks, it
tends to stimulate censorship rather than reduce it. Additionally, our analysis
demonstrates that relays do not consistently uphold their commitments and may
prove unreliable. Specifically, there are instances where proposers do not
receive the complete value as initially promised, and the censorship or
filtering capabilities pledged by the relay exhibit significant gaps.

flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes of B meson decays have faded
away. However, does this mean that all new physics possibilities related to
$b\to s\ell^+\ell^-$ have been excluded? We aim to answer this question in this
work. The state-of-the-art effective Hamiltonian is adopted to describe $b \to
s$ transition, while BSM (beyond the Standard Model) new physics effects are
encoded in Wilson coefficients (WCs). Using around 200 observables in leptonic
and semileptonic decays of B mesons and bottom baryons, measured by LHCb, CMS,
ATLAS, Belle, and BaBar, we perform global fits of these Wilson coefficients in
four different scenarios. In particular, lepton flavors in WCs are specified in
some of the working scenarios. To see the change of new physics parameters, we
use both the data before and after the 2022 release of $R_{K^{(*)}}$ in two
separate sets of fits. We find that in all four scenarios, $\Delta C_9^\mu$
still has a deviation more than $4\sigma$ from the Standard Model. At the
$1\sigma$ level, the lepton flavor in WCs is distinguishable for $\Delta C_{9,
S, P}$ but indistinguishable for $\Delta C_{10}$. We demonstrate numerically
that there is no chirality for muon type of scalar operator and it is kept at
the $1\sigma$ level for their electron type dual ones, while chiral difference

this paper, we propose NicePIM to efficiently explore the design space of
hardware architecture and DNN mapping of DRAM-PIM accelerators, which consists
of three key components: PIM-Tuner, PIM-Mapper and Data-Scheduler. PIM-Tuner
optimizes the hardware configurations leveraging a DNN model for classifying
area-compliant architectures and a deep kernel learning model for identifying
better hardware parameters. PIM-Mapper explores a variety of DNN mapping
configurations, including parallelism between branches of DNN, DNN layer
partitioning, DRAM capacity allocation and data layout pattern in DRAM to
generate high-hardware-utilization DNN mapping schemes for various hardware
configurations. The Data-Scheduler employs an integer-linear-programming-based
data scheduling algorithm to alleviate the inter-PIM-node communication
overhead of data-sharing brought by DNN layer partitioning. Experimental
results demonstrate that NicePIM can optimize hardware configurations for
DRAM-PIM systems effectively and can generate high-quality DNN mapping schemes

guide the segmentation branch to learn from richer high-resolution features, we
propose a feature affinity module and a scale affinity module to enhance the

strategy in providing accurate predictions even for cosmologies and

achieved? In this regard, we propose a multi-source adversarial transfer
learning method based on local feature similarity to the source domain to
handle transfer scenarios where the source and target domains have only local
similarities. This method extracts transferable local features between a single
source domain and the target domain through a sub-network. Specifically, the
feature extractor of the sub-network is induced by the domain discriminator to
learn transferable knowledge between the source domain and the target domain.
The extracted features are then weighted by an attention module to suppress
non-transferable local features while enhancing transferable local features. In
order to ensure that the data from the target domain in different sub-networks

EVentuality-centric KG (EVKG) can naturally provide references to such kind of
intuitive and logical inference. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new
framework to leverage neural methods to answer complex logical queries based on
an EVKG, which can satisfy not only traditional first-order logic constraints

to be the cause of ``Food is bad'' due to implicit temporal constraint. To
facilitate consistent reasoning on EVKGs, we propose Complex Eventuality Query

logical constraints governing the temporal order and occurrence of
eventualities. In this manner, we propose to leverage theorem provers for

labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no
datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the
possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural
images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant
features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration
between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of
public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source
domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,
and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,
which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial
transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.
Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial
transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a

utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a
single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse

small-scale vanadium redox flow batteries. These systems use two redox pairs
dissolved in separate electrolytes to convert electrical energy into chemical
energy, a process that can be reversed in an efficient way to restore the
initial electrical energy with negligible chemical losses. After flowing
through the electrochemical cell, the electrolytes are stored in separate
tanks, where they discharge as submerged jets with small temperature and
composition changes compared to the electrolyte already present in the tanks.
The subsequent mixing process is critical for battery performance, as imperfect
mixing tends to reduce the energy capacity and may lead to asymmetric battery
operation. The analysis starts using order-of-magnitude estimates to determine
the conditions under which the mixing process is dominated by momentum or
buoyancy. Transient two-dimensional simulations illustrate the different flow
regimes that emerge in the tanks under laminar flow conditions. The results
show that, contrary to the common assumption, the electrolytes do not mix well
in the tanks. In the presence of high-momentum -- and, specially, positively
buoyant -- jets, a significant fraction of the electrolyte remains unmixed and
unreacted for long periods, thus reducing the energy capacity. The results also
show that the availability of reliable electrolyte properties is crucial for
the accuracy of the numerical simulations, as, under the mixed convection
conditions that typically prevail in vanadium redox flow batteries, small
density variations can significantly impact the long-term mixing of the
electrolytes. In particular, in momentum-dominated flows the cumulative effect
of density changes over time eventually leads to flow instabilities that
significantly promote mixing; therefore, they should be taken into account in
future studies.

update to the classifier and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number
of examples in memory and so a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples
to store, choosing the subset that minimises the KL divergence between the true

performance of DeepCCG on a range of settings, including those with overlapping

  Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning in SDN",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The optimal multicast tree problem in the Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
multicast routing is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Although
existing SDN intelligent solution methods, which are based on deep
reinforcement learning, can dynamically adapt to complex network link state
changes, these methods are plagued by problems such as redundant branches,
large action space, and slow agent convergence. In this paper, an SDN
intelligent multicast routing algorithm based on deep hierarchical
reinforcement learning is proposed to circumvent the aforementioned problems.
First, the multicast tree construction problem is decomposed into two
sub-problems: the fork node selection problem and the construction of the
optimal path from the fork node to the destination node. Second, based on the
information characteristics of SDN global network perception, the multicast
tree state matrix, link bandwidth matrix, link delay matrix, link packet loss
rate matrix, and sub-goal matrix are designed as the state space of intrinsic
and meta controllers. Then, in order to mitigate the excessive action space,
our approach constructs different action spaces at the upper and lower levels.
The meta-controller generates an action space using network nodes to select the
fork node, and the intrinsic controller uses the adjacent edges of the current
node as its action space, thus implementing four different action selection
strategies in the construction of the multicast tree. To facilitate the
intelligent agent in constructing the optimal multicast tree with greater
speed, we developed alternative reward strategies that distinguish between
single-step node actions and multi-step actions towards multiple destination
nodes.

direct collapse and boosted accretion. Turbulence associated with gravitational
infall and star formation can drive the rms field strength toward equipartition
with the mean gas kinetic energy; this field has a generic tendency to
self-organize into large, coherent structures. If the poloidal component of the
field (relative to the rotational axis of a star-forming disc) becomes
organized on scales $\lesssim r$ and attains an energy of order a few percent
of the turbulent energy in the disc, then dynamo effects are expected to
generate magnetic torques capable of boosting the inflow speed and thickening
the disk. The accretion flow can transport matter toward the center of mass at
a rate adequate to create and grow a massive direct-collapse black hole (DCBH)
seed and fuel the subsequent AGN at a high rate, without becoming

such attacks by modifying the weights of the graph that users observe. The
defender must balance inhibiting the attacker against any negative effects of
the defense on benign users. Specifically, the defender's goals are: (a) to
recommend the shortest paths possible to users, (b) for the lengths of the
shortest paths in the published graph to be close to those of the same paths in
the true graph, and (c) to minimize the probability of an attack. We formulate
the defense as a Stackelberg game in which the defender is the leader and the
attacker is the follower. In this context, we also consider a zero-sum version
of the game, in which the defender's goal is to minimize cost while achieving
the minimum possible attack probability. We show that this problem is NP-hard

  ordinal labels",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many variables of interest in clinical medicine, like disease severity, are
recorded using discrete ordinal categories such as normal/mild/moderate/severe.
These labels are used to train and evaluate disease severity prediction models.
However, ordinal categories represent a simplification of an underlying
continuous severity spectrum. Using continuous scores instead of ordinal
categories is more sensitive to detecting small changes in disease severity
over time. Here, we present a generalized framework that accurately predicts
continuously valued variables using only discrete ordinal labels during model
development. We found that for three clinical prediction tasks, models that
take the ordinal relationship of the training labels into account outperformed
conventional multi-class classification models. Particularly the continuous
scores generated by ordinal classification and regression models showed a
significantly higher correlation with expert rankings of disease severity and
lower mean squared errors compared to the multi-class classification models.
Furthermore, the use of MC dropout significantly improved the ability of all
evaluated deep learning approaches to predict continuously valued scores that
truthfully reflect the underlying continuous target variable. We showed that
accurate continuously valued predictions can be generated even if the model
development only involves discrete ordinal labels. The novel framework has been
validated on three different clinical prediction tasks and has proven to bridge
the gap between discrete ordinal labels and the underlying continuously valued
variables.

Previous approximations oversimplified the thermodynamic nature of the

their input-gradients are often aligned with human perception, referred to in
the literature as perceptually-aligned gradients (PAGs). Despite only being
trained for classification, PAGs cause robust models to have rudimentary
generative capabilities, including image generation, denoising, and
in-painting. However, the underlying mechanisms behind these phenomena remain
unknown. In this work, we provide a first explanation of PAGs via
\emph{off-manifold robustness}, which states that models must be more robust
off- the data manifold than they are on-manifold. We first demonstrate
theoretically that off-manifold robustness leads input gradients to lie
approximately on the data manifold, explaining their perceptual alignment. We
then show that Bayes optimal models satisfy off-manifold robustness, and
confirm the same empirically for robust models trained via gradient norm
regularization, noise augmentation, and randomized smoothing. Quantifying the
perceptual alignment of model gradients via their similarity with the gradients
of generative models, we show that off-manifold robustness correlates well with
perceptual alignment. Finally, based on the levels of on- and off-manifold
robustness, we identify three different regimes of robustness that affect both
perceptual alignment and model accuracy: weak robustness, bayes-aligned
robustness, and excessive robustness.

sun. However, to harness this energy, organisms must transform matter from one
chemical (redox) state to another. For example, photosynthetic organisms can
capture light energy by carrying out a pair of electron donor and acceptor
transformations (e.g., water to oxygen, CO$_2$ to organic carbon). Closure of
ecosystems to matter requires that all such transformations are ultimately
balanced, i.e., other organisms must carry out corresponding reverse
transformations, resulting in cycles that are coupled to each other. A
sustainable closed ecosystem thus requires self-organized cycles of matter, in
which every transformation has sufficient thermodynamic favorability to
maintain an adequate number of organisms carrying out that process. Here, we
propose a new conceptual model that explains the self-organization and emergent
features of closed ecosystems. We study this model with varying levels of
metabolic diversity and energy input, finding that several thermodynamic
features converge across ecosystems. Specifically, irrespective of their
species composition, large and metabolically diverse communities self-organize
to extract roughly 10% of the maximum extractable energy, or 100 fold more than
randomized communities. Moreover, distinct communities implement energy
extraction in convergent ways, as indicated by strongly correlated fluxes
through nutrient cycles. As the driving force from light increases, however,
these features -- fluxes and total energy extraction -- become more variable
across communities, indicating that energy limitation imposes tight
thermodynamic constraints on collective metabolism.

haptic, etc.). The results show that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were strongly
correlated with humans in some abstract dimensions, such as emotion and
salience. In dimensions related to sensory and motor domains, GPT-3.5 shows
weaker correlations while GPT-4 has made significant progress compared to
GPT-3.5. Still, GPT-4 struggles to fully capture motor aspects of conceptual

standard and reversible pebbling space are PSPACE-hard to approximate to within
any additive constant. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first
hardness of approximation results for pebble games in an unrestricted setting

pebbling is equivalent to the games in [Dymond and Tompa '85] and [Raz and

Jordan frames allows for an expansion-collapse duality -- an always expanding
Einstein frame universe can have a dual Jordan frame description that is
contracting forever. The scenario eventually runs into an apparent paradox.
When a collapsing universe approaches singularity, the classical description of
the spacetime becomes inadequate. The contracting Jordan frame universe is
expected to develop quantum characteristics when its scale factor becomes
sufficiently small. However, at the same time, the corresponding Einstein frame
universe is expected to behave classically, due to the arbitrarily large size
it has grown to. In this case, the conformal map appears to be providing a
duality between a quantum effect-dominated universe and a universe behaving
classically. We investigate the status of the conformal map at the quantum
level in such a scenario, focusing on addressing this paradox. The Einstein and
Jordan frame universes are quantized individually using the Wheeler-DeWitt
prescription. We show that the classical conformal map holds true at the
quantum level when compared through the expectation values of the scale factor
operators in the two frames. The relative quantum fluctuation in the scale
factor is found to be conformally invariant, and it increases in both the past
and future directions according to the internal clock. Expectedly, the quantum
fluctuations in the collapsing Jordan frame keep on increasing as it shrinks
towards singularity. More surprisingly, the quantum fluctuations in the
expanding Einstein frame keep on increasing as well, even as its classical
scale factor becomes larger. Despite having drastically different cosmological
evolutions, the rise in quantum characteristics in a collapsing frame implies
the same in its expanding counterpart, thereby resolving the apparent paradox.

instability, (3) the curvature perturbation amplitude as well as its tilt and
the tensor-to-scalar ratio turn out to be simultaneously compatible with the
recent Planck data for suitable values of the parameters. After the inflation
ends, the scalar field starts to decay to radiation with a constant decay
width. For our considered scalar potential and the GB coupling function, the
model results to an analytic power law solution of the Hubble parameter and a
logarithmic solution of the scalar field during the reheating era, where the
exponent of the Hubble parameter determines the effective EoS parameter
($w_\mathrm{eff}$) during the same. The stability of such reheating dynamics is
examined by dynamical analysis which ensures that $w_\mathrm{eff}$ can go
beyond unity and reach up-to the maximum value of $\mathrm{max}(w_\mathrm{eff})

consequences on enhancing the primordial gravitational waves' amplitude

input of the reheating stage. We finally construct the complete forms of scalar

transits from inflation to reheating, and numerically solve the Hubble

trajectory tracking. The presented method features a high-gain disturbance
observer (HGDO) that provides disturbance estimates in real-time. The estimates
are then used in a trajectory control law to compensate for disturbance
effects. We present theoretical convergence results showing that the proposed
HGDO can quickly converge to an adjustable neighborhood of actual disturbance
values. We will then integrate the disturbance estimates with a typical robust
trajectory controller, namely sliding mode control (SMC), and present Lyapunov
stability analysis to establish the boundedness of trajectory tracking errors.
However, our stability analysis can be easily extended to other Lyapunov-based
controllers to develop different HGDO-based controllers with formal stability
guarantees. We evaluate the proposed HGDO-based control method using both
simulation and laboratory experiments in various scenarios and in the presence
of external disturbances. Our results indicate that the addition of HGDO to a
quadrotor trajectory controller can significantly improve the accuracy and
precision of trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances.

  Multi-Agent Debate","Work in progress",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown remarkable
performance on general language tasks but still struggle on complex reasoning
tasks, which drives the research on cognitive behaviors of LLMs to explore
human-like problem-solving strategies. Along this direction, one representative
strategy is self-reflection, which asks an LLM to refine the solution with the
feedback generated by itself iteratively. However, our study shows that such
reflection-style methods suffer from the Degeneration-of-Thought (DoT) problem:
once the LLM has established confidence in its solutions, it is unable to
generate novel thoughts later through reflection even if its initial stance is
incorrect. To address the DoT problem, we propose a Multi-Agent Debate (MAD)
framework, in which multiple agents express their arguments in the state of
""tit for tat"" and a judge manages the debate process to obtain a final
solution. Clearly, our MAD framework encourages divergent thinking in LLMs
which would be helpful for tasks that require deep levels of contemplation.
Experiment results on two challenging datasets, commonsense machine translation
and counter-intuitive arithmetic reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our MAD framework. Extensive analyses suggest that the adaptive break of debate
and the modest level of ""tit for tat"" state are required for MAD to obtain good
performance. Moreover, we find that LLMs might not be a fair judge if different
LLMs are used for agents. Codes:

the state of a subset of qubits (ancillae) within a processor without revealing
or disturbing the state of the remaining qubits. Among neutral-atom based
platforms, a scalable, high-fidelity approach to mid-circuit measurement that
retains the ancilla qubits in a state suitable for future operations has not
yet been demonstrated. In this work, we perform imaging using a
narrow-linewidth transition in an array of tweezer-confined $^{171}$Yb atoms to
demonstrate nondestructive state-selective and site-selective detection. By
applying site-specific light shifts, selected atoms within the array can be
hidden from imaging light, which allows a subset of qubits to be measured while
causing only percent-level errors on the remaining qubits. As a
proof-of-principle demonstration of conditional operations based on the results
of the mid-circuit measurements, and of our ability to reuse ancilla qubits, we
perform conditional refilling of ancilla sites to correct for occasional atom
loss, while maintaining the coherence of data qubits. Looking towards true
continuous operation, we demonstrate loading of a magneto-optical trap with a
minimal degree of qubit decoherence.

proposed, which enables the inference of the underlying correlation structure

controlled at a pre-defined threshold on two levels simultaneously. The
deployed test statistics originate in the sample coherence matrix. The required
probability models are learned from the data using the bootstrap. Local false
discovery rates are used to solve the multiple hypothesis testing problem.
Compared to the existing techniques in the literature, the developed technique
does not assume an a priori correlation structure and work well when the number
of data sets is large while the number of observations is small. In addition,
it can handle the presence of distributional uncertainties, heavy-tailed noise,

Doppler across different multipath arrivals. By approximating the non-linear
time distortion as a piece-wise-linear Markov model, we formulate the problem
in a dynamic programming framework known as segmented least-squares (SLS). In
order to circumvent an ill-conditioned formulation, perturbations are added to
the Doppler model during the linearization process. The successful operation of
the algorithm is demonstrated in a simulation on a synthetic channel with
time-varying non-uniform Doppler.

demonstrated the production of thin diamond membranes by neon implantation of

better describes ion implantation, allowing us to estimate the diamond critical

through time. Another related question is whether and how lexical relations
over pairs of words, such as synonymy, change over time. There are currently
two competing, apparently opposite hypotheses in the historical linguistic
literature regarding how synonymous words evolve: the Law of Differentiation
(LD) argues that synonyms tend to take on different meanings over time, whereas
the Law of Parallel Change (LPC) claims that synonyms tend to undergo the same
semantic change and therefore remain synonyms. So far, there has been little
research using distributional models to assess to what extent these laws apply
on historical corpora. In this work, we take a first step toward detecting
whether LD or LPC operates for given word pairs. After recasting the problem
into a more tractable task, we combine two linguistic resources to propose the
first complete evaluation framework on this problem and provide empirical
evidence in favor of a dominance of LD. We then propose various computational
approaches to the problem using Distributional Semantic Models and grounded in
recent literature on Lexical Semantic Change detection. Our best approaches
achieve a balanced accuracy above 0.6 on our dataset. We discuss challenges
still faced by these approaches, such as polysemy or the potential confusion

disjoint local minima, associated with an approximate discrete symmetry of a
dominant flexion term. Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms that are not

abundance fluctuations over metagenomic samples are found to be correlated, but
reproducing these through appropriate models remains still an open task. The
present paper tackles this problem and points to species interactions as a
necessary mechanism to account for them. Specifically, we discuss several
possibilities to include interactions in population models and recognize
Lotka-Volterra constants as successful ansatz. We design a Bayesian inference
algorithm to obtain sets of interaction constants able to reproduce the
experimental correlation distributions much better than the state-of-the-art
attempts. Importantly, the model still reproduces single-species, experimental,
macroecological patterns previously detected in the literature, concerning the
abundance fluctuations across both species and communities. Endorsed by the
agreement with the observed phenomenology, our analysis provides insights on
the properties of microbial interactions, and suggests their sparsity as a
necessary feature to balance the emergence of different patterns.

Averaging Allocation (SMAA) approach based on the equilibrium. We theoretically
demonstrate that SMAA could achieve a good regret guarantee for each player

incurring substantial losses for themselves. We finally validate the
effectiveness of the method in extensive synthetic experiments.

Although model-based approaches are more data efficient and have performance

these variations against random forests, a traditional regression method that
predates GCNNs by over 15 years. We evaluated these methods using simulated

although random forest regression is a less compact model, it matches or
exceeds the performance of all variations of GCNNs in our experiments. This
suggests that the current graph convolutional methods may not be the best

Finally, our findings also suggest that for future research on GCNN for traffic

subjected to both a mean squared-error (MSE) distortion loss as well as a
perception loss to target realism. Motivated by prior approaches, we consider
two different perception loss functions (PLFs). The first, PLF-JD, considers
the joint distribution (JD) of all the video frames up to the current one,
while the second metric, PLF-FMD, considers the framewise marginal
distributions (FMD) between the source and reconstruction. Using information
theoretic analysis and deep-learning based experiments, we demonstrate that the
choice of PLF can have a significant effect on the reconstruction, especially
at low-bit rates. In particular, while the reconstruction based on PLF-JD can
better preserve the temporal correlation across frames, it also imposes a
significant penalty in distortion compared to PLF-FMD and further makes it more
difficult to recover from errors made in the earlier output frames. Although
the choice of PLF decisively affects reconstruction quality, we also
demonstrate that it may not be essential to commit to a particular PLF during
encoding and the choice of PLF can be delegated to the decoder. In particular,
encoded representations generated by training a system to minimize the MSE
(without requiring either PLF) can be {\em near universal} and can generate
close to optimal reconstructions for either choice of PLF at the decoder. We
validate our results using (one-shot) information-theoretic analysis, detailed

including chemical and materials modeling which we focus on in this paper.
These constraints include smoothness, and symmetry with respect to
translations, rotations, and permutations of identical particles. Most existing
architectures in other domains do not fulfill simultaneously all of these
requirements and thus are not applicable to atomic-scale simulations. Many of
them, however, can be straightforwardly made to incorporate all the physical
constraints except for rotational symmetry. We propose a general symmetrization
protocol that adds rotational equivariance to any given model while preserving
all the other constraints. As a demonstration of the potential of this idea, we

MAGNet, a graph-based model that generates abstract shapes before allocating

used for defining nonassociative versions of Grigori Perelman F- and

We develop and apply the anholonomic frame and connection deformation method,
AFCDM, which allows us to construct exact and parametric solutions describing
nonassociative geometric flow evolution scenarios and modified Ricci soliton
configurations with quasi-stationary generic off-diagonal metrics. There are
provided explicit examples of solutions modelling geometric and statistical

off-diagonal geometric flow extensions of the swampland program, related
conjectures and claims on geometric and physical properties of new classes of

the convergence of candidates for users and the lack of system-level diversity.
Meanwhile, in the reranking phase, Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is
deployed to increase individual-level diverisity. Heavily relying on the
semantic information of items, DPP suffers from clickbait and inaccurate

consequently gain more graph explorations to improve the system-level

(2D-CNN). Experimental results on a public data platform of a bearing and our
laboratory platform of robot grinding show that this method is better than the
existing methods under different noise intensities.

  Human Activity Recognition",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recognizing human activities from sensor data is a vital task in various
domains, but obtaining diverse and labeled sensor data remains challenging and
costly. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised statistical feature-guided
diffusion model for sensor-based human activity recognition. The proposed
method aims to generate synthetic time-series sensor data without relying on
labeled data, addressing the scarcity and annotation difficulties associated
with real-world sensor data. By conditioning the diffusion model on statistical
information such as mean, standard deviation, Z-score, and skewness, we
generate diverse and representative synthetic sensor data. We conducted
experiments on public human activity recognition datasets and compared the
proposed method to conventional oversampling methods and state-of-the-art
generative adversarial network methods. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method can improve the performance of human activity
recognition and outperform existing techniques.

of acute stroke. Using machine learning techniques, our research has succeeded
in developing accurate diagnosis and prediction real-time models from
hemodynamic data. These models are able to diagnose stroke subtype with 30
minutes of monitoring, to predict the exitus during the first 3 hours of
monitoring, and to predict the stroke recurrence in just 15 minutes of
monitoring. Patients with difficult access to a \acrshort{CT} scan, and all
patients that arrive at the stroke unit of a specialized hospital will benefit
from these positive results. The results obtained from the real-time developed
models are the following: stroke diagnosis around $98\%$ precision ($97.8\%$
Sensitivity, $99.5\%$ Specificity), exitus prediction with $99.8\%$ precision
($99.8\%$ Sens., $99.9\%$ Spec.) and $98\%$ precision predicting stroke
recurrence ($98\%$ Sens., $99\%$ Spec.).

  Driver-Assistance System",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are increasing concerns about malicious attacks on autonomous vehicles.
In particular, inaudible voice command attacks pose a significant threat as
voice commands become available in autonomous driving systems. How to
empirically defend against these inaudible attacks remains an open question.
Previous research investigates utilizing deep learning-based multimodal fusion
for defense, without considering the model uncertainty in trustworthiness. As
deep learning has been applied to increasingly sensitive tasks, uncertainty
measurement is crucial in helping improve model robustness, especially in
mission-critical scenarios. In this paper, we propose the Multimodal Fusion
Framework (MFF) as an intelligent security system to defend against inaudible
voice command attacks. MFF fuses heterogeneous audio-vision modalities using
VGG family neural networks and achieves the detection accuracy of 92.25% in the
comparative fusion method empirical study. Additionally, extensive experiments
on audio-vision tasks reveal the model's uncertainty. Using Expected
Calibration Errors, we measure calibration errors and Monte-Carlo Dropout to
estimate the predictive distribution for the proposed models. Our findings show
empirically to train robust multimodal models, improve standard accuracy and
provide a further step toward interpretability. Finally, we discuss the pros
and cons of our approach and its applicability for Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems.

particular, related to still images, with task-specific optimization yielding
very strong performance. Nevertheless, human-centric action recognition is
still largely dominated by hand-crafted pipelines, and only individual
components are replaced by neural networks that typically operate on individual
frames. As a testbed to study the relevance of such pipelines, we present a new
fully annotated video dataset of fitness activities. Any recognition
capabilities in this domain are almost exclusively a function of human poses
and their temporal dynamics, so pose-based solutions should perform well. We
show that, with this labelled data, end-to-end learning on raw pixels can
compete with state-of-the-art action recognition pipelines based on pose
estimation. We also show that end-to-end learning can support temporally
fine-grained tasks such as real-time repetition counting.

RGB space. Despite some achievements in transferability and attack success
rate, the crafted adversarial examples are easily perceived by human eyes.
Towards visual imperceptibility, some recent works explore unrestricted attacks
without $L_p$-norm constraints, yet lacking transferability of attacking
black-box models. In this work, we propose a novel imperceptible and
transferable attack by leveraging both the generative and discriminative power
of diffusion models. Specifically, instead of direct manipulation in pixel
space, we craft perturbations in latent space of diffusion models. Combined
with well-designed content-preserving structures, we can generate
human-insensitive perturbations embedded with semantic clues. For better
transferability, we further ""deceive"" the diffusion model which can be viewed
as an additional recognition surrogate, by distracting its attention away from
the target regions. To our knowledge, our proposed method, DiffAttack, is the
first that introduces diffusion models into adversarial attack field. Extensive
experiments on various model structures (including CNNs, Transformers, MLPs)
and defense methods have demonstrated our superiority over other attack
methods.

perform specific tasks with a high degree of efficiency. Therefore, it is

trained on broad data that can be adapted to various downstream tasks. The
recently proposed segment anything model (SAM) has made significant progress in
breaking the boundaries of segmentation, greatly promoting the development of
foundation models for computer vision. To fully comprehend SAM, we conduct a
survey study. As the first to comprehensively review the progress of segmenting
anything task for vision and beyond based on the foundation model of SAM, this
work focuses on its applications to various tasks and data types by discussing
its historical development, recent progress, and profound impact on broad
applications. We first introduce the background and terminology for foundation
models including SAM, as well as state-of-the-art methods contemporaneous with
SAM that are significant for segmenting anything task. Then, we analyze and
summarize the advantages and limitations of SAM across various image processing
applications, including software scenes, real-world scenes, and complex scenes.
Importantly, many insights are drawn to guide future research to develop more

systems though with different mass ratios ($1/q$ = 0.27--0.62). The effective
temperature differences between binary components are around a few hundred
Kelvins. The original definition of A- and W-subtypes were compared with the
customarily used methods which rely on the shape or on the photometric

therefore the radial velocity analysis is strongly recommended. Through a
collection of all available K-type contact binaries with both photometric and

escape of ionizing photons to study both its variability with galaxy assembly
and the resulting key reionization sources. In this model, leakage either
occurs through a fully ionized gas distribution (ionization bounded) or
additionally through channels cleared of gas by supernova explosions
(ionization bounded + holes). The escape fraction is therefore governed by a
combination of the density and star formation rate. Having calibrated our star
formation efficiencies to match high-$z$ observables, we find the central gas
density to regulate the boundary between high ($>0.70$) and low ($<0.06$)
escape fractions. As galaxies become denser at higher redshifts, this boundary
shifts from $M_{h}\simeq 10^{9.5}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z\sim 5$ to
$M_{h}\simeq 10^{7.8}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ at $z\sim 15$. While leakage is
entirely governed through holes above this mass range, it is not affecting
general trends for lower masses. We find the co-evolution of galaxy assembly
and the degree of leakage to be mass and redshift dependent, driven by an
increasing fraction of $f_{\mathrm{esc}}<0.06$ galaxies at increasing mass and
redshift. The variability in the escape of ionizing photons is driven by the
underlying variations in our dark matter assembly histories. Galaxies with $M_h
< 10^{7.9} ~ (10^{8.9})M_{\odot}$ provide half of the escaping ionizing
emissivity by $z \sim 10 ~ (5)$ in the ionization bounded model. On the other
hand, galaxies that purely leak through holes contribute $6$ $(13)\%$ at $z\sim
5$ $(15)$. We end by exploring the impact of two reionization feedback
scenarios, in which we suppress the gas content of galaxies with
$T_{\mathrm{vir}}<20000\mathrm{K}$ and $v_{c}<30\mathrm{kms^{-1}}$ residing in
ionized regions.

non-linear manifolds to linear subspaces for the purpose of classification and
clustering. Despite significant advantages, the subspace structure of data in
the original space is not preserved in the embedding space. To address this
issue subspace clustering has been proposed by replacing the SE graph affinity
with a self-expression matrix. It works well if the data lies in a union of
linear subspaces however, the performance may degrade in real-world
applications where data often spans non-linear manifolds. To address this
problem we propose a novel structure-aware deep spectral embedding by combining
a spectral embedding loss and a structure preservation loss. To this end, a
deep neural network architecture is proposed that simultaneously encodes both
types of information and aims to generate structure-aware spectral embedding.
The subspace structure of the input data is encoded by using attention-based
self-expression learning. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on six publicly

Geometric criteria are used to verify expected velocity field properties, such
as net rotation and symmetry, by tracing velocity components along a circular
path surrounding each eddy center. Progressive searches outward and into deeper
layers yield each eddy's 3D region of influence. Isolation of each eddy
structure from the dataset, using it's cylindrical footprint, facilitates
visualization of internal eddy structures using horizontal velocity, vertical

the advantages of providing eddy structures with verified rotation properties,
3D visualization of the internal structure of physical properties, and rapid
efficient estimations of eddy footprints without calculating streamlines. Our

varying and observational in nature with the aim of establishing cause and

presence of unmeasured spatial confounders. 'spatial confounding' is the
phenomenon in which the spatial residuals are correlated to the spatial
covariates in the model, when unaccounted for it can lead to biased causal
effect estimates. This paper develops a novel method that adjusts for the
spatial confounding bias under a spatial-causal inference framework when the
treatment is binary. By combining tools from spatial statistics and causal
inference literature, we propose a method that reduces the bias due to spatial
confounding. We partially recover the unmeasured spatial confounder using the
spatial residuals and propose an improved doubly robust estimator based on it.
Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed doubly robust
estimator outperforms the existing methods and has the lowest bias and close to
nominal coverage in most scenarios. Finally, we implement our method to
estimate the effect of installing SCR/SNCR NOx emission control technologies on
ambient ozone concentrations.

of such defects between bulk-like and few-layer films, showing alteration of
the zero-phonon line energies, modifications to their phonon sidebands, and
enhancements of their inhomogeneous broadenings. To disentangle the various
mechanisms responsible for these changes, including the atomic structure,

For each stock, in dollar-volume-weighted transaction time, the discrepancy

process with Hurst exponent 0.465, that is, slightly mean-reverting. As a
check, we execute an arbitrage strategy on simulated Hurst-exponent data, and a
comparable strategy in backtesting on the actual data, obtaining similar
results (annualized returns $\sim 60$\% if zero transaction costs). Next
examining the cross-correlation structure of the $\sim 1000$ stocks, we find
that, counterintuitively, correlations increase with time lag in the range
studied. We show that this behavior that can be quantitatively explained if the
mean-reverting Hurst component of each stock is uncorrelated, i.e., does not

of transient noise, colloquially referred to as glitches. These glitches can
often be misidentified as gravitational waves by searches for unmodeled
transients using the excess-power type of methods and sometimes even excite
template waveforms for compact binary coalescences while using matched filter
techniques. They thus create a significant background in the searches. This
background is more critical in getting identified promptly and efficiently
within the context of real-time searches for gravitational-wave transients.
Such searches are the ones that have enabled multi-messenger astrophysics with
the start of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo data taking in 2015 and they
will continue to enable the field for further discoveries. With this work we
propose and demonstrate the use of a signal-based test that quantifies the
fidelity of the time-frequency decomposition of the putative signal based on
first principles on how astrophysical transients are expected to be registered
in the detectors and empirically measuring the instrumental noise. It is based
on the Q-transform and a measure of the occupancy of the corresponding
time-frequency pixels over select time-frequency volumes; we call it ``QoQ''.
Our method shows a 40% reduction in the number of retraction of public alerts
that were issued by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations during the third
observing run with negligible loss in sensitivity. Receiver Operator
Characteristic measurements suggest the method can be used in online and
offline searches for transients, reducing their background significantly.

a growing need for efficient and effective methods for processing and
understanding video data. Traditional full video decoding techniques can be
computationally intensive and time-consuming, leading researchers to explore
alternative approaches in the compressed domain. This study introduces a novel
random perturbation-based compressed domain method for reconstructing images
from High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) bitstreams, specifically designed for
traffic surveillance applications. To the best of our knowledge, our method is
the first to propose substituting random perturbations for residual values,
creating a condensed representation of the original image while retaining
information relevant to video understanding tasks, particularly focusing on
vehicle detection and classification as key use cases.
  By not using residual data, our proposed method significantly reduces the
data needed in the image reconstruction process, allowing for more efficient
storage and transmission of information. This is particularly important when
considering the vast amount of video data involved in surveillance
applications. Applied to the public BIT-Vehicle dataset, we demonstrate a
significant increase in the reconstruction speed compared to the traditional
full decoding approach, with our proposed method being approximately 56% faster
than the pixel domain method. Additionally, we achieve a detection accuracy of
99.9%, on par with the pixel domain method, and a classification accuracy of
96.84%, only 0.98% lower than the pixel domain method. Furthermore, we showcase
the significant reduction in data size, leading to more efficient storage and
transmission. Our research establishes the potential of compressed domain
methods in traffic surveillance applications, where speed and data size are
critical factors.

the complexity of which was studied in the white box and black box models. In
the black box model, we are given a graph $G = (V,E)$ and oracle access to a
function $f : V \to \mathbb{R}$. The local search problem is to find a vertex
$v$ that is a local minimum, i.e. with $f(v) \leq f(u)$ for all $(u,v) \in E$,
using as few queries as possible. The query complexity is well understood on
the grid and the hypercube, but much less is known beyond.
  We show the query complexity of local search on $d$-regular expanders with
constant degree is $\Omega\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log{n}}\right)$, where $n$ is
the number of vertices. This matches within a logarithmic factor the upper
bound of $O(\sqrt{n})$ for constant degree graphs from Aldous (1983), implying
that steepest descent with a warm start is an essentially optimal algorithm for
expanders. The best lower bound known from prior work was
$\Omega\left(\frac{\sqrt[8]{n}}{\log{n}}\right)$, shown by Santha and Szegedy
(2004) for quantum and randomized algorithms.
  We obtain this result by considering a broader framework of graph features
such as vertex congestion and separation number. We show that for each graph,
the randomized query complexity of local search is
$\Omega\left(\frac{n^{1.5}}{g}\right)$, where $g$ is the vertex congestion of
the graph; and $\Omega\left(\sqrt[4]{\frac{s}{\Delta}}\right)$, where $s$ is
the separation number and $\Delta$ is the maximum degree. For separation number
the previous bound was $\Omega\left(\sqrt[8]{\frac{s}{\Delta}}
/\log{n}\right)$, given by Santha and Szegedy for quantum and randomized
algorithms.
  We also show a variant of the relational adversary method from Aaronson
(2006), which is asymptotically at least as strong as the version in Aaronson

been developed. However, existing methods are usually tailored to process

In this paper, we investigate the effect of ""matter"" on the propagation time
delay of photons emitted by a pulsar orbiting a spinning black hole, one of the
most important relativistic effect in pulsar timing. We deduce an analytical
formula for the time delay from geodesic equations, showing how it changes as
the type of matter around the black hole (radiation, dust or dark energy)
varies with respect to previous results, where matter has not been taken into
account. It turns out that while the spin $a$ only induces a shift in the phase
of the maximum delay without increasing or decreasing the delay, the effect of
matter surrounding the black hole results in a noticeable alteration of it. We
also find that dark energy would give the biggest effect, and that in any case
a degeneracy between matter and spin could arise, invalidating an accurate
measurement of the latter from pulsar timing.

irradiation was used to probe the nature of the Verwey transition in magnetite,
$\text{Fe}_{3}\text{O}_{4}$. Two large single crystals, one with optimal
transition temperature, $T_{V}\approx121$ K, and another with $T_{V}\approx109$
K, as well as biogenic nanocrystals, $T_{V}\approx110$ K, were examined.
Temperature-dependent resistivity is consistent with the
semiconductor-to-semiconductor sharp, step-like Verwey transition from a state
with a small bandgap of around 60 meV to a state with a larger bandgap of about
300 meV. The irradiation causes an up-shift of the resistivity curves above the
transition without transition smearing or broadening. It also causes an
apparent down-shift of the resistivity maximum at high temperatures. In the
lower $T_{V}$ crystal, the electron irradiation drives the transition
temperature into a ``forbidden"" regime believed to separate the first order
from the second order phase transition. Contrary to this belief, the transition
itself remains sharp and hysteretic without a significant change in the
hysteresis width. We conclude that the sudden change of the bandgap accompanied
by the monoclinic distortion and the change of magnetic anisotropy is the
reason for the Verwey transition in magnetite and the effect of additional
disorder is mostly in the smearing of the sharp gap edges near the Fermi level.

nonlinear nature of the dynamics. We study the local dynamics of GDA for

based on a linearization of a non-linear dynamical system that describes the
GDA iterations, under an \textit{isolated points model} assumption from [Becker

regularization, and the bandwidth of the kernel discriminator, on the local
convergence rate of GDA. Importantly, we show phase transitions that indicate
when the system converges, oscillates, or diverges. We also provide numerical

  Methodology",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When studying the association between treatment and a clinical outcome, a
parametric multivariable model of the conditional outcome expectation is often
used to adjust for covariates. The treatment coefficient of the outcome model
targets a conditional treatment effect. Model-based standardization is
typically applied to average the model predictions over the target covariate
distribution, and generate a covariate-adjusted estimate of the marginal
treatment effect. The standard approach to model-based standardization involves
maximum-likelihood estimation and use of the non-parametric bootstrap. We
introduce a novel, general-purpose, model-based standardization method based on
multiple imputation that is easily applicable when the outcome model is a
generalized linear model. We term our proposed approach multiple imputation
marginalization (MIM). MIM consists of two main stages: the generation of
synthetic datasets and their analysis. MIM accommodates a Bayesian statistical
framework, which naturally allows for the principled propagation of
uncertainty, integrates the analysis into a probabilistic framework, and allows
for the incorporation of prior evidence. We conduct a simulation study to
benchmark the finite-sample performance of MIM in conjunction with a parametric
outcome model. The simulations provide proof-of-principle in scenarios with
binary outcomes, continuous-valued covariates, a logistic outcome model and the
marginal log odds ratio as the target effect measure. When parametric modeling
assumptions hold, MIM yields unbiased estimation in the target covariate
distribution, valid coverage rates, and similar precision and efficiency than
the standard approach to model-based standardization.

A few person-specific methods can generate vivid videos but require the target

procedures. First, we devise a novel Transformer-based landmark generator to
infer lip and jaw landmarks from the audio. Prior landmark characteristics of
the speaker's face are employed to make the generated landmarks coincide with
the facial outline of the speaker. Then, a video rendering model is built to
translate the generated landmarks into face images. During this stage, prior
appearance information is extracted from the lower-half occluded target face
and static reference images, which helps generate realistic and
identity-preserving visual content. For effectively exploring the prior
information of static reference images, we align static reference images with
the target face's pose and expression based on motion fields. Moreover,
auditory features are reused to guarantee that the generated face images are
well synchronized with the audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can produce more realistic, lip-synced, and identity-preserving videos

  To the best of our knowledge, NFR is the first approach to provide realistic
and controllable deformations of in-the-wild facial meshes, without the manual
creation of blendshapes or correspondence. We design a deformation autoencoder

super-Yang-Mills theory. We determine this integrated correlator at the five
lowest non-trivial orders in $1/\sqrt{N}$ at fixed Yang-Mills coupling and

of this influence of MVPs on SE practices is still poor. [Objective] Our goal
is to characterize the publication landscape on practices that have been used
in the context of software MVPs and to gather practitioner insights on the
identified practices. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study and
discussed its results in two focus groups sessions involving twelve industry
practitioners that extensively use MVPs in their projects to capture their
perceptions on the findings of the mapping study. [Results] We identified 33
papers published between 2013 and 2020 and observed some trends related to MVP
ideation and evaluation practices. For instance, regarding ideation, we found
six different approaches and mainly informal end-user involvement practices.
Regarding evaluation, there is an emphasis on end-user validations based on
practices such as usability tests, A/B testing, and usage data analysis.
However, there is still limited research related to MVP technical feasibility
assessment and effort estimation. Practitioners of the focus group sessions
reinforced the confidence in our results regarding ideation and evaluation
practices, being aware of most of the identified practices. They also reported
how they deal with the technical feasibility assessments and effort estimation
in practice. [Conclusion] Our analysis suggests that there are opportunities
for solution proposals and evaluation studies to address literature gaps
concerning technical feasibility assessment and effort estimation. Overall,
more effort needs to be invested into empirically evaluating the existing

of work has focused on automatically generating reports with NLP methods.
However, different audiences have different purposes when writing/reading
medical reports -- for example, healthcare professionals care more about
pathology, whereas patients are more concerned with the diagnosis (""Is there
any abnormality?""). The expectation gap results in a common situation where
patients find their medical reports to be ambiguous and therefore unsure about
the next steps. In this work, we explore the audience expectation gap in
healthcare and summarize common ambiguities that lead patients to be confused
about their diagnosis into three categories: medical jargon, contradictory
findings, and misleading grammatical errors. Based on our analysis, we define a
disambiguation rewriting task to regenerate an input to be unambiguous while
preserving information about the original content. We further propose a
rewriting algorithm based on contrastive pretraining and perturbation-based
rewriting. In addition, we create two datasets, OpenI-Annotated based on chest

binary labels for ambiguity and abnormality presence annotated by radiology

processes and their study has significant implications for drug development and
disease diagnosis. Existing deep learning methods suffer from significant
performance degradation under complex real-world scenarios due to various
factors, e.g., label scarcity and domain shift. In this paper, we propose a
self-ensembling multigraph neural network (SemiGNN-PPI) that can effectively
predict PPIs while being both efficient and generalizable. In SemiGNN-PPI, we
not only model the protein correlations but explore the label dependencies by
constructing and processing multiple graphs from the perspectives of both
features and labels in the graph learning process. We further marry GNN with
Mean Teacher to effectively leverage unlabeled graph-structured PPI data for
self-ensemble graph learning. We also design multiple graph consistency
constraints to align the student and teacher graphs in the feature embedding
space, enabling the student model to better learn from the teacher model by
incorporating more relationships. Extensive experiments on PPI datasets of
different scales with different evaluation settings demonstrate that
SemiGNN-PPI outperforms state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods, particularly
in challenging scenarios such as training with limited annotations and testing
on unseen data.

local or global history and thus are inherently hard to predict correctly by
conventional branch predictors. We propose a software-to-hardware branch
pre-resolution mechanism that allows software to pass branch outcomes to the
processor frontend ahead of fetching the branch instruction. A compiler pass
identifies the instruction chain leading to the branch (the branch backslice)
and generates the pre-execute code that produces the branch outcomes ahead of
the frontend observing them. The loop structure helps to unambiguously map the
branch outcomes to their corresponding dynamic instances of the branch
instruction. Our approach also allows for covering the loop iteration space
selectively, with arbitrarily complex patterns. Our method for pre-execution
enables important optimizations such as unrolling and vectorization, in order
to substantially reduce the pre-execution overhead. Experimental results on
select workloads from SPEC CPU 2017 and graph analytics workloads show up to
95% reduction of MPKI (21% on average), up to 39% speedup (7% on average), and
up to 3x improvement on IPC (23% on average) compared to a core with

LiDAR map-based methods are pervasive since their robustness under different

better accuracy since matching features between the same type of data is

of LiDAR, cross-media methods are developing, which combined live image data
and Lidar map. Although matching features between different media is
challenging, we believe cross-media is the tendency for AV relocalization since
its low cost and accuracy can be comparable to the same-sensor-based methods.
In this paper, we propose CMSG, a novel cross-media algorithm for AV
relocalization tasks. Semantic features are utilized for better interpretation
the correlation between point clouds and image features. What's more,
abstracted semantic graph nodes are introduced, and a graph network

our work on {\em LTLf model checking}. LTLf model checking, however, is not
straightforward. The strategies generated by LTLf synthesis may be represented
using {\em terminating} transducers or {\em non-terminating} transducers where

For synthesis, there is no evidence that one type of transducer is better than
the other since they both demonstrate the same complexity and similar
algorithms.
  In this work, we show that for model checking, the two types of transducers
are fundamentally different. Our central result is that LTLf model checking of
non-terminating transducers is \emph{exponentially harder} than that of
terminating transducers. We show that the problems are EXPSPACE-complete and
PSPACE-complete, respectively. Hence, considering the feasibility of
verification, LTLf synthesis tools should synthesize terminating transducers.

property which directly affects the operation and performance of ferroelectric
devices. In conventional ferroelectric materials, the typical ferroelectric
switching mechanism is governed by a universal process of domain wall motion.
However, recent experiments indicate that Van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6
possesses anomalous polarization switching dynamics under an electric field. It
is important to understand the switching dynamics, but it remains theoretically
unexplored in CuInP2S6 due to the lack of description of its order-disorder
phase transition characteristics by density functional theory. Here, we employ
a machine-learning potential trained from the first principles density
functional theory dataset to conduct the large-scale atomistic simulations of
temperature-driven order-disorder ferroelectric phase transition in CuInP2S6.
Most importantly, it is found that the electric field-driven polarization
switching in CuInP2S6 is mediated by single Cu dipole flip, rather than
conventional domain wall motion mechanism. This intrinsic unconventional
switching behavior can be attributed to the competition between the energy
barrier of domain wall motion and single dipole flip.

but the lack of expressivity in CRBMs have limited their widespread adoption.
Here we introduce Neural Boltzmann Machines (NBMs) which generalize CRBMs by
converting each of the CRBM parameters to their own neural networks that are
allowed to be functions of the conditional inputs. NBMs are highly flexible
conditional generative models that can be trained via stochastic gradient
descent to approximately maximize the log-likelihood of the data. We
demonstrate the utility of NBMs especially with normally distributed data which
has historically caused problems for Gaussian-Bernoulli CRBMs. Code to

associated with a fast coronal mass ejection (CME) propagating in the southwest
direction with an apparent speed of $\sim$926 km s$^{-1}$. Meanwhile, a shock
wave is driven by the CME at the flank. The eruption of CME generates an
extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wave expanding outward from the flare site with an
apparent speed of $\geq$200 km s$^{-1}$. As the EUV wave propagates eastward,
it encounters and interacts with the low-lying adjacent coronal loops (ACLs),
which are composed of two loops. The compression of EUV wave results in
contraction, expansion, and transverse vertical oscillations of ACLs. The
commencements of contraction are sequential from western to eastern footpoints
and the contraction lasts for $\sim$15 minutes. The speeds of contraction lie
in the range of 13$-$40 km s$^{-1}$ in 171 {\AA} and 8$-$54 km s$^{-1}$ in 193
{\AA}. A long, gradual expansion follows the contraction at lower speeds.
Concurrent vertical oscillations are superposed on contraction and expansion of
ACLs. The oscillations last for 2$-$9 cycles and the amplitudes are $\leq$4 Mm.
The periods are between 3 to 12 minutes with an average value of 6.7 minutes.

first stratifies the sample according to observed baseline covariates and then
assigns treatment randomly within these strata so as to achieve balance
according to pre-specified stratum-specific target assignment proportions. In
this paper, we compute the semiparametric efficiency bound for estimating the
average treatment effect (ATE) in such experiments with binary treatments
allowing for the class of CAR procedures considered in Bugni, Canay, and Shaikh

propensity score conditional on all baseline covariates (and not just the

the bound in Hahn (1998), but conditional on all baseline covariates.
Additionally, this efficiency bound is shown to be achievable under the same

acceleration of ray tracing has been studied for a long period of time because
algorithms such as light transport simulations require a large amount of ray
tracing. One of the major approaches to accelerate the intersections is to use
bounding volumes for early pruning for primitives in the volume. The
axis-aligned bounding box is a popular bounding volume for ray tracing because
of its simplicity and efficiency. However, the conservative bounding volume may
produce extra empty space in addition to its content. Especially, primitives
that are thin and diagonal to the axis give false-positive hits on the box
volume due to the extra space. Although more complex bounding volumes such as
oriented bounding boxes may reduce more false-positive hits, they are
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel culling approach
to reduce false-positive hits for the bounding box by embedding a binary voxel
data structure to the volume. As a ray is represented as a conservative voxel
volume as well in our approach, the ray--voxel intersection is cheaply done by
bitwise AND operations. Our method is applicable to hierarchical data
structures such as bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). It reduces false-positive
hits due to the ray--box test and reduces the number of intersections during
the traversal of BVH in ray tracing. We evaluate the reduction of intersections
with several scenes and show the possibility of performance improvement despite
the culling overhead. We also introduce a compression approach with a lookup
table for our voxel data. We show that our compressed voxel data achieves
significant false-positive reductions with a small amount of memory.

negative effects of game design elements and to provide insights into the
awareness of developers on these effects and into how they could be considered
in practice. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative
effects of game design elements on education/learning systems. We also held a
focus group discussion with developers of a gamified software, discussing the
mapping study results with regard to their awareness and perceptions on the
reported negative effects in practice. Results: The mapping study revealed 87
papers reporting undesired effects of game design elements. We found that
badges, leaderboards, competitions, and points are the game design elements
most often reported as causing negative effects. The most cited negative
effects were lack of effect, worsened performance, motivational issues, lack of
understanding, and irrelevance. The ethical issues of gaming the system and
cheating were also often reported. As part of our results, we map the relations

focus group revealed that developers were not aware of many of the possible
negative effects and that they consider this type of information useful. The
discussion revealed their agreement on some of those potential negative effects

applied, can have positive effects on education/learning software. However,
gamified software is also prone to generate harmful effects. Revealing and
discussing potentially negative effects can help to make more informed

expand questions in terms of Wiktionary commonsense knowledge of keywords, and
reformulate them with normalized patterns. Dense passage retrieval is utilized
for capturing relevant knowledge, and different PLM-based (BART, GPT2 and T5)

ELECTRA-based answer ranking model, where logistic regression is conducted
during training, with the aim of approximating different levels of plausibility

ProtoQA show that KEPR obtains substantial improvements, compared to the strong
baselines. Within the experimental models, the T5-based GenCQA with KEPR
obtains the best performance, which is up to 60.91% at the primary canonical

on the utterance profiling of a single interlocutor and graph-based interaction
modeling. The corresponding solutions contribute to the answer-oriented
reasoning on a series of well-organized and thread-aware conversational

On the one hand, a pronoun like ""it"" most probably produces multi-skip

mixture of inner linguistic features in utterances and external interactive
features among utterances. To overcome the bottlenecks, we propose a

modes are less efficiently damped than traveling waves, meaning that prior
estimates of tidal spin-up may be overestimated. We show that tidal
synchronization is rarely reached in WR-BH binaries, and the resulting BH spins
have $a \lesssim 0.4$ for all but the shortest period ($P_{\rm orb} \! \lesssim
0.5 \, {\rm d}$) binaries. Tidal spin-up in lower-mass systems is more
efficient, providing an anti-correlation between the mass and spin of the BHs,
which could be tested in future gravitational wave data. Non-linear damping
processes are poorly understood but may allow for more efficient tidal spin-up.
We also discuss a new class of gravito-thermal modes that appear in our
calculations.

platform for realizing a Majorana zero mode trapped by a vison excitation. This
local mode behaves as a non-Abelian anyon capable of applications to quantum
computation. However, creating, observing, and manipulating visons remain
challenging even in the pristine Kitaev model. Here, we propose a theory to
control visons enabled by a time-dependent local magnetic field in the Kitaev
spin liquid. Examining the time evolution of the magnetic state, we demonstrate
that a vison follows a locally applied field sweeping in the system. We clarify
that one can move a vison accompanied by a Majorana zero mode by choosing the
velocity and shape of the local field appropriately. In particular, the
controllability of visons using local fields shows nonlinear behavior for its
strength, which originates from interactions between Majorana fermions and
visons. The present results suggest that itinerant Majorana fermions other than
zero modes play a crucial role in vison transport. Our finding will offer a
guideline for controlling Majorana zero modes in the Kitaev quantum spin

shock sensing criterion to detect and limit oscillations due to shocks while
applying a different criterion to detect and limit oscillations due to contact
discontinuities. Furthermore, the method is general in the sense that it can be
applied to any method that employs characteristic transformation and shock

analytical expression of the energy spectrum divides the system parameters into
two regimes -- in one region, the strength of Hermitian KSEA interactions

of a density matrix [Yu X-D., {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 127}, 060504

moments are related with entanglement and with well known idea of principal
minors. In this work, we analytically demonstrate that for qubit-qubit quantum
systems, partial transpose moments can be expressed as simple functions of
principal minors. We expect this relation to exist for every bipartite quantum
systems. In addition, we have extended the idea of PT-moments for tripartite
qubit systems and have shown that PT-moments can only detect the whole range of
being NPT for $GHZ$ and $W$ states mixed with white noise.

GPT-3, their performances still significantly underperform fine-tuned models in
the task of text classification. This is due to (1) the lack of reasoning
ability in addressing complex linguistic phenomena (e.g., intensification,
contrast, irony etc); (2) limited number of tokens allowed in in-context
learning.
  In this paper, we introduce Clue And Reasoning Prompting (CARP). CARP adopts
a progressive reasoning strategy tailored to addressing the complex linguistic
phenomena involved in text classification: CARP first prompts LLMs to find
superficial clues (e.g., keywords, tones, semantic relations, references, etc),
based on which a diagnostic reasoning process is induced for final decisions.
To further address the limited-token issue, CARP uses a fine-tuned model on the
supervised dataset for $k$NN demonstration search in the in-context learning,
allowing the model to take the advantage of both LLM's generalization ability
and the task-specific evidence provided by the full labeled dataset.
Remarkably, CARP yields new SOTA performances on 4 out of 5 widely-used
text-classification benchmarks, 97.39 (+1.24) on SST-2, 96.40 (+0.72) on
AGNews, 98.78 (+0.25) on R8 and 96.95 (+0.6) on R52, and a performance
comparable to SOTA on MR (92.39 v.s. 93.3). More importantly, we find that CARP
delivers impressive abilities on low-resource and domain-adaptation setups.
Specifically, using 16 examples per class, CARP achieves comparable
performances to supervised models with 1,024 examples per class.

initial stage of recrystallization - nucleation of new grains - determines its
later stages. The accepted mechanisms of recrystallization nucleation are based
on the assumption that embryos with orientations of the nuclei preexist in the
deformed matrix. However, this standard picture seems to be incomplete. There
are indications that, in some cases, the deformed matrix has no orientations
observed in recrystallized material. Therefore a mechanism of early stage
recrystallization without preexisting embryos is considered. Since the
recrystallization growth shows strong orientation selection, and the
recrystallization front is believed to migrate through collective shuffling of
atoms, it is postulated that the shuffling mechanism responsible for oriented
growth of a recrystallizing grain extends to the very beginning of the grain's
existence, i.e., that a new orientation can be created via rearrangement of
atoms in a strained region. The postulate explains the formation of new
orientations, and it has the potential to significantly change the
understanding of the early phase of recrystallization.

generalized Wigner crystal states for the fractional fillings (v = 1/3, 2/3,

magnetic field, and they are strongest at one magnetic flux quantum per three

30 Tesla, which can be described by a Mott-Hofstadter transition at high

highlight the opportunities to discover new correlated quantum phases due to
the interplay between the magnetic field and moir\'e flatbands.

possible column distances for the maximum number of time instants and thus have
outstanding error-correcting capability especially for streaming applications.
Explicit constructions of such codes are scarce in the literature. In
particular, known constructions of convolutional codes with rate k/n and a
maximum distance profile require a field of size at least exponential in n for
general code parameters. At the same time, the only known lower bound on the
field size is the trivial bound that is linear in n. In this paper, we show
that a finite field of size $\Omega_L(n^{L-1})$ is necessary for constructing
convolutional codes with rate k/n and a maximum distance profile of length L.
As a direct consequence, this rules out the possibility of constructing
convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile of length L >= 3 over a
finite field of size O(n).
  Additionally, we also present an explicit construction of convolutional code

analysis in recent years. However, the local nature of the convolution operator
inhibits the CNNs from capturing global and long-range interactions. Recently,
Transformers have gained popularity in the computer vision community and also
medical image segmentation. But scalability issues of self-attention mechanism
and lack of the CNN like inductive bias have limited their adoption. In this
work, we present MaxViT-UNet, an Encoder-Decoder based hybrid vision
transformer for medical image segmentation. The proposed hybrid decoder, also
based on MaxViT-block, is designed to harness the power of convolution and
self-attention mechanism at each decoding stage with minimal computational
burden. The multi-axis self-attention in each decoder stage helps in
differentiating between the object and background regions much more
efficiently. The hybrid decoder block initially fuses the lower level features
upsampled via transpose convolution, with skip-connection features coming from
hybrid encoder, then fused features are refined using multi-axis attention
mechanism. The proposed decoder block is repeated multiple times to accurately
segment the nuclei regions. Experimental results on MoNuSeg dataset proves the
effectiveness of the proposed technique. Our MaxViT-UNet outperformed the
previous CNN only (UNet) and Transformer only (Swin-UNet) techniques by a large
margin of 2.36% and 5.31% on Dice metric respectively.

the transverse field, the effects of quantum coherence are studied by Fisher

not only recovers DQPT destroyed by thermal fluctuations, but also generates
some entirely new DQPTs which are independent of equilibrium quantum critical

sufficient to generate DQPT because it also requires the Fisher zeros to be
tightly bound close enough to the neighborhood of the imaginary axis. It can be
manifested that DQPTs are rooted in quantum fluctuations. This work sheds new
light on the fundamental connection between quantum critical phenomena and
quantum coherence.

(CNNs), which are believed to be vital drivers behind CNNs' exceptional
performance on vision-like tasks. We first analyze the universality of CNNs,
i.e., the ability to approximate continuous functions. We prove that a depth of
$\mathcal{O}(\log d)$ is sufficient for achieving universality, where $d$ is
the input dimension. This is a significant improvement over existing results
that required a depth of $\Omega(d)$. We also prove that learning sparse
functions with CNNs needs only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^2d)$ samples,
indicating that deep CNNs can efficiently capture long-range sparse
correlations. Note that all these are achieved through a novel combination of
increased network depth and the utilization of multichanneling and
downsampling.
  Lastly, we study the inductive biases of weight sharing and locality through
the lens of symmetry. To separate two biases, we introduce locally-connected
networks (LCNs), which can be viewed as CNNs without weight sharing.
Specifically, we compare the performance of CNNs, LCNs, and fully-connected
networks (FCNs) on a simple regression task. We prove that LCNs require
${\Omega}(d)$ samples while CNNs need only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^2d)$
samples, which highlights the cruciality of weight sharing. We also prove that
FCNs require $\Omega(d^2)$ samples while LCNs need only
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples, demonstrating the importance of locality.
These provable separations quantify the difference between the two biases, and
our major observation behind is that weight sharing and locality break
different symmetries in the learning process.

denoted by $d(G)$. Given a finite group $G$ and an integer $k$, deciding if
$d(G)\leq k$ is known as the minimum generating set (MIN-GEN) problem.
  A group $G$ of order $n$ has generating set of size $\lceil \log_p n \rceil$
where $p$ is the smallest prime dividing $n=|G|$. This fact is used to design
an $n^{\log_p n+O(1)}$-time algorithm for the group isomorphism problem of
groups specified by their Cayley tables (attributed to Tarjan by Miller, 1978).
The same fact can be used to give an $n^{\log_p n+O(1)}$-time algorithm for the
MIN-GEN problem. We show that the MIN-GEN problem can be solved in time
$n^{(1/4)\log_p n+O(1)}$ for general groups given by their Cayley tables. This
runtime incidentally matches with the runtime of the best known algorithm for
the group isomorphism problem.
  We show that if a group $G$, given by its Cayley table, is the product of
simple groups then a minimum generating set of $G$ can be computed in time
polynomial in $|G|$.
  Given groups $G_i$ along with $d(G_i)$ for $i\in [r]$ the problem of
computing $d(\Pi_{i\in[r]} G_i)$ is nontrivial. As a consequence of our result
for products of simple groups we show that this problem also can be solved in
polynomial time for Cayley table representation.
  For the MIN-GEN problem for permutation groups, to the best of our knowledge,
no significantly better algorithm than the brute force algorithm is known. For
an input group $G\leq S_n$, the brute force algorithm runs in time $|G|^{O(n)}$
which can be $2^{\Omega(n^2)}$. We show that if $G\leq S_n$ is a primitive
permutation group then the MIN-GEN problem can be solved in time
quasi-polynomial in $n$.
  We also design a $\mathrm{DTIME}(2^n)$ algorithm for computing a minimum
generating set of permutation groups all of whose non-abelian chief factors
have bounded orders.

strategy to find clues for a better understanding of the superconducting

Ba1-xKxBiO3 possesses a similar perovskite structure to that of the hole-doped
copper-oxide (cuprate) superconductors but also holds a comparatively high
superconducting transition temperature. In this study, we report the first
observation of the pressure-induced quantum phase transition (QPT) from
superconducting to insulating states in a series of Ba1-xKxBiO3 single-crystal
samples. A similar QPT has also been observed recently in the compressed
cuprate superconductors1. Significantly, we found that the QPT observed in
Ba1-xKxBiO3 is intriguingly associated with the valence change of the Bi ions
in the material. These results lead us to propose that the pressure-induced
valence change from Bi3+ to Bi5+ destroys the hole-doping effect on stabilizing
the conductivity and corresponding superconductivity. By comparing the
high-pressure behaviors observed in these two kinds of oxides, we identified
another prominent feature shared by them - the more the hole-doping
concentration, the higher the critical pressure required for driving the QPT.

infrastructure, a new software stack, or even only a new dataset with some
notably different properties is often challenging. Despite the structured
definition of the steps (tasks) and their interdependencies during a complex
data analysis in the DAW specification, relevant assumptions may remain
unspecified and implicit. Such hidden assumptions often lead to crashing tasks
without a reasonable error message, poor performance in general,
non-terminating executions, or silent wrong results of the DAW, to name only a
few possible consequences. Searching for the causes of such errors and
drawbacks in a distributed compute cluster managed by a complex infrastructure
stack, where DAWs for large datasets typically are executed, can be tedious and
time-consuming.
  We propose validity constraints (VCs) as a new concept for DAW languages to
alleviate this situation. A VC is a constraint specifying some logical
conditions that must be fulfilled at certain times for DAW executions to be
valid. When defined together with a DAW, VCs help to improve the portability,
adaptability, and reusability of DAWs by making implicit assumptions explicit.
Once specified, VC can be controlled automatically by the DAW infrastructure,
and violations can lead to meaningful error messages and graceful behaviour
(e.g., termination or invocation of repair mechanisms). We provide a broad list
of possible VCs, classify them along multiple dimensions, and compare them to
similar concepts one can find in related fields. We also provide a first sketch

the topological charge (TC) of an unknown discrete vortex, by analyzing the
interference pattern of a 1D ring array of lasers. The interference pattern of
an unknown discrete vortex with TC$\neq 0$ is averaged with the interference
pattern of TC= 0, which gives rise to a variation in the fringe visibility as a
function of laser number (j) in a 1D ring array. The number of dips observed in
the fringe visibility curve is found to be proportional to the magnitude of TC
of a discrete vortex. The sign of TC is determined by averaging the
interference patterns of unknown discrete vortex (TC$\neq 0$) with known TC=
+1. The number of dips in the fringe visibility curve decreases by one for a
positive TC, and increases by one for a negative TC. Further, we have verified
our method against the phase disorder, and it is found that the phase disorder
does not influence an accurate determination of TC of a discrete vortex. The
working principle as well as numerical and experimental results are presented
for the discrete vortices with TC from small to large values. An excellent
agreement between the experimental results and numerical simulations is found.

  Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been extensively studied, yet,

we address few-shot domain adaptation for video-based activity recognition
(FSDA-AR), which leverages a very small amount of labeled target videos to
achieve effective adaptation. This setting is attractive and promising for
applications, as it requires recording and labeling only a few, or even a
single example per class in the target domain, which often includes activities
that are rare yet crucial to recognize. We construct FSDA-AR benchmarks using
five established datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHEN, Sims4Action, and
Toyota Smart Home. Our results demonstrate that FSDA-AR performs comparably to
unsupervised domain adaptation with significantly fewer (yet labeled) target
examples. We further propose a novel approach, FeatFSDA, to better leverage the
few labeled target domain samples as knowledge guidance. FeatFSDA incorporates
a latent space semantic adjacency loss, a domain prototypical similarity loss,
and a graph-attentive-network-based edge dropout technique. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on all datasets within our FSDA-AR

in mean field control. Our analysis covers cases where the solutions to the
limiting problem may not be unique nor stable. Equivalently the value function
of the limiting problem might not be differentiable on the entire space. Our
main result is then to derive sharp rates of convergence in two distinct
regimes. When the data is sufficiently regular, we obtain rates proportional to
$N^{-1/2}$, with $N$ being the number of particles. When the data is merely
Lipschitz and semi-concave with respect to the first Wasserstein distance, we
obtain rates proportional to $N^{-2/(3d+6)}$. Noticeably, the exponent
$2/(3d+6)$ is close to $1/d$, which is the optimal rate of convergence for
uncontrolled particle systems driven by data with a similar regularity. The key
argument in our approach consists in mollifying the value function of the
limiting problem in order to produce functions that are almost classical
sub-solutions to the limiting Hamilton-Jacobi equation (which is a PDE set on
the space of probability measures). These sub-solutions can be projected onto
finite dimensional spaces and then compared with the value functions associated
with the particle systems. In the end, this comparison is used to prove the
most demanding bound in the estimates. The key challenge therein is thus to
exhibit an appropriate form of mollification. We do so by employing
sup-convolution within a convenient functional Hilbert space. To make the whole
easier, we limit ourselves to the periodic setting. We also provide some
examples to show that our results are sharp up to some extent.

acceleration is a fundamental problem in the study of the heliosphere. Due to
efficient wave-particle interactions of ion-scale waves with charged particles,
these waves are widely believed to be a major contributor to ion energization,
and their contribution considerably depends on the wave occurrence rate. By
analyzing the radial distribution of quasi-monochromatic ion-scale waves
observed by the Parker Solar Probe, this work shows that the wave occurrence
rate is significantly enhanced in the near-Sun solar wind, specifically
21%$-$29% below 0.3 au, in comparison to 6%$-$14% beyond 0.3 au. The radial
decrease of the wave occurrence rate is not only induced by the sampling effect
of a single spacecraft detection, but also by the physics relating to the wave
excitation, such as the enhanced ion beam instability in the near-Sun solar
wind. This work also shows that the wave normal angle $\theta$, the absolute
value of ellipticity $\epsilon$, the wave frequency $f$ normalized by the
proton cyclotron frequency $f_{\mathrm{cp}}$, and the wave amplitude $\delta B$
normalized by the local background magnetic field $B_0$ slightly vary with the
radial distance. The median values of $\theta$, $|\epsilon|$, $f$, and $\delta
B$ are about $9^\circ$, $0.73$, $3f_{\mathrm{cp}}$, and $0.01B_0$,

Alfv\'en ion cyclotron mode wave and the fast-magnetosonic whistler mode wave,

The operator $A$ is assumed to be in the form $[A(v)](x, t) = \alpha(x, v(x,

main results are devoted to proving existence of weak solutions for a wide

which use a model based on a non-sufficient summary of the original data;
modular inference methods which use a model constructed from coupled submodels

relates to the stuck motion of the rolling sphere, and the latter causes the
energy dissipation due to the deformation of granular surface. To characterize
these phenomena, we measured the motion of a sphere rolling up a granular slope
of angle $\alpha$. The initial velocity $v_0$, corresponding initial angular
velocity $\omega_0$, angle of slope $\alpha$, and density of the sphere
$\rho_s$ were varied. As a result, the penetration depth can be scaled solely
by density ratio between the sphere and granular layer. By considering equation
of motion, we estimated the friction due to the slips. Besides, by considering
energy conservation, we defined and estimated the friction due to groove
formation. The energy conservation is also useful to evaluate the maximum

any feasible integer linear program (ILP) has a solution with support size
$s\leq 2m\cdot\log(4m\Delta)$, where $m$ is the number of constraints, and

  Our main combinatorial result are improved support size bounds for ILPs.
  To improve granularity, we analyze for the largest $1$-norm $A_{\max}$ of any

deriving a new bound on the -1 branch of the Lambert $\mathcal{W}$ function.
Additionally, we provide a lower bound of $m\log(A_{\max})$, proving our result

this gap, by allowing for the efficient implementation of discrepancy-theoretic

to low accuracy to approximate the partial coloring method of [Rot17], and
simplifies and generalizes recent work of [JSS23] on fast algorithms for

discrepancy body of interest has exponentially large Gaussian measure and is
expressible as a sublevel set of a symmetric, convex function. We combine this
framework with new tools for proving Gaussian measure lower bounds to give
improved algorithms for a variety of sparsification and coloring problems.
  As a first application, we use our framework to obtain an $\widetilde{O}(m

$\epsilon$-approximate spectral sparsifier of an $m$-edge graph, matching the
sparsity of [BSS14] up to constant factors and improving upon the

indicate that for each $\delta$, there is a threshold in the Bond number
($Bo$), which compares the gravitational effects with surface tension, above
which the draining liquid bulk ruptures. This critical $Bo$ is found to scale
inversely with $\delta$, defining the existence of a quasi-stationary pendant
curtain sustained below the cylinder by surface tension. The interface of the
pendant curtain is unconditionally linearly unstable and is prone to
Rayleigh-Plateau-like, capillarity-driven, and Rayleigh-Taylor, gravity-driven,
instabilities. The linear stability of the quasi-static state along with an
energy analysis of the unstable mode illustrates that while the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability is always present, capillary effects dominate the instability at
small $Bo$, which promotes the formation of pearls enveloping the cylinder. In
contrast, at large $Bo$, capillarity acts in a stabilising way and the
instability is purely gravity-driven, forming underside modulations. We present
the asymptotic energy repartition representing the different physical

regression for spatially indexed count data, its development is relatively
limited compared to that found for linear geographically weighted regression

proposed. The weak development of GWPR can be attributed to the computational
cost and identification problem in the underpinning Poisson regression model.
This study proposes linearized GWPR (L-GWPR) by introducing a log-linear
approximation into the GWPR model to overcome these bottlenecks. Because the
L-GWPR model is identical to the Gaussian GWR model, it is free from the
identification problem, easily implemented, computationally efficient, and
offers similar potential for extension. Specifically, L-GWPR does not require a
double-loop algorithm, which makes GWPR slow for large samples. Furthermore, we
extended L-GWPR by introducing ridge regularization to enhance its stability
(regularized L-GWPR). The results of the Monte Carlo experiments confirmed that
regularized L-GWPR estimates local coefficients accurately and computationally
efficiently. Finally, we compared GWPR and regularized L-GWPR through a crime

partially blocked circular Airy derivative beams (CADBs). The CADB consists of
multiple rings, and partial blocking of CADB with different kinds is achieved
by using symmetric and asymmetric binary amplitude masks, enabling blocking of
inner/outer rings and sectorially. The CADB blocked with different types
possesses the ability to autofocus, however, the required propagation distance
for abrupt autofocusing vary with the amount and types of blocking. The abrupt
autofocusing is quantified by a maximum k-value, and how fast it changes around
the autofocusing distance ($z_{af}$). In particular, CADB blocked with inner
rings (first/two/three) exhibits an abrupt autofocusing, as the k-value sharply
increases [decreases] just before [after] $z_{af}$. The maximum k-value always
occurs at $z_{af}$, which decreases as the number of blocked inner rings
increases. For CADB blocked with outer rings, the k-value gradually changes
around $z_{af}$, indicating a lack of abrupt autofocusing. The value of
$z_{af}$ increases with the number of blocked outer rings. This suggests that
although outer rings contain low intensities, these play an important role in
autofocusing. A sectorially blocked CADB possesses an abrupt autofocusing, and
maximum k-value depends on the amount of blocking. The CADB blocked with
different types possesses good self-healing abilities, where blocked parts
reappear as a result of redistribution of intensity. The maximum self-healing
occurs at $z_{af}$, where an overlap integral approaches a maximum value.
Finally, we have compared ideal CADB and partially blocked CADB having the same
radii, and found that an ideal CADB possesses better abrupt autofocusing. We
have found a good agreement between the numerical simulations and experimental

(PINNs) for solving systems of partial differential equations admitting
discontinuous solutions. Our method, called Gradient-Annihilated PINNs
(GA-PINNs), introduces a modified loss function that requires the model to
partially ignore high-gradients in the physical variables, achieved by
introducing a suitable weighting function. The method relies on a set of
hyperparameters that control how gradients are treated in the physical loss and
how the activation functions of the neural model are dynamically accounted for.
The performance of our GA-PINN model is demonstrated by solving Riemann
problems in special relativistic hydrodynamics, extending earlier studies with
PINNs in the context of the classical Euler equations. The solutions obtained
with our GA-PINN model correctly describe the propagation speeds of
discontinuities and sharply capture the associated jumps. We use the relative
$l^{2}$ error to compare our results with the exact solution of special
relativistic Riemann problems, used as the reference ``ground truth'', and with
the error obtained with a second-order, central, shock-capturing scheme. In all
problems investigated, the accuracy reached by our GA-PINN model is comparable
to that obtained with a shock-capturing scheme and significantly higher than
that achieved by a baseline PINN algorithm. An additional benefit worth
stressing is that our PINN-based approach sidesteps the costly recovery of the
primitive variables from the state vector of conserved ones, a well-known
drawback of grid-based solutions of the relativistic hydrodynamics equations.
Due to its inherent generality and its ability to handle steep gradients, the
GA-PINN method discussed could be a valuable tool to model relativistic flows
in astrophysics and particle physics, characterized by the prevalence of
discontinuous solutions.

fields, aiming to design novel molecular structures with desired property
profiles. Significant progress has been made by resorting to generative models
for graphs. However, limited attention is paid to hierarchical generative
models, which can exploit the inherent hierarchical structure (with rich
semantic information) of the molecular graphs and generate complex molecules of
larger size that we shall demonstrate to be difficult for most existing models.
The primary challenge to hierarchical generation is the non-differentiable
issue caused by the generation of intermediate discrete coarsened graph
structures. To sidestep this issue, we cast the tricky hierarchical generation
problem over discrete spaces as the reverse process of hierarchical
representation learning and propose MolHF, a new hierarchical flow-based model
that generates molecular graphs in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MolHF
first generates bonds through a multi-scale architecture, then generates atoms
based on the coarsened graph structure at each scale. We demonstrate that MolHF
achieves state-of-the-art performance in random generation and property
optimization, implying its high capacity to model data distribution.
Furthermore, MolHF is the first flow-based model that can be applied to model
larger molecules (polymer) with more than 100 heavy atoms. The code and models

study distributed processes driven by random pairwise interactions of anonymous
agents. The {\em time complexity} of population protocols refers to the number
of interactions required to reach a final configuration. More recently, the
focus is on the {\em parallel time} defined as the time complexity divided by
$n,$ where a given protocol is {\em efficient} if it stabilises in parallel
time $O(\mbox{poly}\log n)$.
  Among computational deficiencies of such protocols are depleting fraction of
{\em meaningful interactions} closing in on the final stabilisation
(suppressing parallel efficiency), computation power of constant-space
population protocols limited to semi-linear predicates in Presburger arithmetic
(reflecting on time-space trade offs), and indefinite computation (impacting
multi-stage protocols). With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a new {\em
selective} variant of population protocols by imposing an elementary structure
on the state space, together with a conditional probabilistic choice during
random interacting pair selection.
  We show that such protocols are capable of computing functions more complex
than semi-linear predicates, i.e., beyond Presburger arithmetic. We provide the
first non-trivial study on median computation (in population protocols) in a
comparison model where the operational state space of agents is fixed and the
transition function decides on the order between (potentially large) hidden
keys associated with the interacting agents. We show that computation of the
median of $n$ numbers requires $\Omega(n)$ parallel time and the problem can be
solved in $O(n\log n)$ parallel time in expectation and whp in standard
population protocols. Finally, we show $O(\log^4 n)$ parallel time median

impressive overall results, the segmentation performance in some hard areas
(e.g., small objects or thin parts) is still not promising. A straightforward
solution is hard sample mining, which is widely used in object detection. Yet,
most existing hard pixel mining strategies for semantic segmentation often rely
on pixel's loss value, which tends to decrease during training. Intuitively,
the pixel hardness for segmentation mainly depends on image structure and is
expected to be stable. In this paper, we propose to learn pixel hardness for
semantic segmentation, leveraging hardness information contained in global and
historical loss values. More precisely, we add a gradient-independent branch
for learning a hardness level (HL) map by maximizing hardness-weighted
segmentation loss, which is minimized for the segmentation head. This
encourages large hardness values in difficult areas, leading to appropriate and
stable HL map. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can be applied to
most segmentation methods with no and marginal extra cost during inference and
training, respectively. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method
achieves consistent/significant improvement (1.37% mIoU on average) over most
popular semantic segmentation methods on Cityscapes dataset, and demonstrates
good generalization ability across domains. The source codes are available at

through mass-transfer in binary/triple systems and stellar collisions. Their
physical and evolutionary properties are largely unknown and unconstrained.
Here we analyze 320 high-resolution spectra of blue stragglers collected in
eight galactic globular clusters with different structural characteristics and
show evidence that the fraction of fast rotating blue stragglers (with
rotational velocities larger than 40 km/s) increases for decreasing central
density of the host system. This trend suggests that fast spinning blue
stragglers prefer low-density environments and promises to open an unexplored
route towards understanding the evolutionary processes of these stars. Since
large rotation rates are expected in the early stages of both formation
channels, our results provide direct evidence for recent blue straggler
formation activity in low-density environments and put strong constraints on
the timescale of the collisional blue straggler slow-down processes.

beautiful geometric description: they are reduced geodesic equations on the
infinite-dimensional Lie group of symplectomorphims with respect to a
right-invariant Riemannian metric. This structure enables insights to Eulerian
and Lagrangian stability via sectional curvature and Jacobi equations.
  The Zeitlin model is a finite-dimensional analog of the 2-D Euler equations;
the only known discretization that preserves the rich geometric structure.
Theoretical and numerical studies indicate that Zeitlin's model provides
consistent long-time behaviour on large scales, but to which extent it truly
reflects the Euler equations is mainly open. Towards progress, we give here two
results. First, convergence of the sectional curvature in the Euler--Zeitlin
equations on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}(N)$ to that of the Euler equations
on the sphere. Second, $L^2$-convergence of the corresponding Jacobi equations
for Lagrangian and Eulerian stability. The results allow geometric conclusions
about Zeitlin's model to be transferred to Euler's equations and vice versa,
which might be central in the ultimate aim: to characterize the generic
long-time behaviour in perfect 2-D fluids.

industry 4.0, task-oriented communication design (TOCD) is getting accelerated
attention from the research community. This paper presents a novel approach for
designing scalable task-oriented quantization and communications in cooperative
multi-agent systems (MAS). The proposed approach utilizes the TOCD framework
and the value of information (VoI) concept to enable efficient communication of
quantized observations among agents while maximizing the average return
performance of the MAS, a parameter that quantifies the MAS's task
effectiveness. The computational complexity of learning the VoI, however, grows
exponentially with the number of agents. Thus, we propose a three-step
framework: i) learning the VoI (using reinforcement learning (RL)) for a
two-agent system, ii) designing the quantization policy for an $N$-agent MAS
using the learned VoI for a range of bit-budgets and, (iii) learning the
agents' control policies using RL while following the designed quantization
policies in the earlier step. We observe that one can reduce the computational
cost of obtaining the value of information by exploiting insights gained from
studying a similar two-agent system - instead of the original $N$-agent system.
We then quantize agents' observations such that their more valuable
observations are communicated more precisely. Our analytical results show the
applicability of the proposed framework under a wide range of problems.
Numerical results show striking improvements in reducing the computational
complexity of obtaining VoI needed for the TOCD in a MAS problem without
compromising the average return performance of the MAS.

for sampling equilibrium states of many-body systems in the canonical ensemble,

Furthermore, BGs can potentially provide a notable improvement in efficiency

Carlo (MC) methods. By sampling from a clustered latent space, BGs can
circumvent free-energy barriers and overcome the rare-event problem. However,
one major limitation of BGs is their inability to sample across phase
transitions between ordered phases. This is due to the fact that new phases may
not be commensurate with the box dimensions, which remain fixed in the
canonical ensemble. In this work, we present a novel BG model for the
isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble, which can successfully overcome this

demonstrate that the samples generated by this model are in good agreement with

resource terms: just like for ordinary Taylor expansion, the dynamics of our
resource calculus allows to simulate the $\beta$-reduction of $\lambda$-terms;
the extensional nature of expansion shows in that we are also able to simulate
$\eta$-reduction.
  In a sense, extensional resource terms form a language of (non-necessarily
normal) finite approximants of Nakajima trees, much like ordinary resource
terms are approximants of B\""ohm-trees. Indeed, we show that the equivalence
induced on $\lambda$-terms by the normalization of extensional Taylor-expansion

Extensional Taylor expansion enjoys similar advantages: e.g., to exhibit models

introduced the Fortet-Mourier and Dudley norms, by embedding the measures into
the dual space of the Banach space of bounded Lipschitz functions, equipped
with different -- but equivalent -- norms: the FM-norm and the BL-nor,
respectively. The norm of such a measure is then obtained by maximising the
value of the measure when applied by integration to extremal functions of the
unit ball. We introduce suitable subsets of extremal functions in both cases,
essentially by a construction by means of McShane's Lipschitz extension
operator for Lipschitz functions on finite metric spaces, that are shown to be
norming. As a consequence, we obtain that these sets are weak-star dense in the
full set of extreme points of the unit ball. If the underlying metric space is
connected, then we have found a larger set of extremal functions for the
BL-norm, similar to such a set that was defined previously by J. Johnson for
the FM-norm when the underlying space was compact. This set is then also
weak-star dense in the extremal functions. This may open an avenue to obtaining
computational approaches for the Dudley norm on signed Borel measures.

For
example, in binary classification, instead of the one-hot target $(1,0)^\top$
used in conventional logistic regression (LR), LR with LS (LSLR) uses the
smoothed target $(1-\frac{\alpha}{2},\frac{\alpha}{2})^\top$ with a smoothing
level $\alpha\in(0,1)$, which causes squeezing of values of the logit. Apart
from the common regularization-based interpretation of LS that leads to an
inconsistent probability estimator, we regard LSLR as modifying the loss
function and consistent estimator for probability estimation. In order to study
the significance of each of these two modifications by LSLR, we introduce a
modified LSLR (MLSLR) that uses the same loss function as LSLR and the same
consistent estimator as LR, while not squeezing the logits. For the loss
function modification, we theoretically show that MLSLR with a larger smoothing
level has lower efficiency with correctly-specified models, while it exhibits
higher robustness against model misspecification than LR. Also, for the
modification of the probability estimator, an experimental comparison between
LSLR and MLSLR showed that this modification and squeezing of the logits in
LSLR have negative effects on the probability estimation and classification
performance. The understanding of the properties of LS provided by these
comparisons allows us to propose MLSLR as an improvement over LSLR.

the other hand, Federated Learning migrates both tasks closer to the edge nodes

preserving the privacy of users. Trained models, though, may under-perform in
dynamic environments due to changes in the data distribution, affecting the
model's ability to infer accurately; this is referred to as concept drift. Such
drift may also be adversarial in nature. Therefore, it is of paramount
importance to detect such behaviours promptly. In order to simultaneously
reduce communication traffic and maintain the integrity of inference models, we
introduce FLARE, a novel lightweight dual-scheduler FL framework that
conditionally transfers training data, and deploys models between edge and
sensor endpoints based on observing the model's training behaviour and
inference statistics, respectively. We show that FLARE can significantly reduce
the amount of data exchanged between edge and sensor nodes compared to
fixed-interval scheduling methods (over 5x reduction), is easily scalable to
larger systems, and can successfully detect concept drift reactively with at

further analysis has revealed the presence of two sub-modes, i.e. the cW mode

for the anomalous mode, a new bright component emerges in the advanced phase
while the bright trailing component in the normal mode disappears. New
observations of PSR B1859+07 by using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical

emission mode, dubbed as the Af mode. In this mode, all emission components
seen in the normal and anomalous modes are detected. Notably, the mean
polarization profiles of both the A and Af modes exhibit an orthogonal
polarization angle jump in the bright leading component. The polarization
angles for the central component in the original normal mode follow two
distinct orthogonal polarization modes in the A and Af modes respectively. The
polarization angles for the trailing component show almost the same but a small

Despite its simplicity, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on

operator algebra or norm interpolation. Instead, our framework considers a
simple information transmission task and obtains lower and upper bounds for it.
The lower bounds are obtained by leveraging a successive cancellation encoding
and decoding technique. Pitting the upper and lower bounds against each other
gives us the desired chain rule. As a demonstration of this technique, we
derive chain rules for the smooth max mutual information and the
smooth-Hypothesis testing mutual information.

semantic visual understanding in a wide range of challenging tasks such as
environmental perception, autonomous navigation, and task planning of
self-driving vehicles and mobile robots. In the process of temporal and spatial
modeling during dynamic scene graph generation, it is particularly intractable
to learn time-variant relations in dynamic scene graphs among frames. In this
paper, we propose a Time-variant Relation-aware TRansformer (TR$^2$), which
aims to model the temporal change of relations in dynamic scene graphs.
Explicitly, we leverage the difference of text embeddings of prompted sentences
about relation labels as the supervision signal for relations. In this way,
cross-modality feature guidance is realized for the learning of time-variant
relations. Implicitly, we design a relation feature fusion module with a
transformer and an additional message token that describes the difference
between adjacent frames. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset
prove that our TR$^2$ can effectively model the time-variant relations. TR$^2$
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods under two different
settings by 2.1% and 2.6% respectively.

the self-similar solution generated at the critical latitude on the librating

shear layer structure and the scaling for its width and velocity amplitude in
$E^{1/3}$ and $E^{1/12}$ respectively are recovered. The amplitude of the
asymptotic solution is shown to decrease to $E^{1/6}$ when it reaches the
attractor, as it is also observed numerically. However, some discrepancies are
observed close to the particular attractors along which the phase of the wave
beam remains constant. Another asymptotic solution close to those attractors is
then constructed using the model of Ogilvie (2005). The solution obtained for
the velocity has an $O(E^{1/6})$ amplitude, but a different self-similar
structure than the critical-latitude solution. It also depends on the Ekman
pumping at the contact points of the attractor with the boundaries. We
demonstrate that it reproduces correctly the numerical solution. Surprisingly,
the solution close to an attractor with phase shift (that is an attractor that
touches the axis in 3D or in 2D with a symmetric forcing) is found to be much

the presence of eavesdropper. Two types of sparse RF chain antenna structures
are adopted, i.e., sub-connected structure and fully connected structure.
Cluster heads are firstly selected for transmissions, and discrete phase-based
analog precoding is designed for the transmit beamforming. Subsequently, based
on the channel conditions, the users are grouped into multiple clusters, and
each cluster is transmitted by using the NOMA technique. In addition, a low
complexity zero-forcing method is employed to design digital precoding so as to
eliminate interference between clusters. On this basis, we propose a secure
transmission scheme to maximize the sum secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the
power allocation and phase shifts of IRS under the constraints of system
transmission power, achievable rate requirement of each user, and IRS phase

non-convex issue. We apply the Taylor series expansion and semidefinite

an alternating optimization algorithm is developed to obtain a feasible

reveal that in the limit of small $\frac{\mu}{\sigma}$, the Markowitz

rules when the expected return is a random normal variable in an average and
worst-case scenarios, which allows us to take into account uncertainty of the

approximates between equal weights and minimum variance portfolio, presenting
an attractive convex alternative to the risk parity portfolio. Utilizing a
microscopic portfolio model with random drift and analytical expression for the
expected utility function with log-normal distributed cross-sectional returns,
we demonstrate the influence of model parameters on portfolio construction.
Finally, we address the issue of handling singular covariance matrices by
imposing block structure constraints on the precision matrix directly. This
comprehensive approach enhances allocation weight stability, mitigates
instabilities associated with the mean-variance approach, and can prove
valuable for both short-term traders and long-term investors.

symmetry, its violation, and energy conservation law on the Poynting vector
field singularities based on the study of resonant scattering of a linearly
polarized plane electromagnetic wave by an infinite right cylinder. The
polarization plane of the incident wave has an arbitrary orientation against
the cylinder axis ($z$-axis), and the wave vector is antiparallel to the
$x$-axis. The angle between the polarization plane and the $z$-axis plays the
role of a bifurcation parameter. We show that any deviation of the incident
wave from the pure TE or TM orientations makes the pattern of the Poynting
vector field lines three-dimensional. Meanwhile, the translational symmetry
along the $z$-axis remains. Accordingly, all singular points of the Poynting
vector field, but the ones lying on the $x$-axis, become ``false''
singularities. They are singular in the projection of the field lines on the
plane $xy$. However, in the three-dimensional space, these points are regular
owing to the finiteness of the Poynting vector $z$-component. In contrast, the
singularities belonging to the $x$-axis remain the actual singular points at
any angle between the $z$-axis and the polarization plane since the
$z$-component of the Poynting vector for them vanishes owing to the problem
symmetry. We study the bifurcations related to the creation (annihilation) of
the false and actual singular points due to their splitting (merger) because of
the bifurcation parameter variations. In all inspected cases, a pitchfork
bifurcation occurs: the distance between the diverging (converging)
singularities as well as the corresponding roots of the characteristic equation
vary as the square root of a normalized deviation of the bifurcation parameter
from its critical value. We present a phenomenological theory, explaining all

indoor scene recognition. Unfortunately, the accuracy of semantic segmentation
has limited the effectiveness of existing approaches for leveraging semantic

auxiliary labeling or co-occurrence statistics, with few exploring the

which starts directly from the semantic information inside the scene.
Specifically, SRRM adopts an adaptive and efficient approach to mitigate the
negative impact of semantic ambiguity and then models the semantic region
relationship to perform scene recognition. Additionally, to more

yet effective sparse self-attention for speech enhancement, called ripple
attention, which simultaneously performs fine- and coarse-grained modeling for
local and global dependencies, respectively. Specifically, we employ local band
attention to enable each frame to attend to its closest neighbor frames in a
window at fine granularity, while employing dilated attention outside the
window to model the global dependencies at a coarse granularity. We evaluate
the efficacy of our ripple attention for speech enhancement on two commonly

  on Tello UAV","plan to submit to IEEE conference",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, with the increasing maturity of UAV technology, the
application of UAV in the civilian field has seen explosive growth due to their
low cost, high flexibility, and wide adaptability. In order to address the
drawbacks of current tethered UAV lighting, which necessitates manual operation
and coordination with tethered cables, this paper presents a rapid reaction and
autonomous deployment emergency lighting system prototype based on Tello UAV.
The system design is divided into three modules. First, the lighting module has
designed the protogype lighting extensions for the Tello UAV. By selecting and
installing LED light sources reasonably, the stability of the UAV's takeoff,
landing, and flight is not affected, while ensuring good lighting effects;
Second, the addressing module extracts the optimization objective function
based on the optimization deployment requirements of UAV, and uses simulated
annealing algorithm to iteratively optimize for different distribution
scenarios and user needs, calculating the optimal deployment location of UAV
and planning flight missions for UAV. Third, the flight control module has
designed a specialized command control framework based on Tello UAV's API,
which converts the planned flight path into command statements, forms flight
text, and controls the flight of unmanned aerial vehicles accordingly. The test
results of the emergency lighting system show that the system can respond
quickly to both densely distributed and sparsely distributed user scenarios,
deploying UAV to the best service locations, and providing high-quality
services to users. This work represents an early attempt of Python-based
real-world UAV lighting system prototype design to associate the UAV hardware
and Python algorithms.

main interest is to confirm if anomalous microwave emission (AME) is present in
M31, as previous studies have suggested. To do so, we built the integrated
spectral energy distribution of M31 between 0.408 and 3000 GHz. We then
performed a component separation analysis taking into account synchrotron,
free-free, AME and thermal dust components. AME in M31 is modelled as a
log-normal distribution with maximum amplitude, $A_{\rm AME}$, equal to
$1.06\pm0.30$ Jy. It peaks at $\nu_{\rm AME}=17.28\pm3.08$ GHz with a width of
$W_{\rm AME}=0.57\pm0.15$. Both the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria
find the model without AME to be less than 1 % as probable as the one taking
AME into consideration, thus strongly favouring the presence of AME in M31. We
find that the AME emissivity in M31 is $\epsilon_{\rm AME}^{\rm

standard formula to calculate these mean values, one obtains both results

spreading the rumor with some probability as a function of their trust in the

probability that a spreader diffuses the rumor decreases over time until they
fully lose their interest and stop spreading.
  We focus on determining the graph parameters which govern the magnitude and
pace that the rumor spreads in this model. We prove that for the rumor to
spread to a sizable fraction of the individuals, the network needs to enjoy
``strong'' expansion properties and most nodes should be in ``well-connected''

thermal transport based on beam-offset frequency-domain thermoreflectance using
a one-dimensional heat source with uniform power distribution. Using a
one-dimensional heat source provides a number of advantages as compared to
point-like heat sources, as typically used in time- and frequency-domain
thermoreflectance experiments, just to name a few: (i) it leads to a slower
spatial decay of the temperature field in the direction perpendicular to the
line-shaped heat source, allowing to probe the temperature field at larger
distances from the heater, hence, enhancing the sensitivity to in-plane thermal
transport; (ii) the frequency range of interest is typically < 100 kHz. This
rather low frequency range is convenient regarding the cost of the required
excitation laser system but, most importantly, it allows the study of materials
without the presence of a metallic transducer with almost no influence of the
finite optical penetration depth of the pump and probe beams on the thermal
phase lag, which arises from the large thermal penetration depth imposed by the
used frequency range. We also show that for the case of a harmonic thermal
excitation source, the phase lag between the thermal excitation and thermal
response of the sample exhibits a linear dependence with their spatial offset,
where the slope is proportional to the inverse of the thermal diffusivity of
the material. We demonstrate the applicability of this method to the cases of:
(i) suspended thin films of Si and PDPP4T, (ii) Bi bulk samples, and (iii) Si,
glass, and highly-oriented pyrollitic graphite (HOPG) bulk samples with a thin
metallic transducer. Finally, we also show that it is possible to study
in-plane heat transport on substrates with rather low thermal diffusivity,
e.g., glass, even using a metallic transducer.

techniques such as Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Greedy algorithms
have been analyzed thoroughly, but they are more suitable when dealing with
linear and affine models showing a fast decay of the Kolmogorov n-width. On one
hand, the autoencoder architecture represents a nonlinear generalization of the
POD compression procedure, allowing one to encode the main information in a
latent set of variables while extracting their main features. On the other
hand, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) constitute a natural framework for studying
PDE solutions defined on unstructured meshes. Here, we develop a non-intrusive
and data-driven nonlinear reduction approach, exploiting GNNs to encode the
reduced manifold and enable fast evaluations of parametrized PDEs. We show the
capabilities of the methodology for several models: linear/nonlinear and
scalar/vector problems with fast/slow decay in the physically and geometrically

While machine learning and optimization have been extensively applied in

combined Bayesian optimization (BO) and individual-based modeling to conduct
design optimizations for maximizing different porous materials' (PM) biofilm
transporation capability. We first characterize the acquisition function in BO
for designing 2-dimensional porous membranes. Results showed that the variance
of the overall samples by the upper confidence bound (UCB) is 32.08% higher
than that of the expected improvement (EI); the mean objective of the overall
samples by the EI is 1.49% higher than that of the UCB. Given the predefined
target region, the EI is 2.35% more efficient than the UCB compared with
uniform grid search. We then use EI for designing lattice metamaterials (LM)
and 3-dimensional porous media (3DPM). It is found that BO is 92.89% more
efficient than the uniform grid search for LM and 223.04% more efficient for
3DPM. The selected characterization simulation tests match well with the
Gaussian process regression approximated design spaces for three cases. We
found that all the extracted optimal designs exhibit better biofilm growth and
transportability than nonconfined vacuum space. Our comparison study shows that
PM stimulates biofilm growth by taking up volumetric space and pushing
biofilms' upward growth, as evidenced by a 20% increase in biofilms in vacuum
space compared to porous materials, and 128% more biofilms in the target growth
region for PM-induced biofilm growth compared with the vacuum space growth. Our
work provides deeper insights into bio-porous materials design, optimization

shocks ion-ion collisions can trigger fusion and fission events at a relatively

specifically, anomalous coupling through plasma microturbulence, that can
significantly reduce the velocity spread downstream, below the activation

Modular symmetry reduces the usage of flavon fields compared to the

these models can be tested in future neutrino experiments. In this study, we
consider three models based on the $A_4$ modular symmetry, i.e., Model-A, B,

it is expected that T2HK, DUNE, and JUNO will measure the neutrino oscillation

Hermitian BBC with conventional boundary modes. In this work, we go beyond the
known description of the non-Hermitian topological phase by discovering a new
type of BBC that appears in generalized boundary conditions. The generalized
Brillouin zone (GBZ) possesses non-trivial topological structures in the
intermediate boundary condition between open and periodic boundary conditions.
Unlike the conventional BBC, the topological phase transition is characterized
by the generalized momentum touching of GBZ, which manifests as exceptional
points. As a realization of our proposal, we suggest the non-reciprocal
Kuramoto oscillator lattice, where the phase slips accompany the exceptional
points as a signature of such topological phase transition. Our work
establishes an understanding of non-Hermitian topological matter by
complementing the non-Hermitian BBC as a general foundation of the

shallow 3D convolution networks suffer the Moir\'e artifacts, but deep 3D
convolutions cause over-smoothness. We analyze the fundamental difference
between demosaicking and other problems that predict lost pixels between

underlying reasons for the confliction between Moir\'e-free and
detail-preserving. From the new perspective, our work decouples the common
standard convolution procedure to spectral and spatial feature aggregations,
which allow strengthening global communication in the spectral dimension while
respecting local contrast in the spatial dimension. We apply our demosaicking
model to two tasks: Joint Demosaicking-Denoising and Independently

crucial area for recommendation re-search as it involves rigid aspects of

empirically find that when existing GCN-based CF methods are directly applied
to e-government service recommendation, they are limited by the MF framework

high-order collaborative signals obtained from multi-layer light graph

electron-positron annihilation event reflects the momentum density of
annihilating pairs and local electron momenta at positron annihilation sites.
It can provide information on the chemical surroundings of vacancies, such as
the impurity atoms around them. Accurate methods based on first-principles
calculations are crucial for interpreting measured Doppler spectra. In this
work we will validate such a method based on variational quantum Monte Carlo by
benchmarking results in aluminium nitride and silicon against experimental data
measured from defect-free reference samples. The method directly models
electron-positron correlations using variational wave functions. We achieve
better agreement with experiments for our test set than conventional

terms of security, privacy, efficiency, cost, and more. In this paper, we
provide a detailed survey of existing works on the application of blockchain
and AI to 6G wireless communications. More specifically, we start with a brief
overview of blockchain and AI. Then, we mainly review the recent advances in
the fusion of blockchain and AI, and highlight the inevitable trend of
deploying both blockchain and AI in wireless communications. Furthermore, we
extensively explore integrating blockchain and AI for wireless communication
systems, involving secure services and Internet of Things (IoT) smart
applications. Particularly, some of the most talked-about key services based on
blockchain and AI are introduced, such as spectrum management, computation
allocation, content caching, and security and privacy. Moreover, we also focus
on some important IoT smart applications supported by blockchain and AI,
covering smart healthcare, smart transportation, smart grid, and unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs). We also analyze the open issues and research challenges
for the joint deployment of blockchain and AI in 6G wireless communications.
Lastly, based on lots of existing meaningful works, this paper aims to provide

properties of exoplanets. We explore the impact of one simplifying assumption
commonly employed by forward models of transiting exoplanets: namely that the
planet can be treated as an isolated, non-rotating spherical body. The
centrifugal acceleration due to a planet's rotation opposes the gravitational
pull on a planet's atmosphere and increases its scale height. Conventional
forward models used for retrievals generally do not include this effect. We
find that atmospheric retrievals produce significantly different results for
close-in planets with low gravity when this assumption is removed, e.g.,
differences between true and retrieved values of gas abundances greater than
1$\sigma$ for a simulated planet analogous to WASP-19 b. We recommend that the
correction to the atmospheric scale height due to this effect be taken into
account for the analysis of high precision transmission spectra of exoplanets

example nevertheless demonstrates very rich behavior which still lacks a

  breaking onset",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Deep-water surface wave breaking affects the transfer of mass, momentum,
energy and heat between the air and sea. Understanding when and how the onset
of wave breaking will occur remains a challenge. The mechanisms that form steep
waves, i.e. nonlinearity or dispersion, are thought to have a strong influence
on the onset of wave breaking. In two-dimensions and on deep-water, spectral
bandwidth is the main factor that affects the roles these mechanism play.
Existing studies, in which the relationship between spectral bandwidth and wave
breaking onset is investigated, present varied and sometimes conflicting
results. We perform numerical simulations of two-dimensional focused wave
groups on deep-water to better understand this relationship, with the aim
reconciling existing studies. We show that the way in which steepness is
defined, may be the main source confusion in the literature. At breaking onset,
locally defined steepness reduces as a function of bandwidth, and globally
defined steepness increases. The relationship between global breaking onset
steepness and spectral shape (using the parameters bandwidth and spectral
skewness) is too complex to parameterise in a general sense. However, we find
that the local surface slope of maximally steep non breaking waves, of all
spectral bandwidths and shapes (constant-steepness, constant-amplitude, and
JONSWAP), approaches a limit of $1/\tan(\pi/3)\approx0.5774$. This slope based
threshold, is simple to measure and may be used as an alternative to existing
kinematic breaking onset thresholds. There is a potential link between slope
based and kinematic breaking onset thresholds which future work should seek to
better understand.

compact objects (DCOs): black hole - black hole (BH-BH), black hole - neutron
star (BH-NS), or neutron star - neutron star (NS-NS) systems. The connection
(i.e. XRBs evolving into DCOs) may provide some hints to the yet unanswered
question: what is the origin of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA mergers? Available
observations do not allow to determine what will be the final fate of the XRBs
observed in M83. Yet, we can use evolutionary model of isolated binaries to
reproduce the population of XRBs in M83 by matching model XRBs
numbers/types/luminosities to observations. Knowing the detailed properties of
M83 model XRBs (donor/accretor masses, their evolutionary ages and orbits) we
follow their evolution to the death of donor stars to check whether any merging
DCOs are formed. Although all merging DCOs in our isolated binary evolution
model go through the XRB phase (defined as reaching X-ray luminosity from
RLOF/wind accretion onto NS/BH above $10^{35}$ erg/s), only very few XRBs
evolve to form merging (in Hubble time) DCOs. For M83 with its solar-like
metallicity stars and continiuous star-formation we find that only $\sim 1-2\%$
of model XRBs evolve into merging DCOs depending on the adopted evolutionary
physics. This is caused by (i) merger of donor star with compact object during
common envelope phase, (ii) binary disruption at the supernova explosion of
donor star, (iii) formation of a DCO on a wide orbit (merger time longer than
Hubble time).

that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of
freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial
state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated
by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset
times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset
operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix
Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the
preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis
considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different
reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is
essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset
time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we
provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to
the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows
remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise.
Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer
advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and
quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.

  Perspective of Radiation Mechanisms","14 pages, 12 figures, 1 table. Submitted to MNRAS. Comments welcome!!",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The extremely high brightness temperatures of fast radio bursts (FRBs) imply
that the radiation process must be coherent, but the radiation mechanism is
still unknown. The observed properties of narrow spectra and polarization
distributions could be used to constrain the radiation mechanism of FRBs. In
this work, we discuss the implications of the spectra and polarizations of FRBs
from the perspective of intrinsic radiation mechanisms. We first analyze the
observed relative spectral bandwidth of radio bursts from an FRB repeater.
Furthermore, we generally discuss the properties of the spectra and
polarization of the radiation mechanisms involving the relativistic particle's
perpendicular acceleration, which depends on the relation between the
particle's deflection angle $\psi$ and the radiation beaming angle $1/\gamma$.
We find that: (1) If the narrow spectra of FRBs are attributed to the intrinsic
radiation mechanism of a single particle, the condition of $\gamma\psi\ll1$
would be necessary, in which scenario, the observed number fraction between
linearly and circularly polarized bursts of some FRB repeaters might be due to
the propagation effects; (2) Coherent process by multiple particles with some
special distributions can lead to a narrow spectrum even for the scenario with
$\gamma\psi\gg1$; (3) If the observed number fraction between linearly and
circularly polarized bursts is attributed to the radiation mechanism with
$\gamma\psi\gg1$, the cumulative distributions of the linear and circular
polarization degrees would mainly depend on the particle's beaming
distribution.

Sentence Representation Learning (USRL). However, PLMs are sensitive to the
frequency information of words from their pre-training corpora, resulting in
anisotropic embedding space, where the embeddings of high-frequency words are
clustered but those of low-frequency words disperse sparsely. This anisotropic
phenomenon results in two problems of similarity bias and information bias,
lowering the quality of sentence embeddings. To solve the problems, we
fine-tune PLMs by leveraging the frequency information of words and propose a
novel USRL framework, namely Sentence Representation Learning with
Frequency-induced Adversarial tuning and Incomplete sentence filtering
(SLT-FAI). We calculate the word frequencies over the pre-training corpora of
PLMs and assign words thresholding frequency labels. With them, (1) we
incorporate a similarity discriminator used to distinguish the embeddings of
high-frequency and low-frequency words, and adversarially tune the PLM with it,
enabling to achieve uniformly frequency-invariant embedding space; and (2) we
propose a novel incomplete sentence detection task, where we incorporate an
information discriminator to distinguish the embeddings of original sentences
and incomplete sentences by randomly masking several low-frequency words,
enabling to emphasize the more informative low-frequency words. Our SLT-FAI is
a flexible and plug-and-play framework, and it can be integrated with existing
USRL techniques. We evaluate SLT-FAI with various backbones on benchmark
datasets. Empirical results indicate that SLT-FAI can be superior to the
existing USRL baselines. Our code is released in

can be solved completely mode by mode for each spatial wave number, and their
longtime dynamics is intimately tied to the ``survival threshold'' of wave
numbers computed by $$\kappa_0^2 = 4\pi \int_0^\Upsilon \frac{u^2\mu(\frac12
u^2)}{\Upsilon^2-u^2} \;du$$ where $\Upsilon$ is the maximal speed of particle
velocities. It is shown that purely oscillatory electric fields exist and obey
a Klein-Gordon's type dispersion relation for wave numbers below the threshold,
thus confirming the existence of Langmuir's oscillatory waves known in the
physical literature. At the threshold, the phase velocity of these oscillatory
waves enters the range of admissible particle velocities, namely there are
particles that move at the same propagation speed of the waves. It is this
exact resonant interaction between particles and the oscillatory fields that
causes the waves to be damped, classically known as Landau damping. Landau's
law of decay is explicitly computed and is sensitive to the decaying rate of
the background equilibria. The faster it decays at the maximal velocity, the
weaker Landau damping is. Beyond the threshold, the electric fields are a
perturbation of those generated by the free transport dynamics and thus decay
rapidly fast due to the phase mixing mechanism.

that a simple CLIP baseline can also be improved substantially, up to a 25%

training techniques that are popular in other subfields. Moreover, we discover
that it is enough to apply image and text augmentations to make up for most of

the Lorentz violation is produced by a modification of the Majorana equation

the same violation of Lorentz symmetry for the Majorana field and adjust the

of this bottom-up approach it is then possible to construct conserved

  Framework","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security
  (IEEE TIFS)",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the limited battery and computing resource, offloading unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs)' computation tasks to ground infrastructure, e.g., vehicles, is
a fundamental framework. Under such an open and untrusted environment, vehicles
are reluctant to share their computing resource unless provisioning strong
incentives, privacy protection, and fairness guarantee. Precisely, without
strategy-proofness guarantee, the strategic vehicles can overclaim
participation costs so as to conduct market manipulation. Without the fairness
provision, vehicles can deliberately abort the assigned tasks without any
punishments, and UAVs can refuse to pay by the end, causing an exchange
dilemma. Lastly, the strategy-proofness and fairness provision typically
require transparent payment/task results exchange under public audit, which may
disclose sensitive information of vehicles and make the privacy preservation a
foremost issue. To achieve the three design goals, we propose SEAL, an
integrated framework to address strategy-proof, fair, and privacy-preserving
UAV computation offloading. SEAL deploys a strategy-proof reverse combinatorial
auction mechanism to optimize UAVs' task offloading under practical constraints
while ensuring economic-robustness and polynomial-time efficiency. Based on
smart contracts and hashchain micropayment, SEAL implements a fair on-chain
exchange protocol to realize the atomic completion of batch payments and
computing results in multi-round auctions. In addition, a privacy-preserving
off-chain auction protocol is devised with the assistance of the trusted
processor to efficiently protect vehicles' bid privacy. Using rigorous
theoretical analysis and extensive simulations, we validate that SEAL can
effectively prevent vehicles from manipulating, ensure privacy protection and
fairness, improve the offloading efficiency.

the qubit relaxes exponentially towards its zero-temperature state at a well
characterized rate. Second, the bath spins, even when mutually coupled, do not
relax towards a thermal distribution, but rather form a Lorentzian distribution

captured by an analytical approximation that makes use of the property $N\gg 1$

state-of-the-art studies in MMKC only consider entity and relation extraction

current continual setting for knowledge graph construction only consider entity

continuous multimodal knowledge graph construction to address the phenomenon of
catastrophic forgetting and ensure the retention of past knowledge extracted

complex topic by developing lifelong multimodal benchmark datasets. Based on
the empirical findings that several state-of-the-art MMKC models, when trained

the modality gap is relatively small during training except for some difficult

predictions of ST and MT, whose target-side contexts are derived by sampling
between ground truth words and self-generated words with a varying probability.
Furthermore, we introduce token-level adaptive training which assigns different

semi-adiabatic SPECIAL sequence with a stimulated echo (STE) diffusion block.
Acquisitions with DW-SPECIAL and STE-LASER, the current gold-standard for
rodent DWS experiments at high fields, were performed at 14.1T on phantoms and
in vivo on the rat brain. The apparent diffusion coefficient and intra-stick
diffusivity (Callaghan's model) were fitted and compared between the sequences
for glutamate, glutamine (Gln), myo-inositol, taurine, total N-acetylaspartate,
total choline, total creatine and the macromolecules. The shorter echo time
achieved with DW-SPECIAL (18 ms against 33 ms with STE-LASER) substantially
limited the metabolites' signal loss caused by J-evolution. In addition,
DW-SPECIAL preserved the main advantages of STE-LASER: absence of cross-terms,
diffusion time during a STE and limited sensitivity to B1 inhomogeneities. In
vivo, compared to STE-LASER, DW-SPECIAL yielded the same spectral quality and
reduced the Cramer Rao Lower Bounds (CRLB) for J-coupled metabolites,
irrespective of the b-value. DW-SPECIAL also reduced the standard deviation of
the metabolites' diffusion estimates based on individual animal fitting without
loss of accuracy compared to the fit on the averaged decay. We conclude that
due to its reduced echo time, DW-SPECIAL can serve as an alternative to
STE-LASER when strongly J-coupled metabolites like Gln are investigated,
thereby extending the range of accessible metabolites in the context of DWS

  air showers at large zenith angles",,,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The detailed simulation of extended air showers (EAS) and their emission of
Cherenkov and fluorescence light requires increasing computation time and
storage volume with increasing energy of the primary particle. Given these
limitations, it is currently challenging to optimize configurations of imaging
air Cherenkov telescopes at photon energies beyond approximately 100 TeV.
Additionally, the existing simulation frameworks are not capable of capturing
the interplay of Cherenkov and fluorescence light emission at large zenith
angle distances ($\gtrsim 70^\circ$), where the collection area of Cherenkov
telescopes considerably increases. Here, we present EASpy, a framework for the
simulation of EAS at large zenith angles using parametrizations for
electron-positron distributions. Our proposed approach for the emission of
fluorescence and Cherenkov light and the subsequent imaging of these components
by Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) aims to provide flexibility
and accuracy while at the same time it reduces the computation time
considerably compared to full Monte Carlo simulations. We find excellent
agreement of the resulting Cherenkov images when comparing results obtained
from EASpy with the de-facto standard simulation tool CORSIKA and sim_telarray.
In the process of verifying our approach, we have found that air shower images
appear wider and longer with increasing impact distance at large zenith angles,
an effect that has previously not been noted. We also investigate the
distribution of light on the ground for fluorescence and Cherenkov emission and
highlight their key differences to distributions at moderate zenith angles.

several representative Large Language Models (LLMs) and a widely-utilized

This observation underscores the fact that even the highly performance GPT-4

results questionable. In light of these findings, we conclude by proposing
potential research trajectories to further enhance the development and

developed by Blossey et al., which takes into account the structural
interactions between ions through a bilinear form over the gradients of local
ionic concentrations in the grand thermodynamic potential, as well as their
steric interactions through the lattice gas model. The structural interactions
may describe effects of the molecular structure of ions at a phenomenological
level. For example, these effects include steric effects due to non-spherical
shapes of ions, their conformation lability, and solvent effects. In addition,
we explore their specific interactions with the pore walls by incorporating
external attractive potentials. Our primary focus is on observing the behavior
of ionic concentration profiles and the disjoining pressure as the pore width
changes. By starting with the local mechanical equilibrium condition, we derive
a general expression for the disjoining pressure. Our findings indicate that
considering the structural interactions of ions leads to a pronounced minimum
on the disjoining pressure profiles at small pore widths. We attribute this
minimum to the formation of electric double layers on the electrified surfaces
of the pore. Additionally, our results demonstrate that inclusion of the
attractive interactions of ions with the pore walls enhances this minimum and
shifts it to smaller pore thicknesses. Our theoretical discoveries may be
useful for those involved in supercapacitor electrochemical engineering,

to the case when mixing is absent, the antiparticle sector contribution cannot
be neglected for particles with definite flavor. To clearly demonstrate this

Furthermore, within the same framework, we also demonstrate that, in the

gravity (gravitational mass) does not match the effective inertial mass. This,
in turn, implies a violation of the weak equivalence principle. Finally, we
prove that the Bargmann's superselection rule, which prohibits oscillating

non-relativistic limit of the Lorentz transformation and hence does not collide

suitable compactness condition, the maximal domains of meromorphic continuation
of the initial density-density response function and the solution of the Dyson
equation are the same. The results derived here apply to widely used adiabatic

these results show that neither of these approximations can shift the

several works have attempted to integrate external knowledge into PLMs.
However, despite the promising outcome, we empirically observe that PLMs may
have already encoded rich knowledge in their pre-trained parameters but fails
to fully utilize them when applying to knowledge-intensive tasks. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm dubbed Knowledge Rumination to help the
pre-trained language model utilize those related latent knowledge without
retrieving them from the external corpus. By simply adding a prompt like ``As
far as I know'' to the PLMs, we try to review related latent knowledge and
inject them back to the model for knowledge consolidation. We apply the
proposed knowledge rumination to various language models, including RoBERTa,
DeBERTa, GPT-3 and OPT. Experimental results on six commonsense reasoning tasks
and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach,
which further proves that the knowledge stored in PLMs can be better exploited

  Statistics",,,,,"cs.LG physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present an iterative framework to improve the amortized approximations of
posterior distributions in the context of Bayesian inverse problems, which is
inspired by loop-unrolled gradient descent methods and is theoretically
grounded in maximally informative summary statistics. Amortized variational
inference is restricted by the expressive power of the chosen variational
distribution and the availability of training data in the form of joint data
and parameter samples, which often lead to approximation errors such as the
amortization gap. To address this issue, we propose an iterative framework that
refines the current amortized posterior approximation at each step. Our
approach involves alternating between two steps: (1) constructing a training
dataset consisting of pairs of summarized data residuals and parameters, where
the summarized data residual is generated using a gradient-based summary
statistic, and (2) training a conditional generative model -- a normalizing
flow in our examples -- on this dataset to obtain a probabilistic update of the
unknown parameter. This procedure leads to iterative refinement of the
amortized posterior approximations without the need for extra training data. We
validate our method in a controlled setting by applying it to a stylized
problem, and observe improved posterior approximations with each iteration.
Additionally, we showcase the capability of our method in tackling
realistically sized problems by applying it to transcranial ultrasound, a
high-dimensional, nonlinear inverse problem governed by wave physics, and
observe enhanced posterior quality through better image reconstruction with the
posterior mean.

frequently applied to improve the final estimate of shear wave speed and shear
modulus of tissues. The vector curl operator can separate out the transverse
component of a complicated displacement field, and directional filters can
separate distinct orientations of wave propagation. However, there are
practical limitations that can prevent the intended improvement in elastography
estimates. Some simple configurations of wavefields relevant to elastography
are examined against theoretical models within the semi-infinite elastic medium
and guided waves in a bounded medium. The Miller-Pursey solutions in simplified
form are examined for the semi-infinite medium and the Lamb wave symmetric form
is considered for the guided wave structure. In both cases, wave combinations
along with practical limits on the imaging plane can prevent the curl and
directional filter operations from directly providing an improved measure of
shear wave speed and shear modulus. Additional limits on signal-to-noise and
the support of filters also restrict the applica-bility of these strategies for
improving elastographic measures. Practical implementations of shear wave
excitations applied to the body and to bounded structures within the body can
involve waves that are not easily resolved by the vector curl operator and
directional filters. These limits may be overcome by more advanced strategies
or simple improvements in baseline parameters including the size of the region
of interest and the number of shear waves propagated within.

Prediction model is used to help understand the characteristics of regional

preserve the weight matrix for geological and attribute distance functions.
Results show that the house attributes/conditions and the characteristics of

challenges of data valuation lie, both for practitioners and for academic
researchers. Considerations on the methods applicable to take advantage of the
possibilities offered by these massive data are relatively recent, and often

adapted to process time series, performing tasks such as nonlinear distortion
compensation or prediction of chaotic dynamics. Deep reservoir computers
(deep-RC), in which the output of one reservoir is used as input of the next
reservoir, can lead to improved performance because, as in other deep
artificial neural networks, the successive layers represent the data in more
and more abstract ways. We present a fiber-based photonic implementation of a
two-layer deep-RC based on frequency multiplexing. The two RC layers are
encoded in two frequency combs propagating in the same experimental setup. The
connection between layers is fully analog and does not require any digital
processing. We find that the deep-RC outperforms traditional RC by up to two
orders of magnitude on two benchmark tasks. This work thus paves the way
towards using fully analog photonic neuromorphic computing for complex
processing of time series, while avoiding costly analog-to-digital and
digital-to-analog conversions.

directions in the Brillouin zone, the dynamical excitations in two-dimensional
attractive Fermi-Hubbard model are studied based on the random-phase
approximation. At the small transfer momentum, the sound speed can be obtained
and is suppressed by the interaction strength. In particular, at the transfer
momentum ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$, the dynamical structure factor
consists of a sharp bosonic molecular excitation peak in the low-energy region
and a broad atomic excitation band in the higher energy region. Furthermore, as
the hopping strength increases (the interaction strength decreases), the weight
of the molecular excitation peak decreases monotonically while the weight of
the atomic excitations increases quickly. The area of the molecular excitation
peak scales with the square of the pairing gap, which also applies to the
spin-orbit coupling case. These theoretical results show that the pairing gap
in optical lattice can be obtained experimentally by measuring the dynamical
structure factor at ${\bf q}=\left[\pi,\pi\right]$.

  Consistency, and Credibility",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent popularity of large language models (LLMs) has brought a
significant impact to boundless fields, particularly through their open-ended
ecosystem such as the APIs, open-sourced models, and plugins. However, with
their widespread deployment, there is a general lack of research that
thoroughly discusses and analyzes the potential risks concealed. In that case,
we intend to conduct a preliminary but pioneering study covering the
robustness, consistency, and credibility of LLMs systems. With most of the
related literature in the era of LLM uncharted, we propose an automated
workflow that copes with an upscaled number of queries/responses. Overall, we
conduct over a million queries to the mainstream LLMs including ChatGPT, LLaMA,
and OPT. Core to our workflow consists of a data primitive, followed by an
automated interpreter that evaluates these LLMs under different adversarial
metrical systems. As a result, we draw several, and perhaps unfortunate,
conclusions that are quite uncommon from this trendy community. Briefly, they
are: (i)-the minor but inevitable error occurrence in the user-generated query
input may, by chance, cause the LLM to respond unexpectedly; (ii)-LLMs possess
poor consistency when processing semantically similar query input. In addition,
as a side finding, we find that ChatGPT is still capable to yield the correct
answer even when the input is polluted at an extreme level. While this
phenomenon demonstrates the powerful memorization of the LLMs, it raises
serious concerns about using such data for LLM-involved evaluation in academic
development. To deal with it, we propose a novel index associated with a
dataset that roughly decides the feasibility of using such data for
LLM-involved evaluation. Extensive empirical studies are tagged to support the
aforementioned claims.

found at redshifts 6-7.5, when the universe was less than 1 Gyr old. The
existence of such supermassive black holes already in place at such early
epochs has been challenging for theoretical models and distinguishing between
different scenarios has prompted the search for their progenitors at earlier
epochs. Here we present an extensive analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum
(from the JADES survey) of GN-z11, an exceptionally luminous galaxy at z=10.6,
revealing the detection of the high ionization [NeIV]$\lambda$2423 transition
and semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than $\rm
10^{10}~cm^{-3}$, typical of the Broad Line Region of Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN). These spectral features indicate that, in addition to star formation,
GN-z11 also hosts an accreting black hole. We do not exclude a contribution
from extreme stellar populations, however Wolf Rayet stars alone cannot account
for many of the spectral properties. The spectrum also reveals a deep and
blueshifted CIV$\lambda$1549 absorption trough, tracing an outflow with a
velocity of $\sim 800-1000$ km/s, higher than typically observed in starburst
galaxies, hence likely driven by the AGN. Assuming local virial scaling
relations, we derive a black hole mass of $\rm \log{(M_{BH}/M_{\odot})}=6.2\pm
0.3$, accreting at about 5 times the Eddington rate. While super-Eddington
accretion is probably episodic, if it has been occurring for the previous $\sim
100$ Myr, then the black hole could have potentially originated even from a
stellar mass seed at z$\sim$12-15. We finally discuss that our finding
naturally explains the high luminosity of GN-z11 and can also provide an
explanation for its exceptionally high nitrogen abundance.

contrastive and non-contrastive nasality in French and English vowels by
applying the ciwGAN architecture (Begus 2021a). Begus claims that ciwGAN
encodes linguistically meaningful representations with categorical variables in
its latent space and manipulating the latent variables shows an almost one to
one corresponding control of the phonological features in ciwGAN's generated

the features in the generated outputs, which suggests the learned
representations in neural networks are different from the phonological
representations proposed by linguists. On the other hand, ciwGAN is able to
distinguish contrastive and noncontrastive features in English and French by
encoding them differently. Comparing the performance of GANs learning from

of newly discovered high-z AGNs, more than 10 at z > 4, we wonder: are we
really surprised to find them in the nuclei of z = 5 - 11 galaxies? Can we use
the estimated properties to trace their origin? In this work, we predict the
properties of 4 < z < 11 BHs and their host galaxies considering an
Eddington-limited (EL) and a super-Eddington (SE) BH accretion scenario, using
the Cosmic Archaeology Tool (CAT), a semi-analytical model for the formation
and evolution of z > 4 AGNs and galaxies. We then calculate the transmitted
spectral energy distribution of CAT synthetic candidates, representative of the
estimated BH properties in CEERS-1019 and GNz11. We find that the estimated
luminosity of high-z JWST detected AGNs are better reproduced by the SE model,
where BHs descend from efficiently growing light and heavy seeds. Conversely,
the host galaxy stellar masses are better matched in the EL model, in which all
the systems detectable with JWST surveys JADES and CEERS appear to be
descendants of heavy BH seeds. Our study suggests an evolutionary connection
between systems similar to GNz11 at z=10.6 and CEERS-1019 at z=8.7 and supports
the interpretation that the central point source of GNz11 could be powered by a

sub-Eddington (lambda_Edd = 0.45 - 1), with a dominant emission from the host

the dendrites, this task is also very challenging. Different from the typical
detection problems in the computer vision field, detecting the dendrite core
aims to detect a single point location instead of the bounding-box. As a
result, the existing regressing bounding-box based detection methods can not
work well on this task because the calculated center point location based on
the upper-left and lower-right corners of the bounding-box is usually not

Plasma turbulence is primarily shaped by the forcing on large scales and
damping on small scales. Based on an improved compressible MHD decomposition
algorithm, our observations demonstrate that CD enhances the anisotropy of
compressible MHD modes due to their strong pitch angle dependence. The
wavenumber distributions of slow modes are more stretched perpendicular to the
background magnetic field ($\mathbf{B_0}$) under CD modulation compared to
Alfv\'en modes. In contrast, fast modes are subject to a more significant CD
modulation. Fast modes exhibit a scale-independent, slight anisotropy above the
CD truncation scales, and their anisotropy increases as the wavenumbers fall
below the CD truncation scales. As a result, CD affects the relative energy
fractions in total compressible modes. Our findings take a significant step
forward in comprehending the functions of CD in truncating the compressible MHD
turbulence cascade and the consequential energy anisotropy in the wavevector

position space. The edge modes are weakly confined to the edge, featuring
dispersion which is robust and insensitive to the detailed profile of
magnetization at the edge. This unique character of edge modes reduces their
overlap with edge disorder and enhances the mode lifetime. The mode propagation
direction reverses upon reversing valley polarization, an effect that provides

  measures on the path space",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating high-fidelity time series data using generative adversarial
networks (GANs) remains a challenging task, as it is difficult to capture the
temporal dependence of joint probability distributions induced by time-series
data. Towards this goal, a key step is the development of an effective
discriminator to distinguish between time series distributions. We propose the
so-called PCF-GAN, a novel GAN that incorporates the path characteristic
function (PCF) as the principled representation of time series distribution
into the discriminator to enhance its generative performance. On the one hand,
we establish theoretical foundations of the PCF distance by proving its
characteristicity, boundedness, differentiability with respect to generator
parameters, and weak continuity, which ensure the stability and feasibility of
training the PCF-GAN. On the other hand, we design efficient initialisation and
optimisation schemes for PCFs to strengthen the discriminative power and
accelerate training efficiency. To further boost the capabilities of complex
time series generation, we integrate the auto-encoder structure via sequential
embedding into the PCF-GAN, which provides additional reconstruction
functionality. Extensive numerical experiments on various datasets demonstrate
the consistently superior performance of PCF-GAN over state-of-the-art
baselines, in both generation and reconstruction quality. Code is available at

The results show that the polarizations of gravitational waves depend on the

the $+$ and $\times$ modes. In some parameter space, besides tensor modes, it
also allows one scalar mode, or two vector (vector-$x$ and vector-$y$) modes,
or both one scalar mode and two vector modes. The scalar mode is a mixture mode
of a breathing mode and a longitudinal mode, or just a pure breathing mode.
Interestingly, it is found that the amplitude of the vector modes is related to
the speed of the tensor modes. This allows us to give the upper bound of the
amplitude of the vector modes by detecting the speed of the tensor modes.
Specifically, if the speed of tensor modes is strictly equal to the speed of
light, then the amplitude of vector modes is zero.

where ISAC transmit access points (APs) jointly serve the user equipments (UEs)
and optionally steer a beam toward the target. A centralized operation of
cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is considered for
communication and sensing purposes. A maximum a posteriori ratio test detector
is developed to detect the target in the presence of clutter, so-called
target-free signals. Moreover, a power allocation algorithm is proposed to
maximize the sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) while
ensuring a minimum communication SINR value for each UE and meeting per-AP
power constraints. Two ISAC setups are studied: i) using only existing
communication beams for sensing and ii) using additional sensing beams. The
proposed algorithm's efficiency is investigated in both realistic and
idealistic scenarios, corresponding to the presence and absence of the
target-free channels, respectively. Although detection probability degrades in
the presence of target-free channels that act as interference, the proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms the interference-unaware benchmark by
exploiting the statistics of the clutter. It has also been shown that the
proposed algorithm outperforms the fully communication-centric algorithm, both
in the presence and absence of clutter. Moreover, using an additional sensing
beam improves the detection performance for a target with lower radar
cross-section variances compared to the case without sensing beams.

most powerful episode that drives black hole growth, and it may work in several
types of objects. However, the physics of accretion and jet-disc coupling in
such a state remains unclear, mainly because the associated jets are not easily
detectable due to the extremely weak emission or possibly episodic nature of
the jets. Only a few near/super-Eddington systems have demonstrated radio
activity, and it remains unclear whether there is a jet and what are their
properties, in super-Eddington active galactic nuclei (AGNs) (and ultraluminous
X-ray sources). The deficit is mainly due to the complex radio mixing between
the origins of jets and others, such as star formation activity, photo-ionized
gas, accretion disk wind, and coronal activity. In this work, we conducted
high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to
explore the jets in the highly accreting narrow-line Seyfert I system IZw1. Our
observations successfully revealed small-scale jets (with a linear size of
$\sim45$ parsec) at both 1.5 and 5 GHz, based on the high radio brightness
temperature, radio morphology, and spectral index distribution. Interestingly,
the lack of a flat-spectrum radio core and knotty jet structures imply episodic
ejections in IZw1, which resemble the ejection process in Galactic X-ray
binaries that are in the canonical very high state. The high accretion rates
and jet properties in the AGN IZw1 may support the AGN/XRB analogy in the
extreme state.

of the starburst galaxy NGC 3628. The VLBI observation at 1.5 GHz reveals seven
compact (0.7$-$7 parsec) radio sources in the central $\sim$250 parsec region
of NGC 3628. Based on their morphology, high radio brightness temperatures
($10^5-10^7$ K), and steep radio spectra, none of these seven sources can be
associated with active galactic nuclei (AGNs); instead, they can be identified
as supernova remnants (SNRs), with three of them appearing consistent with
partial shells. Notably, one of them (W2) is likely a nascent radio supernova
and appears to be consistent with the star formation rate of NGC 3628 when
assuming a canonical initial mass function. The VLBI observation provides the
first precise measurement of the diameter of the radio sources in NGC 3628,
which allow us to fit a well-constrained radio surface brightness - diameter
($\Sigma-D$) correlation by including the detected SNRs. Furthermore, future
VLBI observations can be conducted to measure the expansion velocity of the
detected SNRs. In addition to our radio VLBI study, we analyze Chandra and
XMM-Newton spectra of NGC 3628. The spectral fitting indicates that the SNR
activities could well account for the observed X-ray emissions. Along with the
Chandra X-ray image, it further reveals that the X-ray emission is likely
maintained by the galactic-scale outflow triggered by SN activities. These
results provide strong evidence that SN-triggered activities play a critical
role in generating both radio and X-ray emissions in NGC 3628 and further
suggest that the galaxy NGC 3628 is in an early stage of starbursts.

for accretion and ejection processes. The radio band survey of IMBH (candidate)
hosted galaxies indicates that only a small fraction ($\sim$0.6\%) of them are
radio-band active. In addition, very long baseline interferometry observations
reveal parsec-scale radio emission of IMBHs, further resulting in a lower
fraction of actively ejecting objects (radio emission is produced by IMBHs
other than hosts), which is consistent with a long quiescent state in the
evolution cycle of IMBHs. Most (75\%, i.e., 3 out of 4 samples according to a
recent mini-survey) of the radio-emitting IMBHs are associated with radio
relics and there is also evidence of dual radio blobs from episodic ejecting
phases. Taking the radio emission and the corresponding core X-ray emission of
IMBH, we confirm a universal fundamental plane relation (FMP) of black hole
activity. Furthermore, state transitions can be inferred by comparing a few
cases in XRBs and IMBHs in FMP, i.e., both radio luminosity and emission
regions evolve along these state transitions. These signatures and evidence
suggest an analogy among all kinds of accretion systems which span from stellar
mass to supermassive black holes, hinting at unified accretion and ejection
physics. To validate the unified model, we explore the correlation between the
scale of outflows (corresponding to ejection powers) and the masses of central
engines; it shows that the largest scale of outflows $\hat{LS}_\mathrm{out}$
follows a power-law correlation with the masses of accretors $M_\mathrm{core}$,
i.e., $\log{\hat{LS}_\mathrm{out}} = (0.73\pm0.01)\log{M_\mathrm{core}} -
(3.34\pm0.10)$. In conclusion, this work provides evidence to support the claim
that the ejection (and accretion) process behaves as scale-invariant and their
power is regulated by the masses of accretors.

  and rational matrices","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2008.00427",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Linearization is a widely used method for solving polynomial eigenvalue
problems (PEPs) and rational eigenvalue problem (REPs) in which the PEP/REP is
transformed to a generalized eigenproblem and then solve this generalized
eigenproblem with algorithms available in the literature. Fiedler-like pencils
(Fiedler pencils (FPs), generalized Fiedler pencils (GFPs), Fiedler pencils
with repetition (FPRs) and generalized Fiedler pencils with repetition (GFPRs))
are well known classes of strong linearizations. GFPs are an intriguing family
of linearizations, and GF pencils are the fundamental building blocks of FPRs
and GFPRs. As a result, FPRs and GFPRs have distinctive features and they
provide structure-preserving linearizations for structured matrix polynomials.
But GFPRs do not use the full potential of GF pencils. Indeed, not all the GFPs
are FPRs or GFPRs, and vice versa. The main aim of this paper is two-fold.
First, to build a unified framework for all the Fiedler-like pencils FPs, GFPs,
FPRs and GFPRs. To that end, we construct a new family of strong linearizations
(named as EGFPs) of a matrix polynomial $P(\lam)$ that subsumes all the
Fiedler-like linearizations. A salient feature of the EGFPs family is that it
allows the construction of structured preserving banded linearizations with low
bandwidth for structured (symmetric, Hermitian, palindromic) matrix polynomial.
Low bandwidth structured linearizations may be useful for numerical
computations. Second, to utilize EGFPs directly to form a family of Rosenbrock
strong linearizations of an $n \times n$ rational matrix $G(\lam)$ associated
with a realization. We describe the formulas for the construction of low
bandwidth linearizations for $P(\lam)$ and $G(\lam)$. We show that the
eigenvectors, minimal bases/indices of $P(\lam)$ and $G(\lam)$ can be easily
recovered from those of the linearizations of $P(\lam)$ and $G(\lam)$.

based fuzzer aimed at finding security vulnerabilities. BertRLFuzzer works as
follows: given a list of seed inputs, the fuzzer performs grammar-adhering and
attack-provoking mutation operations on them to generate candidate attack
vectors. The key insight of BertRLFuzzer is the combined use of two machine
learning concepts. The first one is the use of semi-supervised learning with
language models (e.g., BERT) that enables BertRLFuzzer to learn (relevant
fragments of) the grammar of a victim application as well as attack patterns,
without requiring the user to specify it explicitly. The second one is the use
of RL with BERT model as an agent to guide the fuzzer to efficiently learn
grammar-adhering and attack-provoking mutation operators. The RL-guided
feedback loop enables BertRLFuzzer to automatically search the space of attack
vectors to exploit the weaknesses of the given victim application without the
need to create labeled training data. Furthermore, these two features together
enable BertRLFuzzer to be extensible, i.e., the user can extend BertRLFuzzer to
a variety of victim applications and attack vectors automatically (i.e.,
without explicitly modifying the fuzzer or providing a grammar).
  In order to establish the efficacy of BertRLFuzzer we compare it against a
total of 13 black box and white box fuzzers over a benchmark of 9 victim
websites. We observed a significant improvement in terms of time to first
attack (54% less than the nearest competing tool), time to find all
vulnerabilities (40-60% less than the nearest competing tool), and attack rate
(4.4% more attack vectors generated than the nearest competing tool). Our
experiments show that the combination of the BERT model and RL-based learning
makes BertRLFuzzer an effective, adaptive, easy-to-use, automatic, and
extensible fuzzer.

are the characteristics of peace speech that reflect and support the social
processes that maintain peace? This study used existing peace indices, machine
learning, and on-line, news media sources to identify the words most associated
with lower-peace versus higher-peace countries. As each peace index measures
different social properties, there is little consensus on the numerical values
of these indices. There is however greater consensus with these indices for the
countries that are at the extremes of lower-peace and higher-peace. Therefore,
a data driven approach was used to find the words most important in
distinguishing lower-peace and higher-peace countries. Rather than assuming a
theoretical framework that predicts which words are more likely in lower-peace
and higher-peace countries, and then searching for those words in news media,
in this study, natural language processing and machine learning were used to
identify the words that most accurately classified a country as lower-peace or
higher-peace. Once the machine learning model was trained on the word
frequencies from the extreme lower-peace and higher-peace countries, that model
was also used to compute a quantitative peace index for these and other
intermediate-peace countries. The model successfully yielded a quantitative
peace index for intermediate-peace countries that was in between that of the
lower-peace and higher-peace, even though they were not in the training set.
This study demonstrates how natural language processing and machine learning
can help to generate new quantitative measures of social systems, which in this
study, were linguistic differences resulting in a quantitative index of peace
for countries at different levels of peacefulness.

The peak of the predicted R errors is found at 2 per cent, which is equivalent
to the peak of the published R errors. Thus, a main-sequence BC-Teff relation

the expected return of the risky asset and its volatility depend on an
unobservable Markovian term which describes the cyclical nature of asset
returns in modern financial markets. We then analyze and compare the resulting
VaR-based portfolio insurance (VBPI) strategy with the well-known constant

variety of performance evaluation criteria such as Sharpe, Omega and Kappa
ratios to compare the two methods. Our results indicate that the CPPI strategy
has a better risk-return tradeoff in most of the scenarios analyzed and
maintains a relatively stable return profile for the resulting portfolio at the

to its high potential in perpetual sensing for Internet-of-Things (IoT). By
harvesting ambient energy, battery-free devices can perform sensing
intermittently without maintenance, thus significantly improving IoT
sustainability. To build a practical intermittently-powered sensing system,
efficient routing across battery-free devices for data delivery is essential.
However, the intermittency of these devices brings new challenges, rendering
existing routing protocols inapplicable.
  In this paper, we propose RICS, the first-of-its-kind routing scheme tailored
for intermittently-powered sensing systems. RICS features two major designs,
with the goal of achieving low-latency data delivery on a network built with
battery-free devices. First, RICS incorporates a fast topology construction
protocol for each IC node to establish a path towards the sink node with the
least hop count. Second, RICS employs a low-latency message forwarding
protocol, which incorporates an efficient synchronization mechanism and a novel
technique called pendulum-sync to avoid the time-consuming repeated node
synchronization. Our evaluation based on an implementation in OMNeT++ and
comprehensive experiments with varying system settings show that RICS can

specific angular momentum $j_{\rm h}$ and mass $M_{\rm h}$ of galactic dark
matter halos has the well-established form $j_{\rm h} \propto M_{\rm h}^{2/3}$.
This is invariably adopted as the starting point in efforts to understand the
analogous relation between the specific angular momentum $j_{\ast}$ and mass
$M_{\ast}$ of the stellar parts of galaxies, which are often re-expressed
relative to the corresponding halo properties through the retention fractions
$f_j = j_{\ast} / j_{\rm h}$ and $f_M = M_{\ast} / M_{\rm h}$. An important
caveat here is that the adopted $j_{\rm h} \propto M_{\rm h}^{2/3}$ relation
could, in principle, be modified by the gravitational back-reaction of baryons
on dark matter (DM). We have tested for this possibility by comparing the
$j_{\rm h}$-$M_{\rm h}$ relations in the IllustrisTNG100 and TNG50 simulations
that include baryons (full-physics runs) with their counterparts that do not
(DM-only runs). In all cases, we find scaling relations of the form $j_{\rm h}
\propto M_{\rm h}^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha \approx 2/3$ over the ranges of mass
and redshift studied here: $M_{\rm h} \geq 10^{10} \, M_{\odot}$ and $0 \leq z
\leq 2$. The values of $\alpha$ are virtually identical in the full-physics and
DM-only runs at the same redshift. The only detectable effect of baryons on the
$j_{\rm h}$-$M_{\rm h}$ relation is a slightly higher normalization, by 12%-15%
at $z=0$ and by 5% at $z=2$. This implies that existing estimates of $f_j$
based on DM-only simulations should be adjusted downward by similar amounts.
Finally, we discuss briefly some implications of this work for studies of
galaxy formation.

the marginal likelihood and conducted using variational expectation
maximization. Our algorithm gives rise to a closed-form estimation of a
confidence value which comprises the uncertainty of clients' parameters and
local model deviations from the global model. The confidence value is used to
weigh clients' parameters in the aggregation stage and adjust the

from large-scale teacher models to small-scale student models. Therefore, data
augmentation has been widely used to mitigate the shortage of data under
specific scenarios. Classic data augmentation techniques, such as synonym
replacement and k-nearest-neighbors, are initially designed for fine-tuning. To
avoid severe semantic shifts and preserve task-specific labels, those methods
prefer to change only a small proportion of tokens (e.g., changing 10% tokens
is generally the best option for fine-tuning). However, such data augmentation
methods are sub-optimal for knowledge distillation since the teacher model
could provide label distributions and is more tolerant to semantic shifts. We
first observe that KD prefers as much data as possible, which is different from
fine-tuning that too much data will not gain more performance. Since changing
more tokens leads to more semantic shifts, we use the proportion of changed
tokens to reflect semantic shift degrees. Then we find that KD prefers
augmented data with a larger semantic shift degree (e.g., changing 30% tokens
is generally the best option for KD) than fine-tuning (changing 10% tokens).
Besides, our findings show that smaller datasets prefer larger degrees until
the out-of-distribution problem occurs (e.g., datasets with less than 10k
inputs may prefer the 50% degree, and datasets with more than 100k inputs may
prefer the 10% degree). Our work sheds light on the preference difference in
data augmentation between fine-tuning and knowledge distillation and encourages

material flux in the system. Finally, we present a discovery of a novel
topological trap present in these spirals, and is induced purely by the
geometric chirality of long winding filaments with winding number greater than
zero. A topological trap creates boundaries in the spiral across which material
cannot flow, leading to persistent structures that are topologically locked for
the lifetime of the system. The emergent mechanics of active spirals presented
here sheds light on the critical role of adhesion forces, activity and geometry
in the formation of long-term, stable, yet dynamic active patterns.

the velocity and intensity along the filament skeleton from moment maps. Clear
velocity and density fluctuations are seen along the filaments, allowing us to
fit velocity gradients around the intensity peaks. The velocity gradients
fitted to the LAsMA data and ALMA data agree with each other over the scales
covered by ALMA observations in the ATOMS survey. Changes of velocity gradient
with scale indicate a ''funnel'' structure of the velocity field in PPV space,
indicative of a smooth, continuously increasing velocity gradient from large to
small scales, and thus consistent with gravitational acceleration. The typical
velocity gradient corresponding to a 1 pc scale is ~1.6km/s/pc. Assuming
free-fall, we estimate a kinematic mass within 1 pc of ~1190 M$_\odot$, which
is consistent with typical masses of clumps in the ATLASGAL survey. We find
direct evidence for gravitational acceleration from comparison of the observed
accelerations to those predicted by free-fall onto dense hubs. On large scales,
we find that the inflow may be driven by the larger scale structure, consistent
with hierarchical structure in the molecular cloud and gas inflow from large to
small scales. The hub-filament structures at different scales may be organized
into a hierarchical system extending up to the largest scales probed, through
the coupling of gravitational centers at different scales. We argue that the
''funnel'' structure in PPV space can be an effective probe for the
gravitational collapse motions in molecular clouds. The large scale gas inflow
is driven by gravity, implying that the molecular clouds in G333 complex may be
in the state of global gravitational collapse.

using the PFLOTRAN finite volume software to model CO2 dissolution in a
kilometer-scale aquifer over 1000 y. Predictive dimensionless scaling
relationships relating CO2 dissolution rate to heterogeneity statistics,
Rayleigh (Ra) and Peclet (Pe) numbers were developed for both gravitationally

regime transition. All simulations converged quickly to a quasi-steady,
approximately linear dissolution rate. However, this rate displayed profound
variability between permeability field realizations sharing the same
heterogeneity statistics, even under mild permeability heterogeneity. In
general, increased heterogeneity was associated with a lower mean and higher
variance of dissolution rate, undesirable from a CCS design perspective. The
relationship between dissolution rate and background flow was found to be
complex and nonlinear. Dimensionless scaling relationships were uncovered for a
number of special cases. Results call into question the validity of the

that obtaining exact inference for data carving can be made computationally

reflect the status of one's overall health. In this backdrop, this work
proposes a deep learning approach to turn a smartphone-the popular hand-held
personal gadget-into a diagnostic tool to measure/monitor the three most
important body vitals, i.e., pulse rate (PR), blood oxygen saturation level
(aka SpO2), and respiratory rate (RR). Furthermore, we propose another method
that could extract a single-lead electrocardiograph (ECG) of the subject. The
proposed methods include the following core steps: subject records a small
video of his/her fingertip by placing his/her finger on the rear camera of the
smartphone, and the recorded video is pre-processed to extract the filtered
and/or detrended video-photoplethysmography (vPPG) signal, which is then fed to
custom-built convolutional neural networks (CNN), which eventually spit-out the
vitals (PR, SpO2, and RR) as well as a single-lead ECG of the subject. To be
precise, the contribution of this paper is two-fold: 1) estimation of the three
body vitals (PR, SpO2, RR) from the vPPG data using custom-built CNNs, vision
transformer, and most importantly by CLIP model; 2) a novel discrete cosine
transform+feedforward neural network-based method that translates the recorded
video- PPG signal to a single-lead ECG signal. The proposed method is
anticipated to find its application in several use-case scenarios, e.g., remote
healthcare, mobile health, fitness, sports, etc.

what kind of RKBSs can promote sparsity for learning solutions. We consider two
typical learning models in an RKBS: the minimum norm interpolation (MNI)
problem and the regularization problem. We first establish an explicit
representer theorem for solutions of these problems, which represents the
extreme points of the solution set by a linear combination of the extreme
points of the subdifferential set, of the norm function, which is
data-dependent. We then propose sufficient conditions on the RKBS that can
transform the explicit representation of the solutions to a sparse kernel
representation having fewer terms than the number of the observed data. Under
the proposed sufficient conditions, we investigate the role of the
regularization parameter on sparsity of the regularized solutions. We further
show that two specific RKBSs: the sequence space $\ell_1(\mathbb{N})$ and the

pseudovectors (magnetic field, say), or other geometric objects in each pixel.
Treating the components of these objects as independent channels in a CNN
neglects their structure entirely. Our formulation -- the GeometricImageNet --
combines a geometric generalization of convolution with outer products, tensor
index contractions, and tensor index permutations to construct geometric-image
functions of geometric images that use and benefit from the tensor structure.
The framework permits, with a very simple adjustment, restriction to function
spaces that are exactly equivariant to translations, discrete rotations, and

AlexNet and MobileNetV2, and three different datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. The results demonstrate that FAQ helps in maintaining
the baseline accuracy of the DNNs at low and moderate fault rates without
involving costly fault-aware training. For example, for ResNet-18 trained on
the CIFAR-10 dataset, at 0.04 fault rate FAQ offers (on average) an increase of
76.38% in accuracy. Similarly, for VGG11 trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, at

results also show that FAQ incurs negligible overheads, i.e., less than 5% of

immersed in a homogeneous magnetic field $B$, the dimensionless parameter
$b=eBGM/ (mc^4)$ controls the radius of the circular orbits and determines the
position of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), where $m$ and $e$ are
the mass and charge of the particle. For large values of the parameter $b$, the
ISCO radius can be very close to the gravitational radius. We demonstrate that
the properties of such orbits can be effectively and easily found by using a
properly constructed ``near-horizon approximation''. In particular, we show
that the effective potential (which determines the position of the orbit) can
be written in a form which is invariant under rescaling of the magnetic field,
and as a result is universal in this sense. We also demonstrate that in the
near-horizon approximation, the particle orbits are stationary worldlines in
Minkowski spacetime. We use this property to solve the equation describing slow
changes in the distance of the particle orbit from the horizon, which arise as
a result of the electromagnetic field radiated by the particle itself. This
allows us to evaluate the life-time of the particle before it reaches the ISCO

has been studied extensively with amplitudes derived for various potentials. In
this article, we explore a setting with no potentials, where scattering occurs
off a junction where many wires meet. We study this problem using a
tight-binding discretization of a star graph geometry -- one incoming wire and
$M$ outgoing wires intersecting at a point. When an incoming wave scatters, one
part is reflected along the same wire while the rest is transmitted along the
others. Remarkably, the reflectance increases monotonically with $M$, i.e., the
greater the number of outgoing channels, the more the particle bounces back. In
the $M \rightarrow \infty$ limit, the wave is entirely reflected back along the
incoming wire. We rationalize this observation by establishing a quantitative
mapping between a junction and an on-site potential. To each junction, we
assign an equivalent potential that produces the same reflectance. As the
number of wires ($M$) increases, the equivalent potential also increases. A
recent article by one of us has drawn an equivalence between junctions and
potentials from the point of view of bound state formation. Our results here
show that the same equivalence also holds for scattering amplitudes. We verify
our analytic results by simulating wavepacket motion through a junction. We
extend the wavepacket approach to two dimensions where analytic solutions
cannot be found. An incoming wave travels on a sheet and scatters off a point
where many sheets intersect. Unlike in 1D, the equivalent potential is
momentum-dependent. Nevertheless, for any given momentum, the equivalent
potential grows monotonically with the number of intersecting sheets. Our
findings can be tested in ultracold atom setups and semiconductor structures.

Further, the generated images often lack diversity in terms of the number of

iWarpGAN that disentangles identity and style in the context of the iris

to generate unique identities from the training set, and Style Transformation
Pathway to extract the style code from a reference image and output an iris

determining fidelity of a pulse program is challenging without the knowledge of
the ideal results. In this paper, we propose to use reversed pulses to evaluate
the performance of quantum pulses, which can provide guidance to design pulse

method enables us to evaluate the fidelity of pulse programs by measuring the

the disk temperature particularly at the inner disk midplane where planets

compared with the ALMA dust continuum observations at Bands 4, 6, 7 and 8, with
an angular resolution of 0.1 arcsec. The observed brightness temperatures are
almost wavelength-indenpendent at $\lesssim$10 au. We find that if the maximum
dust size $a_{\rm max}$ is $\lesssim100~{\rm \mu m}$, the brightness
temperatures predicted by the model exceed the observed values, regardless of
the efficiency of accretion heating. The low observed brightness temperatures
can be explained if millimeter scattering reduces the intensity. If the disk is
passive, $a_{\rm max}$ needs to be either $\sim150~{\rm \mu m}$ or $\gtrsim$
few ${\rm cm}$. The accretion heating significantly increases the brightness
temperature particularly when $a_{\rm max}\lesssim300~{\rm \mu m}$, and hence
$a_{\rm max}$ needs to be either $\sim300~{\rm \mu m}$ or $\gtrsim$ few ${\rm

the observed brightness temperatures, depending on the models. The dust
settling effectively increases the temperature of the dust responsible for the
millimeter emission in the active disk, which makes the model with $300~{\rm
\mu m}$-sized dust overpredicts the brightness temperatures when strong
turbulence is absent. Porous dust (porosity of 0.9) makes the accretion heating
more efficient so that some sort of reduction in accretion heating is required.

validated by simulating the finger-shaped GelTip sensor and comparing the

extensive experiments show that combining the illumination generated from the
geodesic paths, with a background image from the real sensor, produces the best
results when compared to the lighting generated by direct linear paths in the

applied in principle to simulate a tactile sensor of any morphology. The
proposed method not only unlocks simulating existing optical tactile sensors of

achieve this by deploying a result of Berger-Ginzburg-Taillefer on deformations

  We finish the paper with examples, including a full treatment of the

human-autonomy teams where one human agent interacts with one robot. There is
little, if not no, research on trust modeling in teams consisting of multiple
human agents and multiple robotic agents.
  To fill this research gap, we present the trust inference and propagation
(TIP) model for trust modeling in multi-human multi-robot teams. In a
multi-human multi-robot team, we postulate that there exist two types of
experiences that a human agent has with a robot: direct and indirect
experiences. The TIP model presents a novel mathematical framework that
explicitly accounts for both types of experiences. To evaluate the model, we
conducted a human-subject experiment with 15 pairs of participants (${N=30}$).
Each pair performed a search and detection task with two drones. Results show
that our TIP model successfully captured the underlying trust dynamics and
significantly outperformed a baseline model. To the best of our knowledge, the
TIP model is the first mathematical framework for computational trust modeling
in multi-human multi-robot teams.

solutions with spherical symmetry of the Cauchy problem for the Euler-Poisson
equations as the inviscid limit of the corresponding compressible
Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations. The strong convergence of the vanishing
viscosity solutions is achieved through entropy analysis, uniform estimates in
$L^p$, and a more general compensated compactness framework via several new
main ingredients. A key estimate is first established for the integrability of
the density over unbounded domains independent of the vanishing viscosity
coefficient. Then a special entropy pair is carefully designed via solving a
Goursat problem for the entropy equation such that a higher integrability of
the velocity is established, which is a crucial step. Moreover, the weak
entropy kernel for the general pressure law and its fractional derivatives of
the required order near vacuum ($\rho=0$) and far-field ($\rho=\infty$) are
carefully analyzed. Owing to the generality of the pressure law, only the
$W^{-1,p}_{\mathrm{loc}}$-compactness of weak entropy dissipation measures with
$p\in [1,2)$ can be obtained; this is rescued by the equi-integrability of weak
entropy pairs which can be established by the estimates obtained above, so that
the div-curl lemma still applies. Finally, based on the above analysis of weak
entropy pairs, the $L^p$ compensated compactness framework for the compressible
Euler equations with general pressure law is established. This new compensated
compactness framework and the techniques developed in this paper should be
useful for solving further nonlinear problems with similar features.

impossible to provide exact conditional coverage universally in finite samples.
Thus, most popular methods only provide marginal coverage over the covariates.
This paper bridges this gap by defining a spectrum of problems that interpolate
between marginal and conditional validity. We motivate these problems by
reformulating conditional coverage as coverage over a class of covariate
shifts. When the target class of shifts is finite dimensional, we show how to
simultaneously obtain exact finite sample coverage over all possible shifts.
For example, given a collection of protected subgroups, our algorithm outputs
intervals with exact coverage over each group. For more flexible, infinite
dimensional classes where exact coverage is impossible, we provide a simple
procedure for quantifying the gap between the coverage of our algorithm and the
target level. Moreover, by tuning a single hyperparameter, we allow the

cancer-adipose conversion (CAC), we adopt a systems biology approach by combing
mathematical modeling and molecular experiments based on the underlying

correspond to epithelial (E), mesenchymal (M), adipose (A) and
partial/intermediate EMT (P) cell states on the CAC landscape. Landscape and
transition path results illustrate that the intermediate states play critical
roles in cancer to adipose transition. Through a landscape control strategy, we
identified two new therapeutic strategies for drug combinations to promote CAC.
We further verified these predictions by molecular experiments in different

closely related to some chemical properties of molecules, such as efficacy, and
metabolic properties, which cannot be solely determined by individual atoms. In
this paper, we introduce a new model for molecular representation learning
called the Atomic and Subgraph-aware Bilateral Aggregation (ASBA), which
addresses the limitations of previous atom-wise and subgraph-wise models by
incorporating both types of information. ASBA consists of two branches, one for
atom-wise information and the other for subgraph-wise information. Considering
existing atom-wise GNNs cannot properly extract invariant subgraph features, we
propose a decomposition-polymerization GNN architecture for the subgraph-wise

self-supervised learning strategies for ASBA to improve its generalization. Our

complicated by LM brittleness: when a presumably biased outcome is observed, is
it due to model bias or model brittleness? We propose enlisting the models
themselves to help construct bias auditing datasets that remain challenging,
and introduce bias measures that distinguish between types of model errors.
First, we extend an existing bias benchmark for NLI (BBNLI) using a combination
of LM-generated lexical variations, adversarial filtering, and human

challenging than BBNLI: on average, BBNLI-next reduces the accuracy of
state-of-the-art NLI models from 95.3%, as observed by BBNLI, to 58.6%. Second,
we employ BBNLI-next to showcase the interplay between robustness and bias, and
the subtlety in differentiating between the two. Third, we point out
shortcomings in current bias scores used in the literature and propose bias
measures that take into account pro-/anti-stereotype bias and model

We find that community-level SDOH features do not improve model performance for
a general patient population, but can improve data-limited model fairness for
specific subpopulations. We also demonstrate that SDOH features are vital for
conducting thorough audits of algorithmic biases beyond protective attributes.

the functional data are smooth, latent functions obtained at discrete time
intervals and prone to homoscedastic white noise. However, the assumption of
homoscedastic errors might not be appropriate in this setting because the
devices collect the data serially. While researchers have previously addressed
measurement error in scalar covariates prone to errors, less work has been done
on correcting measurement error in high dimensional longitudinal curves prone
to heteroscedastic errors. We present two new methods for correcting
measurement error in longitudinal functional curves prone to complex
measurement error structures in multi-level generalized functional linear
regression models. These methods are based on two-stage scalable regression
calibration. We assume that the distribution of the scalar responses and the
surrogate measures prone to heteroscedastic errors both belong in the
exponential family and that the measurement errors follow Gaussian processes.
In simulations and sensitivity analyses, we established some finite sample
properties of these methods. In our simulations, both regression calibration
methods for correcting measurement error performed better than estimators based
on averaging the longitudinal functional data and using observations from a

partial annotation, which reduces labeling costs for structured outputs by
selecting only the most informative substructures for annotation. We also
utilize selftraining to incorporate the current model's automatic predictions

combining partial annotation with self-training to reduce annotation cost is
determining which sub-structures to select to label. To address this challenge
we adopt an error estimator to decide the partial selection ratio adaptively

over strong full annotation baselines under a fair comparison scheme that takes

exhibit fuzzy boundaries. The complex environmental conditions and the high

significant challenges in accurately locating and segmenting these objects in
their entirety. While existing methods have demonstrated remarkable performance
in various real-world scenarios, they still face limitations when confronted
with difficult cases, such as small targets, thin structures, and indistinct
boundaries. Drawing inspiration from human visual perception when observing
images containing camouflaged objects, we propose a three-stage model that
enables coarse-to-fine segmentation in a single iteration. Specifically, our
model employs three decoders to sequentially process subsampled features,
cropped features, and high-resolution original features. This proposed approach
not only reduces computational overhead but also mitigates interference caused
by background noise. Furthermore, considering the significance of multi-scale
information, we have designed a multi-scale feature enhancement module that
enlarges the receptive field while preserving detailed structural cues.
Additionally, a boundary enhancement module has been developed to enhance
performance by leveraging boundary information. Subsequently, a mask-guided
fusion module is proposed to generate fine-grained results by integrating
coarse prediction maps with high-resolution feature maps. Our network surpasses

future wireless standards. Substantial progress has been made in this field,
with advances in hardware design, channel models, and signal processing.
High-rate backhaul links operating at sub-THz frequencies have been
experimentally demonstrated. However, there are inherent challenges in making
the next great leap for adopting the THz band in widespread communication
systems, such as cellular access and wireless local area networks. Primarily,
such systems have to be both: (i) wideband, to maintain desired data rate and
sensing resolution; and, more importantly, (ii) operate in the massive near
field of the high-gain devices required to overcome the propagation losses. In
this article, it is first explained why the state-of-the-art techniques from
lower frequencies, including millimeter-wave, cannot be simply repurposed to
realize THz band communication systems. Then, a vision of wavefront engineering
is presented to address these shortfalls. Further, it is illustrated how novel
implementations of specific wavefronts, such as Bessel beams and Airy beams,
offer attractive advantages in creating THz links over state-of-the-art
far-field beamforming and near-field beamfocusing techniques. The paper ends by

Diverse sets of stimuli have become accessible in which the spatially dependant

studies with human perception of polarization have dealt with stimuli that
appear to vary azimuthally. This is mainly due to the constraint that the
typically available degree of freedom to manipulate the phase shift of light
rotates the perceived pattern around a person's point of fixation. Here we
create a structured light stimulus that is perceived to vary purely along the
radial direction and test discrimination sensitivity to inwards and outwards
radial motion. This is accomplished by preparing a radial state coupled to an
orbital angular momentum state that matches the orientation of the dichroic

With such ""label bias"", one should exclude a feature if its correlation with

a feature is weakly correlated with the true outcome, and, additionally, that

differentiate the tendency to retain existing ties over time. With $n$ observed
networks each having $p$ nodes, we develop a new asymptotic theory for the
maximum likelihood estimation of $2p$ parameters when $np\rightarrow \infty$.
We overcome the global non-convexity of the negative log-likelihood function by
the virtue of its local convexity, and propose a novel method of moment
estimator as the initial value for a simple algorithm that leads to the
consistent local maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). To establish the upper
bounds for the estimation error of the MLE, we derive a new uniform deviation

reconstruction, such as point cloud (PC), are facing the challenges that sample
points are too sparse and the precision is insufficient. On the other hand,
there is a scarcity of high-density point cloud datasets, which makes it
challenging to train models for direct reconstruction of high-density brain
point clouds. In this work, a novel model named stereoscopic-aware graph
generative adversarial network (SG-GAN) with two stages is proposed to generate
fine high-density PC conditioned on a single image. The Stage-I GAN sketches
the primitive shape and basic structure of the organ based on the given image,
yielding Stage-I point clouds. The Stage-II GAN takes the results from Stage-I
and generates high-density point clouds with detailed features. The Stage-II
GAN is capable of correcting defects and restoring the detailed features of the
region of interest (ROI) through the up-sampling process. Furthermore, a
parameter-free-attention-based free-transforming module is developed to learn
the efficient features of input, while upholding a promising performance.
Comparing with the existing methods, the SG-GAN model shows superior
performance in terms of visual quality, objective measurements, and performance
in classification, as demonstrated by comprehensive results measured by several
evaluation metrics including PC-to-PC error and Chamfer distance.

well-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to the

adaptation. To handle this, we propose to mine the hidden knowledge of the
source model and exploit it to generate source avatar prototypes. To this end,
we propose a Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method.
CPGA consists of two stages: Prototype generation and Prototype adaptation.
Extensive experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CPGA. However, existing SF.UDA studies implicitly assume
balanced class distributions for both the source and target domains, which
hinders their real applications. To address this issue, we study a more
practical SF-UDA task, termed imbalance-agnostic SF-UDA, where the class
distributions of both the unseen source domain and unlabeled target domain are
unknown and could be arbitrarily skewed. This task is much more challenging
than vanilla SF-UDA due to the co-occurrence of covariate shifts and
unidentified class distribution shifts between the source and target domains.
To address this task, we extend CPGA and propose a new Target-aware Contrastive
Prototype Generation and Adaptation (T-CPGA) method. Specifically, for better
prototype adaptation in the imbalance-agnostic scenario, T-CPGA applies a new
pseudo label generation strategy to identify unknown target class distribution
and generate accurate pseudo labels, by utilizing the collective intelligence
of the source model and an additional contrastive language-image pre-trained
model. Meanwhile, we further devise a target label-distribution-aware
classifier to adapt the model to the unknown target class distribution. We
empirically show that T-CPGA significantly outperforms CPGA and other SF-UDA
methods in imbalance-agnostic SF-UDA.

preference semantic and preserves other model parameters locally to capture
user personalization. Besides, it deploys a meta attribute network on the

each client can make recommendations with item feature semantic learned from
the meta attribute network by incorporating the locally personalized model
without retraining. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
IFedRec's outstanding performance for cold-start recommendation. Besides,
in-depth analysis verifies IFedRec's learning ability for cold items while

recognition. However, due to the diverse intra-class spatial layouts and the
coexisting inter-class objects, modeling contextual relationships to adapt
various image characteristics is a great challenge. Existing contextual
modeling methods for indoor scene recognition exhibit two limitations: 1)
During training, space-independent information, such as color, may hinder
optimizing the network's capacity to represent the spatial context. 2) These
methods often overlook the differences in coexisting objects across different
scenes, suppressing the performance of scene recognition. To address these
limitations, we propose SpaCoNet, a novel approach that simultaneously models
the Spatial relation and Co-occurrence of objects based on semantic
segmentation. Firstly, the semantic spatial relation module (SSRM) is designed
to explore the spatial relations among objects within a scene. With the help of
semantic segmentation, this module decouples the spatial information from the
image, effectively avoiding the influence of irrelevant features. Secondly,
both spatial context features from SSRM and deep features from RGB feature
extractor are used to distinguish the coexisting object across different
scenes. Finally, utilizing the discriminative features mentioned above, we
employ the self-attention mechanism to explore the long-range co-occurrence
relationships among objects, and further generate a semantic-guided feature
representation for indoor scene recognition. Experimental results on three
publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed method. The code will be made publicly available after the
blind-review process is completed.

reviews the levels of automation in AEVs, their disengagement frequencies, and
on-road accident reports. According to the report, numerous manufacturers
thoroughly tested AEVs across a distance of more than 3.9 million miles between
2014 and 2022. Disengagement frequencies vary among manufacturers, and
approximately 65% of accidents during this period occurred while AEVs were
operating in autonomous mode. Notably, the majority of accidents (90%) were
caused by other road users, with only a small fraction (approximately 8%)
directly attributed to AEVs. Enhancing AEVs' ability to detect and mitigate
safety risks from external sources has the potential to significantly improve
their safety. This paper provides valuable insights into AEV safety by
emphasizing the importance of comprehensively understanding AEV development and
reported accidents. Through the analysis of disengagement and accident reports,
the study highlights the prevalence of passive accidents caused by other road
users. Future research should concentrate on enabling AEVs to effectively
detect and respond to safety risks originating from external sources to enhance
AEV safety. Overall, this analysis contributes to the ongoing efforts in AEV

highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and

responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous
theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers,
neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature that is characteristic of
epithelial tissues in vivo. In this study, we investigate the role of surface
curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model
embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature
promotes epithelial unjamming by reducing the energy barriers to cellular
rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and
self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and
migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. As
such, curvature-induced unjamming emerges as a novel mechanism for epithelial
layer fluidization. Our quantitative model proposes the existence of a new,
extended, phase diagram wherein local cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue
geometry combine to determine the epithelial migratory phenotype.

Transformer (NAGphormer) that treats each node as a sequence containing a
series of tokens constructed by our proposed Hop2Token module. For each node,
Hop2Token aggregates the neighborhood features from different hops into
different representations, producing a sequence of token vectors as one input.
In this way, NAGphormer could be trained in a mini-batch manner and thus could
scale to large graphs. Moreover, we mathematically show that compared to a
category of advanced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), called decoupled Graph
Convolutional Networks, NAGphormer could learn more informative node
representations from multi-hop neighborhoods. In addition, we propose a new
data augmentation method called Neighborhood Augmentation (NrAug) based on the
output of Hop2Token that augments simultaneously the features of neighborhoods
from global as well as local views to strengthen the training effect of
NAGphormer. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets from small to large

layers, comprising the same set of self-attention and feed-forward layers as

important roles in marine exploration. The highly noisy acoustic signal and
time-frequency interference among various sources pose big challenges to this
task. To tackle these issues, we propose a multimodal approach to extract and
fuse audio-visual-textual information to recognize and localize underwater
targets through the designed Symbiotic Transformer (Symb-Trans) and Multi-View
Regression (MVR) method. The multimodal data were first preprocessed by a
custom-designed HetNorm module to normalize the multi-source data in a common
feature space. The Symb-Trans module embeds audiovisual features by co-training
the preprocessed multimodal features through parallel branches and a content
encoder with cross-attention. The audiovisual features are then used for
underwater target recognition. Meanwhile, the text embedding combined with the
audiovisual features is fed to an MVR module to predict the localization of the
underwater targets through multi-view clustering and multiple regression. Since
no off-the-shell multimodal dataset is available for UATR and UATL, we combined
multiple public datasets, consisting of acoustic, and/or visual, and/or
textural data, to obtain audio-visual-textual triplets for model training and
validation. Experiments show that our model outperforms comparative methods in
91.7% (11 out of 12 metrics) and 100% (4 metrics) of the quantitative metrics
for the recognition and localization tasks, respectively. In a case study, we
demonstrate the advantages of multi-view models in establishing sample
discriminability through visualization methods. For UATL, the proposed MVR
method produces the relation graphs, which allow predictions based on records
of underwater targets with similar conditions.

This paper delves into the association capabilities of language models, aiming
to uncover the factors that influence their proficiency in associating

associate entities/information intensifies, particularly when target pairs
demonstrate shorter co-occurrence distances or higher co-occurrence

Despite the proportion of accurately predicted PII being relatively small, LLMs
still demonstrate the capability to predict specific instances of email

findings underscore the potential risk to PII confidentiality posed by the
evolving capabilities of LLMs, especially as they continue to expand in scale

(MLE) of the imprecise label information, treating the precise labels as latent
variables. Compared to previous versatile methods attempting to infer correct
labels from the imprecise label information, our ILL framework considers all
possible labeling imposed by the imprecise label information, allowing a
unified solution to deal with any imprecise labels. With comprehensive
experimental results, we demonstrate that ILL can seamlessly adapt to various
situations, including partial label learning, semi-supervised learning, noisy
label learning, and a mixture of these settings. Notably, our simple method
surpasses the existing techniques for handling imprecise labels, marking the
first unified framework with robust and effective performance across various
imprecise labels. We believe that our approach has the potential to
significantly enhance the performance of machine learning models on tasks where
obtaining precise labels is expensive and complicated. We hope our work will
inspire further research on this topic with an open-source codebase release.

relies on a text prompt as its input, which is encoded using the Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP). However, text prompts have limitations when
it comes to incorporating implicit information from reference images. Existing
methods have attempted to address this limitation by employing expensive
training procedures involving millions of training samples for image-to-image
generation. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that the CLIP model, as
utilized in Stable Diffusion, inherently possesses the ability to
instantaneously convert images into text prompts. Such an image-to-prompt
conversion can be achieved by utilizing a linear projection matrix that is
calculated in a closed form. Moreover, the paper showcases that this capability
can be further enhanced by either utilizing a small amount of similar-domain
training data (approximately 100 images) or incorporating several online
training steps (around 30 iterations) on the reference images. By leveraging
these approaches, the proposed method offers a simple and flexible solution to
bridge the gap between images and text prompts. This methodology can be applied
to various tasks such as image variation and image editing, facilitating more
effective and seamless interaction between images and textual prompts.

However, these require additional parameters for each layer, and are criticized

task-agnostic domain adaptation method which is modular, parameter-efficient,
and thus, data-efficient. Within TADA, we retrain the embeddings to learn
domain-aware input representations and tokenizers for the transformer encoder,
while freezing all other parameters of the model. Then, task-specific
fine-tuning is performed. We further conduct experiments with meta-embeddings
and newly introduced meta-tokenizers, resulting in one model per task in
multi-domain use cases. Our broad evaluation in 4 downstream tasks for 14
domains across single- and multi-domain setups and high- and low-resource

  This paper introduces hierarchical structured sparsity (HSS), with the key
insight that we can systematically represent diverse sparsity degrees by having
them hierarchically composed from multiple simple sparsity patterns. As a
result, HSS simplifies the underlying hardware since it only needs to support
simple sparsity patterns; this significantly reduces the sparsity acceleration
overhead, which improves efficiency. Motivated by such opportunities, we
propose a simultaneously efficient and flexible accelerator, named HighLight,
to accelerate DNNs that have diverse sparsity degrees (including dense). Due to
the flexibility of HSS, different HSS patterns can be introduced to DNNs to
meet different applications' accuracy requirements. Compared to existing works,
HighLight achieves a geomean of up to 6.4x better energy-delay product (EDP)

  Detection: An Empirical Study","12 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables, submitted to Empirical Software
  Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) 2023",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Machine Learning (ML) methods are being increasingly used for
automating different activities, e.g., Test Case Prioritization (TCP), of
Continuous Integration (CI). However, ML models need frequent retraining as a
result of changes in the CI environment, more commonly known as data drift.
Also, continuously retraining ML models consume a lot of time and effort.
Hence, there is an urgent need of identifying and evaluating suitable
approaches that can help in reducing the retraining efforts and time for ML
models used for TCP in CI environments. Aims: This study aims to investigate
the performance of using data drift detection techniques for automatically
detecting the retraining points for ML models for TCP in CI environments
without requiring detailed knowledge of the software projects. Method: We
employed the Hellinger distance to identify changes in both the values and
distribution of input data and leveraged these changes as retraining points for
the ML model. We evaluated the efficacy of this method on multiple datasets and
compared the APFDc and NAPFD evaluation metrics against models that were
regularly retrained, with careful consideration of the statistical methods.
Results: Our experimental evaluation of the Hellinger distance-based method
demonstrated its efficacy and efficiency in detecting retraining points and
reducing the associated costs. However, the performance of this method may vary
depending on the dataset. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that data drift
detection methods can assist in identifying retraining points for ML models in
CI environments, while significantly reducing the required retraining time.
These methods can be helpful for practitioners who lack specialized knowledge
of software projects, enabling them to maintain ML model accuracy.

overlooks additional contextual information from neighboring sub-graphs of

local sub-graphs have been found to provide important information for knowledge
graph completion. Inspired by these observations, we propose Logical Entity
RePresentation (LERP) to encode contextual information of entities in the
knowledge graph. A LERP is designed as a vector of probabilistic logical
functions on the entity's neighboring sub-graph. It is an interpretable
representation while allowing for differentiable optimization. We can then
incorporate LERP into probabilistic logical rule learning to learn more
expressive rules. Empirical results demonstrate that with LERP, our model
outperforms other rule learning methods in knowledge graph completion and is
comparable or even superior to state-of-the-art black-box methods. Moreover, we
find that our model can discover a more expressive family of logical rules.

massive factual knowledge in their parameters. However, the stored knowledge
could be false or out-dated. Traditional knowledge editing methods refine LLMs
via fine-tuning on texts containing specific knowledge. However, with the
increasing scales of LLMs, these gradient-based approaches bring large
computation costs. The trend of model-as-a-service also makes it impossible to
modify knowledge in black-box LMs. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), a new
paradigm based on demonstration contexts without parameter updating, we explore
whether ICL can edit factual knowledge. To answer this question, we give a
comprehensive empirical study of ICL strategies. Experiments show that
in-context knowledge editing (IKE), without any gradient and parameter
updating, achieves a competitive success rate compared to gradient-based
methods on GPT-J (6B) but with much fewer side effects, including less
over-editing on similar but unrelated facts and less knowledge forgetting on
previously stored knowledge. We also apply the method to larger LMs with tens

alleviate the cross-view discrepancy to learn consensus semantics without

unaffected by cross-view distribution shifts, making them useful for
realigning/imputing defective instances and forming clusters. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of SMILE through extensive comparison experiments with 13

paper presents the first XWS-TC benchmark to compare the two approaches on fair

SEED and PROMPT approaches are competitive and there is no clear winner; (2)
SEED is empirically more tolerant than PROMPT to human guidance (e.g., seed

booster to both. We hope this benchmark serves as a guideline in selecting

these methods adopt discrete prompting by simply translating the templates to
the target language and need external expert knowledge to design the templates.
Besides, discrete prompts of human-designed template words are not trainable
vectors and can not be migrated to target languages in the inference stage
flexibly. In this paper, we propose a novel Soft prompt learning framework with
the Multilingual Verbalizer (SoftMV) for XNLI. SoftMV first constructs
cloze-style question with soft prompts for the input sample. Then we leverage
bilingual dictionaries to generate an augmented multilingual question for the

demonstrate that SoftMV can achieve state-of-the-art performance and

(MoTe2) encompasses two semimetallic phases (1T_prime and Td) which
differentiate from each other via a slight tilting of the out-of-plane lattice.
Both phases are subjected to serious phase mixing which complicates the
analysis of its origin of superconductivity. Herein, we explore the
electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of the monolayer semimetallic MoTe2, without
phase ambiguity under this thickness limit. Apart from the hardening or
softening of phonon modes, the strength of the EPC can be strongly modulated by
doping. Specifically, longitudinal and out-of-plane acoustic modes are
significantly activated for electron doped MoTe2. This is ascribed to the
presence of rich valley states and equispaced nesting bands which are
dynamically populated under charge doping. Through comparing the monolayer and
bilayer MoTe2, the strength of EPC is found to be less likely to depend on
thickness for neutral samples but clearly promoted for thinner samples with
electron doping, while for hole doping, the strength alters more significantly
with the thickness than doping. Our work explains the puzzling issue of the
doping sensitivity of the superconductivity in semimetallic MoTe2 and
establishes the critical role of activating acoustic phonons in such
low-dimensional materials.

few demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or
updating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capabilities
of LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs
acquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a
transformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after
pre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMs
can simulate kernel regression algorithms when faced with in-context examples.
More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on in-context prompts
can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\hat y = \frac{\sum_i
y_i K(x, x_i)}{\sum_i K(x, x_i)}$ as the number of in-context demonstrations
grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors of language
models. We find that during ICL, the attentions and hidden features in LLMs
match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory provides
insights on multiple phenomena observed in ICL field: why retrieving
demonstrative samples similar to test sample can help, why ICL performance is
sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits from selecting
in-distribution and representative samples. We will make our code available to

$k$-uniform states in homogeneous systems. However, the study of entanglement
for heterogeneous systems is much more challenging than that for the
homogeneous case. There are very few results known for the $k$-uniform states
in heterogeneous systems for $k>3$. We present two general methods to construct
$k$-uniform states in the heterogeneous systems for general $k$. The first
construction is derived from the error correcting codes by establishing a
connection between irredundant mixed orthogonal arrays and error correcting

a matrix $H$ meeting the condition that $H_{A\times \bar{A}}+H^T_{\bar{A}\times

construction can provide more flexible choices for the local dimensions, i.e.,

To eliminate the domain gaps between different aspects, we utilize a

the formulation of joint energy-based models (EBMs) and the plugging in of

causal inference literature, which has received significant recent attention,
especially with the presence of high-dimensional confounders. We consider the
ATE estimation problem in high dimensions when the observed outcome (or label)
itself is possibly missing. The labeling indicator's conditional propensity
score is allowed to depend on the covariates, and also decay uniformly with
sample size - thus allowing for the unlabeled data size to grow faster than the
labeled data size. Such a setting fills in an important gap in both the
semi-supervised (SS) and missing data literatures. We consider a missing at
random (MAR) mechanism that allows selection bias - this is typically forbidden
in the standard SS literature, and without a positivity condition - this is
typically required in the missing data literature. We first propose a general
doubly robust 'decaying' MAR (DR-DMAR) SS estimator for the ATE, which is
constructed based on flexible (possibly non-parametric) nuisance estimators.
The general DR-DMAR SS estimator is shown to be doubly robust, as well as
asymptotically normal (and efficient) when all the nuisance models are
correctly specified. Additionally, we propose a bias-reduced DR-DMAR SS
estimator based on (parametric) targeted bias-reducing nuisance estimators
along with a special asymmetric cross-fitting strategy. We demonstrate that the
bias-reduced ATE estimator is asymptotically normal as long as either the
outcome regression or the propensity score model is correctly specified.
Moreover, the required sparsity conditions are weaker than all the existing
doubly robust causal inference literature even under the regular supervised
setting - this is a special degenerate case of our setting. Lastly, this work
also contributes to the growing literature on generalizability in causal
inference.

noticeable alteration of the chemical state of N atoms, which is unexpected for
the pure BTANC molecule. In addition, molecular imaging of the monolayer by

progress across various natural language processing tasks. As pre-training and
fine-tuning are costly and might negatively impact model performance, it is
desired to efficiently adapt an existing model to different conditions such as
styles, sentiments or narratives, when facing different audiences or scenarios.
However, efficient adaptation of a language model to diverse conditions remains
an open challenge. This work is inspired by the observation that text
conditions are often associated with selection of certain words in a context.
Therefore we introduce LM-Switch, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and
simple method for generative language model conditioning. We begin by
investigating the effect of conditions in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and
establish a theoretical connection with language model. Our finding suggests
that condition shifts in HMMs are associated with linear transformations in
word embeddings. LM-Switch is then designed to deploy a learnable linear factor
in the word embedding space for language model conditioning. We show that
LM-Switch can model diverse tasks, and achieves comparable or better
performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines in LM detoxification and
generation control, despite requiring no more than 1% of parameters compared
with baselines and little extra time overhead compared with base LMs. It is

intra-domain settings but easily degrades on unseen domains. Conventional
domain generalization methods mitigate the gap by learning domain-invariant
features. However, they ignore the discriminative information in the
domain-specific features. Moreover, we usually face a more realistic scenario
with only one single domain available for training. To tackle the above issues,
we propose a Single Domain Dynamic Generalization (SDDG) framework, which
simultaneously exploits domain-invariant and domain-specific features on a
per-sample basis and learns to generalize to various unseen domains with
numerous natural images. Specifically, a dynamic block is designed to
adaptively adjust the network with a dynamic adaptor. And an information
maximization loss is further combined to increase diversity. The whole network
is integrated into the meta-learning paradigm. We generate amplitude perturbed
images and cover diverse domains with natural images. Therefore, the network
can learn to generalize to the perturbed domains in the meta-test phase.
Extensive experiments show the proposed method is effective and outperforms the
state-of-the-art on LivDet-Iris 2017 dataset.

we use pre-trained label embeddings to cluster the labels into semantic domains

consistently leads to improved results, as long as high-quality label

detection methods have been proposed to enable extremely large-scale massive
multiple-input multiple-output technology. Under the DBP architecture, base
station antennas are divided into several independent clusters, each connected
to a local computing fabric. However, current detection methods tailored to DBP
only consider ideal white Gaussian noise scenarios, while in practice, the
noise is often colored due to interference from neighboring cells. Moreover, in
the DBP architecture, linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) detection
methods rely on the estimation of the noise covariance matrix through averaging
distributedly stored noise samples. This presents a significant challenge for
decentralized LMMSE-based equalizer design. To address this issue, this paper
proposes decentralized LMMSE equalization methods under colored noise scenarios
for both star and daisy chain DBP architectures. Specifically, we first propose
two decentralized equalizers for the star DBP architecture based on
dimensionality reduction techniques. Then, we derive an optimal decentralized
equalizer using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method for the daisy chain
DBP architecture with a bandwidth reduction enhancement scheme based on
decentralized low-rank decomposition. Finally, simulation results demonstrate
that our proposed methods can achieve excellent detection performance while
requiring much less communication bandwidth.

  Transfer by an Explicit Inter-task Distance",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Scheduling problems are often tackled independently, and rarely solved by
leveraging the commonalities across problems. Lack of awareness of this
inter-task similarity could impede the search efficacy. A quantifiable
relationship between scheduling problems is to-date rather unclear, how to
leverage it in combinatorial optimization remains largely unknown, and its
effects on search are also undeterminable. This paper addresses these hard
questions by delving into quantifiable useful inter-task relationships and,
through leveraging the explicit relationship, presenting a speed-up algorithm.
After deriving an analytical inter-task distance metric to quantitatively
reveal latent similarity across scheduling problems, an adaptive transfer of
multi-modality knowledge is devised to promptly adjust the transfer in forms of
explicit and implicit knowledge in response to heterogeneity in the inter-task
discrepancy. For faintly related problems with disappearing dependences, a
problem transformation function is suggested with a matching-feature-based
greedy policy, and the function projects faintly related problems into a latent
space where these problems gain similarity in a way that creates search
speed-ups. Finally, a multi-task scatter search combinatorial algorithm is
formed and a large-scale multi-task benchmark is generated serving the purposes
of validation. That the algorithm exhibits dramatic speed-ups of 2~3 orders of
magnitude, as compared to direct problem solving in strongly related problems
and 3 times faster in weakly related ones, suggests leveraging commonality
across problems could be successful.

internal surface and severely confining porosity of nanoporous hosts, the
transport of nanoconfined fluids remains puzzling by many aspects. With
striking examples such as memory, \textit{i.e.} non-viscous, effects,
intermittent dynamics and surface barriers, the dynamics of fluids in
nanoconfinement challenges classical formalisms (\textit{e.g.} random walk,
viscous/advective transport) -- especially for molecular pore sizes. In this
context, while molecular frameworks such as intermittent brownian motion, free
volume theory and surface diffusion are available to describe the
self-diffusion of a molecularly confined fluid, a microscopic theory for the
collective diffusion (\textit{i.e.} permeability) -- which characterizes the
flow induced by a thermodynamic gradient -- is lacking. Here, to fill this
knowledge gap, we invoke the concept of `De Gennes narrowing' which relates the
wavevector-dependent collective diffusivity $D_0(q)$ to the fluid structure
factor $S(q)$. First, using molecular simulation for a simple yet
representative fluid confined in a prototypical solid (zeolite), we unravel an
essential coupling between the wavevector-dependent collective diffusivity and
the structural ordering imposed on the fluid by the crystalline nanoporous
host. Second, despite this complex interplay with marked Bragg peaks in the
fluid structure, the fluid collective dynamics is shown to be accurately
described through De Gennes narrowing. Moreover, in contrast to the bulk fluid,
departure from De Gennes narrowing for the confined fluid in the macroscopic
limit remains small as the fluid/solid interactions in severe confinement
screen collective effects and, hence, weaken the wavevector dependence of
collective transport.

extract this key quantity from cosmological observations, two important
assumptions have to be made: i) a fiducial cosmological model, typically taken
to be the cosmological constant and cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model and
ii) the modeling of the observed power spectrum from H$\alpha$ emitters,
especially at non-linear scales, which is particularly dangerous as most models
used in the literature are phenomenological at best. In this work, we propose a
novel approach involving convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on the
Quijote N-body simulations, to predict $f\sigma_8(z)$ directly and without
assuming a model for the non-linear part of the power spectrum, thus avoiding
the second of the aforementioned assumptions. We find that the predictions for
the value of $f\sigma_8$ from the CNN are in excellent agreement with the
fiducial values, while the errors are within a factor of order unity from those
of the traditionally optimistic Fisher matrix approach, assuming an ideal
fiducial survey matching the specifications of the Quijote simulations. Thus,

  Hyperbolic Conservation Laws Near Critical States","23 pages, 26 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a modified version of conservative Physics-informed Neural
Networks (cPINN for short) is provided to construct the weak solutions of
Riemann problem for the hyperbolic scalar conservation laws in non-conservative
form. To demonstrate the results, we use the model of generalized
Buckley-Leverett equation (GBL equation for short) with discontinuous porosity
in porous media. By inventing a new unknown, the GBL equation is transformed
into a two-by-two resonant hyperbolic conservation laws in conservative form.
The modified method of cPINN is invented to overcome the difficulties due to
the discontinuity of the porosity and the appearance of the critical states
(near vacuum) in the Riemann data. We experiment with our idea by using a deep
learning algorithm to solve the GBL equation in both conservative and
non-conservative forms, as well as the cases of critical and non-critical
states. This method provides a combination of two different neural networks and
corresponding loss functions, one is for the two-by-two resonant hyperbolic
system, and the other is for the scalar conservation law with a discontinuous
perturbation term in the non-convex flux. The technique of re-scaling to the
unknowns is adopted to avoid the oscillation of the Riemann solutions in the
cases of critical Riemann data. The solutions constructed by the modified cPINN
match the exact solutions constructed by the theoretical analysis for
hyperbolic conservation laws. In addition, the solutions are identical in both
conservative and non-conservative cases. Finally, we compare the performance of
the modified cPINN with numerical method called WENO5. Whereas WENO5 struggles
with the highly oscillation of approximate solutions for the Riemann problems
of GBL equation in non-conservative form, cPINN works admirably.

colexification patterns of more than 2,000 concepts across 1,335 languages

our embeddings surpass several baselines in a transfer learning setting. This

industrial products on a conveyor belt. Real-time detection requires highly
accurate, robust, and fast algorithms to analyze X-ray images. Deep
convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) satisfy these requirements if a large
amount of labeled data is available. To overcome the challenge of collecting
these data, different methods of X-ray image generation can be considered.
Depending on the desired level of similarity to real data, various physical
effects either should be simulated or can be ignored. X-ray scattering is known
to be computationally expensive to simulate, and this effect can heavily
influence the accuracy of a generated X-ray image. We propose a methodology for
quantitative evaluation of the effect of scattering on defect detection. This
methodology compares the accuracy of DCNNs trained on different versions of the
same data that include and exclude the scattering signal. We use the
Probability of Detection (POD) curves to find the size of the smallest defect
that can be detected with a DCNN and evaluate how this size is affected by the
choice of training data. We apply the proposed methodology to a model problem
of defect detection in cylinders. Our results show that the exclusion of the
scattering signal from the training data has the largest effect on the smallest
detectable defects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accurate inspection is
more reliant on high-quality training data for images with a high quantity of
scattering. We discuss how the presented methodology can be used for other
tasks and objects.

prevent near object duplicates (caused by information of adjacent frames),
previous methods introduce a hyper-parameter that controls the frequency of

concrete video properties (such as rapidity of appearance changes and video

hazardous in safety-critical applications like automated driving. Adversarial
examples and defense strategies are well studied for the image classification
task, while there has been limited research in the context of semantic
segmentation. First works however show that the segmentation outcome can be
severely distorted by adversarial attacks. In this work, we introduce an
uncertainty-based method for the detection of adversarial attacks in semantic
segmentation. We observe that uncertainty as for example captured by the
entropy of the output distribution behaves differently on clean and perturbed
images using this property to distinguish between the two cases. Our method
works in a light-weight and post-processing manner, i.e., we do not modify the
model or need knowledge of the process used for generating adversarial
examples. In a thorough empirical analysis, we demonstrate the ability of our
approach to detect perturbed images across multiple types of adversarial

another advantage that is usually neglected in the literature, which is the

is the best one among all portfolios considered. The software is consumer

demonstrate how the software can be used using real-time series data for

understanding of the effectiveness of task arithmetic and its underlying

manifests when distinct directions in weight space govern separate, localized

Instead of the usual N-body simulation or Boltzmann solver, in this article we
consider a two-fluid framework at the linear scales, where the neutrino fluid
perturbations are coupled to the CDM (+ baryon) fluid via gravity at redshifts
of interest. Treating the neutrino mass fraction $f_\nu$ as a perturbative

reusing the historical promotion data to capture the promotional conversion
patterns. Herein, we propose a novel \textbf{H}istorical \textbf{D}ata
\textbf{R}euse (\textbf{HDR}) approach that first retrieves historically
similar promotion data and then fine-tunes the CVR prediction model with the
acquired data for better adaptation to the promotion mode. HDR consists of
three components: an automated data retrieval module that seeks similar data
from historical promotions, a distribution shift correction module that
re-weights the retrieved data for better aligning with the target promotion,
and a TransBlock module that quickly fine-tunes the original model for better
adaptation to the promotion mode. Experiments conducted with real-world data
demonstrate the effectiveness of HDR, as it improves both ranking and
calibration metrics to a large extent. HDR has also been deployed on the
display advertising system in Alibaba, bringing a lift of $9\%$ RPM and $16\%$

errors caused by homophonic or near-homophonic tokens that occur when
predicting multiple tokens separately. Experiments on Aishell and ST-cmds

wireless networks against a mobile eavesdropping UAV (E-UAV). To cope with the
mobility of the E-UAV, the proposed framework advocates the dual use of
artificial noise transmitted by the information UAV (I-UAV) for simultaneous
jamming and sensing to facilitate navigation and secure communication. In
particular, the I-UAV communicates with legitimate downlink ground users, while
avoiding potential information leakage by emitting jamming signals, and
estimates the state of the E-UAV with an extended Kalman filter based on the
backscattered jamming signals. Exploiting the estimated state of the E-UAV in
the previous time slot, the I-UAV determines its flight planning strategy,
predicts the wiretap channel, and designs its communication resource allocation
policy for the next time slot. To circumvent the severe coupling between these
three tasks, a divide-and-conquer approach is adopted. The online navigation
design has the objective to minimize the distance between the I-UAV and a
pre-defined destination point considering kinematic and geometric constraints.
Subsequently, given the predicted wiretap channel, the robust resource
allocation design is formulated as an optimization problem to achieve the
optimal trade-off between sensing and communication in the next time slot,
while taking into account the wiretap channel prediction error and the
quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of secure communication. Simulation
results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed design compared
with baseline schemes and validate the benefits of integrating sensing and
navigation into secure UAV communication systems.

collaboratively, e.g., for transportation, maintenance, search and rescue.
Coordination of such teams often involves two aspects: (i) selecting
appropriate sub-teams for different tasks; (ii) designing collaborative control
strategies to execute these tasks. The former aspect can be combinatorial
w.r.t. the team size, while the latter requires optimization over joint
state-spaces under geometric and dynamic constraints. Existing work often
tackles one aspect by assuming the other is given, while ignoring their close
dependency. This work formulates such problems as combinatorial-hybrid
optimizations (CHO), where both the discrete modes of collaboration and the
continuous control parameters are optimized simultaneously and iteratively. The
proposed framework consists of two interleaved layers: the dynamic formation of
task coalitions and the hybrid optimization of collaborative behaviors. Overall
feasibility and costs of different coalitions performing various tasks are
approximated at different granularities to improve the computational
efficiency. At last, a Nash-stable strategy for both task assignment and
execution is derived with provable guarantee on the feasibility and quality.
Two non-trivial applications of collaborative transportation and dynamic
capture are studied against several baselines.

proposal leads to a stronger holographic description, in which the full
spacetime is encoded on two screens at the cosmological horizons. At the
classical level, we find large degeneracies of minimal extremal homologous
surfaces, localized at the horizons, which can be lifted by quantum
corrections. The entanglement wedges of subregions of the screens exhibit
non-trivial behaviors, hinting at the existence of interesting phase
transitions and non-locality in the holographic theory. In particular, while
each screen encodes its corresponding static patch, we show that the
entanglement wedge of the screen with the larger quantum area extends and
covers the causal diamond between the screens, with a phase transition
occurring when the quantum areas of the screens become equal. We argue that the
capacity of the screens to encode the region between them is lost, when these
are pushed further in the static patches of the observers and placed on
stretched horizons.

realizing a sharing economy. This paper adopts an easy-to-implement greedy
matching algorithm with distributed fashion and only sub-linear O(log n)
parallel complexity (in user number n) for large-scale D2D sharing. Practical
cases indicate that the greedy matching's average performance is far better
than the worst-case approximation ratio 50% as compared to the optimum.
However, there is no rigorous average-case analysis in the literature to back
up such encouraging findings and this paper is the first to present such

we prove that our greedy algorithm performs better than 86.5% of the optimum.
For 2D grids, though dynamic programming cannot be directly applied, we still
prove this average performance ratio to be above 76%. For the more challenging
Erdos-Renyi random graphs, we equivalently reduce to the asymptotic analysis of
random trees and successfully prove a ratio up to 79%. Finally, we conduct

In this paper, we propose ``NAS-FM'', which adopts neural architecture search

automatically, achieving better results than handcrafted synthesizers. Audio

research community, with the goal of identifying facial manipulations for abuse
prevention. Although recent studies have focused on developing generalized
models that can detect various types of deepfakes, their performance is not
always be reliable and stable, which poses limitations in real-world
applications. Instead of learning a forgery detector, in this paper, we propose
a novel framework - Integrity Encryptor, aiming to protect portraits in a
proactive strategy. Our methodology involves covertly encoding messages that
are closely associated with key facial attributes into authentic images prior
to their public release. Unlike authentic images, where the hidden messages can
be extracted with precision, manipulating the facial attributes through
deepfake techniques can disrupt the decoding process. Consequently, the
modified facial attributes serve as a mean of detecting manipulated images
through a comparison of the decoded messages. Our encryption approach is
characterized by its brevity and efficiency, and the resulting method exhibits
a good robustness against typical image processing traces, such as image
degradation and noise. When compared to baselines that struggle to detect
deepfakes in a black-box setting, our method utilizing conditional encryption
showcases superior performance when presented with a range of different types
of forgeries. In experiments conducted on our protected data, our approach
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

minimum $\ell_2$ norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators.
However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to a simple
regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed
errors with zero mean and common variance, independent of the feature vectors.
Additionally, the main focus of these theoretical analyses has been on the
out-of-sample prediction risk. This paper breaks away from the existing
literature by examining the mean squared error of the ridgeless interpolation
least squares estimator, allowing for more general assumptions about the
regression errors. Specifically, we investigate the potential benefits of
overparameterization by characterizing the mean squared error in a finite
sample. Our findings reveal that including a large number of unimportant
parameters relative to the sample size can effectively reduce the mean squared
error of the estimator. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties
associated with the variance term can be summarized through the trace of the
variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors.

education settings, but a key barrier to their development is securing enough
data to train these models. Labelling educational data has traditionally relied
on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, making the process
expensive and difficult to scale. An alternative, more scalable approach could
be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, however,
maintaining sufficiently high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability
when using non-expert workers is challenging. This paper reports on two
experiments investigating using non-expert crowdworkers and comparative
judgement to evaluate complex student data. Crowdworkers were hired to evaluate
student responses to open-ended reading comprehension questions. Crowdworkers
were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were
asked to decide whether answers were correct or incorrect (i.e., a categorical
judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same question and
answers, but were instead asked to decide which of two candidate answers was
more correct (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that
using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on
both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the
benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as
well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where
comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human
feedback on model outputs when working with non-expert crowdworkers. However,
to our knowledge, these results are novel and important in demonstrating the
beneficial effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and
crowdworkers to evaluate educational data.

synthesize general audio given text descriptions. Previous methods utilized
latent diffusion models to learn audio embedding in a latent space with text
embedding as the condition. However, they ignored the synchronization between
audio and visual content in the video, and tended to generate audio mismatching
from video frames. In this work, we propose a novel and personalized
text-to-sound generation approach with visual alignment based on latent
diffusion models, namely DiffAVA, that can simply fine-tune lightweight
visual-text alignment modules with frozen modality-specific encoders to update
visual-aligned text embeddings as the condition. Specifically, our DiffAVA
leverages a multi-head attention transformer to aggregate temporal information
from video features, and a dual multi-modal residual network to fuse temporal
visual representations with text embeddings. Then, a contrastive learning
objective is applied to match visual-aligned text embeddings with audio
features. Experimental results on the AudioCaps dataset demonstrate that the
proposed DiffAVA can achieve competitive performance on visual-aligned
text-to-audio generation.

matrix is ``close'' to the identity matrix. Specifically, a lumped version of

the properties of two terms in linear autoencoders. Through the lens of
singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component analysis (PCA), it
is revealed that L2 regularization enhances the impact of high-ranked PCs.
Meanwhile, zero-diagonal constraints reduce the impact of low-ranked PCs,
leading to performance degradation for unpopular items. Inspired by this
analysis, we propose simple-yet-effective linear autoencoder models using
diagonal inequality constraints, called Relaxed Linear AutoEncoder (RLAE) and
Relaxed Denoising Linear AutoEncoder (RDLAE). We prove that they generalize
linear autoencoders by adjusting the degree of diagonal constraints.
Experimental results demonstrate that our models are comparable or superior to

significantly improve the accuracy of long-tail items. These results also

this paper, we propose methods to extract speaker-related information from
semantic content in multi-party meetings, which, as we will show, can further
benefit speaker diarization. We introduce two sub-tasks, Dialogue Detection and
Speaker-Turn Detection, in which we effectively extract speaker information

In this work, the thermal expansion paths, elastic, thermal and thermodynamic

first-principles based quasi-harmonic Debye-Gruneisen approach. A method
allowing avoids differentiation in many variables is used. The free energies
consisting of the electronic, vibrational and magnetic energy contributions,
calculated along different paths of thermal expansions were compared between
themselves. A path with the least free energy was chosen as the trajectory of
thermal expansion. Negative thermal expansion of the Fe7Mo6 compound was
predicted, while the Fe23Mo16 has a conventional thermal expansion and negative
TEC in the parameter c. The thermal expansions of both these compounds are not
isotropic. The elastic constants, modulus, heat capacities, Curie and Debye
temperatures were predicted. The obtained results satisfactorily agree with the
available experimental data. Physical factors affecting the stability of
Fe23Mo16 and Fe7Mo6 have been studied. The paper presents an essential feature
of thermal expansions of the Mu-phase of the Fe-Mo system, which can provide an

GraFITi improves the forecasting accuracy by up to 17% and reduces the run time

process governed by an Ito stochastic differential equation (SDE). In the
framework of a nominal white-noise model, the SDE is driven by a standard
Wiener process. For a scenario of statistical uncertainty, where the driving
noise acquires a state-dependent drift and thus deviates from its idealised
model, we consider the perturbation of the invariant probability density
function (PDF) as a steady-state solution of the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov
equation. We discuss an upper bound on a logarithmic Dirichlet form for the
ratio of the invariant PDF to its nominal counterpart in terms of the
Kullback-Leibler relative entropy rate of the actual noise distribution with
respect the Wiener measure. This bound is shown to be achievable, provided the
PDF ratio is preserved by the nominal steady-state probability flux. The
logarithmic Dirichlet form bound is used in order to obtain an upper bound on
the relative entropy of the perturbed invariant PDF in terms of
quadratic-exponential moments of the noise drift in the uniform ellipticity
case. These results are illustrated for perturbations of Gaussian invariant
measures in linear stochastic systems involving linear noise drifts.

learning rate (step size) schedules can significantly improve the convergence

size adaptively becomes an important research question. A popular and effective
method is the Polyak step size, which sets step size adaptively for gradient
descent or stochastic gradient descent without the need to estimate the
smoothness parameter of the objective function. However, there has not been a
principled way to generalize the Polyak step size for algorithms with momentum
accelerations. This paper presents a general framework to set the learning rate
adaptively for first-order optimization methods with momentum, motivated by the
derivation of Polyak step size. It is shown that the resulting methods are much
less sensitive to the choice of momentum parameter and may avoid the
oscillation of the heavy-ball method on ill-conditioned problems. These
adaptive step sizes are further extended to the stochastic settings, which are
attractive choices for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Our methods

  Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL) allows a large number of clients to collaboratively
train machine learning (ML) models by sending only their local gradients to a
central server for aggregation in each training iteration, without sending
their raw training data. Unfortunately, recent attacks on FL demonstrate that
local gradients may leak information about local training data. In response to
such attacks, Bonawitz \textit{et al.} (CCS 2017) proposed a secure aggregation
protocol that allows a server to compute the sum of clients' local gradients in
a secure manner. However, their secure aggregation protocol requires at least 4
rounds of communication between each client and the server in each training
iteration. The number of communication rounds is closely related not only to
the total communication cost but also the ML model accuracy, as the number of
communication rounds affects client dropouts.
  In this paper, we propose FSSA, a 3-round secure aggregation protocol, that
is efficient in terms of computation and communication, and resilient to client
dropouts. We prove the security of FSSA in honest-but-curious setting and show
that the security can be maintained even if an arbitrarily chosen subset of
clients drop out at any time. We evaluate the performance of FSSA and show that
its computation and communication overhead remains low even on large datasets.
Furthermore, we conduct an experimental comparison between FSSA and Bonawitz
\textit{et al.}'s protocol. The comparison results show that, in addition to
reducing the number of communication rounds, FSSA achieves a significant
improvement in computational efficiency.

  filtering and retrofiltering are classical","20 Pages, 9 Figures. Comments are welcomed!",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State smoothing is a technique to estimate a state at a particular time,
conditioned on information obtained both before (past) and after (future) that
time. For a classical system, the smoothed state is a normalized product of the
$\textit{filtered state}$ (a state conditioned only on the past measurement
information and the initial preparation) and the $\textit{retrofiltered
effect}$ (depending only on the future measurement information). For the
quantum case, whilst there are well-established analogues of the filtered state
($\rho_{\rm F}$) and retrofiltered effect ($\hat E_{\rm R}$), their product
does not, in general, provide a valid quantum state for smoothing. However,
this procedure does seem to work when $\rho_{\rm F}$ and $\hat E_{\rm R}$ are
mutually diagonalizable. This fact has been used to obtain smoothed quantum
states -- more pure than the filtered states -- in a number of experiments on
continuously monitored quantum systems, in cavity QED and atomic systems. In
this paper we show that there is an implicit assumption underlying this
technique: that if all the information were known to the observer, the true
system state would be one of the diagonal basis states. This assumption does
not necessarily hold, as the missing information is quantum information. It
could be known to the observer only if it were turned into a classical
measurement record, but then its nature depends on the choice of measurement.
We show by a simple model that, depending on that measurement choice, the

  Results show NCAs are able to grow into multiple distinct forms based on

than the emitting wavelength in the visible range is the high lasing thresholds
and the resulting overheating. Here we exploit exciton-polariton condensation
and mirror-image Mie modes in a cuboid CsPbBr$_3$ nanoparticle to achieve
coherent emission at the visible wavelength of around 0.53~$\mu $m from its
ultra-small ($\approx$0.007$\mu$m$^3$ or $\approx\lambda^3$/20) semiconductor
nanocavity. The polaritonic nature of the emission from the nanocavity
localized in all three dimensions is proven by direct comparison with
corresponding one-dimensional and two-dimensional waveguiding systems with
similar material parameters. Such a deeply subwavelength nanolaser is enabled
not only by the high values for exciton binding energy ($\approx$35 meV),
refractive index ($>$2.5 at low temperature), and luminescence quantum yield of
CsPbBr$_3$, but also by the optimization of polaritons condensation on the Mie
resonances. Moreover, the key parameters for optimal lasing conditions are
intermode free spectral range and phonons spectrum in CsPbBr$_3$, which govern
polaritons condensation path. Such chemically synthesized colloidal CsPbBr$_3$
nanolasers can be easily deposited on arbitrary surfaces, which makes them a

we study sequent calculi operating on graphs, as a generalization of sequent

  We mostly focus on sequent systems with multiplicative rules (in the sense of
linear logic, that is, linear and context-free rules) extending multiplicative
linear logic with connectives allowing us to represent modular decomposition of
graphs by formulas, therefore obtaining a representation of a graph with linear
size with respect to the number of its vertices. We show that these proof
systems satisfy basic proof theoretical properties such as initial coherence,
cut-elimination and analyticity of proof search. We prove that the system
conservatively extend multiplicative linear logic with and without mix, and
that the system extending the former derives the same graphs which are
derivable in the deep inference system GS from the literature. We provide a
syntax for proof nets for our systems by extending the syntax of Retor\'e's
RB-structures to represent graphical connectives. A topological
characterization of those structures encoding correct proofs is given, as well

equivalent to an eddy-viscosity model in Large Eddy Simulation. Three indicator
functions are considered: a constant function (leading to a linear filter), a
function proportional to the norm of the velocity gradient (recovering a
Smagorinsky-like model), and a function based on approximate deconvolution
operators. Through well-known benchmarks for atmospheric flow, we show that the

field dark matter (SFDM) cosmologies in the Thomas-Fermi regime, aka
``SFDM-TF"", where a strong repulsive 2-particle self-interaction (SI) is
included, being a valuable alternative to CDM, with the potential to resolve
its ``cusp-core"" problem. In general, SFDM behaves like a quantum fluid.
Previous literature has presented two fluid approximations for SFDM-TF, as well
as simulations of halo formation. These results confirmed earlier expectations
and are generally in mutual agreement, but discrepancies were also reported.
Therefore, we perform dedicated 3D cosmological simulations for the SFDM-TF
model, applying both fluid approximations, as well as for CDM. Our results are
very well in accordance with previous works and extend upon them, in that we
can explain the reported discrepancies as a result of different simulation
setups. We find some interesting details: The evolution of both SFDM-TF and CDM
halos follows a 2-stage process. In the early stage, the density profile in the
center becomes close to a $(n=1.5)$-polytropic core, dominated by an
""effective"" velocity-dispersion pressure $P_{\sigma}$ which is common to both
dark matter models. Consecutively, for CDM halos, the core transitions into a
central cusp. In SFDM-TF halos, the additional pressure $P_\text{SI}$ due to SI
determines the second stage of the evolution, where the central region follows
closely a $(n=1)$-polytropic core, embedded in a nearly isothermal envelope,
i.e. the outskirts are similar to CDM. We also encounter a new effect, namely a
late-time expansion of both polytropic core plus envelope, because the size of
the almost isothermal halo envelope is affected by the expansion of the
background universe. So, an initial primordial core of $\sim 100$ pc can evolve
into a larger core of $\gtrsim 1$ kpc, even without feedback from baryons.

perceive its environment. Much of the data that needs to be processed is
collected by optical sensors such as cameras. Unfortunately, the data collected
in this way can be affected by a variety of factors, including environmental
influences such as inclement weather conditions (e.g., rain). Such noisy data
can cause autonomous agents to take wrong decisions with potentially fatal
outcomes. This paper addresses the rain image challenge by two steps: First,
rain is artificially added to a set of clear-weather condition images using a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). This yields good/bad weather image pairs
for training de-raining models. This artificial generation of rain images is
sufficiently realistic as in 7 out of 10 cases, human test subjects believed
the generated rain images to be real. In a second step, this paired good/bad
weather image data is used to train two rain denoising models, one based
primarily on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the other using a Vision
Transformer. This rain de-noising step showed limited performance as the
quality gain was only about 15%. This lack of performance on realistic rain
images as used in our study is likely due to current rain de-noising models
being developed for simplistic rain overlay data. Our study shows that there is
ample space for improvement of de-raining models in autonomous driving.

$(P,Q)$ on a Hilbert $C^*$-module $H$ is introduced, in which $P$ is a
projection, while $Q$ is an idempotent satisfying certain conditions. Some
basic properties of quasi-projection pairs are provided. For every idempotent
$Q$ on a Hilbert $C^*$-module $H$, it is shown that there always exist a
projection denoted by $m(Q)$, and an invertible operator $W$ on $H$ such that
$\big(m(Q),Q\big)$ is a quasi-projection pair satisfying
\begin{equation*}Q=W^{-1}PW\quad\mbox{and}\quad \|I-W\|<1. \end{equation*}
Thus, a new formula for $Q$ is derived based on $m(Q)$, which is called the
matched projection of $Q$. The matched projection $m(Q)$ introduced in this
paper for a general idempotent $Q$ is a brand new object, which has many
interesting features. Some fundamental results on $m(Q)$ are derived. The new
terms of semi-harmonious quasi-projection pair and harmonious quasi-projection
pair are introduced respectively. A systematical characterization of these two
types of quasi-projection pairs is carried out in this paper. As applications,
the canonical $2\times 2$ block matrix representation and the $6\times 6$
Halmos-like block matrix representation are derived in the sense of unitary
equivalence for a general harmonious quasi-projection pair $(P,Q)$ on a Hilbert

$H$ is a Hilbert space). In addition, this paper initiates the study of the
common similarity and the unitary equivalence of operators in the framework of
semi-harmonious quasi-projection pairs. Some other topics such as a norm

method exhibits obvious block artifacts; second, the denoiser in the LDAMP is
too simple, and existing denoisers have limited ability in detail recovery. In
this paper, to overcome the issues and develop a high-performance LDAMP method
for image block compressed sensing (BCS), we propose a novel sparsity and
coefficient permutation-based AMP (SCP-AMP) method consisting of the
block-based sampling and the two-domain reconstruction modules. In the sampling
module, SCP-AMP adopts a discrete cosine transform (DCT) based sparsity
strategy to reduce the impact of the high-frequency coefficient on the
reconstruction, followed by a coefficient permutation strategy to avoid block
artifacts. In the reconstruction module, a two-domain AMP method with DCT
domain noise correction and pixel domain denoising is proposed for iterative

multi-level features and multiple attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that the proposed SCP-AMP method achieved better reconstruction

such as a semantic textual similarity (STS) task. However, sentence
representations as a point in a vector space can express only a part of the
diverse information that sentences have, such as asymmetrical relationships
between sentences. This paper proposes GaussCSE, a Gaussian distribution-based
contrastive learning framework for sentence embedding that can handle
asymmetric relationships between sentences, along with a similarity measure for
identifying inclusion relations. Our experiments show that GaussCSE achieves
the same performance as previous methods in natural language inference tasks,
and is able to estimate the direction of entailment relations, which is
difficult with point representations.

continuous dimension: functional data. In this paper, we introduce the funLOCI
algorithm which allows to identify functional local clusters or functional
loci, i.e., subsets/groups of functions exhibiting similar behaviour across the
same continuous subset of the domain. The definition of functional local
clusters leverages ideas from multivariate and functional clustering and
biclustering and it is based on an additive model which takes into account the
shape of the curves. funLOCI is a three-step algorithm based on divisive
hierarchical clustering. The use of dendrograms allows to visualize and to
guide the searching procedure and the cutting thresholds selection. To deal
with the large quantity of local clusters, an extra step is implemented to
reduce the number of results to the minimum.

interest to be expected values of functions of random variables via stochastic
differential equations (SDEs). For SDEs with globally Lipschitz coefficients
and commutative diffusion coefficients, the explicit Milstein scheme, relying
on only Brownian increments and thus easily implementable, can be combined with
the multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method proposed by Giles
\cite{giles2008multilevel} to give the optimal overall computational cost
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the required target accuracy.
For multi-dimensional SDEs that do not satisfy the commutativity condition, a
kind of one-half order truncated Milstein-type scheme without L\'evy areas is
introduced by Giles and Szpruch \cite{giles2014antithetic}, which combined with
the antithetic MLMC gives the optimal computational cost under globally
Lipschitz conditions. In the present work, we turn to SDEs with non-globally
Lipschitz continuous coefficients, for which a family of modified Milstein-type
schemes without L\'evy areas is proposed. The expected one-half order of strong
convergence is recovered in a non-globally Lipschitz setting, where the
diffusion coefficients are allowed to grow superlinearly. This helps us to
analyze the relevant variance of the multilevel estimator and the optimal
computational cost is finally achieved for the antithetic MLMC. The analysis of
both the convergence rate and the desired variance in the non-globally
Lipschitz setting is highly non-trivial and non-standard arguments are
developed to overcome some essential difficulties. Numerical experiments are
provided to confirm the theoretical findings.

round-trip protocol that slowly drives the system across a quantum first-order

single-passage protocol across the first-order transition have been previously
determined. Here, we show that such scaling relations persist when the driving
protocol is inverted and the transition is approached again by a
far-from-equilibrium state. This results in a quasi-universality of the scaling
functions, which keep some dependence on the details of the protocol at the
inversion time. We explicitly determine such quasi-universal scaling functions
by employing an effective two-level description of the many-body system near
the transition. We discuss the validity of this approximation and how this
relates to the observed scaling regime. Although our results apply to generic
systems, we focus on the prototypical example of a $1D$ transverse field Ising
model in the ferromagnetic regime, which we drive across the first-order
transitions through a time-dependent longitudinal field.

Learning allows us to completely avoid sharing information with a third-party

when compared to the server counterparts due to the fact that (1) they
typically only rely on a small set of on-device features and (2) they need to
be small enough to run efficiently on end-user devices. Split Learning (SL) is
a promising approach that can overcome these limitations. In SL, a large

requires exchanging gradients at the cut layer, which might encode private

adopts negative sampling in the objective function to minimize the
unlikelihood. During inference, the BTR gives final results after comparing the
reranked top-1 results with the original ones by an acceptance threshold.
Experimental results show that, in reranking candidates from a pre-trained
seq2seq model, T5-base, the BTR on top of T5-base could yield 65.47 and 71.27

the best of our knowledge, the effectiveness of TAPT in SSL tasks has not been

static, spherically symmetric vacuum solution within this theory. The solution
is spatially Schwarzschild-de Sitter, with the value of the cosmological
constant determined by the graviton mass and the interaction parameters of the
theory. Notably, for specific parameter ranges, the solution represents a
traversable Lorentzian wormhole that violates the weak energy condition near
its throat. Furthermore, we have investigated the evolution of scalar and
electromagnetic fields in this wormhole spacetime and observed the presence of
arbitrarily long-lived quasi-resonant modes in the quasinormal spectrum.

  semi-structured interviews? An exploration and provocation on the limits of
  the approach and the model",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful generative Artificial
Intelligence solutions which can be applied to several fields and areas of
work. This paper presents results and reflection of an experiment done to use
the model GPT 3.5-Turbo to emulate some aspects of an inductive Thematic
Analysis. Previous research on this subject has largely worked on conducting
deductive analysis. Thematic Analysis is a qualitative method for analysis
commonly used in social sciences and it is based on interpretations made by the
human analyst(s) and the identification of explicit and latent meanings in
qualitative data. Attempting an analysis based on human interpretation with an
LLM clearly is a provocation but also a way to learn something about how these
systems can or cannot be used in qualitative research. The paper presents the
motivations for attempting this emulation, it reflects on how the six steps to
a Thematic Analysis proposed by Braun and Clarke can at least partially be
reproduced with the LLM and it also reflects on what are the outputs produced
by the model. The paper used two existing datasets of open access
semi-structured interviews, previously analysed with Thematic Analysis by other
researchers. It used the previously produced analysis (and the related themes)
to compare with the results produced by the LLM. The results show that the
model can infer at least partially some of the main Themes. The objective of
the paper is not to replace human analysts in qualitative analysis but to learn
if some elements of LLM data manipulation can to an extent be of support for
qualitative research.

low-dimensional representations of entities and relations, enabling the
prediction of missing facts. A significant challenge in achieving better KG
embeddings lies in capturing relation patterns, including symmetry,
antisymmetry, inversion, commutative composition, non-commutative composition,
hierarchy, and multiplicity. This study introduces a novel model called 3H-TH

satisfactory performance across all the mentioned properties at the same time.
The experimental results demonstrate that the new model outperforms existing

(ICL) ability. However, the ICL models that can solve ordinary cases are hardly
extended to solve more complex tasks by processing the demonstration examples
once. This single-turn ICL is incoordinate with the decision making process of
humans by learning from analogy. In this paper, we propose an effective and
efficient two-stage framework to boost ICL in LLMs by exploiting a dual form
between Transformer attention and gradient descent-based optimization.
Concretely, we divide the ICL process into ""Deep-Thinking"" and inference
stages. The ""Deep-Thinking"" stage performs iterative forward optimization of
demonstrations, which is expected to boost the reasoning abilities of LLMs at
test time by ""thinking"" demonstrations multiple times. It produces accumulated
meta-gradients by manipulating the Key-Value matrices in the self-attention
modules of the Transformer. Then, the inference stage only takes the test query
as input without concatenating demonstrations and applies the learned
meta-gradients through attention for output prediction. In this way,
demonstrations are not required during the inference stage since they are
already learned and stored in the definitive meta-gradients. LLMs can be
effectively and efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
on ten classification and multiple-choice datasets show that our method
achieves substantially better performance than standard ICL in terms of both
accuracy and efficiency.

frustration. However, so far only model systems have been studied and the
lifetime of coexisting metastable topological spin structures has not been
obtained. Here, we predict that skyrmions and antiskyrmions with diameters
below 10 nm can coexist at zero magnetic field in a Rh/Co bilayer on the
Ir(111) surface -- an experimentally feasible system. We show that the

The entropic contribution to the nucleation and annihilation rates differs for

gradient-spoiled, gradient-echo sequence with a slowly varying RF flip-angle
train and Cartesian readouts, and the quantitative tissue maps are
reconstructed by an iterative, model-based optimization algorithm. In this
work, we design a 3D MR-STAT framework based on previous 2D work, in order to
achieve better image SNR, higher though-plan resolution and better tissue
characterization. Specifically, we design a 7-minute, high-resolution 3D
MR-STAT sequence, and the corresponding two-step reconstruction algorithm for
the large-scale dataset. To reduce the long acquisition time, Cartesian
undersampling strategies such as SENSE are adopted in our transient-state
quantitative framework. To reduce the computational burden, a data splitting
scheme is designed for decoupling the 3D reconstruction problem into
independent 2D reconstructions. The proposed 3D framework is validated by
numerical simulations, phantom experiments and in-vivo experiments.
High-quality knee quantitative maps with 0.8 x 0.8 x 1.5mm3 resolution and
bilateral lower leg maps with 1.6mm isotropic resolution can be acquired using
the proposed 7-minute acquisition sequence and the 3-minute-per-slice decoupled

clinical applications in the future.

constraints on the model parameters. Specifically, for the axion decay constant
$f_a=10^{16}~\mathrm{GeV}$, which potentially accounts for the seeds of the

abundance of SMBHs. On the other hand, for $f_a=10^{17}~\mathrm{GeV}$ required
to produce PBHs of masses detected in the LIGO/Virgo, the PBH fraction should
be $f_\mathrm{PBH}\lesssim6\times 10^{-8}$, which may be too small to explain

polarisation angle of $78\pm10$ degrees (errors are 1 sigma confidence). The
X-ray polarisation is consistent with being aligned with the radio jet, albeit
partially due to large uncertainties on the radio position angle. We jointly
fit the spectra from the three observatories to constrain the presence of a
relativistic reflection component. From this, we obtain constraints on the
inclination angle to the inner disc (< 39 degrees at 99 per cent confidence)
and the disc inner radius (< 11 gravitational radii at 99 per cent confidence),

statistical error. Our spectro-polarimetric modelling indicates that the 2-8
keV polarisation is consistent with being dominated by emission directly
observed from the X-ray corona, but the polarisation of the reflection
component is completely unconstrained. Our constraints on viewer inclination
and polarisation degree tentatively favour more asymmetric, possibly
out-flowing, coronal geometries that produce more highly polarised emission,

with recent assertions that bag filters have a high removal efficiency for
ufps. An analysis of fiber filter retention based on the fundamental mechanisms
for the deposition of small particles to single filter fibers and their
dependence on particle size, shows that whilst the removal efficiency is 100 %
for particles << . 1 micron, there is a minimum of the filter retention
efficiency in the region 0.05 to 0.5 microns where the concentration of the

powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace;
however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain
gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target
(i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually
unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in
RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an
approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of
demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for
utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be
easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us
with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and
generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments,
using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between
the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved
a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared
with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional
football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful
performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target
environments than the chase-and-escape task.

Transformers are more robust than CNNs and show that this is related to the
visual grouping property of self-attention. In this work, we propose a novel
hierarchical grouping transformer (HGFormer) to explicitly group pixels to form
part-level masks and then whole-level masks. The masks at different scales aim
to segment out both parts and a whole of classes. HGFormer combines mask
classification results at both scales for class label prediction. We assemble
multiple interesting cross-domain settings by using seven public semantic
segmentation datasets. Experiments show that HGFormer yields more robust
semantic segmentation results than per-pixel classification methods and flat
grouping transformers, and outperforms previous methods significantly. Code

and efficiency ratings as defined by Oliver (2004). The paper introduces an
equation showing how a team's four factors in conjunction with its field goal
and free throw percentages can be used to calculate its offensive rating.
Moreover, the substitution of defensive four factors into the equation allows
for the calculation of defensive and net ratings. To incorporate recent trends
in the NBA, the paper updates the estimation for the relative frequency of
possession-ending free throws which are needed to estimate the number of
possessions from box score data. Sensitivity analysis of the offensive rating
is performed in order to better understand the relative importance of the four
factors. By examining partial derivatives of the offensive rating, the paper
quantifies the marginal impact of small changes in the offensive and defensive
four factors on offensive, defensive, and net ratings. Most importantly it is
observed that the relationship between the four factors and efficiency ratings
is non-linear and the individual factors' effect on the ratings depends on the
values of the other factors. The paper also includes examples from NBA seasons
spanning 1996-97 through 2022-23.

data. To address this problem, we propose a graph-attention-based personalized
training algorithm (GATTA) for distributed deep learning. The GATTA enables
each agent to train its local personalized model while exploiting its
correlation with neighboring nodes and utilizing their useful information for
aggregation. In particular, the personalized model in each agent is composed of
a global part and a node-specific part. By treating each agent as one node in a
graph and the node-specific parameters as its features, the benefits of the
graph attention mechanism can be inherited. Namely, instead of aggregation
based on averaging, it learns the specific weights for different neighboring
nodes without requiring prior knowledge about the graph structure or the
neighboring nodes' data distribution. Furthermore, relying on the
weight-learning procedure, we develop a communication-efficient GATTA by
skipping the transmission of information with small aggregation weights.
Additionally, we theoretically analyze the convergence properties of GATTA for
non-convex loss functions. Numerical results validate the excellent
performances of the proposed algorithms in terms of convergence and

transferability of SRSH functionals to several prototypical van der Waals

quasiparticle energies of these extremal structural phases as fitting targets.
The resulting SRSH functionals can describe both electronic bandstructures and
optical absorption spectra with accuracy comparable to more demanding ab initio

server in a distributed fashion. A graph is used to locally balance the load by
dispatching every incoming task to one of the shortest queues in the
neighborhood where the task appears. In order to globally balance the load, the
neighborship relations are constantly renewed by resampling the graph at rate
$\mu_n$ from some fixed random graph law. We derive the fluid limit of the
occupancy process as $n \to \infty$ and $\mu_n \to \infty$ when the resampling
procedure is symmetric with respect to the servers. The maximum degree of the
graph may remain bounded as $n$ grows and the total number of arrivals between
consecutive resampling times may approach infinity. The fluid limit only
depends on the random graph laws through their limiting degree distribution and
can be interpreted as a generalized power-of-$(d + 1)$ scheme where $d$ is
random and has the limiting degree distribution. We use the fluid limit to
obtain valuable insights into the performance impact and optimal design of
sparse dynamic graphs with a bounded average degree. In particular, we
establish a phase transition in performance when the probability that a server
is isolated switches from zero to positive, and we show that performance
improves as the degree distribution becomes more concentrated.

this paper we try to understand this by designing a benchmark to evaluate

effective structural prompting, e.g., critical value / range identification

prediction, Hierarchical Partitioning Forecasters (HPFs). Our goal is to
provide appealing theoretical - regret guarantees on a powerful model class -

the feature space into sub-spaces, blending forecasters specialized to each
sub-space and learning HPFs via local online learning applied to these
individual forecasters. Following these principles allows us to obtain regret
guarantees, where Constant Partitioning Forecasters (CPFs) serve as competitor.
A CPF partitions the feature space into sub-spaces and predicts with a fixed
forecaster per sub-space. Fixing a hierarchical partition $\mathcal H$ and
considering any CPF with a partition that can be constructed using elements of
$\mathcal H$ we provide two guarantees: first, a generic one that unveils how
local online learning determines regret of learning the entire HPF online;
second, a concrete instance that considers HPF with linear forecasters (LHPF)
and exp-concave losses where we obtain $O(k \log T)$ regret for sequences of

Here, we find a quantity that does decrease monotonically throughout GD
training: the sharpness attained by the gradient flow solution (GFS)-the
solution that would be obtained if, from now until convergence, we train with
an infinitesimal step size. Theoretically, we analyze scalar neural networks
with the squared loss, perhaps the simplest setting where the EoS phenomena
still occur. In this model, we prove that the GFS sharpness decreases
monotonically. Using this result, we characterize settings where GD provably

  Flow",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Local differential privacy (LDP) is a variant of differential privacy (DP)
that avoids the need for a trusted central curator, at the cost of a worse
trade-off between privacy and utility. The shuffle model is a way to provide
greater anonymity to users by randomly permuting their messages, so that the
link between users and their reported values is lost to the data collector. By
combining an LDP mechanism with a shuffler, privacy can be improved at no cost
for the accuracy of operations insensitive to permutations, thereby improving
utility in many tasks. However, the privacy implications of shuffling are not
always immediately evident, and derivations of privacy bounds are made on a
case-by-case basis.
  In this paper, we analyze the combination of LDP with shuffling in the
rigorous framework of quantitative information flow (QIF), and reason about the
resulting resilience to inference attacks. QIF naturally captures randomization
mechanisms as information-theoretic channels, thus allowing for precise
modeling of a variety of inference attacks in a natural way and for measuring
the leakage of private information under these attacks. We exploit symmetries
of the particular combination of k-RR mechanisms with the shuffle model to
achieve closed formulas that express leakage exactly. In particular, we provide
formulas that show how shuffling improves protection against leaks in the local
model, and study how leakage behaves for various values of the privacy
parameter of the LDP mechanism.
  In contrast to the strong adversary from differential privacy, we focus on an
uninformed adversary, who does not know the value of any individual in the
dataset. This adversary is often more realistic as a consumer of statistical
datasets, and we show that in some situations mechanisms that are equivalent
w.r.t. the strong adversary can provide different privacy guarantees under the
uninformed one.

bi-level contrastive learning method over multiple prototypes. The proposed
method is composed of two reciprocally enhanced parts. First, a bi-level
contrastive learning method is introduced, which maintains the pair-wise
similarity of the prototypes and the prototype group levels for better
representation learning. Then, a reliable prototype similarity metric is
proposed based on the common representing instances. Prototypes with high
similarities will be grouped progressively for known class recognition and
novel class discovery. Extensive experiments on three image datasets are
conducted and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in
open-world scenarios, especially with scarce known classes and labels.

polarization to stress or its strain to an applied field. Using in-operando
x-ray Bragg coherent diffraction imaging, we observe that topological vortices
are the source of a five-fold enhancement of the piezoelectric response near
the vortex core. The vortices form where several low symmetry ferroelectric
phases and phase boundaries coalesce. Unlike bulk ferroelectric solid solutions
in which a large piezoelectric response is associated with coexisting phases in
the proximity of the triple point, the largest responses for pure BaTiO3 at the
nanoscale are in spatial regions of extremely small spontaneous polarization at
vortex cores. The response decays inversely with polarization away from the
vortex, analogous to the behavior in bulk ceramics as the cation compositions
are varied away from the triple point. We use first-principles-based molecular
dynamics to augment our observations, and our results suggest that nanoscale
piezoelectric materials with large piezoelectric response can be designed
within a parameter space governed by vortex cores. Our findings have
implications for the development of next-generation nanoscale piezoelectric

kinematics are consistent with Keplerian rotation and low turbulent speeds. The
inferred central mass is 17 million solar masses. On the basis of disk
stability arguments, the mass of the molecular disk is roughly 110 thousand
solar masses. The disk masers further resolve into filamentary structures

polarization with systematic uncertainties better than
$\sigma^\text{syst}_P/P\le1\%$. Recently, it was proposed that the Polarized
Atomic Hydrogen Gas Jet Target (HJET) be utilized for the precision measurement
of the polarization of the $\sim$100 GeV/n helion beam. At the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider, HJET serves to determine the absolute proton beam
polarization with low systematic uncertainties of about
$\delta^\text{syst}P/P\lesssim0.5\%$. To adapt the HJET method for the EIC
helion beam, the experimentally determined ratio of the beam and target (jet)
spin-correlated asymmetries should be adjusted by the ratio of $p^\uparrow{h}$
and $h^\uparrow{p}$ analyzing powers. A potential problem with the suggested
method is that the breakup of $^3$He in polarization measurements could
drastically affect the analyzing power ratio. However, an analysis of the
breakup corrections, presented in this paper, reveals that while these
corrections can be as substantial as $\sim$4\%, the effect cancels out to a
negligible level in the measured beam polarization.

cocktail party problem: the detection of a weak periodic stimulus in the

the periodic signal to be detected. Specifically, we study the response of a
population of stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to two periodic
signals and focus in particular on the question, whether the presence of one of
the stimuli can be detected from the population activity. As a detection
criterion, we use a simple threshold-crossing of the population activity over a

the detection of the weak periodic signal can be facilitated by the presence of
a strong periodic input current depending on the frequencies of the two signals

simulations of the model we present an analytical approximation for the ROC
curve that is based on the weakly nonlinear-response theory for a stochastic
LIF neuron. We discuss the validity of this approximation as well as the

necessary adjustment that will eliminate the requirement for interleaving and
reduce decoding latency. This paper suggests a coding and decoding system that,
combined with the high spectral efficiency of spatial multiplexing, can provide
URLLC over a fading wireless channel. Random linear codes (RLCs) are used over
a block-fading massive multiple input-multiple-output (mMIMO) channel followed
by zero-forcing (ZF) detection and guessing random additive noise decoding
(GRAND). A variation of GRAND, called symbol-level GRAND, originally proposed
for single-antenna systems, is generalized to spatial multiplexing.
Symbol-level GRAND is much more computationally effective than bit-level GRAND
as it takes advantage of the structure of the constellation of the modulation.
The paper analyses the performance of symbol-level GRAND depending on the
orthogonality defect (OD) of the underlying lattice. Symbol-level GRAND takes
advantage of the a priori probability of each error pattern given a received
symbol, and specifies the order in which error patterns are tested. The paper
further proposes to make use of further side-information that comes from the
mMIMO channel-state information (CSI) and its impacts on the reliability of
each antenna. This induces an antenna sorting order that further reduces the
decoding complexity by over 80 percent when comparing with bit-level GRAND.

existence of a trade-off between the rate and the perceptual quality has been
brought to light, where the perception is measured by the closeness of the
output distribution to the source. This leads to the question: how does a
perception constraint impact the trade-off between the rate and traditional
distortion constraints, typically quantified by a single-letter distortion
measure? We consider the compression of a memoryless source $X$ in the presence
of memoryless side information $Z,$ studied by Wyner and Ziv, but elucidate the
impact of a perfect realism constraint, which requires the output distribution
to match the source distribution. We consider two cases: when $Z$ is available
only at the decoder or at both the encoder and the decoder. The rate-distortion
trade-off with perfect realism is characterized for sources on general
alphabets when infinite common randomness is available between the encoder and
the decoder. We show that, similarly to traditional source coding with side

  pencils","22 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The numerical solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem for a singular
matrix pencil is challenging due to the discontinuity of its eigenvalues.
Classically, such problems are addressed by first extracting the regular part
through the staircase form and then applying a standard solver, such as the QZ
algorithm. Recently, several novel approaches have been proposed to transform
the singular pencil into a regular pencil by relatively simple randomized
modifications. In this work, we analyze three such methods by Hochstenbach,
Mehl, and Plestenjak that modify, project, or augment the pencil using random
matrices. All three methods rely on the normal rank and do not alter the finite
eigenvalues of the original pencil. In this work we analyze these methods and
show that the eigenvalue condition numbers of the transformed pencils are
unlikely to be much larger than the $\delta$-weak eigenvalue condition numbers,
introduced by Lotz and Noferini, of the original pencil. This not only
indicates favorable numerical stability but also shows that these condition
numbers are a reliable criterion for detecting finite eigenvalues. We also
provide evidence that, from a numerical stability perspective, the use of
complex instead of real random matrices is preferable even for real singular
matrix pencils and real eigenvalues.

probabilities obtained at the end of the model are inadequate to quantify
uncertainty. Then, we examine the capability of capturing data and model
uncertainties by the model with the selected UE score on well-designed test

performance of full annotation NER models. Results: To address this problem, we
systematically study the effectiveness of partial annotation learning methods
for biomedical entity recognition over different simulated scenarios of missing

displacement discontinuity method, and the optimization is realized by a
conjugate gradient method. The performance of the inversion algorithm is
demonstrated using a synthetic case, in which the fracture half-length
evolution and propagation velocity match well with the reference solutions.
Additionally, the averaged fracture cross-section area, fracture volume, and
fracturing fluid efficiency can also be estimated, showing good agreements with
true values of the synthetic case under reasonable assumptions. Then a field

evidenced by the fracture half-length evolution. This unique field evidence can
guide modeling efforts to incorporate this important physical behavior into

This intrinsically non-Hermitian topological invariant is distinct from the
Chern number invariant of the bulk (which remains intact) and induces mode
localization via the ""non-Hermitian skin effect"". The interplay of the two
topological phenomena - the Chern number and point-gap winding - gives rise to
a non-Hermitian generalisation of the paradigmatic Chern-type bulk-boundary
correspondence principle. Compared to previous realisations of the
non-Hermitian skin effect, the skin modes in this system have superior
robustness against local defects and disorders.

\textbf{A}lignment-then-Denoising (SGA) approach to adapt an encoder to a
multilingual generator with a small number of new parameters. Experiments show
that the proposed approach is an effective adaption method, outperforming
widely-used initialization-based methods with gains of 9.4 BLEU on machine

still inferior to mBART in supervised settings despite better results on
zero-shot settings, indicating that more exploration is required to make

$\mathrm{^3P_1} \rightarrow \mathrm{^3P_0}$ fine structure line at projected
distances of up to 78"" from the star. The line profiles are characterized by
both direct fitting of Gaussian components, and by modeling the observed line
of the [CI] triplet. We also report the detection of the $\mathrm{^2P_{3/2}}

central position and at 32"" from the star. Results: The overall picture of the
[CI] emission from IRC +10216 agrees with more limited previous studies. The
satisfying agreement between the observed and modeled line profiles, with
emission at the systemic velocity appearing beyond one beam from the star,
rules out that the C0 is located in a thin shell. Given that the bond energy of
CO falls only 0.1 eV below the ionization threshold of C0, the absence of
observable [CII] emission from sightlines beyond a projected distance of $\sim
10^{17}$ cm from the star (adopting a distance of 130 pc) does not contradict a
scenario where the bulk of C0 is located between that of CO and C+, as expected
for an external FUV radiation field. This conjecture is also corroborated by a
model in which the C0 shell is located farther outside, failing to reproduce
the [CI] line profiles at intermediate sky-plane distances from the star.
Comparing a photo-chemical model adopted from literature with the simplifying
assumption of a constant C0 abundance with respect to the $\mathrm{H}_2$
density, we constrain the inner boundary of the [CI] emitting shell, located at
$\sim 10^{16}$ cm from the star.

believed to be the emergence of anomalous active regions which do not obey

high magnetic flux that disproportionately impact the polar field are sometimes
referred to as ""rogue regions"". In this study -- utilizing a surface flux
transport model -- we analyze the large-scale dipole moment build-up due to the
emergence of anomalous active regions on the solar surface. Although these
active regions comprise a small fraction of the total sunspot number, they can
substantially influence the magnetic dipole moment build-up and subsequent
solar cycle amplitude. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the impact of

$x \in [q\rangle$ is an input to the node and $t \in [q\rangle$ is a node

  Such mappings are presented for various comparison families, as well as for

sensitivity between 2.7 and 50 x 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$ over 25 km s$^{-1}$ for

(ETDs). The HI-detected LTDs have likely just joined the cluster and are on
their first infall as they are located at large clustocentric radii, with
comparable MHI and mean stellar surface brightness at fixed luminosity as blue,
star-forming LTDs in the field. The HI-detected ETDs have likely been in the
cluster longer than the LTDs and acquired their HI through a recent merger or
accretion from nearby HI. Eight of the HI-detected LTDs host irregular or
asymmetric HI emission and disturbed or lopsided stellar emission. There are
two clear cases of ram-pressure shaping the HI, with the LTDs displaying
compressed HI on the side closest to the cluster centre and a one-sided,
starless tail pointing away from the cluster centre. The HI-detected dwarfs
avoid the most massive potentials, consistent with massive galaxies playing an
active role in the removal of HI. We create a simple toy model to quantify the
timescale of HI stripping in the cluster. We find that a MHI = 10$^{8}$ Msun
dwarf will be stripped in ~ 240 Myr. The model is consistent with our
observations, where low mass LTDs are directly stripped of their HI from a
single encounter and more massive LTDs can harbour a disturbed HI morphology
due to longer times or multiple encounters being required to fully strip their
HI.

deep neural networks in the terminal phase of gradient descent training.
Recently, an increasing amount of experimental evidence has pointed to the
propagation of NC to earlier layers of neural networks. However, while the NC
in the last layer is well studied theoretically, much less is known about its
multi-layered counterpart - deep neural collapse (DNC). In particular, existing
work focuses either on linear layers or only on the last two layers at the
price of an extra assumption. Our paper fills this gap by generalizing the
established analytical framework for NC - the unconstrained features model - to
multiple non-linear layers. Our key technical contribution is to show that, in
a deep unconstrained features model, the unique global optimum for binary
classification exhibits all the properties typical of DNC. This explains the
existing experimental evidence of DNC. We also empirically show that (i) by
optimizing deep unconstrained features models via gradient descent, the
resulting solution agrees well with our theory, and (ii) trained networks
recover the unconstrained features suitable for the occurrence of DNC, thus
supporting the validity of this modeling principle.

for acceptable effluent discharge into surface water bodies. To turn this
bottleneck issue into an opportunity, this study developed oxygen-induced
thiosulfatE production duRing sulfATe reductiOn (EARTO) to provide an efficient
electron donor for wastewater treatment. Typical pretreated wastewater was
synthesized with chemical oxygen demand of 110 mg/L, sulfate of 50 mg S/L, and
varying dissolved oxygen (DO) and was fed into a moving-bed biofilm reactor
(MBBR). The MBBR was operated continuously with a short hydraulic retention
time of 40 min for 349 days. The formation rate of thiosulfate reached
0.12-0.18 g S/(m2.d) with a high produced thiosulfate-S/TdS-S ratio of 38-73%
when influent DO was 2.7-3.6 mg/L. The sludge yield was 0.23-0.29 gVSS/gCOD,
much lower than it was in conventional activated sludge processes. Then, batch
tests and metabolism analysis were conducted to confirm the oxygen effect on
thiosulfate formation, characterize the roles of sulfate and microbial
activities, and explore the mechanism of oxygen-induced thiosulfate formation
in ERATO. Results examined that oxygen supply promoted the
thiosulfate-Sproduced/TdS-Sproduced ratio from 4% to 24-26%, demonstrated that
sulfate and microbial activities were critical for thiosulfate production, and
indicated that oxygen induces thiosulfate formation through two pathways: 1)
direct sulfide oxidation, and 2) indirect sulfide oxidation, sulfide is first
oxidized to S0 (dominant) which then reacts with sulfite derived from
oxygen-regulated biological sulfate reduction. The proposed compact ERATO
process, featuring high thiosulfate production and low sludge production,
supports space- and energy-efficient secondary wastewater treatment.

pathways to fix atmospheric N2 must have been prominent to provide bioavailable
nitrogen to Earth's earliest ecosystems. Lightning has been shown to produce
fixed nitrogen as nitrite and nitrate in both modern atmospheres dominated by
N2 and O2 and atmospheres dominated by N2 and CO2 analogous to the Archaean
Earth. However, a better understanding of the isotopic fingerprints of
lightning-generated fixed nitrogen is needed to assess the role of this process
on the early Earth. Here, we present results from spark discharge experiments
in N2-CO2 and N2-O2 gas mixtures. Our experiments suggest that lightning-driven
nitrogen fixation may have been similarly efficient in the Archaean atmosphere,
compared to modern times. Measurements of the isotopic ratio {\delta}15N of the
discharge-produced nitrite and nitrate in solution show very low values of -6
to -15 permil after equilibration with the gas phase with a calculated
endmember composition of -17 permil. These results are much lower than most
{\delta}15N values documented from the sedimentary rock record, which supports
the development of biological nitrogen fixation earlier than 3.2 Ga. However,
some Paleoarchean records (3.7 Ga) may be consistent with lightning-derived
nitrogen input, highlighting the potential role of this process for the

structure-based drug design) is a fundamental and challenging task in drug
discovery. Recently, deep generative models have achieved remarkable success in
generating 3D molecules conditioned on the protein pocket. However, most
existing methods consider molecular generation for protein pockets
independently while neglecting the underlying connections such as
subpocket-level similarities. Subpockets are the local protein environments of
ligand fragments and pockets with similar subpockets may bind the same
molecular fragment (motif) even though their overall structures are different.
Therefore, the trained models can hardly generalize to unseen protein pockets
in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel method DrugGPS
for generalizable structure-based drug design. With the biochemical priors, we
propose to learn subpocket prototypes and construct a global interaction graph
to model the interactions between subpocket prototypes and molecular motifs.
Moreover, a hierarchical graph transformer encoder and motif-based 3D molecule
generation scheme are used to improve the model's performance. The experimental
results show that our model consistently outperforms baselines in generating
realistic drug candidates with high affinities in challenging
out-of-distribution settings.

training-efficient method for learning MCR without paired data called
Connecting Multi-modal Contrastive Representations (C-MCR). Specifically, given
two existing MCRs pre-trained on (A, B) and (B, C) modality pairs, we project
them to a new space and use the data from the overlapping modality B to
aligning the two MCRs in the new space. Meanwhile, since the modality pairs (A,
B) and (B, C) are already aligned within each MCR, the connection learned by
overlapping modality can also be transferred to non-overlapping modality pair
(A, C). To unleash the potential of C-MCR, we further introduce a
semantic-enhanced inter- and intra-MCR connection method. We first enhance the
semantic consistency and completion of embeddings across different modalities
for more robust alignment. Then we utilize the inter-MCR alignment to establish
the connection, and employ the intra-MCR alignment to better maintain the
connection for inputs from non-overlapping modalities. We take the field of
audio-visual contrastive learning as an example to demonstrate the
effectiveness of C-MCR. We connect pre-trained CLIP and CLAP models via texts
to derive audio-visual contrastive representations. Remarkably, without using
any paired audio-visual data and further tuning, C-MCR achieves
state-of-the-art performance on six datasets across three audio-visual

allow robots to continually learn from limited training data, and avoid
forgetting previous knowledge. While these CL models can mitigate forgetting on
static, systematically collected datasets, it is unclear how human users might
perceive a robot that continually learns over multiple interactions with them.
In this paper, we developed a system that integrates CL models for object
recognition with a Fetch mobile manipulator robot and allows human participants
to directly teach and test the robot over multiple sessions. We conducted an
in-person study with 60 participants who interacted with our system in 300
sessions (5 sessions per participant). We conducted a between-participant study
with three different CL models (3 experimental conditions) to understand human
perceptions of continual learning robots over multiple sessions. Our results
suggest that participants' perceptions of trust, competence, and usability of a
continual learning robot significantly decrease over multiple sessions if the
robot forgets previously learned objects. However, the perceived task load on
participants for teaching and testing the robot remains the same over multiple
sessions even if the robot forgets previously learned objects. Our results also
indicate that state-of-the-art CL models might perform unreliably when applied
to robots interacting with human participants. Further, continual learning
robots are not perceived as very trustworthy or competent by human
participants, regardless of the underlying continual learning model or the
session number.

learning, recent recommendation models start leveraging information from

behavioral graph is not only multiplex but also dynamic, i.e., the graph
evolves rapidly over time, with various types of nodes and edges added or
deleted, which causes the Neighborhood Disturbance. Nevertheless, most existing
methods neglect such streaming dynamics and thus need to be retrained once the
graph has significantly evolved, making them unsuitable in the online learning
environment. Furthermore, the Neighborhood Disturbance existing in dynamic
graphs deteriorates the performance of neighbor-aggregation based graph models.
To this end, we propose SUPA, a novel graph neural network for dynamic

SUPA develops a sample-update-propagate architecture to alleviate neighborhood

subgraph, updates the representations of the two interactive nodes, and
propagates the interaction information to the sampled subgraph. Furthermore, to

high frame-rate of up to 180fps and an ultra-low energy consumption of only
196{\mu}J per inference with an inference efficiency of more than 106
MAC/Cycle. TinyissimoYOLO can be trained for any multi-object detection.
However, considering the small network size, adding object detection classes
will increase the size and memory consumption of the network, thus object
detection with up to 3 classes is demonstrated. Furthermore, the network is
trained using quantization-aware training and deployed with 8-bit quantization
on different microcontrollers, such as STM32H7A3, STM32L4R9, Apollo4b and on
the MAX78000's CNN accelerator. Performance evaluations are presented in this
paper.

niche of Homo Sapiens and our croplands. I use this to extrapolate the degree
of unprecedentedness of future climates. Worton's peeled hull is a
non-parametric, N-dimensional generalization of order statistics. Dominicy and
colleagues show that Hill's estimator of the tail-index can be applied to any
homogeneous function of multivariate order statistics. I apply the
Dominicy-Hill estimator to transects through Worton's peels. I find a thick
tail for low temperatures and a thin tail for high ones. That is, warming is
more worrying than cooling. Similarly, wettening is more worrying than drying.
Furthermore, temperature changes are more important than changes in
precipitation. The results are not affected by income, population density, or
time. I replace the Hill estimator by the QQ one and correct it for
top-censoring. The qualitative results are unaffected.

  production","accepted at Interspeech 2023",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.SD eess.AS eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Previous initial research has already been carried out to propose
speech-based BCI using brain signals (e.g.~non-invasive EEG and invasive sEEG /
ECoG), but there is a lack of combined methods that investigate non-invasive
brain, articulation, and speech signals together and analyze the cognitive
processes in the brain, the kinematics of the articulatory movement and the
resulting speech signal. In this paper, we describe our multimodal
(electroencephalography, ultrasound tongue imaging, and speech) analysis and
synthesis experiments, as a feasibility study. We extend the analysis of brain
signals recorded during speech production with ultrasound-based articulation
data. From the brain signal measured with EEG, we predict ultrasound images of
the tongue with a fully connected deep neural network. The results show that
there is a weak but noticeable relationship between EEG and ultrasound tongue
images, i.e. the network can differentiate articulated speech and neutral
tongue position.

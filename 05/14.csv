quantum system with multiple jump channels. The process is described not only
by the random times between jumps, but also by a sequence of emitted symbols

sequence of symbols. First, we determine a special set of superoperators that
completely govern the dynamics, and provide an efficient way for computing
multi-point distributions and for simulating stochastic trajectories. We also
determine the conditions for the stochastic process to be stationary and show
that the memory between distant emissions is determined by the spectral

support a pattern, where the evolution after each jump runs over a closed set
of states. This, as we argue, can be used to greatly facilitate our prediction

boundary-driven one-dimensional XY spin chain. We show that the statistics
depends dramatically on the chain size. And that the presence of pairing terms

crucial for predictive maintenance in various industries. Numerous
methodologies have been developed over the years to detect bearing faults.
Despite the appearance of numerous different approaches for diagnosing faults
in motors have been proposed, vibration-based methods have become the de facto
standard and the most commonly used techniques. However, acquiring reliable
vibration signals, especially from rotating machinery, can sometimes be
infeasibly difficult due to challenging installation and operational conditions
(e.g., variations on accelerometer locations on the motor body), which will not
only alter the signal patterns significantly but may also induce severe
artifacts. Moreover, sensors are costly and require periodic maintenance to
sustain a reliable signal acquisition. To address these drawbacks and void the
need for vibration sensors, in this study, we propose a novel
sound-to-vibration transformation method that can synthesize realistic
vibration signals directly from the sound measurements regardless of the
working conditions, fault type, and fault severity. As a result, using this
transformation, the data acquired by a simple sound recorder, e.g., a mobile
phone, can be transformed into the vibration signal, which can then be used for
fault detection by a pre-trained model. The proposed method is extensively
evaluated over the benchmark Qatar University Dual-Machine Bearing Fault

Specifically, graph embedding in hyperbolic space has experimentally succeeded
in embedding graphs with hierarchical-tree structure, e.g., data in natural

analyses have shown a much higher upper bound on non-Euclidean graph
embedding's generalization error than Euclidean one's, where a high
generalization error indicates that the incompleteness and noise in the data
can significantly damage learning performance. It implies that the existing
bound cannot guarantee the success of graph embedding in non-Euclidean metric
space in a practical training data size, which can prevent non-Euclidean graph
embedding's application in real problems. This paper provides a novel upper
bound of graph embedding's generalization error by evaluating the local
Rademacher complexity of the model as a function set of the distances of
representation couples. Our bound clarifies that the performance of graph
embedding in non-Euclidean metric space, including hyperbolic space, is better
than the existing upper bounds suggest. Specifically, our new upper bound is
polynomial in the metric space's geometric radius $R$ and can be
$O(\frac{1}{S})$ at the fastest, where $S$ is the training data size. Our bound
is significantly tighter and faster than the existing one, which can be
exponential to $R$ and $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{S}})$ at the fastest. Specific

vertices. A common approach to investigate properties of a network is to use
the adjacency matrix $A=[a_{ij}]_{i,j=1}^n\in\R^{n\times n}$ associated with
the graph $\mathcal{G}$, where $a_{ij}>0$ if there is an edge pointing from
vertex $v_i$ to vertex $v_j$, and $a_{ij}=0$ otherwise. Both $A$ and its
positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph. This paper
proposes to study properties of a graph $\mathcal{G}$ by also using the path
length matrix for the graph. The $(ij)^{th}$ entry of the path length matrix is
the length of the shortest path from vertex $v_i$ to vertex $v_j$; if there is
no path between these vertices, then the value of the entry is $\infty$. Powers
of the path length matrix are formed by using min-plus matrix multiplication
and are important for exhibiting properties of $\mathcal{G}$. We show how
several known measures of communication such as closeness centrality, harmonic
centrality, and eccentricity are related to the path length matrix, and we
introduce new measures of communication, such as the harmonic $K$-centrality
and global $K$-efficiency, where only (short) paths made up of at most $K$
edges are taken into account. The sensitivity of the global $K$-efficiency to
changes of the entries of the adjacency matrix also is considered.

the presence of particles introduces extra stresses to the system and accounts
for the global drag increases. The particle-laden flow cases exhibit spectra
that are consistent with the scaling of $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$ in the large

  An emerging line of work has shown how to use incorporate machine learned

machine learned predictions. The paper considers a repeated newsvendor setting
with nonstationary demand. There is a prediction is for each period's demand
and, as is the case in machine learning, the prediction can be noisy. The goal
is for an inventory management algorithm to take advantage of the prediction
when it is high quality and to have performance bounded by the best possible
algorithm without a prediction when the prediction is highly inaccurate.

solving a non-convex optimization problem. It is often challenging to solve
such a problem numerically due to its non-convexity and having a large number
of layers. To address this challenge, inspired by the human education system,
the multi-grade deep learning (MGDL) model was recently initiated by the author
of this paper. The MGDL model learns a DNN in several grades, in each of which
one constructs a shallow DNN consisting of a small number of layers. The MGDL
model still requires solving several non-convex optimization problems. The
proposed SAL model mutates from the MGDL model. Noting that each layer of a DNN
consists of an affine map followed by an activation function, we propose to
learn the affine map by solving a quadratic/convex optimization problem which
involves the activation function only {\it after} the weight matrix and the
bias vector for the current layer have been trained. In the context of function
approximation, for a given function the SAL model generates an orthogonal
expansion of the function with adaptive basis functions in the form of DNNs. We
establish the Pythagorean identity and the Parseval identity for the orthogonal
system generated by the SAL model. Moreover, we provide a convergence theorem
of the SAL process in the sense that either it terminates after a finite number
of grades or the norms of its optimal error functions strictly decrease to a
limit as the grade number increases to infinity. Furthermore, we present
numerical examples of proof of concept which demonstrate that the proposed SAL
model significantly outperforms the traditional deep learning model.

performance with state-of-the-art transform-based codecs. This motivated the
development of new learning-based visual compression standards such as JPEG-AI.
Of particular interest to these emerging standards is the development of
learning-based image compression systems targeting both humans and machines.
This paper is concerned with learning-based compression schemes whose
compressed-domain representations can be utilized to perform visual processing
and computer vision tasks directly in the compressed domain. In our work, we
adopt a learning-based compressed-domain classification framework for
performing visual recognition using the compressed-domain latent representation
at varying bit-rates. We propose a novel feature adaptation module integrating
a lightweight attention model to adaptively emphasize and enhance the key
features within the extracted channel-wise information. Also, we design an
adaptation training strategy to utilize the pretrained pixel-domain weights.
For comparison, in addition to the performance results that are obtained using
our proposed latent-based compressed-domain method, we also present performance
results using compressed but fully decoded images in the pixel domain as well
as original uncompressed images. The obtained performance results show that our
proposed compressed-domain classification model can distinctly outperform the
existing compressed-domain classification models, and that it can also yield
similar accuracy results with a much higher computational efficiency as
compared to the pixel-domain models that are trained using fully decoded
images.

proposes a heuristic algorithm with low computational complexity that applies
proportional fair (PF) scheduling in the D2D-cellular system. The proposed
algorithm consists of two main phases: i) subchannel allocation and ii)
adjustment of data rates, which are executed for both CUEs and DUEs. In the
subchannel allocation phase for CUEs (or D2D pairs), the users' data rates are
maximized via optimal power allocation to frequency-contiguous subchannels. In
the second phase, a PF scheduling problem is solved to decide the modulation

algorithm benefit from the Water-Filling (WF) technique. The simulation results
suggest that the proposed scheme performs similarly to optimal PF scheduling
from the perspective of users' data rate and their logarithmic sum. An
additional benefit of the proposed scheme is its low computational overhead.

obtain the optimal speed of a $d$-dimensional system evolved unitarily under a

show that for an arbitrary $d$, the optimal state is given by a $X$-state with
an additional property of being symmetric with respect to the secondary
diagonal. For sufficiently low purities for which the purity exceeds the purity
of maximally mixed state $\Id/d$ by at most $2/d^2$, the only nonzero
off-diagonal entry of the optimal state is $\varrho_{1d}$, corresponding to the
transition amplitude between two energy eigenstates with minimum and maximum
eigenvalues, respectively. For larger purities, however, whether or not the
other secondary diameter entries $\varrho_{i,d-i+1}$ take nonzero values
depends on their relative energy gaps $|E_{d-i+1}-E_{i}|$. The effects of
coherence and entanglement, with respect to the energy basis, are also examined
and find that for optimal states both resources are monotonic functions of
purity, so they can causs speed up quantum evolution leading to a smaller

Shwartz-Ziv and Tishby (2017), the training process consists of two distinct

the good generalization performance exhibited by DNNs. Due to the challenging

high-end resource-bounded and computationally very expensive for deployment in

transportation, defense, surveillance, and rescue. These aircraft can fly in
calm conditions but avoid operations in gusty environments, which are seen in
urban canyons, over mountainous terrains, and in ship wakes. Smaller aircraft
are especially prone to such gust disturbances. With extreme weather becoming
ever more frequent due to global warming, it is anticipated that aircraft,
especially those that are smaller in size, encounter large-scale atmospheric
disturbances and still be expected to manage stable flight. However, there
exists virtually no foundation to describe the influence of extreme vortical
gusts on flying bodies. To compound on this difficult problem, there is an
enormous parameter space for gusty conditions wings encounter. While the
interaction between the vortical gusts and wings is seemingly complex and
different for each combination of gust parameters, we show in this study that
the fundamental physics behind extreme aerodynamics is far simpler and low-rank
than traditionally expected. It is revealed that the nonlinear vortical flow
field over time and parameter space can be compressed to only three variables
with a lift-augmented autoencoder while holding the essence of the original
high-dimensional physics. Extreme aerodynamic flows can be optimally compressed
through machine learning into a low-dimensional manifold, implying that the
identification of appropriate coordinates facilitates analyses, modeling, and
control of extremely unsteady gusty flows. The present findings support the
stable flight of next-generation small air vehicles in atmosphere conditions
traditionally considered unflyable.

music piece into another one that evokes specific emotional resonance with the
user in real-time, holds significant application value in various scenarios,
e.g., music therapy, video game soundtracks, and movie scores. However,
balancing emotion real-time fit with soft emotion transition is a challenge due
to the fine-grained and mutable nature of the target emotion. Existing studies
mainly focus on achieving emotion real-time fit, while the issue of soft
transition remains understudied, affecting the overall emotional coherence of
the music. In this paper, we propose SongDriver2 to address this balance.
Specifically, we first recognize the last timestep's music emotion and then
fuse it with the current timestep's target input emotion. The fused emotion
then serves as the guidance for SongDriver2 to generate the upcoming music
based on the input melody data. To adjust music similarity and emotion
real-time fit flexibly, we downsample the original melody and feed it into the
generation model. Furthermore, we design four music theory features to leverage
domain knowledge to enhance emotion information and employ semi-supervised
learning to mitigate the subjective bias introduced by manual dataset
annotation. According to the evaluation results, SongDriver2 surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective metrics. These
results demonstrate that SongDriver2 achieves real-time fit and soft
transitions simultaneously, enhancing the coherence of the generated music.

show that naturalness problem might be evaded at the electroweak scale. Then,
we evaluate the branching ratio of $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ radiative decay at
the Next to leading order. Besides unitarity, boundedness from below
constraints and the present collider data from Higgs signal rate measurements,
the parameter space of $2HDMcT$ is then revisited to see how the modified
Veltman conditions and $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ experimental bounds induce
significant delimitations. Our analysis shows that the naturalness affects
drastically the masses of heavy Higgs $h_3$, $A_2$, $H_2^\pm$ and $H^{\pm\pm}$.
More specifically, we considered three benchmak scenarios corresponding to
$\mu_2 > 20, 40, 70$ GeV. For $\mu_2 > 40$, we find stringent upper limits on

demonstrate that the $\bar{B}\to X_s\gamma$ experimental limits can only be
accommodated within $2HDMcT$ if two conditions are fullfilled : $\alpha_1$
parameter positive and the Higgs mass hierarchy
$m_{h_{3}}>m_{H_2^\pm}>m_{H^{\pm\pm}}$.

are proposed: Listen-and-Learn (LAL), Synchronize-and-Learn (SyAL), and
Source-and-Learn (SoAL). The LAL strategy is a black-box fuzzing strategy used
to discover vulnerabilities without prior protocol knowledge, while the SyAL
strategy, also a black-box fuzzing method, targets vulnerabilities more
accurately with attacker-accessible user information and a novel
probability-based fuzzing approach. The white-box fuzzing strategy, SoAL, is
then employed to identify and explain vulnerabilities through fuzzing of
significant bits. Using the srsRAN 5G platform, the LAL strategy identifies 129
RRC connection vulnerabilities with an average detection duration of 0.072s.
Leveraging the probability-based fuzzing algorithm, the SyAL strategy
outperforms existing models in precision and recall, using significantly fewer

from 5G protocol vulnerabilities. The proposed solution is scalable to other
open-source and commercial 5G platforms and protocols beyond RRC. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution is an efficient and

  Space Data","10 pages with 1 page appendix, camera-ready version for RSS 2023
  (accepted)",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the set of plausible poses
of a rigid object from a set of points with volumetric information, such as
whether each point is in free space or on the surface of the object. In
particular, we study how pose can be estimated from force and tactile data
arising from contact. Using data derived from contact is challenging because it
is inherently less information-dense than visual data, and thus the pose
estimation problem is severely under-constrained when there are few contacts.
Rather than attempting to estimate the true pose of the object, which is not
tractable without a large number of contacts, we seek to estimate a plausible
set of poses which obey the constraints imposed by the sensor data. Existing
methods struggle to estimate this set because they are either designed for
single pose estimates or require informative priors to be effective. Our
approach to this problem, Constrained pose Hypothesis Set Elimination (CHSEL),
has three key attributes: 1) It considers volumetric information, which allows
us to account for known free space; 2) It uses a novel differentiable
volumetric cost function to take advantage of powerful gradient-based
optimization tools; and 3) It uses methods from the Quality Diversity (QD)
optimization literature to produce a diverse set of high-quality poses. To our
knowledge, QD methods have not been used previously for pose registration. We
also show how to update our plausible pose estimates online as more data is
gathered by the robot. Our experiments suggest that CHSEL shows large
performance improvements over several baseline methods for both simulated and
real-world data.

scenario of a subject performing some office work and examined whether the
subjects experienced various levels of memory workload in two different office
setups: 1) a single-monitor setup and 2) a dual-monitor setup. We used EEG band
power, mutual information, and coherence as features to train machine learning

cosmological models. The traditional combined method to constrain the
cosmological parameters designates the corresponding theoretical value and
observational data as functions of redshift, however, sometimes the redshift
cannot be measured directly, or the measurement error is large, or the
definition of redshift is controversial. In this paper, we propose a novel
joint method to constrain parameters that eliminates the redshift $z$ and makes
full use of the multiple observables $\left\lbrace
\mathcal{F}_{1,\mathrm{obs}},\mathcal{F}_{2,\mathrm{obs}},\cdots,\mathcal{F}_{M,\mathrm{obs}}\right\rbrace$
spanning in $M$-dimensional joint observables space. Considering the generality
of the mathematical form of the cosmological models and the guidance from low
to high dimensions, we firstly validate our method in a three-dimensional joint
observables space spanned by $H(z)$, $f\sigma_{8}(z)$ and $D_{A}(z)$, where the
three coordinates can be considered redshift-free measurements of the same
celestial body (or shared-redshift data reconstructed model independently). Our
results are consistent with the traditional combined method but with lower
errors, yielding $H_0=68.7\pm0.1\mathrm{~km}

$\sigma_{8}=0.82\pm0.01$ and showing alleviated parametric degeneracies to some
extent. In principle, our joint constraint method allows an extended form
keeping the redshift information as an independent coordinate and can also be
readily degraded to the form of a traditional combined method to constrain
parameters.

Specifically, we maintain a distribution on promising finite-horizon policy
trees. The distribution is iteratively updated by sampling policies, evaluating
them via Monte Carlo simulation, and refitting them to the top-performing ones.
Our method is lazy in the sense that it exploits the policy tree representation
to avoid redundant computations in policy sampling, evaluation, and
distribution update. This leads to computational savings of up to two orders of
magnitude. Our LCEOPT is surprisingly simple as compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, yet empirically outperforms them on several

a class of generic composite optimization problems over multi-agent
cyberphysical systems (CPSs), with the existence of an unknown number of

(VR) techniques and a norm-penalized approximation strategy, we propose a
decentralized Byzantine-resilient proximal-gradient algorithmic framework,
dubbed Prox-DBRO-VR, which achieves an optimization and control goal using only
local computation and communication. To reduce asymptotically the variance
generated by evaluating the noisy stochastic gradients, we incorporate two
localized variance-reduced techniques (SAGA and LSVRG) into Prox-DBRO-VR, to
design Prox-DBRO-SAGA and Prox-DBRO-LSVRG. Via analyzing the contraction
relationships among the gradient-learning error, robust consensus condition and
optimal gap, the theoretical result demonstrates that both Prox-DBRO-SAGA and
Prox-DBRO-LSVRG, with a well-designed constant (resp., decaying) step-size,
converge linearly (resp., sub-linearly) inside an error ball around the optimal
solution of the optimization problem under standard assumptions. The trade-offs
between the convergence accuracy and the number of Byzantine agents in both
linear and sub-linear cases are characterized. In simulation, we show the
effectiveness and practicability of the proposed algorithms via handling
decentralized learning problems based on logistic regression and neural

  In this paper, we strengthen simulation-based testing by introducing the

multiple general-purpose simulators, built with different technologies. First,
test cases are automatically generated for each individual simulator. Then,
tests are migrated between simulators, using feature maps to characterize of
the exercised driving conditions. Finally, the joint predicted failure
probability is computed and a failure is reported only in cases of agreement
among the siblings.

vehicle on a large set of test cases. Our study shows that the ensemble failure
predictor by the digital siblings is superior to each individual simulator at
predicting the failures of the digital twin. We discuss several ways in which

addresses the residual causal effect through model-based reward estimation. We
show that the proposed estimator is unbiased under a new condition, called
local correctness, which only requires that the residual-effect model preserves
the relative expected reward differences of the actions within each cluster. To
best leverage the CEM and local correctness, we also propose a new two-step

$\rho(y):=\ln\mathbb{E}[e^{\left<y,Z\right>}]$ as a soft-max of
$\left<y,Z\right>$. We explore lower bounds on $\mathbb{E}[\rho(Y)]$ in terms
of the minimum mutual information $I(Z,\bar{Z})$ over $P_{Z\bar{Z}}$ which is a
coupling of $P_Z$ and itself such that $Z-\bar{Z}$ is bounded in a certain
sense. This may be viewed as a soft version of Sudakov's minoration, which
lower bounds the expected supremum of a stochastic process in terms of the
packing number. Our method is based on convex geometry (thrifty approximation
of convex bodies), and works for general non-Gaussian $Y$. When $Y$ is Gaussian
and $\bar{Z}$ converges to $Z$, this recovers a recent inequality of
Bai-Wu-Ozgur on information-constrained optimal transport, previously
established using Gaussian-specific techniques. We also use soft-minoration to
obtain asymptotically (in tensor order) tight bounds on the free energy in the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with spins uniformly distributed on a type class,
implying asymptotically tight bounds for the type~II error exponent in spiked
tensor detection.

semigroups rather than generalized categories, and we obtain category
isomorphisms between the clesses of semigroups and categories rather than

two kinds of quality issues: technical quality (distortions), and semantic

help them minimize occurrences of common technical distortions, such as blur,
poor exposure, and noise. We do not address the complementary problems of
semantic quality, leaving that aspect for future work. The problem of assessing
and providing actionable feedback on the technical quality of pictures captured
by visually impaired users is hard enough, owing to the severe, commingled
distortions that often occur. To advance progress on the problem of analyzing
and measuring the technical quality of visually impaired user-generated content
(VI-UGC), we built a very large and unique subjective image quality and
distortion dataset. This new perceptual resource, which we call the LIVE-Meta
VI-UGC Database, contains $40$K real-world distorted VI-UGC images and $40$K
patches, on which we recorded $2.7$M human perceptual quality judgments and
$2.7$M distortion labels. Using this psychometric resource we also created an
automatic blind picture quality and distortion predictor that learns
local-to-global spatial quality relationships, achieving state-of-the-art
prediction performance on VI-UGC pictures, significantly outperforming existing
picture quality models on this unique class of distorted picture data. We also
created a prototype feedback system that helps to guide users to mitigate
quality issues and take better quality pictures, by creating a multi-task

RFS completely neglects the instance counts and solely relies on the image

The goal of this study is to present a non-intrusive, accurate, and

performance of CSI feedback. In contrast to its counterpart in Release 16, the
Type-II codebook in Release 17 (R17) exploits the angular-delay-domain partial
reciprocity between uplink and downlink channels and selects part of
angular-delay-domain ports for measuring and feeding back the downlink CSI,
where the performance of the conventional deep learning methods is limited due
to the deficiency of sparse structures. To address this issue, we propose the
new paradigm of adopting deep learning to improve the performance of R17

of uplink channels, deep learning is utilized to refine the selection of the
dominant angular-delay-domain ports, where the focal loss is harnessed to solve
the class imbalance problem. Secondly, we propose to reconstruct the downlink
CSI by way of deep learning based on the feedback of R17 Type-II codebook at
the base station, where the information of sparse structures can be effectively
leveraged. Finally, a weighted shortcut module is designed to facilitate the
accurate reconstruction, and a two-stage loss function with the combination of
the mean squared error and sum rate is proposed for adapting to actual
multi-user scenarios. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed
angular-delay-domain port selection and CSI reconstruction paradigm can improve

the Simpson-Visser metric. We find the radial and angular force profiles for a
radially in-falling particle in this spacetime and calculate the variation of
the geodesic separation vector with the radial coordinate using two different
initial conditions. These results are then compared with that of Schwarzschild
black hole spacetime. We show that for a regular black hole, both radial and

ultimately switch their behavior from stretching to compression and vice-versa.
Also, they are finite at $r=0$ unlike the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is also

Our previous studies of EL time properties revealed the presence of two unusual
slow components in S2 signal of two-phase argon detector, with time constants
of about 4-5 $\mu$s and 50 $\mu$s. The puzzle of slow components is that their
time constants and contributions to the overall signal increase with electric
field (starting from a certain threshold), which cannot be explained by any of
the known mechanisms of photon and electron emission in two-phase media. There
are indications that these slow components result from delayed electrons,
temporarily trapped during their drift in the EL gap on metastable negative
argon ions of yet unknown nature. In this work, this hypothesis is convincingly
confirmed by studying the time properties of electroluminescence in a Thick Gas
Electron Multiplier (THGEM) coupled to the EL gap of two-phase argon detector.
In particular, an unusual slow component in EL signal, similar to that observed
in the EL gap, was observed in THGEM itself. In addition, with the help of
THGEM operated in electron multiplication mode, the slow component was observed
directly in the charge signal, unambiguously confirming the effect of trapped
electrons in S2 signal. These results will help to unravel the puzzle of slow
components in two-phase argon detectors and thus to understand the background
in low-mass WIMP searches.

  by learning optimal search space size",,,,,"math.OC cs.CC cs.NE cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) solves a multivariate optimization
problem to estimate the system's optimal control inputs in each control cycle.
Such optimization is made more difficult by several factors, such as
nonlinearities inherited in the system, highly coupled inputs, and various
constraints related to the system's physical limitations. These factors make
the optimization to be non-convex and hard to solve traditionally. Genetic
algorithm (GA) is typically used extensively to tackle such optimization in
several application domains because it does not involve differential
calculation or gradient evaluation in its solution estimation. However, the
size of the search space in which the GA searches for the optimal control
inputs is crucial for the applicability of the GA with systems that require
fast response. This paper proposes an approach to accelerate the genetic
optimization of NMPC by learning optimal search space size. The proposed
approach trains a multivariate regression model to adaptively predict the best
smallest search space in every control cycle. The estimated best smallest size
of search space is fed to the GA to allow for searching the optimal control
inputs within this search space. The proposed approach not only reduces the
GA's computational time but also improves the chance of obtaining the optimal
control inputs in each cycle. The proposed approach was evaluated on two
nonlinear systems and compared with two other genetic-based NMPC approaches
implemented on the GPU of a Nvidia Jetson TX2 embedded platform in a
processor-in-the-loop (PIL) fashion. The results show that the proposed
approach provides a 39-53\% reduction in computational time. Additionally, it
increases the convergence percentage to the optimal control inputs within the
cycle's time by 48-56\%, resulting in a significant performance enhancement.

dominant dark matter relic is from sterile neutrinos, with only a small
fraction originating from the ultralight scalar. Furthermore, the model
predicts a detectable X/Gamma-ray flux proportional to the cubic density of
local sterile neutrinos for a light scalar mass due to the light scalar

unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge
comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a
potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out
two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly,
the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn
the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1
information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden
information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap
with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To
address these issues, we propose a novel method named \textbf{T}op-1

iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the

Difference is an extension or generalization of differential in the discrete

failure in meeting the most fundamental definition of differential, where dy

the network are required to select a gas price for submission with their
transaction, creating a risk of overpaying or delayed/unprocessed transactions

London Hard Fork and shed insight into the transaction dynamics of the net-work
after this major fork. As such, this paper provides an update on work previous
to 2019 on the link between EthUSD BitUSD and gas price. For forecasting, we
compare a novel combination of machine learning methods such as Direct
Recursive Hybrid LSTM, CNNLSTM, and Attention LSTM. These are combined with
wavelet threshold denoising and matrix profile data processing toward the
forecasting of block minimum gas price, on a 5-min timescale, over multiple
lookaheads. As the first application of the matrix profile being applied to gas
price data and forecasting we are aware of, this study demonstrates that matrix
profile data can enhance attention-based models however, given the hardware
constraints, hybrid models outperformed attention and CNNLSTM models. The
wavelet coherence of inputs demonstrates correlation in multiple variables on a
1 day timescale, which is a deviation of base free from gas price. A
Direct-Recursive Hybrid LSTM strategy outperforms other models. Hybrid models
have favourable performance up to a 20 min lookahead with performance being
comparable to attention models when forecasting 25/50-min ahead. Forecasts over
a range of lookaheads allow users to make an informed decision on gas price
selection and the optimal window to submit their transaction in without fear of
their transaction being rejected. This, in turn, gives more detailed insight
into gas price dynamics than existing recommenders, oracles and forecasting
approaches, which provide simple heuristics or limited lookahead horizons.

Hong Kong secondary geography education. Analyzing GIS benefits by literature
review, it is believed that GIS should be included in both the senior and
junior geography curriculum. Moreover, the literature review indicates that
without clear instruction from the Hong Kong Education Bureau (EDB), low

academia and textbook publishers, GIS cannot be implemented in secondary
schools of Hong Kong. Therefore, suggestions are made for the EDB, geography
teachers, academia and textbook publishers to facilitate GIS involvement in
senior and junior geography curriculums. The EDB can develop clear guidelines
for teachers, academia and textbook publishers' references, and offer
student-centered GIS educational courses for teachers. It is important for
teachers to be prepared for advanced GIS technology and to even learn along
with students. Academics and textbook publishers can provide free GIS maps
targeted at Hong Kong' junior and senior geography curriculums. Although the

ground states of a set of gapped Hamiltonians which are evolved adiabatically
through a discretized parameter space. Because matrix product states transform
under a projective representation, evaluating the Berry curvature on a closed

Berry curvature is evaluated on small tetrahedra in parameter space. Our

$\eta$-Au$_2$S, a buckled penta-monolayer composed of a square Au lattice and S
adatoms. The $\theta$-Au$_2$S is regarded as a distorted structure of

$\theta$-Au$_2$S intersect at the $\Gamma$ point, leading to linear dispersion,
whereas $\eta$-Au$_2$S has a band gap of 1.02 eV. The conduction band minimum

operates similarly to humans, by taking into account the utility of the

A society of intelligent agents, interacting through the repeated multistep

beyond 5G (B5G) networks is challenging due to the dynamic nature of the
underlying network conditions. Several Adaptive Bit Rate (ABR) algorithms have
been developed to improve QoE, but most of them are designed based on fixed
rules and unsuitable for a wide range of network conditions. Recently, Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C)
methods have recently demonstrated promise in their ability to generalise to
diverse network conditions, but they still have limitations. One specific issue
with A3C methods is the lag between each actor's behavior policy and central
learner's target policy. Consequently, suboptimal updates emerge when the
behavior and target policies become out of synchronization. In this paper, we
address the problems faced by vanilla-A3C by integrating the on-policy-based
multi-agent DRL method into the existing video streaming framework.
Specifically, we propose a novel system for ABR generation - Proximal Policy
Optimization-based DRL for Adaptive Bit Rate streaming (PPO-ABR). Our proposed
method improves the overall video QoE by maximizing sample efficiency using a
clipped probability ratio between the new and the old policies on multiple
epochs of minibatch updates. The experiments on real network traces demonstrate
that PPO-ABR outperforms state-of-the-art methods for different QoE variants.

many challenges exist in making these solutions business-grade. For instance,
maintaining the error rate of the underlying ML models at an acceptably low

particular, we prefer strategies that use feature-based slicing because they
are human-interpretable, model-agnostic, and require minimal supplementary
inputs or knowledge. In addition, we show that these strategies outperform
several common baselines, such as selecting observations with prediction
confidence below a threshold. To evaluate strategies, we introduce metrics to
measure various desired qualities, such as their performance, stability, and
generalizability to unseen data; the strategies are evaluated on several
publicly-available datasets. We use TOPSIS, a Multiple Criteria Decision Making

due to its high adaptability to various bit-width requirements during runtime.
However, in this paper, we investigate existing methods and observe a
significant accumulation of quantization errors caused by frequent bit-width
switching of weights and activations, leading to limited performance. To
address this issue, we propose MultiQuant, a novel method that utilizes a
multi-branch topology for arbitrary bit-width quantization. MultiQuant
duplicates the network body into multiple independent branches and quantizes
the weights of each branch to a fixed 2-bit while retaining the input
activations in the expected bit-width. This approach maintains the
computational cost as the same while avoiding the switching of weight
bit-widths, thereby substantially reducing errors in weight quantization.
Additionally, we introduce an amortization branch selection strategy to
distribute quantization errors caused by activation bit-width switching among
branches to enhance performance. Finally, we design an in-place distillation
strategy that facilitates guidance between branches to further enhance
MultiQuant's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MultiQuant
achieves significant performance gains compared to existing arbitrary bit-width
quantization methods. Code is at \url{https://github.com/zysxmu/MultiQuant}.

establish a mechanism for the generation of magnon squeezing in the easy-axis

tuning an external magnetic field near the Ising phase transition point. When
the magnet is coupled to the cavity field, the effective cavity-magnon
interaction becomes proportional to the magnon squeezing, allowing one to
enhance the cavity-magnon coupling strength using a static field. We
demonstrate that the magnon squeezing can be probed by measuring the frequency

can be observed in our setup by tuning the static magnetic field, overcoming
the challenge that the magnetic interaction between the cavity and the magnet

unpredictability and fast-varying characteristic of natural surfaces, it is
often very difficult to capture and reconstruct them accurately. Moreover, the
non-smooth nature results in the occlusion of major areas when a small number
of captures are used for reconstruction, resulting in loss of important and
maybe significant information or surface features. In a perfect orthographic
reconstruction, images must be captured normal to each point on the surface
which is practically implausible. This thesis aims at proposing several
algorithms for deciding optimal capture points, given a surface, such that the
optimal captures can be used for an approximate orthographic reconstruction. An
approximate orthographic capture has been attributed to a small field of view
and a closed form relationship has been derived for evaluating local
orthographic capture region which varies depending on the point of capture on
the surface. Based on the formula to calculate approximate local orthographic
regions, several algorithms have been developed using non-convex optimization
techniques for covering the entire surface with minimum number of such capture
points. The algorithms have been compared on the basis of accuracy and
computational complexity and parameters have been tuned depending on the nature
of the surface. A separate algorithm has been proposed to identify such capture
points empirically depending on the local surface-curvatures. Given these
algorithms, users can make informed choices regarding which to adopt in their

examples, i.e., the mapping rules are unknown. The transmitter applies a
learning algorithm to the available examples, and extracts knowledge from the
data by optimizing a probability distribution over a set of models, i.e., known
functions, which can better describe the observed data, and so potentially the
underlying concepts. The transmitter then needs to communicate the learned
models to a remote receiver through a rate-limited channel, to allow the
receiver to decode the models that can describe the underlying sampled concepts
as accurately as possible in their semantic space. After motivating our
analysis, we propose the formal problem of communicating concepts, and provide
its rate-distortion characterization, pointing out its connection with the
concepts of empirical and strong coordination in a network. We also provide a
bound for the distortion-rate function.

investigates the folding stable state of the Bi-DCB through the analytical

evaders with a given limit on their speed cannot escape the sweeping agents. A
simpler task for the sweeping formation is the confinement of evaders to a

these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic constraints that impose a lower
bound on the speed that the sweeping agents must have. This critical speed is
derived to ensure the satisfaction of the confinement task. Increasing the

responses in transport are estimated to be substantial, because in real
materials such as TaAs or Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$, the Fermi level resides near the
Weyl nodes where the chiral charge pumping is said to diverge. However, this
work presents semiclassical Boltzmann analysis that indicates that the chiral
charge pumping is non-divergent even at the zero-temperature limit. We
demonstrate that the divergence in common semiclassical calculation scheme is
not a problem of the scheme itself, but occurs because a commonly-used
approximation of the change in particle number breaks down near the Weyl nodes.
Our result suggests the possibility that the nonlinear properties in WSMs can
be overestimated, and provides the validity condition for the conventional
approximation. We also show the distinct Fermi level dependencies of the chiral
magnetic effect and the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, as a
consequence of non-diverging chiral charge pumping.

about what it means for opportunities to be equal. The algorithmic fairness
community often relies on formal approaches to quantitatively determine if
opportunities are allocated equally. A more structural approach put forth by
Joseph Fishkin focuses on the wider network of decisions that determine which
opportunities are allocated to whom. In this so-called opportunity structure,
decision points represent bottlenecks that are often chained together so that
the output of one decision is an input to the next. By evaluating the severity
and legitimacy of these bottlenecks, Fishkin offers a qualitative framework to
assess whether equal opportunity is infringed upon in a structural way. We
adopt this structural viewpoint and use it to reframe many interdisciplinary
discussions about equal opportunity in systems of algorithmic decision-making.
Drawing on examples from education, healthcare, and criminal justice, we
recommend prioritizing regulatory and design-based interventions that alleviate
severe bottlenecks in order to help expand access to opportunities in a
pluralistic way.

simulations. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, central galaxies in massive
halos have lower gas-phase metallicity than those in low-mass halos. On the
contrary, satellite galaxies residing in more massive halos are more
metal-rich. The combined effect is that massive galaxies are more metal-poor in
massive halos, and low-mass galaxies are more metal-rich in massive halos. By
inspecting the environmental dependence of other galaxy properties, we identify
that the accretion of low-metallicity gas is responsible for the environmental
dependence of central galaxies at high $z$, whereas the AGN feedback processes
play a crucial role at low $z$. For satellite galaxies, we find that both the
suppression of gas accretion and the stripping of existing gas are responsible
for their environmental dependence, with negligible effect from the AGN
feedback. Finally, we show that the difference of gas-phase metallicity as a
function of stellar mass between protocluster and field galaxies agrees with
recent observational results, for example from the MAMMOTH-Grism survey.

showed that disks with a baroclinic stratification under the influence of

instability is the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF), which is the
local version of the Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) and the other is a
thermal overstability, the Convective Overstability (COS).
  In the present paper we reproduce the analytic predicted growth rates for
both instabilities in numerical experiments of small axisymmetric sections of
vertically isothermal disks with a radial temperature gradient, especially for
cooling times longer than the critical cooling time for VSI. In this cooling
time regime our simulations reveal the simultaneous and independent growth of
both modes: COS and GSF. We consistently observe that GSF modes exhibit a
faster growth rate compared to COS modes. Near the midplane, GSF modes
eventually stop growing, while COS modes continue to grow and ultimately
dominate the flow pattern.
  Away from the midplane, we find GSF modes to saturate, when bands of constant
angular momentum have formed. In these bands we observe the formation and
growth of eddies driven by the baroclinic term, further enhancing the velocity
perturbations. In geophysics this effect is known as horizontal convection or
sea-breeze instability. Three-dimensional simulations will have to show whether
similar effects will occur when axisymmetry is not enforced. Our local
simulations help to reveal the numerical resolution requirements to observe
thermal instabilities in global simulations of disks around young stars.

young stellar object CI Tau to constrain the inner disk properties and better
understand the magnetospheric accretion phenomenon. Methods: The high
sensitivity offered by the combination of the four 8-m telescopes of the VLTI
allied with the spectral resolution of the K-band beam combiner GRAVITY offers
a unique capability to probe the sub-au scale of the CI Tau system, tracing
both dust and gas emission regions. We develop a geometrical model to fit the
interferometric observables and constrain the physical properties of the inner
dusty disk. The continuum-corrected pure line visibilities have been used to
estimate the size of the Br$\gamma$ emitting region. Results: From the K-band
continuum study, we report an highly inclined resolved inner dusty disk, with
an inner edge located at a distance of $21\pm2\,R_\star$ from the central star,
which is significantly larger than the dust sublimation radius (R$_{sub}= 4.3$
to $8.6\,R_\star$). The inner disk appears misaligned compared to the outer
disk observed by ALMA and the non-zero closure phase indicates the presence of
a bright asymmetry on the south-west side. From the differential visibilities
across the Br$\gamma$ line, we resolve the line emitting region, and measure a
size of $4.8^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ $R_\star$. Conclusions: The extended inner disk
edge compared to the dust sublimation radius is consistent with the claim of an
inner planet, CI Tau b, orbiting close-in. The inner-outer disk misalignment
may be induced by gravitational torques or magnetic warping. The size of the
Br$\gamma$ emitting region is consistent with the magnetospheric accretion
process. Assuming it corresponds to the magnetospheric radius, it is
significantly smaller than the co-rotation radius, which suggests an unstable
accretion regime that is consistent with CI Tau being a burster.

a novel approach effectively coupling with high-dimensional test, which is
distinct from existing methods based on scan or knockoff statistics. The idea
is to conduct binary segmentation with re-search and arrangement based on a
sequence of dynamic tests to increase detection accuracy and reduce
computation. Theoretical and empirical studies demonstrate that our approach
enjoys favorable theoretical guarantees with fewer restrictions and exhibits
superior numerical performance with faster computation. Compared to scan-based
methods, our procedure is capable of detecting shorter or longer regions with
unbalanced signal strengths while allowing for more dependence structures.
Relative to the knockoff framework that only controls false discovery rate, our
approach attains higher detection accuracy while controlling the family-wise
error rate. Utilizing the UK Biobank data to identify the genetic regions
related to breast cancer, we confirm previous findings and meanwhile, identify
a number of new regions which suggest strong association with risk of breast

the target interface is accurately captured, (ii) the gradient has a unit norm,
and (iii) two outputs are approximated by a single network. Moreover, unlike a
conventional loss term which uses a residual of the eikonal equation, a novel
training objective consisting of three loss terms is designed. The first loss
function enforces a pointwise matching between two outputs of the augmented

the SDF imposes the shortest path obtained by the gradient. The third loss
function regularizes a singularity of the SDF caused by discontinuities of the
gradient. Numerical results across a wide range of complex and irregular

opportunity to compare cosmological constraints inferred using two
well-established relations - the X-ray/UV luminosity ($L_{X}-L_{UV}$) relation

$L_{X}-L_{UV}$ and $R-L$ luminosity distances to the same quasars exhibit a
distribution of their differences that is generally positively skewed for the
six cosmological models we consider. This behaviour can be interpreted
qualitatively to arise as a result of the dust extinction of UV/X-ray quasar
emission. We show that the extinction always contributes to the non-zero
difference between $L_{X}-L_{UV}$-based and $R-L$-based luminosity distances
and we derive a linear relationship between the X-ray/UV colour index
$E_{X-UV}$ and the median/mean value of the luminosity-distance difference,
which also depends on the value of the $L_{X}-L_{UV}$ relation slope. Taking
into account the prevailing positive values of the luminosity-distance
difference median, we estimate an average X-ray/UV colour index of
$\overline{E}_{X-UV}=0.089 \pm 0.019$ mag, while the value based on the
positive mean values of the difference is $\overline{E}_{X-UV}=0.050\pm 0.013$

of quasars since it originates in the circumnuclear and interstellar media of
host galaxies. It can only be slightly alleviated by the standard hard X-ray

due to their ability to protect user data privacy. In FedRecs, a central server
collaboratively learns recommendation models by sharing model public parameters
with clients, thereby offering a privacy-preserving solution. Unfortunately,
the exposure of model parameters leaves a backdoor for adversaries to
manipulate FedRecs. Existing works about FedRec security already reveal that
items can easily be promoted by malicious users via model poisoning attacks,
but all of them mainly focus on FedRecs with only collaborative information
(i.e., user-item interactions). We argue that these attacks are effective
because of the data sparsity of collaborative signals. In practice, auxiliary
information, such as products' visual descriptions, is used to alleviate
collaborative filtering data's sparsity. Therefore, when incorporating visual
information in FedRecs, all existing model poisoning attacks' effectiveness
becomes questionable. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to verify
that incorporating visual information can beat existing state-of-the-art
attacks in reasonable settings. However, since visual information is usually
provided by external sources, simply including it will create new security
problems. Specifically, we propose a new kind of poisoning attack for
visually-aware FedRecs, namely image poisoning attacks, where adversaries can
gradually modify the uploaded image to manipulate item ranks during FedRecs'
training process. Furthermore, we reveal that the potential collaboration
between image poisoning attacks and model poisoning attacks will make
visually-aware FedRecs more vulnerable to being manipulated. To safely use

purify each uploaded image and detect the adversarial images.

studying the relationship between field theories in different dimensions. An
interesting observation is that when two theories are related by dimensional
reduction on a compact surface, their 't Hooft anomalies corresponding to
continuous symmetries are also related: the anomaly polynomial of the
lower-dimensional theory can be obtained by integrating that of the
higher-dimensional one on the compact surface. Naturally, this relation only
holds if both theories are even dimensional. This raises the question of
whether similar relations can also hold for the case of anomalies in discrete

generalization to discrete symmetries is that the anomaly theories, associated
with the lower and higher dimensional theories, would be related by reduction
on the compact surface. We explore this idea for compactifications of 5d
superconformal field theories (SCFTs) to 3d on Riemann surfaces with
global-symmetry fluxes. In this context, it can be used both as a check for

manipulation relies largely on comparing DNS resolutions with trusted control
results to identify inconsistencies. However, the emergence of CDNs and other
cloud providers practicing content localization and load balancing leads to
these heuristics being inaccurate, paving the need for more verifiable signals
of DNS manipulation. In this paper, we develop a new technique, CERTainty, that
utilizes the widely established TLS certificate ecosystem to accurately detect
DNS manipulation, and obtain more information about the adversaries performing
such manipulation. We find that untrusted certificates, mismatching hostnames,
and blockpages are powerful proxies for detecting DNS manipulation. Our results
show that previous work using consistency-based heuristics is inaccurate,
allowing for 72.45% false positives in the cases detected as DNS manipulation.

presence of 55 ASes in 26 countries that perform ISP-level DNS manipulation. We

representation models the traffic scene as a graph which is constructed by a

relative relationships. All relative features under this representation are
both translationand rotation-invariant. Based on this representation, TSGN
captures the spatial-temporal features across agents, road network,
interactions among them, and temporal dependencies of temporal traffic scenes.
TSGN can predict multimodal future trajectories for all agents simultaneously,
plausibly, and accurately. Meanwhile, we propose a Hierarchical Lane
Transformer for capturing interactions between agents and road network, which
filters the surrounding road network and only keeps the most probable lane
segments which could have an impact on the future behavior of the target agent.
Without sacrificing the prediction performance, this greatly reduces the
computational burden. Experiments show TSGN achieves state-of-the-art

possible sources, and potential ways to constrain them. The seasonal cycle of
global ET-WB possesses a unimodal distribution with the highest (median value:
65.61 mm/month) and lowest (median value: 36.11 mm/month) values in July and
January, respectively, with the spread range of roughly +/-10 mm/month from
different subsets of the ensemble. Auxiliary ET products illustrate similar
intra-annual characteristics with some over/under-estimation, which are
completely within the range of the ET-WB ensemble. We found a gradual increase
in global ET-WB from 2003 to 2010 and a subsequent decrease during 2010-2015,
followed by a sharper reduction in the remaining years primarily attributed to
the varying precipitation. Multiple statistical metrics show reasonably good
accuracy of monthly ET-WB (e.g., a relative bias of +/-20%) in most river
basins, which ameliorates at annual scales. The long-term mean annual ET-WB
varies within 500-600 mm/yr and is consistent with the for auxiliary ET
products (543-569 mm/yr). Observed trend estimates, though regionally
divergent, are evidence of the increasing ET in a warming climate.

nano-resolution hard X-ray computed tomography (CT) system can be significantly
improved by accessing the phase information. To do so, a grating-based Lau
interferometer needs to be integrated. However, the nano-resolution phase
contrast CT, denoted as nPCT, reconstructed from such an interferometer system
may suffer resolution loss due to the strong signal diffraction. Aimed at
performing accurate nPCT image reconstruction directly from these diffracted
projections, a new model-driven nPCT image reconstruction algorithm is
developed. First, the diffraction procedure is mathematically modeled into a
matrix B, from which the projections without signal splitting can be generated
invertedly. Second, a penalized weighed least-square model with total variation
(PWLS-TV) is employed to denoise these projections. Finally, nPCT images with
high resolution and high accuracy are reconstructed using the
filtered-back-projection (FBP) method. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
this algorithm is able to deal with diffracted projections having any splitting
distances. Interestingly, results reveal that nPCT images with higher
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) can be reconstructed from projections with larger
signal splittings. In conclusion, a novel model-driven nPCT image
reconstruction algorithm with high accuracy and robustness is verified for the
Lau interferometer based hard X-ray nPCT imaging system.

  https://github.com/Kiode/Text_Watermark_Language_Models",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LLMs now exhibit human-like skills in various fields, leading to worries
about misuse. Thus, detecting generated text is crucial. However, passive
detection methods are stuck in domain specificity and limited adversarial
robustness. To achieve reliable detection, a watermark-based method was
proposed for white-box LLMs, allowing them to embed watermarks during text
generation. The method involves randomly dividing the model vocabulary to
obtain a special list and adjusting the probability distribution to promote the
selection of words in the list. A detection algorithm aware of the list can
identify the watermarked text. However, this method is not applicable in many
real-world scenarios where only black-box language models are available. For
instance, third-parties that develop API-based vertical applications cannot
watermark text themselves because API providers only supply generated text and
withhold probability distributions to shield their commercial interests. To
allow third-parties to autonomously inject watermarks into generated text, we
develop a watermarking framework for black-box language model usage scenarios.
Specifically, we first define a binary encoding function to compute a random
binary encoding corresponding to a word. The encodings computed for
non-watermarked text conform to a Bernoulli distribution, wherein the
probability of a word representing bit-1 being approximately 0.5. To inject a
watermark, we alter the distribution by selectively replacing words
representing bit-0 with context-based synonyms that represent bit-1. A
statistical test is then used to identify the watermark. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both Chinese and English
datasets. Furthermore, results under re-translation, polishing, word deletion,
and synonym substitution attacks reveal that it is arduous to remove the
watermark without compromising the original semantics.

initial path generated is not optimal and the convergence is too slow to be
used in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel image-based
learning algorithm (CBAGAN-RRT) using a Convolutional Block Attention
Generative Adversarial Network with a combination of spatial and channel
attention and a novel loss function to design the heuristics, find a better
optimal path, and improve the convergence of the algorithm both concerning time
and speed. The probability distribution of the paths generated from our GAN
model is used to guide the sampling process for the RRT algorithm. We train and
test our network on the dataset generated by \cite{zhang2021generative} and
demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
algorithms using both the image quality generation metrics like IOU Score, Dice
Score, FID score, and path planning metrics like time cost and the number of
nodes. We conduct detailed experiments and ablation studies to illustrate the
feasibility of our study and show that our model performs well not only on the
training dataset but also on the unseen test dataset. The advantage of our
approach is that we can avoid the complicated preprocessing in the state space,
our model can be generalized to complicated environments like those containing
turns and narrow passages without loss of accuracy, and our model can be easily
integrated with other sampling-based path planning algorithms.

balance, which directly affects the planet, the climate, and the life on this

drones. The forest monitoring process is performed continuously to track any
changes in the monitored region within the forest. During fires, drones'
capture data is used to increase the follow-up speed and enhance the control
process of these fires to prevent their spread. The time factor in such
problems determines the success rate of the fire extinguishing process, as
appropriate data at the right time may be the decisive factor in controlling
fires, preventing their spread, extinguishing them, and limiting their losses.
Therefore, this research presented the problem of monitoring task scheduling
for drones in the forest monitoring system. This problem is solved by
developing several algorithms with the aim of minimizing the total completion
time required to carry out all the drones' assigned tasks. System performance
is measured by using 990 instances of three different classes. The performed
experimental results indicated the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and
their ability to act efficiently to achieve the desired goal. The algorithm
$RID$ achieved the best performance with a percentage rate of up to 90.3% with

wireless resource allocation problems in real-time. However, multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) structures, which are
inherited from image processing tasks, are not optimized for wireless network
problems. As network size increases, these methods get harder to train and
generalize. User pairing is one such essential NP-hard optimization problem in
wireless communication systems that entails selecting users to be scheduled
together while minimizing interference and maximizing throughput. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised graph neural network (GNN) approach to
efficiently solve the user pairing problem. Our proposed method utilizes the
Erdos goes neural pipeline to significantly outperform other scheduling methods
such as k-means and semi-orthogonal user scheduling (SUS). At 20 dB SNR, our
proposed approach achieves a 49% better sum rate than k-means and a staggering
95% better sum rate than SUS while consuming minimal time and resources. The
scalability of the proposed method is also explored as our model can handle
dynamic changes in network size without experiencing a substantial decrease in
performance. Moreover, our model can accomplish this without being explicitly
trained for larger or smaller networks facilitating a dynamic functionality
that cannot be achieved using CNNs or MLPs.

monitoring and measuring sustainability performance at various levels and in
many fields, including healthcare. However, there is no agreed approach to
assessing the sustainability of health systems. Moreover, social indicators are
less developed and less succinct. Therefore, the authors seek to map
sustainable reference values in healthcare and propose a conceptual and
structured framework that can guide the measurement of the social
sustainability-oriented health systems. Based on a new multi-criteria method
called Strong Sustainability Paradigm based Analytical Hierarchy Process,
(SSP-AHP), the presented approach opens the availability for systems'
comparison and benchmarking. The Strong Sustainability Paradigm incorporated
into the multi-criteria evaluation method prevents the exchangeability of
criteria by promoting alternatives that achieve good performance values on all
criteria, implying sustainability. The research results offer insights into the
core domains, sub-domains, and indicators supporting a more comprehensive
assessment of the social sustainability of health systems. The framework
constructed in this study consists of five major areas: equity, quality,
responsiveness, financial coverage, and adaptability. The proposed set of
indicators can also serve as a reference instrument, providing transparency
about core aspects of performance to be measured and reported, as well as
supporting policy-makers in decisions regarding sectoral strategies in
healthcare. Our findings suggest that the most socially sustainable systems are
Nordic countries. They offer a high level of social and financial protection,
achieving very good health outcomes. On the other hand, the most unsustainable
systems located in central and eastern European countries.

characterized by multiple energy and temperature scales, most prominently the
Kondo temperature and the coherence temperature, characterizing the onset of
Kondo screening and the emergence of Fermi-liquid coherence, respectively. In
the standard setting of a wide conduction band, both scales depend
exponentially on the Kondo coupling. Here we discuss how the presence of flat,
i.e., dispersionless, conduction bands modifies this situation. Focussing on
the case of the kagome Kondo-lattice model, we utilize a parton mean-field
approach to determine the Kondo temperature and the coherence temperature as
function of the conduction-band filling $n_c$, both numerically and
analytically. For $n_c$ values corresponding to the flat conduction band
located at the Fermi level, we show that the exponential is replaced by a
linear dependence for the Kondo temperature and a quadratic dependence for the
coherence temperature, while a cubic law emerges for the coherence temperature
at $n_c$ corresponding to the band edge between the flat and dispersive bands.
We discuss implications of our results for pertinent experimental data.

history of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the nature of dark matter, but
its interpretation requires comparison to cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations. At high-$z$, convergence of these simulations is more exacting
since transmission is dominated by underdense voids that are challenging to
resolve. With evidence mounting for a late end to reionization, small
structures down to the sub-kpc level may survive to later times than
conventionally thought due to the reduced time for pressure smoothing to impact
the gas, further tightening simulation resolution requirements. We perform a
suite of simulations using the Eulerian cosmological hydrodynamics code Nyx,
spanning domain sizes of 1.25-10 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and 5-80 $h^{-1}$ kpc cells, and
explore the interaction of these variables with the timing of reionization on
the properties of the matter distribution and the simulated LAF at $z=5.5$. In
observable Ly$\alpha$ power, convergence within 10% is achieved for $k< 0.1$
s/km, but larger $k$ shows deviation of up to 20 percent. While a later
reionization retains more small structure in the density field, because of the
greater thermal broadening there is little difference in the convergence of LAF
power between early ($z=9$) and later ($z=6$) reionizations. We conclude that
at $z\sim5.5$, resolutions of 10 kpc are necessary for convergence of LAF power
at $k<0.1$ s/km, while higher-$k$ modes require higher resolution, and that the
timing of reionization does not significantly impact convergence given
realistic photoheating.

corrections are dependent upon the conformal frame in which the effective

studied in the Reinforcement Learning literature, little attention has been

Previous approaches use Monte Carlo cost estimates to avoid constraint

conservative performance with respect to costs. We propose Constrained MCTS
(C-MCTS), an algorithm that estimates cost using a safety critic. The safety
critic training is based on Temporal Difference learning in an offline phase
prior to agent deployment. This critic limits the exploration of the search
tree and removes unsafe trajectories within MCTS during deployment. C-MCTS
satisfies cost constraints but operates closer to the constraint boundary,
achieving higher rewards compared to previous work. As a nice byproduct, the
planner is more efficient requiring fewer planning steps. Most importantly, we
show that under model mismatch between the planner and the real world, our

learning (PbRL), a variant of conventional reinforcement learning that
dispenses with the need for online interaction or specification of reward
functions. Instead, the agent is provided with pre-existing offline
trajectories and human preferences between pairs of trajectories to extract the
dynamics and task information, respectively. Since the dynamics and task
information are orthogonal, a naive approach would involve using
preference-based reward learning followed by an off-the-shelf offline RL
algorithm. However, this requires the separate learning of a scalar reward
function, which is assumed to be an information bottleneck. To address this
issue, we propose the offline preference-guided policy optimization (OPPO)
paradigm, which models offline trajectories and preferences in a one-step
process, eliminating the need for separately learning a reward function. OPPO
achieves this by introducing an offline hindsight information matching
objective for optimizing a contextual policy and a preference modeling
objective for finding the optimal context. OPPO further integrates a
well-performing decision policy by optimizing the two objectives iteratively.
Our empirical results demonstrate that OPPO effectively models offline
preferences and outperforms prior competing baselines, including offline RL
algorithms performed over either true or pseudo reward function specifications.

the large-scale pre-trained diffusion models and many emerging personalization

engineering, and searching high-quality text prompts for customized results is
more art than science. Moreover, as commonly argued: ""an image is worth a
thousand words"" - the attempt to describe a desired image with texts often ends
up being ambiguous and cannot comprehensively cover delicate visual details,
hence necessitating more additional controls from the visual domain. In this
paper, we take a bold step forward: taking ""Text"" out of a pre-trained T2I
diffusion model, to reduce the burdensome prompt engineering efforts for users.
Our proposed framework, Prompt-Free Diffusion, relies on only visual inputs to
generate new images: it takes a reference image as ""context"", an optional image
structural conditioning, and an initial noise, with absolutely no text prompt.
The core architecture behind the scene is Semantic Context Encoder (SeeCoder),
substituting the commonly used CLIP-based or LLM-based text encoder. The
reusability of SeeCoder also makes it a convenient drop-in component: one can
also pre-train a SeeCoder in one T2I model and reuse it for another. Through
extensive experiments, Prompt-Free Diffusion is experimentally found to (i)
outperform prior exemplar-based image synthesis approaches; (ii) perform on par
with state-of-the-art T2I models using prompts following the best practice; and
(iii) be naturally extensible to other downstream applications such as anime
figure generation and virtual try-on, with promising quality. Our code and

preference, one agent is randomly selected, while the other agent is chosen
randomly with wealth just above or below the first agent. Through this
preference, we observe the emergence of a quasi-oligarchic society, where the

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of many machine learning (ML) methods depends crucially on having
large amounts of labeled data. However, obtaining enough labeled data can be
expensive, time-consuming, and subject to ethical constraints for many
applications. One approach that has shown tremendous value in addressing this
challenge is semi-supervised learning (SSL); this technique utilizes both
labeled and unlabeled data during training, often with much less labeled data
than unlabeled data, which is often relatively easy and inexpensive to obtain.
In fact, SSL methods are particularly useful in applications where the cost of
labeling data is especially expensive, such as medical analysis, natural
language processing (NLP), or speech recognition. A subset of SSL methods that
have achieved great success in various domains involves algorithms that
integrate graph-based techniques. These procedures are popular due to the vast
amount of information provided by the graphical framework and the versatility
of their applications. In this work, we propose an algebraic topology-based
semi-supervised method called persistent Laplacian-enhanced graph MBO (PL-MBO)
by integrating persistent spectral graph theory with the classical
Merriman-Bence- Osher (MBO) scheme. Specifically, we use a filtration procedure
to generate a sequence of chain complexes and associated families of simplicial
complexes, from which we construct a family of persistent Laplacians. Overall,
it is a very efficient procedure that requires much less labeled data to
perform well compared to many ML techniques, and it can be adapted for both
small and large datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on
data classification, and the results indicate that the proposed technique
outperforms other existing semi-supervised algorithms.

processes must follow in a concurrent system. When composing two or more
well-typed processes, a session typing system must check whether such processes
are multiparty compatible, a property that guarantees that all sent messages
are eventually received and no deadlock ever occurs. Previous work has shown
that duality and the more general notion of coherence are sufficient syntactic
conditions for guaranteeing the multiparty compatibility property. In this
paper, following a propositions-as-types fashion which relates session types to
linear logic, we generalise coherence to forwarders. Forwarders are processes
that act as middleware by forwarding messages according to a given protocol.
Our main result shows that forwarders not only generalise coherence, but fully
capture all well-typed multiparty compatible processes.

emotion-focused processes that partially bypass the recruitment of executive
functions. A case in point is acceptance-based strategies. To better understand
neural commonalities and differences behind different emotion regulation
strategies, in the present study we applied a meta-analytic method to fMRI
studies of task-related activity of reappraisal and acceptance. Results showed
increased activity in left-inferior frontal gyrus and insula for both
strategies, and decreased activity in the basal ganglia for reappraisal, and
decreased activity in limbic regions for acceptance. These findings are
discussed in the context of a model of common and specific neural mechanisms of
emotion regulation that support and expand the previous dual-routes models. We
suggest that emotion regulation may rely on a core inhibitory circuit, and on
strategy-specific top-down and bottom-up processes distinct for different

or sample a large volume of random spanning trees, thus are difficult to scale
to large graphs. In this work, we propose an improvement based on the
\textit{online relaxation} technique introduced by a series of works (Rakhlin
et al.,2012; Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2015; 2017). We first prove an effective
regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ when suitable parameterized graph
kernels are chosen, then propose an approximate algorithm FastONL enjoying
$\mathcal{O}(k\sqrt{n^{1+\gamma}})$ regret based on this relaxation. The key of
FastONL is a \textit{generalized local push} method that effectively
approximates inverse matrix columns and applies to a series of popular kernels.
Furthermore, the per-prediction cost is
$\mathcal{O}(\text{vol}({\mathcal{S}})\log 1/\epsilon)$ locally dependent on
the graph with linear memory cost. Experiments show that our scalable method
enjoys a better tradeoff between local and global consistency.

study of $\sim$2000 events in 2019-2020 characterizing the occurrence in
magnetic local time (MLT) and latitude of $\geq$50 keV electron isotropy

geomagnetic activity. The isotropy boundary for an electron of a given energy
is the magnetic latitude poleward of which persistent isotropized pitch-angle
distributions ($J_{prec}/J_{perp}\sim 1$) are first observed to occur,
interpreted as resulting from magnetic field-line curvature scattering (FLCS)
in the equatorial magnetosphere. We find that energetic electron IBs can be
well-recognized on the nightside from dusk until dawn, under all geomagnetic
activity conditions, with a peak occurrence rate of almost 90% near $\sim$22
hours in MLT, remaining above 80% from 21 to 01 MLT. The IBs span a wide range
of IGRF magnetic latitudes from $60^\circ$-$74^\circ$, with a maximum
occurrence between $66^\circ$-$71^\circ$ (L of 6-8), shifting to lower
latitudes and pre-midnight local times with activity. The precipitating energy
flux of $\geq$50 keV electrons averaged over the IB-associated latitudes varies
over four orders of magnitude, up to $\sim$1 erg/cm$^2$-s, and often includes
electron energies exceeding 1 MeV. The local time distribution of IB-associated
energies and precipitating fluxes also exhibit peak values near midnight for
low activity, shifting toward pre-midnight for elevated activity. The
percentage of the total energy deposited over the high-latitude regions
($55^\circ$ to $80^\circ$; or IGRF $L\gtrsim 3$) attributed to IBs is 10-20%,
on average, or about 10 MW of total atmospheric power input, but at times can
be up to $\sim$100% of the total $\geq$50 keV electron energy deposition over
the entire sub-auroral and auroral zone region, exceeding 1 GW in atmospheric

significant attention. By composing a Markovian process that starts in the data
domain and then gradually adds noise until reaching pure white noise, they
achieve superior performance in learning data distributions. Yet, these models
require a large number of diffusion steps to produce aesthetically pleasing
samples, which is inefficient. In addition, unlike common generative
adversarial networks, the latent space of diffusion models is not
interpretable. In this work, we propose to generalize the denoising diffusion

reduce the latent variable dimension in addition to the traditional noise level
addition. As a result, we are able to sample images of size $256\times 256$

compared to standard DDPMs. We formally develop the Markovian diffusion
processes of the UDPM, and demonstrate its generation capabilities on the
popular FFHQ, LSUN horses, ImageNet, and AFHQv2 datasets. Another favorable
property of UDPM is that it is very easy to interpolate its latent space, which

State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been

typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers
from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping
and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a
novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use
them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict
properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding
estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser.
With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to
solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for
memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed
kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional
spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate
spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of
market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training
Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility

with an unprecedented level of precision, that will require comparably good
accuracy. Current models for galaxy correlations rely on approximations and
idealizations that might be inadequate for ultra precise measurements. On the
other hand, exact calculations have proven to be computationally too expensive
to be efficiently implemented in real data analyses. We start a project to
provide precise and accurate formalisms for galaxy correlations, and in this
paper we investigate the 3D angular power spectrum including effects of unequal
time correlations. We establish an explicit link between the full- and flat-sky
spectra by performing an asymptotic expansion of the full-sky result around the
equal time case. The limiting case coincides with the idealized spectrum that a
meta-observer would measure if it had access to the entire 4D Universe. The
leading term in the obtained flat-sky expansion is the only translationally
invariant term in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight, while the
higher-order terms account for the deviation from this invariance. We study the
behavior of such corrections for a simplified universe where we can
analytically solve the power spectrum and have full control of the equations,
therefore being able to understand the exact nature of all the terms and the
origin of the corrections. We highlight that the conclusions and the structure
of the unequal time spectra are fully general and serve as lessons and guidance
in understanding galaxy clustering in any cosmology. Finally, we show that our
flat-sky unequal time expression matches the exact full-sky calculation
remarkably better than commonly adopted approximations, even at the largest
scales and for both shallow and deep redshift bins.

A
`flavour deconstruction' of the electroweak gauge symmetry, by promoting at
least part of it to the product of a third family factor (under which the Higgs
is charged) times a light family factor, allows one to address the flavour
puzzle at a low scale due to accidentally realised $U(2)^5$ flavour symmetries.
The unavoidable consequence is new heavy gauge bosons with direct couplings to
the Higgs, threatening the stability of the electroweak scale. In this work, we
propose a UV complete model of flavour based on deconstructing only
hypercharge. We find that the model satisfies finite naturalness criteria,
benefiting from the smallness of the hypercharge gauge coupling in controlling
radiative Higgs mass corrections and passing phenomenological bounds. Our setup
allows one to begin explaining flavour at the TeV scale, while dynamics solving
the large hierarchy problem can lie at a higher scale up to around 10 TeV -
without worsening the unavoidable little hierarchy problem. The low-energy
phenomenology of the model is dominated by a single $Z'$ gauge boson with
chiral and flavour non-universal couplings, with mass as light as a few TeV
thanks to the $U(2)^5$ symmetry. The natural parameter space of the model will
be probed by the HL-LHC and unavoidably leads to large positive shifts in the
$W$-boson mass, as well as an enhancement in $\text{Br}(B_{s,d} \to \mu^+
\mu^-)$. Finally, we show that a future electroweak precision machine such as
FCC-ee easily has the reach to fully exclude the model.

diffusion, capturing global scene-object and local inter-object relationships
while preserving shape diversity. The generated scenes can be manipulated by
editing the input scene graph and sampling the noise in the diffusion model.
Due to lacking a scene graph dataset offering high-quality object-level meshes

nonsmooth problems. While popular algorithms such as AdaGrad, Adam, or DoG
compute a running average of the squared gradients, DoWG maintains a new
distance-based weighted version of the running average, which is crucial to
achieve the desired properties. To our best knowledge, DoWG is the first
parameter-free, efficient, and universal algorithm that does not require
backtracking search procedures. It is also the first parameter-free AdaGrad
style algorithm that adapts to smooth optimization. To complement our theory,
we also show empirically that DoWG trains at the edge of stability, and
validate its effectiveness on practical machine learning tasks.
  This paper further uncovers the underlying principle behind the success of
the AdaGrad family of algorithms by presenting a novel analysis of Normalized
Gradient Descent (NGD), that shows NGD adapts to smoothness when it exists,
with no change to the stepsize. This establishes the universality of NGD and
partially explains the empirical observation that it trains at the edge of
stability in a much more general setup compared to standard gradient descent.
The latter might be of independent interest to the community.

consisting of a binary (GW~Ori\,A and B), a tertiary star (GW~Ori\,C) and a
rare circumtriple disk. Due to the limited data with poor accuracy, several
short-period signals were detected in this system, but the values from
different studies are not fully consistent. As one of the most successful
transiting surveys, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provides
an unprecedented opportunity to make a comprehensive periodic analysis of
GW~Ori. In this work we discover two significant modulation signals by
analyzing the light curves of GW~Ori's four observations from TESS, i.e., 3.02
$\pm$ 0.15\,d and 1.92 $\pm$ 0.06\,d, which are very likely to be the
rotational periods caused by starspot modulation on the primary and secondary
components, respectively. We calculate the inclinations of GW~Ori\,A and B
according to the two rotational periods. The results suggest that the
rotational plane of GW~Ori\,A and B and the orbital plane of the binary are
almost coplanar. We also discuss the aperiodic features in the light curves;
these may be related to unstable accretion. The light curves of GW~Ori also
include a third (possible) modulation signal with a period of 2.51$\pm$0.09\,d,
but the third is neither quite stable nor statistically significant.

establish a mobility edge by showing that the localized phase extends up to the

  When and How Much?",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Communication compression is a common technique in distributed optimization
that can alleviate communication overhead by transmitting compressed gradients
and model parameters. However, compression can introduce information
distortion, which slows down convergence and incurs more communication rounds
to achieve desired solutions. Given the trade-off between lower per-round
communication costs and additional rounds of communication, it is unclear
whether communication compression reduces the total communication cost.
  This paper explores the conditions under which unbiased compression, a widely
used form of compression, can reduce the total communication cost, as well as
the extent to which it can do so. To this end, we present the first theoretical
formulation for characterizing the total communication cost in distributed
optimization with communication compression. We demonstrate that unbiased
compression alone does not necessarily save the total communication cost, but
this outcome can be achieved if the compressors used by all workers are further
assumed independent. We establish lower bounds on the communication rounds
required by algorithms using independent unbiased compressors to minimize
smooth convex functions, and show that these lower bounds are tight by refining
the analysis for ADIANA. Our results reveal that using independent unbiased
compression can reduce the total communication cost by a factor of up to
$\Theta(\sqrt{\min\{n, \kappa\}})$, where $n$ is the number of workers and
$\kappa$ is the condition number of the functions being minimized. These
theoretical findings are supported by experimental results.

processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited
their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent
memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the
random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any
token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant
context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In
this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete
context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running
attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent
each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting
relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention
mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach
seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory
hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We
demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with
Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in
each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method
successfully extends its context length capacity up to 32k tokens, allowing for

arising in multi-agent systems with a wide range of applications. The problem's
intractability has led to extensive research on improving the scalability of
solvers for it. Since optimal solvers can struggle to scale, a major challenge
that arises is understanding what makes MAPF hard. We tackle this challenge
through a fine-grained complexity analysis of time-optimal MAPF on 2D grids,
thereby closing two gaps and identifying a new tractability frontier. First, we
show that 2-colored MAPF, i.e., where the agents are divided into two teams,
each with its own set of targets, remains NP-hard. Second, for the flowtime
objective (also called sum-of-costs), we show that it remains NP-hard to find a
solution in which agents have an individually optimal cost, which we call an
individually optimal solution. The previously tightest results for these MAPF
variants are for (non-grid) planar graphs. We use a single hardness
construction that replaces, strengthens, and unifies previous proofs. We
believe that it is also simpler than previous proofs for the planar case as it
employs minimal gadgets that enable its full visualization in one figure.
Finally, for the flowtime objective, we establish a tractability frontier based
on the number of directions agents can move in. Namely, we complement our
hardness result, which holds for three directions, with an efficient algorithm
for finding an individually optimal solution if only two directions are
allowed. This result sheds new light on the structure of optimal solutions,

Though this approach is more discriminative, for large-scale datasets the
computational cost is prohibitive since pre-computation of candidate embeddings
is no longer possible. We propose to combine the merits of both schemes using a

sampling, often taking 1000 sequential denoising steps for one sample. As a
result, considerable efforts have been directed toward reducing the number of

number of denoising steps (trading quality for speed), in this paper we explore
an orthogonal approach: can we run the denoising steps in parallel (trading
compute for speed)? In spite of the sequential nature of the denoising steps,
we show that surprisingly it is possible to parallelize sampling via Picard
iterations, by guessing the solution of future denoising steps and iteratively
refining until convergence. With this insight, we present ParaDiGMS, a novel
method to accelerate the sampling of pretrained diffusion models by denoising
multiple steps in parallel. ParaDiGMS is the first diffusion sampling method
that enables trading compute for speed and is even compatible with existing
fast sampling techniques such as DDIM and DPMSolver. Using ParaDiGMS, we
improve sampling speed by 2-4x across a range of robotics and image generation

e.g., language and audio, has evoked increasing attention in both industry and
academia. It is challenging for exploring the semantic alignment within
modalities and the visual correspondence across frames. However, existing
methods adopt separate network architectures for different modalities, and
neglect the inter-frame temporal interaction with references. In this paper, we
propose MUTR, a Multi-modal Unified Temporal transformer for Referring video
object segmentation. With a unified framework for the first time, MUTR adopts a
DETR-style transformer and is capable of segmenting video objects designated by
either text or audio reference. Specifically, we introduce two strategies to
fully explore the temporal relations between videos and multi-modal signals.
Firstly, for low-level temporal aggregation before the transformer, we enable
the multi-modal references to capture multi-scale visual cues from consecutive
video frames. This effectively endows the text or audio signals with temporal
knowledge and boosts the semantic alignment between modalities. Secondly, for
high-level temporal interaction after the transformer, we conduct inter-frame
feature communication for different object embeddings, contributing to better
object-wise correspondence for tracking along the video. On Ref-YouTube-VOS and
AVSBench datasets with respective text and audio references, MUTR achieves
+4.2% and +4.2% J&F improvements to state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating our
significance for unified multi-modal VOS. Code is released at

that these models face challenges in understanding such complex texts and

enable more control modes beyond text description. In this paper, we introduce
Uni-ControlNet, a novel approach that allows for the simultaneous utilization
of different local controls (e.g., edge maps, depth map, segmentation masks)
and global controls (e.g., CLIP image embeddings) in a flexible and composable

the fine-tuning of two additional adapters upon frozen pre-trained

scratch. Moreover, thanks to some dedicated adapter designs, Uni-ControlNet
only necessitates a constant number (i.e., 2) of adapters, regardless of the
number of local or global controls used. This not only reduces the fine-tuning
costs and model size, making it more suitable for real-world deployment, but
also facilitate composability of different conditions. Through both

Semiclassical dynamical simulations successfully recover the key features of

continuum of scattering near the (200) wave vector that extends from the

small-fluctuation theory for the spin-ice-like nematic ground states, analogous
to linear spin-wave theory for conventionally ordered magnets, which reproduces
the numerical simulation results quantitatively. In particular, we find that
the inelastic peak is well explained by collective modes confined to
ferromagnetic loops of the underlying nematic order. In addition, we find a
sharp, linearly dispersing mode in the dynamical structure factor, which

a decreasing trend with redshift compatible with a standard cosmological model,

fitting the median age-redshift relation with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model and

measurement of the diameter cannot be made through either occultation or direct
radar observation, the most common method is to approximate the diameter from
infrared observations. Once the diameter is known, a comparison with visible
light observations can be used to find the visible geometric albedo of the
body. One of the largest datasets of asteroid albedos comes from the NEOWISE
mission, which measured asteroid albedos both in the visible and infrared. We
model these albedos as a function of proper elements available from the
Asteroid Families Portal using an ensemble of neural networks. We find that
both the visible and infrared geometric albedos are significantly correlated
with asteroid position in the belt and occur in both asteroid families and in
the background belt. We find that the ensemble's prediction reduces the average
error in albedo by about 37% compared to a model that simply adopts an average
albedo, with no regard for the dynamical state of the body. We then use this
model to predict albedos for the half million main belt asteroids with proper

These inflows represent some of the most robust detections of inflowing gas
into isolated, star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our analysis suggests
that the inflows are due to recycling metal-enriched gas from previous
ejections. Comparisons between the galaxies with inflows and a larger parent
sample of 131 objects indicate that galaxies with detected inflows may have
higher specific star-formation rates (sSFR) and star-formation-rate surface
densities. However, when additional galaxies without robustly detected inflows
based on centroid velocity but whose LIS absorption line profiles indicate
large red-wing velocities are considered, galaxies with inflows do not show
unique properties relative to those lacking inflows. Additionally, we calculate
the covering fraction of cool inflowing gas as a function of red-wing inflow
velocity, finding an enhancement in high sSFR binned galaxies, likely due to an
increase in the amount of recycling gas. Together, these results suggest that
the low detection rate of galaxies with cool inflows is primarily related to
the viewing angle rather than the physical properties of the galaxies.

Topological phases in mixed quantum states, originating from decoherence in

recently garnered significant interest. Unlike pure states, mixed quantum
states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that keep the total
ensemble invariant but not on each individual state. It was realized that
symmetry-protected topological phases could be well-defined for such mixed

the main cause of dementia. Although many studies have been proposed targeting
at diagnosing dementia through spontaneous speech, there are still limitations.
Existing state-of-the-art approaches, which propose multimodal methods, train
separately language and acoustic models, employ majority-vote approaches, and
concatenate the representations of the different modalities either at the input
level, i.e., early fusion, or during training. Also, some of them employ
self-attention layers, which calculate the dependencies between representations
without considering the contextual information. In addition, no prior work has
taken into consideration the model calibration. To address these limitations,
we propose some new methods for detecting AD patients, which capture the intra-
and cross-modal interactions. First, we convert the audio files into log-Mel
spectrograms, their delta, and delta-delta and create in this way an image per
audio file consisting of three channels. Next, we pass each transcript and
image through BERT and DeiT models respectively. After that, context-based
self-attention layers, self-attention layers with a gate model, and optimal
transport domain adaptation methods are employed for capturing the intra- and
inter-modal interactions. Finally, we exploit two methods for fusing the self
and cross-attended features. For taking into account the model calibration, we
apply label smoothing. We use both performance and calibration metrics.
Experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate the efficacy of
our introduced approaches over existing research initiatives with our best
performing model reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 91.25% and 91.06%

explores the properties of the host galaxies of LISA MBHBs below

trees of the high-resolution N-body cosmological simulation

disc-dominated ($\rm B/T\,{<}\,0.7$) \textit{low-mass galaxies} of stellar
masses $10^8\,{-}\,10^9 M_{\odot}$. However, these properties are
indistinguishable from those of galaxies harboring single massive black holes
with comparable mass, making difficult the selection of LISA hosts among the
whole population of low-mass galaxies. Motivated by this, we explore the
possibility of using merger signatures to select LISA hosts. We find that
40-80% of the galaxies housing LISA MBHBs display merger features related to
the interaction which brought the secondary MBH to the galaxy. Despite this,
around 60% of dwarf galaxies placed in the surroundings of the LISA hosts will
show such kind of features as well, challenging the unequivocal detection of
LISA hosts through the search of merger signatures. Consequently, the detection
of an electromagnetic transient associated with the MBHB merger will be vital

address several of the shortcomings in previously published suboptimality
benchmarks. Two new sets of placement examples are constructed, one targeting
the role of nonlocal nets in suboptimality, and another targeting the role of
white space and large variations in module sizes. The first set, PEKO-MC, is a
set of standard-cell circuits with nonlocal nets in known optimal placements. A
given netlist is modified so as to render a given placement for it optimal for
the new netlist. Cell dimensions and locations are not changed, net-degree
statistics are matched exactly, and over 60% of the original netlist is left
unchanged. The second set, PEKO-MS, incorporates a parametrized percentage of
white space into a mixed-size placement which precisely matches given macro
dimensions and locations as well as the net-degree distributions of the ISPD
2005 benchmark suite [21]. HPWL for the placements generated for the PEKO-MS
circuits are proven to be less than 3% above optimal for most cases and within
8% of optimal on all cases.

Intermediate-Velocity Arch 1 (LLIV1). This was accomplished using archival H I
emission and absorption data from two 21,cm line surveys: GHIGLS at
$9.^\prime$4 resolution and DHIGLS at $1^\prime$ resolution. The spectral
decomposition code $\tt{ROHSA}$ was used to model the column density of
different thermal phases and also to analyze an absorption measurement against
the radio source 4C~+66.09. From the latter we found spin temperature
$T_{\mathrm{s}} \sim 75$K, cold gas mass fraction $f\sim0.5$, and turbulent
sonic Mach number $M_t\sim3.4$. Similar to the absorption line modeling against
4C~+66.09, our best emission line decomposition model has no unstable gas
across the whole field of view, suggesting that the thermal condensation and
phase transition are not on-going but rather have reached an equilibrium state.
The cold phase of LLIV1 appears as a collection of elongated filaments that
forms a closed structure within the field decomposed. These substructures
follow the orientation of the overall large scale cloud, along the diagonal of
the GHIGLS field from north-west to south-east (in Galactic coordinates). The
angular power spectrum of the cold phase is slightly shallower than that of the
warm phase, quantifying that the cold phases have relatively more structure on
small scales. Our spatially resolved map of the cold gas mass fraction in LLIV1
from DHIGLS reveals significant variations spanning the possible range of $f$,
with mean and standard deviation 0.33 and 0.19, respectively.

worst-case perturbations, their nominal performance under conventional
stochastic disturbances is often drastically reduced. Though this fundamental
tradeoff between nominal performance and robustness is known to exist, it is
not well-characterized in quantitative terms. Toward addressing this issue, we
borrow the increasingly ubiquitous notion of adversarial training from machine
learning to construct a class of controllers which are optimized for
disturbances consisting of mixed stochastic and worst-case components. We find
that this problem admits a linear time invariant optimal controller that has a
form closely related to suboptimal $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ solutions. We then
provide a quantitative performance-robustness tradeoff analysis in two
analytically tractable cases: state feedback control, and state estimation. In
these special cases, we demonstrate that the severity of the tradeoff depends
in an interpretable manner upon system-theoretic properties such as the
spectrum of the controllability gramian, the spectrum of the observability
gramian, and the stability of the system. This provides practitioners with
general guidance for determining how much robustness to incorporate based on a
priori system knowledge. We empirically validate our results by comparing the
performance of our controller against standard baselines, and plotting tradeoff
curves.

Reverse-Time Migration (LSRTM) is a common tool used to compute such images.
Still, its high computational costs have led seismologists to use
target-oriented LSRTM for imaging only a small target of interest within a
larger subsurface block. Redatuming the data to the upper boundary of the
target of interest is one approach to target-oriented LSRTM. Still, many
redatuming methods cannot account for multiple scatterings within the

potential of dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in assessing carpal
dynamics associated with this condition is a field of ongoing research. This
study contributes to this line of inquiry by developing MRI-derived carpal
kinematic metrics and investigating their stability. Methods: A previously
described 4D MRI approach for tracking the movements of carpal bones in the
wrist was deployed in this study. A panel of 120 metrics characterizing
radial/ulnar deviation and flexion extension movements was constructed by
fitting low order polynomial models of scaphoid and lunate degrees of freedom
against that of the capitate. Intraclass Correlation Coefficients were utilized
to analyze intra- and inter-subject stability within a mixed cohort of 49
subjects, including 20 with and 29 without a history of wrist injury. Results:
A comparable degree of stability across the two different wrist movements. Out
of the total 120 derived metrics, distinct subsets demonstrated high stability
within each type of movement. Among asymptomatic subjects, 16 out of 17 metrics
with high intra-subject stability also showed high inter-subject stability.
Interestingly, some quadratic term metrics, although relatively unstable within
asymptomatic subjects, showed increased stability within this group, hinting at
potential differentiation in their behavior across different cohorts.
Conclusion: This study showed the developing potential of dynamic MRI to
characterize complex carpal bone dynamics. Stability analyses of the derived
kinematic metrics showed encouraging differences between cohorts with and
without a history of wrist injury. Although these broad metric stability
variations highlight the potential utility of this approach for analysis of
carpal instability, further studies are necessary to better characterize these
observations.

they are liable to forget what they learned on previous tasks -- a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Proposed solutions to catastrophic forgetting
tend to involve storing information about past tasks, meaning that memory usage
is a chief consideration in determining their practicality. This paper proposes
a memory-efficient solution to catastrophic forgetting, improving upon an
established algorithm known as orthogonal gradient descent (OGD). OGD utilizes
prior model gradients to find weight updates that preserve performance on prior
datapoints. However, since the memory cost of storing prior model gradients
grows with the runtime of the algorithm, OGD is ill-suited to continual
learning over arbitrarily long time horizons. To address this problem, this
paper proposes SketchOGD. SketchOGD employs an online sketching algorithm to
compress model gradients as they are encountered into a matrix of a fixed,
user-determined size. In contrast to existing memory-efficient variants of OGD,
SketchOGD runs online without the need for advance knowledge of the total
number of tasks, is simple to implement, and is more amenable to analysis. We
provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of the relevant
sketches under a novel metric suited to the downstream task of OGD.
Experimentally, we find that SketchOGD tends to outperform current
state-of-the-art variants of OGD given a fixed memory budget.

quantization errors. To address these issues, we present the KeyPoint
Positioning System (KeyPosS), a groundbreaking facial landmark detection
framework that stands out from existing methods. For the first time, KeyPosS
employs the True-range Multilateration algorithm, a technique originally used
in GPS systems, to achieve rapid and precise facial landmark detection without
relying on computationally intensive regression approaches. The framework
utilizes a fully convolutional network to predict a distance map, which
computes the distance between a Point of Interest (POI) and multiple anchor
points. These anchor points are ingeniously harnessed to triangulate the POI's
position through the True-range Multilateration algorithm. Notably, the
plug-and-play nature of KeyPosS enables seamless integration into any decoding
stage, ensuring a versatile and adaptable solution. We conducted a thorough
evaluation of KeyPosS's performance by benchmarking it against state-of-the-art
models on four different datasets. The results show that KeyPosS substantially
outperforms leading methods in low-resolution settings while requiring a

fundamental problems in robust optimization. In the problem, we are given a
directed graph with $n$ vertices and $k$ distinct cost functions (scenarios)
defined over edges, and aim to choose an $s$-$t$ path such that the total cost
of the path is always provable no matter which scenario is realized. With the
view of each cost function being associated with an agent, our goal is to find
a common $s$-$t$ path minimizing the maximum objective among all agents, and
thus create a fair solution for them. The problem is hard to approximate within
$o(\log k)$ by any quasi-polynomial time algorithm unless $\mathrm{NP}
\subseteq \mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}\log n})$, and the best approximation
ratio known to date is $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ which is based on the natural
flow linear program. A longstanding open question is whether we can achieve a
polylogarithmic approximation even when a quasi-polynomial running time is
allowed.
  We give the first polylogarithmic approximation for robust $s$-$t$ path since
the problem was proposed more than two decades ago. In particular, we introduce
a $O(\log n \log k)$-approximate algorithm running in quasi-polynomial time.
The algorithm is built on a novel linear program formulation for a
decision-tree-type structure which enables us to get rid of the
$\Omega(\max\{k,\sqrt{n}\})$ integrality gap of the natural flow LP. Further,
we also consider some well-known graph classes, e.g., graphs with bounded
treewidth, and show that the polylogarithmic approximation can be achieved
polynomially on these graphs. We hope the new proposed techniques in the paper
can offer new insights into the robust $s$-$t$ path problem and related

nuclei exhibiting shape coexistence. Mixing of configurations can be studied by
measuring the monopole strength $\rho^2(E0)$, however, currently the
experimental information is scarce and lacks precision, especially for the
$I^\pi \rightarrow I^\pi$ ($I \neq 0$) transitions. Purpose: The goals of this
study were to increase the precision of the known branching ratios and internal
conversion coefficients, to increase the amount of available information
regarding excited states in $^{182,184,186}$Hg and to interpret the results in
the framework of shape coexistence using different models. Method: The
low-energy structures in $^{182,184,186}$Hg were populated in the $\beta$ decay
of $^{182,184,186}$Tl, produced at ISOLDE and purified by laser ionization and
mass separation. The $\gamma$-ray and internal conversion electron events were
detected by five germanium clover detectors and a segmented silicon detector,
respectively, and correlated in time to build decay schemes. Results: In total,
193, 178 and 156 transitions, including 144, 140 and 108 observed for the first
time in a $\beta$-decay experiment, were assigned to $^{182,184,186}$Hg,

transitions, out of which 12 had an $E0$ component. Extracted branching ratios
allowed the sign of the interference term in $^{182}$Hg as well as
$\rho^2(E0;0^+_2\rightarrow 0^+_1)$ and $B(E2;0^+_2\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ in
$^{184}$Hg to be determined. By means of electron-electron coincidences, the
$0^+_3$ state was identified in $^{184}$Hg. The experimental results were
qualitatively reproduced by five theoretical approaches, the IBM with
configuration mixing with two different parametrizations, the General Bohr
Hamiltonian, the BMF model and the SCCM model. However, a quantitative
description is lacking.

face verification and used it to compare humans and two state-of-the-art face
recognition systems. Pairs of same- and different-identity faces of White and
Black individuals were selected to be difficult for humans and an open-source
implementation of the ArcFace face recognition algorithm from 2019 (5). Human
participants (54 Black; 51 White) judged whether face pairs showed the same

top-performing face recognition systems from the Face Recognition Vendor
Test-ongoing performed the same test (7). By design, the test proved
challenging for humans as a group, who performed above chance, but far less
than perfect. Both state-of-the-art face recognition systems scored perfectly
(no errors), consequently with equal accuracy for both races. We conclude that
state-of-the-art systems for identity verification between two frontal face
images of Black and White individuals can surpass the general population.
Whether this result generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images is a pressing
concern for deploying face recognition systems in unconstrained environments.

embeds the data distributions in an RKHS and exploits the spectrum of the

Fourier features. This estimator is flexible, scalable, differentiable, and
suitable for minibatch-based optimization problems. Additionally, we provide an
estimator based on kernel matrices without having an explicit mapping to the
RKHS. We show that this quantity is a lower bound on the Jensen-Shannon

our divergence to two-sample testing outperforming related state-of-the-art

this paper, we prove a non-trivial upper bound in the case of trees:
$\sigma^-(T)\leq \left \lceil \frac{n}{2}\right \rceil$, where $T$ is a tree of

Until now, numerous virtual systems had been developed for digital

range from virtual gaming to social networks. However, the majority of these
systems lack to maintain consistency during interconnectivity and
communication. To explore this discussion, in the recent past a new term,
Metaverse has been introduced, which is the combination of meta and universe
that describes a shared virtual environment, where a number of technologies,
such as 4th and 5th generation technologies, VR, ML algorithms etc., work
collectively to support each other for the sake of one objective, which is the
virtual accessibility of objects via one network platform. With the
development, integration, and virtualization of technologies, a lot of
improvement in daily life applications is expected, but at the same time, there
is a big challenge for the research community to secure this platform from
external and external threats, because this technology is exposed to many
cybersecurity attacks. Hence, it is imperative to systematically review and
understand the taxonomy, applications, open security challenges, and future
research directions of the emerging Metaverse technologies. In this paper, we
have made useful efforts to present a comprehensive survey regarding Metaverse
technology by taking into account the aforesaid parameters. Following this, in
the initial phase, we explored the future of Metaverse in the presence of 4th
and 5th generation technologies. Thereafter, we discussed the possible attacks
to set a preface for the open security challenges. Based on that, we suggested
potential research directions that could be beneficial to address these
challenges cost-effectively.

used in various applications, including manufacturing systems, communication

accelerates learning by generating augmented data samples. The proposed
algorithm is data-driven and learns the policy from data samples from both real

the sample complexity such that the dataset only needs to have sufficient

proposed method under Fitted Q Iteration (FQI) and demonstrate that the
optimality gap decreases as
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{{1}/{n}}+\sqrt{{1}/{m}}),$ where $n$ is the number

is important to note that without augmented samples, the optimality gap is
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ due to insufficient data coverage of the

applications confirm that the proposed method indeed significantly accelerates

learning the residual stochastic, stationary components. Recently, it has been
shown that one can learn the deterministic non-stationary components accurately
using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis (mSSA) in the absence of a
correlated stationary component; meanwhile, in the absence of deterministic
non-stationary components, the Autoregressive (AR) stationary component can
also be learnt readily, e.g. via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). However, a
theoretical underpinning of multi-stage learning algorithms involving both
deterministic and stationary components has been absent in the literature
despite its pervasiveness. We resolve this open question by establishing
desirable theoretical guarantees for a natural two-stage algorithm, where mSSA
is first applied to estimate the non-stationary components despite the presence
of a correlated stationary AR component, which is subsequently learned from the
residual time series. We provide a finite-sample forecasting consistency bound
for the proposed algorithm, SAMoSSA, which is data-driven and thus requires
minimal parameter tuning. To establish theoretical guarantees, we overcome
three hurdles: (i) we characterize the spectra of Page matrices of stable AR
processes, thus extending the analysis of mSSA; (ii) we extend the analysis of
AR process identification in the presence of arbitrary bounded perturbations;
(iii) we characterize the out-of-sample or forecasting error, as opposed to
solely considering model identification. Through representative empirical
studies, we validate the superior performance of SAMoSSA compared to existing
baselines. Notably, SAMoSSA's ability to account for AR noise structure yields
improvements ranging from 5% to 37% across various benchmark datasets.

variations of natural examples crafted to deliberately mislead the models.
While they can be easily generated using gradient-based techniques in digital

stealthiness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework dubbed
Diffusion-Based Projected Gradient Descent (Diff-PGD) for generating realistic
adversarial samples. By exploiting a gradient guided by a diffusion model,
Diff-PGD ensures that adversarial samples remain close to the original data
distribution while maintaining their effectiveness. Moreover, our framework can
be easily customized for specific tasks such as digital attacks, physical-world
attacks, and style-based attacks. Compared with existing methods for generating
natural-style adversarial samples, our framework enables the separation of
optimizing adversarial loss from other surrogate losses (e.g.,
content/smoothness/style loss), making it more stable and controllable.
Finally, we demonstrate that the samples generated using Diff-PGD have better
transferability and anti-purification power than traditional gradient-based

Neuroevolution could be an effective and efficient solution to this problem, as

Critical to this description is the choice of boundary conditions, which
ultimately stems from the choice of hydrodynamic variables in terms of
condensate degrees of freedom. Given the gapped nature of bulk, one would
expect dissipation effects to play an important role only near the FQH edge.
Thus, one envisions a scenario where the bulk hydro equations remain
unmodified, while the dissipation effects are introduced at the edge via
boundary conditions. We have recently shown that the anomaly requirements fix
the boundary conditions of the FQH fluid to be no-penetration and no-stress

no-stress boundary condition leading to charge diffusion at the boundary. The
resulting dissipative edge dynamics is quite rigid from a hydro perspective, as
it has to preserve the edge charge continuity and the anomaly structure. We

dynamic light scattering, {\zeta}-potential, and thermal gravimetric analysis.
Liquid surface X-ray reflectivity (XR) and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray

and in-plane structure of the AuNP assembly across and on the aqueous surface.
  {\bf Findings:} The assembly of PEG-AuNPs at the liquid/vapor interface can
be tuned by adjusting pH or salinity, particularly for COOH terminals. However,
the effect is less pronounced for NH2 terminals. These distinct assembly
behaviors are attributed to the overall charge of PEG-AuNPs and the
conformation of PEG. The COOH-PEG corona is the most compact, resulting in
smaller superlattice constants. The net charge per particle depends not only on
the PEG terminal groups but also on the cation sequestration of PEG and the

the model is applied to the helium atom using the {\tt NewStock} atomic

comparison with astronomical observations. Approaching these models on a small
scale, we analyze the images generated on the lens plane by obtaining the
analytical scaled surface mass densities $\Sigma_{*}(x)$ and their
corresponding deflection angles $\alpha_{*}(x)$, for later applying a method
for ray tracing using the gravitational refraction law. The method is able to
locate the positions of the images on the lens plane, by mapping fringes that
represent possible sources (such as other galaxies), placed on the source
plane. The regions where the strong lensing occurs for each profile, are
determined by fixing the $\lambda$ parameter that establishes the ray tracing
process. It is shown that the presence of Einstein rings generated by each
profile is directly related with the central branch of the caustic. This method
gives us a possible alternative way to distinguish between different DM
candidates by observing imaging from external sources.

disjoint union $\sqcup$ is the usual categorical coproduct, the Cartesian
product $\times$ becomes a restriction categorical analogue of the categorical
product: a restriction product. Nevertheless, $\mathsf{PAR}$ does have a usual
categorical product as well in the form of $A \sqcup B \sqcup (A \times B)$.
Surprisingly, asking that a distributive restriction category (a restriction
category with restriction products $\times$ and coproducts $\oplus$) has $A
\oplus B \oplus (A \times B)$ a categorical product is enough to imply that the
category is a classical restriction category. This is a restriction category
which has joins and relative complements and so supports classical Boolean
reasoning. The first and main observation of the paper is that a distributive
restriction category is classical if and only if $A \& B := A \oplus B \oplus
(A \times B)$ is a categorical product in which case we call $\&$ the
``classical'' product. In fact, a distributive restriction category has a
categorical product if and only if it is a classified restriction category.
This is in the sense that every map $A \to B$ factors uniquely through a total
map $A \to B \oplus \mathsf{1}$, where $\mathsf{1}$ is the restriction terminal
object. This implies the second significant observation of the paper, namely,
that a distributive restriction category has a classical product if and only if
it is the Kleisli category of the exception monad $\_ \oplus \mathsf{1}$ for an
ordinary distributive category. Thus having a classical product has a
significant structural effect on a distributive restriction category. In
particular, the classical product not only provides an alternative
axiomatization for being classical but also for being the Kleisli category of
the exception monad on an ordinary distributive category.

is to avoid materializing the set of all join answers, and to achieve
quasilinear time in the size of the database, regardless of the total number of
answers. A recent dichotomy result rules out the existence of such an algorithm
for a general family of queries and orders. Specifically, for acyclic JQs
without self-joins, the problem becomes intractable for ordering by sum
whenever we join more than two relations (and these joins are not trivial
intersections). Moreover, even for basic ranking functions beyond sum, such as
min or max over different attributes, so far it is not known whether there is
any nontrivial tractable %JQ. In this work, we develop a new approach to
solving %JQ. Our solution uses two subroutines: The first one needs to select
what we call a ""pivot answer"". The second subroutine partitions the space of
query answers according to this pivot, and continues searching in one partition
that is represented as new %JQ over a new database. For pivot selection, we
develop an algorithm that works for a large class of ranking functions that are
appropriately monotone. The second subroutine requires a customized
construction for the specific ranking function at hand. We show the benefit and
generality of our approach by using it to establish several new complexity
results. First, we prove the tractability of min and max for all acyclic JQs,
thereby resolving the above question. Second, we extend the previous %JQ
dichotomy for sum to all partial sums. Third, we handle the intractable cases
of sum by devising a deterministic approximation scheme that applies to every

estimate the uncertainty associated with a QoI from low-fidelity (LF) and
high-fidelity (HF) samples of the QoI. This model allows for the approximation
of the statistics of the HF QoI by leveraging information derived from its LF
counterpart. Specifically, we design a bi-fidelity auto-regressive model in the
latent space that is integrated within the VAE's probabilistic encoder-decoder
structure. An effective algorithm is proposed to maximize the variational lower
bound of the HF log-likelihood in the presence of limited HF data, resulting in
the synthesis of HF realizations with a reduced computational cost.
Additionally, we introduce the concept of the bi-fidelity information
bottleneck (BF-IB) to provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the

considerably improved accuracy, as compared to a VAE trained using only HF data

  Weight Decay Regularization",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained to minimize a loss term plus the sum of
squared weights via gradient descent corresponds to the common approach of
training with weight decay. This paper provides new insights into this common
learning framework. We characterize the kinds of functions learned by training
with weight decay for multi-output (vector-valued) ReLU neural networks. This
extends previous characterizations that were limited to single-output
(scalar-valued) networks. This characterization requires the definition of a
new class of neural function spaces that we call vector-valued variation (VV)
spaces. We prove that neural networks (NNs) are optimal solutions to learning
problems posed over VV spaces via a novel representer theorem. This new
representer theorem shows that solutions to these learning problems exist as
vector-valued neural networks with widths bounded in terms of the number of
training data. Next, via a novel connection to the multi-task lasso problem, we
derive new and tighter bounds on the widths of homogeneous layers in DNNs. The
bounds are determined by the effective dimensions of the training data
embeddings in/out of the layers. This result sheds new light on the
architectural requirements for DNNs. Finally, the connection to the multi-task
lasso problem suggests a new approach to compressing pre-trained networks.

multiple data streams required to develop global understanding. Additionally,

this white paper we highlight some of the 21$^\mathsf{st}$ century challenges

make recommendations for important steps the field can take to modernize its
data products and data usage models. Our specific recommendations include: (1)
Investing in data assimilation capability to drive advanced data-constrained

representation learning, with or without label supervision. However, supervised
CL is prone to collapsing representations of subclasses within a class by not

class-relevant features by focusing on learning easy class-irrelevant features;
both significantly compromise representation quality. Yet, there is no
theoretical understanding of \textit{class collapse} or \textit{feature

rigorous framework to determine \textit{which} features are learnt by CL. Our

descent towards finding simpler solutions is a key factor in collapsing
subclass representations and suppressing harder class-relevant features.
Moreover, we present increasing embedding dimensionality and improving the

from them. Therefore, we introduce a new dataset, called Cattle Visual
Behaviors (CVB), that consists of 502 video clips, each fifteen seconds long,
captured in natural lighting conditions, and annotated with eleven visually
perceptible behaviors of grazing cattle. We use the Computer Vision Annotation
Tool (CVAT) to collect our annotations. To make the procedure more efficient,
we perform an initial detection and tracking of cattle in the videos using
appropriate pre-trained models. The results are corrected by domain experts
along with cattle behavior labeling in CVAT. The pre-hoc detection and tracking
step significantly reduces the manual annotation time and effort. Moreover, we
convert CVB to the atomic visual action (AVA) format and train and evaluate the
popular SlowFast action recognition model on it. The associated preliminary
results confirm that we can localize the cattle and recognize their frequently
occurring behaviors with confidence. By creating and sharing CVB, our aim is to
develop improved models capable of recognizing all important behaviors
accurately and to assist other researchers and practitioners in developing and
evaluating new ML models for cattle behavior classification using video data.

caption, the goal is to rank candidate images by relevance, from large to
small. The current ITR datasets are constructed in a pairwise manner.
Image-text pairs are annotated as positive or negative. Correspondingly, ITR
models mainly use pairwise losses, such as triplet loss, to learn to rank.
Pairwise-based ITR increases positive pair similarity while decreasing negative
pair similarity indiscriminately. However, the relevance between dissimilar
negative pairs is different. Pairwise annotations cannot reflect this
difference in relevance. In the current datasets, pairwise annotations miss
many correlations. There are many potential positive pairs among the pairs
labeled as negative. Pairwise-based ITR can only rank positive samples before
negative samples, but cannot rank negative samples by relevance. In this paper,
we integrate listwise ranking into conventional pairwise-based ITR. Listwise
ranking optimizes the entire ranking list based on relevance scores.
Specifically, we first propose a Relevance Score Calculation (RSC) module to
calculate the relevance score of the entire ranked list. Then we choose the
ranking metric, Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), as the
optimization objective. We transform the non-differentiable NDCG into a
differentiable listwise loss, named Smooth-NDCG (S-NDCG). Our listwise ranking
approach can be plug-and-play integrated into current pairwise-based ITR
models. Experiments on ITR benchmarks show that integrating listwise ranking
can improve the performance of current ITR models and provide more

researchers have discovered the potential of Chain-of-thought (CoT) to assist

However, human thought processes are often non-linear, rather than simply
sequential chains of thoughts. Therefore, we propose Graph-of-Thought (GoT)
reasoning, which models human thought processes not only as a chain but also as
a graph. By representing thought units as nodes and connections between them as
edges, our approach captures the non-sequential nature of human thinking and
allows for a more realistic modeling of thought processes. Similar to
Multimodal-CoT, we modeled GoT reasoning as a two-stage framework, generating
rationales first and then producing the final answer. Specifically, we employ
an additional graph-of-thoughts encoder for GoT representation learning and
fuse the GoT representation with the original input representation through a

allowable bluntness), along with the aft-wedge angle varying between {\theta}2
= 450 and 600. Noticeably, even a small bluntness ratio can completely change
the shock interaction pattern compared to its sharp geometrical counterpart due
to a detached leading edge shock, enlarged separation bubble, and location of
various shock-waves concerning it. Critical bluntness ratios exist for the low

reduce the sim-to-real gap in practice. We adopt the framework of
distributionally robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), aimed at learning a
policy that optimizes the worst-case performance when the deployed environment
falls within a prescribed uncertainty set around the nominal MDP. Despite
recent efforts, the sample complexity of RMDPs remained mostly unsettled
regardless of the uncertainty set in use. It was unclear if distributional
robustness bears any statistical consequences when benchmarked against standard
RL.
  Assuming access to a generative model that draws samples based on the nominal
MDP, we characterize the sample complexity of RMDPs when the uncertainty set is
specified via either the total variation (TV) distance or $\chi^2$ divergence.
The algorithm studied here is a model-based method called {\em distributionally
robust value iteration}, which is shown to be near-optimal for the full range
of uncertainty levels. Somewhat surprisingly, our results uncover that RMDPs
are not necessarily easier or harder to learn than standard MDPs. The
statistical consequence incurred by the robustness requirement depends heavily
on the size and shape of the uncertainty set: in the case w.r.t.~the TV
distance, the minimax sample complexity of RMDPs is always smaller than that of
standard MDPs; in the case w.r.t.~the $\chi^2$ divergence, the sample
complexity of RMDPs can often far exceed the standard MDP counterpart.

high-frequency surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to the low-frequency
body joint motion controlled by the MSK and muscle contraction dynamics. The
proposed method utilizes the fast wavelet transform to decompose the mixed
frequency input sEMG and output joint motion signals into nested
multi-resolution signals. The prediction model is subsequently trained on
coarser-scale input-output signals using a gated recurrent unit (GRU), and then
the trained parameters are transferred to the next level of training with
finer-scale signals. These training processes are repeated recursively under a
transfer-learning fashion until the full-scale training (i.e., with unfiltered

Numerical examples on recorded subject data demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework in generating a physics-informed forward-dynamics

remarkable generalization skills through prompting, particularly in zero-shot

the search space can be exceptionally large. It can require reasoning over
several combinations of elementary concepts to arrive at an inference, which
severely restricts the performance of such models. To tackle this challenging
problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called ALGO - novel Action
Learning with Grounded Object recognition that can use symbolic knowledge
stored in large-scale knowledge bases to infer activities (verb-noun

First, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic prompting approach that uses
object-centric vision-language foundation models as a noisy oracle to ground

symbolic pattern theory framework and learn to ground knowledge-based action

rate and frequency of motion of an actual physical system. The latter
possibility is linked to the optimal sampling regime being a universal
crossover separating two distinct suboptimal sampling regimes analogous to the
physical phenomena of diffusion and effusion, respectively. Bound states break
symmetry; one may thus regard the pseudo-time as a quantity emerging together
with the bound state. Conversely, when transport among distinct bound states
takes place -- thus restoring symmetry -- a pseudo-time can no longer be
defined. One can still quantify activation barriers, if the latter barriers are
smooth, but the simulation becomes impractically slow and pertains to
overdamped transport only. Specially designed Monte Carlo moves that bypass
activation barriers -- so as to accelerate sampling of the thermodynamics --
amount to effusive transport and lead to severe under-sampling of
transition-state configurations that separate distinct bound states while
destroying the said universality. Implications of the present findings for
simulations of glassy liquids are discussed.

including search engines, recommender systems, etc. Modern ranking systems are
often constructed with learning-to-rank (LTR) models built from user behavior
signals. While previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using
user behavior signals (e.g., clicks) as both features and labels of LTR
algorithms, we argue that existing LTR algorithms that indiscriminately treat
behavior and non-behavior signals in input features could lead to suboptimal
performance in practice. Particularly because user behavior signals often have
strong correlations with the ranking objective and can only be collected on
items that have already been shown to users, directly using behavior signals in
LTR could create an exploitation bias that hurts the system performance in the
long run.
  To address the exploitation bias, we propose EBRank, an empirical Bayes-based
uncertainty-aware ranking algorithm. Specifically, to overcome exploitation
bias brought by behavior features in ranking models, EBRank uses a sole
non-behavior feature based prior model to get a prior estimation of relevance.
In the dynamic training and serving of ranking systems, EBRank uses the
observed user behaviors to update posterior relevance estimation instead of
concatenating behaviors as features in ranking models. Besides, EBRank
additionally applies an uncertainty-aware exploration strategy to explore
actively, collect user behaviors for empirical Bayesian modeling and improve
ranking performance. Experiments on three public datasets show that EBRank is
effective, practical and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking
algorithms.

AIBugHunter helps software developers to achieve real-time vulnerability
detection, explanation, and repairs during programming. In particular,
AIBugHunter scans through developers' source code to (1) locate
vulnerabilities, (2) identify vulnerability types, (3) estimate vulnerability
severity, and (4) suggest vulnerability repairs. In this article, we propose a
novel multi-objective optimization (MOO)-based vulnerability classification
approach and a transformer-based estimation approach to help AIBugHunter
accurately identify vulnerability types and estimate severity. Our empirical
experiments on a large dataset consisting of 188K+ C/C++ functions confirm that
our proposed approaches are more accurate than other state-of-the-art baseline
methods for vulnerability classification and estimation. Furthermore, we
conduct qualitative evaluations including a survey study and a user study to
obtain software practitioners' perceptions of our AIBugHunter tool and assess
the impact that AIBugHunter may have on developers' productivity in security
aspects. Our survey study shows that our AIBugHunter is perceived as useful
where 90% of the participants consider adopting our AIBugHunter. Last but not
least, our user study shows that our AIBugHunter could possibly enhance
developers' productivity in combating cybersecurity issues during software

overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel concept of channel-wise
confidence in a node feature, which is assigned to each imputed channel feature
of a node for reflecting certainty of the imputation. We then design
pseudo-confidence using the channel-wise shortest path distance between a
missing-feature node and its nearest known-feature node to replace unavailable
true confidence in an actual learning process. Based on the pseudo-confidence,
we propose a novel feature imputation scheme that performs channel-wise
inter-node diffusion and node-wise inter-channel propagation. The scheme can
endure even at an exceedingly high missing rate (e.g., 99.5\%) and it achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy for both semi-supervised node classification and link
prediction on various datasets containing a high rate of missing features.

robustness. Usually, most predictions are deterministic estimates of future
states which are over-confident and prone to error. Recently, few works have
addressed capturing uncertainty during forecasting of future states. However,
these probabilistic estimation methods fail to account for the upstream noise
in perception data during tracking. Sensors always have noise and state
estimation becomes even more difficult under adverse weather conditions and
occlusion. Traditionally, Bayes filters have been used to fuse information from
noisy sensors to update states with associated belief. But, they fail to
address non-linearities and long-term predictions. Therefore, we propose an
end-to-end estimator that can take noisy sensor measurements and make robust
future state predictions with uncertainty bounds while simultaneously taking
into consideration the upstream perceptual uncertainty. For the current
research, we consider an encoder-decoder based deep ensemble network for
capturing both perception and predictive uncertainty simultaneously. We
compared the current model to other approximate Bayesian inference methods.
Overall, deep ensembles provided more robust predictions and the consideration
of upstream uncertainty further increased the estimation accuracy for the

input uncertainty comes from the Physical Model Parameters (PMPs), and accurate
uncertainty quantification in these input parameters is crucial for validating
nuclear reactor systems within the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU)
framework. Inverse Uncertainty Quantification (IUQ) method has been used to
quantify the uncertainty of PMPs from a Bayesian perspective. This paper
introduces a novel hierarchical Bayesian model for IUQ which aims to mitigate
two existing challenges: the high variability of PMPs under varying
experimental conditions, and unknown model discrepancies or outliers causing
over-fitting issues for the PMPs.
  The proposed hierarchical model is compared with the conventional
single-level Bayesian model based on the PMPs in TRACE using the measured void
fraction data in the Boiling Water Reactor Full-size Fine-mesh Bundle Test

is used for posterior sampling in the hierarchical structure. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical structure in
providing better estimates of the posterior distributions of PMPs and being
less prone to over-fitting. The proposed hierarchical model also demonstrates a
promising approach for generalizing IUQ to larger databases with a broad range
of experimental conditions and different geometric setups.

recover Run 1 single-lepton trigger thresholds while operating comfortably
under Run 3 sustained pileup conditions. A fourth pixel layer 3.3 cm from the
beam axis was added before Run 2 to improve vertex reconstruction and
$b$-tagging performance. New Liquid Argon Calorimeter digital trigger
electronics, with corresponding upgrades to the Trigger and Data Acquisition
system, take advantage of a factor of 10 finer granularity to improve
triggering on electrons, photons, taus, and hadronic signatures through
increased pileup rejection. The inner muon endcap wheels were replaced by New
Small Wheels with Micromegas and small-strip Thin Gap Chamber detectors,
providing both precision tracking and Level-1 Muon trigger functionality. Tile
Calorimeter scintillation counters were added to improve electron energy
resolution and background rejection. Upgrades to Minimum Bias Trigger
Scintillators and Forward Detectors improve luminosity monitoring and enable
total proton-proton cross section, diffractive physics, and heavy ion

an off-the-shelf LM, even when it is impossible for the LM itself to reliably
solve the task. By training a student model on the generated dataset and
amplifying its capability through self-distillation, our method yields a
high-quality model and dataset from a low-quality teacher model, without the
need for scale or supervision. Using Impossible Distillation, we are able to
distill an order of magnitude smaller model (with only 770M parameters) that
outperforms 175B parameter GPT-3, in both quality and controllability, as
confirmed by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, as a useful
byproduct of our approach, we obtain DIMSUM+, a high-quality dataset with 3.4M
sentence summaries and paraphrases. Our analyses show that this dataset, as a

generalization to unseen domains than all human-authored datasets -- including

applications, such as search engines and recommender systems. Besides the
ranking relevance to users, the exposure fairness to item providers has also
been considered an important factor in ranking optimization. Many fair ranking
algorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and
fairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy
algorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or
request. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper
bound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long
term. To this end, we propose FARA, a novel Future-Aware Ranking Algorithm for
ranking relevance and fairness optimization. Instead of greedily optimizing
rankings for the next immediate session, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing
multiple ranklists together and saving them for future sessions. Particularly,
FARA first uses the Taylor expansion to investigate how future ranklists will
influence the overall fairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of
the Taylor expansion, FARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we
first solve an optimal future exposure planning problem and then construct the
optimal ranklists according to the optimal future exposure planning.
Theoretically, we show that FARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness
joint optimization. Empirically, our extensive experiments on three
semi-synthesized datasets show that FARA is efficient, effective, and can
deliver significantly better ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art
fair ranking methods.

The efficacy of position encoding in time series analysis is not well-studied

position encoding or relative position encoding, or a combination of them. In
order to clarify this, we first review existing absolute and relative position
encoding methods when applied in time series classification. We then proposed a
new absolute position encoding method dedicated to time series data called time
Absolute Position Encoding (tAPE). Our new method incorporates the series
length and input embedding dimension in absolute position encoding.
Additionally, we propose computationally Efficient implementation of Relative
Position Encoding (eRPE) to improve generalisability for time series. We then
propose a novel multivariate time series classification (MTSC) model combining
tAPE/eRPE and convolution-based input encoding named ConvTran to improve the
position and data embedding of time series data. The proposed absolute and
relative position encoding methods are simple and efficient. They can be easily
integrated into transformer blocks and used for downstream tasks such as

defined a new measure of entanglement based on the method of SPA-PT, which we

to quantify entanglement for negative partial transposed entangled states

galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with the CALorimetric Electron Telescope onboard
the International Space Station over 6 yr, corresponding to the positive
polarity of the solar magnetic field. The observed variation of proton count
rate is consistent with the neutron monitor count rate, validating our methods
for determining the proton count rate. It is observed by the CALorimetric
Electron Telescope that both GCR electron and proton count rates at the same
average rigidity vary in anticorrelation with the tilt angle of the
heliospheric current sheet, while the amplitude of the variation is
significantly larger in the electron count rate than in the proton count rate.
We show that this observed charge-sign dependence is reproduced by a numerical
``drift model'' of the GCR transport in the heliosphere. This is a clear
signature of the drift effect on the long-term solar modulation observed with a
single detector.

  Computing Technology","13 pages, 4 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.CV physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time-series clustering serves as a powerful data mining technique for
time-series data in the absence of prior knowledge about clusters. A large
amount of time-series data with large size has been acquired and used in
various research fields. Hence, clustering method with low computational cost
is required. Given that a quantum-inspired computing technology, such as a
simulated annealing machine, surpasses conventional computers in terms of fast
and accurately solving combinatorial optimization problems, it holds promise
for accomplishing clustering tasks that are challenging to achieve using
existing methods. This study proposes a novel time-series clustering method
that leverages an annealing machine. The proposed method facilitates an even
classification of time-series data into clusters close to each other while
maintaining robustness against outliers. Moreover, its applicability extends to
time-series images. We compared the proposed method with a standard existing
method for clustering an online distributed dataset. In the existing method,
the distances between each data are calculated based on the Euclidean distance
metric, and the clustering is performed using the k-means++ method. We found
that both methods yielded comparable results. Furthermore, the proposed method
was applied to a flow measurement image dataset containing noticeable noise
with a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 1. Despite a small signal
variation of approximately 2%, the proposed method effectively classified the
data without any overlap among the clusters. In contrast, the clustering
results by the standard existing method and the conditional image sampling
(CIS) method, a specialized technique for flow measurement data, displayed
overlapping clusters. Consequently, the proposed method provides better results
than the other two methods, demonstrating its potential as a superior
clustering method.

literature, spherical CNNs with $\mathsf{SO}(3)$-equivariant layers have been
developed to cope with data that are samples of signals on the sphere $S^2$.
One can implicitly obtain $\mathsf{SO}(3)$-equivariant convolutions on $S^2$
with significant efficiency gains by explicitly requiring gauge equivariance
w.r.t. $\mathsf{SO}(2)$. In this paper, we build on this fact by introducing a
higher order generalization of the gauge equivariant convolution, whose
implementation is dubbed a gauge equivariant Volterra network (GEVNet). This
allows us to model spatially extended nonlinear interactions within a given
receptive field while still maintaining equivariance to global isometries. We
prove theoretical results regarding the equivariance and construction of higher
order gauge equivariant convolutions. Then, we empirically demonstrate the
parameter efficiency of our model, first on computer vision benchmark data
(e.g. spherical MNIST), and then in combination with a convolutional kernel
network (CKN) on neuroimaging data. In the neuroimaging data experiments, the
resulting two-part architecture (CKN + GEVNet) is used to automatically
discriminate between patients with Lewy Body Disease (DLB), Alzheimer's Disease
(AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) from diffusion magnetic resonance images
(dMRI). The GEVNet extracts micro-architectural features within each voxel,
while the CKN extracts macro-architectural features across voxels. This
compound architecture is uniquely poised to exploit the intra- and inter-voxel
information contained in the dMRI data, leading to improved performance over
the classification results obtained from either of the individual components.

network epidemic model, which describes a disease spreading through $n$ nodes,

We propose a family of decentralised adaptive-gain control algorithms, in which
each node has a control gain that adaptively evolves according to a
differential equation, independent of the gains of other nodes. The adaptive
gain is applied multiplicatively to either decrease the infection rate or
increase the recovery rate. To begin, we assume all nodes are controlled, and
prove that both infection rate control and recovery rate control algorithms
eliminate the disease with the limiting gains being positive and finite. Then,
we consider the possibility of controlling a subset of the nodes, for both the
infection rate control and recovery rate control. We first identify a necessary
and sufficient condition for the existence of a subset of nodes, which if
controlled would result in the elimination of the disease. For a given network,
there may exist several such viable subsets, and we propose an iterative
algorithm to identify such a subset. Simulations are provided to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the various proposed controllers.

challenging. Here, we use CEERS NIRCam imaging to investigate the possibility
of galaxy overdensities associated with two very UV-bright LAEs at z=8.7 in the
EGS field. We design a color selection to identify objects at z=8.4-9.1,
selecting 28 candidates (including the one LAE in the footprint, EGSY8p7). We
model the SEDs of these objects and infer that all are moderately faint
($-21.2\lesssim M_{UV}\lesssim-19.1$) with stellar masses of $M_* \approx
10^{7.5 - 8.8}$ $M_\odot$. All are efficient ionizing agents
($\xi_{ion}^*\sim10^{25.5-26.0}$ Hz erg$^{-1}$) and are generally

encompassing both LAEs in the field, which is theoretically unexpected but may
be possible for a galaxy population four times more numerous than the average
to create given moderate escape fractions ($f_{esc}\gtrsim0.15$) over long

retrieval generates identifier strings of passages as the retrieval target. At
a cost, the identifier must be distinctive enough to represent a passage.
Current approaches use either a numeric ID or a text piece (such as a title or
substrings) as the identifier. However, these identifiers cannot cover a
passage's content well. As such, we are motivated to propose a new type of
identifier, synthetic identifiers, that are generated based on the content of a
passage and could integrate contextualized information that text pieces lack.
Furthermore, we simultaneously consider multiview identifiers, including
synthetic identifiers, titles, and substrings. These views of identifiers

Stacking of metalenses as one of the possible solutions increases the overall
complexity of the optical system and hinders the main benefit of reduced
thickness and light weight. To tackle both issues, here we propose a
single-layer imaging system utilizing a recently developed class of metalenses
providing large field of view. Using it, we demonstrate full-color imaging with
a FOV of 100 degrees. This approach, empowered by computational imaging
techniques, produce high quality images, both in terms of color reproduction
and sharpness. Suitable for real-time unpolarized light operation with the
standard color filters present in prevalent camera systems, our results might
enable a pathway for consumer electronics applications of this emerging
technology.

behavior of Mg, and Cu and their effect on the energy and mechanical properties

{\Sigma}9[110](221) GB, and {\Sigma}11[110](332) GB. The results show that both
Mg and Cu have a segregation tendency at the GBs, and the segregation tendency
of Cu is stronger than Mg. Mg is prone to form substitutional segregation at
the GBs, but Cu is more likely to segregate at the interstitial sites. The
segregation of Mg and Cu can reduce GB energy, and the GB energy continues to
decrease with the increase of the segregation concentration. First-principles
calculation tensile test shows that the segregation of Mg has a negative effect
on the strength of GBs, and the GB strength decreases with the increase of the
Mg concentration, while the GB strength was gradually enhanced with the
increase of the Cu concentration. The strength of {\Sigma}5(210) GB and
{\Sigma}9(221) GB are more sensitive to the segregation of solute atoms than
the other two GBs. By calculating the charge density and the density of states
of the pristine and the segregated GBs, it was found that the segregation of Mg
caused charge depletion and structure expansion at the GBs, while the
segregation of Cu increases the charge density of GBs and form new bonds with
the surrounding Al atoms. The results provide useful information for improving
the mechanical properties of materials by using the concept of GB segregation

However, 3D CNNs are highly computationally complex due to their volume and

We start by directly merging multiple datasets and training a single report

trained separately on each specific dataset. We suspect that this is caused by
the dilemma between the diversity of body parts and the limited availability of

consider a diverse range of body parts and medical conditions. However,
collecting a sufficiently large dataset for each specific body part can be
difficult due to various factors, such as data availability and privacy
concerns. Thus, rather than striving for more data, we propose a
single-for-multiple (S4M) framework, which seeks to facilitate the learning of
the report generation model with two auxiliary priors: an explicit prior (\ie,
feeding radiology-informed knowledge) and an implicit prior (\ie, guided by
cross-modal features). Specifically, based on the conventional encoder-decoder
report generation framework, we incorporate two extra branches: a
Radiology-informed Knowledge Aggregation (RadKA) branch and an Implicit Prior
Guidance (IPG) branch. We conduct the experiments on our merged dataset which

  data measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory","Submitted to JCAP",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The combined fit of the measured energy spectrum and shower maximum depth
distributions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is known to constrain the
parameters of astrophysical models with homogeneous source distributions.
Studies of the distribution of the cosmic-ray arrival directions show a better
agreement with models in which a fraction of the flux is non-isotropic and
associated with the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A or with catalogs such as
that of starburst galaxies. Here, we present a novel combination of both
analyses by a simultaneous fit of arrival directions, energy spectrum, and
composition data measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory.
  We find that a model containing a flux contribution from the starburst galaxy
catalog of around 20% at 40 EeV with a magnetic field blurring of around
$20^\circ$ for a rigidity of 10 EV provides a fair simultaneous description of
all three observables. The starburst galaxy model is favored with a
significance of $4.5\sigma$ (considering experimental systematic effects)
compared to a reference model with only homogeneously distributed background
sources. By investigating a scenario with Centaurus A as a single source in
combination with the homogeneous background, we confirm that this region of the
sky provides the dominant contribution to the observed anisotropy signal.
Models containing a catalog of jetted active galactic nuclei whose flux scales
with the $\gamma$-ray emission are, however, disfavored as they cannot
adequately describe the measured arrival directions.

  polarization: The case of monolayer TiOCl$_2$",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.str-el","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exciton binding energy and lifetime are the two most important parameters
controlling exciton dynamics, and the general consensus is that the larger the
former the larger the latter. However our first-principles study of monolayer
ferroelectric TiOCl$_2$ shows that this is not always the case. We find that
ferroelectric polarization tends to weaken exciton binding but enhance exciton
lifetime. This stems from the different effects of the induced built-in
electric field and structural distortion by the spontaneous polarization: the
former always destabilizes or even dissociates the exciton while the latter
leads to a relaxation of the selection rule and activates excitons that are
otherwise not optically active. Their combined effect leads to a halving of the
exciton binding energy but a substantial increase in lifetime by 40 times. Our
results deepen the understanding of the interaction of light with ferroelectric
materials and provide new insights into the use of ferroelectricity to control
exciton dynamics.

  Anomaly Detection","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection is crucial to the advanced identification of product
defects such as incorrect parts, misaligned components, and damages in
industrial manufacturing. Due to the rare observations and unknown types of
defects, anomaly detection is considered to be challenging in machine learning.
To overcome this difficulty, recent approaches utilize the common visual
representations from natural image datasets and distill the relevant features.
However, existing approaches still have the discrepancy between the pre-trained
feature and the target data, or require the input augmentation which should be
carefully designed particularly for the industrial dataset. In this paper, we
introduce ReConPatch, which constructs discriminative features for anomaly
detection by training a linear modulation attached to a pre-trained model.
ReConPatch employs contrastive representation learning to collect and
distribute features in a way that produces a target-oriented and easily
separable representation. To address the absence of labeled pairs for the
contrastive learning, we utilize two similarity measures, pairwise and
contextual similarities, between data representations as a pseudo-label. Unlike
previous work, ReConPatch achieves robust anomaly detection performance without
extensive input augmentation. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art anomaly
detection performance (99.72%) for the widely used and challenging MVTec AD
dataset.

AlN and the PC | TiAlN interfaces are mainly defined by interfacial C-N bonds,
whereas for PC | TiN, the interface formation is also characterized by numerous
C-Ti and (C-O)-Ti bonds. Bond strength calculations combined with the measured

observed in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) and soft-intermediate state
(SIMS) of the outburst. During the HIMS, the characteristic frequency of the
reverberation lags $\nu_0$ (the frequency at which the soft lag turns to zero
in the lag-frequency spectra) increases when the spectrum softens. This
reflects a reduction of the spatial distance between the corona and accretion
disc, when assuming the measured time lags are associated with the light travel
time. We also find a strong correlation between $\nu_0$ and type-C Quasi
Periodic Oscillation (QPO) centroid frequency $\nu_{QPO}$, which can be well
explained by the Lense-Thirring (L-T) precession model under a truncated disk
geometry. Despite the degeneracy in the spectral modellings, our results
suggest that the accretion disc is largely truncated in the low hard state
(LHS), and moves inward as the spectrum softens. Combine the spectral modelling
results with the $\nu_0$ - $\nu_{QPO}$ evolution, we are inclined to believe
that this source probably have a truncated disk geometry in the hard state.

convective boundary. To investigate this quick decrease, we conducted an
asteroseismic study on the intermediate-mass SPB star KIC 10526294. We
generated stellar models with varied input parameters, including the overshoot
parameters, and compared the resulting stellar oscillation periods with
observations. To mitigate the potential issue arising from large steps in the
stellar parameters and stellar age, we employed a comprehensive interpolation
scheme for the stellar oscillatory frequencies, considering all stellar
parameters and stellar age. Our analysis revealed that the quick decreasing of
the diffusion coefficient has discernible effects on the stellar oscillations
and a quick decrease with 4 magnitude orders shows the best oscillatory
frequencies compared with the observations. This provides weak evidence in
support of the prediction made by the turbulent convective mixing model.
Furthermore, we examined the residuals of the oscillation periods and
discovered a potential association between abundance anomalies in the buoyancy
frequency profile and the oscillation-like patterns observed in the residuals.

representations by simultaneously ensuring ranking consistency between two

networks depending on multiple graphs, and extend his results to show that the
continuum limit is also valid in this situation. Specifically, we prove that
the initial value problem (IVP) of the corresponding continuum limit has a
unique solution under general conditions and that the solution becomes the
limit of those to the IVP of the networks in some adequate meaning. Moreover,
we show that if solutions to the networks are stable or asymptotically stable
when the node number is sufficiently large, then so are the corresponding
solutions to the continuum limit, and that if solutions to the continuum limit
are asymptotically stable, then so are the corresponding solutions to the
networks in some weak meaning as the node number tends to infinity. These
results can also be applied to coupled oscillator networks with multiple
frequencies by regarding the frequencies as a weight matrix of another graph.
We illustrate the theory for three variants of the Kuramoto model along with

realize an orbital selective transition to the ordered magnetic state. A
mechanism for such a transition has been proposed recently on the basis of
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations for a two-orbital Hubbard
model. Considering long-range magnetic fluctuations beyond DMFT changes the
orbital selective type of the N\'eel transition to a conventional one that
occurs simultaneously for both orbitals as a consequence of Hund's exchange
coupling of magnetic fluctuations of different orbitals. Here, we show that in
the absence of Hund's coupling a novel mechanism of an orbital selective N\'eel
transition (OSNT) is at work. On the basis of the two-orbital calculations for
a Hubbard model with different bandwidths we show that the proposed OSNT can be
realized for an arbitrary value of the electronic interaction. We demonstrate
that in the weak coupling regime this transition is governed by a Slater
mechanism and thus occurs first for the narrow orbital. At strong coupling a
Heisenberg mechanism of the OSNT is realized, and the transition occurs first
for the wide orbital. Remarkably, at intermediate values of the interaction we
find a non-trivial regime of the OSNT, where the Slater mechanism leads to a
N\'eel transition that occurs first for the wide orbital.

assign a category to a textual unit, for instance a social media post. Many
research questions from the social sciences do, however, not only require the
detection of the emotion of an author of a post but to understand who is
ascribed an emotion in text. This task is tackled by emotion role labeling
which aims at extracting who is described in text to experience an emotion,
why, and towards whom. This could, however, be considered overly sophisticated
if the main question to answer is who feels which emotion. A targeted approach
for such setup is to classify emotion experiencer mentions (aka ""emoters"")
regarding the emotion they presumably perceive. This task is similar to named
entity recognition of person names with the difference that not every mentioned
entity name is an emoter. While, very recently, data with emoter annotations
has been made available, no experiments have yet been performed to detect such
mentions. With this paper, we provide baseline experiments to understand how
challenging the task is. We further evaluate the impact on experiencer-specific
emotion categorization and appraisal detection in a pipeline, when gold
mentions are not available. We show that experiencer detection in text is a
challenging task, with a precision of .82 and a recall of .56 (F1 =.66). These
results motivate future work of jointly modeling emoter spans and

0.35 K, which found that the vortices generated by out-of-plane magnetic fields
have an elliptical shape, reflecting the anisotropic gap structure. The
orientation of the gap minima is found to be aligned with the bulk direction
when the surface lattice image shows twofold symmetry, but, surprisingly, it is
rotated by 30$^{\circ}$ when twofold symmetry is absent. In addition, the
superconducting gap spectra in zero magnetic field suggest that the gap nodes
are most likely lifted. We argue that only an emergent symmetry at the surface,
allowing for a linear superposition of gap functions with different symmetries,
can lead to the rotation of the gap nodes. The absence of inversion symmetry at
the surface additionally lifts the nodes. This result establishes the subtle

the abstract meaning representation (AMR) of the input passages. Incorporating
such information into generation-based models is challenging due to the
heterogeneous nature of the natural language form prevalently used in
generation-based models and the structured form of AMRs. In this work, we study
strategies to incorporate AMR into generation-based EAE models. We propose
AMPERE, which generates AMR-aware prefixes for every layer of the generation

deliver overdispersed distributional forecasts, prompting the combination to be
applied, instead, to the quantile predictions of the distributional forecasts.
Results from different applications are mixed, leaving it as an empirical
question whether to combine probabilities or quantiles. In this paper, we
present an alternative approach. Looking at the distributional forecasts,
combining the probability forecasts can be viewed as vertical combining, with
quantile forecast combining seen as horizontal combining. Our alternative
approach is to allow combining to take place on an angle between the extreme
cases of vertical and horizontal combining. We term this angular combining. The
angle is a parameter that can be optimized using a proper scoring rule. We show
that, as with vertical and horizontal averaging, angular averaging results in a
distribution with mean equal to the average of the means of the distributions
that are being combined. We also show that angular averaging produces a
distribution with lower variance than vertical averaging, and, under certain
assumptions, greater variance than horizontal averaging. We provide empirical
support for angular combining using weekly distributional forecasts of COVID-19

tensile strength of Mg and Cu segregation at three GBs were calculated. The
results show that both Mg and Cu have a large driving force to segregate to Al
GBs, which reduces the GB energy and improves improve GB stability. The
segregation of Mg and Cu on GB-III induces the transformation of the GB
structural unit and the GB structural phase transformations. For the above
three GBs, Cu segregation increases the theoretical tensile strength of GBs to
varying degrees. The segregation of Mg would reduce the resistance of GB-I and

framework for the discrete Perimeter Defense Problem (d-PDP). A team of
defenders is operating on the perimeter to protect the circular territory from
radially incoming intruders. At first, the d-PDP is formulated as a
spatio-temporal multi-task assignment problem (STMTA). The problem of STMTA is
then converted into a multi-label learning problem to obtain labels of segments
that defenders have to visit in order to protect the perimeter. The DSL
framework uses a Multi-Label Classifier using Synaptic Efficacy Function
spiking neuRON (MLC-SEFRON) network for deterministic multi-label learning.
Each defender contains a single MLC-SEFRON network. Each MLC-SEFRON network is
trained independently using input from its own perspective for decentralized
operations. The input spikes to the MLC-SEFRON network can be directly obtained
from the spatio-temporal information of defenders and intruders without any
extra pre-processing step. The output of MLC-SEFRON contains the labels of
segments that a defender has to visit in order to protect the perimeter. Based
on the multi-label output from the MLC-SEFRON a trajectory is generated for a
defender using a Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA) in order to capture
the intruders. The target multi-label output for training MLC-SEFRON is
obtained from an expert policy. Also, the MLC-SEFRON trained for a defender can
be directly used for obtaining labels of segments assigned to another defender
without any retraining. The performance of MLC-SEFRON has been evaluated for
full observation and partial observation scenarios of the defender. The overall
performance of the DSL framework is then compared with expert policy along with
other existing learning algorithms. The scalability of the DSL has been
evaluated using an increasing number of defenders.

  Maps","submitted",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prefix aggregation operation (also called scan), and its particular case,
prefix summation, is an important parallel primitive and enjoys a lot of
attention in the research literature. It is also used in many algorithms as one
of the steps.
  Aggregation over dominated points in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a multidimensional
generalisation of prefix aggregation. It is also intensively researched, both
as a parallel primitive and as a practical problem, encountered in
computational geometry, spatial databases and data warehouses.
  In this paper we show that, for a constant dimension $m$, aggregation over
dominated points in $\mathbb{R}^m$ can be computed by $O(1)$ basic operations
that include sorting the whole dataset, zipping sorted lists of elements,
computing prefix aggregations of lists of elements and flat maps, which expand
the data size from initial $n$ to $n\log^{m-1}n$.
  Thereby we establish that prefix aggregation suffices to express aggregation
over dominated points in more dimensions, even though the latter is a
far-reaching generalisation of the former. Many problems known to be
expressible by aggregation over dominated points become expressible by prefix
aggregation, too.
  We rely on a small set of primitive operations which guarantee an easy
transfer to various distributed architectures and some desired properties of
the implementation.

  Selection","14 pages, 19 figures",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Several blockchain consensus protocols proposed to use of Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs) to solve the limited processing throughput of traditional
single-chain Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains. Many such protocols utilize a
random transaction selection (RTS) strategy (e.g., PHANTOM, GHOSTDAG, SPECTRE,
Inclusive, and Prism) to avoid transaction duplicates across parallel blocks in
DAG and thus maximize the network throughput. However, previous research has
not rigorously examined incentive-oriented greedy behaviors when transaction
selection deviates from the protocol. In this work, we first perform a generic
game-theoretic analysis abstracting several DAG-based blockchain protocols that
use the RTS strategy, and we prove that such a strategy does not constitute a
Nash equilibrium, which is contradictory to the proof in the Inclusive paper.
Next, we develop a blockchain simulator that extends existing open-source tools
to support multiple chains and explore incentive-based deviations from the
protocol. We perform simulations with ten miners to confirm our conclusion from
the game-theoretic analysis. The simulations confirm that greedy actors who do
not follow the RTS strategy can profit more than honest miners and harm the
processing throughput of the protocol because duplicate transactions are
included in more than one block of different chains. We show that this effect
is indirectly proportional to the network propagation delay. Finally, we show
that greedy miners are incentivized to form a shared mining pool to increase
their profits. This undermines the decentralization and degrades the design of
the protocols in question. To further support our claims, we execute more
complex experiments on a realistic Bitcoin-like network with more than 7000

are an instance of obstructing substrate. We show that conventional methods
used to determine the zero-plane displacement can be at odds with proper
outer-layer similarity and may not be applicable for flows at moderate

that recover outer-layer similarity by minimising the difference between the
smooth-wall and canopy diagnostic function everywhere above the roughness
sublayer, not just in the logarithmic layer. We also investigate if the
zero-plane displacement and the friction velocity can be set independently, but
find that outer-layer similarity is more consistently recovered when they are
coupled. Our results suggest a modified outer-layer similarity, where the
K\'arm\'an constant, $\kappa$, is not 0.39, but turbulence is otherwise
smooth-wall-like. When the canopy is dense, the flow above the tips is
essentially smooth-wall-like, with smooth-wall-like $\kappa\approx0.39$ and
origin essentially at the tip plane. For intermediate densities, the overlying
flow perceives a deeper zero-plane displacement, in agreement with previous
studies, but exhibits a lower K\'arm\'an constant, $\kappa\approx0.34-0.36$.
For sparse canopies, $\kappa$ tends back to its smooth-wall value, and the
zero-plane-displacement height is at the canopy bed. For all canopies studied,
the decrease in $\kappa$ never exceeds 15%, which is significantly less than
that obtained in some previous works using conventional methods to assess

attacker can modify the values of up to $q$ samples from a training dataset of

minimization. Compared with simple kernel regression, i.e. the Nadaraya-Watson
estimator, this method can significantly weaken the impact of malicious samples
on the regression performance. We provide the convergence rate as well as the
corresponding minimax lower bound. The result shows that, with proper bandwidth
selection, $\ell_\infty$ error is minimax optimal. The $\ell_2$ error is
optimal if $q\lesssim \sqrt{N/\ln^2 N}$, but is suboptimal with larger $q$. The
reason is that this estimator is vulnerable if there are many attacked samples

method by projecting the initial estimate to the space of Lipschitz functions.
The final estimate is nearly minimax optimal for arbitrary $q$, up to a $\ln N$

enabling technologies for Industry 4.0 and has been deployed in many time- and
mission-critical industrial applications, e.g., automotive and aerospace
systems. Given the stringent real-time communication requirements raised by
these applications, the Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) draws special attention among
the many traffic shapers developed for TSN, due to its ability to achieve
deterministic latency guarantees. Extensive efforts on the designs of
scheduling methods for TAS shapers have been reported in recent years to
improve the system schedulability, each with their own distinct focuses and
concerns. However, these scheduling methods have yet to be thoroughly
evaluated, especially through experimental comparisons, to provide a
systematical understanding on their performance using different evaluation
metrics in various application scenarios. In this paper, we fill this gap by
presenting a comprehensive experimental study on the existing TAS-based
scheduling methods for TSN. We first categorize the system models employed in
these work along with their formulated problems, and outline the fundamental
considerations in the designs of TAS-based scheduling methods. We then perform
extensive evaluation on 16 representative solutions and compare their
performance under both synthetic scenarios and real-life industrial use cases.
Through these experimental studies, we identify the limitations of individual
scheduling methods and highlight several important findings. This work will
provide foundational knowledge for the future studies on TSN real-time
scheduling problems, and serve as the performance benchmarking for scheduling

existing research has reported that the performance of deep models is extremely
sensitive to the configuration of hyperparameters (HPs). However, the selection
of HPs for deep OD models remains a notoriously difficult task due to the lack
of any labels and long list of HPs. In our study. we shed light on an essential

training time itself can cause a serious HP sensitivity issue. Motivated by
this finding, we are dedicated to formulating a strategy to terminate model

pose challenges for conventional detection methods. However, recent studies
demonstrated that iDM coupled to a photon by electric or magnetic dipole
moments can be effectively constrained by intensity frontier experiments using
the displaced single-photon decay signature. In this work, we show that by
utilizing additional signatures for such models, the sensitivity reach can be
increased towards the short-lived regime, $\gamma c\tau \sim O(1)\,$m, which
can occur in the region of the parameter space relevant to successful thermal
freeze-out. These processes are secondary iDM production taking place by
upscattering in front of the decay vessel and electron scattering.
Additionally, we consider dimension-6 scenarios of photon-coupled iDM - the
anapole moment and the charge radius operator - where the leading decay of the
heavier iDM state is $\chi_1 \to \chi_0 e^+ e^-$, resulting in a naturally
long-lived $\chi_1$. We find that the decays of $\chi_1$ at FASER2, MATHUSLA,

signature considered for the elastic coupling case, while secondary production
yields similar constraints as the scattering.

network to compute massive (10-80 M$ _{\odot} $), binary stars at various
initial periods and solar metallicity (Z=0.014), up to the onset of core
collapse. The early Solar System abundances of $^{26}$Al and $^{41}$Ca can be
matched self-consistently by models with initial masses $\geq$25 M$_{\odot}$,
while models with initial primary masses $\geq$35 M$_{\odot}$ can also match
$^{36}$Cl. Almost none of the models provide positive net yields for $^{19}$F,
while for $^{22}$Ne the net yields are positive from 30 M$_{\odot}$ and higher.
This leads to an increase by a factor of approximately 4 in the amount of
$^{22}$Ne produced by a stellar population of binary stars, relative to single
stars. Also, besides the impact on the stellar yields, our 10 M$_{\odot}$
primary star undergoing Case A mass-transfer ends its life as a white dwarf
instead of as a core-collapse supernova. This demonstrates that binary

  Equations","Edited typos",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider a supervised learning setup in which the goal is to predicts an
outcome from a sample of irregularly sampled time series using Neural
Controlled Differential Equations (Kidger, Morrill, et al. 2020). In our
framework, the time series is a discretization of an unobserved continuous
path, and the outcome depends on this path through a controlled differential
equation with unknown vector field. Learning with discrete data thus induces a
discretization bias, which we precisely quantify. Using theoretical results on
the continuity of the flow of controlled differential equations, we show that
the approximation bias is directly related to the approximation error of a
Lipschitz function defining the generative model by a shallow neural network.
By combining these result with recent work linking the Lipschitz constant of
neural networks to their generalization capacities, we upper bound the
generalization gap between the expected loss attained by the empirical risk
minimizer and the expected loss of the true predictor.

Although incentive mechanisms have been devised to foster widespread
participation in MCS, most of them focus only on static tasks (i.e., tasks for

of worker bids. In a dynamic and resource-constrained environment, tasks are
often uncertain (i.e., the platform lacks a priori knowledge about the tasks)

HERALD*, an incentive mechanism that addresses these issues through the use of

achieve noticeable improvements, they cannot often capture rich factual

enhance the pretrained transformer-based models with extra information or

Task-oriented dialogue systems use task schema, which is a set of task
attributes, to encode the user's task goals. Existing studies on USM neglect
explicitly modeling the user's task goals fulfillment using the task schema. In
this paper, we propose SG-USM, a novel schema-guided user satisfaction modeling
framework. It explicitly models the degree to which the user's preferences
regarding the task attributes are fulfilled by the system for predicting the
user's satisfaction level. SG-USM employs a pre-trained language model for
encoding dialogue context and task attributes. Further, it employs a
fulfillment representation layer for learning how many task attributes have
been fulfilled in the dialogue, an importance predictor component for
calculating the importance of task attributes. Finally, it predicts the user
satisfaction based on task attribute fulfillment and task attribute importance.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets (i.e. MWOZ, SGD, ReDial, and JDDC)
show that SG-USM consistently outperforms competitive existing methods. Our
extensive analysis demonstrates that SG-USM can improve the interpretability of
user satisfaction modeling, has good scalability as it can effectively deal

using the former to initialize differentiable marching tetrahedrons (DMTet) and
the latter to model indirect illumination, we can compute the global
illumination via single-bounce differentiable MC ray tracing and jointly
optimize the geometry, material, and light through back propagation.

address this, we propose to explore a seemingly simplified but empirically
useful and scalable task, class-agnostic part segmentation. In this problem, we
disregard the part class labels in training and instead treat all of them as a
single part class. We argue and demonstrate that models trained without part
classes can better localize parts and segment them on objects unseen in
training. We then present two further improvements. First, we propose to make
the model object-aware, leveraging the fact that parts are ""compositions"",
whose extents are bounded by the corresponding objects and whose appearances
are by nature not independent but bundled. Second, we introduce a novel
approach to improve part segmentation on unseen objects, inspired by an
interesting finding -- for unseen objects, the pixel-wise features extracted by
the model often reveal high-quality part segments. To this end, we propose a
novel self-supervised procedure that iterates between pixel clustering and
supervised contrastive learning that pulls pixels closer or pushes them away.
Via extensive experiments on PartImageNet and Pascal-Part, we show notable and

from a list of 148 existing Java QA tools. To carry out a comprehensive study
and evaluate tools in multi-level dimensions, we first mapped the scanning
rules to the CWE and analyze the coverage and granularity of the scanning
rules. Then we conducted an experiment on 5 benchmarks, including 1,425 bugs,
to investigate the effectiveness of these tools. Furthermore, we took
substantial effort to investigate the effectiveness of warnings by comparing
the real labeled bugs with the warnings and investigating their role in bug
detection. Finally, we assessed these tools' time performance on 1,049

developers improve their tools and provide users with suggestions for selecting

networks by augmenting the training data with combinations of random pairs.
Selective mixup is a family of methods that apply mixup to specific pairs, e.g.
only combining examples across classes or domains. These methods have claimed
remarkable improvements on benchmarks with distribution shifts, but their
mechanisms and limitations remain poorly understood.
  We examine an overlooked aspect of selective mixup that explains its success
in a completely new light. We find that the non-random selection of pairs
affects the training distribution and improve generalization by means
completely unrelated to the mixing. For example in binary classification, mixup
across classes implicitly resamples the data for a uniform class distribution -
a classical solution to label shift. We show empirically that this implicit
resampling explains much of the improvements in prior work. Theoretically,
these results rely on a regression toward the mean, an accidental property that
we identify in several datasets.
  We have found a new equivalence between two successful methods: selective
mixup and resampling. We identify limits of the former, confirm the
effectiveness of the latter, and find better combinations of their respective

suggests that NLI models require costly additional machinery to perform
reliably across datasets, e.g., by running inference on a cartesian product of

BEV-IO, a new 3D detection paradigm to enhance BEV representation with instance

(SSR), where the SSR is formulated as a natural language inference (NLI) task.
For each mentioned symptom in a dialogue window, we first generate knowledge
about the symptom and hypothesis about status of the symptom, to form a
(premise, knowledge, hypothesis) triplet. The BERT model is then used to encode
the triplet, which is further processed by modules including utterance
aggregation, self-attention, cross-attention, and GRU to predict the symptom
status. Benefiting from the NLI formalization, the proposed framework can
encode more informative prior knowledge to better localize and track symptom
status, which can effectively improve the performance of symptom status
recognition. Preliminary experiments on Chinese medical dialogue datasets show
that KNSE outperforms previous competitive baselines and has advantages in
cross-disease and cross-symptom scenarios.

zero-shot (ZS-XLT) and few-shot (FS-XLT) cross-lingual transfer setups, where
models fine-tuned on task data in a source language are transferred without any
or with only a few annotated instances to the target language(s). However,
current work typically overestimates model performance as fine-tuned models are
frequently evaluated at model checkpoints that generalize best to validation
instances in the target languages. This effectively violates the main
assumptions of ""true"" ZS-XLT and FS-XLT. Such XLT setups require robust methods
that do not depend on labeled target language data for validation and model
selection. In this work, aiming to improve the robustness of ""true"" ZS-XLT and
FS-XLT, we propose a simple and effective method that averages different
checkpoints (i.e., model snapshots) during task fine-tuning. We conduct
exhaustive ZS-XLT and FS-XLT experiments across higher-level semantic tasks
(NLI, extractive QA) and lower-level token classification tasks (NER, POS). The
results indicate that averaging model checkpoints yields systematic and
consistent performance gains across diverse target languages in all tasks.
Importantly, it simultaneously substantially desensitizes XLT to varying
hyperparameter choices in the absence of target language validation. We also
show that checkpoint averaging benefits performance when further combined with
run averaging (i.e., averaging the parameters of models fine-tuned over
independent runs).

Specifically, we first employ a query-based mask proposal network to generate
masks of all potential objects, where we replace the original class head with
an instance head trained with a binary object loss, thereby enhancing the
class-agnostic mask proposal ability. Then, we introduce a proposal
post-processing approach to adapt the proposals better to the pre-trained VLMs,
avoiding distortion and unnatural proposal inputs. Meanwhile, to facilitate

task when confronted with unwanted distortions (outliers) in field
measurements. Atypical observations present a problem to operational modal
analysis (OMA) algorithms, such as stochastic subspace identification (SSI),
severely biasing parameter estimates and resulting in misidentification of the
system. Despite this predicament, no simple mechanism currently exists capable
of dealing with such anomalies in SSI. Addressing this problem, this paper
first introduces a novel probabilistic formulation of stochastic subspace
identification (Prob-SSI), realised using probabilistic projections.
Mathematically, the equivalence between this model and the classic algorithm is
demonstrated. This fresh perspective, viewing SSI as a problem in probabilistic
inference, lays the necessary mathematical foundation to enable a plethora of
new, more sophisticated OMA approaches. To this end, a statistically robust SSI
algorithm (robust Prob-SSI) is developed, capable of providing a principled and
automatic way of handling outlying or anomalous data in the measured
timeseries, such as may occur in field recordings, e.g. intermittent sensor
dropout. Robust Prob-SSI is shown to outperform conventional SSI when
confronted with 'corrupted' data, exhibiting improved identification
performance and higher levels of confidence in the found poles when viewing
consistency (stabilisation) diagrams. Similar benefits are also demonstrated on
the Z24 Bridge benchmark dataset, highlighting enhanced performance on measured

formation ($T\ll \bar{T}$). This relaxes the $2\sigma$ mismatch between the

Aims: We examine the dust spatial distribution near regions of strong local
heating produced by current sheets, as a step toward exploring a potential path
for chondrule formation. We further aim to investigate current sheet formation
under various conditions in protoplanetary disks in the presence of ambipolar
diffusion and Ohmic resistivity and the effect of current sheet morphology on
dust dynamics in their vicinity. Methods: We use the RAMSES code including
modules for non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics and solution of the dynamics of
multiple sizes of dust grains to compute unstratified shearing box simulations
of current sheet formation. We investigate, through seven models the effect of
the ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic resistivity strength, the initial density,

that current sheets form in all our models, with typical widths of 0.001-0.01
AU and that strong dust fraction variations occur for millimeter-sized grains.
These variations are typically of an order of magnitude and up to two orders of
magnitude for the most favorable cases. We also show that the box size and
resolution has a strong impact on the current sheet distribution and intensity.
Conclusions: The formation of current sheets that can intensely heat their

autonomous driving applications, the calibration accuracy of the camera can
directly affect the accuracy of perception and depth estimation. For online

More existing methods use the sparse direct method to calibrate multi-cameras,
which can ensure both accuracy and real-time performance and is theoretically
achievable. However, this method requires a better initial value, and the
initial estimate with a large error is often stuck in a local optimum. To this

in-silico generation of artificial samples (reproducing the two-scale porosity
of the material) and subsequent finite element modelling of damage, implemented
with phase-field treatment for fracture growth. It is found that small voids
promote damage nucleation and enhance bridging of macro-pores by micro-crack
formation, while macro-pores influence the overall material response and drive
the propagation of large fractures. Our results explain the important role of
multiscale porosity characterizing stiff biological materials and lead to a new

has tremendously intensified in recent years with the direct detection of
gravitational waves (GW) by LIGO/Virgo from BNS merger events which has allowed
the possibility of directly probing the properties of the interior of a neutron
star. A remarkable phenomenon manifested by rapidly rotating neutron stars is
in their {\it avatar} as {\it Pulsars}. The accuracy of pulsar timing can reach
the level of one part in 10$^{15}$, comparable to that of atomic clocks. This
suggests that even a tiny deformation of the pulsar can leave its imprints on
the pulses by inducing tiny perturbations in the entire moment of inertia (MI)
tensor affecting the pulse timings, as well as the pulse profile (from wobbling
induced by off-diagonal MI components). This may allow a new probe of various
phase transitions occurring inside a pulsar core through induced density
fluctuations affecting the MI tensor. Such perturbations also naturally induce
a rapidly changing quadrupole moment of the star, thereby providing a new
source of gravitational wave emission. Another remarkable possibility arises
when we consider the effect of an external GW on neutron star. With the
possibility of detecting any minute changes in its configuration through pulse
observations, the neutron star has the potential of performing as a Weber
detector of gravitational wave. This brief review will focus on these specific
aspects of a pulsar. Specifically, the focus will be on the type of physics
which can be probed by utilizing the effect of changes in the MI tensor of the

  Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving distributed training
scheme, where multiple devices collaborate to train machine learning models by
uploading local model updates. To improve communication efficiency,
over-the-air computation (AirComp) has been applied to FL, which leverages
analog modulation to harness the superposition property of radio waves such
that numerous devices can upload their model updates concurrently for
aggregation. However, the uplink channel noise incurs considerable model
aggregation distortion, which is critically determined by the device scheduling
and compromises the learned model performance. In this paper, we propose a
probabilistic device scheduling framework for over-the-air FL, named PO-FL, to
mitigate the negative impact of channel noise, where each device is scheduled
according to a certain probability and its model update is reweighted using
this probability in aggregation. We prove the unbiasedness of this aggregation
scheme and demonstrate the convergence of PO-FL on both convex and non-convex
loss functions. Our convergence bounds unveil that the device scheduling
affects the learning performance through the communication distortion and
global update variance. Based on the convergence analysis, we further develop a
channel and gradient-importance aware algorithm to optimize the device
scheduling probabilities in PO-FL. Extensive simulation results show that the
proposed PO-FL framework with channel and gradient-importance awareness
achieves faster convergence and produces better models than baseline methods.

MGCAMB case and in the CAMB_GammaPrime_Growth case, but in opposite directions.
This deviation is accompanied by a change in the direction of correlations with

helps reconcile $\gamma_L$ with its $\Lambda$CDM value in both cases.
Conversely, the alternative ground-based telescopes ACT and SPT consistently
yield growth index values in agreement with $\gamma_L=0.55$. We conclude that
the presence of the A$_{\mathrm{lens}}$ problem in the Planck dataset
contributes to the observed deviations, underscoring the importance of

theory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behavior. To do so, we let
different LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) play finitely repeated games with
each other and with other, human-like strategies. Our results show that LLMs
generally perform well in such tasks and also uncover persistent behavioral
signatures. In a large set of two players-two strategies games, we find that
LLMs are particularly good at games where valuing their own self-interest pays
off, like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave
sub-optimally in games that require coordination. We, therefore, further focus
on two games from these distinct families. In the canonical iterated Prisoner's
Dilemma, we find that GPT-4 acts particularly unforgivingly, always defecting
after another agent has defected only once. In the Battle of the Sexes, we find
that GPT-4 cannot match the behavior of the simple convention to alternate
between options. We verify that these behavioral signatures are stable across
robustness checks. Finally, we show how GPT-4's behavior can be modified by
providing further information about the other player as well as by asking it to
predict the other player's actions before making a choice. These results enrich
our understanding of LLM's social behavior and pave the way for a behavioral

  Regression","14 pages, 4 figures, 1 algorithm",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Successful applications of distributional reinforcement learning with
quantile regression prompt a natural question: can we use other statistics to
represent the distribution of returns? In particular, expectile regression is
known to be more efficient than quantile regression for approximating
distributions, especially on extreme values, and by providing a straightforward
estimator of the mean it is a natural candidate for reinforcement learning.
Prior work has answered this question positively in the case of expectiles,
with the major caveat that expensive computations must be performed to ensure
convergence. In this work, we propose a dual expectile-quantile approach which
solves the shortcomings of previous work while leveraging the complementary
properties of expectiles and quantiles. Our method outperforms both
quantile-based and expectile-based baselines on the MuJoCo continuous control
benchmark.

given set, in the form of the Closest String problem: Given a set $X \subseteq
\Sigma^d$ of $n$ strings, find the string $x^*$ minimizing the radius of the
smallest Hamming ball around $x^*$ that encloses all the strings in $X$. In
this paper, we investigate whether the Closest String problem admits algorithms
that are faster than the trivial exhaustive search algorithm. We obtain the
following results for the two natural versions of the problem:
  $\bullet$ In the continuous Closest String problem, the goal is to find the
solution string $x^*$ anywhere in $\Sigma^d$. For binary strings, the
exhaustive search algorithm runs in time $O(2^d poly(nd))$ and we prove that it
cannot be improved to time $O(2^{(1-\epsilon) d} poly(nd))$, for any $\epsilon
> 0$, unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
  $\bullet$ In the discrete Closest String problem, $x^*$ is required to be in
the input set $X$. While this problem is clearly in polynomial time, its
fine-grained complexity has been pinpointed to be quadratic time $n^{2 \pm
o(1)}$ whenever the dimension is $\omega(\log n) < d < n^{o(1)}$. We complement
this known hardness result with new algorithms, proving essentially that
whenever $d$ falls out of this hard range, the discrete Closest String problem
can be solved faster than exhaustive search. In the small-$d$ regime, our
algorithm is based on a novel application of the inclusion-exclusion principle.
  Interestingly, all of our results apply (and some are even stronger) to the
natural dual of the Closest String problem, called the Remotest String problem,
where the task is to find a string maximizing the Hamming distance to all the
strings in $X$.

exact diagonalization results of small antiferromagnetic Heisenberg clusters.
This procedure is also employed to revisit and computationally improve the
previous investigation of the exchange-correlation potential of the half-filled

dimer. Numerical comparisons with exact benchmark calculations for both the
Heisenberg and the Hubbard models indicate that, starting from the
exchange-correlation potential of a finite cluster, the extrapolation procedure
yields a one-particle spectral function with favorable accuracy at a relatively
low computational cost. In addition, a comparison between the ground state

analyses of employee data rises. This increases the relevance of people
analytics (PA), which are tools for the behavioral analysis of employees.
Despite this potential, the successful usage of PA is hindered by employee
concerns. Especially in Europe, where the GDPR or equivalent laws apply,
employee consent is required before data can be processed in PA. Therefore, PA
can only provide relevant insights if employees are willing to share their
data. One potential way of achieving this is the use of appeal strategies. In
the design of PA, the core strategy that can be used is the inclusion of data
owner benefits, such as automated feedback, that are given to employees in
exchange for sharing their own data. In this paper, we examine benefits as an
appeal strategy and develop four design principles for the inclusion of
benefits in PA. Then, we describe an exemplary set of analyses and benefits,
demonstrating how our principles may be put into practice. Based on this
exemplary implementation, we describe and discuss the results of a user study
($n = 46$) among employees in the EU and UK. Our study investigates the factors
that foster or hinder employees' consent to sharing their data with PA. Then,
we introduce our data owner benefits and analyze whether they can positively
influence this consent decision.
  Our introduced data owner benefits were, contrary to our expectations, not
suited to motivate our participants to consent to sharing their data. We
therefore analyze how participants judge the benefits. Participants generally
appreciate having them, confirming the value of including data owner benefits
when designing PA. Some of our introduced benefits negatively influenced
participants' sharing decision, though, meaning that careful consideration of
potential risks is required when conceptualizing them.

strict path-based evaluation metric to further explore few-shot HTC tasks. To
address the issue, we propose the hierarchical verbalizer (""HierVerb""), a
multi-verbalizer framework treating HTC as a single- or multi-label
classification problem at multiple layers and learning vectors as verbalizers
constrained by hierarchical structure and hierarchical contrastive learning. In
this manner, HierVerb fuses label hierarchy knowledge into verbalizers and
remarkably outperforms those who inject hierarchy through graph encoders,
maximizing the benefits of PLMs. Extensive experiments on three popular HTC

significantly boosts the HTC performance, meanwhile indicating an elegant way
to bridge the gap between the large pre-trained model and downstream

models built on PLMs to align with human criteria. However, the models from
different scenarios are optimized individually, which may result in sub-optimal
performance since they neglect the shared knowledge across different scenarios.
Besides, designing individual models for each scenario caused inconvenience to
the user. Inspired by this, we propose Unified Multi-scenario Summarization
Evaluation Model (UMSE). More specifically, we propose a perturbed prefix
tuning method to share cross-scenario knowledge between scenarios and use a
self-supervised training paradigm to optimize the model without extra human
labeling. Our UMSE is the first unified summarization evaluation framework
engaged with the ability to be used in three evaluation scenarios. Experimental
results across three typical scenarios on the benchmark dataset SummEval
indicate that our UMSE can achieve comparable performance with several existing
strong methods which are specifically designed for each scenario.

emergence of an array of new, highly-successful optimizers, perhaps most
importantly the Adam optimizer. It is wiedely used for training neural
networks, yet notoriously hard to interpret. Lacking a clear physical
intuition, Adam is difficult to generalize to manifolds. Some attempts have
been made to directly apply parts of the Adam algorithm to manifolds or to find
an underlying structure, but a full generalization has remained elusive. In
this work a new approach is presented that leverages the special structure of
the manifolds which are relevant for optimization of neural networks, such as
the Stiefel manifold, the symplectic Stiefel manifold, the Grassmann manifold
and the symplectic Grassmann manifold: all of these are homogeneous spaces and
as such admit a global tangent space representation. This global tangent space
representation is used to perform all of the steps in the Adam optimizer. The
resulting algorithm is then applied to train a transformer for which
orthogonality constraints are enforced up to machine precision and we observe
significant speed-ups in the training process. Optimization of neural networks
where they weights do not lie on a manifold is identified as a special case of
the presented framkework. This allows for a flexible implementation in which
the learning rate is adapted simultaneously for all parameters, irrespective of

complex interdependency of numerous physical and digital components, requiring
to take cyber attacks and physical failures equally into account. The online

historical observations of critical but rare events, and the continuous

CyPhERS, a Cyber-Physical Event Reasoning System. CyPhERS provides real-time

However, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is

Accordingly, an intuitive algorithm named DEMIPL, i.e., Disambiguated attention

  We show that any element of a large gauge transformation can be added to the
standard Hamiltonian as a chemical potential without changing field equations
and that in QCD, they lead to confined and deconfined phases . A speculation

be broadly categorized into two groups: those involving CMB-independent probes

include the $H_0$-tension between the value of the present-day expansion rate
of the Universe inferred by CMB observations and local distance ladder
measurements. The latter category involves anomalies between the values of
cosmological parameters obtained by different CMB experiments, as well as their
consistency with the predictions of $\Lambda$CDM. In this chapter, we primarily
focus on this second category and study the agreement among the most recent CMB

privacy, several algorithms have been developed to de-identify imaging data
using blurring, defacing or refacing. Completely removing facial structures
provides the best re-identification protection but can significantly impact
post-processing steps, like brain morphometry. As an alternative, refacing
methods that replace individual facial structures with generic templates have a
lower effect on the geometry and intensity distribution of original scans, and
are able to provide more consistent post-processing results by the price of
higher re-identification risk and computational complexity. In the current
study, we propose a novel method for anonymised face generation for defaced 3D
T1-weighted scans based on a 3D conditional generative adversarial network. To
evaluate the performance of the proposed de-identification tool, a comparative
study was conducted between several existing defacing and refacing tools, with
two different segmentation algorithms (FAST and Morphobox). The aim was to
evaluate (i) impact on brain morphometry reproducibility, (ii)
re-identification risk, (iii) balance between (i) and (ii), and (iv) the

guiding the agent to navigate to an instance of the object category in an

state-of-the-art methods for this problem rely heavily on data-driven
approaches, \eg, end-to-end reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and
others. Moreover, such methods are typically costly to train and difficult to
debug, leading to a lack of transferability and explainability. Inspired by
recent successes in combining classical and learning methods, we present a
modular and training-free solution, which embraces more classic approaches, to
tackle the object goal navigation problem. Our method builds a structured scene
representation based on the classic visual simultaneous localization and
mapping (V-SLAM) framework. We then inject semantics into geometric-based
frontier exploration to reason about promising areas to search for a goal
object. Our structured scene representation comprises a 2D occupancy map,
semantic point cloud, and spatial scene graph.
  Our method propagates semantics on the scene graphs based on language priors
and scene statistics to introduce semantic knowledge to the geometric
frontiers. With injected semantic priors, the agent can reason about the most
promising frontier to explore. The proposed pipeline shows strong experimental
performance for object goal navigation on the Gibson benchmark dataset,
outperforming the previous state-of-the-art. We also perform comprehensive
ablation studies to identify the current bottleneck in the object navigation
task.

improved out-of-domain generalization, and because extensive evidence shows
that fine-tuned models pick up on spurious correlations. Unfortunately,
previous comparisons of the two approaches were done using models of different
sizes. This raises the question of whether the observed weaker out-of-domain
generalization of fine-tuned models is an inherent property of fine-tuning or a
limitation of the experimental setup. In this paper, we compare the
generalization of few-shot fine-tuning and in-context learning to challenge
datasets, while controlling for the models used, the number of examples, and
the number of parameters, ranging from 125M to 30B. Our results show that
fine-tuned language models can in fact generalize well out-of-domain. We find

Understanding the resurgent properties of this asymptotic series, including its

present work addresses this question by setting-up instanton calculus
associated to eigenvalue tunneling (or ZZ-brane contributions), directly in the

both constructed and applied to the present problem. Large-order tests of the

design was to, for a large group of active Twitter users, simultaneously
collect (a) the tweets the personalized algorithm shows, and (b) the tweets the
user would have seen if they were just shown the latest tweets from people they
follow; we then surveyed users about both sets of tweets in a random order.
  Our results indicate that the algorithm amplifies emotional content, and
especially those tweets that express anger and out-group animosity.
Furthermore, political tweets from the algorithm lead readers to perceive their
political in-group more positively and their political out-group more
negatively. Interestingly, while readers generally say they prefer tweets
curated by the algorithm, they are less likely to prefer algorithm-selected
political tweets. Overall, our study provides important insights into the
impact of social media ranking algorithms, with implications for shaping public

Typically, finite alphabet decoding performs concatenated compression
operations on the received channel messages to aggregate compact reliability
information for error correction. These compression operations or mappings can
be considered as lookup tables. For polar codes, the finite alphabet decoder
design boils down to constructing lookup tables for the upper and lower
branches of the building blocks within the code structure. A key challenge is
to realize a hardware-friendly implementation of the lookup tables. This work
uses the min-sum implementation for the upper branch lookup table and, as a
novelty, a computational domain implementation for the lower branch lookup
table. The computational domain approach drastically reduces the number of
implementation parameters. Furthermore, a restriction to uniform quantization
in the lower branch allows a very hardware-friendly compression via clipping
and bit-shifting. Its behavior is close to the optimal non-uniform
quantization, whose implementation would require multiple high-resolution
threshold comparisons. Simulation results confirm excellent performance for the
developed decoder. Unlike conventional fixed-point decoders, the proposed
method involves an offline design that explicitly maximizes the preserved
mutual information under coarse quantization.

The effects of planetesimal fragmentation on planet formation has
been studied by various models on single embryos therefore neglecting
concurrent effects mostly in the outer disk. They show that planetesimal
fragmentation can both hinder or aid planet formation due to the introduction
of competing effects, namely speeding up accretion and depleting the feeding
zone of forming planets. Aims. We investigate the influence of the collisional
fragmentation of planetesimals on the planet formation process using a
population synthesis approach. We aim to investigate its effects for a large
set of initial conditions and also explore the consequences on the formation of
multiple embryos in the same disk. Methods. We run global planet formation
simulations including fragmentation, drift and an improved ice line
description. To do this we use a fragmentation model in our code. The initial
conditions for the simulations that are informed by observations are varied to
generate synthetic exoplanet populations. Results. Our synthetic populations
show that depending on the typical size of solids generated in collisions,
fragmentation in tandem with the radial drift can either enhance or hinder
planet formation. For larger fragments we see increased accretion throughout
the populations especially beyond the ice line. However, the shorter drift
timescale of smaller fragments, due to their stronger coupling to the gas, can
hinder the formation process. Furthermore, beyond the ice line fragmentation
promotes late growth when the damping by gas drag fades Conclusions.
Fragmentation significantly affects the planet formation process in various
ways for all types of planet and warrants further investigation.

proposed to include a local search step in the mutation process based on the
idea that performing a linear regression during the mutation can allow for a
faster convergence to good-quality solutions. While GSM-LS helps the
convergence of the evolutionary search, it is prone to overfitting. Thus, it
was suggested to use GSM-LS only for a limited number of generations and,
subsequently, to switch back to standard geometric semantic mutation. A more
recently defined variant of GSGP (called GSGP-reg) also includes a local search

multiple possibilities to limit the overfitting of GSM-LS and GSGP-reg, ranging
from adaptive methods to estimate the risk of overfitting at each mutation to a
simple regularized regression. The results show that the method used to limit
overfitting is not that important: providing that a technique to control
overfitting is used, it is possible to consistently outperform standard GSGP on

predictions through the lens of the training data. Their utility is assumed to
be in identifying training examples ""responsible"" for a prediction so that, for
example, correcting a prediction is possible by intervening on those examples
(removing or editing them) and retraining the model. However, recent empirical
studies have shown that the existing methods of estimating IF predict the
leave-one-out-and-retrain effect poorly.
  In order to understand the mismatch between the theoretical promise and the
practical results, we analyse five assumptions made by IF methods which are
problematic for modern-scale deep neural networks and which concern convexity,
numeric stability, training trajectory and parameter divergence. This allows us
to clarify what can be expected theoretically from IF. We show that while most
assumptions can be addressed successfully, the parameter divergence poses a
clear limitation on the predictive power of IF: influence fades over training
time even with deterministic training. We illustrate this theoretical result
with BERT and ResNet models.
  Another conclusion from the theoretical analysis is that IF are still useful
for model debugging and correcting even though some of the assumptions made in
prior work do not hold: using natural language processing and computer vision
tasks, we verify that mis-predictions can be successfully corrected by taking
only a few fine-tuning steps on influential examples.

across all accounts, which is stronger than necessary to implement a replicated
ledger. This makes updates slower and more expensive than necessary. More
recent consensus-free replicated ledgers forego consensus algorithms, with
significant increase in performance and decrease in infrastructure costs.
However, current designs are based around reliable broadcast of update
operations to all replicas which require reliable message delivery and
reasoning over operation histories to establish convergence and safety.
  In this paper, we present a replicated ledger as a state-based conflict-free
replicated data type (CRDT) based on grow-only counters. This design provides
two major benefits: 1) it requires a weaker eventual transitive delivery of the
latest state rather than reliable broadcast of all update operations to all
replicas; 2) eventual convergence and safety properties can be proven easily
without having to reason over operation histories: convergence comes from the
composition of grow-only counters, themselves CRDTs, and safety properties can
be expressed over the state of counters, locally and globally. In addition,
applications that tolerate temporary negative balances require no additional
mechanisms and applications that require strictly non-negative balances can be
supported by enforcing sequential updates to the same account across replicas.
  Our design is sufficient when executing on replicas that might crash and
recover, as common in deployments in which all replicas are managed by trusted
entities. It may also provide a good foundation to explore new mechanisms for
tolerating adversarial replicas.

microstrip length intervals. It defines the unit cell geometry by determining
the length of the meanders to ensure that axial ratio remains below 3 dB

better control over scanning rate (the ratio of change of angle of maximum
radiation with frequency) and reduce spurious radiation of harmonics by
ensuring single harmonic operation within the operational band. To guarantee
continuous scanning through broadside direction, open stopband is suppressed
using mitered angles. The antenna is designed on a 0.254-mm substrate making it

atoms needed to simulate the environment has traditionally prohibited the use
of high-level excited-state electronic structure methods. By leveraging
transfer learning, we show how to construct machine-learned models to
accurately predict high-level excitation energies of a chromophore in solution
from only 400 high-level calculations. We show that when the electronic
excitations of the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water are treated
using EOM-CCSD embedded in a DFT description of the solvent, the optical
spectrum is correctly captured and that this improvement arises from correctly
treating the coupling of the electronic transition to electric fields, which
leads to a larger response upon hydrogen bonding between the chromophore and
water.

(traits). The Axelrod model is based on two sociological phenomena: homophily
(a tendency for individuals to form bonds with people similar to themselves)
and social influence (the way how individuals change their behavior due to
social pressure). However, the Axelrod model does not take into account the
fact that cultural attributes may have different significance for a given

the Axelrod model by giving individual features different weights that have a
decisive impact on the possibility of aligning cultural traits between

recognition have popularized the paradigm of using large datasets to pretrain
representations that can be effectively transferred to downstream tasks. In
this work we evaluate how such a paradigm should be done in imitation learning,
where both pretraining and finetuning data are trajectories collected by
experts interacting with an unknown environment. Namely, we consider a setting
where the pretraining corpus consists of multitask demonstrations and the task
for each demonstration is set by an unobserved latent context variable. The
goal is to use the pretraining corpus to learn a low dimensional representation
of the high dimensional (e.g., visual) observation space which can be
transferred to a novel context for finetuning on a limited dataset of
demonstrations. Among a variety of possible pretraining objectives, we argue
that inverse dynamics modeling -- i.e., predicting an action given the
observations appearing before and after it in the demonstration -- is
well-suited to this setting. We provide empirical evidence of this claim
through evaluations on a variety of simulated visuomotor manipulation problems.
While previous work has attempted various theoretical explanations regarding
the benefit of inverse dynamics modeling, we find that these arguments are
insufficient to explain the empirical advantages often observed in our

lengths of particles are restricted to the range of 10 to 100 nm, and
interparticle spacing is constrained to at least three times the particle
characteristic length. The orientation and dimensions of constituent
ellipsoidal particles are varied to tune localized surface phonon resonances
and control the near-field energy density above metasurfaces. Results show that
particle orientation can be used to regulate the relative magnitude of
resonances in the energy density and particle dimensions may be changed to
adjust the frequency of these resonances within the Reststrahlen band.
Metasurfaces constructed from particles with randomized dimensions display
comparatively broadband thermal emission rather than the three distinct
resonances seen in metasurfaces made with ellipsoidal particles of equivalent
dimensions. When the interparticle spacing in a metasurface exceeds about three
times the particle characteristic length, the spectral energy density above the
metasurface is dominated by individual particle self-interaction and can be
approximated as a linear combination of single-particle spectra. When
interparticle spacing is at the lower limit of three times the characteristic
length, however, multiparticle interaction effects increase, and the spectral
energy density above a metasurface deviates from that of single particles. This

Scrambling can, in principle, be fully characterized via the use of

experimentally. In this work, we put forward an alternative toolbox of
measurement protocols to experimentally probe scrambling by accessing
properties of the operator size probability distribution, which tracks the size

protocols require the preparation of separable mixed states together with local

modern development of near-term quantum algorithms, with the use of mixed

probe the probability-generating function of the operator distribution and
discuss the challenges associated with obtaining the moments of the operator

behavior of stellar spindown differs significantly from prior expectations for
late-type stars. We study the 4Gyr-old benchmark open cluster M67 to explore
this behavior further. We combined a Gaia DR3 sample with the Kepler K2
superstamp of Campaign 5 around M67 and created new light curves from aperture
photometry. The light curves are subjected to an extensive correction process
to remove instrumental systematics and trending, followed by period analysis to
measure stellar rotation. We identify periodic signals in 136 light curves, 47

periods of single stars of age 4Gyr define a tight relationship with color,
ranging from spectral types F through M. The corresponding surface of rotation
period against age and mass is therefore well-defined to an older age than was
previously known. However, the deviations from prior expectations of the

be effective in providing provable robustness guarantees. To improve its
scalability, over-approximating the non-linear activation functions in DNNs by
linear constraints has been widely adopted, which transforms the verification
problem into an efficiently solvable linear programming problem. Many efforts
have been dedicated to defining the so-called tightest approximations to reduce
overestimation imposed by over-approximation. In this paper, we study existing
approaches and identify a dominant factor in defining tight approximation,
namely the approximation domain of the activation function. We find out that
tight approximations defined on approximation domains may not be as tight as
the ones on their actual domains, yet existing approaches all rely only on
approximation domains. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
dual-approximation approach to tighten over-approximations, leveraging an

the first images and spectra from JWST, covering a multitude of science cases
and using multiple modes of each on-board instrument. Here, we present
transmission spectroscopy observations of the hot-Saturn WASP-96b with the
Single Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode of the Near Infrared Imager and
Slitless Spectrograph, observed as part of the ERO program. As the SOSS mode
presents some unique data reduction challenges, we provide an in-depth
walk-through of the major steps necessary for the reduction of SOSS data:
including background subtraction, correction of 1/f noise, and treatment of the
trace order overlap. We furthermore offer potential routes to correct for field
star contamination, which can occur due to the SOSS mode's slitless nature. By
comparing our extracted transmission spectrum with grids of atmosphere models,
we find an atmosphere metallicity between 1x and 5x solar, and a solar
carbon-to-oxygen ratio. Moreover, our models indicate that no grey cloud deck
is required to fit WASP-96b's transmission spectrum, but find evidence for a
slope shortward of 0.9$\mu$m, which could either be caused by enhanced Rayleigh
scattering or the red wing of a pressure-broadened Na feature. Our work
demonstrates the unique capabilities of the SOSS mode for exoplanet
transmission spectroscopy and presents a step-by-step reduction guide for this

devices, e.g., with limited memory for the computation. If the required memory
to train a model exceeds this limit, the device will be excluded from the
training. This can lead to a lower accuracy as valuable data and computation
resources are excluded from training, also causing bias and unfairness. The FL
training process should be adjusted to such constraints. The state-of-the-art
techniques propose training subsets of the FL model at constrained devices,
reducing their resource requirements for training. But these techniques largely
limit the co-adaptation among parameters of the model and are highly
inefficient, as we show: it is actually better to train a smaller (less
accurate) model by the system where all the devices can train the model
end-to-end, than applying such techniques. We propose a new method that enables
successive freezing and training of the parameters of the FL model at devices,
reducing the training's resource requirements at the devices, while still
allowing enough co-adaptation between parameters. We show through extensive
experimental evaluation that our technique greatly improves the accuracy of the
trained model (by 52.4 p.p.) compared with the state of the art, efficiently
aggregating the computation capacity available on distributed devices.

teacher) to train a small student model on the same dataset for the same task.
Treating teacher features as knowledge, prevailing methods of knowledge
distillation train student by aligning its features with the teacher's, e.g.,
by minimizing the KL-divergence between their logits or L2 distance between
their intermediate features. While it is natural to believe that better
alignment of student features to the teacher better distills teacher knowledge,
simply forcing this alignment does not directly contribute to the student's
performance, e.g., classification accuracy. In this work, we propose to align
student features with class-mean of teacher features, where class-mean
naturally serves as a strong classifier. To this end, we explore baseline
techniques such as adopting the cosine distance based loss to encourage the
similarity between student features and their corresponding class-means of the
teacher. Moreover, we train the student to produce large-norm features,
inspired by other lines of work (e.g., model pruning and domain adaptation),
which find the large-norm features to be more significant. Finally, we propose
a rather simple loss term (dubbed ND loss) to simultaneously (1) encourage
student to produce large-\emph{norm} features, and (2) align the
\emph{direction} of student features and teacher class-means. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our explored techniques help existing KD
methods achieve better performance, i.e., higher classification accuracy on
ImageNet and CIFAR100 datasets, and higher detection precision on COCO dataset.
Importantly, our proposed ND loss helps the most, leading to the

This bias often originates from the uneven distribution of real-world data and
can propagate through the annotation process. Escalated integration of these
models in our lives calls for methods to mitigate bias without overbearing
annotation costs. While active learning (AL) has shown promise in training
models with a small amount of annotated data, AL's reliance on the model's
behavior for selective sampling can lead to an accumulation of unwanted bias
rather than bias mitigation. However, infusing clustering with AL can overcome
the bias issue of both AL and traditional annotation methods while exploiting
AL's annotation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive

behaviour, we require formal task-level models which accurately capture

multi-robot systems under uncertainty, and discuss how they can be used for
planning, reinforcement learning, model checking, and simulation.
  Recent Findings: Recent work has investigated models which more accurately
capture multi-robot execution by considering different forms of uncertainty,
such as temporal uncertainty and partial observability, and modelling the
effects of robot interactions on action execution. Other strands of work have
presented approaches for reducing the size of multi-robot models to admit more
efficient solution methods. This can be achieved by decoupling the robots under
independence assumptions, or reasoning over higher level macro actions.
  Summary: Existing multi-robot models demonstrate a trade off between
accurately capturing robot dependencies and uncertainty, and being small enough
to tractably solve real world problems. Therefore, future research should
exploit realistic assumptions over multi-robot behaviour to develop smaller
models which retain accurate representations of uncertainty and robot
interactions; and exploit the structure of multi-robot problems, such as
factored state spaces, to develop scalable solution methods.

propose Global & Efficient Counterfactual Explanations (GLOBE-CE), a flexible
framework that tackles the reliability and scalability issues associated with
current state-of-the-art, particularly on higher dimensional datasets and in

  Over-the-Air Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) is an emerging technique to reduce
the computation and communication overload at the PS caused by the orthogonal
transmissions of the model updates in conventional federated learning (FL).
This reduction is achieved at the expense of introducing aggregation error that
can be efficiently suppressed by means of receive beamforming via large
array-antennas. This paper studies OTA-FL in massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems by considering a realistic scenario in which the
edge server, despite its large antenna array, is restricted in the number of
radio frequency (RF)-chains. For this setting, the beamforming for over-the-air
model aggregation needs to be addressed jointly with antenna selection. This
leads to an NP-hard problem due to the combinatorial nature of the
optimization. We tackle this problem via two different approaches. In the first
approach, we use the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) technique to develop a
two-tier algorithm for joint antenna selection and beamforming. The second
approach interprets the antenna selection task as a sparse recovery problem and
develops two iterative joint algorithms based on the Lasso and fast iterative
soft-thresholding methods. Convergence and complexity analysis is presented for
all the schemes. The numerical investigations depict that the algorithms based
on the sparse recovery techniques outperform the PDD-based algorithm, when the
number of RF-chains at the edge server is much smaller than its array size.
However, as the number of RF-chains increases, the PDD approach starts to be
superior. Our simulations further depict that learning performance with all the
antennas being active at the PS can be closely tracked by selecting less than
20% of the antennas at the PS.

due to its ability to provide valuable uncertainty quantification for
decision-making tasks. However, many existing models oversimplify the problem

serial correlation in the error process. This oversight can potentially
diminish the accuracy of the forecasts, rendering these models less effective

innovative training method that incorporates error autocorrelation to enhance
the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting. Our method involves constructing a
mini-batch as a collection of $D$ consecutive time series segments for model
training and explicitly learning a covariance matrix over each mini-batch that
encodes the error correlation among adjacent time steps. The resulting

This approach means that the gripper's tendons, flexure joints and finger pads

urethane flexures and pads. A push-fit systems results in an assembly time of
under 10 minutes. The gripper design is also highly modular and requires only a

permittivity leads to a computationally demanding inverse problem, requiring
further approximation of the system to an invertible model. Black-box
calibration methods, similar to those applied to microwave vector network
analysers, allow the extraction of the permittivity without detailed
electromagnetic modelling of the probe-sample interaction. These methods,
however, are typically designed for stationary setups. In contrast, the
distance between the sample and the probe tip of the s-SNOM is slowly
modulated, which is required for the lock-in detection used to extract the
near-field interaction buried in the far-field background. Here we propose an
improved calibration method that explicitly takes probe tapping into account.
We validate our method for an s-SNOM operating in a mid-infrared spectral range

reaction-diffusion system. Model solutions are spatio-temporally animated
patterns describing flagellar bending waves, connecting beating patterns of
cilia and flagella with chemical patterns from classical reaction-diffusion
systems. Instead of chemical species freely reacting and diffusing in space,
our system describes the tug-of-war reaction-kinetics of molecular motors that
are anchored in the flagellar structure, but the shear deformation that they
generate can diffuse away via the bending elasticity of the flagellum.
Synchronization of the reaction-kinetics in neighbouring elements occurs via a
sliding-control mechanism. We derive from first principles the
reaction-diffusion basis of animated patterns as a direct consequence of the
high internal energy dissipation by the flagellum relative to the external
dissipation by the surrounding fluid. By fitting nonlinear, large-amplitude
solutions of a specific motor cross-bridge reaction-kinetics, we show that
reaction-diffusion successfully accounts for beating patterns of both bull
sperm and Chlamydomonas (wild-type and mbo2-mutant). Our results suggest that
the flagellar beat occurs far from equilibrium, in the strongly nonlinear
regime, and that a unified mechanism may exist for dynein molecular motor
control that is regulated by axonemal sliding, without requiring
curvature-sensing or the fine-tuning of basal compliance, and only weakly
influenced by hydrodynamic dissipation and the cell body boundary condition.
High internal dissipation allows the emergence of base-to-tip autonomous
travelling waves, independently of the external fluid viscosity. This enables
progressive swimming in low viscosity environments, and may be critical for
external fertilizers and aquatic microorganisms.

that is studied in various fields such as engineering, computer science,
economics, and neuroscience. It involves controlling a system with linear
dynamics and imperfect observations, subject to additive noise, with the goal
of minimizing a quadratic cost function for the state and control variables. In
this work, we consider a generalization of the discrete-time, finite-horizon
LQG problem, where the noise distributions are unknown and belong to
Wasserstein ambiguity sets centered at nominal (Gaussian) distributions. The
objective is to minimize a worst-case cost across all distributions in the
ambiguity set, including non-Gaussian distributions. Despite the added
complexity, we prove that a control policy that is linear in the observations
is optimal for this problem, as in the classic LQG problem. We propose a
numerical solution method that efficiently characterizes this optimal control
policy. Our method uses the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to identify the
least-favorable distributions within the Wasserstein ambiguity sets and
computes the controller's optimal policy using Kalman filter estimation under
these distributions.

artificial general intelligence (AGI) need an internal audit function. First,
it explains what internal audit is: a specific team that performs an ongoing
assessment of an organization's risk management practices and reports directly
to the board of directors, while being organizationally independent from senior
management. Next, the paper discusses the main benefits of internal audit for
AGI labs: it can make their risk management practices more effective; ensure
that the board of directors has a more accurate view of the current level of
risk and the effectiveness of the lab's risk management practices; signal that
the lab follows best practices in corporate governance; and serve as a contact
point for whistleblowers. However, AGI labs should be aware of a number of
limitations: internal audit adds friction; there is not much empirical evidence
in support of the above-mentioned benefits; the benefits depend on the people
involved and their ability and willingness to identify ineffective risk
management practices; setting up and maintaining an internal audit team is
costly; and it should only be seen as an additional ""layer of defense"", not a
silver bullet against emerging risks from AI. Finally, the paper provides a
blueprint for how AGI labs could set up an internal audit team and suggests
concrete things the team would do on a day-to-day basis. These suggestions are
based on the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal
Auditing Standards. In light of rapid progress in AI research and development,
AGI labs need to professionalize their risk management practices. Instead of
""reinventing the wheel"", they should follow existing best practices in
corporate governance. This will not be sufficient as they approach AGI, but
they should not skip this obvious first step.

transactions in a short time frame, or continuously, e.g., manufacturers of
high-volume products. Especially for blockchain implementations such as
Ethereum, which require transactions to include so-called nonces (essentially a

this paper, we propose four different approaches for horizontal scaling of
transaction creation in Ethereum. Our experimental evaluation examines the
performance of the different approaches in terms of scalability and latency and
finds two of the four proposed approaches feasible to scale transaction

a substantial amount of time and effort to write and maintain. A unit test

especially functional oracles, is a well-known challenging problem. Recent
studies proposed to leverage neural models to generate test oracles, i.e.,
neural test oracle generation (NTOG), and obtained promising results. However,
after a systematic inspection, we find there are some inappropriate settings in
existing evaluation methods for NTOG. These settings could mislead the
understanding of existing NTOG approaches' performance. We summarize them as 1)
generating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions, 2) evaluating with an
unrealistic metric, and 3) lacking a straightforward baseline. In this paper,
we first investigate the impacts of these settings on evaluating and
understanding the performance of NTOG approaches. We find that 1)
unrealistically generating test prefixes from bug-fixed program versions
inflates the number of bugs found by the state-of-the-art NTOG approach TOGA by
61.8%, 2) FPR (False Positive Rate) is not a realistic evaluation metric and
the Precision of TOGA is only 0.38%, and 3) a straightforward baseline
NoException, which simply expects no exception should be raised, can find 61%
of the bugs found by TOGA with twice the Precision. Furthermore, we introduce
an additional ranking step to existing evaluation methods and propose an
evaluation metric named Found@K to better measure the cost-effectiveness of
NTOG approaches. We propose a novel unsupervised ranking method to instantiate
this ranking step, significantly improving the cost-effectiveness of TOGA.
Eventually, we propose a more realistic evaluation method TEval+ for NTOG and
summarize seven rules of thumb to boost NTOG approaches into their practical
usages.

high flexibility in the elements arrangement, easy access to the optical paths,
straightforward integration with external optical subsystems - light sources

built around an adapted commercial microscope body or as a home-built setup,
based on standard optomechanical elements, and neither solution delivers the

geometry of latent spaces and the correspondence to human representations.
G\""ardenfors' conceptual spaces is a prominent framework for understanding
human representations. Convexity of object regions in conceptual spaces is
argued to promote generalizability, few-shot learning, and intersubject
alignment. Based on these insights, we investigate the notion of convexity of
concept regions in machine-learned latent spaces. We develop a set of tools for
measuring convexity in sampled data and evaluate emergent convexity in layered
representations of state-of-the-art deep networks. We show that convexity is
robust to basic re-parametrization, hence, meaningful as a quality of
machine-learned latent spaces. We find that approximate convexity is pervasive
in neural representations in multiple application domains, including models of
images, audio, human activity, text, and brain data. We measure convexity
separately for labels (i.e., targets for fine-tuning) and other concepts.
Generally, we observe that fine-tuning increases the convexity of label
regions, while for more general concepts, it depends on the alignment of the
concept with the fine-tuning objective. We find evidence that pre-training
convexity of class label regions predicts subsequent fine-tuning performance.

way insects occupy habitats. Some species may utilise anthropogenic
microhabitat features for their existence, either because they prefer them to
natural features, or because of no choice. Other species are dependent on
natural microhabitats. Identifying and analysing these insects' use of natural
and anthropogenic microhabitats is important to assess their responses to a
changing environment, for improving pollination and managing invasive pests.
Traditional studies of insect microhabitat use can now be supplemented by
machine learning-based insect image analysis. Typically, research has focused
on automatic insect classification, but valuable data in image backgrounds has
been ignored. In this research, we analysed the image backgrounds available on
the ALA database to determine their microhabitats. We analysed the
microhabitats of three insect species common across Australia: Drone flies,
European honeybees and European wasps. Image backgrounds were classified as
natural or anthropogenic microhabitats using computer vision and machine
learning tools benchmarked against a manual classification algorithm. We found
flies and honeybees in natural microhabitats, confirming their need for natural
havens within cities. Wasps were commonly seen in anthropogenic microhabitats.
Results show these insects are well adapted to survive in cities. Management of
this invasive pest requires a thoughtful reduction of their access to
human-provided resources. The assessment of insect image backgrounds is
instructive to document the use of microhabitats by insects. The method offers
insight that is increasingly vital for biodiversity management as urbanisation
continues to encroach on natural ecosystems and we must consciously provide
resources within built environments to maintain insect biodiversity and manage
invasive pests.

  groups and individual pedestrians","25 pages, 15 figures, 3 tables","Sci Rep 13, 5756 (2023)","10.1038/s41598-023-32883-z",,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pedestrian groups are commonly found in crowds but research on their social
aspects is comparatively lacking. To fill that void in literature, we study the
dynamics of collision avoidance between pedestrian groups (in particular dyads)
and individual pedestrians in an ecological environment, focusing in particular
on (i) how such avoidance depends on the group's social relation (e.g.
colleagues, couples, friends or families) and (ii) its intensity of social
interaction (indicated by conversation, gaze exchange, gestures etc). By
analyzing relative collision avoidance in the ``center of mass'' frame, we were
able to quantify how much groups and individuals avoid each other with respect
to the aforementioned properties of the group. A mathematical representation
using a potential energy function is proposed to model avoidance and it is
shown to provide a fair approximation to the empirical observations. We also
studied the probability that the individuals disrupt the group by ``passing
through it'' (termed as intrusion). We analyzed the dependence of the
parameters of the avoidance model and of the probability of intrusion on
groups' social relation and intensity of interaction. We confirmed that the
stronger social bonding or interaction intensity is, the more prominent
collision avoidance turns out. We also confirmed that the probability of
intrusion is a decreasing function of interaction intensity and strength of
social bonding. Our results suggest that such variability should be accounted
for in models and crowd management in general. Namely, public spaces with
strongly bonded groups (e.g. a family-oriented amusement park) may require a
different approach compared to public spaces with loosely bonded groups (e.g. a
business-oriented trade fair).

However, the safe clinical application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP)

with three pores-per-inch (PPI) ratings in clinical plasma applications. Al
foams can filter sparks to avoid damage from high voltage discharge during
surgery and efficiently deliver reactive species generated in CAP to the
target. The sparks appear and plasma intensity increases at the foam/discharge
interface, which just slightly increases the interface temperature without
changing the interface microstructure during a 30-minute treatment. After CAP
penetrated the Al foams, N2, N2+, *OH, O, and He emission peaks were
characterized, and the highest values appeared using Al foams with 10 PPI. CAP
with and without Al foam intermediating was used to treat deionized water, and
the results indicate CAP in combination with 10 PPI Al foam led to much higher
ROS concentration than CAP alone. For melanoma cell experiments, CAP with and
without Al foam had a similar effect on cell viability after 30-second
treatment, while CAP with the 10-PPI Al foam had much higher killing efficiency
than CAP alone after 60-second treatment. In summary, 10-PPI Al foam can not
only prevent damage to tissues resulting from high discharge voltage during
clinical surgery but also increase the delivery efficiency of reactive species
generated in plasma for biomedical applications.

models by providing complementary information. However, the use of multi-view

challenges for the prediction models that can lead to poor generalization.
Therefore, relevant feature selection from multi-view datasets is important as
it not only addresses the poor generalization but also enhances the
interpretability of the models. Despite the success of traditional feature
selection methods, they have limitations in leveraging intrinsic information
across modalities, lacking generalizability, and being tailored to specific

these limitations of traditional feature selection methods for multi-view data.
Our proposed approach, called the multi-view multi-objective feature selection

framework demonstrates superior performance and interpretability for feature
selection on multi-view datasets in both binary and multiclass classification

synthetic and real data, show improvement over the best baseline methods. This
work provides a promising solution for multi-view feature selection and opens

optimized by Backpropagation, on the same training objective of

$c_{\sigma,\rho}$ is a constant with an intricate dependency on $\sigma$ and
$\rho$. Despite this intricacy, we show that the algorithms in the accompanying
paper are most likely optimal, i.e., for any pair $(\sigma, \rho)$ of finite or
cofinite sets where the problem is non-trivial, and any $\varepsilon>0$, a
$(c_{\sigma,\rho}-\varepsilon)^{\text{tw}}\cdot n^{O(1)}$-algorithm counting
the number of $(\sigma,\rho)$-sets would violate the Counting Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis ($\#$SETH). For finite sets $\sigma$ and $\rho$,
our lower bounds also extend to the decision version, showing that those
algorithms are optimal in this setting as well.

  AI Chatbots","Preprint submitted to IoTCPS Elsevier (2023)",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  ChatGPT, an AI-based chatbot, was released to provide coherent and useful
replies based on analysis of large volumes of data. In this article, leading
scientists, researchers and engineers discuss the transformative effects of
ChatGPT on modern education. This research seeks to improve our knowledge of
ChatGPT capabilities and its use in the education sector, identifying potential
concerns and challenges. Our preliminary evaluation concludes that ChatGPT
performed differently in each subject area including finance, coding and maths.
While ChatGPT has the ability to help educators by creating instructional
content, offering suggestions and acting as an online educator to learners by
answering questions and promoting group work, there are clear drawbacks in its
use, such as the possibility of producing inaccurate or false data and
circumventing duplicate content (plagiarism) detectors where originality is
essential. The often reported hallucinations within Generative AI in general,
and also relevant for ChatGPT, can render its use of limited benefit where
accuracy is essential. What ChatGPT lacks is a stochastic measure to help
provide sincere and sensitive communication with its users. Academic
regulations and evaluation practices used in educational institutions need to
be updated, should ChatGPT be used as a tool in education. To address the
transformative effects of ChatGPT on the learning environment, educating
teachers and students alike about its capabilities and limitations will be
crucial.

event. Real-time detection of extreme events such as wildfires, cyclones, or
floods using satellite data has become crucial for disaster management.
Although several earth-observing satellites provide information about
disasters, satellites in the geostationary orbit provide data at intervals as
frequent as every minute, effectively creating a video from space. There are
many techniques that have been proposed to identify anomalies in surveillance
videos; however, the available datasets do not have dynamic behavior, so we
discuss an anomaly framework that can work on very high-frequency datasets to
find very fast-moving anomalies. In this work, we present a diffusion model
which does not need any motion component to capture the fast-moving anomalies
and outperforms the other baseline methods.

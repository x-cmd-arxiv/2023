multi-source remote estimation, where a scheduler determines when to take
samples from multiple continuous-time Gauss-Markov processes and send the
samples over multiple channels to remote estimators. The sample transmission
times are i.i.d. across samples and channels. The objective of the scheduler is
to minimize the weighted sum of the time-average expected estimation errors of
these Gauss-Markov sources. This problem is a continuous-time Restless
Multi-arm Bandit (RMAB) problem with a continuous state space. We prove that
the arms are indexable and derive an exact expression of the Whittle index. To
the extent of our knowledge, this is the first Whittle index policy for
multi-source signal-aware remote estimation. This result has two degenerated
cases of interest: (i) In the single-source case, the Whittle index policy
reproduces earlier threshold-based sampling policies for the remote estimation
of Wiener and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. When the instantaneous estimation
error of the Gauss-Markov process crosses the optimal threshold, the Whittle
index is precisely equal to 0. In addition, a new optimal sampling policy for
the remote estimation of the unstable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is obtained.
(ii) In the signal-agnostic case, we find an exact expression of the Whittle
index for Age of Information (AoI)-based remote estimation, which complements
earlier results by allowing for random transmission times. Our numerical
results show that the proposed policy performs better than the signal-agnostic
AoI-based Whittle index policy and the Maximum-Age-First, Zero-Wait (MAF-ZW)
policy. The performance gain of the proposed policy is high when some of the
Gauss-Markov processes are highly unstable or when the sample transmission
times follow a heavy-tail distribution.

intelligence, making a profound impact on society and various industries like
business and science. However, the presence of false information on the
internet and in text corpus poses a significant risk to the reliability and
safety of LLMs, underscoring the urgent need to understand the mechanisms of
how false information influences the behaviors of LLMs. In this paper, we dive
into this problem and investigate how false information spreads in LLMs and
affects related responses. Specifically, in our series of experiments, we
investigate different factors that can influence the spread of information in
LLMs by comparing three degrees of information relevance (direct, indirect, and
peripheral), four information source styles (Twitter, web blogs, news reports,
and research papers) and two common knowledge injection paradigms (in-context
injection and learning-based injection). The experimental results show that
(1)False information will spread and contaminate related memories in LLMs via a
semantic diffusion process, i.e., false information has global detrimental
effects beyond its direct impact. (2)Current LLMs are susceptible to authority
bias, i.e., LLMs are more likely to follow false information presented in
trustworthy styles such as news reports and research papers, which usually
cause deeper and wider pollution of information. (3)Current LLMs are more
sensitive to false information through in-context injection than through
learning-based injection, which severely challenges the reliability and safety
of LLMs even when all training data are trusty and correct. The above findings
raise the need for new false information defense algorithms to address the
global impact of false information, and new alignment algorithms to unbiasedly
lead LLMs to follow essential human values rather than superficial patterns.

acoustic model with integrated pitch and duration predictors for
phoneme-to-Mel-spectrogram prediction. The accented front-end directly models
the phonetic variation, while the accented acoustic model explicitly controls
the prosodic variation. Specifically, both models are first pre-trained on a
large amount of data, then only the accent-related layers are fine-tuned on a
limited amount of data for the target accent. In the experiments, speech data
of three English accents, i.e., General American English, Irish English, and
British English Received Pronunciation, are used for pre-training. The
pre-trained models are then fine-tuned with Scottish and General Australian
English accents, respectively. Both objective and subjective evaluation results
show that the accented TTS front-end fine-tuned with a small accented phonetic
lexicon (5k words) effectively handles the phonetic variation of accents, while
the accented TTS acoustic model fine-tuned with a limited amount of accented

that does not necessarily require quadrature exactness assumptions. Instead of
certain exactness degrees, we employ a restricted isometry relation based on
the Marcinkiewicz--Zygmund system of quadrature rules to quantify the
quadrature error of polynomial integrands. The new method imposes only some
conditions on the polynomial degree of numerical solutions to derive the
maximum principle and energy stability, and thus, differs substantially from
existing methods in the literature that often rely on strict conditions on the
time stepping size, Lipschitz property of the nonlinear term, or $L^{\infty}$
boundedness of numerical solutions. Moreover, the new method is suitable for
long-time simulations because the time stepping size is independent of the
diffusion coefficient in the equation. Inspired by the effective maximum
principle recently proposed by Li (Ann. Appl. Math., 37(2): 131--290, 2021), we
develop an almost sharp maximum principle that allows controllable deviation of
numerical solutions from the sharp bound. Further, we show that the new method
is energy stable and equivalent to the Galerkin method if the quadrature rule
exhibits sufficient exactness degrees. In addition, we propose an energy-stable
mixed-quadrature scheme which works well even with randomly sampled initial
condition data. We validate the theoretical results about the energy stability

learning--the prevailing few-shot paradigm based on large language
models--exhibits compositional generalization. In this paper, we present CoFe,
a test suite to investigate in-context compositional generalization. We find
that the compositional generalization performance can be easily affected by the
selection of in-context examples, thus raising the research question what the
key factors are to make good in-context examples for compositional
generalization. We study three potential factors: similarity, diversity and
complexity. Our systematic experiments indicate that in-context examples should
be structurally similar to the test case, diverse from each other, and
individually simple. Furthermore, two strong limitations are observed:
in-context compositional generalization on fictional words is much weaker than
that on commonly used ones; it is still critical that the in-context examples
should cover required linguistic structures, even though the backbone model has
been pre-trained on large corpus. We hope our analysis would facilitate the

  We take inspiration from behavioural types with a key difference: peers
communicate through an event notification mechanism rather than through

local-first software where network devices collaborate on a common task while
retaining full autonomy: every participating device can locally make progress
at all times, not encumbered by unavailability of other devices or network

emerge during computations. Our main result shows that under suitable
well-formedness conditions for swarm protocols consistency is eventually
recovered and the locally observable behaviour of conforming machines will
eventually match the global specification.

  Networks and the Mergegram Invariant","44 pages",,,,"math.AT q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In real world, mutations of genetic sequences are often accompanied by their
recombinations. Such joint phenomena are modeled by phylogenetic networks.
Nakkleh formulated the phylogenetic network reconstruction problem (PNRP) as
follows: Given a family of phylogenetic trees over a common set of taxa, is
there a unique minimal phylogenetic network whose set of spanning trees
contains the family? There are different answers to PNRP, since there are
different ways to define what a minimal network is (based on different
optimization criteria). Inspired by ideas from topological data analysis (TDA),
we devise lattice-diagram models for the visualization of phylogenetic networks
and of filtrations, called the cliquegram and the facegram, respectively, both
generalizing the dendrogram model of phylogenetic trees. Both models allow us
to solve the PNRP in a rigorous way and free of choosing optimization criteria.
The solution to the phylogenetic network and filtration reconstruction process
is obtained by taking the join operation of the dendrograms on the lattice of
cliquegrams, and of facegrams, respectively. Furthermore, we show that
computing the join-facegram from a given set of dendrograms is polynomial in
the size and number of the input trees. We propose two novel invariants of
facegrams, (i) the face-Reeb graph and (ii) the mergegram of a facegram. We
show the mergegram is 1-Lipschitz stable, while the face-Reeb graph is not. In
particular, we show that the mergegram is invariant of weak equivalences of
filtrations (a stronger form of homotopy equivalence). This new TDA-signature,
the mergegram, can be used as a computable proxy for phylogenetic networks and
also, more broadly, for filtrations of datasets, which might be of independent
interest to TDA. To illustrate the utility of those new TDA-tools to
phylogenetics, we provide experiments with artificial and benchmark biological
data.

M5-brane action in the Sen formalism of self-dual form. Although in this
formalism the gravity couples to the independent pseudo-$2$-form and
pseudo-$3$-form fields in a non-standard and very complicated way, the double
dimensional reduction on the complete action can be carried out. This is by
dualising some components of the pseudo-$2$-form field and integrating out the
pseudo-$3$-form field. We show explicitly that the double dimensional reduction
on a circle gives rise to the complete D4-brane or the complete dual D4-brane
action depending on what components of the pseudo-$2$-form field are dualised.
The duality between the D4-brane and dual D4-brane actions are realised in the
viewpoint of the Sen formalism as the swapping of the roles of the components
of the pseudo-$2$-form field between those which are dualised and those which
remain. We also make a brief outline on how to generalise this to the cases of
dimensional reduction on some other spaces as well as how to understand the
duality of reduced action from the viewpoint of the Sen formalism. An explicit
example for dimensional reduction of the quadratic six-dimensional action on a
torus is given and the realisation of its S-duality is also discussed.

Current deep learning based methods for sign language understanding (SLU) are

pre-trainable SignBERT+ framework with model-aware hand prior incorporated. In
our framework, the hand pose is regarded as a visual token, which is derived
from an off-the-shelf detector. Each visual token is embedded with gesture
state and spatial-temporal position encoding. To take full advantage of current
sign data resource, we first perform self-supervised learning to model its
statistics. To this end, we design multi-level masked modeling strategies
(joint, frame and clip) to mimic common failure detection cases. Jointly with
these masked modeling strategies, we incorporate model-aware hand prior to
better capture hierarchical context over the sequence. After the pre-training,
we carefully design simple yet effective prediction heads for downstream tasks.
To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we perform extensive
experiments on three main SLU tasks, involving isolated and continuous sign
language recognition (SLR), and sign language translation (SLT). Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance with a notable gain.

reverses the procedure in loc. cit. that generalizes the polytope construction

  In a closely related setting, we consider cases where $Y$ is a projective
variety whose universal torsor $\text{UT}_Y$ is a partial minimal model of a
scheme with a cluster structure of type $\mathcal A$. If the theta functions
parametrized by the integral points of the associated superpotential cone form
a basis of the ring of algebraic functions on $\text{UT}_Y$ and the action of
the torus $T_{\text{Pic}(Y)^*}$ on $\text{UT}_Y$ is compatible with the cluster

to every line bundle on $Y$. We prove that any such Newton--Okounkov body is a
positive set and that $Y$ is a minimal model of a quotient of a cluster
$\mathcal A$-variety by the action of a torus.
  Our constructions lead to the notion of the intrinsic Newton--Okounkov body
associated to a boundary divisor in a partial minimal model of a scheme with a

subroutines in quantum computing. In the basic scenario, one is given black-box
access to a unitary $U$, and an eigenstate $\lvert \psi \rangle$ of $U$ with
unknown eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$, and the task is to estimate the eigenphase
$\theta$ within $\pm\delta$, with high probability. The cost of an algorithm
for us will be the number of applications of $U$ and $U^{-1}$.
  We tightly characterize the cost of several variants of phase estimation
where we are no longer given an arbitrary eigenstate, but are required to
estimate the maximum eigenphase of $U$, aided by advice in the form of states
(or a unitary preparing those states) which are promised to have at least a
certain overlap $\gamma$ with the top eigenspace.
  We give algorithms and matching lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors) for
all ranges of parameters.
  We show that a small number of copies of the advice state (or of an
advice-preparing unitary) are not significantly better than having no advice at
all. We also show that having lots of advice (applications of the
advice-preparing unitary) does not significantly reduce cost, and neither does
knowledge of the eigenbasis of $U$. As an immediate consequence we obtain a
lower bound on the complexity of the Unitary recurrence time problem, matching
an upper bound of She and Yuen~[ITCS'23] and resolving one of their open
questions.
  Lastly, we show that a phase-estimation algorithm with precision $\delta$ and
error probability $\epsilon$ has cost
$\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, matching an easy
upper bound. This contrasts with some other scenarios in quantum computing
(e.g., search) where error-reduction costs only a factor
$O(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$. Our lower bound technique uses a variant of the
polynomial method with trigonometric polynomials.

the star, and in concentration around ~45 degrees to the equatorial plane. As
well, the planet might have lost back some of the accreted mass just before

launched jets during the main outburst of the event. The jets form a bipolar

orbits the bright ($K$ = 7.97 mag), nearby ($d$ = 22 pc), and early-type (M2.5
V) M-dwarf star GJ 1018 with an orbital period of 7.4 days. We used Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods to model 57 precise radial velocity measurements
acquired by the ESPRESSO spectrograph together with TESS photometry and
complementary HARPS data. We find TOI-244 b to be a super-Earth with a radius
of $R_{\rm p}$ = 1.52 $\pm$ 0.12 $\rm R_{\oplus}$ and a mass of $M_{\rm p}$ =
2.68 $\pm$ 0.30 $\rm M_{\oplus}$. These values correspond to a density of
$\rho$ = 4.2 $\pm$ 1.1 $\rm g \cdot cm^{-3}$, which is below what would be
expected for an Earth-like composition. We find that atmospheric loss processes
may have been efficient to remove a potential primordial hydrogen envelope, but
high mean molecular weight volatiles such as water could have been retained.
Our internal structure modeling suggests that TOI-244 b has a
$479^{+128}_{-96}$ km thick hydrosphere over a 1.17 $\pm$ 0.09 $\rm R_{\oplus}$
solid structure composed of a Fe-rich core and a silicate-dominated mantle
compatible with that of the Earth. On a population level, we find two tentative
trends in the density-metallicity and density-insolation parameter space for
the low-density super-Earths, which may hint at their composition. With a 8$\%$
precision in radius and 12$\%$ precision in mass, TOI-244 b is among the most
precisely characterized super-Earths, which, together with the likely presence
of an extended hydrosphere, makes it a key target for atmospheric observations.

Subsequently, we utilize these mixed models to generate images exhibiting
varying degrees of artness with pseudo-annotations. Each photorealistic image
has a corresponding artistic counterpart and a series of interpolated images

The lengthy compilation process is a key bottleneck in this workflow,

paper, we aim to overcome this bottleneck by proposing a comprehensive
pre-compilation technique that tries to minimize the time spent for compiling

The following concepts underpin the proposed approach: Beginning with a problem

applied to encode a representative problem instance into a general-purpose
quantum circuit for that problem class. Once the real problem instance is
known, the previously constructed circuit only needs to be adjusted-with
(nearly) no compilation necessary. Experimental evaluations on QAOA for the

logarithmically with temperature. During supercooled 1stOPTs the equation of
state of the universe undergoes a rapid and drastic change, transitioning from
vacuum-domination to radiation-domination. The statistical variations in bubble
nucleation histories imply that distinct causal patches percolate at slightly
different times. Patches which percolate the latest undergo the longest
vacuum-domination stage and as a consequence develop large over-densities
triggering their collapse into primordial black holes (PBHs). We derive an
analytical approximation for the probability of a patch to collapse into a PBH
as a function of the 1stOPT duration, $\beta^{-1}$, and deduce the expected PBH
abundance. We find that 1stOPTs which take more than $12\%$ of a Hubble time to
complete ($\beta/H \lesssim 8$) produce observable PBHs. Their abundance is
independent of the duration of the supercooling phase, in agreement with the de

develop a novel approach to classifying galaxies by their formation activity in
a way that highlights the green valley population, by modeling the specific
star-formation rate distributions as a function of redshift and deriving the
probability that a galaxy is quiescent (PQ). Using PQ and our flexible
star-formation histories we outline the evolutionary paths of our galaxies in
relation to stellar mass, Sersic index, $R_{eff}$, and stellar mass surface
density. We find that galaxies show no appreciable stellar mass growth after
entering the green valley (a net decrease of 4$\%$) while their stellar mass
surface densities increase by $\sim$ 0.25 dex. Therefore galaxies are becoming
compact during the green valley and this is due to increases in Sersic index

processors via quantum random circuit sampling are based on evaluating the
linear cross-entropy benchmark (XEB). A key question in the theory of XEB is
whether it approximates the fidelity of the quantum state preparation. Previous
works have shown that the XEB generically approximates the fidelity in a regime
where the noise rate per qudit $\varepsilon$ satisfies $\varepsilon N \ll 1$
for a system of $N$ qudits and that this approximation breaks down at large
noise rates. Here, we show that the breakdown of XEB as a fidelity proxy occurs
as a sharp phase transition at a critical value of $\varepsilon N$ that depends
on the circuit architecture and properties of the two-qubit gates, including in
particular their entangling power. We study the phase transition using a
mapping of average two-copy quantities to statistical mechanics models in
random quantum circuit architectures with full or one-dimensional connectivity.
We explain the phase transition behavior in terms of spectral properties of the
transfer matrix of the statistical mechanics model and identify two-qubit gate
sets that exhibit the largest noise robustness.

it is thus a considerable challenge to efficiently learn properties of an
ideal, noise free state $\rho_{id}$. We consider error mitigation techniques,
such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC), Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE)
and Symmetry Verification (SV) which have been developed for mitigating errors
in single expected value measurements and generalise them for mitigating errors
in classical shadows. We find that PEC is the most natural candidate and thus
develop a thorough theoretical framework for PEC shadows with the following
rigorous theoretical guarantees: PEC shadows are an unbiased estimator for the
ideal quantum state $\rho_{id}$; the sample complexity for simultaneously
predicting many linear properties of $\rho_{id}$ is identical to that of the
conventional shadows approach up to a multiplicative factor which is the sample
overhead due to error mitigation. Due to efficient post-processing of shadows,
this overhead does not depend directly on the number of qubits but rather grows
exponentially with the number of noisy gates. The broad set of tools introduced
in this work may be instrumental in exploiting near-term and early

$10^4\lesssim M_h[{\rm M}_\odot]\lesssim 10^8)$ that could dominate
recombinations, in a computational volume that is large enough to sample the
abundance of such halos. The numerical resolution is sufficient (gas particle
mass $\sim 20{\rm M}_\odot$, spatial resolution $< 0.1\;{\rm ckpc}$) to allow
accurate modelling of the hydrodynamic response of gas to photo-heating. We
quantify the photo-evaporation time of minihalos as a function of $M_h$ and its
dependence on the photo-ionization rate, $\Gamma_{-12}$, and the redshift of
reionization, $z_i$. The recombination rate can be enhanced over that of a
uniform medium by a factor $\sim 10-20$ early on. The peak value increases with
$\Gamma_{-12}$ and decreases with $z_i$, due to the enhanced contribution from
minihalos. The clumping factor, $c_r$, decreases to a factor of a few at $\sim
100\;{\rm Myr}$ after the passage of the I-front when the minihalos have been
photo-evaporated; this asymptotic value depends only weakly on $\Gamma_{-12}$.
Recombinations increase the required number of photons per baryon to reionize
the Universe by 20-100 per cent, with the higher value occurring when
$\Gamma_{-12}$ is high and $z_i$ is low. We complement the numerical
simulations with simple analytical models for the evaporation rate and the

the solution map of the PDE between corresponding Sobolev spaces. The proof is
articulated around Sobolev norm error estimates for kernel interpolants and

demonstrate dimension-benign convergence rates if the solution space of the PDE

high-dimensional nonlinear elliptic PDEs and parametric PDEs. Although some
recent machine learning methods have been presented as breaking the curse of

blood analogue past a confined microfluidic cylinder. The objective of this
work is to characterize the onset of said lateral asymmetry by investigating
the flow of two non-Newtonian fluids in the same micro-geometry. Two
microchannels were studied, both with a centring cylinder of diameter 75
$\mathrm{\mu}$m, aspect ratio (channel height over width) of 0.37 and blockage
ratio (cylinder diameter over channel width) of 0.28, differing only on the
design of the pressure taps, located 500 $\mathrm{\mu}$m up- and downstream
from the respective cylinder face, on opposing walls. The working fluids
consist of two poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) solutions, a practically
non-shear-thinning elastic fluid and an elastic shear-thinning fluid.
Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and streak imaging techniques were used to
evaluate the flow over a Weissenberg number range: $100\leq Wi\leq 500$, while
maintaining a low Reynolds number, $Re<1$. The elastic shear-thinning solution
showed laterally asymmetric flow past the cylinder with both pressure tap
designs, while with the non-shear-thinning solution, asymmetric flow was only
observed with the wider pressure tap intake. In both cases, the fluids
preferentially chose the cylinder/wall gap opposing the upstream pressure tap,
which was found to influence the flow greatly, seemingly associated with
time-dependent flow and possibly the lateral flow asymmetry itself. This work
brings to light the necessary compromise between optimal pressure tap design
for quality pressure measurements and minimal flow interference, due to the
increased susceptibility of elastic microfluidic flows to flow perturbations

extreme-scale language models like GPT-3, which have fueled efforts towards
harvesting their knowledge into knowledge bases. However, access to inference
API for such models is limited, thereby restricting the scope and the diversity
of the knowledge acquisition. We thus ask a seemingly implausible question:
whether more accessible, yet considerably smaller and weaker models such as
GPT-2, can be utilized to acquire comparative knowledge, such that the
resulting quality is on par with their large-scale counterparts?
  We introduce NeuroComparatives, a novel framework for comparative knowledge
distillation using lexically-constrained decoding, followed by stringent
filtering of generated knowledge. Our framework acquires comparative knowledge
between everyday objects and results in a corpus of 8.7M comparisons over 1.74M

Moreover, human evaluations show that NeuroComparatives outperform existing

smaller models as a cost-effective alternative to the currently dominant

Beyond introducing novel modeling and derivations, we also offer convergence

Perturbation theory in the strength of integrability-breaking interaction $J_z$
is employed to estimate the decay rates of these modes, and compared to decay
rates obtained from exact diagonalization. The structure of the perturbation
theory and thus the lifetime of the modes is governed by the conservation of
quasi-energy modulo $2 \pi/T$, where $T$ is the period of the Floquet system.
If the quasi-energies of minimally $4 n-1$ quasi-particles adds up to zero (or
$\pi/T$ for a $\pi$ mode), the lifetime is proportional to $1/J_z^{2 n}$. Thus
the lifetime is sensitively controlled by the width of the single-particle
Floquet bands. For regimes where the decay rates are quadratic in $J_z$, an
analytic expression for the decay rate in terms of an infinite temperature
autocorrelation function of the integrable model is derived, and shown to agree
well with exact diagonalization.

Hercules increases in $V_\phi$ and becomes stronger as we move towards the
minor axis of the bar, and decreases in $V_\phi$ and becomes weaker as we move
towards the major axis of the bar. This is in direct agreement with theoretical
predictions of a long, slow bar model in which Hercules is formed by the

supporting the claim that such communication systems are articulated around
'reading contracts' upon which influencers' image is based and from which their
influence derives. While the upkeep of their influence relies on them sticking
to this contract, we observe that successful influencers shift their content
type when growing their audiences and explain the strategies they implement to
address this double bind. Different types of contract breaches then lead to
distinct outcomes, which we identify by analysing various types of followers'
feedback. In mediating social interactions, digital platforms reshape society

and accurate crop-specific information to various stakeholders. Dedicated
ground-based image acquisition exercises can help to collect data in data
scarce regions, improve control on timing of collection, or when study areas
are to small to monitor via satellite. Automatic labelling is essential when
collecting large volumes of data. One such data collection is the EU's Land Use
Cover Area frame Survey (LUCAS), and in particular, the recently published
LUCAS Cover photos database. The aim of this paper is to select and publish a
subset of LUCAS Cover photos for 12 mature major crops across the EU, to
deploy, benchmark, and identify the best configuration of Mobile-net for the
classification task, to showcase the possibility of using entropy-based metrics
for post-processing of results, and finally to show the applications and
limitations of the model in a practical and policy relevant context. In
particular, the usefulness of automatically identifying crops on geo-tagged
photos is illustrated in the context of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy.
The work has produced a dataset of 169,460 images of mature crops for the 12
classes, out of which 15,876 were manually selected as representing a clean
sample without any foreign objects or unfavorable conditions. The best
performing model achieved a Macro F1 (M-F1) of 0.75 on an imbalanced test
dataset of 8,642 photos. Using metrics from information theory, namely - the
Equivalence Reference Probability, resulted in achieving an increase of 6%. The
most unfavorable conditions for taking such images, across all crop classes,
were found to be too early or late in the season. The proposed methodology
shows the possibility for using minimal auxiliary data, outside the images
themselves, in order to achieve a M-F1 of 0.817 for labelling between 12 major
European crops.

large teacher models to a small student model. Typically, the student learns to
imitate the teacher by minimizing the KL divergence of its output distribution
with the teacher's output distribution. In this work, we argue that such a
learning objective is sub-optimal because there exists a discrepancy between
the teacher's output distribution and the ground truth label distribution.
Therefore, forcing the student to blindly imitate the unreliable teacher output
distribution leads to inferior performance. To this end, we propose a novel
knowledge distillation objective PTLoss by first representing the vanilla
KL-based distillation loss function via a Maclaurin series and then perturbing
the leading-order terms in this series. This perturbed loss implicitly
transforms the original teacher into a proxy teacher with a distribution closer
to the ground truth distribution. We establish the theoretical connection

principled way. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate PTLoss can

special tunable parameter {\epsilon} = {\epsilon}(n). Observe how Bn can be
viewed as the convex hull of both the TSP polytope, and the set of non-tour
permutation extrema, and, that its extended formulation is compact. Tours
(connected 2-factor permutation matrices when viewed as adjacency matrices) can
be distinguished from non-tours (disconnected 2-factor permutation matrices)
where {\epsilon} scales the magnitude of tweeks made to Bn. For {\epsilon} > 0,
Tn({\epsilon}) is tuned so that the convex hull of extrema corresponding to
transformed tours is lifted from Bn, and separated (by a hyperplane) from the
convex hull of extrema corresponding to translated non-tours. This leads to
creation of the feasible region of an LP model that can decide existence of a
tour in a graph based on an extended formulation of the TSP polytope. That is,
by designing for polynomial-time distinguishable tour extrema embedded in a
subspace disjoint from non-tour extrema, NP-completeness strongholds come into
play, necessarily expressed in a non-compact extended formulation of
Tn({\epsilon}) i.e. a compact extended formulation of the TSP polytope cannot
exist. No matter, Ted would have loved these ideas, and Tn({\epsilon}) might
one day yet be useful in the study of the P versus NP conundrum. In summary,
Tn({\epsilon}) is a perturbed Bn i.e. the convex hull of both an

For this task, 45 globular clusters were selected, 34 of which belong to the
bulge/bar and 11 to the disk. The most accurate astrometric data from the Gaia
satellite (Vasiliev and Baumgardt, 2021), as well as new refined average
distances (Baumgardt and Vasiliev, 2021), were used to form the 6D-phase space
required for orbit integration. The orbits of globular clusters are obtained
both in an axisymmetric potential and in a potential including a bar. In this
case, the mass, rotation velocity, shape and scale length of the bar were
varied. A comparison is made of such orbital parameters as apocentric and
pericentric distances, eccentricity and maximum distance from the galactic
plane. It is shown that the mass of the bar exerts the greatest influence on
the orbital motion, which is expressed mainly in an increase in both the
apocentric and pericentric distances in the vast majority of globular clusters.
The eccentricities of the orbits in the overwhelming majority also change
significantly, and there is a change both upward and downward, especially in
the range of values from 0.2 to 0.8. The greatest changes in parameters are
observed in globular clusters with high radial velocities and small pericentric
distances. The change in orbital parameters depending on the bar rotation
velocity is less pronounced. The influence of the geometric parameters of the
bar is insignificant in the accepted range of their changes. Several examples
show that globular clusters in the bulge are more affected by the bar than
those belonging to the disk.

been proposed to generalize conventional RIS. BD-RIS has a scattering matrix
that is not restricted to being diagonal and thus brings a performance
improvement over conventional RIS. While different BD-RIS architectures have
been proposed, it still remains an open problem to develop a systematic
approach to design BD-RIS architectures achieving the optimal trade-off between
performance and circuit complexity. In this work, we propose novel modeling,
architecture design, and optimization for BD-RIS based on graph theory. This
graph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS
architectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS.
Tree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the
least complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound
in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS
allows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further
decreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected
RIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected
RIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical
results confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the

significant interaction with a dense, pre-existing, circumstellar medium (CSM).
SNe Ibn comprise one such class that can be characterised by both rapidly
evolving light curves and persistent narrow He I lines. The origin of such a
dense CSM in these systems remains a pressing question, specifically concerning
the progenitor system and mass-loss mechanism. In this paper, we present
multi-wavelength data of the Type Ibn SN 2020nxt, including $HST$/STIS
ultraviolet spectra. We fit the data with recently updated CMFGEN models
designed to handle configurations for SNe Ibn. The UV coverage yields strong
constraints on the energetics and, when combined with the CMFGEN models, offer
new insight on potential progenitor systems. We find the most successful model
is a $\lesssim4 {\rm M}_\odot$ helium star that lost its $\sim 1\,{\rm
M}_\odot$ He-rich envelope in the years preceding core collapse. We also
consider viable alternatives, such as a He white dwarf merger. Ultimately, we
conclude at least some SNe Ibn do not arise from single, massive ($>30 {\rm

usually done on finite element (FE) meshes, allowing for flexible geometries.
Thus, any processing of the obtained reconstructions should be ideally done on
the FE mesh as well. For this purpose, we extend the hugely successful U-Net
architecture that is limited to rectangular pixel or voxel domains to an
equivalent that works flexibly on FE meshes. To achieve this, the FE mesh is
converted into a graph and we formulate a graph U-Net with a new cluster
pooling and unpooling on the graph that mimics the classic neighborhood based
max-pooling. We demonstrate effectiveness and flexibility of the graph U-Net
for improving reconstructions from electrical impedance tomographic (EIT)
measurements, a nonlinear and highly ill-posed inverse problem. The performance
is evaluated for simulated data and from three measurement devices with
different measurement geometries and instrumentations. We successfully show
that such networks can be trained with a simple two-dimensional simulated
training set and generalize to very different domains, including measurements
from a three-dimensional device and subsequent 3D reconstructions.

consider the scenario where the target domain is represented by a very
low-resolution (LR) image, proposing a domain-agnostic i2i method for
fine-grained problems, where the domains are related. More specifically, our
domain-agnostic approach aims at generating an image that combines visual
features from the source image with low-frequency information (e.g. pose,
color) of the LR target image. To do so, we present a novel approach that
relies on training the generative model to produce images that both share
distinctive information of the associated source image and correctly match the
LR target image when downscaled. We validate our method on the CelebA-HQ and
AFHQ datasets by demonstrating improvements in terms of visual quality.
Qualitative and quantitative results show that when dealing with intra-domain

Ever-growing core counts and datasets demand higher bandwidth and capacity as
well as lower latency from the memory system. To keep up with growing demands,
DDR--the dominant processor interface to memory over the past two decades--has
offered higher bandwidth with every generation. However, because each parallel
DDR interface requires a large number of on-chip pins, the processor's memory
bandwidth is ultimately restrained by its pin-count, which is a scarce
resource. With limited bandwidth, multiple memory requests typically contend
for each memory channel, resulting in significant queuing delays that often
overshadow DRAM's service time and degrade performance.
  We present CoaXiaL, a server design that overcomes memory bandwidth
limitations by replacing \textit{all} DDR interfaces to the processor with the
more pin-efficient CXL interface. The widespread adoption and industrial
momentum of CXL makes such a transition possible, offering $4\times$ higher
bandwidth per pin compared to DDR at a modest latency overhead. We demonstrate
that, for a broad range of workloads, CXL's latency premium is more than offset
by its higher bandwidth. As CoaXiaL distributes memory requests across more
channels, it drastically reduces queuing delays and thereby both the average
value and variance of memory access latency. Our evaluation with a variety of
workloads shows that CoaXiaL improves the performance of manycore
throughput-oriented servers by $1.52\times$ on average and by up to $3\times$.

interactions between excipients and proteins together with their concentrations
introduce an additional layer of complexity and in turn, method of modulating
protein stability. Here, we combined experimental measurements with molecular
dynamics simulations and graph-theory based analyses to assess the
stabilising/destabilising effects of different kinds of osmolytes on proteins
during heat-mediated denaturation. We found that (i) proteins in solution with
stability-enhancing osmolytes tend to have more compact interaction networks
than those assumed in presence of destabilising excipients; (ii) a strong
negative correlation (R = -0.85) characterises the relationship between the
melting temperature Tm and the preferential interaction coefficient defined by
the radial distribution functions of osmolytes and water around the protein and
(iii) a positive correlation exists between osmolyte-osmolyte clustering and
the extent of preferential exclusion from the local domain of the protein,
suggesting that exclusion may be driven by enhanced steric hindrance of
aggregated osmolytes.

a region of hot plasma near the central engine referred to as the corona. The
origin and geometry of the corona are poorly understood, and models invoking
either inflowing or outflowing material (or both) can successfully explain only
parts of the observed phenomenology. In particular, recent works indicate that
the time-averaged and variability property might originate in different regions
of the corona. In this paper we present a model designed to move beyond the
lamp post paradigm, with the goal of accounting for the vertical extent of the
corona. In particular, we highlight the impact of including self consistently a
second lamp post, mimicking for example an extended jet base. We fully include
the effect that the second source has on the time-dependent disk ionization,
reflection spectrum, and reverberation lags. We also present an application of
this new model to NICER observations of the X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 near
its hard-to-soft state transition. We demonstrate that in these observations, a
vertically extended corona can capture both spectral and timing properties,
while a single lamp post model can not. In this scenario, the illumination
responsible for the time-averaged spectrum originates close to the black hole,
while the variability is likely associated with the ballistic jet.

$\kappa$ for temperatures and pressures relevant to the conditions of the Earth
mantle, between 1,000 and 2,000 K and up to 22 GPa. We employ close to
equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and a deep neural network potential
fitted to density functional theory data. We then interpret our results by
computing the equation of state of water on a fine grid of points and using a

dependent on temperature and monotonically increases with pressure with an
approximate square-root behavior. In addition we show how the increase of
$\kappa$ at high pressure, relative to ambient conditions, is related to the
corresponding increase in the sound velocity. Although the relationships
between the thermal conductivity, pressure and sound velocity established here
are not rigorous, they are sufficiently accurate to allow for a robust estimate

equilibrium, the mantle of these planets would be rich in reduced carbon but
have relatively low water (hydrogen) content. Outgassing would naturally yield
the ingredients for haze production when exposed to stellar UV photons in the
upper atmosphere. Obscuring atmospheric hazes appear common in the exoplanetary
inventory based on the presence of often featureless transmission spectra

tests have been developed to characterize the fracture behavior of AC. Accurate
crack detection during testing is crucial to describe AC fracture behavior.
This paper proposed a framework to detect surface cracks in AC specimens using
two-dimensional digital image correlation (DIC). Two significant drawbacks in
previous research in this field were addressed. First, a multi-seed incremental
reliability-guided DIC was proposed to solve the decorrelation issue due to
large deformation and discontinuities. The method was validated using synthetic
deformed images. A correctly implemented analysis could accurately measure
strains up to 450\%, even with significant discontinuities (cracks) present in
the deformed image. Second, a robust method was developed to detect cracks
based on displacement fields. The proposed method uses critical crack tip
opening displacement ($\delta_c$) to define the onset of cleavage fracture. The
proposed method relies on well-developed fracture mechanics theory. The
proposed threshold $\delta_c$ has a physical meaning and can be easily
determined from DIC measurement. The method was validated using an extended
finite element model. The framework was implemented to measure the crack
propagation rate while conducting the Illinois-flexibility index test on two AC
mixes. The calculated rates could distinguish mixes based on their cracking
potential. The proposed framework could be applied to characterize AC cracking
phenomenon, evaluate its fracture properties, assess asphalt mixture testing
protocols, and develop theoretical models.

activated via the external StringSpinner package, which is based on the
string+${}^3P_0$ model of polarized hadronization, and were restricted to the
production of pseudoscalar mesons in string fragmentation. The struck quark
polarization could either be calculated using parametrizations of the

vector mesons are described using the string+${}^3P_0$ model, which
systematically accounts for the quark-spin degree of freedom in the
fragmentation chain. The new package works with the version 8.3 of the PYTHIA

of the final states in polarized semi-inclusive DIS events. Also, it can be
used to study the transverse-spin effects for the production of vector mesons.
After describing the new version of StringSpinner, examples of its usage in
semi-inclusive DIS events are presented.

(GPT), have achieved tremendous success in various language tasks, but their
emergent abilities have also raised many questions, concerns, and challenges
that need to be addressed. To gain a better understanding of the models' inner
mechanisms, we analyze the hidden state and channel wave dynamics in a small
GPT, focusing on the coherence of wave patterns in terms of cross-channel
correlation and individual auto-correlation. Our findings suggest that wave
dynamics offer consistent and repeatable intrinsic oscillation modes, along
with context-aware plasticity and expressiveness in language generation. By
analyzing wave patterns, coherence, and clustering, we provide a systematic way
to identify and interpret the functionality of the hidden state channels,
paving the way to understand and control higher-level language pattern
formation. In addition, we investigate the Poisson statistics of spelling
errors in text sequence generation across various levels of model training and
observe a phase-transition-like process. As coherence builds up, there is a
competition between the generation of correct and misspelled words. However,
once the model is adequately trained and significant coherence has emerged, the
coherent process becomes strong enough to effectively suppress spelling errors,
preventing the cascade amplification of defects. The distribution of correct
spellings transitions from Poissonian to Sub-Poissonian, while the distribution
of misspellings shows the opposite trend. By leveraging concepts and techniques
from quantum physics, we gain novel insights into the dynamics of the small
GPT. This approach can be extended to larger language models that exhibit more
complex coherent language patterns, opening up opportunities to interpret their
emergent capabilities and develop more specialized models.

low-cost, scalable and privacy-preserving edge computing framework for
multi-person localization, i.e. estimating the positions, orientations, and
trajectories of multiple people in an indoor space. Our computing framework
consists of 38 Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)-enabled edge computing camera
systems placed in the ceiling of the indoor therapeutic space. The edge compute
systems are connected to an on-premise fog server through a secure and private
network. A multi-person detection algorithm and a pose estimation model run on
the edge TPU in real-time to collect features which are used, instead of raw
images, for downstream computations. This ensures the privacy of individuals in
the space, reduces data transmission/storage and improves scalability. We
implemented a Kalman filter-based multi-person tracking method and a
state-of-the-art body orientation estimation method to determine the positions
and facing orientations of multiple people simultaneously in the indoor space.
For our study site with size of 18,000 square feet, our system demonstrated an
average localization error of 1.41 meters, a multiple-object tracking accuracy
score of 62%, and a mean absolute body orientation error of 29{\deg}, which is
sufficient for understanding group activity behaviors in indoor environments.
Additionally, our study provides practical guidance for deploying the proposed
system by analyzing various elements of the camera installation with respect to

new single-stage paradigm: a generative retrieval model which autoregressively
decodes the identifiers for the target candidates in one phase. To do this,
instead of assigning randomly generated atomic IDs to each item, we generate
Semantic IDs: a semantically meaningful tuple of codewords for each item that
serves as its unique identifier. We use a hierarchical method called RQ-VAE to
generate these codewords. Once we have the Semantic IDs for all the items, a
Transformer based sequence-to-sequence model is trained to predict the Semantic
ID of the next item. Since this model predicts the tuple of codewords
identifying the next item directly in an autoregressive manner, it can be
considered a generative retrieval model. We show that our recommender system
trained in this new paradigm improves the results achieved by current SOTA
models on the Amazon dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that the
sequence-to-sequence model coupled with hierarchical Semantic IDs offers better
generalization and hence improves retrieval of cold-start items for

self-interactions at small scales. In this work we select 9 isolated galaxies

the halo gravothermal evolution processes. We then constrain the parameters of
a cross section model $\sigma(v)=\sigma_0/(1+v^2/\omega^2)^2$ with the measured
rotation curves and stellar kinematics through the gravothermal fluid formalism

dynamically adjust the capacity ratio between two adjacent levels as more data

merge more often. In particular, the point and range read cost improves from
the previous best known $O(logN)$ complexity to $O(\sqrt{logN})$ in Autumn by
applying the new novel Garnering merge policy. While Garnering merge policy
optimizes for both point reads and range reads, it maintains high performance

vortex coronagraphs (SVCs) are an attractive alternative to vector vortex
coronagraphs (VVCs). VVCs have demonstrated 2e-9 raw contrast in broadband

manifold being conformally flat. It is always possible to construct orthogonal
coordinates on 2-manifolds, using geometric normal coordinates or isothermal
coordinates. In 1984, Dennis DeTurck and Dean Yang [4] showed the existence of
orthogonal coordinates on any Riemannian 3-manifold. Thus there are manifolds
which have orthogonal coordinates, but are not conformally flat, since the
Cotton tensor presents an obstruction to conformal flatness in dimension 3.
They also showed that, for dimensions at least 4, there is apparently an
obstruction to the existence of orthogonal coordinates, in that curvature
components of the form R_{ijkl}, with all 4 indices distinct, will vanish if
the directions correspond to orthogonal coordinates. Thus, in high dimensions,
the existence of orthogonal coordinates implies a certain sparseness of the
Riemannian curvature tensor. Recently, Paul Gauduchon and Andrei Moroianu
showed [5] that there are no orthogonal coordinates on complex or quaternionic
projective space except for trivial cases.
  The main results of this work are that no nontrivial self-dual K\""ahler
4-manifold (4 real dimensions) supports orthogonal local coordinates, and also
no nontrivial Ricci-flat K\""ahler 4-manifold supports orthogonal coordinates.
The first result uses the same technique developed by Gauduchon and Moroianu in

experimentally investigate the evolutionary reason for the existence of the
false thumbs of red pandas. These thumbs were once believed to have shared a
common origin with the similar false thumbs of giant pandas; however, the
discovery of a carnivorous fossil ancestor of the red panda that had false
thumbs implies that the red panda did not evolve its thumbs to assist in eating
bamboo, as the giant panda did, but rather evolved its thumbs for some other
purpose. The leading proposal for this purpose is that the thumbs developed to
aid arboreal locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we conducted grasp tests on
rods 5-15 mm in diameter using a biomimetic paw with 0-16 mm interchangeable
thumb lengths. The results of these tests demonstrated an optimal thumb length
of 7 mm, which is just above that of the red panda's true thumb length of 5.5
mm. Given trends in the data that suggest that smaller thumbs are better suited
to grasping larger diameter rods, we conclude that the red panda's thumb being
sized below the optimum length suggests an adaptation toward grasping branches
as opposed to relatively thinner food items, supporting the new proposal that
the red panda's thumbs are an adaptation primary to climbing rather than food
manipulation.

a class of SRRWs parameterized by a positive real {\alpha}, we prove that the

decoding, which can be highly expensive. However, for some downstream tasks
such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and resource allocation, the actual
decoding output is not needed just a scalar attribute of this sequence. In
these scenarios, where for example knowing the quality of a system's output to
predict poor performance prevails over knowing the output itself, is it
possible to bypass the autoregressive decoding? We propose Non-Autoregressive
Proxy (NAP) models that can efficiently predict general scalar-valued
sequence-level attributes. Importantly, NAPs predict these metrics directly
from the encodings, avoiding the expensive autoregressive decoding stage. We
consider two sequence-to-sequence task: Machine Translation (MT); and Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR). In OOD for MT, NAPs outperform a deep ensemble while
being significantly faster. NAPs are also shown to be able to predict
performance metrics such as BERTScore (MT) or word error rate (ASR). For
downstream tasks, such as data filtering and resource optimization, NAPs
generate performance predictions that outperform predictive uncertainty while

introducing higher-level abstractions -- role and channel -- using which
federated learning applications are described as Topology Abstraction Graphs

reducing development effort and paving the way for improved automation and

the flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP). In FJSP, operations can be
processed on multiple machines, leading to intricate relationships between
operations and machines. Recent works have employed deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving FJSP. However, the
quality of solutions still has room for improvement relative to that by the
exact methods such as OR-Tools. To address this issue, this paper presents a
novel end-to-end learning framework that weds the merits of self-attention
models for deep feature extraction and DRL for scalable decision-making. The
complex relationships between operations and machines are represented precisely
and concisely, for which a dual-attention network (DAN) comprising several
interconnected operation message attention blocks and machine message attention
blocks is proposed. The DAN exploits the complicated relationships to construct
production-adaptive operation and machine features to support high-quality
decisionmaking. Experimental results using synthetic data as well as public
benchmarks corroborate that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional
PDRs and the state-of-the-art DRL method. Moreover, it achieves results
comparable to exact methods in certain cases and demonstrates favorable
generalization ability to large-scale and real-world unseen FJSP tasks.

information for the prediction of currently being excavated ground properties.
The real-time information refers to the real-time operating parameters of the

generalization of prefix sorting from strings to labeled graphs. WNFAs admit
optimal solutions to classic hard problems on labeled graphs and languages. The
problem of deciding whether a given NFA is Wheeler is known to be NP-complete.
Recently, however, Alanko et al. showed how to side-step this complexity by
switching to preorders: letting $Q$ be the set of states, $E$ the set of
transitions, $|Q|=n$, and $|E|=m$, they provided a $O(mn^2)$-time algorithm
computing a totally-ordered partition of the WNFA's states such that (1)
equivalent states recognize the same regular language, and (2) the order of
non-equivalent states is consistent with any Wheeler order, when one exists.
Then, the output is a preorder of the states as useful for pattern matching as
standard Wheeler orders. Further research generalized these concepts to
arbitrary NFAs by introducing co-lex partial preorders: any NFA admits a
partial preorder of its states reflecting the co-lex order of their accepted
strings; the smaller the width of such preorder is, the faster regular
expression matching queries can be performed. To date, the fastest algorithm
for computing the smallest-width partial preorder on NFAs runs in
$O(m^2+n^{5/2})$ time, while on DFAs the same can be done in $O(\min(n^2\log
n,mn))$ time. In this paper, we provide much more efficient solutions to the
problem above. Our results are achieved by extending a classic algorithm for
the relational coarsest partition refinement problem to work with ordered
partitions. Specifically, we provide a $O(m\log n)$-time algorithm computing a
co-lex total preorder when the input is a WNFA, and an algorithm with the same
time complexity computing the smallest-width co-lex partial order of any DFA.
Also, we present implementations of our algorithms and show that they are very
efficient in practice.

theory of real price that determines the optimal global versus local spending
of an agent which achieves the agent's optimal tradeoff between spending and
obtained utility. Our theory of real price depends on the asymptotic analysis
of a Markov chain transition probability matrix related to the network of
producers and consumers. We show that the real price of a product or service
can be determined from the involved Markov chain matrix, and can be
dramatically different from the product's label price. In particular, we show
that the label prices of products and services are often not ``real'' or
directly ``useful'': given two products offering the same myopic utility, the
one with lower label price may not necessarily offer better asymptotic utility.
This theory shows that the globality or locality of the products and services
does have different impacts on the spending-utility tradeoff of a customer. The
established mathematical theory of real price can be used to determine whether
to adopt or not to adopt certain artificial intelligence (AI) technologies from
an economic perspective.

the marked ROI. In this paper, we present a novel mammographic mass
localisation framework, based on the maximal class activations of the stacked
auto-encoders. We hypothesize that the image regions activating abnormal
classes in mammographic images will be the breast masses which causes the
anomaly. The experiment is conducted using randomly selected 200 mammographic
images (100 normal and 100 abnormal) from IRMA mammographic dataset. Abnormal
mass regions marked by an expert radiologist are used as the ground truth. The
proposed method outperforms existing Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)
based techniques in terms of salient region detection accuracy. The proposed
greedy backtracking method is more efficient and does not require a vast number
of labelled training images as in DCNN based method. Such automatic
localisation method will assist physicians to make accurate decisions on biopsy
recommendations and treatment evaluations.

active user's transmission Markov process by its mean and temporal process. We
show that any moment of the AoI can be expressed a function of the mean and

the Klein-Nishina (KN) effect of the inverse Compton scattering leads to less
efficient energy losses of high-energy electrons. In the other hand, at a
redshift of 0.151, the TeV spectrum of GRB 221009A undergoes significant
absorption by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL). Therefore, the
observation of 18-TeV and 250-TeV photons in this event implies the presence of
enormous photon fluxes at the source, which cannot be easily generated by the
Synchrotron Self-Compton mechanism in external shocks. As an alternative, some
authors have suggested the possibility of converting the TeV-photons into
Axion-like particles (ALPs) at the host galaxy, in order to avoid the effects
of EBL absorption, and then reconverting them into photons within the Milky
Way. While this solution relaxes the requirement of very-high photon fluxes,

injections of ALPs could explain the observation of 18-TeV photons. Here, we

as the location in the 3D space and on the tree structure. We use a neural
network pipeline to train a situated latent space that allows us to locally
predict branch growth only based on a single node in the branch graph of a tree

thereby mimicking the growth process of trees. Starting from a root node, a
tree is generated by iteratively querying the neural network on the newly added
nodes resulting in the branching structure of the whole tree. Our method
enables generating a wide variety of tree shapes without the need to define
intricate parameters that control their growth and behavior. Furthermore, we
show that the situated latents can also be used to encode the environmental

to generate pseudo labels by expanding the seeds from CAMs which is complex and
time-consuming, thus hindering the design of efficient end-to-end
(single-stage) WSSS approaches. To tackle the above dilemma, we resort to the
off-the-shelf and readily accessible saliency maps for directly obtaining
pseudo labels given the image-level class labels. Nevertheless, the salient
regions may contain noisy labels and cannot seamlessly fit the target objects,
and saliency maps can only be approximated as pseudo labels for simple images
containing single-class objects. As such, the achieved segmentation model with
these simple images cannot generalize well to the complex images containing
multi-class objects. To this end, we propose an end-to-end multi-granularity
denoising and bidirectional alignment (MDBA) model, to alleviate the noisy
label and multi-class generalization issues. Specifically, we propose the
online noise filtering and progressive noise detection modules to tackle
image-level and pixel-level noise, respectively. Moreover, a bidirectional

stream is investigated through direct numerical simulation. The incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations with surface tension and phase change are solved in
conjunction with the energy equations of each phase. The sharp liquid-gas
interface is tracked using the geometric Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method and an
immersed Dirichlet boundary condition for temperature is imposed at the
interface. The simulation approach is validated by simulating water and acetone
drops at nearly-zero Weber numbers, and the simulation results are found to
agree very well with the empirical relation for spherical drops. Parametric
simulations were conducted to investigate the aerodynamic breakup of vaporizing
drops at low to moderate Weber and Reynolds numbers. The range of Weber numbers
considered has covered the vibrational and bag breakup regimes. Through the
simulation results, we have characterized the impact of drop deformation and
breakup on the drop vaporization rate. When the drop Weber number increases,
the windward surface area increases more rapidly over time. As a result, the
rate of drop volume reduction also increases. The correlation between the
vaporization rate and the windward surface area is examined for different Weber
and Reynolds numbers. Based on the approximate correlation between the drop
vaporization rate and the windward surface area and the TAB model for drop
deformation, a new time-dependent drop vaporization model is proposed. The
present model achieves a good agreement with simulation results and shows a
significant improvement over the conventional model for spherical drops.

macro-level or simplified micro-level vaccine distribution by assuming the
homogeneous behavior within subgroup populations and lacking mobility dynamics
integration. Directly applying these models for micro-level vaccine allocation
leads to sub-optimal solutions due to the lack of behavioral-related details.
To address the issue, we first incorporate the mobility heterogeneity in
disease dynamics modeling and mimic the disease evolution process using a
Trans-vaccine-SEIR model. Then we develop a novel deep reinforcement learning
to seek the optimal vaccine allocation strategy for the high-degree
spatial-temporal disease evolution system. The graph neural network is used to
effectively capture the structural properties of the mobility contact network
and extract the dynamic disease features. In our evaluation, the proposed
framework reduces 7% - 10% of infections and deaths than the baseline
strategies. Extensive evaluation shows that the proposed framework is robust to
seek the optimal vaccine allocation with diverse mobility patterns in the
micro-level disease evolution system. In particular, we find the optimal
vaccine allocation strategy in the transit usage restriction scenario is
significantly more effective than restricting cross-zone mobility for the top
10% age-based and income-based zones. These results provide valuable insights
for areas with limited vaccines and low logistic efficacy.

While transformer-based methods have exhibited high efficiency in single-image
super-resolution tasks, they have not yet shown significant advantages over
CNN-based methods in stereo super-resolution tasks. This can be attributed to
two key factors: first, current single-image super-resolution transformers are
unable to leverage the complementary stereo information during the process;
second, the performance of transformers is typically reliant on sufficient
data, which is absent in common stereo-image super-resolution algorithms. To
address these issues, we propose a Hybrid Transformer and CNN Attention Network
(HTCAN), which utilizes a transformer-based network for single-image
enhancement and a CNN-based network for stereo information fusion. Furthermore,
we employ a multi-patch training strategy and larger window sizes to activate
more input pixels for super-resolution. We also revisit other advanced
techniques, such as data augmentation, data ensemble, and model ensemble to
reduce overfitting and data bias. Finally, our approach achieved a score of
23.90dB and emerged as the winner in Track 1 of the NTIRE 2023 Stereo Image
Super-Resolution Challenge.

succession dynamics without specifying detailed function forms. The model is
evaluated in idealized terrestrial ecosystems, where disturbances are modeled
as a reduction in available resources that triggers inter-species competition.
The resource-firing game is executed on a finite graph with nodes representing
species in the community and a sink node that becomes active when every species
is depleted of resources. First, we discuss the theoretical basis of the
resource-firing game, evaluate it in the light of existing literature, and
consider the characteristics of a biocrust community that has evolved to
equilibrium. We then examine the dependence of resource-firing and game
stability on species richness, showing that high species richness increases the
probability of very short and long avalanches, but not those of intermediate
length. Indeed, this result suggests that the response of the community to
disturbance is both directional and episodic, proceeding towards reverse
succession in bursts of variable length. Finally, we incorporate the spatial
structure of the biocrust community into a Cayley Tree and derive a formula for
the probability that a disturbance, modeled as a random attack, initiates a

testing of the SPINA system was successfully performed on UT 2022 Jul 10, on
the 0.7-meter aperture Nazarbayev University Transient Telescope at the
Assy-Turgen Astrophysical Observatory (NUTTelA-TAO). We measured stars with a
wide range of brightness and a dark region of the sky without stars $< 18$ mag.
We measured the SPINA system's spatial resolution to be $<232\mu m$ (full-width
half-maximum, FWHM), limited by the unstable atmosphere. We measured the total
background noise (detector dark counts and sky background) of 1914 counts per
second (cps) within this resolution element. We also performed a crosstalk
mapping of the detector, obtaining the crosstalk probability of $\sim0.18$ near
the detector's center while reaching $\sim 50\%$ at the edges. We derived a
$5\sigma$ sensitivity of $17.45$ Gaia-BP magnitude in a 1s exposure with no
atmospheric extinction by comparing the received flux with Gaia-BP band data.
For a $10ms$ window and a false alarm rate of once per 100 nights, we derived a
transient sensitivity of 14.06 mag. For a $1\mu s$ or faster time scale, we are
limited by crosstalk to a 15 P.E. detection threshold. In addition, we

  Survival Outcome Using Restricted Mean Survival Time",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature screening is an important tool in analyzing ultrahigh-dimensional
data, particularly in the field of Omics and oncology studies. However, most
attention has been focused on identifying features that have a linear or
monotonic impact on the response variable. Detecting a sparse set of variables
that have a nonlinear or non-monotonic relationship with the response variable
is still a challenging task. To fill the gap, this paper proposed a robust
model-free screening approach for right-censored survival data by providing a
new perspective of quantifying the covariate effect on the restricted mean
survival time, rather than the routinely used hazard function. The proposed
measure, based on the difference between the restricted mean survival time of
covariate-stratified and overall data, is able to identify comprehensive types
of associations including linear, nonlinear, non-monotone, and even local
dependencies like change points. This approach is highly interpretable and
flexible without any distribution assumption. The sure screening property is
established and an iterative screening procedure is developed to address
multicollinearity between high-dimensional covariates. Simulation studies are
carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in selecting
important features with a complex association with the response variable. The
potential of applying the proposed method to handle interval-censored failure
time data has also been explored in simulations, and the results have been
promising. The method is applied to a breast cancer dataset to identify
potential prognostic factors, which reveals potential associations between
breast cancer and lymphoma.

related to the feature extraction ability, i.e., the ability to recognize and

quantitatively and statistically illustrate that DNNs have a serious attention

DNNs fully focus on label-independent regions; (2) Range bias: The focused
regions from DNN are not completely contained in the ideal region. Moreover, we
find that the existing self-attention modules can alleviate these biases to a
certain extent, but the biases are still non-negligible. To further mitigate
them, we propose a lightweight sub-attention strategy (LSAS), which utilizes
high-order sub-attention modules to improve the original self-attention

state-of-the-art automatic dubbing systems only model the transfer on duration

model is then fine-tuned using the conventional contrastive alignment objective
and a margin loss to distinguish between normal and hard negative data. HELIP
is deployed in a plug-and-play fashion to existing models. On a comprehensive
zero-shot and retrieval benchmark, without training the model from scratch or
utilizing additional data, HELIP consistently boosts existing models to achieve
leading performance. In particular, HELIP boosts ImageNet zero-shot accuracy of
SLIP by 3.05 and 4.47 when pretrained on CC3M and CC12M respectively. In
addition, a systematic evaluation of zero-shot and linear probing experiments
across fine-grained classification datasets demonstrates a consistent

of the most fundamental processes in galaxy formation and evolution. Studying
this process directly in the early universe is hindered by the weakness of the
hyperfine 21-cm HI line transition, impeding direct detections and measurements
of the HI gas masses ($M_{\rm HI}$). Here we present a new method to infer
$M_{\rm HI}$ of high-redshift galaxies using neutral, atomic oxygen as a proxy.
Specifically, we derive metallicity-dependent conversion factors relating the
far-infrared [OI]-$63\mu$m and [OI]-$145\mu$m emission line luminosities and
$M_{\rm HI}$ in star-forming galaxies at $z\approx 2-6$ using gamma-ray bursts
(GRBs) as probes. We substantiate these results by observations of galaxies at
$z\approx 0$ with direct measurements of $M_{\rm HI}$ and [OI]-$63\mu$m and
[OI]-$145\mu$m in addition to hydrodynamical simulations at similar epochs. We
find that the [OI]$_{\rm 63\mu m}$-to-HI and [OI]$_{\rm 145\mu m}$-to-HI
conversion factors universally appears to be anti-correlated with the gas-phase
metallicity. The high-redshift GRB measurements further predict a mean ratio of
$L_{\rm [OI]-63\mu m} / L_{\rm [OI]-145\mu m}=1.55\pm 0.12$ and reveal
generally less excited [CII]. The $z \approx 0$ galaxy sample also shows
systematically higher $\beta_{\rm [OI]-63\mu m}$ and $\beta_{\rm [OI]-145\mu
m}$ conversion factors than the GRB sample, indicating either suppressed [OI]
emission in local galaxies or more extended, diffuse HI gas reservoirs traced
by the HI 21-cm. Finally, we apply these empirical calibrations to the few
high-redshift detections of [OI]-$63\mu$m and [OI]-$145\mu$m line transitions
from the literature and further discuss the applicability of these conversion
factors to probe the HI gas content in the dense, star-forming ISM of galaxies

lexical divergences between the HRL and LRL and better facilitates
cross-lingual transfer. On closely related HRL and LRL pairs from multiple

+/- 2.31 hours and the standard phase function parameters H and G as 16.05 +/-
0.05, 0.22 +/- 0.02, respectively. Our colour index (V-R) measurement of 0.45
+/- 0.02 is consistent with spectroscopic observations, indicating an S (or
sub-S) spectral type. Using the polarimetric and spectroscopic data, we found
that the geometric albedo is 0.15 +/- 0.03, and the spectral type is Sq. Based
on the estimated albedo and absolute magnitude, Baboquivari has an effective
diameter of 2.12 +/- 0.21 km. Due to the scattered data in the light curve, its
slow rotation and location among the NEAs suggest that Baboquivari may be a
non-principal axis (NPA) rotator.

various geotechnical risks, including landslides and debris flows. Granular
flows involve a dynamic rearrangement of particles exhibiting complex
transitions from solid-like to fluid-like responses. Traditional continuum and
discrete numerical methods are limited by their computational cost in
simulating large-scale systems. Statistical or machine learning-based models
offer an alternative. Still, they are largely empirical, based on a limited set
of parameters. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, traditional machine
learning-based models require huge training data to generalize. To resolve
these problems, we use a graph neural network, a state-of-the-art machine
learning architecture that learns local interactions. Graphs represent the
state of dynamically changing granular flows and the interaction laws, such as
energy and momentum exchange between grains. We develop a graph neural
network-based simulator (GNS) that takes the current state of granular flow and
predicts the next state using Euler explicit integration by learning the local
interaction laws. We train GNS on different granular trajectories. We then
assess the performance of GNS by predicting granular column collapse. GNS
accurately predicts flow dynamics for column collapses with different aspect
ratios unseen during training. GNS is hundreds of times faster than
high-fidelity numerical simulators. The model also generalizes to domains much
larger than the training data, handling more than twice the number of particles
than it was trained on.

complete model training by making isolated data islands of different

parameters for multiple communication rounds. In cross-silo FL, an incentive
mechanism is indispensable for motivating data owners to contribute their
models to FL training. However, how to allocate the reward budget among
different rounds is an essential but complicated problem largely overlooked by
existing works. The challenge of this problem lies in the opaque feedback

the optimal reward budget allocation complicated. To address this problem, we
design an online reward budget allocation algorithm using Bayesian optimization

incentive mechanisms to illustrate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments are
conducted on real datasets to demonstrate that BARA significantly outperforms
competitive baselines by improving model utility with the same amount of reward

recognition teacher encoder, while the sequential encoder and decoder are
improved by transferring knowledge from the translation sequential and decoder

distillations are incorporated to better boost the translation performance.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed MTKD effectively improves
the text image translation performance and outperforms existing end-to-end and

does not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial
encoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads
during inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named
the spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent
features from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.
Additionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it
is better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals
and difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only
learn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the
ST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT
to a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.
More importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into
the future.

  Aims. We investigated the similarities and differences in the pulsational

searched for new pulsation modes for asteroseismology.
  Methods. We performed Fourier analysis of the light curves using the standard
pre-whitening process, and compared the results with frequencies obtained from
the earlier data. Utilising the 2018 version of the White Dwarf Evolution Code,
we also performed an asteroseismic analysis of the different stars. We searched
for models with seismic distances in the vicinity of the Gaia geometric

  Results. We detected several new possible pulsation modes of the studied
pulsators. In the case of HE 0532-5605, we found a similar brightening phase to
the one presented in the 2020 first-light paper, which means this phenomenon is
recurring. Therefore, HE 0532-5605 appears to be a new outbursting DAV star. We
also detected a lower-amplitude brightening phase in the star WD J0925+0509.

informative experimental tool sensitive to electronic dynamics in materials,
widely exploited in diverse research fields. Typically, Tr-XES/XAS requires
X-ray pulses with both a narrow bandwidth and sub-picosecond pulse duration, a
combination that in principle finds its optimum with Fourier transform-limited
pulses. In this work, we explore an alternative xperimental approach, capable
of simultaneously retrieving information about unoccupied (XAS) and occupied
(XES) states from the stochastic fluctuations of broadband extreme ultraviolet
pulses of a free-electron laser. We used this method, in combination with
singular value decomposition and Tikhonov regularization procedures, to
determine the XAS/XES response from a crystalline silicon sample at the
L2,3-edge, with an energy resolution of a few tens of meV. Finally, we combined
this spectroscopic method with a pump-probe approach to measure structural and
electronic dynamics of a silicon membrane. Tr-XAS/XES data obtained after
photoexcitation with an optical laser pulse at 390 nm allowed us to observe
perturbations of the band structure, which are compatible with the formation of
the predicted precursor state of a non-thermal solid-liquid phase transition
associated with a bond softening phenomenon.

result from gravitational interaction with an invisible secondary whose mass

many scientific inquiries. A major barrier to such inference is the problem of
subsampling, i.e., the frequency of measurement is much lower than that of
causal influence. To overcome this problem, numerous methods have been
proposed, yet either was limited to the linear case or failed to achieve
identifiability. In this paper, we propose a constraint-based algorithm that
can identify the entire causal structure from subsampled time series, without
any parametric constraint. Our observation is that the challenge of subsampling
arises mainly from hidden variables at the unobserved time steps. Meanwhile,
every hidden variable has an observed proxy, which is essentially itself at
some observable time in the future, benefiting from the temporal structure.
Based on these, we can leverage the proxies to remove the bias induced by the
hidden variables and hence achieve identifiability. Following this intuition,
we propose a proxy-based causal discovery algorithm. Our algorithm is
nonparametric and can achieve full causal identification. Theoretical
advantages are reflected in synthetic and real-world experiments.

to go camping or hold a birthday party, is critically important for an
E-commerce platform; it can help boost the quality of shopping experience by
enabling provision of more relevant, explainable, and diversified
recommendations. However, such high level shopping intent has been overlooked
in the industry due to practical challenges. In this work, we introduce
Amazon's new system that explicitly identifies and utilizes each customer's
high level shopping intents for personalizing recommendations. We develop a
novel technique that automatically identifies various high level goals being
pursued by the Amazon customers, such as ""go camping"", and ""preparing for a
beach party"". Our solution is in a scalable fashion (in 14 languages across 21
countries). Then a deep learning model maps each customer's online behavior,
e.g. product search and individual item engagements, into a subset of high
level shopping intents. Finally, a realtime ranker considers both the
identified intents as well as the granular engagements to present personalized
intent-aware recommendations. Extensive offline analysis ensures accuracy and
relevance of the new recommendations and we further observe an 10% improvement
in the business metrics. This system is currently serving online traffic at
amazon.com, powering several production features, driving significant business

The
existence of unobserved variables, such as latent confounders or mediators, can
mislead the causal identification. To address this issue, proximal causal
discovery methods proposed to adjust for the bias with the proxy of the
unobserved variable. However, these methods presumed the data is discrete,
which limits their real-world application. In this paper, we propose a proximal
causal discovery method that can well handle the continuous variables. Our
observation is that discretizing continuous variables can can lead to serious
errors and comprise the power of the proxy. Therefore, to use proxy variables
in the continuous case, the critical point is to control the discretization
error. To this end, we identify mild regularity conditions on the conditional
distributions, enabling us to control the discretization error to an
infinitesimal level, as long as the proxy is discretized with sufficiently
fine, finite bins. Based on this, we design a proxy-based hypothesis test for
identifying causal relationships when unobserved variables are present. Our
test is consistent, meaning it has ideal power when large samples are
available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using synthetic and
real-world data.

  Time",,,,,"cs.CR cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting techniques is
negatively impacted when the training data is not temporally close to the
testing data. This can limit the practical implementation of physical-layer
authentication solutions. To circumvent this problem, current solutions involve
collecting training and testing datasets at close time intervals -- this being
detrimental to the real-life deployment of any physical-layer authentication
solution. We refer to this issue as the Day-After-Tomorrow (DAT) effect, being
widely attributed to the temporal variability of the wireless channel, which
masks the physical-layer features of the transmitter, thus impairing the
fingerprinting process.
  In this work, we investigate the DAT effect shedding light on its root
causes. Our results refute previous knowledge by demonstrating that the DAT
effect is not solely caused by the variability of the wireless channel.
Instead, we prove that it is also due to the power-cycling of the radios, i.e.,
the turning off and on of the radios between the collection of training and
testing data. We show that state-of-the-art RF fingerprinting solutions double
their performance when the devices under test are not power-cycled, i.e., the
accuracy increases from about 0.5 to about 1 in a controlled scenario.
  Finally, we propose a new technique to mitigate the DAT effect in real-world
scenarios. Our experimental results show a significant improvement in accuracy,
from approximately 0.45 to 0.85. Additionally, our solution reduces the
variance of the results, making the overall performance more reliable.

parity-check (LDPC) codes, and a near Shannon limit error-rate performance is
obtained. However, the decoders presented in previous literature suffer from a
large resource consumption due to the accumulative calculations for each
extrinsic message updating. In this paper, check belief is introduced as the
probability that the corresponding parity check is satisfied. A check belief
propagation (CBP) algorithm is proposed, which can force all the check nodes to
contribute their check beliefs to others in a sequential order. The check nodes
will enlarge the check beliefs of all the check nodes iteratively. This can
result in positive check beliefs for all the check nodes, which indicates that
all the parity checks are successfully satisfied. Different from previous BP
algorithms, the check beliefs are propagated with no accumulative calculations
at an acceptable speed, with low complexity and without performance loss. The
simulation results and analyses show that the CBP algorithm provides a similar
prominent error-rate performance as the previous BP algorithms, but consumes a
lot fewer resources than them. It earns a big benefit in terms of complexity.

of robotics systems within previously visited environments. When visits occur
over long periods of time, changes in the environment related to seasons or
day-night cycles present a major challenge. Under water, the sources of
variability are due to other factors such as water conditions or growth of
marine organisms. Yet it remains a major obstacle and a much less studied one,
partly due to the lack of data. This paper presents a new deep-sea dataset to
benchmark underwater long-term visual localization. The dataset is composed of
images from four visits to the same hydrothermal vent edifice over the course
of five years. Camera poses and a common geometry of the scene were estimated
using navigation data and Structure-from-Motion. This serves as a reference
when evaluating visual localization techniques. An analysis of the data
provides insights about the major changes observed throughout the years.
Furthermore, several well-established visual localization methods are evaluated
on the dataset, showing there is still room for improvement in underwater
long-term visual localization. The data is made publicly available at

measured reaction rate was found to monotonously increase up to a value of (6.6

trajectory simulations were carried out on a previously validated,
full-dimensional potential energy surface (PES). However, around 50 K the
computed rates decreased which required re-evaluation of the reactive PES in
the long-range part due to a small spurious barrier with height 40 K in the
entrance channel. By exploring different correction schemes the measured
thermal rates can be adequately reproduced, displaying a clear negative
temperature dependence over the entire temperature range. The possible
astrochemical implications of an increased reaction rate at low temperature are
also discussed.

applications has sparked the interest for the development of energy dissipating
systems, such as damping devices or shock absorbers. The Rheinforce technology
allows to design customized energy dissipative composites by embedding
microfluidic channels filled with STFs in a scaffold material. One of the
reasons for using microfluidic channels is that their shape can be numerically
optimized to control pressure drop (also known as rectifiers); thus, by
controlling the pressure drop, it is possible the control the energy dissipated
by the viscous effect. Upon impact, the fluid is forced to flow through the
microchannel and experiences the typical entry flow until it reaches the fully
developed flow. It is well-known for Newtonian fluid that the entrance flow is
responsible for an important percentage of the pressure drop in the fluid. This
analysis has been numerically performed before for shear thickening fluids
modelled by a Power-Law model. However, as this constitutive model represents a
continuously growing viscosity between end-viscosity plateau values, it is not
representative of the characteristic viscosity curve of shear thickening
fluids, which typically exhibit a three-regions shape
(thinning-thickening-thinning). This work analyzes for the very first time the
influence of these three regions on the entry flow on a pipe. 2D numerical
simulations have been performed for four STFs consisting of four dispersions of
fumed silica nanoparticles in polypropylene glycol varying concentration
(7.5-20wt%) modelled by Khandavalli, et al.[1]. The simulations were carried
out for low generalized Reynolds numbers, corresponding to the shear thickening

Weakly supervised approaches often use image subsections or tiles as input,

to each tile. However, this method overlooks the potential for false
positives/negatives because tumors can be heterogeneous, with cancer and normal
cells growing in patterns larger than a single tile. Such errors at the tile
level could lead to misclassification at the tumor level. To address this
limitation, we developed a novel deep learning pooling operator called CHARM
(Contrastive Histopathology Attention Resolved Models). CHARM leverages the
dependencies among single tiles within a WSI and imposes contextual constraints
as prior knowledge to multiple instance learning models. We tested CHARM on the

into finite particles, i.e., particles characterized by a fixed spatial profile
of finite width, each carrying a fixed amount of mass. The motion of the
particles is then governed by a competition between the cost of transport, that
aims to keep the particles fixed, and entropy maximization, that aims to spread
the particles so as to increase the entropy of the system. We show how the

of the governing incremental functional. Using this variational principle, we
derive optimal scaling relations between the width of the particles, their

minimize the approximation error on the weights. Recent work assumes the

little research has systematically evaluated which approximation errors can be
used to make choices regarding the layer, tensor decomposition method, and
level of compression. To close this gap, we perform an experimental study to
test if this assumption holds across different layers and types of
decompositions, and what the effect of fine-tuning is. We include the
approximation error on the features resulting from a compressed layer in our
analysis to test if this provides a better proxy, as it explicitly takes the
data into account. We find the approximation error on the weights has a
positive correlation with the performance error, before as well as after
fine-tuning. Basing the approximation error on the features does not improve
the correlation significantly. While scaling the approximation error commonly
is used to account for the different sizes of layers, the average correlation
across layers is smaller than across all choices (i.e. layers, decompositions,
and level of compression) before fine-tuning. When calculating the correlation
across the different decompositions, the average rank correlation is larger
than across all choices. This means multiple decompositions can be considered
for compression and the approximation error can be used to choose between them.

calculation as a joint process of foreground control point regression and
content-based attention score estimation, which is computed by a dedicated
designed gated-attention block. TPS++ builds a more flexible content-aware
rectifier, generating a natural text correction that is easier to read by the
subsequent recognizer. Moreover, TPS++ shares the feature backbone with the
recognizer in part and implements the rectification at feature-level rather
than image-level, incurring only a small overhead in terms of parameters and
inference time. Experiments on public benchmarks show that TPS++ consistently
improves the recognition and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Meanwhile, it

which in turn lead to the EE transport and degrade the plasma energy
confinement. In this work, we propose a global fluid-kinetic hybrid model for
studying corresponding kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes by coupling
the drift-kinetic EEs to the Landau-fluid model of bulk plasmas in a
non-perturbative manner. The numerical capability of Landau-fluid bulk plasmas
is obtained based on a well-benchmarked eigenvalue code MAS [Multiscale
Analysis of plasma Stabilities, J. Bao et al. Nucl. Fusion accepted 2023], and
the EE responses to the electromagnetic fluctuations are analytically derived,
which not only contribute to the MHD interchange drive and parallel current but
also lead to the newly kinetic particle compression with the precessional drift
resonance in the leading order. The hybrid model is casted into a nonlinear
eigenvalue matrix equation and solved iteratively using Newton's method. By
calibrating the EE precession frequency against the particle equation of motion
in general geometry and applying more realistic trapped particle distribution
in the poloidal plane, MAS simulations of EE-driven beta-induced Alfven
eigenmodes (e-BAE) show excellent agreements with gyrokinetic particle-in-cell
simulations, and the non-perturbative effects of EEs on e-BAE mode structure,
growth rate and damping rate are demonstrated. With these efforts, the upgraded
MAS greatly improves the computation efficiency for plasma problems related to
deeply-trapped EEs, which is superior than initial-value simulations restricted
by the stringent electron Courant condition regarding to the practical
application of fast linear analysis.

an intriguing and challenging platform for probing ergodicity breaking in
vibrational energy transport, particularly in the context of controlling
chemical reactions. Here, we report the observation of rotational ergodicity
breaking in an unprecedentedly large and symmetric molecule, 12C60. This is
facilitated by the first ever observation of icosahedral ro-vibrational fine
structure in any physical system, first predicted for 12C60 in 1986. The
ergodicity breaking exhibits several surprising features: first, there are
multiple transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic regimes as the total
angular momentum is increased, and second, they occur well below the
traditional vibrational ergodicity threshold. These peculiar dynamics result
from the molecules' unique combination of symmetry, size, and rigidity,
highlighting the potential of fullerenes to uncover emergent phenomena in
mesoscopic quantum systems.

neatly to the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, which allows us to extract
a general dynamical principle for metastability: the coexistence of attracting

dissipate enough energy for ""circularization"". Instead, the bound debris forms
an extended eccentric accretion flow with eccentricity $\simeq 0.4-0.5$ by
$\sim 2$ fallback times. Although the energy dissipated in shocks in this
large-scale flow is much smaller than the ""circularization"" energy, it matches
the observed radiated energy very well. Nonetheless, the impact of shocks is

finding cosmological models that undergo a transition from a decelerating epoch
into an accelerated one without the need of an exotic fluid with negative
pressure. More specifically, we study two classes of models of the
geometry-matter coupling in this theory, namely, in the first case, we consider
an addition of an $R$-term with a $T$-term, and in the second case, we analyse
a stronger coupling that allows for the appearance of crossed $RT$ terms. Our
results indicate that both models feature a significant region of their phase
space corresponding to cosmological models with accelerated expansion, and
several trajectories in the phase space can evolve into this region from a
decelerated phase. In particular, we verify that the first of these
geometry-matter couplings successfully models the cosmological evolution
towards a de-Sitter behaviour, without the necessity of recurring to a
cosmological constant. A general feature of these theories with geometry-matter
couplings is the non-conservation of the stress-energy tensor. However, in the
first approach in our analysis, we have imposed $\nabla^{\mu} T_{\mu\nu}=0$,
which is helpful as an additional constraint to solve the system of dynamical
equations. Then, in a second approach, we briefly explore the general case
$\nabla^{\mu} T_{\mu\nu} \neq 0$, finding that the second class of models with
stronger matter-geometry coupling also becomes adequate to model a transition

the complementary multi-phase information for liver tumor segmentation (LiTS),
which are crucial to assist the diagnosis of liver cancer clinically. However,
the performances of existing multi-phase liver tumor segmentation
(MPLiTS)-based methods suffer from redundancy and weak interpretability, % of
the fused result, resulting in the implicit unreliability of clinical
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel trustworthy multi-phase liver
tumor segmentation (TMPLiTS), which is a unified framework jointly conducting
segmentation and uncertainty estimation. The trustworthy results could assist
the clinicians to make a reliable diagnosis. Specifically, Dempster-Shafer
Evidence Theory (DST) is introduced to parameterize the segmentation and
uncertainty as evidence following Dirichlet distribution. The reliability of
segmentation results among multi-phase CECT images is quantified explicitly.
Meanwhile, a multi-expert mixture scheme (MEMS) is proposed to fuse the
multi-phase evidences, which can guarantee the effect of fusion procedure based
on theoretical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
TMPLiTS compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, the robustness
of TMPLiTS is verified, where the reliable performance can be guaranteed
against the perturbations.

particle transport model that includes both pitch-angle and perpendicular
spatial diffusion, we simulate, amongst other quantities, the onset delay for
MeV electrons and protons and compare the results to observations of SEPs from
widely-separated spacecraft. Such observations have previously been
interpreted, in a simple scenario assuming no perpendicular diffusion, as
evidence for different electron and proton sources. We show that, by assuming a
common particle source together with perpendicular diffusion, we are able to
simultaneously reproduce the onset delays for both electrons and protons. We
argue that this points towards a common accelerator for these particles.
Moreover, a relatively broad particle source is required in the model to
correctly describe the observations. This is suggestive of diffusive shock
acceleration occurring at large shock structures playing a significant role in
the acceleration of these SEPs.

safe actions by introducing an uncertainty-aware distance-based safety filter;
and (2) the ability to compensate for incomplete intraoperative anatomical
information, by encoding a-priori knowledge about anatomical structures with a

assessed by quantitative comparison with the gold standard (GS) drill planning.
In experiments with 5 models derived from real magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

the advection equation in problems with large bulk velocity on arbitrary
computational grids. In comparison with standard up-wind algorithms, RAM
enables advection with larger time steps and lower truncation errors. Our
method is based on the operator splitting technique and conservative
interpolation. Depending on the bulk velocity and resolution, RAM can decrease
the numerical cost of hydrodynamics by more than one order of magnitude. To
quantify the truncation errors and speed-up with RAM, we perform one and
two-dimensional hydrodynamics tests. We find that the order of our method is
given by the order of the conservative interpolation and that the effective
speed up is in agreement with the relative increment in time step. RAM will be
especially useful for numerical studies of disk-satellite interaction,
characterized by high bulk orbital velocities, and non-trivial geometries. Our
method dramatically lowers the computational cost of simulations that
simultaneously resolve the global disk and well inside the Hill radius of the

based on their observed ratios. We find HE0232-3755 to be a likely main
r-process star, and HE2214-6127 and HE2332-3039 to be limited-r stars.
CS30302-145, HE2045-5057, and CD-24 17504 plausibly originated in
long-disrupted early dwarf galaxies as evidenced by their [Sr/Ba] and [Ba/Fe]
ratios. We also find that the derived [Sr/H] and [Ba/H] values for CD-24 17504
are not inconsistent with the predicted yields of the s-process in massive
rotating low-metallicity stars models. Further theoretical explorations will be
helpful to better understand the earliest mechanisms and time scales of heavy
element production for comparison with these and other observational abundance
data. Finally, we investigate the orbital histories of our sample stars. Most
display halo-like kinematics although three stars (CS29504-018, HE0223-2814,
and HE2133-0421) appear to be disk-like in nature. This confirms the
extragalactic origin for CS30302-145, HE2045-5057, and, in particular, CD-24
17504 which likely originated from a small accreted stellar system as one of
the oldest stars.

Milky Way. In this work we report the measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays
from the Galactic plane between 10 TeV and 1 PeV energies, with the square
kilometer array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO).
Diffuse emissions from the inner ($15^{\circ}<l<125^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$)
and outer ($125^{\circ}<l<235^{\circ}$, $|b|<5^{\circ}$) Galactic plane are
detected with $29.1\sigma$ and $12.7\sigma$ significance, respectively. The
outer Galactic plane diffuse emission is detected for the first time in the
very- to ultra-high-energy domain ($E>10$~TeV). The energy spectrum in the
inner Galaxy regions can be described by a power-law function with an index of
$-2.99\pm0.04$, which is different from the curved spectrum as expected from
hadronic interactions between locally measured cosmic rays and the
line-of-sight integrated gas content. Furthermore, the measured flux is higher
by a factor of $\sim3$ than the prediction. A similar spectrum with an index of
$-2.99\pm0.07$ is found in the outer Galaxy region, and the absolute flux for
$10\lesssim E\lesssim60$ TeV is again higher than the prediction for hadronic
cosmic ray interactions. The latitude distributions of the diffuse emission are
consistent with the gas distribution, while the longitude distributions show
slight deviation from the gas distribution. The LHAASO measurements imply that
either additional emission sources exist or cosmic ray intensities have spatial
variations.

accurately converting RF signals into meaningful visual information and
overcoming the challenges of RF signals in complex environments, such as
multipath interference, signal attenuation, and noise. To tackle this problem,
we propose Trans-Inpainter, a novel image inpainting method that utilizes the
Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals in combination with transformer
networks to generate high-quality reconstructed images. This approach is the
first to use CSI for image inpainting, which allows for extracting visual
information from WiFi signals to fill in missing regions in images. To further
improve Trans-Inpainter's performance, we investigate the impact of variations
in CSI data on RF-based imaging ability, i.e., analyzing how the location of
the CSI sensors, the combination of CSI from different sensors, and changes in

further complicated by the existence of selection biases. Appealing
uncritically to some version of the ``Principle of Mediocrity'' -- namely, the
supposed typicality of what transpired on Earth -- is problematic on empirical
or logical grounds. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian statistical approach to
put on rigorous footing the inference of lower bounds for the probability of
abiogenesis, based on current and future evidence. We demonstrate that the
single datum that life has appeared at least once on Earth merely sets weak
constraints on the minimal probability of abiogenesis. In fact, the {\it a

agnostic prior) exerts the strongest influence on the final result. We also
show that the existence of a large number of habitable worlds does not
necessarily imply, by itself, a high probability that life should be common in
the universe. Instead, as delineated before, the choice of prior, which is
subject to uncertainty (i.e., admits multiple scenarios), strongly influences
the likelihood of life being common. If habitable worlds are uncommon, for an
agnostic prior, a deterministic scenario for the origin of life might be
favoured over one where abiogenesis is a fluke event.

characterization of how topological effects govern the complexity of a

work, we show how topology and complexity are directly intertwined concepts in
the context of classical statistical mechanics. In concrete, we present a
theory that shows how the \emph{Kolmogorov complexity} of a classical partition
function sampling carries unique, distinctive features depending on the
presence of topological excitations in the system. We confront two-dimensional
Ising and XY models on several topologies, and study the corresponding
samplings as high-dimensional manifolds in configuration space, quantifying
their complexity via the intrinsic dimension. While for the Ising model the
intrisic dimension is independent of the real-space topology, for the XY model
it depends crucially on temperature: across the
Berezkinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, complexity becomes topology
dependent. In the BKT phase, it displays a characteristic dependence on the
homology of the real-space manifold, and, for $g$-torii, it follows a scaling
that is solely genus dependent. We argue that this behavior is intimately
connected to the emergence of an order parameter in data space, the conditional
connectivity, that displays scaling behavior. Our approach paves the way for an
understanding of topological phenomena from the Kolmogorov complexity

maximizing the total revenue generated by all buyers. Each customer buys a path
as long as its cost does not exceed her individual budget. In this case, the
revenue generated by her equals the sum of prices of edges along this path. We
consider the unlimited supply setting, where each edge can be sold to
arbitrarily many customers. The problem is to find a price assignment which
maximizes vendor's revenue. A special case in which the network is a tree is
known under the name of the tollbooth problem. Gamzu and Segev proposed a

we develop a model-independent theoretical framework to address this issue. We
show how to quantify fitness landscape, survivor bias and selection for
arbitrary cell traits from cell lineage statistics in the presence of death,
and we test this method using an experimental data set in which a cell
population is exposed to a drug that kills a large fraction of the population.
This analysis reveals that failing to properly account for dead lineages can
lead to misleading fitness estimations. For simple trait dynamics, we prove and
illustrate numerically that the fitness landscape and the survivor bias can in
addition be used for the non-parametric estimation of the division and death
rates, using only lineage histories. Our framework provides universal bounds on
the population growth rate, and a fluctuation-response relation which
quantifies the reduction of population growth rate due to the variability in
death rate. Further, in the context of cell size control, we obtain
generalizations of Powell's relation that link the distributions of generation
times with the population growth rate, and show that the survivor bias can
sometimes conceal the adder property, namely the constant increment of volume

similarities with acoustic phonon modes, but they are not protected by any
exact translational symmetry. As a consequence, they are subject to a
wavevector independent damping, and they develop a finite pinning frequency,
which destroy their acoustic linearly propagating dispersion. Under a few and
simple well-motivated assumptions, we compute the phason density of states, and
we derive the phason heat capacity as a function of the temperature. Finally,
imagining a hypothetical s-wave pairing channel with electrons, we compute the

the unique regular structure of modular XL-array, termed sub-array based
uniform spherical wave (USW) models with different or common angles,
respectively. Based on the developed models, the near-field beam focusing

to the existing collocated XL-array with the same number of array elements,
modular XL-array can significantly enhance the spatial resolution, but at the
cost of generating undesired grating lobes. Fortunately, different from the
conventional far-field uniform plane wave (UPW) model, the near-field USW model
for modular XL-array exhibits a higher grating lobe suppression capability,
thanks to the non-linear phase variations across the array elements. Finally,
simulation results are provided to verify the near-field beam focusing pattern

well understood both experimentally and theoretically. Indeed, besides deuteron
and triton, all known hydrogen isotopes are resonances of complex structure.
Even more elusive is 7H, which may have been observed experimentally and has
been claimed to be a narrow resonance. Nevertheless, even its existence is
controversial, and its theoretical study is difficult due to both its unbound
character and large number of interacting valence nucleons. It is then the
object of this paper to theoretically study the hydrogen isotopes {4-7}H with
the Gamow shell model, which is, up to our knowledge, the first direct
calculation of unbound resonance hydrogen isotopes up to 7H. As the Gamow shell
model includes both continuum coupling and inter-nucleon correlations, useful
information can be obtained about poorly known unbound hydrogen isotopes. Our
present calculations indicate that {4,6}H ground states are fairly broad
resonances, whereas those of {5,7}H are narrow, which is in accordance with
current experimental data. The results then suggest that, in particular, {5,7}H
should be more heavily studied, as they might well be among the most narrow
neutron resonances of the light nuclear chart.

updated maps. To better sense areas with complex geometry (urban areas in
particular), considering 3D data appears to be an interesting alternative to
classical 2D images. In this context, 3D point clouds (PCs) obtained by LiDAR
or photogrammetry are very interesting. While recent studies showed the
considerable benefit of using deep learning-based methods to detect and
characterize changes into raw 3D PCs, these studies rely on large annotated
training data to obtain accurate results. The collection of these annotations
are tricky and time-consuming. The availability of unsupervised or weakly
supervised approaches is then of prime interest. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised method, called DeepCluster 3D Change Detection (DC3DCD), to detect
and categorize multiclass changes at point level. We classify our approach in
the unsupervised family given the fact that we extract in a completely
unsupervised way a number of clusters associated with potential changes. Let us
precise that in the end of the process, the user has only to assign a label to
each of these clusters to derive the final change map. Our method builds upon
the DeepCluster approach, originally designed for image classification, to
handle complex raw 3D PCs and perform change segmentation task. An assessment
of the method on both simulated and real public dataset is provided. The
proposed method allows to outperform fully-supervised traditional machine
learning algorithm and to be competitive with fully-supervised deep learning

ultimate goal is to build systems which can meaningfully interact with their

of Lexical Semantics, humans organize the meaning of words in hierarchies where
the meaning of, e.g., a noun, is defined in terms of the meaning of a more
general noun, its genus, and of one or more differentiating properties, its
differentia. The main tenet of this paper is that object recognition should
implement a hierarchical process which follows the hierarchical semantic
structure used to define the meaning of words. We achieve this goal by
implementing an algorithm which, for any object, recursively recognizes its
visual genus and its visual differentia. In other words, the recognition of an
object is decomposed in a sequence of steps where the locally relevant visual
features are recognized. This paper presents the algorithm and a first

high computational cost. To tackle these issues, a 3D deep learning scheme,

C-scans. The proposed scheme leverages a prior 3D convolutional neural network
with a feature attention mechanism to suppress the noise in the C-scans due to
subsurface heterogeneous soil environments. Then a 3D U-shaped encoder-decoder
network with multi-scale feature aggregation modules is designed to establish
the optimal inverse mapping from the denoised C-scans to 3D permittivity maps.
Furthermore, a three-step separate learning strategy is employed to pre-train
and fine-tune the networks. The proposed scheme is applied to numerical
simulation as well as real measurement data. The quantitative and qualitative
results show the network capability, generalizability, and robustness in

assistance of an integrated loss function that helps minimize the difference
between the actual states and the retrieved states. Then, we systematically
trace different impacts within a bag of common training strategies involving
various parameter adjustments on the attention-based QST method. Combining
these techniques, we establish a robust baseline that can efficiently
reconstruct pure and mixed quantum states. Furthermore, by comparing the
performance of three popular neural network architectures (FCNs, CNNs, and
Transformer), we demonstrate the remarkable expressiveness of attention in
learning density matrices from measured statistics.

regularization refers to the hidden preference of a particular optimization
method towards a certain interpolating solution among the many. A by now
established line of work has shown that (stochastic) gradient descent tends to
have an implicit bias towards low rank and/or sparse solutions when used to
train deep linear networks, explaining to some extent why overparameterized
neural network models trained by gradient descent tend to have good
generalization performance in practice. However, existing theory for
square-loss objectives often requires very small initialization of the
trainable weights, which is at odds with the larger scale at which weights are
initialized in practice for faster convergence and better generalization
performance. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by incorporating and
analyzing gradient descent with weight normalization, where the weight vector
is reparamterized in terms of polar coordinates, and gradient descent is
applied to the polar coordinates. By analyzing key invariants of the gradient
flow and using Lojasiewicz's Theorem, we show that weight normalization also
has an implicit bias towards sparse solutions in the diagonal linear model, but
that in contrast to plain gradient descent, weight normalization enables a
robust bias that persists even if the weights are initialized at practically
large scale. Experiments suggest that the gains in both convergence speed and
robustness of the implicit bias are improved dramatically by using weight
normalization in overparameterized diagonal linear network models.

in aqueous habitats. For assessing the influence on the ecosystem and possible
solution strategies, it is necessary to investigate the fate of microplastics
(MP) in the environment. MPs are typically surrounded by natural organic
matter, which can cause them to aggregate. However, the effect of MP shape and
flow conditions on this heteroaggregation is not well understood. To address
this gap, we perform simulations of heteroaggregation of different MP shapes
with smaller spherical organic matter. We demonstrate that the shape had a
strong impact on the aggregate structure. MPs with mostly smooth surfaces
formed compact structures with a large number of neighbors with weak connection
strength and a higher fractal dimension. MPs with edges and corners aggregated
into more fractal structures with fewer neighbors, but with stronger
connections. Using MPCD, we investigated aggregates under shear flow. The
critical shear rate at which the aggregates break up is much larger for
spherical and rounded cube MPs, i.e, the compact aggregate structure of spheres
outweighs their weaker connection strength. Most notably, the rounded cube
exhibited unexpectedly high resistance against breakup under shear. We
attribute this to being fairly compact due to weaker, flexible neighbor
connections, which are still strong enough to prevent particles to break off
during shear flow. Irrespective of the stronger connections between
neighbouring MPs, the fractal aggregates of cubes break up at lower shear
rates. We find that cube aggregates reduced their radius of gyration
significantly, indicating restructuring, while most neighbor connections were
kept intact. Aggregates of spheres, however, kept their overall size while
undergoing local rearrangements, that broke a significant portion of their
neighbor interactions.

Argentine Institute for Radioastronomy (IAR) and the Rochester Institute of
Technology (RIT) that since 2017 has been observing southern sky pulsars with
high cadence using the two restored IAR antennas in the L-Band (1400MHz). We
briefly review the first set of results of this program to study transient
phenomena, such as magnetars and glitching pulsars, as well as to perform
precise timing of millisecond pulsars. Access to lower frequency bands, where
most of the pulsars are brighter, would allow us to reach additional pulsars,
currently buried into the background noise. We identify two dozen additional
glitching pulsars that could be observable in the 400MHz band by the IAR's
projected Multipurpose Interferometer Array (MIA). We also discuss the
relevance and challenges of single-pulse pulsar timing at low frequencies and
the search for Fast Radio Burst (FRB) in the collected data since 2017 using
machine learning techniques.

that output contextualised representations at the character level. Many such
modelling architectures and methods to train those architectures have been
proposed, but it is currently unclear what the relative contributions of the
architecture vs. the pretraining objective are to final model performance. We
explore the design space of such models, comparing architectural innovations
and a variety of different pretraining objectives on a suite of evaluation
tasks with a fixed training procedure in order to find the currently optimal
way to build and train character-level BERT-like models. We find that our best
performing character-level model exceeds the performance of a token-based model
trained with the same settings on the same data, suggesting that
character-level models are ready for more widespread adoption. Unfortunately,
the best method to train character-level models still relies on a subword-level
tokeniser during pretraining, and final model performance is highly dependent
on tokeniser quality. We believe our results demonstrate the readiness of
character-level models for multilingual language representation, and encourage
NLP practitioners to try them as drop-in replacements for token-based models.

learning, SENs are expected to become a critical component of future wireless
networks. In particular, integrated vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet)
architectures, which enable dynamic, three-dimensional (3D), and agile
topologies, are likely to form a key foundation for SENs. However, the
distributed multi-level computational and communication structure and the fully
dynamic nature of self-evolving integrated VHetNets (SEI-VHetNets) necessitate
the deployment of an enhanced distributed learning and computing mechanism to
enable full integration and coordination. To address this need, we propose a
novel learning technique, multi-tier hierarchical federated learning (MT-HFL),
based on hierarchical federated learning (HFL) that enables full integration
and coordination across vertical tiers. Through MT-HFL, SEI-VHetNets can learn
and adapt to dynamic network conditions, optimize resource allocation, and
enhance user experience in a real-time, scalable, and accurate manner while

angular momentum (OAM), which is inherit in the transverse spatial mode of
photons, offers a natural carrier to encode information in high-dimensional

transformations on the photonic OAM states. Here, by combining the path and OAM
degrees of freedom of a single photon, an efficient scheme to realize arbitrary

proposal reduces the number of required interferometers by approximately one
quarter compared with previous works, while maintaining the symmetric

can result in new forms of collective behaviour. Here, we study a mixture of
active species which catalyze the conversion of a substrate chemical into a
product chemical, and chemotax in concentration gradients of both substrate and

coarse-grain into attractive and repulsive, which can lead to a potentially
complex interaction network. We consider the particular case of a metabolic
cycle of three species, each of which interacts with itself and both other
species in the cycle. We find that the stability of a cycle of species that
only chemotax in gradients of their substrate is piloted by a set of two
parameter-free conditions, which we use to classify the low number of

product-chemotactic species, we can derive a set of two high-dimensional

In this paper, we propose an adaptive variant of the SHBM method for solving
stochastic problems that are reformulated from linear systems using
user-defined distributions. Our adaptive SHBM (ASHBM) method utilizes iterative
information to update the parameters, addressing an open problem in the
literature regarding the adaptive learning of momentum parameters. We prove
that our method converges linearly in expectation, with a better convergence
rate compared to the basic method. Notably, we demonstrate that the
deterministic version of our ASHBM algorithm can be reformulated as a variant
of the conjugate gradient (CG) method, inheriting many of its appealing
properties, such as finite-time convergence. Consequently, the ASHBM method can
be further generalized to develop a brand-new framework of the stochastic CG

leveraging recent optimization advances for deep neural networks (DNNs) that

the proposed algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art DRL algorithms,

  Every estimable property is also testable, since testing corresponds to

testing, the Fischer--Newman theorem, gives an inverse statement: every

brightness, modulated by the gains of the individual radio antennas. Due to
atmospheric turbulence and variations in the operational conditions of the
antennas these gains fluctuate. Thereby the gains do not only depend on time
but also on the spatial direction on the sky. To recover high quality radio
maps an accurate reconstruction of the direction and time-dependent individual
antenna gains is required. Aims: This paper aims to improve the reconstruction
of radio images, by introducing a novel joint imaging and calibration algorithm
including direction-dependent antenna gains. Methods: Building on the
\texttt{resolve} framework, we designed a Bayesian imaging and calibration
algorithm utilizing the image domain gridding method for numerically efficient
application of direction-dependent antenna gains. Furthermore by approximating
the posterior probability distribution with variational inference, our
algorithm can provide reliable uncertainty maps. Results: We demonstrate the
ability of the algorithm to recover high resolution high dynamic range radio

recovered images with previous work relying on classically calibrated data.
Furthermore we compare with a compressed sensing algorithm also incorporating
direction-dependent gains. Conclusions: Including direction-dependent effects
in the calibration model significantly improves the dynamic range of the
reconstructed images compared to reconstructions from classically calibrated

Importantly, a significant fraction of all gate errors result in decays out of
the qubit subspace, to the ground state. By performing fast, mid-circuit
detection of these errors, we convert them into erasure errors; during
detection, the induced error probability on qubits remaining in the
computational space is less than $10^{-5}$. This work establishes metastable

One of them uses the thermal bath to prepare the initial Gibbs state; then,
after quenching, the thermal bath is removed and the dynamics of the system is
unitary. Wealso address a more complex QQ protocol where the thermal bath is
not removed after quenching, thus the quantum evolution is also driven by the

further scaling variables proportional to the temperature and the decay rate

0.005 mm/year. Sea level along Ontario's Hudson Bay coast is decreasing due to
isostatic rebound of the land following the last Ice Age. The change to ocean
acidity due to CO2 absorption from the atmosphere is negligible compared to
that due to tides, ocean depth and seasonal effects. Ontario's contribution to
ocean acidification is estimated to be 6 x 10^{-6} pH/year. No changes in
precipitation in North America over the 19th and 20th centuries, nor at Toronto
since 1843, were found. The Great Lake levels are remarkably constant over the

evidence was found that the frequency of extreme events such as hurricanes or
tornadoes increased during recent decades. The number of forest fires in Canada
and Ontario decreased during 1990 to 2020.

achieved state-of-the-art performance and have been widely used by developers
during software development. However, the security issue, e.g., recommending
vulnerable code, has not received sufficient attention, which will bring
potential harm to software development. Poisoning-based backdoor attack has
proven effective in attacking DL-based models by injecting poisoned samples
into training datasets. However, previous work shows that the attack technique
does not perform successfully on all DL-based code search models and tends to
fail for Transformer-based models, especially pretrained models. Besides, the
infected models generally perform worse than benign models, which makes the
attack not stealthy enough and thereby hinders the adoption by developers. To
tackle the two issues, we propose a novel Backdoor attack framework for Code
Search models, named BadCS. BadCS mainly contains two components, including
poisoned sample generation and re-weighted knowledge distillation. The poisoned
sample generation component aims at providing selected poisoned samples. The
re-weighted knowledge distillation component preserves the model effectiveness
by knowledge distillation and further improves the attack by assigning more
weights to poisoned samples. Experiments on four popular DL-based models and
two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the existing code search systems are
easily attacked by BadCS. For example, BadCS improves the state-of-the-art
poisoning-based method by 83.03%-99.98% and 75.98%-99.90% on Python and Java
datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, BadCS also achieves a relatively better
performance than benign models, increasing the baseline models by 0.49% and

due to difficulties in assessing the SFR from observed quantities and probing
the SFRF over a wide range of SFRs. We overcome these limitations thanks to an

redundancies in the network. In this work, we propose a novel recursion-based
framework to enhance the efficiency of deep unfolding models. First, recursions

Secondly, we randomize the number of recursions during training to decrease the

different temporal scales lead to better understanding of a wide variety of
phenomena including stellar atmospheres and dynamos, convective motions, and
rotational periods. Here, we investigate the variability of solar Balmer lines
(H-$\alpha$, -$\beta$, -$\gamma$, -$\delta$) observed by space-borne
radiometers (OSIRIS, SCIAMACHY, OMI, and GOME-2), combining these precise,
long-term observations with high-resolution data from the ground-based NSO/ISS
spectrograph. We relate the detected variability to the appearance of magnetic
features on the solar disk. We find that on solar-rotational timescales (about
1 month), the Balmer line activity indices (defined as line-core to line-wing
ratios) closely follow variations in the total solar irradiance (which is
predominantly photospheric), thus frequently (specifically, during passages of
sunspot groups) deviating from behavior of activity indices that track
chromospheric activity levels. On longer timescales, the correlation with
chromospheric indices increases, with periods of low- or even anti-correlation
found at intermediate timescales. Comparison of these observations with
estimates from semi-empirical irradiance reconstructions helps quantify the
contributions of different magnetic and quiet features. We conclude that both
the lower sensitivity to network and in part the higher sensitivity to
filaments and prominences, may result in complex, time-dependent relationships
between Balmer and other chromospheric indices observed for the Sun and
solar-like stars. The fact that core and wings contribute in similar manner to
the variability, and current knowledge of Balmer-lines formation in stellar
atmospheres, support the notion that Balmer lines core-to-wing ratios indices
behave more like photospheric rather than chromospheric indices.

are non-minimally coupled scalar theories which yield a viable inflationary
phenomenology in both Jordan and Einstein frames. By considering the
constraints from inflationary theories, which basically determine the values of
the potential strength, usually considered as a free parameter in astrophysical
neutron star works, we construct and solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations using a solid python-3 LSODA integrator. For our study we consider
several popular inflationary models, such as the universal attractors, the
$R^p$ attractors (three distinct model values), the induced inflation, the
quadratic inflation, the Higgs inflation and the $a$-attractors (two distinct
model values) and for the following popular equations of state the WFF1, the
SLy, the APR, the MS1, the AP3, the AP4, the ENG, the MPA1 and the MS1b. We
construct the $M-R$ diagram and we confront the resulting theory with
theoretical and observational constraints. As we demonstrate, remarkably, all
the neutron stars produced by all the inflationary models we considered are
compatible with all the constraints for the MPA1 equation of state. It is
notable that for this particular equation of state, the maximum masses of the
neutron stars are in the mass-gap region with $M>2.5M_{\odot}$, but lower than
the 3 solar masses causal limit. We also make the observation that as the NICER
constraints are pushed towards larger radii, as for example in the case of the
black widow pulsar PSR J0952-0607, it seems that equations of state that
produce neutron stars with maximum masses in the mass gap region, with
$M>2.5M_{\odot}$, but lower than the 3 solar masses causal limit, are favored

with machine learning notably starting to see more applications across a varied
range of fields. One specific machine learning application that is of interest
to us is that of software safety and security, especially in the context of
parallel programs. The issue of being able to detect concurrency bugs
automatically has intrigued programmers for a long time, as the added layer of
complexity makes concurrent programs more prone to failure. The development of
such automatic detection tools provides considerable benefits to programmers in
terms of saving time while debugging, as well as reducing the number of
unexpected bugs. We believe machine learning may help achieve this goal by
providing additional advantages over current approaches, in terms of both
overall tool accuracy as well as programming language flexibility. However, due
to the presence of numerous challenges specific to the machine learning
approach (correctly labelling a sufficiently large dataset, finding the best
model types/architectures and so forth), we have to approach each issue of
developing such a tool separately. Therefore, the focus of this project is on
comparing both common and recent machine learning approaches. We abstract away
the complexity of procuring a labelled dataset of concurrent programs under the
form of a synthetic dataset that we define and generate with the scope of
simulating real-life (concurrent) programs. We formulate hypotheses about
fundamental limits of various machine learning model types which we then
validate by running extensive tests on our synthetic dataset. We hope that our
findings provide more insight in the advantages and disadvantages of various
model types when modelling programs using machine learning, as well as any

input is encoded spatially first, frame-by-frame, combining features encoding
holistic aspects of the subjects' facial expressions and features encoding
spatially localized aspects of their expressions. Input is then combined across
time: from frame-to-frame using gated recurrent units (GRUs), then globally by
a transformer. We handle variable video length with a regression token that
accumulates information from all frames into a fixed-dimensional vector
independent of video length. Audio information is handled similarly: spectral
information extracted within each frame is integrated across time by a cascade
of GRUs and a transformer with regression token. The video and audio regression
tokens' outputs are merged by concatenation, then input to a final fully
connected layer producing intensity estimates. Our architecture achieved
excellent performance on the Hume-Reaction dataset in the ERI Esimation

self-reported scores, averaged across all emotions, were 0.455 on the
validation dataset and 0.4547 on the test dataset, well above the baselines.

the most critical video frames regardless of length. Ablation experiments
establish the advantages of combining holistic/local features and of
multi-modal integration. Code available at https://github.com/HKUST-NISL/ABAW5.

construction of representations of the Heisenberg algebra and of modified
enveloping algebras of Kac-Moody algebras. In its most basic form, convolution
between two quiver varieties is given by pullback and then pushforward via the
Hecke correspondence for quivers.
  In previous work we showed that the Hecke correspondence has a
Morse-theoretic interpretation in terms of spaces of flow lines. The goal of
this paper is to show that the topological information that defines generators
for Nakajima's representations can be encoded in the cup product for a Morse
complex defined on the smooth space of representations of a quiver without
relations, and then pulling back to the subvariety of representations that do
satisfy a given set of relations. The results are valid for the main motivating
example of Nakajima quivers, as well as other quivers with relations derived
from these (for example handsaw quivers).
  For the norm square of a moment map on the space of representations of a
quiver, the usual Morse-Bott-Smale transversality condition on the space of
flow lines fails, however a weaker version of transversality is still
satisfied. A major part of the paper is spent developing a general theory in
this setting of weak transversality from which one can recover the usual
construction of the differentials and cup product on the Morse complex by
adding an intermediate step of taking cup product with a certain Euler class,
which is explicitly computable for the space of representations of a quiver.

gastroscopies has to overcome the challenge of significant shape and
illumination changes between reobservations of the same endoluminal location.
Instead of geometrical maps that strongly rely on a fixed scene geometry,
topological maps are more adequate because they focus on visual place
recognition, i.e. the capability to determine if two video shots are imaging
the same location. We propose a topological mapping and localization system
able to operate on real human colonoscopies. The map is a graph where each node
codes a colon location by a set of real images of that location. The edges
represent traversability between two nodes. For close-in-time images, where
scene changes are minor, place recognition can be successfully managed with the
recent transformers-based image-matching algorithms. However, under long-term
changes -- such as different colonoscopies of the same patient -- feature-based
matching fails. To address this, we propose a GeM global descriptor able to
achieve high recall with significant changes in the scene. The addition of a
Bayesian filter processing the map graph boosts the accuracy of the long-term
place recognition, enabling relocalization in a previously built map. In the
experiments, we construct a map during the withdrawal phase of a first
colonoscopy. Subsequently, we prove the ability to relocalize within this map
during a second colonoscopy of the same patient two weeks later. Code and

variables are strong predictors of human behavior and social outcomes. However,
there are transient changes human behavior associated with emotions that are

which arise in direct response to a decision-making scenario, have been linked
to temporary shifts in decision-making preferences.
  In this work, we investigated the effects of moderating social preferences
with integral emotions in multi-agent societies. We developed Svoie, a method
for designing agents which make decisions based on established SVO policies, as
well as alternative integral emotion policies in response to task outcomes. We
conducted simulation experiments in a resource-sharing task environment, and
compared societies of Svoie agents with societies of agents with fixed SVO
policies. We find that societies of agents which adapt their behavior through
integral emotions achieved similar collective welfare to societies of agents
with fixed SVO policies, but with significantly reduced inequality between the
welfare of agents with different SVO traits. We observed that by allowing
agents to change their policy in response to task outcomes, agents can moderate
their behavior to achieve greater social equality. \end{abstract}

at redshift z~2, is a merger system containing a powerful radio source and
large displacements of gas. We present kpc-resolution data from ALMA and the
VLA of carbon monoxide (6-5), dust, and synchrotron continuum, combined with
Keck integral-field spectroscopy. We find that the Dragonfly consists of two
galaxies with rotating disks that are in the early phase of merging. The radio
jet originates from the northern galaxy and brightens when it hits the disk of
the southern galaxy. The Dragonfly Galaxy therefore likely appears as a
powerful radio galaxy because its flux is boosted into the regime of high-z
radio galaxies by the jet-disk interaction. We also find a molecular outflow of
(1100 $\pm$ 550) M$_{\odot}$/yr associated with the radio host galaxy, but not
with the radio hot-spot or southern galaxy, which is the galaxy that hosts the
bulk of the star formation. Gravitational effects of the merger drive a slower
and longer lived mass displacement at a rate of (170 $\pm$ 40) M$_{\odot}$/yr,
but this tidal debris contain at least as much molecular gas mass as the much
faster outflow, namely M(H2) = (3 $\pm$ 1) x 10$^9$ (alpha(CO)/0.8)
M$_{\odot}$. This suggests that both the AGN-driven outflow and mass transfer
due to tidal effects are important in the evolution of the Dragonfly system.
The Keck data show Ly$\alpha$ emission spread across 100 kpc, and CIV and HeII
emission across 35 kpc, confirming the presence of a metal-rich and extended

specifications can also be executed to reveal correct and problematic parts of
a software. Although BDD was introduced about two decades ago, there is a lack
of secondary studies in peer-reviewed scientific literature.
  Objective: To understand the current state of BDD research by conducting a
systematic mapping study that covers studies published from 2006 to 2021.
  Method: By following the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies
in software engineering, we sought to answer research questions on types of
venues in which BDD papers have been published, research, contributions,
studied topics and their evolution, and evaluation methods used in published
BDD research.
  Results: The study identified 166 papers which were mapped. Key results
include the following: the dominance of conference papers; scarcity of research
with insights from the industry; shortage of philosophical papers on BDD; acute
shortage of metrics for measuring various aspects of BDD specifications and the
processes for producing BDD specifications; the dominance of studies on using
BDD for facilitating various software development endeavours, improving the BDD
process and associated artefacts, and applying BDD in different contexts;
scarcity of studies on using BDD alongside other software techniques and
technologies; increase in diversity of studied BDD topics; and notable use of
case studies and experiments to study different BDD aspects.
  Conclusion: The paper improves our understanding of the state of the art of
BDD, and highlights important areas of focus for future BDD research.

symbolic instead of concrete inputs. This principle allows for exploring many
program paths at once. Despite its wide adoption -- in particular for program
testing -- little effort was dedicated to studying the semantic foundations of
symbolic execution. Without these foundations, critical questions regarding the
correctness of symbolic executors cannot be satisfyingly answered: Can a
reported bug be reproduced, or is it a false positive (soundness)? Can we be
sure to find all bugs if we let the testing tool run long enough
(completeness)? This paper presents a systematic approach for engineering
provably sound and complete symbolic execution-based bug finders by relating a
programming language's operational semantics with a symbolic semantics. In
contrast to prior work on symbolic execution semantics, we address the
correctness of critical implementation details of symbolic bug finders,
including the search strategy and the role of constraint solvers to prune the
search space. We showcase our approach by implementing WiSE, a prototype of a

proving it sound and complete. We demonstrate that the design principles of
WiSE survive outside the ecosystem of interactive proof assistants by (1)
automatically extracting an OCaml implementation and (2) transforming WiSE to

road safety, Driving Behavior Detection (DBD) systems have been proposed in
several studies to identify safe and unsafe driving behavior. Many of these
studies have utilized sensor data obtained from the Controller Area Network
(CAN) bus to construct their models. However, the use of publicly available
sensors is known to reduce the accuracy of detection models, while
incorporating vendor-specific sensors into the dataset increases accuracy. To
address the limitations of existing approaches, we present a reliable DBD
system based on Graph Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (GConvLSTM)
that enhances the precision and practicality of DBD models using public

model's effectiveness. Our proposed model achieved a high accuracy of 97.5\%

indicating its consistency and accuracy in both settings. To enable local
driver behavior analysis, we deployed our DBD system on a Raspberry Pi at the
network edge, with drivers able to access daily driving condition reports,
sensor data, and prediction results through a monitoring dashboard.
Furthermore, the dashboard issues voice warnings to alert drivers of hazardous

effectively detect hazardous and unsafe driving behavior, with potential
applications in improving road safety and reducing the number of accidents

with the OS and the filesystem to efficiently utilize system resources and
minimize disk I/O.
  In this paper we describe ELSAR: a parallel external sorting algorithm that
uses an innovative paradigm based on a learned data distribution model. The
algorithm leverages the model to arrange the input records into mutually
exclusive, monotonic, and equi-depth partitions that, once sorted, can simply
be concatenated to form the output. This method completely eliminates the need
for multi-way file merging, which is typically used in external sorting.
  We present thorough benchmarks for uniform and skewed datasets in various
storage media, where we measure the sorting rates, size scalability, and energy
efficiency of ELSAR and other sorting algorithms. We observed that ELSAR has up
to 1.65x higher sorting rates than the next-best external sort (Nsort) on SSD

as special cases, such as NAdam, AMSGrad, AdaBound, AdaFom, and Adan. This is
supported by a rigorous convergence analysis of UAdam in the non-convex
stochastic setting, showing that UAdam converges to the neighborhood of
stationary points with the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$. Furthermore, the size of
neighborhood decreases as $\beta$ increases. Importantly, our analysis only
requires the first-order momentum factor to be close enough to 1, without any
restrictions on the second-order momentum factor. Theoretical results also show
that vanilla Adam can converge by selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which
provides a theoretical guarantee for the analysis, applications, and further
developments of the whole class of Adam-type algorithms.

in several regions depend on the evolution of this market. However, the current
pricing system is unfair, as some actors have better market information than
others. In this context, historical pricing is an easy-to-find and affordable
data source that can help all agents to be better informed. However, the time
lag in data acquisition can affect their pricing decisions. In this paper, we
study the effect that data acquisition delay has on a price prediction system
using multiple prediction algorithms. We describe the integration of the best
proposal into a decision support system prototype and test it in a real-case
scenario. Specifically, we use public data from the most important regional
pork meat markets in Spain published by the Ministry of Agriculture with a
two-week delay and subscription-based data of the same markets obtained on the
same day. The results show that the error difference between the best public
and data subscription models is 0.6 Euro cents in favor of the data without
delay. The market dimension makes these differences significant in the supply
chain, giving pricing agents a better tool to negotiate market prices.

do this by constructing new confidence sequences (CSs) for the weighted average
of $N$ unknown values, based on samples drawn without replacement according to
a (randomized) weighted sampling scheme. Using the idea of importance weighting
to construct test martingales, we first develop a framework to construct CSs

quality of CSs by incorporating side information about the unknown values
associated with each item. We show that when the side information is
sufficiently predictive, it can directly drive the sampling. Addressing the
case where the accuracy is unknown a priori, we introduce a method that
incorporates side information via control variates. Crucially, our construction
is adaptive: if the side information is highly predictive of the unknown
misstated amounts, then the benefits of incorporating it are significant; but
if the side information is uncorrelated, our methods learn to ignore it. Our
methods recover state-of-the-art bounds for the special case when the weights
are equal, which has already found applications in election auditing. The

modeling to characterize both temporal observable and latent variable-based
dependence degrees and structures across non-normal multivariates. Our
variational neural network WPVC-VLSTM models variational sequential dependence
degrees and structures across multivariate time series by variational long
short-term memory networks and regular vine copula. The regular vine copula
models nonnormal and long-range distributional couplings across multiple
dynamic variables. WPVC-VLSTM is verified in terms of both technical
significance and portfolio forecasting performance. It outperforms benchmarks
including linear models, stochastic volatility models, deep neural networks,
and variational recurrent networks in cross-market portfolio forecasting.

frequencies in the microwave regime are beginning to incorporate Josephson
Parametric Amplifiers (JPA) as their first amplification stage. While there are
implementations for a wideband frequency response with a minimal need for
tuning, designs using resonant structures with small numbers of Josephson
elements still achieve the best noise performance. In a typical measurement
scheme involving a JPA, one needs to control the resonance frequency, pump
frequency and pump power to achieve the desired amplification and noise
properties. In this work, we propose a straightforward approach for operating
JPAs with the help of a look-up table (LUT) and online fine-tuning. Using the
proposed approach, we demonstrate the operation of a flux-driven JPA with 20 dB
gain around 5.9 GHz, covering approximately 100 MHz with 20 kHz tuning steps.
The proposed methodology was successfully used in the context of a haloscope

advances on SSL for point clouds. We first present an innovative taxonomy,
categorizing the existing SSL methods into four broad categories based on the
pretexts' characteristics. Under each category, we then further categorize the
methods into more fine-grained groups and summarize the strength and

ground state molecular properties at minimal cost. However, it has been held
back by our inability to compute the kinetic energy as a functional of the
electron density only. We here set out to learn the kinetic energy functional
from ground truth provided by the more expensive Kohn-Sham density functional
theory. Such learning is confronted with two key challenges: Giving the model
sufficient expressivity and spatial context while limiting the memory footprint
to afford computations on a GPU; and creating a sufficiently broad distribution
of training data to enable iterative density optimization even when starting
from a poor initial guess. In response, we introduce KineticNet, an equivariant
deep neural network architecture based on point convolutions adapted to the
prediction of quantities on molecular quadrature grids. Important contributions
include convolution filters with sufficient spatial resolution in the vicinity
of the nuclear cusp, an atom-centric sparse but expressive architecture that
relays information across multiple bond lengths; and a new strategy to generate
varied training data by finding ground state densities in the face of
perturbations by a random external potential. KineticNet achieves, for the
first time, chemical accuracy of the learned functionals across input densities
and geometries of tiny molecules. For two electron systems, we additionally
demonstrate OF-DFT density optimization with chemical accuracy.

  future of memorialization of mass atrocities","22 pages",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The memorialization of mass atrocities such as war crimes and genocides
facilitates the remembrance of past suffering, honors those who resisted the
perpetrators, and helps prevent the distortion of historical facts. Digital
technologies have transformed memorialization practices by enabling less
top-down and more creative approaches to remember mass atrocities. At the same
time, they may also facilitate the spread of denialism and distortion, attempt
to justify past crimes and attack the dignity of victims. The emergence of
generative forms of artificial intelligence (AI), which produce textual and
visual content, has the potential to revolutionize the field of memorialization
even further. AI can identify patterns in training data to create new
narratives for representing and interpreting mass atrocities - and do so in a
fraction of the time it takes for humans. The use of generative AI in this
context raises numerous questions: For example, can the paucity of training
data on mass atrocities distort how AI interprets some atrocity-related
inquiries? How important is the ability to differentiate between human- and
AI-made content concerning mass atrocities? Can AI-made content be used to
promote false information concerning atrocities? This article addresses these
and other questions by examining the opportunities and risks associated with
using generative AIs for memorializing mass atrocities. It also discusses
recommendations for AIs integration in memorialization practices to steer the
use of these technologies toward a more ethical and sustainable direction.

speech and are unavailable when only the silent video of an unseen speaker is
given. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot personalized Lip2Speech synthesis
method, in which face images control speaker identities. A variational
autoencoder is adopted to disentangle the speaker identity and linguistic
content representations, which enables speaker embeddings to control the voice
characteristics of synthetic speech for unseen speakers. Furthermore, we
propose associated cross-modal representation learning to promote the ability
of face-based speaker embeddings (FSE) on voice control. Extensive experiments
verify the effectiveness of the proposed method whose synthetic utterances are
more natural and matching with the personality of input video than the compared
methods. To our best knowledge, this paper makes the first attempt on zero-shot
personalized Lip2Speech synthesis with a face image rather than reference audio

this work, we detail this interdependence and motivate the necessary role of

contrast notions of compliance in the ethical, legal, and technical fields; we
outline both their differences and where they complement each other, with a
particular focus on the roles of ethical charters, licenses, and technical
documentation in these interactions. We then focus on the role of values in
articulating the synergies between the fields and outline specific mechanisms
of interaction between them in practice. We identify how these mechanisms have
played out in several open governance fora: an open collaborative workshop, a
responsible licensing initiative, and a proposed regulatory framework. By
leveraging complementary notions of compliance in these three domains, we can
create a more comprehensive framework for governing AI systems that jointly
takes into account their technical capabilities, their impact on society, and
how technical specifications can inform relevant regulations. Our analysis thus
underlines the necessity of joint consideration of the ethical, legal, and

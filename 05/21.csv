bottlenecks for pre-training language models (PLMs) with millions or even
trillions of parameters. A Flexible-Patience-Based Early Exiting method
(F-PABEE) has been proposed to alleviate the problems mentioned above for
single-label classification (SLC) and multi-label classification (MLC) tasks.
F-PABEE makes predictions at the classifier and will exit early if predicted
distributions of cross-layer are consecutively similar. It is more flexible
than the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) early exiting method PABEE because it
can simultaneously adjust the similarity score thresholds and the patience
parameters. Extensive experiments show that: (1) F-PABEE makes a better
speedup-accuracy balance than existing early exiting strategies on both SLC and
MLC tasks. (2) F-PABEE achieves faster inference and better performances on
different PLMs such as BERT and ALBERT. (3) F-PABEE-JSKD performs best for
F-PABEE with different similarity measures.

visual semantic understanding and fine-grained perception capabilities, we
discussed different visual tokenizers pre-trained with dominant methods (i.e.,
DeiT, CLIP, MAE, DINO), and observe that: i) Fully/weakly supervised models
capture more semantics than self-supervised models, but the gap is narrowed by
scaling up the pre-training dataset. ii) Self-supervised models are better at
fine-grained perception, where patch-level supervision is particularly
effective. iii) Tuning the visual tokenizer leads to the loss of semantics
obtained from large-scale pretraining, which is unfavorable with relatively
small-scale instruction-tuning dataset. Given the findings, we reviewed methods
that attempted to unify semantics and fine-grained visual understanding, e.g.,
patch-level feature distillation with semantically-rich targets. We obtain an
intriguing insight mask-based strategies that were once all the rage may not be
applicable for obtaining good visual tokenizers. Based on this critical
observation, we obtain a new MLLM equipped with a tailored Good Visual
Tokenizer (GVT), which exhibits strong visual comprehension capability at
multiple scales. In particular, without introducing extra parameters and
task-specific fine-tuning, GVT achieves superior performance on visual question

In this work, we study the impact of the trade-off between the intra-class
diversity (the number of samples per class) and the inter-class diversity (the
number of classes) of a supervised pre-training dataset. Empirically, we found
that with the size of the pre-training dataset fixed, the best downstream
performance comes with a balance on the intra-/inter-class diversity. To
understand the underlying mechanism, we show theoretically that the downstream
performance depends monotonically on both types of diversity. Notably, our
theory reveals that the optimal class-to-sample ratio (#classes / #samples per
class) is invariant to the size of the pre-training dataset, which motivates an
application of predicting the optimal number of pre-training classes. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this application by an improvement of around 2
points on the downstream tasks when using ImageNet as the pre-training dataset.

parameter spaces of physical theories defined at high energies, but constrained
by experimental measurements made at lower energies. Often, theoretical models
such as supersymmetry are defined by many parameters, $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$,
expressed at high energies, while relevant experimental constraints are often
defined at much lower energies, preventing them from directly ruling out
portions of the space. Instead, the low-energy constraints define a complex,
potentially non-contiguous subspace of the theory parameters. Naive scanning of
the theory space for points which satisfy the low-energy constraints is
hopelessly inefficient due to the high dimensionality, and the inverse problem
is considered intractable. As a result, many theoretical spaces remain
under-explored. We introduce a class of modified generative autoencoders, which
attack this problem by mapping the high-dimensional parameter space to a
structured low-dimensional latent space, allowing for easy visualization and
efficient generation of theory points which satisfy experimental constraints.
An extension without dimensional compression, which focuses on limiting

Multi-exit is a mainstream approach to address this issue by making a trade-off

unknown. Motivated by this, we first show that directly adapting existing

to medical images for computer vision tasks, and the modality gap between
vision and language can be solved by vision-language matching (VLM). However,
current vision-language models distort the intra-model relation and mainly
include class information in prompt learning that is insufficient for
segmentation task. In this paper, we introduce a Bi-level class-severity-aware
Vision-Language Graph Matching (Bi-VLGM) for text guided medical image
segmentation, composed of a word-level VLGM module and a sentence-level VLGM
module, to exploit the class-severity-aware relation among visual-textual
features. In word-level VLGM, to mitigate the distorted intra-modal relation
during VLM, we reformulate VLM as graph matching problem and introduce a
vision-language graph matching (VLGM) to exploit the high-order relation among
visual-textual features. Then, we perform VLGM between the local features for
each class region and class-aware prompts to bridge their gap. In
sentence-level VLGM, to provide disease severity information for segmentation
task, we introduce a severity-aware prompting to quantify the severity level of
retinal lesion, and perform VLGM between the global features and the
severity-aware prompts. By exploiting the relation between the local (global)
and class (severity) features, the segmentation model can selectively learn the
class-aware and severity-aware information to promote performance. Extensive
experiments prove the effectiveness of our method and its superiority to
existing methods. Source code is to be released.

image-guided wavefront-shaping experiment, where several 'virtual SLMs' are

uncertainty-aware deployment has been a growing concern in robotic control, as
uncertain actions informed by the learned model can lead to unstable motions or

Morphology of the precipitates varies from quasi-isometric octahedra to highly

adaptive network of veins filled with protoplasm. As it forages, Physarum
dynamically rearranges its network structure as a response to local stimuli
information, optimising the connection between food sources. This high-level
behaviour was already exploited to solve numerous optimisation problems. We
develop a flow-based model for the adaptive network formation of Physarum,
which solves some inconsistencies of previous models. We first derive a general
class of equations describing the adaptation and flow dynamics of a static
network comprised of elastic channels filled with an incompressible fluid
undergoing a Hagen-Poiseuille flow. An explicit form of the model is obtained
by minimising the total power dissipated by the network. Considering a more
general functional form of the adaptive equations, a phase transition in the
system is also found. The model is used for maze-solving and to build efficient
and resilient networks in an arena mimicking mainland Portugal. By comparing
the resulting networks with the real Portuguese railway system, we found that
the model produced networks with a better overall performance when considering
fluctuations in the network flows. Finally, the adaption model is extended to
incorporate the network growth in the presence of multiple food sources. The
coupling of both processes produces networks with similar traits to several
network systems found in nature. We found that when the food sources operate
alternately, the model can replicate the direct connections between the food
sources observed in Physarum.

floating wind turbine subjected to harmonic side-to-side and fore-aft motions
under laminar inflow conditions. The wake recovery is analysed as a function of
the frequency of motion, measured by the Strouhal number, St. Our findings
indicate that both directions of motion accelerate the transition to the
far-wake compared to the fixed turbine. The experimental outcomes confirm the
CFD results of Li et al. (2022) showing that sideways motions lead to faster
wake recovery, especially for St in [0.3, 0.6]. Additionally, we find that
fore-aft motions also lead to better recovery for St in [0.3, 0.9]. Moreover,
we see that the recovery is closely linked to non-linear spatio-temporal
dynamics. Special nonlinear dynamical effects are found in the shear layer
region of the wake (y = R). For both directions of motion and St in [0.25,
0.55], the noisy wake dynamics synchronise to the frequency of the motion. For
fore-aft motions and St in [0.55, 0.9], the wake shows more complex
quasi-periodic phenomena. In fact, the driven frequency and a selfgenerated
meandering mode emerge and interact non-linearly, as proved by occurring mixing
components. Sideways motions result in large spatial structures of meandering.
Fore-aft motions induce pulsing of the wake. Both modes are linked to the
synchronisation effect. The quasi-periodic phenomena of fore-aft motions are
connected to meandering mode. Overall, the spatio-temporal phenomena lead to
faster recovery likely due to an increase of momentum transport towards wake
centre.

revealed shared semantic dimensions that underlie concept representations in

modular components that connect to the cell's control system via IO channels,
meaning that the evolutionary process can replace one function with another

channel. A notable type of node function is the adhesion receptors that allow
cells to bind together into multicellular structures in which individuals can
share resource and signal to one another. The control system itself is modelled
as an artificial neural network that doubles as a gene regulatory network,
thereby permitting the co-evolution of form and function in a single data

instability of fastly rotating two-dimensional turbulent flows. Using the large
scale friction to model the effect of top and bottom boundaries, we study the
onset of three-dimensional perturbations on a rapidly rotating flow. The
friction term is taken to affect both the evolution of the two-dimensional
turbulent flow and the perturbations that evolve on top of it. Using direct
numerical simulations, the threshold for the onset of three-dimensional
perturbations is traced out as a function of the control parameters. As
reported in the earlier work (K. Seshasayanan and B. Gallet. 2020. Onset of
three-dimensionality in rapidly rotating turbulent flows), two different
mechanisms, namely the centrifugal and parametric type instabilities, are
responsible for the destabilisation across the wide range of parameters
explored in this study. In the turbulent regime, we find that the large scale
friction term does not affect the threshold in the case of centrifugal
instability while in the case of the parametric instability the instability
threshold is shifted to larger Rossby numbers. For the parametric instability,
the length scale of the unstable mode is found to scale as the inverse square
root of the rotation rate and the growth rate of the unstable mode is found to
be correlated with the minimum of the determinant of the strain rate tensor of
the underlying two-dimensional turbulent flow, showing resemblance with
elliptical type instabilities. Results from the turbulent flow are then
compared with the oscillatory Kolmogorov flow, which undergoes a parametric
instability resulting into inertial waves. The dependence of the threshold on
the aspect ratio of the system is discussed for both the turbulent and the
oscillating Kolmogorov flows.

frictions. In this study, we focus on the problem of hedging a given target
option by using multiple options. To extend the deep hedging framework to this
setting, the options used as hedging instruments also have to be priced during
training. While one might use classical pricing model such as the Black-Scholes
formula, ignoring frictions can offer arbitrage opportunities which are
undesirable for deep hedging learning. The goal of this study is to develop a
nested deep hedging method. That is, we develop a fully-deep approach of deep
hedging in which the hedging instruments are also priced by deep neural
networks that are aware of frictions. However, since the prices of hedging
instruments have to be calculated under many different conditions, the entire
learning process can be computationally intractable. To overcome this problem,
we propose an efficient learning method for nested deep hedging. Our method
consists of three techniques to circumvent computational intractability, each
of which reduces redundant computations during training. We show through
experiments that the Black-Scholes pricing of hedge instruments can admit
significant arbitrage opportunities, which are not observed when the pricing is
performed by deep hedging. We also demonstrate that our proposed method
successfully reduces the hedging risks compared to a baseline method that does
not use options as hedging instruments.

without the need for data transfer between edge and server, and is extremely
lightweight that most low-end edge devices can easily afford with negligible

competitive detection accuracy. Another salient feature is that it can
auto-adapt to probably any dataset without manually setting or configuring
model parameters or hyperparameters, which is a drawback of most existing

Previous studies mostly consider how to recover the representations of learned

representations and in this paper we propose a Supervised Contrastive learning
framework with adaptive classification criterion for Continual Learning (SCCL),
In our method, a contrastive loss is used to directly learn representations for
different tasks and a limited number of data samples are saved as the
classification criterion. During inference, the saved data samples are fed into
the current model to obtain updated representations, and a k Nearest Neighbour
module is used for classification. In this way, the extensible model can solve
the learned tasks with adaptive criteria of saved samples. To mitigate CF, we
further use an instance-wise relation distillation regularization term and a
memory replay module to maintain the information of previous tasks. Experiments
show that SCCL achieves state-of-the-art performance and has a stronger ability

complexity of the real-time dynamics, especially in the deconfined phase.
Inspired by the recent works of S. Ashkenazi and E. Zohar [Phys. Rev. A 105,
022431 (2022)] and of N. Tantivasadakarn, R. Thorngren, A. Vishwanath, and R.
Verresen [arXiv: 2112.01519], we propose to simulate dynamics of lattice gauge
theories by using the Kramers-Wannier transfomation via cluster-state-like
entanglers, mid-circuit measurements and feedforwarded corrections, which
altogether is a constant-depth deterministic operation. In our scheme,
specifically, we first quantum simulate the time evolution under a
corresponding symmetric Hamiltonian from an initial symmetric state, and then
apply the Kramers-Wannier procedure. This results in a wave function that has
time evolved under the corresponding lattice gauge theory from a corresponding
initial, gauged wave function. In the presence of noises in time evolution, the
procedure succeeds when we can pair up magnetic monopoles represented by
non-trivial measurement outcomes. Further, given a noise-free Kramers-Wannier
transformation, the resulting wave function from a noisy time evolution
satisfies the Gauss law constraint. We give explicit examples with the low
dimensional pure gauge theories and gauge theories coupled to bosonic/fermionic
matters such as the Fradkin-Shenker model.

reflect the degree of prior-data conflict, which is often unknown beforehand,
posing a significant obstacle to the application and acceptance of mixture
priors. To address this challenge, we introduce self-adapting mixture (SAM)
priors that determine the mixing weight using likelihood ratio test statistics.
SAM priors are data-driven and self-adapting, favoring the informative
(non-informative) prior component when there is little (substantial) evidence
of prior-data conflict. Consequently, SAM priors achieve dynamic information
borrowing. We demonstrate that SAM priors exhibit desirable properties in both
finite and large samples and achieve information-borrowing consistency.
Moreover, SAM priors are easy to compute, data-driven, and calibration-free,
mitigating the risk of data dredging. Numerical studies show that SAM priors
outperform existing methods in adopting prior-data conflicts effectively. We
developed an R package and web application that are freely available to

(SM) for single pulsar analyses, yielding model parameter posteriors with
significantly higher computational efficiency and fidelity. Furthermore, the
output of GM contains posteriors for the Fourier coefficients that can be used
to characterize the underlying red noise process of any pulsar's timing
residuals which are absent in current implementations of SM. Through
simulations, we demonstrate the potential for such coefficients to recover the
overall shape of the spatial cross-correlations between pulsar pairs produced
by gravitational waves.

data science, as it enables the reduction of high-dimensional covariates while
preserving the functional relation with certain response variables of interest.
However, existing SDR methods are not suitable for analyzing datasets collected
from case-control studies. In this setting, the goal is to learn and exploit
the low-dimensional structure unique to or enriched by the case group, also
known as the foreground group. While some unsupervised techniques such as the
contrastive latent variable model and its variants have been developed for this
purpose, they fail to preserve the functional relationship between the
dimension-reduced covariates and the response variable. In this paper, we
propose a supervised dimension reduction method called contrastive inverse

introduces an optimization problem defined on the Stiefel manifold with a
non-standard loss function. We prove the convergence of CIR to a local optimum

mixes are discussed in this study. The cost reduction is one of the main
advantages. Previous studies showed that analytical grades of Na2CO3 could
develop high strengths, but the costs outweighed the advantages. It can cost up
to 60% more to use pre-mixed analytical grade Na2CO3 in water than to use a
mixture that has been activated by NaOH pellets. Using industrial-grade
chemicals, however, could reduce the price of the latter by 91%. It saves 94.5
percent of the budget, even when compared to analytical Na2CO3 counterparts.
The paste rheology revealed that the soda-ash activated mixes had reasonable
yield stress to maintain good fluidity when combined as solid raw materials.
The improvement in strength is commendable, with a 28-day strength of 35.1 MPa.
The SEM-EDX analysis proved that soda ash was responsible for the higher
strength. The strength development result with higher gel structure formation
was confirmed by the evaluation of bound water. It can be concluded that using
the industrial grade chemical thus can effectively enhance strength and
mobility of the mix while also being mild, user-friendly and cost-effective.

while highly scalable and often identifying high-quality solutions, do not

optimality-oriented eye, by reformulating low-rank problems as convex problems
over the non-convex set of projection matrices and implementing a disjunctive
branch-and-bound scheme that solves them to certifiable optimality. Further, we
derive a novel and often tight class of convex relaxations by decomposing a
low-rank matrix as a sum of rank-one matrices and incentivizing, via a Shor
relaxation, that each two-by-two minor in each rank-one matrix has determinant
zero. In numerical experiments, our new convex relaxations decrease the

hypergraph robustness to random damage is not yet widely explored. While the
hypegraph structure can be always encoded in a factor graph, i.e. a bipartite
network between nodes and hyperedges, here we reveal that percolation on
hypegraphs is distinct from percolation on their corresponding factor graphs
when nodes are randomly damaged. Notably, we show that the node percolation
threshold on hypergraphs exceeds node percolation threshold on factor graphs.
Furthermore we show that differently from what happens in ordinary graphs,
containing only edges of cardinality $2$, on hypergraphs the node percolation
threshold and hyperedge percolation threshold do not coincide, with the node
percolation threshold exceeding the hyperedge percolation threshold. These
results are obtained within a message-passing theory valid in the locally
tree-like approximation of the factor graph. In the same approximation we
analytically predict the phase diagram and the critical properties of hypegraph
percolation on random hypergraphs and on multiplex hypergraphs. We compare the
results obtained for hypergraph percolation with the ones for percolation on
factor graphs and we validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and

are essential for scalable authentication and non-repudiation. Yet, NIST PQC
signature standards are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoT without considering
forward security. Moreover, Post-Quantum (PQ) signatures lack aggregation,
which is highly desirable to reduce the transmission and storage burdens in
DTs. Hence, there is an urgent need for lightweight digital signatures that
offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting an effective
transition into the PQ era for DTs.
  We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called
Hardware-ASsisted Efficient Signature (HASES) that meets the above
requirements. The core of HASES is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment
construct oracle (CCO) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments
without signer interaction. We created three HASES schemes: PQ-HASES is a
forward-secure PQ signature, LA-HASES is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve
signature, and HY-HASES is a novel hybrid scheme that combines PQ-HASES and
LA-HASES with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation. HASES does not
require a secure-hardware on the signer. We proved that HASES schemes are
secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and an 8-bit AVR ATmega2560.
Our experiments confirm that PQ-HASES and LA-HASES are two magnitudes of times

distributions of renewable energy, we establish game-theoretical models to
analyze equilibrium bidding strategies, market prices, and profits under
uniform pricing (UP) and pay-as-bid pricing (PAB). We prove that UP can
incentivize suppliers to withhold bidding quantities and lead to price spikes.
PAB can reduce the market price, but it may lead to a mixed-strategy price
equilibrium. Then, we present a regulated uniform pricing scheme (RUP) based on
suppliers' marginal costs that include penalty costs for real-time deviations.
We show that RUP can achieve lower yet positive prices and profits compared
with PAB in a duopoly market, which approximates the least-cost system outcome.
Simulations with synthetic and real data find that under PAB and RUP, higher
uncertainty of renewables and real-time shortage penalty prices can increase
the market price by encouraging lower bidding quantities, thereby increasing
suppliers' profits.

impactful applications. However, in many modern machine learning settings, the
benefits of ensembling are less ubiquitous and less obvious. We study, both
theoretically and empirically, the fundamental question of when ensembling
yields significant performance improvements in classification tasks.
Theoretically, we prove new results relating the \emph{ensemble improvement
rate} (a measure of how much ensembling decreases the error rate versus a
single model, on a relative scale) to the \emph{disagreement-error ratio}. We
show that ensembling improves performance significantly whenever the
disagreement rate is large relative to the average error rate; and that,
conversely, one classifier is often enough whenever the disagreement rate is
low relative to the average error rate. On the way to proving these results, we
derive, under a mild condition called \emph{competence}, improved upper and
lower bounds on the average test error rate of the majority vote classifier. To
complement this theory, we study ensembling empirically in a variety of
settings, verifying the predictions made by our theory, and identifying
practical scenarios where ensembling does and does not result in large
performance improvements. Perhaps most notably, we demonstrate a distinct
difference in behavior between interpolating models (popular in current
practice) and non-interpolating models (such as tree-based methods, where
ensembling is popular), demonstrating that ensembling helps considerably more

push beyond the standard quantum limit. In this work, we experimentally
demonstrate an alternative approach to reducing clock instability using a phase
estimation approach based on individually controlled atomic ensembles in a
strontium (Sr) optical lattice clock. We first demonstrate joint Ramsey
interrogation of two spatially-resolved atom ensembles that are out of phase
with respect to each other, which we call ""quadrature Ramsey spectroscopy,""
resulting in a factor of 1.36(5) reduction in absolute clock instability as
measured with interleaved self-comparisons. We then leverage the rich hyperfine
structure of ${}^{87}$Sr to realize independent coherent control over multiple
ensembles with only global laser addressing. Finally, we utilize this
independent control over 4 atom ensembles to implement a form of phase
estimation, achieving a factor of greater than 3 enhancement in coherent
interrogation time and a factor of 2.08(6) reduction in instability over an
otherwise identical single ensemble clock with the same local oscillator and
the same number of atoms. We expect that multi-ensemble protocols similar to
those demonstrated here will result in reduction in the instability of any
optical lattice clock with an interrogation time limited by the local
oscillator.

drastically expedites FL convergence by more than an order of magnitude. Also
surprisingly, despite the one-shot nature, its model accuracy is on par with or

photons lag behind high energy photons), meanwhile the absolute value of the

response to the Global Financial Crisis. More specifically, it analyzes the
Federal Reserve's quantitative easing (QE) programs, liquidity facilities, and

examination of these policies culminates in an interrupted time-series (ITS)
analysis of the long-term causal effects of the QE programs on U.S. inflation
and real GDP. The results of this formal design-based natural experimental
approach show that the QE operations positively affected U.S. real GDP but did
not significantly impact U.S. inflation. Specifically, it is found that, for
the 2011Q2-2018Q4 post-QE period, real GDP per capita in the U.S. increased by
an average of 231 dollars per quarter relative to how it would have changed had
the QE programs not been conducted. Moreover, the results show that, in 2018Q4,
ten years after the beginning of the QE programs, real GDP per capita in the
U.S. was 14% higher relative to what it would have been during that quarter had
there not been the QE programs. These findings contradict Williamson's (2017)
informal natural experimental evidence and confirm the conclusions of VARs and
new Keynesian DSGE models that the Federal Reserve's QE policies positively
affected U.S. real GDP. The results suggest that the current U.S. and worldwide
high inflation rates are likely not because of the QE programs implemented in
response to the financial crisis that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. They
are likely due to the unprecedentedly large fiscal stimulus packages used, the
peculiar nature of the financial downturn itself, the negative supply shocks
from the war in Ukraine, or a combination of these factors. This paper is the
first study to measure the macroeconomic effects of QE using a design-based
natural experimental approach.

various online platforms. Though attractive, integrated recommendation requires
the ranking methods to migrate from conventional user-item models to the new
user-channel-item paradigm in order to better capture users' preferences on
both item and channel levels. Moreover, practical feed recommendation systems
usually impose exposure constraints on different channels to ensure user
experience. This leads to greater difficulty in the joint ranking of
heterogeneous items. In this paper, we investigate the integrated
recommendation task with exposure constraints in practical recommender systems.
Our contribution is forth-fold. First, we formulate this task as a binary
online linear programming problem and propose a two-layer framework named
Multi-channel Integrated Recommendation with Exposure Constraints (MIREC) to
obtain the optimal solution. Second, we propose an efficient online allocation
algorithm to determine the optimal exposure assignment of different channels
from a global view of all user requests over the entire time horizon. We prove
that this algorithm reaches the optimal point under a regret bound of $
\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ with linear complexity. Third, we propose a series of
collaborative models to determine the optimal layout of heterogeneous items at
each user request. The joint modeling of user interests, cross-channel
correlation, and page context in our models aligns more with the browsing
nature of feed products than existing models. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on both offline datasets and online A/B tests to verify the
effectiveness of MIREC. The proposed framework has now been implemented on the

$\lambda(\phi)$ plays a central role in the enhancement of curvaton field
perturbation $\delta\chi$, serving as an effective friction term which can be
either positive or negative, depending on the shape of $\lambda(\phi)$, namely
the first derivative $\lambda_{,\phi}$. Our analysis reveals that $\delta\chi$
undergoes the superhorizon growth when the condition $\eta_\text{eff} \equiv -
2 \sqrt{2\epsilon} M_\text{Pl} { \lambda_{,\phi} \over \lambda} < -3$ is
satisfied. This is analogous to the mechanism responsible for the amplification
of curvature perturbations in the context of ultra-slow-roll inflation, namely
the growing modes dominate curvature perturbations. As a case study, we examine
the impact of a Gaussian dip in $\lambda(\phi)$ and conduct a thorough
investigation of both the analytical and numerical aspects of the inflationary

during inflation is not solely determined by the depth of the dip in
$\lambda(\phi)$. Rather, the shape of the dip also plays a significant role, a

worldwide. The presence of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries is the
underlying pathophysiological basis of CAD, and accurate extraction of

crucial for stenosis detection and CAD diagnosis. We propose an innovative
approach called the Edge Attention Graph Matching Network (EAGMN) for coronary

segmentation task into a graph node similarity comparison task, identifying the
node-to-node correspondence would assign semantic labels for each arterial

from the two individual graphs as input. Experimental results indicate the
EAGMN achieved a weighted accuracy of 0.8653, a weighted precision of 0.8656, a

latency, can lead to stuttering, poor video quality, and user frustration.
Despite extensive research, current real-time video systems still use
redundancy to handle packet loss, thus compromising on quality in the the
absence of packet loss. Since predicting packet loss is challenging, these
systems only enhance their resilience to packet loss after it occurs, leaving
some frames insufficiently protected against burst packet losses. They may also
add too much redundancy even after the packet loss has subsided. We present
Grace++, a new real-time video communication system. With Grace++, (i) a video
frame can be decoded, as long as any non-empty subset of its packets are
received, and (ii) the quality gracefully degrades as more packets are lost,
and (iii) approximates that of a standard codec (like H.265) in absence of
packet loss. To achieve this, Grace++ encodes and decodes frames by using
neural networks (NNs). It uses a new packetization scheme that makes packet
loss appear to have the same effect as randomly masking (zeroing) a subset of
elements in the NN-encoded output, and the NN encoder and decoder are specially
trained to achieve decent quality if a random subset of elements in the
NN-encoded output are masked. Using various test videos and real network
traces, we show that the quality of Grace++ is slightly lower than H.265 when
no packets are lost, but significantly reduces the 95th percentile of frame
delay (between encoding a frame and its decoding) by 2x when packet loss occurs
compared to other loss-resilient schemes while achieving comparable quality.
This is because Grace++ does not require retransmission of packets (unless all
packets are lost) or skipping of frames.

difficult or even impossible task because of absence of identifiers that can be
used to link sample and the frame. Secondly, the finite population frame
typically contains limited auxiliary variables, which may not be adequate for
building a reasonable working predictive model. We propose a data linkage
approach in which we replace the finite population frame by a big sample that
does not have the outcome binary variable of interest, but has a large set of
auxiliary variables. Our proposed method calls for fitting the assumed model
using data from the smaller sample, imputing the outcome variable for all the
units of the big sample, and then finally using these imputed values to obtain
standard weighted proportion using the big sample. We develop a new adjusted

Recently, deep generative models that aim to model molecule distribution have
made promising progress in narrowing down the chemical research space and
generating high-fidelity molecules. However, current generative models only
focus on modeling either 2D bonding graphs or 3D geometries, which are two
complementary descriptors for molecules. The lack of ability to jointly model
both limits the improvement of generation quality and further downstream
applications. In this paper, we propose a new joint 2D and 3D diffusion model
(JODO) that generates complete molecules with atom types, formal charges, bond
information, and 3D coordinates. To capture the correlation between molecular
graphs and geometries in the diffusion process, we develop a Diffusion Graph
Transformer to parameterize the data prediction model that recovers the
original data from noisy data. The Diffusion Graph Transformer interacts node
and edge representations based on our relational attention mechanism, while
simultaneously propagating and updating scalar features and geometric vectors.
Our model can also be extended for inverse molecular design targeting single or
multiple quantum properties. In our comprehensive evaluation pipeline for
unconditional joint generation, the results of the experiment show that JODO
remarkably outperforms the baselines on the QM9 and GEOM-Drugs datasets.
Furthermore, our model excels in few-step fast sampling, as well as in inverse
molecule design and molecular graph generation. Our code is provided in

Zirconium Oxide (HZO) based lateral DWs have been widely studied both with
theory and experiments. But DW of Head-to-Head/ Tail-to-Tail (H-H/T-T) type is
yet to be reported in HZO based FEs. In this work, we analyze T-T DW in
freestanding HZO and Metal-HZO-Metal structures with vacancy-free
non-stoichiometric oxygen termination using the first principles calculation.
Our analysis indicates that stable T-T DW forms in this type of structure, but
H-H DW is energetically unfavorable. This signifies the possibility of T-T DW
formation locally near vacancy-free region of HZO thin films. It is widely
known to the FE research community that FE HZO unit cell has unique
ferroelectric-dielectric (FE-DE) segmentation and different microscopic
configurations of both upward and downward polarized domains. Considering
different combinations of the domains, we find that cross pattern of DE and FE
segments in two neighboring domains along the polarization direction (where DE
segment of one domain faces the FE segment of the other domain) ensures the
stability of the T-T DW with minimum energy. Here, atomic configuration in the
T-T DW resembles $pbcn$ phase and the DW is half unit cell thick. Our
calculation indicates that polarization bound charges are being compensated by
ionic charges near the DW and surface/interface. In this work, we also
investigate domain kinetics to provide a more comprehensive understanding of

gaining support from cutting-edge hardware, such as NVIDIA's H100 GPU. However,
the superiority of low-bit INT versus FP formats for quantization on LLMs
remains unclear. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of INT and FP
quantization with the same bit-width, revealing that the optimal quantization
format varies across different layers due to the complexity and diversity of
tensor distribution. Consequently, we advocate the Mixture of Formats
Quantization (MoFQ), which selects the optimal format on a layer-wise basis.
This simple yet effective approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both
weight-only (W-only) and weight-activation (WA) post-training quantization
scenarios when tested on LLaMA across various tasks. In 4-bit W-only
quantization, MoFQ surpasses GPTQ without complex hyperparameter tuning and
with an order of magnitude faster quantization speed. While in 8-bit WA
quantization, MoFQ significantly outperforms INT/FP-only methods, achieving
performance close to the full precision model. Notably, MoFQ incurs no hardware
overhead compared to INT/FP-only quantization, as the bit-width remains

length $N$ are transmitted after $2^N$-PSK modulation over an AWGN channel. In
""Index Coded PSK Modulation for prioritized Receivers,"" the authors showed that
when a length-$N$ index code is transmitted as a $2^N$-PSK symbol, the ML
decoder at a receiver decodes directly to the message bit rather than following
the two-step decoding process of first demodulating the PSK symbol and
equivalently the index-coded bits and then doing index-decoding. In this paper,
we consider unprioritized receivers and follow the two-step decoding process at
the receivers. After estimating the PSK symbol using an ML decoder, at a
receiver, there might be more than one decoding strategy, i.e., a linear
combination of index-coded bits and different subsets of side information bits,
that can be used to estimate the requested message. Thomas et al. in [""Single
Uniprior Index Coding With Min Max Probability of Error Over Fading Channels,""]
showed that for binary-modulated index code transmissions, minimizing the
number of transmissions used to decode a requested message is equivalent to
minimizing the probability of error. This paper shows that this is no longer
the case while employing multi-level modulations. Further, we consider that the
side information available to each receiver is also noisy and derive an
expression for the probability that a requested message bit is estimated
erroneously at a receiver. We also show that the criterion for choosing a
decoding strategy that gives the best probability of error performance at a
receiver changes with the signal-to-noise ratio at which the side information
is broadcast.

modules to store and update the contexts within the conversation window,
enabling the model to capture dependencies between earlier and later parts of a

effectively align information from multi-modalities and leverage cross-person
attention to align behaviors in multi-party interactions. We evaluate the

parametric driving of $s$-wave scattering lengths. The dynamics for an initial
ferromagnetic phase is identical to that of a scalar condensate. In contrast,
intriguing dynamics emerges for an initial polar state. For instance, we show
that competition exists between density patterns and spin-mixing dynamics.
Dominant spin-mixing dynamics lead to a gas of polar core vortices and
anti-vortices of different spin textures. The density modes of the Bogoliubov
spectrum govern the wavenumber selection of Faraday patterns. The spin modes
determine the vortex density and the spatial dependence of spin-spin
correlation functions. When the density patterns outgrow the spin-mixing
dynamics, the spin-spin correlations decay exponentially with a correlation
length of the order a spin healing length; otherwise, they exhibit a Bessel
function dependence. Strikingly, competing instabilities within density and
spin modes emerge when both scattering lengths are modulated at different
frequencies and appropriate modulation amplitudes. The competing instability
leads to a superposition of density patterns or correlation functions of two
distinct wavelengths. Our studies reveal that fine control over the driven
dynamics can be attained by tuning interaction strengths, quadratic Zeeman

hierarchically interact the complementary information to strengthen domain

of Blok and Pigozzi and their equivalent algebraic semantics are, respectively,
the variety of Girard algebras and the variety of girales. We show that any
variety of girales has equationally definable principale congruences and we
classify all varieties of Girard algebras having this property. Also we
investigate the structure of the algebras in question, thus obtaining a
representation theorem for Girard algebras and girales. We also prove that
congruence lattices of girales are really congruence lattices of Heyting
algebras and we construct examples in order to show that the variety of girales
contains infinitely many nonisomorphic finite simple algebras.

measurement grids, combined with radar Doppler velocity measurements, are
further used to generate a Dynamic Grid Map (DGM). Experiments in real-world

the first one to learn a single-frame measurement grid in the polar scheme from

learned ISM independent of the radar mounting. This enables us to flexibly use
one or more radar sensors without network retraining and without requirements

  Correlation Diffusion Model",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral image change detection (HSI-CD) has emerged as a crucial
research area in remote sensing due to its ability to detect subtle changes on
the earth's surface. Recently, diffusional denoising probabilistic models
(DDPM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the generative domain. Apart
from their image generation capability, the denoising process in diffusion
models can comprehensively account for the semantic correlation of
spectral-spatial features in HSI, resulting in the retrieval of semantically
relevant features in the original image. In this work, we extend the diffusion
model's application to the HSI-CD field and propose a novel unsupervised HSI-CD
with semantic correlation diffusion model (DiffUCD). Specifically, the semantic
correlation diffusion model (SCDM) leverages abundant unlabeled samples and
fully accounts for the semantic correlation of spectral-spatial features, which
mitigates pseudo change between multi-temporal images arising from inconsistent
imaging conditions. Besides, objects with the same semantic concept at the same
spatial location may exhibit inconsistent spectral signatures at different
times, resulting in pseudo change. To address this problem, we propose a
cross-temporal contrastive learning (CTCL) mechanism that aligns the spectral
feature representations of unchanged samples. By doing so, the spectral
difference invariant features caused by environmental changes can be obtained.
Experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in
terms of Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa Coefficient (KC), and F1 scores,
achieving improvements of approximately 3.95%, 8.13%, and 4.45%, respectively.
Notably, our method can achieve comparable results to those fully supervised
methods requiring numerous annotated samples.

capture a diverse range of human motions in 3D scenes. However, such motion
data is costly, difficult to obtain and can never cover the full range of
plausible human-scene interactions in complex indoor environments. To address
these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to learn
policy networks that predict latent variables of a powerful generative motion
model that is trained on a large-scale motion capture dataset (AMASS). For
navigating in a 3D environment, we propose a scene-aware policy training scheme
with a novel collision avoidance reward function. Combined with the powerful
generative motion model, we can synthesize highly diverse human motions
navigating 3D indoor scenes, meanwhile effectively avoiding obstacles. For
detailed human-object interactions, we carefully curate interaction-aware
reward functions by leveraging a marker-based body representation and the
signed distance field (SDF) representation of the 3D scene. With a number of
important training design schemes, our method can synthesize realistic and

reranker that contextualizes the input text and the fact jointly. We validate
our DiFaR framework on multiple fact retrieval tasks, showing that it
significantly outperforms relevant baselines that use the three-step approach.

browse and interact with, have gained significant popularity in practical
applications. In feed products, users tend to browse a large number of items in
succession, so the previously viewed items have a significant impact on users'
behavior towards the following items. Therefore, traditional methods that
mainly focus on improving the accuracy of recommended items are suboptimal for
feed recommendations because they may recommend highly similar items. For feed
recommendation, it is crucial to consider both the accuracy and diversity of
the recommended item sequences in order to satisfy users' evolving interest
when consecutively viewing items. To this end, this work proposes a general
re-ranking framework named Multi-factor Sequential Re-ranking with
Perception-Aware Diversification (MPAD) to jointly optimize accuracy and
diversity for feed recommendation in a sequential manner. Specifically, MPAD
first extracts users' different scales of interests from their behavior
sequences through graph clustering-based aggregations. Then, MPAD proposes two
sub-models to respectively evaluate the accuracy and diversity of a given item
by capturing users' evolving interest due to the ever-changing context and
users' personal perception of diversity from an item sequence perspective. This
is consistent with the browsing nature of the feed scenario. Finally, MPAD
generates the return list by sequentially selecting optimal items from the
candidate set to maximize the joint benefits of accuracy and diversity of the
entire list. MPAD has been implemented in Taobao's homepage feed to serve the
main traffic and provide services to recommend billions of items to hundreds of

assuming either the same data distribution for training and testing, or the
system could have access to a large out-of-distribution (OoD) dataset for

communication systems need to handle unknown OoD data. Under such
circumstances, the powerful approximation ability of learning methods may force
the task-oriented communication systems to overfit the training data (i.e.,
in-distribution data) and provide overconfident judgments when encountering OoD

more power and increasing the number of antennas for EH, respectively.

the data-driven, black-box nature of modern AI techniques, comprehensively
identifying and measuring biases in conversational systems remains a
challenging task. Particularly, it is hard to generate inputs that can
comprehensively trigger potential bias due to the lack of data containing both
social groups as well as biased properties. In addition, modern conversational

makes existing bias detection methods simply based on the sentiment and the
toxicity hardly being adopted. In this paper, we propose BiasAsker, an
automated framework to identify and measure social bias in conversational AI

comprehensive social bias dataset, containing a total of 841 groups and 8,110
biased properties. Given the dataset, BiasAsker automatically generates
questions and adopts a novel method based on existence measurement to identify
two types of biases (i.e., absolute bias and related bias) in conversational

nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and a micromagnet. A time-independent parametric
drive can be utilized to increase the estimation precision of the tripartite
coupling strength. By calculating the quantum Fisher information (QFI), we can
obtain the optimal estimation precision by measuring the eigenstate of the
tripartite system. At the critical position, the QFI is divergent due to that
the preparation time of the eigenstate is divergent. When the system is
subjected to a dissipation, the QFI near the critical point of the
driven-dissipation phase transition is analytically obtained. The direct
intensity measurement is the optimal measurement near the dissipation phase
transition point. In addition, we quantify the robustness of an imperfect
measurement operator by the measurement noise susceptibility based on the error

robust against small measurement disturbance from a coherent drive. But it can
be disturbed by the nonlinear anti-harmonic measurement noise, especially near

for large enough classes of Hamiltonians (e.g., all local/sparse Hamiltonians),
existing simulation algorithms require running time at least linear in the

promising paradigm for institutions with limited language resources. This
approach allows multiple institutions to act as clients and train a unified
model through model synchronization, rather than collecting sensitive data for
centralized training. This significantly reduces the cost of corpus collection
and preserves data privacy. However, as pre-trained language models (PLMs)
continue to increase in size, the communication cost for transmitting
parameters during synchronization has become a training speed bottleneck. In
this paper, we propose a communication-efficient Fed-MNMT framework that
addresses this issue by keeping PLMs frozen and only transferring lightweight
adapter modules between clients. Since different language pairs exhibit
substantial discrepancies in data distributions, adapter parameters of clients
may conflict with each other. To tackle this, we explore various clustering
strategies to group parameters for integration and mitigate the negative
effects of conflicting parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework reduces communication cost by over 98% while achieving similar or
even better performance compared to competitive baselines. Further analysis
reveals that clustering strategies effectively solve the problem of linguistic
discrepancy and pruning adapter modules further improves communication
efficiency.

been applied for an accurate localization of pedestrians in a specific area,

However, previous methods rely on the supervision from the human annotated

burden in addition to the necessary camera calibration and synchronization.
Therefore, we propose in this paper an Unsupervised Multi-view Pedestrian
Detection approach (UMPD) to eliminate the need of annotations to learn a
multi-view pedestrian detector. 1) Firstly, Semantic-aware Iterative
Segmentation (SIS) is proposed to extract discriminative visual representations
of the input images from different camera views via an unsupervised pretrained
model, then convert them into 2D segments of pedestrians, based on our proposed
iterative Principal Component Analysis and the zero-shot semantic classes from
the vision-language pretrained models. 2) Secondly, we propose Vertical-aware
Differential Rendering (VDR) to not only learn the densities and colors of 3D
voxels by the masks of SIS, images and camera poses, but also constraint the
voxels to be vertical towards the ground plane, following the physical
characteristics of pedestrians. 3) Thirdly, the densities of 3D voxels learned
by VDR are projected onto Bird-Eyes-View as the final detection results.
Extensive experiments on popular multi-view pedestrian detection benchmarks,
i.e., Wildtrack and MultiviewX, show that our proposed UMPD approach, as the
first unsupervised method to our best knowledge, performs competitively with
the previous state-of-the-art supervised techniques. Code will be available.

we novelly introduce a contextual watermarking scheme to generate watermarked
variables more coherent in the context atop graph neural networks. Each
variable is treated as a node on the graph and the node feature gathers
neighborhood (context) information through learning. Watermarks embedded into
the features are thus reflected not only by the variables but also by the local
contexts. We further introduce a pre-trained model on source code as a teacher
to guide more natural variable generation. Throughout the embedding, the
operational semantics are preserved as only variable names are altered. Beyond
guaranteeing code-specific properties, CodeMark is superior in watermarking
accuracy, capacity, and efficiency due to a more diversified pattern generated.
Experimental results show CodeMark outperforms the SOTA watermarking systems

multiple languages due to the strongly imbalanced distribution of language
resources. A typical approach is to leverage off-the-shelf machine translation
(MT) systems to utilize either the training corpus or developed models from
high-resource languages. In this work, we investigate whether it is helpful to
utilize MT at all in this task. To do so, we simulate a low-resource scenario
assuming access to limited Chinese dialog data in the movie domain and large
amounts of English dialog data from multiple domains. Experiments show that
leveraging English dialog corpora can indeed improve the naturalness, relevance
and cross-domain transferability in Chinese. However, directly using English
dialog corpora in its original form, surprisingly, is better than using its
translated version. As the topics and wording habits in daily conversations are
strongly culture-dependent, MT can reinforce the bias from high-resource
languages, yielding unnatural generations in the target language. Considering
the cost of translating large amounts of text and the strong effects of the
translation quality, we suggest future research should rather focus on
utilizing the original English data for cross-lingual transfer in dialog
generation. We perform extensive human evaluations and ablation studies. The

available mechanism of $\mathbb{L}^2$ space. The time-dependent (TD)
Schr\""{o}dinger equation for the system is solved with the Lewis-Riesenfeld
(LR) phase space method. The eigenstates of the LR-invariant operator
($\hat{\mathcal{I}}$) is obtained after transforming $\hat{\mathcal{I}}$ to its
diagonal symplectic equivalent form (group $Sp(2, \mathbb{R})$). Both the
dynamical and geometrical phase factors associated with the eigenstates of
$\hat{\mathcal{I}}$ are explicitly written. The experimental pheasibility of
our result is outlined through the construction of Wigner quasiprobability
distribution. Moreover, we have demostrated the time variation of the Wigner
distribution for the system consisting of two spatially separated prepared
ground state of the TD-parametric amplifier. With graphical illustration of
time variation of Wigner distributions, we show that the phase-space
entanglement remains intact even for time-dependent situation, no matter how
far the particles goes, at least for the cat-state under consideration. The
exact expressions for the physically relevant qualities are obtained and
illustrated for a toy model.

high-throughput experiments and computational analysis. This is typically done
as a statistical enrichment analysis that measures the over- or
under-representation of biological function terms associated with genes or
their properties, based on curated assertions from a knowledge base (KB) such
as the Gene Ontology (GO). Interpreting gene lists can also be framed as a
textual summarization task, enabling the use of Large Language Models (LLMs),
potentially utilizing scientific texts directly and avoiding reliance on a KB.
  We developed SPINDOCTOR (Structured Prompt Interpolation of Natural Language
Descriptions of Controlled Terms for Ontology Reporting), a method that uses
GPT models to perform gene set function summarization as a complement to
standard enrichment analysis. This method can use different sources of gene
functional information: (1) structured text derived from curated ontological KB
annotations, (2) ontology-free narrative gene summaries, or (3) direct model
retrieval.
  We demonstrate that these methods are able to generate plausible and
biologically valid summary GO term lists for gene sets. However, GPT-based
approaches are unable to deliver reliable scores or p-values and often return
terms that are not statistically significant. Crucially, these methods were
rarely able to recapitulate the most precise and informative term from standard
enrichment, likely due to an inability to generalize and reason using an
ontology. Results are highly nondeterministic, with minor variations in prompt
resulting in radically different term lists. Our results show that at this
point, LLM-based methods are unsuitable as a replacement for standard term
enrichment analysis and that manual curation of ontological assertions remains
necessary.

considering general entropy for the cosmological apparent horizon. Although the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy has been successful in the study of the
thermodynamics of black holes and cosmology, according to the laws of
thermodynamics, considering this entropy, it imposes a $w=-1$ limit on the
equation of state of the cosmic fluid. To address this limitation, Nojiri and
colleagues in 2022, introduced generalized entropies with four-parameters that
may tend to familiar entropies and can solve some problems of cosmology. In
this paper, we explore how correcting the entropy affects the Energy-momentum
tensor of the cosmic flux from the outset. Our calculations show that in any
way, the modified Bekenstein-Hawking entropy can be still considered as a
general entropy after a modification energy-momentum density tensor with a
correction function $f(\rho)$. The function $f(\rho)$ can be easily
reconstructed, by considering the thermodynamics of the apparent horizon. We
also study the first and second laws of thermodynamics in this context and show
how the problem of limited cosmic flux can be resolved based on the model's
parameters. At last, In order to study the kinematics of the universe,
cosmography parameters are also calculated and we see that the correction
function $f(\rho)$ has a non-negligible role in cosmography parameters. This
paper provides valuable insights into using general entropies on the apparent
horizon of the universe.

analysis. However, training deep models requires large amounts of labeled data,
which is often scarce in brain network datasets due to the complexities of data

intrinsic brain network structures, regardless of clinical outcomes, and is
easily adaptable to various downstream tasks. PTGB comprises two key
components: (1) an unsupervised pre-training technique designed specifically
for brain networks, which enables learning from large-scale datasets without
task-specific labels; (2) a data-driven parcellation atlas mapping pipeline
that facilitates knowledge transfer across datasets with different ROI systems.
Extensive evaluations using various GNN models have demonstrated the robust and
superior performance of PTGB compared to baseline methods.

are learned by maximizing mutual information between skills and states, and
each skill corresponds to a continuous value on a sphere. Because the

because every time the prices of a company stock keeps changing and not
constant. So, its complex to determine the stock data. But if the previous
performance of a company in stock market is known, then we can track the data
and provide predictions to stockholders in order to wisely take decisions on
handling the stocks to a company. To handle this, many machine learning models
have been invented but they didn't succeed due to many reasons like absence of
advanced libraries, inaccuracy of model when made to train with real time data
and much more. So, to track the patterns and the features of data, a CNN-LSTM
Neural Network can be made. Recently, CNN is now used in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) based applications, so by identifying the features from stock
data and converting them into tensors, we can obtain the features and then send
it to LSTM neural network to find the patterns and thereby predicting the stock
market for given period of time. The accuracy of the CNN-LSTM NN model is found
to be high even when allowed to train on real-time stock market data. This
paper describes about the features of the custom CNN-LSTM model, experiments we
made with the model (like training with stock market datasets, performance
comparison with other models) and the end product we obtained at final stage.

models. As an inherent nature of big data, data heterogeneity widely exists in
real-world recommendation systems. It reflects the differences in the
properties among sub-populations. Ignoring the heterogeneity in recommendation
data could limit the performance of recommendation models, hurt the
sub-populational robustness, and make the models misled by biases. However,
data heterogeneity has not attracted substantial attention in the
recommendation community. Therefore, it inspires us to adequately explore and
exploit heterogeneity for solving the above problems and assisting data
analysis. In this work, we focus on exploring two representative categories of
heterogeneity in recommendation data that is the heterogeneity of prediction
mechanism and covariate distribution and propose an algorithm that explores the
heterogeneity through a bilevel clustering method. Furthermore, the uncovered
heterogeneity is exploited for two purposes in recommendation scenarios which
are prediction with multiple sub-models and supporting debias. Extensive
experiments on real-world data validate the existence of heterogeneity in
recommendation data and the effectiveness of exploring and exploiting data

advantages over conventional state-of-the-art techniques that rely on cameras
and sensors, including lower costs and ease of deployment. However, a
significant challenge associated with Wi-Fi-based HAR is the significant
decline in performance when the scene or subject changes. To mitigate this
issue, it is imperative to train the model using an extensive dataset. In
recent studies, the utilization of CNN-based models or sequence-to-sequence
models such as LSTM, GRU, or Transformer has become prevalent. While
sequence-to-sequence models can be more precise, they are also more
computationally intensive and require a larger amount of training data. To
tackle these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages a temporal
convolution network with augmentations and attention, referred to as TCN-AA.

Designing concurrent data structures involves inferring correct synchronization
code starting with a prior understanding of the sequential data structure's
operations. Further, an understanding of shared memory model and the
synchronization primitives is also required. The reasoning involved
transforming a sequential data structure into its concurrent version can be
performed using Answer Set Programming and we mechanized our approach in
previous work. The reasoning involves deduction and abduction that can be
succinctly modeled in ASP. We assume that the abstract sequential code of the
data structure's operations is provided, alongside axioms that describe
concurrent behavior. This information is used to automatically derive
concurrent code for that data structure, such as dictionary operations for
linked lists and binary search trees that involve a constant number of
destructive update operations. We also are able to infer the correct set of
locks (but not code synthesis) for external height-balanced binary search trees
that involve left/right tree rotations. Locksynth performs the analyses
required to infer correct sets of locks and as a final step, also derives the
C++ synchronization code for the synthesized data structures. We also provide a
performance analysis of the C++ code synthesized by Locksynth with the
hand-crafted versions available from the Synchrobench microbenchmark suite. To
the best of our knowledge, our tool is the first to employ ASP as a backend

internal demands for change, citizens' dissatisfaction and frustration with
public sector organizations, that need to be addressed. An alternative to the
traditional top-down development of public services is co-creation of public
services. Co-creation promotes collaboration between stakeholders with the aim
to create better public services and achieve public values. At the same time,
data analytics has been fuelled by the availability of immense amounts of
textual data. Whilst both co-creation and TA have been used in the private
sector, we study existing works on the application of Text Analytics (TA)
techniques on text data to support public service co-creation. We
systematically review 75 of the 979 papers that focus directly or indirectly on
the application of TA in the context of public service development. In our
review, we analyze the TA techniques, the public service they support, public
value outcomes, and the co-creation phase they are used in. Our findings
indicate that the TA implementation for co-creation is still in its early
stages and thus still limited. Our research framework promotes the concept and
stimulates the strengthening of the role of Text Analytics techniques to
support public sector organisations and their use of co-creation process. From
policy-makers' and public administration managers' standpoints, our findings
and the proposed research framework can be used as a guideline in developing a
strategy for the designing co-created and user-centred public services.

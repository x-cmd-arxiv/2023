tensorial extension of matrix robust principal component analysis (RPCA), that
aims to split the given tensor into an underlying low-rank component and a
sparse outlier component. This work proposes a fast algorithm, called Robust
Tensor CUR Decompositions (RTCUR), for large-scale non-convex TRPCA problems
under the Tucker rank setting. RTCUR is developed within a framework of
alternating projections that projects between the set of low-rank tensors and
the set of sparse tensors. We utilize the recently developed tensor CUR
decomposition to substantially reduce the computational complexity in each
projection. In addition, we develop four variants of RTCUR for different
application settings. We demonstrate the effectiveness and computational
advantages of RTCUR against state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and

designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning (FL). Tremendous existing
studies attempt to design the solutions using various approaches (e.g., game
theory, reinforcement learning) under different settings. Yet the design of
incentive mechanism could be significantly biased in that clients' performance
in many applications is stochastic and hard to estimate. Properly handling this
stochasticity motivates this research, as it is not well addressed in
pioneering literature. In this paper, we focus on cross-device FL and propose a
multi-level FL architecture under the real scenarios. Considering the two
properties of clients' situations: uncertainty, correlation, we propose FL
Incentive Mechanism based on Portfolio theory (FL-IMP). As far as we are aware,
this is the pioneering application of portfolio theory to incentive mechanism
design aimed at resolving FL resource allocation problem. In order to more
accurately reflect practical FL scenarios, we introduce the Federated Learning
Agent-Based Model (FL-ABM) as a means of simulating autonomous clients. FL-ABM
enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence the
system's outcomes. Experimental evaluations of our approach have extensively
validated its effectiveness and superior performance in comparison to the

manual effort, Zero-shot-CoT concatenates the target problem statement with
""Let's think step by step"" as an input prompt to LLMs. Despite the success of
Zero-shot-CoT, it still suffers from three pitfalls: calculation errors,
missing-step errors, and semantic misunderstanding errors. To address the
missing-step errors, we propose Plan-and-Solve (PS) Prompting. It consists of
two components: first, devising a plan to divide the entire task into smaller

progress in numerous applications, from filtration to vascular transport.
Thermal or active fluctuations of channel walls for fluid-filled channels can
slow down or increase the dispersion of tracer particles. Entropic trapping in
the wall bulges slows dispersion, and hydrodynamic flows induced by wall
fluctuations enhance dispersion. Previous studies primarily concentrated on the
case of a single Brownian tracer either embedded in an incompressible fluid or
in the ideal case where the presence of fluid is ignored. Here we address the
question of what happens when there is a large ensemble of interacting Brownian
tracers -- a common situation in applications. Introducing repulsive
interactions between the tracer particles, while ignoring the presence of a
background fluid, leads to an effective flow field. This flow field enhances
tracer dispersion, a phenomenon strongly reminiscent of that seen in
incompressible background fluid. We characterise the dispersion by the
long-time diffusion coefficient of a single tracer, numerically and
analytically with a mean-field density functional analysis. We find a
surprising effect where an increased particle density enhances the diffusion
coefficient, challenging the notion that crowding effects tend to reduce
diffusion. Here, inter-particle interactions push particles closer to the
fluctuating channel walls. Then, interactions between the fluctuating wall and
the now-nearby particles drive particle mixing. Our mechanism is sufficiently
general that we expect it to apply to various systems. In addition, the
perturbation theory we derive quantifies dispersion in generic
advection-diffusion systems with arbitrary spatiotemporal drift.

novelty of pawn games is that control of vertices changes dynamically

In each turn, the pawns are partitioned between the two players, and the player
who controls the pawn that owns the vertex on which the token is located,
chooses the next location of the token. Control of pawns changes dynamically

complex and customised designs quickly and cost-effectively, reducing material
waste, and enabling on-demand production. However, several security challenges

from individual hackers to organised criminal gangs and nation-state actors.
This paper addresses the cyber risk in AM to attackers by proposing a novel
semantic-based threat prioritisation system for identifying, extracting and
ranking indicators of compromise (IOC). The system leverages the heterogeneous
information networks (HINs) that automatically extract high-level IOCs from
multi-source threat text and identifies semantic relations among the IOCs. It
models IOCs with a HIN comprising different meta-paths and meta-graphs to
depict semantic relations among diverse IOCs. We introduce a domain-specific
recogniser that identifies IOCs in three domains: organisation-specific,
regional source-specific, and regional target-specific. A threat assessment
uses similarity measures based on meta-paths and meta-graphs to assess semantic
relations among IOCs. It prioritises IOCs by measuring their severity based on
the frequency of attacks, IOC lifetime, and exploited vulnerabilities in each
domain.

in the trial arms are not mature for the research question under investigation,
for example because the curves are still close to 1 at that time. This means
that the decision is based on a small percentage of the events in the long run
only; possibly the events of the more frail patients in the trial who may not

conclude effectiveness based on so little information. Criteria to determine
the moment the interim analysis will be performed, should be chosen with care,

conceptually from the commonly used synergistic hybrid approaches. The key idea
involves the construction of a generalized synergistic Lyapunov function whose
switching variable can either remain constant or dynamically change between
jumps. Based on this new hybrid mechanism, a generalized synergistic hybrid
feedback control scheme, endowed with global asymptotic stability guarantees,
is proposed. This hybrid control scheme is then improved through a smoothing
mechanism that eliminates discontinuities in the feedback term. Moreover, the
smooth hybrid feedback is further extended to a larger class of systems through
the integrator backstepping approach. The proposed hybrid feedback schemes are
applied to solve the global obstacle avoidance problem using a new concept of
synergistic navigation functions. Finally, numerical simulation results are
presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed hybrid controllers.

learning for code, utilizing a two-stage pre-training and fine-tuning procedure
to acquire general knowledge about code and specialize in a variety of
downstream tasks. However, the dynamic nature of software codebases poses a
challenge to the effectiveness and robustness of PLMs. In particular,
world-realistic scenarios potentially lead to significant differences between
the distribution of the pre-training and test data, i.e., distribution shift,
resulting in a degradation of the PLM's performance on downstream tasks. In
this paper, we stress the need for adapting PLMs of code to software data whose
distribution changes over time, a crucial problem that has been overlooked in
previous works. The motivation of this work is to consider the PLM in a
non-stationary environment, where fine-tuning data evolves over time according
to a software evolution scenario. Specifically, we design a scenario where the
model needs to learn from a stream of programs containing new, unseen APIs over
time. We study two widely used PLM architectures, i.e., a GPT2 decoder and a
RoBERTa encoder, on two downstream tasks, API call and API usage prediction. We
demonstrate that the most commonly used fine-tuning technique from prior work
is not robust enough to handle the dynamic nature of APIs, leading to the loss
of previously acquired knowledge i.e., catastrophic forgetting. To address
these issues, we implement five continual learning approaches, including
replay-based and regularization-based methods. Our findings demonstrate that
utilizing these straightforward methods effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting in PLMs across both downstream tasks while achieving comparable or
superior performance.

This suboptimality of first-order debiasing has motivated the development of

methods have made decent achievements in this task, they not only severely rely
on abundant video-query paired data for training, but also easily fail into the
dataset distribution bias. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce a novel
Equivariant Consistency Regulation Learning (ECRL) framework to learn more
discriminative query-related frame-wise representations for each video, in a
self-supervised manner. Our motivation comes from that the temporal boundary of
the query-guided activity should be consistently predicted under various
video-level transformations. Concretely, we first design a series of
spatio-temporal augmentations on both foreground and background video segments
to generate a set of synthetic video samples. In particular, we devise a
self-refine module to enhance the completeness and smoothness of the augmented
video. Then, we present a novel self-supervised consistency loss (SSCL) applied
on the original and augmented videos to capture their invariant query-related
semantic by minimizing the KL-divergence between the sequence similarity of two
videos and a prior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. At last, a
shared grounding head is introduced to predict the transform-equivariant
query-guided segment boundaries for both the original and augmented videos.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets (ActivityNet, TACoS, and
Charades-STA) demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
ECRL framework.

This paper proposes to coordinate the operation of the two systems via a fully
decentralized framework where the PDN and TN operators solve their own
operation problems by sharing only limited information. Nevertheless, the
operation problems generally are in mixed-integer programming (MIP) form. To
the best of our knowledge, the most existing decentralized/distributed
optimization algorithms, such as the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), are not always guaranteed to converge for such MIP
problems. Therefore, a novel fully decentralized optimization algorithm is
proposed, whose contributions include: 1) it is applicable to MIP problems with
convergence and optimality guaranteed for mild assumptions, 2) it only requires
limited information exchange between PDN and TN operators, which will help
preserve the privacy of the two systems and reduce the investment in building
communication channels, and 3) it is fully decentralized so that all the
computations are carried out by PDN operator and TN coordinator only.
Simulations on the test cases show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed

Our study analyzes the trajectory, surface area, velocity and membrane stress

channel Reynolds number $Re$ ranges from 0.01 to 50 and the Capillary number
$Ca$, which measures the ratio of the viscous and elastic stresses, ranges from
0.075 to 0.35. We find that in the inertial regime, the membrane stretch and

deformation is observed to depend nearly linearly on $Ca$ and $Re$.
Additionally, we report a repelling mechanism between two confined capsules

$d_c$. The deformation of the leading capsule is found to be mitigated by the
presence of the following capsule. In the case of multiple capsules flowing
through the corner, we observe that the increase in the maximum surface area of
the trailing capsules eventually saturates at the tail of the train. Moreover,
we find that the corner tends to separate the capsules regardless of their

in observed covariates in subgroups discovered from the data. Our case study
shows significant and persistent effects of nonfatal firearm injuries on
several health outcomes for those injured and on the mental health of their

intent, for families, effects are strongest for those whose relative's injury

For important classes of polynomial covariance commutation relations associated
to arbitrary monomials and to affine functions, these conditions on the kernels
are specified in terms of the coefficients of the monomials and affine
functions. By applying these conditions, examples of integral operators on
$L_p$ spaces, with separable kernels representing covariance commutation

However, quantum systems are inherently susceptible to noises, which adversely
corrupt the information encoded in quantum systems. In this work, we introduce
an efficient algorithm that can recover information from quantum states under
Pauli noise. The core idea is to learn the necessary information of the unknown
Pauli channel by post-processing the classical shadows of the channel. For a
local and bounded-degree observable, only partial knowledge of the channel is
required rather than its complete classical description to recover the ideal
information, resulting in a polynomial-time algorithm. This contrasts with
conventional methods such as probabilistic error cancellation, which requires
the full information of the channel and exhibits exponential scaling with the
number of qubits. We also prove that this scalable method is optimal on the
sample complexity and generalise the algorithm to the weight contracting
channel. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of the algorithm on the 1D
anisotropic Heisenberg-type model via numerical simulations. As a notable
application, our method can be severed as a sample-efficient error mitigation
scheme for Clifford circuits.

respective single-modal encoder separately to convert multimodal information
into languages. (2) Aligning X2L representations with the LLM: single-modal
encoders are aligned with the LLM through X2L interfaces independently. (3)
Integrating multiple modalities: all single-modal encoders are aligned with the
LLM through X2L interfaces to integrate multimodal capabilities into the LLM.
Our experiments show that X-LLM demonstrates impressive multimodel chat
abilities, sometimes exhibiting the behaviors of multimodal GPT-4 on unseen
images/instructions, and yields a 84.5\% relative score compared with GPT-4 on

isotropically in glass. We introduce an anisotropy parameter $k$ for each
Voronoi cell, which mean value exhibits a sharp change at the mode-coupling
glass transition $\phi_\mathrm{c}$. Moreover, a power law of packing fraction
$\phi\propto q_1^{-d}$ is discovered in the liquid regime with $d>D$, in
contrast to $d=D$ in the glass regime, where $q_1$ is the first peak position
of structure factor, and $D$ is the space dimension. This power law is
explained by the change of $k$. The active motions in supercooled liquid are
spatially correlated with long axes rather than short axes of Voronoi cells. In
addition, the dynamic slowing down approaching the glass transition can be well
characterized through a modified free volume model based on $k$. These findings
reveal that the nonagnostic structural parameter $k$ determines glassy dynamics

intending to improve the efficiency of the DRL algorithm, employs a Vectorized

collection from model optimization by multithreading, and partially connects
the two procedures by harnessing a Time Feedback Mechanism (TFM) to evade data
underuse or overuse. Meanwhile, the Sparrow simulator utilizes a 2D grid-based
world, simplified kinematics, and conversion-free data flow to achieve a
lightweight design. The lightness facilitates vectorized diversity, allowing
diversified simulation setups across extensive copies of the vectorized

Granger-lag profiles from 14 XMM-Newton observations of IRAS 13224-3809, and

obtained Granger (intrinsic) lags are ~ 200-500 s. With the IRAS 13224-3809
mass of 2 $\times 10^6$ $M_{\odot}$, these lags correspond to the true
light-travel distance of ~ 20-50 $r_g$. Hence, by assuming a lamp-post geometry

the corona height can significantly evolve from ~ 10-25 $r_{g}$ to ~ 55

topologically nontrivial polar structures, such as vortices or skyrmions,
depending on mechanical or electrical boundary conditions. These structures
have been experimentally observed only in thin film model systems, where they
are engineered by balancing electrostatic charge and elastic distortion
energies. However, the measurement and classification of topological textures
for general ferroelectric nanostructures have remained elusive, as it requires
mapping the local polarization at the atomic scale in three dimensions. Here we
unveil topological polar structures in ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanoparticles via
atomic electron tomography, which enables us to reconstruct the full
three-dimensional arrangement of cation atoms. Our three-dimensional
polarization maps reveal a clear vortex ordering, along with evidence of
size-dependent topological transitions from a single vortex structure to
multiple vortices. These findings not only allow a comprehensive understanding
of the complex topological nature of nanoscale ferroelectrics but also have the
potential for practical applications utilizing contact-free switchable toroidal
moments.

investigate whether some stars also show an i-process signature, as sometimes
found in their lower metallicity counterparts (namely, the Carbon-Enhanced

HERMES spectra for Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu, using the TURBOSPECTRUM radiative
transfer LTE code with MARCS model atmospheres. Using the new classification
scheme proposed in our recent study we find that two stars show overabundances
in both s- and r-process elements well above the level expected from the
Galactic chemical evolution, an analogous situation to the one of CEMP-rs stars
at lower metallicities. We compare the abundances of the most enriched stars
with the nucleosynthetic predictions from the STAREVOL stellar evolutionary
code and find abundances compatible with an i-process occurring in AGB stars.
Despite a larger number of heavy elements to characterize the enrichment
pattern, the limit between CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars remains fuzzy. It is
however interesting to note that an increasing number of extrinsic stars are
found to have abundances better reproduced by an i-process pattern even at

Then, this scheme conducts Gaussian elimination (GE) on a k-by-k full-rank

recovered dual words, aiming to improve the reliability of recovery. Finally,
it performs decoding on the received codewords with partially recovered dual

noise level scenarios. The GEV that combines Gaussian elimination and
verification has a significantly lower recovery failure probability and a much
lower computational complexity than an existing Canteaut-Chabaud-based
algorithm, which relies on GE on n-by-n full-rank matrices. The decoding-aided
recovery (DAR) and error-detection-&-codeword-selection-&-decoding-aided

for high noise level scenarios, and their computational complexities remain
much lower than the Canteaut-Chabaud-based algorithm.

in providing IoV services. High altitude platform station (HAPS) computing can
be a promising addition to existing distributed computing frameworks because of
its wide coverage and strong computational capabilities. In this regard, this
paper proposes an adaptive scheme in a new distributed computing framework that
involves HAPS computing to deal with the two problems of the IoV. Based on the
diverse demands of vehicles, network dynamics, and the time-sensitivity of
handoffs, the proposed scheme flexibly divides each task into three parts and
assigns them to the vehicle, roadside units (RSUs), and a HAPS to perform
synchronous computing. The scheme also constrains the computing of tasks at
RSUs such that they are completed before handoffs to avoid the risk of
computing interruptions. On this basis, we formulate a delay minimization

constrain the capacity to model each subject's domain variance. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach to model human artifact removal as a generative

Domain Specific Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DS-DDPM), which
decomposes the denoising process into subject domain variance and invariant

This method is the first to explicitly separate human subject-specific variance

aspects: 1) DS-DDPM can learn more accurate subject-specific domain variance
through domain generative learning compared to traditional filtering methods,
and 2) DS-DDPM is the first approach capable of explicitly generating subject

simulations, we investigate the response of a prototypical sodium silicate
glass under shape contact load up to an indentation depth of 25 nm. Both the
short- and intermediate-range structures are found to exhibit notable changes
below the indent, indicating that indentation deformation induces a more
disordered and heterogeneous network structure. In addition, we find that the
indentation-induced changes of local properties all exhibit an exponential
decaying behavior with increasing distance from the indent. Comparison of the
characteristic decay lengths of these local properties indicates that the
structural origins of shear flow and densification are the changes of the
network modifier's coordination environment and the inter-tetrahedral

than that of shear strain, implying that the former might contribute more to
the deformation at the far-field regions. Our findings not only contribute to

beneficial for the seperation among known classes. Motivated by the phenomenon,

to mitigate the negative impact of geometric distortions. Extensive results on

  In this work, we perform the first empirical study to evaluate ChatGPT's
capability of unit test generation. Specifically, we conduct a quantitative

Our findings indicate that generating unit tests with ChatGPT could be very

  Inspired by our findings above, we propose ChatTESTER, a novel ChatGPT-based

  Geometry-based Cascaded Neural Network",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Segmentation of the coronary artery is an important task for the quantitative
analysis of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) images and is being
stimulated by the field of deep learning. However, the complex structures with
tiny and narrow branches of the coronary artery bring it a great challenge.
Coupled with the medical image limitations of low resolution and poor contrast,
fragmentations of segmented vessels frequently occur in the prediction.
Therefore, a geometry-based cascaded segmentation method is proposed for the
coronary artery, which has the following innovations: 1) Integrating geometric
deformation networks, we design a cascaded network for segmenting the coronary
artery and vectorizing results. The generated meshes of the coronary artery are
continuous and accurate for twisted and sophisticated coronary artery
structures, without fragmentations. 2) Different from mesh annotations
generated by the traditional marching cube method from voxel-based labels, a
finer vectorized mesh of the coronary artery is reconstructed with the
regularized morphology. The novel mesh annotation benefits the geometry-based
segmentation network, avoiding bifurcation adhesion and point cloud dispersion
in intricate branches. 3) A dataset named CCA-200 is collected, consisting of
200 CCTA images with coronary artery disease. The ground truths of 200 cases
are coronary internal diameter annotations by professional radiologists.
Extensive experiments verify our method on our collected dataset CCA-200 and
public ASOCA dataset, with a Dice of 0.778 on CCA-200 and 0.895 on ASOCA,
showing superior results. Especially, our geometry-based model generates an
accurate, intact and smooth coronary artery, devoid of any fragmentations of
segmented vessels.

increase in rotational speed significantly increases the thrust of the rotating

that the potential for the application of the rotating magnetic sail is
greatest in orbits with high-density and low-speed space plasma environments.
It suggests that a rotating magnetic sail with a magnetic moment (Mm) of

we study the dependence of the Q factor of SLR from 2D Au nanorod arrays on
nanorod orientation. It is found the Q factor is 112 when the nanorod is lying
perpendicular to the incident plane but gradually increases by more than 13
times to 1460 upon rotating it azimuthally. The increase of the Q factor is due
to the interplay between the coupling strength and the frequency detuning
between the LSP and RA as well as the decay rate of the LSP. By optimizing
these parameters, we can achieve a Q factor reaching over 12000, which is 6
times higher than the best reported so far.

factors in this system. The results show that: (1) The political and economic
environment being not optimistic will limit the enterprise's operating ability,
thus directly leading to the change of the enterprise's asset and liability

stellar explosions. If a WD accretes from stellar wind of a distant evolved
giant in a symbiotic binary, it can undergo occasional outbursts in which it
brightens by several magnitudes, produces a low- and high-velocity
mass-outflow, and, in some cases, ejects bipolar jets. In this paper, we
complement the current picture of these outbursts by the transient emergence of
a neutral region in the orbital plane of symbiotic binaries consisting of wind
from the giant. We prove its presence by determining H$^0$ column densities
($N_{\rm H}$) in the direction of the WD and at any orbital phase of the binary
by modeling the continuum depression around the Ly$\alpha$ line caused by
Rayleigh scattering on atomic hydrogen for all suitable objects, i.e.,
eclipsing symbiotic binaries, for which a well-defined ultraviolet spectrum
from an outburst is available. The $N_{\rm H}$ values follow a common course
along the orbit with a minimum and maximum of a few times $10^{22}$ and
$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$ around the superior and inferior conjunction of the giant,
respectively. Its asymmetry implies an asymmetric density distribution of the
wind from the giant in the orbital plane with respect to the binary axis. The
neutral wind is observable in the orbital plane due to the formation of a dense
disk-like structure around the WD during outbursts, which blocks ionizing
radiation from the central burning WD in the orbital plane.

localization and mapping approaches in such extreme environments. This paper
presents the conception, calibration and implementation of an external

approach, based on an HTC Vive tracking system in air, calculates the
underwater camera pose by fusing the poses of two controllers tracked above the

Finally, the usability of the system for underwater applications is

classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information
of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect
the high-order correlations that already exist between nodes in the AST, which
may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while
a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous
and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural
information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes
and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose to represent AST
as a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) and process the graph by
heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) for code

high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess
heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of

analysis due to its computational efficiency and long-range modeling
capability. Owing to these properties, the Swin Transformer is suitable for
establishing more distant relationships between corresponding voxels in
different positions in complex abdominal image registration tasks. However, the
registration models based on transformers combine multiple voxels into a single
semantic token. This merging process limits the transformers to model and
generate coarse-grained spatial information. To address this issue, we propose
Recovery Feature Resolution Network (RFRNet), which allows the transformer to
contribute fine-grained spatial information and rich semantic correspondences
to higher resolution levels. Furthermore, shifted window partitioning
operations are inflexible, indicating that they cannot perceive the semantic
information over uncertain distances and automatically bridge the global
connections between windows. Therefore, we present a Weighted Window Attention
(WWA) to build global interactions between windows automatically. It is
implemented after the regular and cyclic shift window partitioning operations
within the Swin transformer block. The proposed unsupervised deformable image
registration model, named RFR-WWANet, detects the long-range correlations, and
facilitates meaningful semantic relevance of anatomical structures. Qualitative
and quantitative results show that RFR-WWANet achieves significant improvements
over the current state-of-the-art methods. Ablation experiments demonstrate the

  Retriveal",,,,,"cs.CV cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D cross-modal retrieval is gaining attention in the multimedia community.
Central to this topic is learning a joint embedding space to represent data
from different modalities, such as images, 3D point clouds, and polygon meshes,
to extract modality-invariant and discriminative features. Hence, the
performance of cross-modal retrieval methods heavily depends on the
representational capacity of this embedding space. Existing methods treat all
instances equally, applying the same penalty strength to instances with varying
degrees of difficulty, ignoring the differences between instances. This can
result in ambiguous convergence or local optima, severely compromising the
separability of the feature space. To address this limitation, we propose an
Instance-Variant loss to assign different penalty strengths to different
instances, improving the space separability. Specifically, we assign different
penalty weights to instances positively related to their intra-class distance.
Simultaneously, we reduce the cross-modal discrepancy between features by
learning a shared weight vector for the same class data from different
modalities. By leveraging the Gaussian RBF kernel to evaluate sample
similarity, we further propose an Intra-Class loss function that minimizes the
intra-class distance among same-class instances. Extensive experiments on three
3D cross-modal datasets show that our proposed method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches.

Applications such as answering questions based on a book or summarizing a

Specifically, by exploiting the fact that in many tasks, only a small subset of

we propose a VIP-token centric compression (VCC) scheme which selectively
compresses the sequence based on their impact on approximating the

algorithm is not only efficient (achieving more than $3\times$ efficiency gain

competitive/better performance on a large number of tasks. Further, we show
that our algorithm scales to 128K tokens (or more) while consistently offering

uncertainty in linear elastic stochastic problems. We first derive stochastic
virtual element equations for 2D and 3D linear elastic problems that may
involve uncertainties in material properties, external forces, etc. A
stochastic virtual element space that couples the deterministic virtual element
space and the stochastic space is constructed for this purpose and used to
approximate the unknown stochastic solution. Two numerical frameworks are then
developed to solve the derived stochastic virtual element equations, including
a Polynomial Chaos approximation based approach and a weakly intrusive
approximation based approach. In the PC based framework, the stochastic
solution is approximated using the Polynomial Chaos basis and solved via an
augmented deterministic virtual element equation that is generated by applying
the stochastic Galerkin procedure to the original stochastic virtual element
equation. In the weakly intrusive approximation based framework, the stochastic
solution is approximated by a summation of a set of products of random
variables and deterministic vectors, where the deterministic vectors are solved
via converting the original stochastic problem to deterministic virtual element
equations by the stochastic Galerkin approach, and the random variables are
solved via converting the original stochastic problem to one-dimensional
stochastic algebraic equations by the classical Galerkin procedure. This method
avoids the curse of dimensionality of high-dimensional stochastic problems
successfully since all random inputs are embedded into one-dimensional
stochastic algebraic equations whose computational effort weakly depends on the
stochastic dimension. Numerical results on 2D and 3D problems with low- and
high-dimensional random inputs demonstrate the good performance of the proposed
methods.

Class I methanol masers that are associated with sources that show SiO line
wings are more numerous and stronger than those without such wings. The total
integrated intensity of class I methanol masers is well correlated with the
integrated intensity and velocity coverage of the SiO (2--1) emission. The
properties of class I methanol masers are positively correlated with the
bolometric luminosity, clump mass, peak H$_2$ column density of their
associated clumps but uncorrelated with the luminosity-to-mass ratio, dust
temperature, and mean H$_2$ volume density. We suggest that the properties of
class I masers are related to shocks traced by SiO. Based on our observations,
we conclude that class I methanol masers at 84 and 95 GHz can trace a similar
evolutionary stage as H$_2$O maser, and appear prior to 6.7 and 12.2 GHz
methanol and OH masers. Despite their small number, the 104.3 GHz class I
masers appear to trace a short and more evolved stage compared to the other
class I masers. [abridged]

In this paper, the territory of LASSO is extended to two-layer ReLU neural
networks, a fashionable and powerful nonlinear regression model. Specifically,
given a neural network whose output $y$ depends only on a small subset of input
$\boldsymbol{x}$, denoted by $\mathcal{S}^{\star}$, we prove that the LASSO
estimator can stably reconstruct the neural network and identify
$\mathcal{S}^{\star}$ when the number of samples scales logarithmically with

linear models while barely studied for neural networks. Our theory lies in an
extended Restricted Isometry Property (RIP)-based analysis framework for
two-layer ReLU neural networks, which may be of independent interest to other
LASSO or neural network settings. Based on the result, we advocate a neural
network-based variable selection method. Experiments on simulated and

favorable performance on removing spatially invariant noise. However, many of

Instead of continuously increasing the network depth, many researchers have
revealed that expanding the width of networks can also be a useful way to
improve model performance. It also has been verified that feature filtering can
promote the learning ability of the models. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel Dual-branch Residual Attention Network (DRANet) for image
denoising, which has both the merits of a wide model architecture and
attention-guided feature learning. The proposed DRANet includes two different
parallel branches, which can capture complementary features to enhance the
learning ability of the model. We designed a new residual attention block (RAB)
and a novel hybrid dilated residual attention block (HDRAB) for the upper and
the lower branches, respectively. The RAB and HDRAB can capture rich local
features through multiple skip connections between different convolutional
layers, and the unimportant features are dropped by the residual attention
modules. Meanwhile, the long skip connections in each branch, and the global
feature fusion between the two parallel branches can capture the global
features as well. Moreover, the proposed DRANet uses downsampling operations
and dilated convolutions to increase the size of the receptive field, which can
enable DRANet to capture more image context information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that compared with other state-of-the-art denoising methods, our
DRANet can produce competitive denoising performance both on synthetic and

dynamical phenomena, such as synchronization. While a first-order approximation
of the dynamics on the torus may be appropriate in some situations,
higher-order phase reductions become necessary, for example, when the coupling
strength increases. However, these are generally hard to compute and thus they
have only been derived in special cases: This includes globally coupled
Stuart--Landau oscillators, where the limit cycle of the uncoupled nonlinear
oscillator is circular as the amplitude is independent of the phase. We go
beyond this restriction and derive second-order phase reductions for coupled
oscillators for arbitrary networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators with
phase-dependent amplitude, a scenario more reminiscent of real-world
oscillations. We analyze how the deformation of the limit cycle affects the
stability of important dynamical states, such as full synchrony and splay
states. By identifying higher-order phase interaction terms with hyperedges of
a hypergraph, we obtain natural classes of coupled phase oscillator dynamics on
hypergraphs that adequately capture the dynamics of coupled limit cycle

Wiener filter at the receiver side to perform the tracking, we use the inner
cost function of the said filter as the cost function for the pilot selection.
To obtain this cost function, the phase noise autocorrelation is required.
Therefore, we introduce a new mathematical approximation of the autocorrelation

used for approximating the solution to nonlinear stochastic partial
differential equations (PDEs). For many practical problems of interest,
discretizing these PDEs results in massive matrix differential equations (MDEs)
that are too expensive to solve using conventional methods. While TDB ROMs have
the potential to significantly reduce this computational burden, they still
suffer from the following challenges: (i) inefficient for general
nonlinearities, (ii) intrusive implementation, (iii) ill-conditioned in the
presence of small singular values, and (iv) error accumulation due to fixed
rank. To this end, we present a scalable method for solving TDB ROMs that is
computationally efficient, minimally intrusive, robust in the presence of small
singular values, rank-adaptive, and highly parallelizable. These favorable
properties are achieved via low-rank approximation of the time discrete MDE.
Using the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a low-rank CUR
decomposition is computed at each iteration of the time stepping scheme,
enabling a near-optimal approximation at a fraction of the cost. We also

  Platoons: Diverse Sparsities Inspired Approaches","This manuscript has been accepted for publication in IEEE JSAC",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the employment of reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs) into vehicle platoons, functioning in tandem with a base
station (BS) in support of the high-precision location tracking. In particular,
the use of a RIS imposes additional structured sparsity that, when paired with
the initial sparse line-of-sight (LoS) channels of the BS, facilitates
beneficial group sparsity. The resultant group sparsity significantly enriches
the energies of the original direct-only channel, enabling a greater
concentration of the LoS channel energies emanated from the same vehicle
location index. Furthermore, the burst sparsity is exposed by representing the
non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channels as their sparse copies. This thus constitutes
the philosophy of the diverse sparsities of interest. Then, a diverse dynamic
layered structured sparsity (DiLuS) framework is customized for capturing
different priors for this pair of sparsities, based upon which the location
tracking problem is formulated as a maximum a posterior (MAP) estimate of the
location. Nevertheless, the tracking issue is highly intractable due to the
ill-conditioned sensing matrix, intricately coupled latent variables associated
with the BS and RIS, and the spatialtemporal correlations among the vehicle
platoon. To circumvent these hurdles, we propose an efficient algorithm, namely
DiLuS enabled spatial-temporal platoon localization (DiLuS-STPL), which
incorporates both variational Bayesian inference (VBI) and message passing
techniques for recursively achieving parameter updates in a turbo-like way.
Finally, we demonstrate through extensive simulation results that the
localization relying exclusively upon a BS and a RIS may achieve the comparable
precision performance obtained by the two individual BSs, along with the
robustness and superiority of our proposed algorithm as compared to various
benchmark schemes.

basic shadowing mechanism behind the characteristic microstructure and porosity
of the ZnO thin films, relating them to an enhanced piezoelectric response to
periodic and random inputs. The piezoelectric devices are assembled by
embedding the ZnO films in PMMA and using Au electrodes in two different
configurations: laterally and vertically contacted devices. We present the
response of the laterally connected devices as a force sensor for low-frequency
events with different answers to the applied force depending on the impedance
circuit, i.e. load values range, a behaviour that is theoretically analyzed.
The vertical devices reach power densities as high as 0.27 microW/cm2. We
analyze their actual-scenario performance by activation with a fan and

considered, irrespective of the TM. In terms of voltages, we find the Co- and
Ti-based compositions to exhibit the highest (4.59 V vs. K) and lowest (2.24 V)

of the prismatic coordination environment of K compared to octahedral
coordination at the K$_{0.5}$TMO$_2$ compositions using Rouxel and cationic

find P3-K$_x$CoO$_2$ to be the most promising cathode composition, while
P3-K$_x$NiO$_2$ is worth exploring. Our work should contribute to the

internal attributes can become critical if their measurements assume anomalous

qualitative study investigates the developers' perception of the relevance of
critical internal attributes when evolving features. We target six class-level
critical attributes: low cohesion, high complexity, high coupling, large
hierarchy depth, large hierarchy breadth, and large size. We performed two
industrial case studies based on online focus group sessions. Developers
discussed how much (and why) critical attributes are relevant when adding or
enhancing features. We assessed the relevance of critical attributes
individually and relatively, the reasons behind the relevance of each critical
attribute, and the interrelations of critical attributes. Low cohesion and high
complexity were perceived as very relevant because they often make evolving
features hard while tracking failures and adding features. The other critical
attributes were perceived as less relevant when reusing code or adopting design
patterns. An example of perceived interrelation is high complexity leading to
high coupling.

  Fading Channels","13 pages, 9 figures","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 2023",,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we investigate the performance of multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels assisted by a reconfigurable intelligent
surface (RIS), through the employment of partition-based RIS schemes. The
proposed schemes are implemented without requiring any channel state
information knowledge at the transmitter side; this characteristic makes them
attractive for practical applications. In particular, the RIS elements are
partitioned into sub-surfaces, which are periodically modified in an efficient
way to assist the communication. Under this framework, we propose two
low-complexity partition-based schemes, where each sub-surface is adjusted by
following an amplitude-based or a phase-based approach. Specifically, the
activate-reflect (AR) scheme activates each sub-surface consecutively, by
changing the reflection amplitude of the corresponding elements. On the other
hand, the flip-reflect (FR) scheme adjusts periodically the phase shift of the
elements at each sub-surface. Through the sequential reconfiguration of each
sub-surface, an equivalent parallel channel in the time domain is produced. We
analyze the performance of each scheme in terms of outage probability and
provide expressions for the achieved diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Our
results show that the asymptotic performance of the considered network under
the partition-based schemes can be significantly enhanced in terms of diversity
gain compared to the conventional case, where a single partition is considered.
Moreover, the FR scheme always achieves the maximum multiplexing gain, while
for the AR scheme this maximum gain can be achieved only under certain
conditions with respect to the number of elements in each sub-surface.

charge value and crossing a flat interface between two media. Both media are
homogeneous, stationary, and isotropic. They may have frequency dispersion but
no spatial dispersion. Cherenkov radiation can be generated in the second
medium only. It is assumed that the bunch charge value decreases exponentially
starting from some time moment after the charge enters the second medium. This
means that we take into account the scatter of the particle path lengths,
connected with a statistical nature of energy losses of particles. It is taken
into account that the filamentous trace consisting of immobile charges is
formed in the second medium.
  We obtain the general solution of the problem. The asymptotic study for the
wave zone is carried out. We obtain expressions for the spherical wave as well
as for the cylindrical wave generated in the second medium if the charge
velocity is sufficiently high. The main properties of radiation are described.
If the process of the bunch decay starts from the boundary between media, then
the angular distribution of the radiation energy has the single maximum in each
from two regions. In the second medium, the radiation, as a rule, is greater
than in the vacuum area, and this difference increases with increasing the
charge velocity. If the charge velocity is higher than the speed of light in
the second medium, then, along with appearance of Cherenkov radiation, the
properties of spherical wave change radically. In particular, the main maximum
of the angular distribution of the radiation energy increases sharply. If the
distance from the charge entry point to the region of the bunch decay is
sufficiently large, then the complex interference pattern with many extrema
take place.

the elastic far-fields, with a single incident direction, measured before and
after injecting highly dense small scaled inclusions. We take as a model, the
Lam\'e system where the mass density is the unknown and the Lam\'e parameters
are kept as known constants. The injected small/dense inclusion, $D:=z +a B$
with $z$ as its location, $a\ll 1$ as its maximum radius and $B$ of unit
volume, generates a sequences of resonant frequencies. These special
frequencies are related to the eigenvalues of the Lam\'e volume integral
operator defined on the domain of the inclusion. Therefore, these resonant
frequencies are, in principle, computable. After injecting the small inclusion
at a location point $z$, we send an elastic incident plane wave at an incident
frequency close to one of the mentioned resonant frequencies, say
$\omega_{n_0}$. Contrasting the farfields generated, at one incident direction,
before and after injecting this small inclusion, we provide an explicit formula
that allows us to recover the quantity $G^{\omega}(z,x)\cdot
\int_{B}e_{n_0}^B(\eta)\,d\eta$ where $G^\omega(z,x)$ is the Green's tensor of
the medium, in the absence of the inclusion, and $e_{n_0}^B(\cdot)$ are the
eigenfunctions corresponding to the chosen eigenvalue (which is not necessarily
a simple eigenvalue) of the Lam\'e volume integral operator stated on the
scaled domain $B$. Here $x$ is outside of the domain of interest $\Omega$ and
$z \in \Omega$. Then we repeat the experiment by moving the inclusion's
location $z$ inside $\Omega$. Finally, using this reconstructed field in the

This methodology adopts a novel reparametrization for generation of

constructs multiple levels of progressively coarser hypergraphs that are used
to drive cut refinement on each level of the hierarchy. Multilevel partitioners
are subject to two limitations: (i) hypergraph coarsening processes rely on
local neighborhood structure without fully considering the global structure of
the hypergraph; and (ii) refinement heuristics risk entrapment in local minima.
In this paper, we describe K-SpecPart, a supervised spectral framework for
multi-way partitioning that directly tackles these two limitations. K-SpecPart
relies on the computation of generalized eigenvectors and supervised
dimensionality reduction techniques to generate vertex embeddings. These are
computational primitives that are fast and capture global structural properties
of the hypergraph that are not explicitly considered by existing partitioners.
K-SpecPart then converts the vertex embeddings into multiple partitioning
solutions. K-SpecPart introduces the idea of ''ensembling'' multiple solutions
via a cut-overlay clustering technique that often enables the use of
computationally demanding partitioning methods such as ILP (integer linear
programming). Using the output of a standard partitioner as a supervision hint,
K-SpecPart effectively combines the strengths of established multilevel
partitioning techniques with the benefits of spectral graph theory and other
combinatorial algorithms. K-SpecPart significantly extends ideas and algorithms
that first appeared in our previous work on the bipartitioner SpecPart. Our
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of K-SpecPart. For bipartitioning,
K-SpecPart produces solutions with up to 15% cutsize improvement over SpecPart.
For multi-way partitioning, K-SpecPart produces solutions with up to 20%
cutsize improvement over leading partitioners hMETIS and KaHyPar.

  with Label-adaptive Mixup","Accepted to ICASSP 2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is to recognize human emotions in a natural
verbal interaction scenario with machines, which is considered as a challenging
problem due to the ambiguous human emotions. Despite the recent progress in
SER, state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve a satisfactory performance. We
propose a self-attention based method with combined use of label-adaptive mixup
and center loss. By adapting label probabilities in mixup and fitting center
loss to the mixup training scheme, our proposed method achieves a superior
performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

problems in ITS for some time. This paper proposes a new model for VRGS, which
takes into consideration of the information propagation, user selection and
information reaction. Parameter p is then defined as the updating weight for
computing cost of traffic based on a distributive learning scheme. p is
calculated through a function which denotes information propagation over time

traffic assignment, DTA and feasible strategies are given, and future work is
also stated.

  Attacks against Deep Image Classification","Preprint",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep image classification models trained on large amounts of web-scraped data
are vulnerable to data poisoning, a mechanism for backdooring models. Even a
few poisoned samples seen during training can entirely undermine the model's
integrity during inference. While it is known that poisoning more samples
enhances an attack's effectiveness and robustness, it is unknown whether
poisoning too many samples weakens an attack by making it more detectable. We
observe a fundamental detectability/robustness trade-off in data poisoning
attacks: Poisoning too few samples renders an attack ineffective and not
robust, but poisoning too many samples makes it detectable. This raises the bar
for data poisoning attackers who have to balance this trade-off to remain
robust and undetectable. Our work proposes two defenses designed to (i) detect
and (ii) repair poisoned models as a post-processing step after training using
a limited amount of trusted image-label pairs. We show that our defenses
mitigate all surveyed attacks and outperform existing defenses using less
trusted data to repair a model. Our defense scales to joint vision-language
models, such as CLIP, and interestingly, we find that attacks on larger models
are more easily detectable but also more robust than those on smaller models.
Lastly, we propose two adaptive attacks demonstrating that while our work
raises the bar for data poisoning attacks, it cannot mitigate all forms of
backdooring.

  intelligence across 32 university courses","17 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emergence of large language models has led to the development of powerful
tools such as ChatGPT that can produce text indistinguishable from
human-generated work. With the increasing accessibility of such technology,
students across the globe may utilize it to help with their school work -- a
possibility that has sparked discussions on the integrity of student
evaluations in the age of artificial intelligence (AI). To date, it is unclear
how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses.
Further, students' perspectives regarding the use of such tools, and educators'
perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we
compare the performance of ChatGPT against students on 32 university-level
courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two
classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a
survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors'
institution, to discern students' and educators' perceptions of ChatGPT's use.
We find that ChatGPT's performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of
students in many courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably
detect ChatGPT's use in school work, due to their propensity to classify
human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the ease with which
AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, we find an
emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat
this as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy
discussions addressing the integration of AI into educational frameworks.

coordination, hastening the robustness of multi-agent communication when
policies are deployed in a message perturbation environment. Major relevant
works tackle this issue under specific assumptions, like a limited number of
message channels would sustain perturbations, limiting the efficiency in
complex scenarios. In this paper, we take a further step addressing this issue
by learning a robust multi-agent communication policy via multi-view message
certification, dubbed CroMAC. Agents trained under CroMAC can obtain guaranteed
lower bounds on state-action values to identify and choose the optimal action
under a worst-case deviation when the received messages are perturbed.
Concretely, we first model multi-agent communication as a multi-view problem,
where every message stands for a view of the state. Then we extract a
certificated joint message representation by a multi-view variational
autoencoder (MVAE) that uses a product-of-experts inference network. For the
optimization phase, we do perturbations in the latent space of the state for a
certificate guarantee. Then the learned joint message representation is used to
approximate the certificated state representation during training. Extensive
experiments in several cooperative multi-agent benchmarks validate the
effectiveness of the proposed CroMAC.

  Contextualization",,,,,"cs.MA cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has attracted
significant attention and played the potential for many real-world
applications. Previous arts mainly focus on facilitating the coordination
ability from different aspects (e.g., non-stationarity, credit assignment) in
single-task or multi-task scenarios, ignoring the stream of tasks that appear
in a continual manner. This ignorance makes the continual coordination an
unexplored territory, neither in problem formulation nor efficient algorithms
designed. Towards tackling the mentioned issue, this paper proposes an approach
Multi-Agent Continual Coordination via Progressive Task Contextualization,
dubbed MACPro. The key point lies in obtaining a factorized policy, using
shared feature extraction layers but separated independent task heads, each
specializing in a specific class of tasks. The task heads can be progressively
expanded based on the learned task contextualization. Moreover, to cater to the
popular CTDE paradigm in MARL, each agent learns to predict and adopt the most
relevant policy head based on local information in a decentralized manner. We
show in multiple multi-agent benchmarks that existing continual learning
methods fail, while MACPro is able to achieve close-to-optimal performance.
More results also disclose the effectiveness of MACPro from multiple aspects
like high generalization ability.

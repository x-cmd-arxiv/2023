cubic-quintic nonlinear Ginzburg-Landau equation (CQGLE). Solutions in the
closed analytical form in the spectral domain have the shape of Rayleigh-Jeans
distribution for a purely real quintic nonlinearity. The DS parametric space
forms a two-dimensional (or three-dimensional for the complex quintic
nonlinearity) master diagram connecting the DS energy and a universal parameter
formed by the ratio of four real and imaginary coefficients for dissipative and
non-dissipative terms in CQGLE. The concept of dissipative soliton resonance
(DSR) is formulated in terms of the master diagram, and the main signatures of
transition to DSR are demonstrated and experimentally verified. We show a close
analogy between DS and incoherent (semicoherent) solitons with an ensemble of
quasi-particles confined by a collective potential. It allows applying the
thermodynamical approach to DS and deriving the conditions for the DS energy
scalability.

chronic diseases, achieving fitness goals, and improving overall health and

time-consuming, hence limiting utility and adoption. Prior work has used
wearable sensors for EEE as a workaround. Moreover, earables (ear-worn sensing
devices such as earbuds) have recently emerged as a sub-category of wearables
with unique characteristics (i.e., small form factor, high adoption) and
positioning on the human body (i.e., robust to motion, high stability, facing
thin skin), opening up a novel sensing opportunity. However, earables with
multimodal sensors have rarely been used for EEE, with data collected in
multiple activity types. Further, it is unknown how earable sensors perform
compared to standard wearable sensors worn on other body positions. In this
study, using a publicly available dataset gathered from 17 participants, we
evaluate the EEE performance using multimodal sensors of earable devices to
show that an MAE of 0.5 MET (RMSE = 0.67) can be achieved. Furthermore, we
compare the EEE performance of three commercial wearable devices with the
earable, demonstrating competitive performance of earables

combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning to iteratively improve
mesh quality. First, we generate different initial boundaries by randomly
sampling points in a square domain and connecting them sequentially. These
boundaries are used for obtaining input meshes and extracting training datasets
in the supervised learning module. We then iteratively improve the
reinforcement learning model performance with reward functions designed for
special requirements, such as improving the mesh quality and controlling the

automatically generate high-quality quadrilateral meshes for complex planar

as a novel feature of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. As a key driver,
millimeterwave (mmWave) communication largely boosts speed, capacities, and
connectivity. In order to maximize the potential of mmWave communication,
precise and fast beam acquisition (BA) is crucial, since it compensates for a
high pathloss and provides a large beamforming gain. Practically, the
angle-of-departure (AoD) remains almost constant over numerous consecutive time
slots, the backscatter signal experiences some delay, and the hardware is
restricted under the peak power constraint. This work captures these main
features by a simple binary beam-pointing (BBP) channel model with in-block
memory (iBM) [1], peak cost constraint, and one unit-delayed feedback. In
particular, we focus on the sensing capabilities of such a model and
characterize the performance of the BA process in terms of the Hamming
distortion of the estimated channel state. We encode the position of the AoD
and derive the minimum distortion of the BBP channel under the peak cost
constraint with no communication constraint. Our previous work [2] proposed a
joint communication and sensing (JCAS) algorithm, which achieves the capacity
of the same channel model. Herein, we show that by employing this JCAS
transmission strategy, optimal data communication and channel estimation can be
accomplished simultaneously. This yields the complete characterization of the
capacity-distortion tradeoff for this model.

  Quantum Sensing",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Error correction has long been suggested to extend the sensitivity of quantum
sensors into the Heisenberg Limit. However, operations on logical qubits are
only performed through universal gate sets consisting of finite-sized gates
such as Clifford+T. Although these logical gate sets allow for universal
quantum computation, the finite gate sizes present a problem for quantum
sensing, since in sensing protocols, such as the Ramsey measurement protocol,
the signal must act continuously. The difficulty in constructing a continuous
logical operator comes from the Eastin-Knill theorem, which prevents a
continuous signal from being both fault tolerant to local errors and
transverse. Since error correction is needed to approach the Heisenberg Limit
in a noisy environment, it is important to explore how to construct
fault-tolerant continuous operators. In this paper, a protocol to design
continuous logical z-rotations is proposed and applied to the Steane Code. The
fault tolerance of the designed operator is investigated using the
Knill-Laflamme conditions. The Knill-Laflamme conditions indicate that the
diagonal unitary operator constructed cannot be fault tolerant solely due to
the possibilities of X errors on the middle qubit. The approach demonstrated
throughout this paper may, however, find success in codes with more qubits such
as the Shor code, distance 3 surface code, [15,1,3] code, or codes with a
larger distance such as the [11,1,5] code.

quenched, when one is excited while the other is quenched and vice versa, when
$ \rm ND_3 $ state changes its parity while $ \rm D_2 $ is excited or quenched,
and when $ \rm ND_3 $ is excited or quenched while $ \rm D_2 $ remains in the

a set of sixteen state-to-state transitions available from literature for

through a two-step mechanism in which the kinetic energy of molecule-molecule

partially observable Markov decision process (PL-POMDP) problem and use linear
temporal logic (LTL) to express the complex task. The LTL formula is then
converted to a limit-deterministic generalized B\""uchi automaton (LDGBA). The
problem is redefined as finding an optimal policy on the product of PL-POMDP
with LDGBA based on model-checking techniques to satisfy the complex task. We
implement deep Q learning with long short-term memory (LSTM) to process the
observation history and task recognition. Our contributions include the
proposed method, the utilization of LTL and LDGBA, and the LSTM-enhanced deep Q
learning. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method by conducting
simulations in various environments, including grid worlds, a virtual office,

proposed method effectively addresses environment, action, and observation
uncertainties. This indicates its potential for real-world applications,

narrow-banded optical filters. Atomic filters come in two flavors: a filter
based on the absorption of light by the Doppler broadened atomic vapor, i.e., a
notch filter, and a bandpass filter based on the transmission of resonant light
caused by the Faraday effect. The notch filter uses the absorption of resonant
photons to filter out a small spectral band around the atomic transition. The
off-resonant part of the spectrum is fully transmitted. Atomic vapors based on
the Faraday effect allow for suppression of the detuned spectral fraction.
Transmission of light originates from the magnetically induced rotation of
linear polarized light close to an atomic resonance. This filter constellation
allows selective acceptance of specific light frequencies. In this manuscript,
we discuss these two types of filters and elucidate the specialties of atomic
line filters. We also present a practical guide on building such filter setups

\""Oktem and Sch\""onlieb. We show that the effect of their restoration method on
the distribution of the images is an explicit Euler discretization of a

Wasserstein ROF (WROF), is the corresponding implicit discretization. We obtain
our geometric characterisation of the solution in this setting by first proving
a more general convex analysis theorem for variational problems with solutions
characterised by projections. We then use optimal transport arguments to obtain
our WROF theorem from this general result, as well as a decomposition of a

approximations to the target distribution that match it up to finer and finer
scales. These algorithms are in complete analogy to well-known effective
methods based on ROF for iterative denoising, respectively hierarchical image

often learn knowledge from enormous data implicitly and cannot utilize

approaches such as graph neural networks (GNNs) that integrate prior
information can barely compete with Transformer models. In this work, we aim to
benefit from both worlds and propose a novel Multimodal Graph Transformer for
question answering tasks that requires performing reasoning across multiple
modalities. We introduce a graph-involved plug-and-play quasi-attention
mechanism to incorporate multimodal graph information, acquired from text and
visual data, to the vanilla self-attention as effective prior. In particular,
we construct the text graph, dense region graph, and semantic graph to generate
adjacency matrices, and then compose them with input vision and language
features to perform downstream reasoning. Such a way of regularizing
self-attention with graph information significantly improves the inferring
ability and helps align features from different modalities. We validate the
effectiveness of Multimodal Graph Transformer over its Transformer baselines on
GQA, VQAv2, and MultiModalQA datasets.

study a mathematical model of influence battle of three currencies, namely, the
US dollar, the euro, and such a hypothetical BRICS currency. In this model, a
country trade preference for one of the three currencies is determined by a
multiplicative factor based on trade flows between countries and their relative
weights in the global international trade. The three currency seed groups are
formed by 9 eurozone countries for the euro, 5 Anglo-Saxon countries for the US
dollar and the 5 BRICS countries for the new proposed currency. The countries
belonging to these 3 currency seed groups trade only with their own associated
currency whereas the other countries choose their preferred trade currency as a
function of the trade relations with their commercial partners. The trade
currency preferences of countries are determined on the basis of a Monte Carlo
modeling of Ising type interactions in magnetic spin systems commonly used to
model opinion formation in social networks. We adapt here these models to the
world trade network analysis. The results obtained from our mathematical
modeling of the structure of the global trade network show that as early as
2012 about 58 percent of countries would have preferred to trade with the BRICS
currency, 23 percent with the euro and 19 percent with the US dollar. Our

inspiration from the encoding of information in biological organisms. Instead
of learning a separate latent vector for each sample, we split the latent space

Thus, by independently sampling a variant for each gene and combining them into
the final latent vector, our approach can represent a vast number of unique

the properties of circumgalactic gas that result from accretion and feedback

nuclei (AGN) jet feedback as implemented in SIMBA, which quenches galaxies and
has a dramatic effect on large-scale gas properties. We show that jet feedback
at low redshifts is most common in the stellar mass range $(1-5)\times
10^{10}M_\odot$, so we focus on galaxies with active jets in this mass range.
In comparison to runs without jet feedback, jets cause lower densities and
higher temperatures along the galaxy minor axis (SIMBA jet direction) at radii
>=$0.5r_{200c}-4r_{200c}$ and beyond. This effect is less apparent at higher or
lower stellar masses, and is strongest within green valley galaxies. The
metallicity also shows strong anisotropy out to large scales, driven by star
formation feedback. We find substantially stronger anisotropy at
<=$0.5r_{200c}$, but this also exists in runs with no explicit feedback,
suggesting that it is due to anisotropic accretion. Finally, we explore
anisotropy in the bulk radial motion of the gas, finding that both star
formation and AGN wind feedback contribute to pushing the gas outwards along
the minor axis at <=1 Mpc, but AGN jet feedback further causes bulk outflow
along the minor axis out to several Mpc, which drives quenching via gas
starvation. These results provide observational signatures for the operation of
AGN feedback in galaxy quenching.

extractors, surpassing traditional convolution-based models in various
scenarios. However, the success of vision transformers largely owes to their
capacity to accommodate numerous parameters. As a result, new challenges for
adapting large models to downstream tasks arise. On the one hand, classic
fine-tuning tunes all parameters in a huge model for every task and thus easily
falls into overfitting, leading to inferior performance. On the other hand, on
resource-limited devices, fine-tuning stores a full copy of parameters and thus
is usually impracticable for the shortage of storage space. However, few works
have focused on how to efficiently and effectively transfer knowledge in a
vision transformer. Existing methods did not dive into the properties of visual
features, leading to inferior performance. Moreover, some of them bring heavy
inference cost though benefiting storage. To tackle these problems, we propose
consolidator to modify the pre-trained model with the addition of a small set
of tunable parameters to temporarily store the task-specific knowledge while
freezing the backbone model. Motivated by the success of group-wise
convolution, we adopt grouped connections across the features extracted by
fully connected layers to construct tunable parts in a consolidator. To further
enhance the model's capacity to transfer knowledge under a constrained storage
budget and keep inference efficient, we consolidate the parameters in two
stages: 1. between adaptation and storage, and 2. between loading and
inference. On a series of downstream visual tasks, our consolidator can reach
up to 7.56 better accuracy than full fine-tuning with merely 0.35% parameters,
and outperform state-of-the-art parameter-efficient tuning methods by a clear
margin. Code is available at https://github.com/beyondhtx/Consolidator.

administered a pre-semester survey of preferences, coded video recordings of

  Approach for Mitigating Depolarizing and Decoherence Noise",,,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quantum computers in the NISQ era are prone to noise. A range of quantum
error mitigation techniques has been proposed to address this issue. Zero-noise
extrapolation (ZNE) stands out as a promising one. ZNE involves increasing the
noise levels in a circuit and then using extrapolation to infer the zero noise
case from the noisy results obtained. This paper presents a novel ZNE approach
that does not require circuit folding or noise scaling to mitigate depolarizing
and/or decoherence noise.
  To mitigate depolarizing noise, we propose leveraging the extreme/infinite
noisy case, which allows us to avoid circuit folding. Specifically, the circuit
output with extreme noise becomes the maximally mixed state. We show that using
circuit-reliability metrics, simple linear extrapolation can effectively
mitigate depolarizing noise. With decoherence noise, different states decay
into the all-zero state at a rate that depends on the number of excited states
and time. Therefore, we propose a state- and latency-aware exponential
extrapolation that does not involve folding or scaling. When dealing with a
quantum system affected by both decoherence and depolarizing noise, we propose
to use our two mitigation techniques in sequence: first applying decoherence
error mitigation, followed by depolarizing error mitigation.
  A common limitation of ZNE schemes is that if the circuit of interest suffers
from high noise, scaling-up noise levels could not provide useful data for
extrapolation. We propose using circuit-cut techniques to break a large quantum
circuit into smaller sub-circuits to overcome this limitation. This way, the

self-supervised learning framework for extracting rich and versatile data
representations. Broadly speaking, contrastive learning relies on a data
augmentation scheme to generate two versions of the input data and learns
low-dimensional representations by maximizing a normalized temperature-scaled
cross entropy loss (NT-Xent) to identify augmented samples corresponding to the
same original entity. In this paper, we investigate the potential of deploying
contrastive learning in combination with Graph Neural Networks for embedding
nodes in a graph. Specifically, we show that the quality of the resulting
embeddings and training time can be significantly improved by a simple
column-wise postprocessing of the embedding matrix, instead of the row-wise
postprocessing via multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) that is adopted by the
majority of peer methods. This modification yields improvements in downstream
classification tasks of up to 1.5% and even beats existing state-of-the-art
approaches on 6 out of 8 different benchmarks. We justify our choices of
postprocessing by revisiting the ""alignment vs. uniformity paradigm"", and show
that column-wise post-processing improves both ""alignment"" and ""uniformity"" of
the embeddings.

the initial hole filling to generate a completed output mesh. Specifically, we
train the GCNs to deform an oversmoothed version of the input mesh into the

displacements, despite the unknown correct displacements at real holes, we
utilize multiple sets of meshes with several connected regions marked as fake

enabling network training with loss functions that assess the accuracy of

to eliminate them in favor of Bayesian analyses. Defenders of the p-values have
countered that it is the improper use and errors in interpretation, rather than
the p-values themselves that are to blame. Similar exchanges about the role of
p-values have occurred with some regularity every 10 to 15 years since their
formal introduction in statistical practice. The apparent contradiction between
the repeated failures in interpretation and continuous use of p-values suggest
that there is an inferential value in the computation of these values. In this
work we propose to attach a radical Bayesian interpretation to the number
computed and reported as a p-value for the Generalized Linear Model, which has
been the workhorse of applied statistical work. We introduce a decision
analytic framework for thresholding posterior tail areas (pi-values) which for
any given Bayesian analysis will have a direct correspondence to p-values in
non-Bayesian approaches. Pi-values are non-controversial, posterior probability
summaries of treatment effects. A predictive probability argument is made to
justify the exploration of the stochastic variation (replication probability)
of p and pi-values and culminates into a concrete proposal for the synthesis of
Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to data analyses that aim for
reproducibility. We illustrate these concepts using the results of recent
randomized controlled trials in cardiometabolic and kidney diseases and provide

term usually is considered in the literature as the simplest one. However, we
found in the literature at least two different approaches for the centrifugal
potential. To see the effect of using these different prescriptions, we
evaluate the capture cross sections using the standard quantum-mechanical
formula with the transmission coefficients calculated within the
quasi-classical approximation. For the Coulomb- and strong nuclear terms we
apply the semi-microscopical double-folding model with the effective
nucleon-nucleon forces of Yukawa type. For the nucleon densities the two
parameter Fermi formula is used with the parameters from the IAEA data base.
Our calculations show that the two approaches for the centrifugal potential
result in theoretical capture cross sections which are 20-40 percent different.

versatility, speed, and interpretability. However, for privacy-sensitive
applications, outsourcing DT training and inference to cloud platforms raise
concerns about data privacy. Researchers have developed privacy-preserving
approaches for DT training and inference using cryptographic primitives, such
as Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). While these approaches have shown
progress, they still suffer from heavy computation and communication overheads.
Few recent works employ Graphical Processing Units (GPU) to improve the
performance of MPC-protected deep learning. This raises a natural question:
\textit{can MPC-protected DT training and inference be accelerated by GPU?}
  We present GTree, the first scheme that uses GPU to accelerate MPC-protected
secure DT training and inference. GTree is built across 3 parties who securely
and jointly perform each step of DT training and inference with GPU. Each MPC
protocol in GTree is designed in a GPU-friendly version. The performance
evaluation shows that GTree achieves ${\thicksim}11{\times}$ and
${\thicksim}21{\times}$ improvements in training SPECT and Adult datasets,
compared to the prior most efficient CPU-based work. For inference, GTree shows
its superior efficiency when the DT has less than 10 levels, which is
$126\times$ faster than the prior most efficient work when inferring $10^4$
instances with a tree of 7 levels. GTree also achieves a stronger security
guarantee than prior solutions, which only leaks the tree depth and size of
data samples while prior solutions also leak the tree structure. With
\textit{oblivious array access}, the access pattern on GPU is also protected.

have a strong incentive to extend our work to investigate the possible compact
configuration of a pentaquark $udcc\bar{s}$, which is related to the structure
of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}$. Since the introduction of a complete
set of 3-dimensional harmonic oscillator bases to a spatial wave function in
solving a quark model-based Hamiltonian with variational method leads to a more
accurate value of the mass, it seems natural that future studies of the
pentaquark should be treated with the same elaborate technical approach. To
attain such precision for the ground state energy, we utilize a complete set of
3-dimensional harmonic oscillator base up to 6th quanta. Before carrying out
this process, one important thing that has to be taken into account is to find
out the color $\otimes$ spin states of the pentaquark for the evaluation of
color and spin interaction most essential to the quark model configuration. To
easily identify the suitable configuration, we make a systematic analysis of
$SU(6)_{CS}$ irreducible representation of the pentaquark, from which we find
that there is a correspondence between the color $\otimes$ spin states obtained
from their coupling scheme and the multiplet of the $SU(6)_{CS}$ irreducible
representation of the pentaquark. We find that the energy of the pentaquark
configuration is +18.5 MeV above the lowest threshold for decay into $\Xi_{cc}$
and $K$, suggesting that this configuration is not stable against its decay.
Nonetheless, while we used a Gaussian hyperfine potential, it was recently
found that a Yukawa form leads to a stronger attraction for the $T_{cc}$
configuration. Therefore it is important to study the same configuration using
the latter potential.

that the circularly-polarized probe pulse with a given helicity can selectively
observe the transient conductivity modulated by DFKE in each valley. The
transient conductivity and excitation probability around each valley oscillate
with the pump field frequency $\Omega$. The phases of the $\Omega$ oscillation
for the $K$ and $K'$ valleys are opposite to each other. Furthermore, the
pump-driven DFKE alters the absorption rate of WSe$_2$ monolayer and yields the

domains, ranging from transportation networks to e-commerce networks, from
neuroscience to finance. To date, the vast majority of existing works assume
both source and target domains are sampled from a universal and stationary
distribution. However, many real-world systems are intrinsically dynamic, where
the underlying domains are evolving over time. To bridge the gap, we propose to
shift the problem to the dynamic setting and ask: given the label-rich source
graphs and the label-scarce target graphs observed in previous T timestamps,
how can we effectively characterize the evolving domain discrepancy and
optimize the generalization performance of the target domain at the incoming
T+1 timestamp? To answer the question, for the first time, we propose a
generalization bound under the setting of dynamic transfer learning across
graphs, which implies the generalization performance is dominated by domain
evolution and domain discrepancy between source and target domains. Inspired by
the theoretical results, we propose a novel generic framework DyTrans to
improve knowledge transferability across dynamic graphs. In particular, we
start with a transformer-based temporal encoding module to model temporal
information of the evolving domains; then, we further design a dynamic domain
unification module to efficiently learn domain-invariant representations across
the source and target domains. Finally, extensive experiments on various
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DyTrans in transferring
knowledge from dynamic source domains to dynamic target domains.

for skeleton-based action recognition. This paper proposes an attention-based
contrastive learning framework for skeleton representation learning, called
SkeAttnCLR, which integrates local similarity and global features for
skeleton-based action representations. To achieve this, a multi-head attention
mask module is employed to learn the soft attention mask features from the
skeletons, suppressing non-salient local features while accentuating local
salient features, thereby bringing similar local features closer in the feature
space. Additionally, ample contrastive pairs are generated by expanding
contrastive pairs based on salient and non-salient features with global
features, which guide the network to learn the semantic representations of the
entire skeleton. Therefore, with the attention mask mechanism, SkeAttnCLR
learns local features under different data augmentation views. The experiment
results demonstrate that the inclusion of local feature similarity
significantly enhances skeleton-based action representation. Our proposed
SkeAttnCLR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on NTURGB+D, NTU120-RGB+D, and

lets the RISnet find an optimized RIS configuration by itself. Numerical

mass. Flavor mixing for quarks is mediated by the square-root mass eigenstates,
and the mass ratios used have been derived in earlier work from a left-right
symmetric extension of the standard model. This permits a construction of the
CKM matrix from first principles. There exist only four normed division
algebras, they can be listed as follows - the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, the
complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, the quaternions $\mathbb{H}$ and the octonions
$\mathbb{O}$. The first three algebras are fairly well known; however,
octonions as algebra are less studied. Recent research has pointed towards the
importance of octonions in the study of high energy physics. Clifford algebras
and the standard model are being studied closely. The main advantage of this
approach is that the spinor representations of the fundamental fermions can be
constructed easily here as the left ideals of the algebra. Also the action of
various Spin Groups on these representations too can be studied easily. In this

following a Patch Rotate Module (PRM) to exchange spatial information between

probability of the Dynamic Channel Selection Module (DCSM), and our proposed
patch rotate operation is only performed on the rotated part. Extensive
experiments on ADE20K, Cityscapes and COCO-Stuff 10K datasets prove the
effectiveness of our approach. We expect that our PRSeg can promote the

a new type of method to obtain the complex modulus, which transforms the
microscopic motion of probes to the complex modulus through the generalized
Stokes relation (GSR). Although microrheology has been applied to jammed soft
materials, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, the
validity of the GSR near the jamming transition is far from obvious since there
is a diverging length scale $l_c$, which characterizes the heterogeneous
response of jammed particles. Here, we study the microrheology of jammed
particles by theory and numerical simulation. First, we develop a linear
response formalism to calculate the response function of the probe particle,
which is transformed to the complex modulus via the GSR. Then, we apply our
formalism to a numerical model of jammed particles and find that the storage
and loss modulus follow characteristic scaling laws near the jamming

macrorheology, which indicates that the GSR holds even near the jamming

challenges severely impede the implementation of CAV networks for immersive
metaverse applications and driving safety in future 6G wireless networks. To
alleviate these issues, integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is
envisioned as a game-changing technology for future CAV networks. This article
presents a comprehensive overview on the application of ISAC techniques in
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. We cover the general system
framework, representative advances, and a detailed case study on using the 5G
New Radio (NR) waveform for sensing-assisted communications in V2I networks.
Finally, we highlight open problems and opportunities in the field.

is to understand what structural conditions and algorithmic principles lead to
sample-efficient learning guarantees, and how these considerations change as we
move from few to many agents. We study this question in a general framework for
interactive decision making with multiple agents, encompassing Markov games
with function approximation and normal-form games with bandit feedback. We
focus on equilibrium computation, in which a centralized learning algorithm
aims to compute an equilibrium by controlling multiple agents that interact
with an unknown environment. Our main contributions are:
  - We provide upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for
multi-agent decision making based on a multi-agent generalization of the
Decision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster et
al. (2021) in the single-agent counterpart to our setting. Compared to the best
results for the single-agent setting, our bounds have additional gaps. We show
that no ""reasonable"" complexity measure can close these gaps, highlighting a
striking separation between single and multiple agents.
  - We show that characterizing the statistical complexity for multi-agent
decision making is equivalent to characterizing the statistical complexity of
single-agent decision making, but with hidden (unobserved) rewards, a framework
that subsumes variants of the partial monitoring problem. As a consequence, we
characterize the statistical complexity for hidden-reward interactive decision
making to the best extent possible.
  Building on this development, we provide several new structural results,
including 1) conditions under which the statistical complexity of multi-agent
decision making can be reduced to that of single-agent, and 2) conditions under
which the so-called curse of multiple agents can be avoided.

focus solely on protecting the confidentiality of the client data uploaded to a

take advantage of the fact) that the model is held in plaintext. Furthermore,
their aim is to either minimize the latency of the service by processing one

while processing a fixed (large) number of samples. In this work, we present
slytHErin, an agile framework that enables privacy-preserving PaaS beyond the
application scenarios considered in prior works. Thanks to its hybrid design
leveraging HE and its multiparty variant (MHE), slytHErin enables novel PaaS
scenarios by encrypting the data, the model or both. Moreover, slytHErin
features a flexible input data packing approach that allows processing a batch
of an arbitrary number of samples, and several computation optimizations that
are model-and-setting-agnostic. slytHErin is implemented in Go and it allows

Recently, PDMPs have garnered attention within the Monte Carlo community as a

The Zig-Zag sampler and the Bouncy particle sampler are commonly used examples
of the PDMP methodology which have also yielded impressive theoretical
properties, but little is known about their robustness to extreme dependence or
isotropy of the target density. It turns out that PDMPs may suffer from poor
mixing due to anisotropy and this paper investigates this effect in detail in
the stylised but important Gaussian case. To this end, we employ a multi-scale
analysis framework in this paper. Our results show that when the Gaussian
target distribution has two scales, of order $1$ and $\epsilon$, the
computational cost of the Bouncy particle sampler is of order $\epsilon^{-1}$,
and the computational cost of the Zig-Zag sampler is either $\epsilon^{-1}$ or
$\epsilon^{-2}$, depending on the target distribution. In comparison, the cost
of the traditional MCMC methods such as RWM or MALA is of order
$\epsilon^{-2}$, at least when the dimensionality of the small component is
more than $1$. Therefore, there is a robustness advantage to using PDMPs in
this context.

conventional methods which rely on a certain number of selected patches for
feature space refinement, we softly cluster all the instances by allocating
them to their corresponding prototypes. Additionally, our method is able to

between corresponding trained prototypes. More importantly, TPMIL also enables
to provide a more accurate interpretability based on the distance of the

important requirement of inductive power transfer (IPT) systems for electric

feature, to ensure a lower power rating requirement for the switching
converter. CC and CV output along with ZPA can be achieved by using a suitable
compensation topology. Equation manipulation techniques can be used for
designing the compensation topology. But, it can be mathematically intensive
especially for higher order topologies. To overcome this problem, resonant-tank
based approaches are adopted in several works to achieve CC and CV conditions.
However, equation-based approaches are depended upon either wholly or partly
for realizing ZPA. This approach can be tedious and lacks physical insight. The
proposed method extends resonant tank approach to achieve ZPA also, besides CC
and CV. The need for a separate method to achieve ZPA is eliminated. Further,
it simplifies the process in arriving at the constraints that ensure ZPA. As a
sample validation, the proposed method is applied to a S-SP compensation
topology. The CC-ZPA and CV-ZPA constraints for the S-SP topology are shown to
be in line with the ones arrived at using an existing equation-based impedance
approach. The simplicity of the proposed method can be observed from the sample

The nucleon densities entering the model are generated from the experimental

of deformed target nuclei. It is shown that the density-dependent M3Y NN forces
with the finite range exchange part can be mimicked successfully by the
zero-range density-independent forces. The latter option significantly reduces
the required computer time. For the nucleon densities and target nuclei
deformations we employ the values from the commonly used data bases. Thus, we

Therefore, a pre-defined tensor decomposition may not fully exploit low rank
information for a certain dataset, resulting in sub-optimal multi-view
clustering performance. To alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we propose
the adaptively topological tensor network (ATTN) by determining the edge ranks
from the structural information of the self-representation tensor, and it can
give a better tensor representation with the data-driven strategy.
Specifically, in multi-view tensor clustering, we analyze the higher-order
correlations among different modes of a self-representation tensor, and prune
the links of the weakly correlated ones from a fully connected tensor network.
Therefore, the newly obtained tensor networks can efficiently explore the
essential clustering information with self-representation with different tensor
structures for various datasets. A greedy adaptive rank-increasing strategy is
further applied to improve the capture capacity of low rank structure. We apply
ATTN on multi-view subspace clustering and utilize the alternating direction

high-dimensional spaces, as supported by an abundance of experimental evidence.
However, we still need a solid theoretical understanding of what they can
approximate and, more importantly, at what cost and accuracy. One network
architecture of practical use, especially for approximation tasks involving
images, is convolutional (residual) networks. However, due to the locality of
the linear operators involved in these networks, their analysis is more
complicated than for generic fully connected neural networks. This paper
focuses on sequence approximation tasks, where a matrix or a higher-order
tensor represents each observation. We show that when approximating sequences
arising from space-time discretisations of PDEs we may use relatively small
networks. We constructively derive these results by exploiting connections
between discrete convolution and finite difference operators. Throughout, we
design our network architecture to, while having guarantees, be similar to
those typically adopted in practice for sequence approximation tasks. Our
theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments which simulate
linear advection, the heat equation, and the Fisher equation. The

self-supervised Vision Transformers (ViTs) have the following properties: (1)
CL trains self-attentions to capture longer-range global patterns than MIM,
such as the shape of an object, especially in the later layers of the ViT
architecture. This CL property helps ViTs linearly separate images in their
representation spaces. However, it also makes the self-attentions collapse into
homogeneity for all query tokens and heads. Such homogeneity of self-attention
reduces the diversity of representations, worsening scalability and dense
prediction performance. (2) CL utilizes the low-frequency signals of the
representations, but MIM utilizes high-frequencies. Since low- and
high-frequency information respectively represent shapes and textures, CL is
more shape-oriented and MIM more texture-oriented. (3) CL plays a crucial role
in the later layers, while MIM mainly focuses on the early layers. Upon these
analyses, we find that CL and MIM can complement each other and observe that
even the simplest harmonization can help leverage the advantages of both

ultrafast phenomena and has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of
the fundamental physics of matter. We theoretically investigate the
spin-orientation-resolved attosecond chronoscopy for the first time by the
circular RABBIT technique for Kr atoms. Due to the spin-orbit interaction and
the sensitivity of ionization in circularly polarized fields to the sense of
electron rotation in the initial state, the spin-resolved ionization rates of
photoelectrons emitted from $^2P_{1/2}$ and $^2P_{3/2}$ channels can be
expressed via $m$-resolved ionization rates of initial state, where $m$ is the
orbital magnetic quantum number. We demonstrate that the yields difference
between spin-up and spin-down photoelectrons from each channel are closely
associated with the different behaviors of corresponding Wigner time delay. We
find that the Wigner time delay between spin-up and spin-down photoelectrons in
the polarization plane can reach several tens of attoseconds in the co-rotating
geometry, but a few attoseconds in the counter-rotating geometry. Our approach
opens up a new avenue for probing the spin-dependent behavior of Wigner time
delay, and lays the foundation for spin-orientation-resolved attosecond
chronoscopy, which can be verified by the current experimental techniques.

challenges to developing clinically robust deep learning models. Federated
learning (FL) addresses the former by enabling different medical clients to
collaboratively train a deep model without sharing data. However, the class
imbalance problem persists due to inter-client class distribution variations.
To overcome this, we propose federated classifier anchoring (FCA) by adding a
personalized classifier at each client to guide and debias the federated model
through consistency learning. Additionally, FCA debiases the federated
classifier and each client's personalized classifier based on their respective
class distributions, thus mitigating divergence. With FCA, the federated
feature extractor effectively learns discriminative features suitably globally
for federation as well as locally for all participants. In clinical practice,
the federated model is expected to be both generalized, performing well across
clients, and specialized, benefiting each individual client from collaboration.
According to this, we propose a novel evaluation metric to assess models'
generalization and specialization performance globally on an aggregated public
test set and locally at each client. Through comprehensive comparison and
evaluation, FCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with large margins for
federated long-tailed skin lesion classification and intracranial hemorrhage
classification, making it a more feasible solution in clinical settings.

ArXiv:2303.16701 (2023); Suchanek, Kroy, Loos, ArXiv:2305.05633 (2023)]. Due to
the nonreciprocal coupling between two field components, the model is
inherently out of equilibrium and can be regarded as an active field theory.
Beyond the conventional homogeneous and static-demixed phases, it exhibits a
traveling-wave phase, which can be entered via either an oscillatory
instability or a critical exceptional point. By means of a Fourier
decomposition of the entropy production rate, we can quantify the
scale-resolved time-reversal symmetry breaking, in all phases and across the
transitions, in the low-noise limit. Our perturbative calculation reveals its
dependence on the strength of the nonreciprocal coupling. Surging entropy
production near the static-dynamic transitions can be attributed to
entropy-generating fluctuations in the longest wavelength mode and heralds the
emerging traveling wave. Its translational dynamics can be mapped on the
dissipative ballistic motion of an active (quasi)particle.

of faint cirrus is accurate removal of a contaminating spatially varying sky
background. We present a technique to analyse two images of the same cirrus
field concurrently, correlating pixel values to capture the relationship and
simultaneously fitting the sky background as a complex non-correlating additive
component. For the Spider, we measure a $g-r$ color of 0.644$\pm 0.024$ and a
visible wavelength to 250 $\mu$m intensity ratio of $10^{-3} \times (0.855

emission to predict an upper limit to the amount of scattered light. The actual
brightness of the cirrus will be fainter than this limit because of anisotropic
scattering by the dust combined with anisotropy of the incident interstellar

untrusted clouds are vulnerable to various forms of privileged attacks. The
emergence of trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX mitigates
this problem. TEEs protect code and data in secure enclaves inaccessible to

TEEs, developers must manually partition their applications into trusted and

applications poses two important challenges: (i) ensuring efficient object
communication between the partitioned components, and (ii) ensuring the
consistency of garbage collection between the parts, especially with
memory-managed languages such as Java. We present Montsalvat, a tool which
provides a practical and intuitive annotation-based partitioning approach for
Java applications destined for secure enclaves. Montsalvat provides an RMI-like
mechanism to ensure inter-object communication, as well as consistent garbage

the consistency with the imaging process and well-studied noise modeling in the
raw domain. However, two problems still hinder the denoising performance.
Firstly, there is no large dataset with realistic motions for supervised raw
video denoising, as capturing noisy and clean frames for real dynamic scenes is
difficult. To address this, we propose recapturing existing high-resolution
videos displayed on a 4K screen with high-low ISO settings to construct
noisy-clean paired frames. In this way, we construct a video denoising dataset
(named as ReCRVD) with 120 groups of noisy-clean videos, whose ISO values
ranging from 1600 to 25600. Secondly, while non-local temporal-spatial
attention is beneficial for denoising, it often leads to heavy computation
costs. We propose an efficient raw video denoising transformer network
(RViDeformer) that explores both short and long-distance correlations.
Specifically, we propose multi-branch spatial and temporal attention modules,
which explore the patch correlations from local window, local low-resolution
window, global downsampled window, and neighbor-involved window, and then they
are fused together. We employ reparameterization to reduce computation costs.
Our network is trained in both supervised and unsupervised manners, achieving
the best performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the
model trained with our proposed dataset (ReCRVD) outperforms the model trained
with previous benchmark dataset (CRVD) when evaluated on the real-world outdoor
noisy videos. Our code and dataset will be released after the acceptance of

missing information between two points. To solve the closure problem in
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS), an eddy-viscosity hypotheses
has been a popular modelling choice, where it follows either a linear or
non-linear stress-strain relationship. Here, a non-constant diffusivity is
introduced. Such a non-constant diffusivity is also characteristic of
non-Fickian diffusion equation addressing anomalous diffusion process. An
alternative approach, is a fractional derivative based diffusion equations.
Thus, in the paper, we formulate a fractional stress-strain relationship using
variable-order Caputo fractional derivative. This provides new opportunities
for future modelling effort. We pedagogically study of our model construction,
starting from one-sided model and followed by two-sided model. Non-locality at
a point is the amalgamation of all the effects, thus we find the two-sided
model is physically consistent. Further, our construction can also addresses
viscous effects, which is a local process. Thus, our fractional model addresses
the amalgamation of local and non-local process. We also show its validity at
infinite Reynolds number limit. This study is further extended to tempered
fractional calculus, where tempering ensures finite jump lengths, this is an
important remark for unbounded flows. Two tempered definitions are introduced
with a smooth and sharp cutoff, by the exponential term and Heaviside function,
respectively and we also define the horizon of non-local interactions. We
further study the equivalence between the two definitions.

for FedSSL rely on a closed-world assumption that all local training data and
global testing data are from seen classes observed in the labeled dataset. It
is crucial to go one step further: adapting FL models to an open-world setting,
where unseen classes exist in the unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a
novel Federatedopen-world Semi-Supervised Learning (FedoSSL) framework, which
can solve the key challenge in distributed and open-world settings, i.e., the
biased training process for heterogeneously distributed unseen classes.
Specifically, since the advent of a certain unseen class depends on a client
basis, the locally unseen classes (exist in multiple clients) are likely to
receive differentiated superior aggregation effects than the globally unseen
classes (exist only in one client). We adopt an uncertainty-aware suppressed
loss to alleviate the biased training between locally unseen and globally
unseen classes. Besides, we enable a calibration module supplementary to the
global aggregation to avoid potential conflicting knowledge transfer caused by
inconsistent data distribution among different clients. The proposed FedoSSL
can be easily adapted to state-of-the-art FL methods, which is also validated
via extensive experiments on benchmarks and real-world datasets (CIFAR-10,

yet dynamic user interests and letting users receive recommendation only
passively. Recent conversational recommender systems (CRSs) tackle those
limitations by enabling recommender systems to interact with the user to obtain
her/his current preference through a sequence of clarifying questions. Despite
the progress achieved in CRSs, existing solutions are far from satisfaction in
the following two aspects: 1) current CRSs usually require each user to answer
a quantity of clarifying questions before reaching the final recommendation,
which harms the user experience; 2) there is a semantic gap between the learned
representations of explicitly mentioned attributes and items. To address these
drawbacks, we introduce the knowledge graph (KG) as the auxiliary information
for comprehending and reasoning a user's preference, and propose a new CRS
framework, namely Knowledge Enhanced Conversational Reasoning (KECR) system. As
a user can reflect her/his preference via both attribute- and item-level
expressions, KECR closes the semantic gap between two levels by embedding the
structured knowledge in the KG. Meanwhile, KECR utilizes the connectivity
within the KG to conduct explicit reasoning of the user demand, making the
model less dependent on the user's feedback to clarifying questions. KECR can
find a prominent reasoning chain to make the recommendation explainable and
more rationale, as well as smoothen the conversation process, leading to better
user experience and conversational recommendation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate our approach's superiority
over state-of-the-art baselines in both automatic evaluations and human

problem in the field of digital human and metaverse. A modern talking face
generation method is expected to achieve the goals of generalized audio-lip
synchronization, good video quality, and high system efficiency. Recently,
neural radiance field (NeRF) has become a popular rendering technique in this
field since it could achieve high-fidelity and 3D-consistent talking face
generation with a few-minute-long training video. However, there still exist
several challenges for NeRF-based methods: 1) as for the lip synchronization,
it is hard to generate a long facial motion sequence of high temporal
consistency and audio-lip accuracy; 2) as for the video quality, due to the
limited data used to train the renderer, it is vulnerable to out-of-domain
input condition and produce bad rendering results occasionally; 3) as for the
system efficiency, the slow training and inference speed of the vanilla NeRF
severely obstruct its usage in real-world applications. In this paper, we
propose GeneFace++ to handle these challenges by 1) utilizing the pitch contour
as an auxiliary feature and introducing a temporal loss in the facial motion
prediction process; 2) proposing a landmark locally linear embedding method to
regulate the outliers in the predicted motion sequence to avoid robustness
issues; 3) designing a computationally efficient NeRF-based motion-to-video
renderer to achieves fast training and real-time inference. With these
settings, GeneFace++ becomes the first NeRF-based method that achieves stable
and real-time talking face generation with generalized audio-lip
synchronization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in terms of subjective and objective evaluation.

communication (PVLC) for simultaneous energy harvesting and visible light

alignment, and self-powered operation. However, PV modules usually have a
severe bandwidth limitation when used as passive photodetectors. In this paper,
we systematically investigate the internal impedance dynamic of PV modules and
how that affects their frequency response characteristics under different
illuminances. We propose a simplified yet accurate dynamic PV mode AC detection
model to capture the frequency response characteristics of a PVLC receiver. The
model is validated with the impedance spectroscopy characterization
methodologies. Experimental results show that a PV module's internal resistance
and capacitance depend on incident illuminance, affecting PV's frequency
response. The bandwidth is exacerbated under indoor environments with low
illuminance levels due to the increment of internal resistance for PV modules.
The RC constant can be reduced for PVLC receivers working near open-circuit
voltage conditions by adding a moderate local light to decrease the internal
resistance value. For practical implementation, PVLC receivers will employ a
load for data recovery. We show that adjusting the forward bias conditions can
simultaneously reduce the resistance and capacitance values. With the
optimization of equivalent trans-impedance, the data rate of a Cadmium
telluride (CdTe) PV module achieves a 3.8 times enhancement under 200 lux. We
also demonstrate that the BER of a 5-Mbit/s eight-level pulse amplitude

three seemingly contradictory signatures: close-in super-Earths are more
prevalent around M dwarfs than FGK dwarfs; inner super-Earths are correlated
with outer giants; and outer giants are less common around M dwarfs than FGK
dwarfs. Here, we build a simple framework that combines the theory of pebble
accretion with the measurements of dust masses in protoplanetary disks to
reconcile all three observations. First, we show that cooler stars are more
efficient at converting pebbles into planetary cores at short orbital periods.
Second, when disks are massive enough to nucleate a heavy core at 5 AU, more
than enough dust can drift in to assemble inner planets, establishing the
correlation between inner planets and outer giants. Finally, while stars of
varying masses are similarly capable of converting pebbles into cores at long
orbital periods, hotter stars are much more likely to harbor more massive dust
disks so that the giant planet occurrence rate rises around hotter stars. Our
results are valid over a wide range of parameter space for a disk accretion
rate that follows $\dot{M}_\star \sim 10^{-8}\,M_\odot\,{\rm

planet can trigger Auroral Radio Emission (ARE), due to the Electron Cyclotron
Maser mechanism. The high brightness temperature of this emission makes it
visible at large distances, opening new opportunities to study exoplanets and
to search for favourable conditions for the development of extra-terrestrial
life, as magnetic fields act as a shield that protects life against external
particles and influences the evolution of the planetary atmospheres. In the
last few years, we started an observational campaign to observe a sample of
nearby M-type stars known to host exoplanets with the aim to detect ARE. We
observed YZ Ceti with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in
band 4 (550-900 MHz) nine times over a period of five months. We detected radio
emission four times, two of which with high degree of circular polarization.
With statistical considerations we exclude the possibility of flares due to
stellar magnetic activity. Instead, when folding the detections to the orbital
phase of the closest planet YZ Cet b, they are at positions where we would
expect ARE due to star-planet interaction (SPI) in sub-Alfvenic regime. With a
degree of confidence higher than 4.37 sigma, YZ Cet is the first extrasolar
systems with confirmed SPI at radio wavelengths. Modelling the ARE, we estimate
a magnetic field for the star of about 2.4 kG and we find that the planet must
have a magnetosphere. The lower limit for the polar magnetic field of the
planet is 0.4 G.

exclusive sets of agents, i.e., travelers/users and operators, forming a
mobility ecosystem in which multiple operators compete or cooperate to serve
customers under a governing platform provider. This study proposes a MaaS
platform equilibrium model based on many-to-many assignment games incorporating
both fixed-route transit services and mobility-on-demand (MOD) services. The
matching problem is formulated as a multicommodity flow network design problem
under congestion. The local stability conditions reflect a generalization of
Wardrop's principles that include operator decisions. A subsidy mechanism from
the platform is proposed to guarantee local stability. An exact solution
algorithm is proposed based on a branch and bound framework with a Frank-Wolfe
algorithm integrated with Lagrangian relaxation and subgradient optimization,
which guarantees the optimality of the matching problem but not stability. A
heuristic which integrates stability conditions and subsidy design is proposed,
which reaches either the optimal MaaS platform equilibrium solution with global
stability, or a feasible locally stable solution that may require subsidy. A
worst-case bound and condition for obtaining an exact solution are both
identified. Two sets of reproducible numerical experiments are conducted. The
first, on a toy network, verifies the model and algorithm, and illustrates the
differences between local and global stability. The second, on an expanded

about the model for coopetitive interdependencies between operators sharing the

allows us to access the dynamical history of exoplanetary systems. Here, we
have examined the distribution of spin-orbit angles for close-in exoplanets and
put it in a statistical context of tidal interactions between planets and their
stars. We confirm the observed trends between the obliquity and physical
quantities directly connected to tides, namely the stellar effective
temperature, the planet-to-star mass ratio, and the scaled orbital distance. We
further devised a tidal efficiency factor combining critical parameters that
control the strength of tidal effects and used it to corroborate the strong
link between the spin-orbit angle distribution and tidal interactions. In
particular, we developed a readily usable formula to estimate the probability
that a system is misaligned, which will prove useful in global population
studies. By building a robust statistical framework, we reconstructed the
distribution of the three-dimensional spin-orbit angles, allowing for a sample
of nearly 200 true obliquities to be analyzed for the first time. This
realistic distribution maintains the sky-projected trends, and additionally
hints toward a striking pileup of truly aligned systems. The comparison between
the full population and a pristine subsample unaffected by tidal interactions
suggests that perpendicular architectures are resilient toward tidal
realignment, providing evidence that orbital misalignments are sculpted by
disruptive dynamical processes that preferentially lead to polar orbits. On the
other hand, star-planet interactions seem to efficiently realign or quench the
formation of any tilted configuration other than for polar orbits, and in
particular for antialigned orbits.

cumulative second moment of the learner's losses $V_T$, and a closely related
first-order bound of order $\tilde O(K\sqrt{d L_T^*})$ in terms of the
cumulative loss of the best policy $L_T^*$. Since $V_T$ or $L_T^*$ may be
significantly smaller than $T$, these improve over the worst-case regret

with a host Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) through a Feshbach resonance. On the
repulsive side at strong couplings, theoretical approaches predict two distinct
polaron branches corresponding to attractive and repulsive polarons, but it
remains unclear how the two are related. This is partly due to the challenges
resulting from a competition of strongly attractive (destabilizing)
impurity-boson interactions with weakly repulsive (stabilizing) boson-boson
interactions, whose interplay is difficult to describe with contemporary
theoretical methods. Here we develop a powerful variational framework that
combines Gaussian correlations among impurity-boson scattering states,
including up to an infinite number of bosonic excitations, with exact
non-Gaussian correlations among bosons occupying an impurity-boson bound state.
This variational scheme enables a full treatment of strong nonlinearities
arising in the Feshbach molecule on the repulsive side of the resonance. Within
this framework, we demonstrate that the interplay of impurity-induced
instability and stabilization by repulsive boson-boson interactions results in
a discrete set of metastable many-body bound states at intermediate energies
between the attractive and repulsive polaron branches. These states exhibit
strong quantum statistical characteristics in the form of non-Gaussian quantum
correlations, requiring non-perturbative beyond mean-field treatments for their
characterization. Furthermore, these many-body bound states have sizable
molecular spectral weights, accessible via molecular spectroscopy techniques.
This work provides a unified theory of attractive and repulsive Bose polarons

little attentions in traditional methods. First, two separate branches are set
for edge and body segmentation with CNNs and Transformer based architecture

Furthermore, PGMF module is embedded for feature integration with prior guided

direction, with Resource Selection Games and Congestion Games as prominent
examples. In these games, agents select available resources and their utility
then depends on the number of agents using the same resources. This implies
that there is no distinction between the agents, i.e., they are anonymous.
  We depart from this very general setting by proposing Resource Selection
Games with heterogeneous agents that strive for joint resource usage with
similar agents. So, instead of the number of other users of a given resource,
our model considers agents with different types and the decisive feature is the
fraction of same-type agents among the users. More precisely, similarly to
Schelling Games, there is a tolerance threshold $\tau \in [0,1]$ which
specifies the agents' desired minimum fraction of same-type agents on a
resource. Agents strive to select resources where at least a $\tau$-fraction of
those resources' users have the same type as themselves. For $\tau=1$, our
model generalizes Hedonic Diversity Games with a peak at $1$.
  For our general model, we consider the existence and quality of equilibria
and the complexity of maximizing social welfare. Additionally, we consider a
bounded rationality model, where agents can only estimate the utility of a
resource, since they only know the fraction of same-type agents on a given
resource, but not the exact numbers. Thus, they cannot know the impact a
strategy change would have on a target resource. Interestingly, we show that
this type of bounded rationality yields favorable game-theoretic properties and
specific equilibria closely approximate equilibria of the full knowledge
setting.

  Methods: We introduce a novel workflow using the OpenAI GPT API for screening
titles and abstracts in clinical reviews. A Python script was created to make
calls to the GPT API with the screening criteria in natural language and a
corpus of title and abstract datasets that have been filtered by a minimum of
two human reviewers. We compared the performance of our model against
human-reviewed papers across six review papers, screening over 24,000 titles

  Results: Our results show an accuracy of 0.91, a sensitivity of excluded
papers of 0.91, and a sensitivity of included papers of 0.76. On a randomly
selected subset of papers, the GPT API demonstrated the ability to provide
reasoning for its decisions and corrected its initial decision upon being asked
to explain its reasoning for a subset of incorrect classifications.
  Conclusion: The GPT API has the potential to streamline the clinical review
process, save valuable time and effort for researchers, and contribute to the
overall quality of clinical reviews. By prioritizing the workflow and acting as
an aid rather than a replacement for researchers and reviewers, the GPT API can
enhance efficiency and lead to more accurate and reliable conclusions in

efficacy of new therapies, there are limitations regarding what comparisons can

comparator arms and often compare a new therapeutic to a standard of care which
has already proven efficacious. It is sometimes of interest to estimate the
efficacy of the new therapy relative to a treatment that was not evaluated in
the same trial, such as a placebo or an alternative therapy that was evaluated
in a different trial. Such multi-study comparisons are challenging because of
potential differences between trial populations that can affect the outcome. In
this paper, two bridging estimators are considered that allow for comparisons
of treatments evaluated in different trials using data fusion methods to
account for measured differences in trial populations. A ""multi-span''
estimator leverages a shared arm between two trials, while a ""single-span''
estimator does not require a shared arm. A diagnostic statistic that compares
the outcome in the standardized shared arms is provided. The two estimators are
compared in simulations, where both estimators demonstrate minimal empirical
bias and nominal confidence interval coverage when the identification
assumptions are met. The estimators are applied to data from the AIDS Clinical
Trials Group 320 and 388 to compare the efficacy of two-drug versus four-drug
antiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell counts among persons with advanced HIV. The
single-span approach requires fewer identification assumptions and was more
efficient in simulations and the application.

unclear if the studied perturbations always preserve a core assumption of
adversarial examples: that of unchanged semantic content. To address this
problem, we introduce a more principled notion of an adversarial graph, which
is aware of semantic content change. Using Contextual Stochastic Block Models
(CSBMs) and real-world graphs, our results uncover: $i)$ for a majority of
nodes the prevalent perturbation models include a large fraction of perturbed
graphs violating the unchanged semantics assumption; $ii)$ surprisingly, all
assessed GNNs show over-robustness - that is robustness beyond the point of
semantic change. We find this to be a complementary phenomenon to adversarial
examples and show that including the label-structure of the training graph into
the inference process of GNNs significantly reduces over-robustness, while
having a positive effect on test accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Theoretically, leveraging our new semantics-aware notion of robustness, we
prove that there is no robustness-accuracy tradeoff for inductively classifying
a newly added node.

also increasingly important in designing sustainable larger-scale systems for
edge applications. For sustained operations, such systems must consider not

environment in their design and operation. Unfortunately, prior work generally
ignores the impact of thermal effects, and instead implicitly assumes ideal

learning to rank (CLTR). Such data suffers from presentation bias. Much work in
unbiased learning to rank (ULTR) focuses on position bias, i.e., items at
higher ranks are more likely to be examined and clicked. Inter-item
dependencies also influence examination probabilities, with outlier items in a
ranking as an important example. Outliers are defined as items that observably
deviate from the rest and therefore stand out in the ranking. In this paper, we
identify and introduce the bias brought about by outlier items: users tend to
click more on outlier items and their close neighbors. To this end, we first
conduct a controlled experiment to study the effect of outliers on user clicks.
Next, to examine whether the findings from our controlled experiment generalize
to naturalistic situations, we explore real-world click logs from an e-commerce
platform. We show that, in both scenarios, users tend to click significantly
more on outlier items than on non-outlier items in the same rankings. We show
that this tendency holds for all positions, i.e., for any specific position, an
item receives more interactions when presented as an outlier as opposed to a
non-outlier item. We conclude from our analysis that the effect of outliers on
clicks is a type of bias that should be addressed in ULTR. We therefore propose
an outlier-aware click model that accounts for both outlier and position bias,
called outlier-aware position-based model ( OPBM). We estimate click
propensities based on OPBM ; through extensive experiments performed on both
real-world e-commerce data and semi-synthetic data, we verify the effectiveness
of our outlier-aware click model. Our results show the superiority of OPBM
against baselines in terms of ranking performance and true relevance
estimation.

gradual decline of the outer rotation curve ($dV/dR =
-1.7\;\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-1}$), and extrapolates well
out to 50 kpc. Rotationally supported Local Group galaxies are in excellent
agreement with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation. Pressure supported dwarfs
that are the most likely to be in dynamical equilibrium also align with this

dynamical masses of the Milky Way and M31 ($M_{200} \approx 1.4$ and $1.6

onset of planet formation, large amounts of these elements are stored in ices

by dynamical transport, collisional processes, and the formation and
sublimation of ice. We aim to constrain the disk regions where these processes
are fully coupled, and develop a flexible modelling approach that is able to
predict the effects of these processes acting simultaneously on the CHNOS
budgets of the dust in these regions. We compared timescales associated with
these disk processes to constrain the disk regions where this approach is
necessary, and developed the SHAMPOO code, which tracks the CHNOS abundances in
the ice mantle of a single monomer dust particle, embedded in a larger
aggregate and undergoing these processes simultaneously. The adsorption and
photodesorption of monomer ices depend on the depth of the monomer in the
aggregate. We investigated the effect of fragmentation velocity and aggregate
filling factor on the amount of ice on monomers residing at r = 10 AU. The
locations where disk processes are fully coupled depend on both grain size and
ice species. Monomers embedded in aggregates with fragmentation velocities of 1
m/s are able to undergo adsorption and photodesorption more often compared to a
fragmentation velocity of 5 m/s or 10 m/s. Aggregates with a filling factor of
$10^{-3}$ are able to accumulate ice 22 times faster on average than aggregates
with a filling factor of 1. As different grain sizes are coupled through
collisions and the grain ice consists of multiple ice species, it is difficult
to isolate the locations where disk processes are fully coupled, necessitating
the development of the SHAMPOO code. The processing of ice may not be spatially
limited to dust aggregate surfaces for either fragile or porous aggregates.

Bayesian system identification strategies, the correlation in the model
prediction error can become significant. The widely adopted assumption of
uncorrelated Gaussian error may lead to inaccurate parameter estimation and
overconfident predictions, which may lead to sub-optimal decisions. This paper
addresses the challenges of performing Bayesian system identification for
structures when large datasets are used, considering both spatial and temporal
dependencies in the model uncertainty. We present an approach to efficiently
evaluate the log-likelihood function, and we utilize nested sampling to compute
the evidence for Bayesian model selection. The approach is first demonstrated
on a synthetic case and then applied to a (measured) real-world steel bridge.
The results show that the assumption of dependence in the model prediction
uncertainties is decisively supported by the data. The proposed developments
enable the use of large datasets and accounting for the dependency when
performing Bayesian system identification, even when a relatively large number

For high-dimensional distributions, binary classification-based density ratio

challenging. In this work, we show that the state-of-the-art density ratio

due to distribution shifts between training and evaluation time. We present an
alternative method that leverages multi-class classification for density ratio
estimation and does not suffer from distribution shift issues. The method uses
a set of auxiliary densities $\{m_k\}_{k=1}^K$ and trains a multi-class
logistic regression to classify the samples from $p, q$, and $\{m_k\}_{k=1}^K$
into $K+2$ classes. We show that if these auxiliary densities are constructed

generates oversampling when simulating the data. Applying Reverse-Time
Migration to seismic data will generate results with some migration artifacts
depending on the applied imaging conditions. To overcome this dilemma, the
Least-Squares Reverse-Time Migration is applied to the migrated section through
Born modeling and Conjugate Gradient algorithm. Vertical transverse isotropy
(VTI) media yielded as the velocity decreases with depth which distorts the
Reverse-Time Migration results significantly. This problem can be overcome by
applying the Least-Squares Reverse-Time Migration in either the Cartesian or
pseudo-depth domains by applying a proper wavefield extrapolator. Extrapolation
of Least-Squares Reverse-Time Migration reconstructed wavefield using the 2D
constant-density acoustic wave equation transformed into Riemannian domain
treats the oversampling effect of seismic signals by making even sampling and
allows more amplitude to be recovered in the final migrated image...At a
reduced cost, the Finite Difference Riemannian wavefield extrapolator acts on
the Born modelled seismic data, producing accurately similar results to the
classical LSRTM, yet some amplitude differences are appeared due to various
implementation issues and oversampling effect in the latter. The results
support that the domain transformation strategy effectively reduces the
computational time without affecting the accuracy of the conventional LSRTM
results.

programmer. This opacity limits their application towards code intelligence
tasks, particularly for applications like vulnerability detection where a
model's reliance on spurious correlations can be safety-critical. We introduce
a neuron-level approach to interpretability of neural code intelligence models
which eliminates redundancy due to highly similar or task-irrelevant neurons
within these networks. We evaluate the remaining important neurons using
probing classifiers which are often used to ascertain whether certain
properties have been encoded within the latent representations of neural
intelligence models. However, probing accuracies may be artificially inflated
due to repetitive and deterministic nature of tokens in code datasets.
Therefore, we adapt the selectivity metric originally introduced in NLP to
account for probe memorization, to formulate our source-code probing tasks.
Through our neuron analysis, we find that more than 95\% of the neurons are
redundant wrt. our code intelligence tasks and can be eliminated without
significant loss in accuracy. We further trace individual and subsets of
important neurons to specific code properties which could be used to influence
model predictions. We demonstrate that it is possible to identify 'number'
neurons, 'string' neurons, and higher level 'text' neurons which are
responsible for specific code properties. This could potentially be used to
modify neurons responsible for predictions based on incorrect signals.
Additionally, the distribution and concentration of the important neurons
within different source code embeddings can be used as measures of task
complexity, to compare source-code embeddings and guide training choices for
transfer learning over similar tasks.

exactly tight (i.e., matching even the constant) for the canonical quadratic
Gaussian mean estimation problem. Despite considerable existing efforts in
deriving information-theoretic generalization error bounds, applying them to
this simple setting where sample average is used as the estimate of the mean
value of Gaussian data has not yielded satisfying results. In fact, most
existing bounds are order-wise loose in this setting, which has raised concerns
about the fundamental capability of information-theoretic bounds in reasoning
the generalization behavior for machine learning. The proposed new bound adopts
the individual-sample-based approach proposed by Bu et al., but also has
several key new ingredients. Firstly, instead of applying the change of measure
inequality on the loss function, we apply it to the generalization error
function itself; secondly, the bound is derived in a conditional manner;
lastly, a reference distribution, which bears a certain similarity to the prior
distribution in the Bayesian setting, is introduced. The combination of these
components produces a general KL-divergence-based generalization error bound.
We further show that although the conditional bounding and the reference
distribution can make the bound exactly tight, removing them does not
significantly degrade the bound, which leads to a mutual-information-based
bound that is also asymptotically tight in this setting.

performance that aims to capture the user experience by including overhead
costs associated with the quantum computation. A demonstration of quantum
utility by a quantum processing unit (QPU) shows that the QPU can outperform
classical solvers at some tasks of interest to practitioners, when considering
computational overheads. We consider overhead costs that arise in standalone
use of the QPU (as opposed to a hybrid computation context). We define three
early milestones on the path to broad-scale quantum utility that focus on
restricted subsets of overheads: Milestone 0 considers pure anneal time (no
overheads) and has been demonstrated in previous work; Milestone 1 includes
overhead times to access the QPU (that is, programming and readout); and
Milestone 2 incorporates an indirect cost associated with minor embedding.
  We evaluate the performance of a D-Wave Advantage QPU with respect to
Milestones 1 and 2, using a testbed of 13 input classes and seven classical
solvers implemented on CPUs and GPUs. For Milestone 1, the QPU outperformed all
classical solvers in 99% of our tests. For Milestone 2, the QPU outperformed
all classical solvers in 19% of our tests, and the scenarios in which the QPU
found success correspond to cases where classical solvers most frequently
failed.
  Analysis of test results on specific inputs reveals fundamentally distinct
underlying mechanisms that explain the observed differences in quantum and
classical performance profiles. We present evidence-based arguments that these
distinctions bode well for future annealing quantum processors to support
demonstrations of quantum utility on ever-expanding classes of inputs and for

transitions ultimately reflected into reduced control or readout fidelities.
Qubit cloaking was introduced in Lled\'o, Dassonneville, et al.
[arXiv:2022.05758] to temporarily decouple the qubit from the coherent photon
population of a driven cavity, allowing for the application of arbitrary
displacements to the cavity field while avoiding the deleterious effects on the
qubit. For qubit readout, cloaking permits to prearm the cavity with an, in
principle, arbitrarily large number of photons, in anticipation to the
qubit-state-dependent evolution of the cavity field, allowing for improved
readout strategies. Here we take a closer look at two of them. First,
arm-and-release readout, introduced together with qubit cloaking, where after
arming the cavity the cloaking mechanism is released and the cavity field
evolves under the application of a constant drive amplitude. Second, an
arm-and-longitudinal readout scheme, where the cavity drive amplitude is slowly
modulated after the release. We show that the two schemes complement each
other, offering an improvement over the standard dispersive readout for any
values of the dispersive interaction and cavity decay rate, as well as any
target measurement integration time. Our results provide a recommendation for
improving qubit readout without changes to the standard circuit QED
architecture.

This approach allows us to learn a disentangled multimodal prior distribution,

various attributes obtained from two image datasets; the Large-scale CelebFaces

extend the DNN by $k$ empty classes and fine-tune it on the OoD data samples.
To this end, we introduce two loss functions, which 1) entice the DNN to assign

power. Recently, other energy sources such as water, gas, and heating have also
been actively collected. As a result, it is necessary to develop a unified
methodology for anomaly detection across multiple energy sources; however,
research efforts have rarely been made to tackle this issue. The inherent
difficulty with this issue stems from the fact that anomalies are not usually

across different parties. This variability makes rule-based sensitive variable
identification systems that work on one database fail on another. To address
this issue, our paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to
identify sensitive variables in structured data, thus facilitating the
de-identification process. We made a key observation that the distributions of
metadata of PHI fields and non-PHI fields are very different. Based on this
novel finding, we engineered over 30 features from the metadata of the original
features and used machine learning to build classification models to
automatically identify PHI fields in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR)
data. We trained the model on a variety of large EHR databases from different
data sources and found that our algorithm achieves 99% accuracy when detecting
PHI-related fields for unseen datasets. The implications of our study are
significant and can benefit industries that handle sensitive data.

industry. However, the accuracy is still insufficient for real-world
applications since the deep learning network is not designed for car damage
images as inputs, and its segmented masks are still very coarse. This paper
presents MARS (Mask Attention Refinement with Sequential quadtree nodes) for
car damage instance segmentation. Our MARS represents self-attention mechanisms
to draw global dependencies between the sequential quadtree nodes layer and
quadtree transformer to recalibrate channel weights and predict highly accurate
instance masks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that MARS outperforms
state-of-the-art (SOTA) instance segmentation methods on three popular
benchmarks such as Mask R-CNN [9], PointRend [14], and Mask Transfiner [13], by
a large margin of +1.3 maskAP-based R50-FPN backbone and +2.3 maskAP-based
R101-FPN backbone on Thai car-damage dataset. Our demos are available at

influence, and impact. Past research has shown that, in many cases, scholars
present a unique writing style that is manifested in their manuscripts. In this
work, we report a comprehensive investigation into how scholars' writing styles
evolve throughout their careers focusing on their academic relations with their
advisors and peers. Our results show that scholars' writing styles tend to
stabilize early on in their careers -- roughly their 13th publication. Around
the same time, scholars' departures from their advisors' writing styles seem to
converge as well. Last, collaborations involving fewer scholars, scholars from
the same gender, or from the same field of study seem to bring about greater
change in their co-authors' writing styles with younger scholars being
especially influenceable.

of producing highly realistic imagery and visual effects generated by
computers. More recently the performance improvements in Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have enabled developers to exploit sufficient computing power to
build a fair amount of ray tracing applications with the ability to run in
real-time. Typically, real-time ray tracing is achieved by utilizing high
performance kernels written in CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan which can be invoked by
high-level languages via native bindings; a technique that fragments
application code bases as well as limits portability.
  This paper presents a hardware-accelerated ray tracing rendering engine,
fully written in Java, that can seamlessly harness the performance of
underlying GPUs via the TornadoVM framework. Through this paper, we show the
potential of Java and acceleration frameworks to process in real time a compute
intensive application. Our results indicate that it is possible to enable real
time ray tracing from Java by achieving up to 234, 152, 45 frames-per-second in
720p, 1080p, and 4K resolutions, respectively.

of a finite group $G$. Given an $A$-torsor (respectively a gerbe banded by
$A$), we would like to know under what conditions it is induced from an
$A^G$-torsor (respectively a gerbe banded by $A^G$). It is necessary for the
torsor or the gerbe to admit a lift of the group action. Given such a
$G$-action, we define an obstruction class which is a cohomology class in
$H^2(G,A(X))$ for torsors and in $H^3(G,A(X))$ for gerbes. We prove that if a
torsor or a gerbe is induced from the invariants, then the obstruction class is
zero. Moreover, the vanishing of the obstruction class is sufficient for the
reverse conclusion assuming the group cohomology classes locally vanish. The
first two sheaf cohomology groups $H^i(X,A)$ can be realized concretely as the
group of $A$-torsors and the group of abelian gerbes banded by $A$. Using this
realization and the notion of obstruction classes, we describe morphisms of
cohomologies in low degrees which come from a certain spectral sequence. A
particular example of interest is the Hoschild-Serre spectral sequence that
arises in the case of a finite etale Galois cover of a scheme $X$ with Galois
group $G$.

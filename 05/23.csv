language models (LLMs) which exhibit an impressive aptitude for understanding
and producing text akin to human language. Despite the ability to train highly
capable LLMs, the methodology for maintaining their relevancy and rectifying
errors remains elusive. To that end, the past few years have witnessed a surge
in techniques for editing LLMs, the objective of which is to alter the behavior
of LLMs within a specific domain without negatively impacting performance
across other inputs. This paper embarks on a deep exploration of the problems,
methods, and opportunities relating to model editing for LLMs. In particular,
we provide an exhaustive overview of the task definition and challenges
associated with model editing, along with an in-depth empirical analysis of the
most progressive methods currently at our disposal. We also build a new
benchmark dataset to facilitate a more robust evaluation and pinpoint enduring
issues intrinsic to existing techniques. Our objective is to provide valuable
insights into the effectiveness and feasibility of each model editing
technique, thereby assisting the research community in making informed
decisions when choosing the most appropriate method for a specific task or

  Instance Segmentation","CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and precisely segment objects
of unseen categories without any training samples. Since the model is trained
on seen categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all
the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between
background and novel objects that have never shown up in training. These two
challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance
segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and
dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D$^2$Zero with
Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the
performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing
utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in
visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct
dynamical classification based on the input image. Background disambiguation
produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel
objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we significantly
outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., 16.86%
improvement on COCO. Project page: https://henghuiding.github.io/D2Zero/

simplest case of a height-contained fracture. In this study, we propose three
approaches to incorporate the effect of stress layers into the tip asymptote:
non-singular integral formulation, toughness-corrected asymptote, and an
ordinary differential equation approximation of the non-singular integral
formulation mentioned above. As illustrated in the paper, these approaches for
stress-corrected asymptotes differ in computational complexity, the complexity
of implementation, and the accuracy of the approximation. In addition, the size
of the validity region of the stress-corrected asymptote is evaluated, and it
is shown to be greatly reduced relative to the case without layers. In order to
address the issue, the stress relaxation factor is introduced. This, in turn,
allows for enhancing the accuracy of the layer-crossing computation on a

a function of various observables and collision energy. At the same time, the

anti-correlation between the dust density and the HI emission, which uncovers a

consistent with converging motions of the gas in the Taurus MC, with the near

Because anomaly detection is usually an unsupervised task, traditional anomaly
detectors learn a decision boundary by employing heuristics based on
intuitions, which are hard to verify in practice. This introduces some
uncertainty, especially close to the decision boundary, that may reduce the
user trust in the detector's predictions. A way to combat this is by allowing
the detector to reject examples with high uncertainty (Learning to Reject).
This requires employing a confidence metric that captures the distance to the
decision boundary and setting a rejection threshold to reject low-confidence
predictions. However, selecting a proper metric and setting the rejection
threshold without labels are challenging tasks. In this paper, we solve these
challenges by setting a constant rejection threshold on the stability metric
computed by ExCeeD. Our insight relies on a theoretical analysis of such a
metric. Moreover, setting a constant threshold results in strong guarantees: we
estimate the test rejection rate, and derive a theoretical upper bound for both

retrieval techniques employing pre-trained language models, among which the
masked auto-encoder (MAE) pre-training architecture has emerged as the most
promising. The conventional MAE framework relies on leveraging the passage
reconstruction of decoder to bolster the text representation ability of
encoder, thereby enhancing the performance of resulting dense retrieval
systems. Within the context of building the representation ability of the
encoder through passage reconstruction of decoder, it is reasonable to
postulate that a ``more demanding'' decoder will necessitate a corresponding
increase in the encoder's ability. To this end, we propose a novel token
importance aware masking strategy based on pointwise mutual information to
intensify the challenge of the decoder. Importantly, our approach can be
implemented in an unsupervised manner, without adding additional expenses to
the pre-training phase. Our experiments verify that the proposed method is both

scattering phase shift for S, P and D channels are determined using phase
function method by incorporating Deng-Fan potential into respective phase

However, bioacoustics is not a single task but a vast range of small-scale
tasks (such as individual ID, call type, emotional indication) with wide
variety in data characteristics, and most bioacoustic tasks do not come with
strongly-labelled training data. The standard paradigm of supervised learning,
focussed on a single large-scale dataset and/or a generic pre-trained
algorithm, is insufficient. In this work we recast bioacoustic sound event
detection within the AI framework of few-shot learning. We adapt this framework
to sound event detection, such that a system can be given the annotated
start/end times of as few as 5 events, and can then detect events in
long-duration audio -- even when the sound category was not known at the time
of algorithm training. We introduce a collection of open datasets designed to
strongly test a system's ability to perform few-shot sound event detections,
and we present the results of a public contest to address the task. We show
that prototypical networks are a strong-performing method, when enhanced with
adaptations for general characteristics of animal sounds. We demonstrate that
widely-varying sound event durations are an important factor in performance, as
well as non-stationarity, i.e. gradual changes in conditions throughout the
duration of a recording. For fine-grained bioacoustic recognition tasks without
massive annotated training data, our results demonstrate that few-shot sound

anti-meson pairs, baryon pairs and anti-baryon pairs separately and constrain
them by confronting MFHRG results of various susceptibilities with the recent

the thermodynamics of hadronic matter at temperatures below the QCD transition
temperature. Very weak mesonic repulsive interaction is needed only to describe
electric charge susceptibilities and can be neglected in the description of

data science. The minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC) problem asks to
cluster the data points into $k$ clusters such that the sum of squared
distances between the data points and their cluster centers (centroids) is
minimized. This problem is NP-hard, but there exist exact solvers that can
solve such problem to optimality for small or medium size instances.
  In this paper, we use a branch-and-bound solver based on semidefinite
programming relaxations called SOS-SDP to compute the optimum solutions of the
MSSC problem for various $k$ and for multiple datasets, with real and
artificial data, for which the data provider has provided ground truth
clustering.
  Next, we use several extrinsic and intrinsic measures to evaluate how the
optimum clustering and ground truth clustering matches, and how well these
clusterings perform with respect to the criteria underlying the intrinsic
measures. Our calculations show that the ground truth clusterings are generally
far from the optimum solution to the MSSC problem. Moreover, the intrinsic
measures evaluated on the ground truth clusterings are generally significantly
worse compared to the optimum clusterings. However, when the ground truth
clustering is in the form of convex sets, e.g., ellipsoids, that are well
separated from each other, the ground truth clustering comes very close to the
optimum clustering.

representation to monocular scene reconstruction, we develop a scale
calibration algorithm for fast geometric initialization from monocular depth

refine details with fast convergence. We also introduce efficient
high-dimensional Continuous Random Fields (CRFs) to further exploit the
semantic-geometry consistency between scene objects. Experiments show that our

paper, we revisit the usage of data augmentation in model compression and give
a comprehensive study on the relation between model sizes and their optimal

observations: (A) Models in different sizes prefer data augmentation with
different magnitudes. Hence, in iterative pruning, data augmentation with
varying magnitudes leads to better performance than data augmentation with a
consistent magnitude. (B) Data augmentation with a high magnitude may
significantly improve the performance of large models but harm the performance
of small models. Fortunately, small models can still benefit from strong data
augmentations by firstly learning them with ""additional parameters"" and then
discard these ""additional parameters"" during inference. (C) The prediction of a

training, especially the deeper ones. Prediction has been successfully used in
many areas of computer architecture to speed up sequential processing.
Therefore, we propose ADA-GP, that uses gradient prediction adaptively to speed
up deep neural network (DNN) training while maintaining accuracy. ADA-GP works
by incorporating a small neural network to predict gradients for different

feasible to predict a large number of gradients. ADA-GP alternates between DNN
training using backpropagated gradients and DNN training using predicted

realize the speed up potential from gradient prediction. Our extensive
experiments with fourteen DNN models show that ADA-GP can achieve an average
speed up of 1.47x with similar or even higher accuracy than the baseline

widely used to explain the formation of solar filaments. Here, we demonstrate,
for the first time, how multi-dimensional evaporation--condensation in an
arcade setup invariably causes a stretching of the magnetic topology. We aim to
check whether this magnetic stretching during cyclic evaporation--condensation
could reproduce a winking filament. We used our open-source code MPI-AMRVAC to
carry out 2D magnetohydrodynamic simulations based on a quadrupolar
configuration. A periodic localized heating, which modulates the
evaporation--condensation process, was imposed before, during, and after the
formation of the filament. Synthetic H$\alpha$ and 304 \r{A}, images were
produced to compare the results with observations. For the first time, we
noticed the winking filament phenomenon in a simulation of the formation of
on-disk solar filaments, which was in good agreement with observations.
Typically, the period of the winking is different from the period of the
impulsive heating. A forced oscillator model explains this difference and fits
the results well. A parameter survey is also done to look into details of the
magnetic stretching phenomenon. We found that the stronger the heating or the

  temperatures via Glauber dynamics",,,,,"math.PR cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the performance of Glauber dynamics for the random cluster model
with real parameter $q>1$ and temperature $\beta>0$. Recent work by Helmuth,
Jenssen and Perkins detailed the ordered/disordered transition of the model on
random $\Delta$-regular graphs for all sufficiently large $q$ and obtained an
efficient sampling algorithm for all temperatures $\beta$ using cluster
expansion methods. Despite this major progress, the performance of natural
Markov chains, including Glauber dynamics, is not yet well understood on the
random regular graph, partly because of the non-local nature of the model
(especially at low temperatures) and partly because of severe bottleneck
phenomena that emerge in a window around the ordered/disordered transition.
  Nevertheless, it is widely conjectured that the bottleneck phenomena that
impede mixing from worst-case starting configurations can be avoided by
initialising the chain more judiciously. Our main result establishes this
conjecture for all sufficiently large $q$ (with respect to $\Delta$).
Specifically, we consider the mixing time of Glauber dynamics initialised from
the two extreme configurations, the all-in and all-out, and obtain a pair of
fast mixing bounds which cover all temperatures $\beta$, including in
particular the bottleneck window. Our result is inspired by the recent approach
of Gheissari and Sinclair for the Ising model who obtained a similar-flavoured
mixing-time bound on the random regular graph for sufficiently low
temperatures. To cover all temperatures in the RC model, we refine
appropriately the structural results of Helmuth, Jenssen and Perkins about the
ordered/disordered transition and show spatial mixing properties ''within the
phase'', which are then related to the evolution of the chain.

entanglement spectra (ES) of their wavefunctions on long cylinders of finite
circumference. For chiral topological states that possess global
$\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry, we can now understand, as shown in this work, the
nature of the topological phase from the study of the splittings of
degeneracies in the finite-size ES, at a given momentum, solely from the
perspective of conformal field theory (CFT). This is a finer diagnostic than
Li-Haldane ""state-counting"", extending the approach of PRB 106, 035138 (2022)
by two of the authors. We contrast ES of such chiral topological states with
those of a non-chiral PEPS (Kure\v{c}i\'c, Sterdyniak, and Schuch [PRB 99,
045116 (2019)]) also possessing $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ symmetry. That latter PEPS has
the same discrete symmetry as the chiral PEPS: strong breaking of separate
time-reversal and reflection symmetries, with invariance under the product of
these two operations. However, the full analysis of the topological sectors of
the ES of the latter PEPS in prior work [arXiv:2207.03246] shows lack of
chirality, as would be manifested, e.g., by a vanishing chiral central charge.
In the present work, we identify a distinct indicator and hallmark of chirality
in the ES: the splittings of conjugate irreps. We prove that in the ES of the
chiral states conjugate irreps are exactly degenerate, because the operators
[related to the cubic Casimir invariant of $\mathrm{SU}(3)$] that would split
them are forbidden. By contrast, in the ES of non-chiral states, conjugate
splittings are demonstrably non-vanishing. Such a diagnostic significantly
simplifies identification of non-chirality in low-energy finite-size ES for
$\mathrm{SU}(3)$-symmetric topological states.

fostering the simulation of social behaviors; and (4) interact with
environments for learning grounded representations of language, and effectively
tackling embodied tasks such as reasoning, planning, and decision-making in
response to environmental observations. This paper offers a comprehensive
survey of iNLP, starting by proposing a unified definition and framework of the
concept. We then provide a systematic classification of iNLP, dissecting its

the economics literature. Roughly speaking, a domain is single crossing if
monotonicity characterizes incentive compatibility. That is, single-crossing
domains are the standard mathematical formulation of domains that are
informally known as ``single parameter''. In all major single-crossing domains
studied so far (e.g., welfare maximization in various auctions with
single-minded bidders, makespan minimization on related machines), the
performance of the best polynomial-time incentive-compatible mechanisms matches
the performance of the best polynomial-time non-incentive-compatible
algorithms. Our two main results make progress in understanding the power of
incentive-compatible polynomial-time mechanisms in single-crossing domains:
  We provide the first proof of a gap in the power of polynomial-time
incentive-compatible mechanisms and polynomial-time non-incentive-compatible
algorithms: we present an objective function in a single-crossing multi-unit
auction for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that provides an
approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}$, yet no polynomial-time
incentive-compatible mechanism provides a finite approximation (under standard
computational complexity assumptions).
  The objective function used above is not natural. We show that to some extent
this is unavoidable by providing a sweeping positive result for the most
natural objective function in multi-unit auctions, that of welfare
maximization. We present an incentive-compatible FPTAS mechanism for every
multi-unit auction with single-crossing domains. This improves over the
mechanism of Briest et al. [STOC'05] that only applies to the much simpler case
of single-minded bidders.

vectors whose components are given by special values of deformation family of

theorem, the current paper extends it to the case of CM fields. The main
results include (i) a construction of algebraic Witt vectors from special

bursts. Thus, the observed signal from a giant pulse is a noisy but direct
measurement of the impulse response from the ionized interstellar medium. We
use this fact to detect 13,025 giant pulses directly in the baseband data of
two observations of PSR B1937+21. Using the giant pulse signals, we model the
time-varying impulse response with a sparse approximation method, in which the
time dependence at each delay is decomposed in Fourier components, thus
constructing a wavefield as a function of delay and differential Doppler shift.
We find that the resulting wavefield has the expected parabolic shape, with
several diffuse structures within it, suggesting the presence of multiple
scattering locations along the line of sight. We also detect an echo at a delay
of about 2.4 ms, over 1.5 times the rotation period of the pulsar, which
between the two observations moves along the trajectory expected from geometry.
The structures in the wavefield are insufficiently sparse to produce a complete
model of the system, and hence the model is not predictive across gaps larger
than about the scintillation time. Nevertheless, within its range, it
reproduces about 75% of the power of the impulse response, a fraction limited
mostly by the signal-to-noise ratio of the observations. Furthermore, we show
that by deconvolution, using the model impulse response, we can successfully
recover the intrinsic pulsar emission from the observed signal.

between those per-frame encodings and lets them exchange information along the

embeddings back into multi-spectral images. We experimentally evaluate the

from other languages. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent, and under which

pre-collected dataset without active exploration. This problem is faced with
major challenges, such as a limited amount of data and distribution shift.
Existing studies employ the principle of pessimism in face of uncertainty, and
penalize rewards for less visited state-action pairs. In this paper, we
directly model the uncertainty in the transition kernel using an uncertainty
set, and then employ the approach of distributionally robust optimization that
optimizes the worst-case performance over the uncertainty set. We first design
a Hoeffding-style uncertainty set, which guarantees that the true transition
kernel lies in the uncertainty set with high probability. We theoretically
prove that it achieves an $\epsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left((1-\gamma)^{-4}\epsilon^{-2}SC^{\pi^*} \right)$, where
$\gamma$ is the discount factor, $C^{\pi^*}$ is the single-policy
concentrability for any comparator policy $\pi^*$, and $S$ is the number of
states. We further design a Bernstein-style uncertainty set, which does not
necessarily guarantee the true transition kernel lies in the uncertainty set.
We show an improved and near-optimal sample complexity of
$\mathcal{O}\left((1-\gamma)^{-3}\epsilon^{-2}\left(SC^{\pi^*}+(\mu_{\min})^{-1}\right)
\right)$, where $\mu_{\min}$ denotes the minimal non-zero entry of the behavior
distribution. In addition, the computational complexity of our algorithms is
the same as one of the LCB-based methods in the literature. Our results
demonstrate that distributionally robust optimization method can also
efficiently solve offline reinforcement learning.

basic and lightweight Bayesian deep learning techniques like the Laplace

knowledge, e.g., in the form of conservation laws. We explore how mechanistic
knowledge and uncertainty quantification interact on two recently proposed
neural ODE frameworks - symplectic neural ODEs and physical models augmented
with neural ODEs. In particular, uncertainty reflects the effect of mechanistic
information more directly than the predictive power of the trained model could.
And vice versa, structure can improve the extrapolation abilities of neural
ODEs, a fact that can be best assessed in practice through uncertainty

focus on adaptive distributed filtering, a new direction in filtering DDoS
traffic. In our design, a subscriber to the distributed filtering service can
act on behalf of a DDoS victim and generate filtering rules that not only adapt
to the most suitable and effective filtering granularity (e.g., IP source
address and a port number vs. an individual IP address vs. IP prefixes at
different lengths), but also adapt to the preferences of the subscriber (e.g.,
maximum coverage of DDoS traffic vs. minimum collateral damage from dropping
legitimate traffic vs. minimum number of rules).
  We design an efficient algorithm that can generate rules adaptive toward
filtering granularities and objectives, which can further help determine where
to deploy generated rules for the best efficacy. We evaluated our system
through both large-scale simulations based on real-world DDoS attack traces and
pilot studies. Our evaluations confirm that our algorithm can generate rules

We studied the success rate and distribution of rule deployment under different

biases - for example, demonstrating a strong bias to predict labels according
to sentiment rather than shallow lexical features, like punctuation. Second, we
evaluate the effect of different interventions that are designed to impose an
inductive bias in favor of a particular feature, such as adding a natural
language instruction or using semantically relevant label words. We find that,
while many interventions can influence the learner to prefer a particular
feature, it can be difficult to overcome strong prior biases. Overall, our
results provide a broader picture of the types of features that ICL may be more

what progenitor systems are more likely to produce SNe Ia remain open. No
single published model is able to consistently explain all observational

progenitor paradigm or the improvement of current models is needed if all SNe
Ia arise from the same origin. An alternative scenario is that different

Fields (NeRFs) is their memory efficiency: large scenes can be efficiently
stored and shared as small neural nets instead of collections of images.
However, operating on these implicit visual data structures requires extending
classical image-based vision techniques (e.g., registration, blending) from
image sets to neural fields. Towards this goal, we propose NeRFuser, a novel
architecture for NeRF registration and blending that assumes only access to
pre-generated NeRFs, and not the potentially large sets of images used to
generate them. We propose registration from re-rendering, a technique to infer
the transformation between NeRFs based on images synthesized from individual
NeRFs. For blending, we propose sample-based inverse distance weighting to
blend visual information at the ray-sample level. We evaluate NeRFuser on
public benchmarks and a self-collected object-centric indoor dataset, showing
the robustness of our method, including to views that are challenging to render

Based on that, we show how faithfulness can be simply treated as a candidate

generates candidate images for a text prompt and picks the best one according
to an automatic scoring system that can leverage already existing T2I

systematic reduction of deterministic models of enzyme kinetics. Geometric
singular perturbation theory, of which eigenvalue disparity is central,
provides a coordinate-free framework for deriving reduced mass action models in
the deterministic realm. Moreover, homologous deterministic reductions are
often employed in stochastic models to reduce the computational complexity
required to simulate reactions with the Gillespie algorithm. Interestingly,
several detailed studies indicate that timescale separation does not always
guarantee the accuracy of reduced stochastic models. In this work, we examine
the roles of timescale separation and coordinate transformations in the
reduction of the Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) and, unlike previous studies,
we do not require the system to be comprised of distinct fast and slow
variables. Instead, we adopt a coordinate-free approach. We demonstrate that
eigenvalue disparity does not guarantee the accuracy of the reduced LNA, known
as the slow scale LNA (ssLNA). However, the inaccuracy of the ssLNA can often
be eliminated with a proper coordinate transformation. For planar systems in
separated (standard) form, we prove that the error between the variances of the
slow variable generated by the LNA and the ssLNA is $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$.
We also address a nilpotent Jacobian scenario and use the blow-up method to
construct a reduced equation that is accurate near the singular limit in the
deterministic regime. However, this reduction in the stochastic regime is far
less accurate, which illustrates that eigenvalue disparity plays a central role
in stochastic model reduction.

of the vital causes is inadequate datasets -- 1) current public datasets can
only support researchers to explore high-fidelity head avatars in one or two

limited data volume, and narrow distribution over different attributes. In this

million complete head frames, and over 800k video sequences from 500 different
identities captured by synchronized multi-view cameras at 30 FPS. It is a
large-scale digital library for head avatars with three key attributes: 1) High
Fidelity: all subjects are captured by 60 synchronized, high-resolution 2K
cameras in 360 degrees. 2) High Diversity: The collected subjects vary from
different ages, eras, ethnicities, and cultures, providing abundant materials
with distinctive styles in appearance and geometry. Moreover, each subject is
asked to perform various motions, such as expressions and head rotations, which
further extend the richness of assets. 3) Rich Annotations: we provide
annotations with different granularities: cameras' parameters, matting, scan,
2D/3D facial landmarks, FLAME fitting, and text description.

pancakes just after shell-crossing, and find a simple analytical formula for
the force along the collapse direction, which can be applied to both the
single- and multi-stream regimes. The formula is tested on the early growth of
CDM protohaloes seeded by two or three crossed sine waves. Adopting the
high-order Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) solution as a proxy for the
dynamics, we confirm that our analytical prediction agrees well with the exact
solution computed by direct resolution of the Poisson equation, as long as the
caustic structure remains locally sufficiently one-dimensional. These results
are further confirmed by comparisons of the LPT predictions performed this way
to measurements in Vlasov simulations performed with the public code ColDICE.
We also show that the component of the force orthogonal to the collapse
direction preserves its single stream nature by not changing qualitatively
before and after the collapse, allowing sufficiently high-order LPT
acceleration to be used to approximate it accurately as long as the LPT series
converges. As expected, solving Poisson equation on the density field generated
with LPT displacement provides a more accurate force than the LPT acceleration
itself, as a direct consequence of the faster convergence of the LPT series for
the positions than for the accelerations. This may provide a clue on improving
standard LPT predictions. Our investigations represent a very needed first step

estimating, at leading order in time and space the proper backreaction on the

general linearized higher-curvature gravities. These propagate, in addition to
the usual graviton, a spin-0 mode as well as a massive ghost-like spin-2 one.
When the latter is absent, the theory is unitary and the dual-pairs principle
is respected. In particular, we find that the number and types of charges
remain the same as for Einstein gravity, and that they correspond to continuous
generalizations of the Einsteinian ones.

networks at scale. Through clever reuse of intermediate information,
backpropagation facilitates training through gradient computation at a total
cost roughly proportional to running the function, rather than incurring an
additional factor proportional to the number of parameters - which can now be
in the trillions. Naively, one expects that quantum measurement collapse
entirely rules out the reuse of quantum information as in backpropagation. But
recent developments in shadow tomography, which assumes access to multiple
copies of a quantum state, have challenged that notion. Here, we investigate
whether parameterized quantum models can train as efficiently as classical
neural networks. We show that achieving backpropagation scaling is impossible
without access to multiple copies of a state. With this added ability, we
introduce an algorithm with foundations in shadow tomography that matches
backpropagation scaling in quantum resources while reducing classical auxiliary
computational costs to open problems in shadow tomography. These results
highlight the nuance of reusing quantum information for practical purposes and
clarify the unique difficulties in training large quantum models, which could
alter the course of quantum machine learning.

The relation between $\xi_{ion}^*$ and sSFR shows a monotonic increase from

all the fields of astrophysics and cosmology. The development of modern tools
that target the largest existing computing systems and exploit state-of-the-art
numerical methods and algorithms is thus crucial. In this paper, we introduce
the fully open-source highly-parallel, versatile, and modular coupled
hydrodynamics, gravity, cosmology, and galaxy-formation code Swift. The
software package exploits hybrid task-based parallelism, asynchronous
communications, and domain-decomposition algorithms based on balancing the
workload, rather than the data, to efficiently exploit modern high-performance
computing cluster architectures. Gravity is solved for using a
fast-multipole-method, optionally coupled to a particle mesh solver in Fourier
space to handle periodic volumes. For gas evolution, multiple modern flavours
of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics are implemented. Swift also evolves
neutrinos using a state-of-the-art particle-based method. Two complementary
networks of sub-grid models for galaxy formation as well as extensions to
simulate planetary physics are also released as part of the code. An extensive
set of output options, including snapshots, light-cones, power spectra, and a
coupling to structure finders are also included. We describe the overall code
architecture, summarize the consistency and accuracy tests that were performed,
and demonstrate the excellent weak-scaling performance of the code using a
representative cosmological hydrodynamical problem with $\approx$$300$ billion
particles. The code is released to the community alongside extensive
documentation for both users and developers, a large selection of example test
problems, and a suite of tools to aid in the analysis of large simulations run
with Swift.

inflation through a similar mechanism that the seed of observed large scale
structures are produced from the inflaton field. The accumulated energy density
of the corresponding excited modes, which is subdominant during inflation,
dominates energy density of the universe later around the time of matter and
radiation equality and plays the role of dark matter. For spin-2 spectator
fields, Higuchi bound may seem to prevent excitation of such light modes since
deviation of the inflationary background from the exact de Sitter spacetime is
very small. However, sizable interactions with the inflaton field breaks (part
of) isometries of the de Sitter space in the inflationary background and
relaxes the Higuchi bound. Looking for this possibility in the context of
effective field theory of inflation, we suggest a dark matter model consisting
of spin-2 particles that produce during inflation.

arrays (ULAs) do not change the covariance matrix eigenvalues and the moduli of
the covariance matrix elements, we formulate a number of the new ToIEP problems
of the Hermitian Toeplitz matrix reconstruction, given the moduli of the matrix

case, only two solutions to this problem exist, with the ""non-physical"" one
that in most practical cases could be easily disregarded. The computational
algorithm for the real-valued case is quite simple. For the complex-valued

investigate the statistical convergence of the ad-hoc algorithm with the sample
matrices instead of the true ones. The proposed ad-hoc algorithms require the
so-called ""strong"" or ""argumental"" convergence, which means a large enough
required sample volume that reduces the errors in the estimated covariance

Bayesian inference on a sample of 174 planets for which either the full
three-dimensional stellar obliquity has been measured (72 planets) or for which
only the sky-projected stellar obliquity has been measured (102 planets). We
investigated whether the obliquities are best described by a Rayleigh

well-aligned systems and a different distribution representing misaligned
systems. The mixture models are strongly favored over the single-component
distribution. For the misaligned component, we tried an isotropic distribution
and a distribution peaked at 90$^\circ$, and found the evidence to be
essentially the same for both models. Thus, our Bayesian inference engine did
not find strong evidence favoring a ""perpendicular peak,'' unlike the
frequentist tests. We also investigated selection biases that affect the

there is still a lack of investigation into how GAT learns syntactic knowledge

The experiments show that better performance can be achieved by appropriately
increasing the number of attention heads with two GAT layers. With more than
two layers, learning suffers. Moreover, GAT is more competitive in training

incorporation of modeling explicit syntactic knowledge and the possibility of

  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Extreme, young stellar populations are considered the primary contributor to
cosmic reionization. However, how Lyman-continuum (LyC) escapes these galaxies
remains highly elusive because LyC escape can vary on sub-galactic scales that
are technically challenging to observe in LyC emitters. We investigate the
Sunburst Arc: a strongly lensed, LyC emitter at $z=2.37$. This galaxy reveals
the exceptionally small scale (tens of parsecs) physics of LyC escape thanks to
high magnification from strong lensing. Analyzing HST broadband and narrowband
imaging, we find that the small ($<$100 pc) LyC leaking region shows distinctly
extreme properties: a very blue UV slope ($\beta=-2.9\pm0.1$), high ionization
state ([OIII]$\lambda 5007$/[OII]$\lambda 3727=11\pm3$ and [OIII]$\lambda
5007$/H$\beta=6.8\pm0.4$), strong oxygen emission (EW([OIII])$=1095\pm 40
\r{A}$), and high Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction ($0.3\pm 0.03$), none of which
are found in any non-leaking regions of the galaxy. Moreover, a UV slope
comparison with starburst population models indicates that the leaking region's
UV emission consists of nearly ``pure'' stellar light with minimal
contamination from surrounding nebular continuum emission and dust extinction.
These results suggest a highly directional LyC escape such that LyC is produced
and escapes from a small, extreme starburst region where the stellar feedback
from an ionizing star cluster may create an anisotropic ``pencil beam'' viewing
geometry in the surrounding gas. As a result, unabsorbed LyC directly escapes
through these perforated hole(s). Importantly, such anisotropic escape
processes imply that unfavorable sightline effects are a crucial contributor to
the significant scatters between galaxy properties and LyC escape fraction in
observations and that strong lensing uniquely reveals the small-scale physics
that regulates the ionizing budget of galaxies for reionization.

they establish relations between individual fitness and population density. The

positive density dependence in the population per capita growth rate. The
spatial structure is key to determining whether and to which extent a component
Allee effect will manifest at the demographic level because it determines how
individuals interact with one another. However, existing spatial models to
study the Allee effect impose a fixed spatial structure, which limits our
understanding of how a component Allee effect and the spatial dynamics jointly
determine the existence of demographic Allee effects. To fill this gap, we
introduce a spatially-explicit theoretical framework where spatial structure
and population dynamics are emergent properties of the individual-level
demographic rates. Depending on the intensity of the individual processes the
population exhibits a variety of spatial patterns that determine the
demographic-level by-products of an existing individual-level component Allee
effect. We find that aggregation increases population abundance and allows
populations to survive in harsher environments and at lower global population
densities when compared with uniformly distributed organisms. Moreover,
aggregation can prevent the component Allee effect from manifesting at the
population level or restrict it to the level of each independent group. These
results provide a mechanistic understanding of how component Allee effects
operate for different spatial population structures and show at the population

pressure, the electric potential, and the wave energy to the solar wind proton
acceleration observed by PSP between 13.3 and ~100 solar radii (RS). The proton
pressure provides a natural kinematic driver of the outflow. The ambipolar
electric potential acts to couple the electron pressure to the protons,
providing another definite proton acceleration term. Fluctuations and waves,
while inherently dynamic, can act as an additional effective steady-state
pressure term. To analyze the contributions of these terms, we utilize radial
binning of single-point PSP measurements, as well as repeated crossings of the
same stream at different distances on individual PSP orbits (i.e. ""fast radial
scans""). In agreement with previous work, we find that the electric potential
contains sufficient energy to fully explain the acceleration of the slower wind
streams. On the other hand, we find that the wave pressure plays an
increasingly important role in the faster wind streams. The combination of

information across various timescales. This could be achieved by a hierarchical
organization of temporal processing, as reported for primates; however, it is
open whether this hierarchical organization generalizes to sensory processing
across species. Here, we studied signatures of temporal processing along the
anatomical hierarchy in the mouse visual system. We found that the intrinsic
and information timescales of spiking activity, which serve as proxies for how
long information is stored in neural activity, increased along the anatomical
hierarchy. Using information theory, we also quantified the predictability of
neural spiking. The predictability is expected to be higher for longer
integration of past information, but low for redundancy reduction in an
efficient code. We found that predictability decreases along the anatomical
cortical hierarchy, which is in line with efficient coding, but in contrast to
the expectation of higher predictability for areas with higher timescales.
Mechanistically, we could explain these results in a basic network model, where
the increase in timescales arises from increasing network recurrence, while
recurrence also reduces predictability if the model's input is correlated. The
model thus suggests that timescales are mainly a network-intrinsic effect,
whereas information-theoretic predictability depends on other sources such as
(correlated) sensory stimuli. This is supported by a comparison of experimental
data from different stimulus conditions. Our results show a clear hierarchy
across mouse visual cortex, and thus suggest that hierarchical temporal
processing presents a general organization principle across mammals.

corresponding to the thin and thick discs. In particular, we show how key
properties of the Solar vicinity can be obtained by secular evolution, with no
need for external or special events, like galaxy mergers or paucity in star
formation. This concerns the long established double-branch behaviour of
[alpha/Fe] vs metallicity and the recently found non-monotonic evolution of the
stellar abundance gradient, evaluated at the birth radii of stars. We extend
the discussion to other abundance ratios and we suggest a classification
scheme, based on the nature of the corresponding yields (primary vs secondary

long-lived ones). The latter property is critical in determining the single- or
double- branch behavior of an elementary abundance ratio in the Solar
neighborhood. We underline the high diagnostic potential of this finding, which
can help to separate clearly elements with sources evolving on different
timescales and help determining the site of e.g. the r-process(es). We define
the ""abundance distance"" between the thin and thick disc sequences as an

galaxies lie significantly above the relation whereas quenched galaxies lie
below the sequence. In order to study the evolution of galaxies on the SFR-M*

episodes of star formation can be pinpointed by the existence of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs). Here we present sensitive [CI]-nondetections of z$\sim$2 ultra
luminous infrared (ULIRG) GRB host galaxies. We find that our GRB hosts have
similar molecular masses to those of other ULIRGs. However, unlike other
ULIRGs, the GRB hosts are located at the MS or only a factor of a few above it.
Hence, our GRB hosts are caught in the transition toward the SB phase. This is
further supported by the estimated depletion times, which are similar to those
of other transitioning galaxies. The GRB hosts are [CI]-dark galaxies, defined
as having a [CI]/CO temperature brightness ratio of <0.1. Such a low [CI]/CO
ratio has been found in high-density environments (nH > 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) where
CO is shielded from photodissociation, leading to under-abundances of [CI].

Following on the steps of our initial work, we explore the fragility of such
disc structures in intermediate-mass-ratio dry encounters using the previously
constructed $N$-body model of the Fornax galaxy NGC 1381 (FCC 170), which hosts
both a thin galactic disc and a NSD. We dismiss major and minor encounters, as
the former were previously shown to easily destroy thin-disc structures,
whereas the latter take several Hubble times to complete in the specific case
of FCC 170. The kinematics and structure of the thin galactic disc are
dramatically altered by the mergers, whereas the NSD shows a remarkable
resilience, exhibiting only a smooth increase of its size when compared to the
model evolved in isolation. Our results suggest that thin galactic discs are
better tracers for intermediate-mass-ratio mergers, while NSDs may be more
useful for major encounters. Based on our simulations and previous analysis of
the stellar populations, we concluded that FCC 170 has not experienced any
intermediate-mass-ratio dry encounters for at least $\sim$10 Gyr, as indicated

further contribute sensitivity analysis strategies for investigating the

science, coinciding with technological advancements that make it simple to
deploy study designs such as daily diary and ecological momentary assessments.
IL data are characterized by a rapid rate of data collection (1+ collections
per day), over a period of time, allowing for the capture of the dynamics that
underlie psychological and behavioral processes. One powerful framework for
analyzing IL data is state-space modeling, where observed variables are
considered measurements for underlying states (i.e., latent variables) that
change together over time. However, state-space modeling has typically relied
on continuous measurements, whereas psychological data often comes in the form
of ordinal measurements such as Likert scale items. In this manuscript, we
develop a general estimating approach for state-space models with ordinal
measurements, specifically focusing on a graded response model for Likert scale
items. We evaluate the performance of our model and estimator against that of
the commonly used ``linear approximation'' model, which treats ordinal
measurements as though they are continuous. We find that our model resulted in
unbiased estimates of the state dynamics, while the linear approximation
resulted in strongly biased estimates of the state dynamics

with the target dataset to amplify the acquisition of highly relevant features.
Through a strategic modification of the model's final layer, we enable the
simultaneous classification of both datasets without the necessity to treat
them as disparate tasks. To realize this, we formulate a loss function that
includes an inter-group penalty. We conducted experimental evaluations using
the InceptionV3 and ResNet50 models, designating the UFOP-HVD hop leaf dataset

method exhibited a substantial performance advantage over models without

upper bound of graviton mass by the analysis of the stellar orbits around the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the Galactic Center (GC) in the framework of
Yukawa gravity. Main motivation for this study is recent detection of
Schwarzschild precession in the orbit of S2 star around the SMBH at the GC by
the GRAVITY Collaboration in 2020. They indicated that the orbital precession
of the S2 star is close to the General Relativity (GR) prediction, but with
possible small deviation from it, and parametrized this effect by introducing
an ad hoc factor in the parameterized post-Newtonian (PPN) equations of motion.
Here we use the value of this factor presented by GRAVITY in order to perform
two-body simulations of the stellar orbits in massive gravity using equations
of motion in the modified PPN formalism, as well as to constrain the range of
massive interaction $\Lambda$. From the obtained values of $\Lambda$, and
assuming that it corresponds to the Compton wavelength of graviton, we then
calculated new estimates for the upper bound of graviton mass which are found
to be independent, but consistent with the LIGO's estimate of graviton mass
from the first gravitational wave (GW) signal GW150914. We also performed
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations in order to constrain the bounds on
graviton mass in the case of a small deviation of the stellar orbits from the
corresponding GR predictions and showed that our method could further improve
previous estimates for upper bounds on the graviton mass. It is also
demonstrated that such analysis of the observed orbits of S-stars around the GC
in the frame of the Yukawa gravity represents a tool for constraining the upper
bound for the graviton mass, as well as for probing the predictions of GR or
other gravity theories.

accurately estimating the position of wireless devices in indoor environments

further improve generalizability when the dataset is limited. Lastly, we
evaluate the performance of TB-MAML-based localization against conventionally

results unveil the capacity of dynamical noise to enhance the statistical

affect the system's susceptibility to noise and characteristic times-scales.
These results deepen our understanding of how high-order interdependencies may

seven satellite and aerial imagery datasets of varying resolution, that by
simply following the preprocessing steps used in pre-training (precisely, image
sizing and normalization methods), one can achieve significant performance
improvements when evaluating the extracted features on downstream tasks -- an

the first mathematical runtime guarantees have been obtained for this

  In this work, we give the first proven performance guarantees for a classic
optimization problem, the NP-complete bi-objective minimum spanning tree
problem. More specifically, we show that the NSGA-II with population size $N
\ge 4((n-1) w_{\max} + 1)$ computes all extremal points of the Pareto front in
an expected number of $O(m^2 n w_{\max} \log(n w_{\max}))$ iterations, where
$n$ is the number of vertices, $m$ the number of edges, and $w_{\max}$ is the
maximum edge weight in the problem instance. This result confirms, via
mathematical means, the good performance of the NSGA-II observed empirically.
It also shows that mathematical analyses of this algorithm are not only
possible for synthetic benchmark problems, but also for more complex
combinatorial optimization problems.
  As a side result, we also obtain a new analysis of the performance of the
global SEMO algorithm on the bi-objective minimum spanning tree problem, which
improves the previous best result by a factor of $|F|$, the number of extremal
points of the Pareto front, a set that can be as large as $n w_{\max}$. The
main reason for this improvement is our observation that both multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms find the different extremal points in parallel rather
than sequentially, as assumed in the previous proofs.

that involve multi-agent systems due to the need for computational efficiency
as well as general applicability to large-scale systems. However, in the
absence of an explicit global coordinator, it is hard for distributed agents to
determine how to efficiently interact with others. In this paper, we present a
risk-aware decentralized control framework that provides guidance on how much
relative responsibility share (a percentage) an individual agent should take to
avoid collisions with others while moving efficiently without direct
communications. We propose a novel Control Barrier Function (CBF)-inspired risk
measurement to characterize the aggregate risk agents face from potential
collisions under motion uncertainty. We use this measurement to allocate
responsibility shares among agents dynamically and develop risk-aware
decentralized safe controllers. In this way, we are able to leverage the
flexibility of robots with lower risk to improve the motion flexibility for
those with higher risk, thus achieving improved collective safety. We
demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our proposed approach through two

infer message formats from the implementation of protocol parsers. In this
work, we focus on a class of extremely challenging protocols whose formats are
described via constraint-enhanced regular expressions and parsed using

on carefully-designed rules. The evaluation results show that we can infer a

inference has become a pivotal aspect as models become more complex and are
deployed in diverse applications. Among these, autoregressive models stand out
due to their state-of-the-art performance in numerous generative tasks. These
models, by design, harness a temporal dependency structure, where the current
token's probability distribution is conditioned on preceding tokens. This
inherently sequential characteristic, however, adheres to the Markov Chain
assumption and lacks temporal parallelism, which poses unique challenges.
Particularly in industrial contexts where inference requests, following a
Poisson time distribution, necessitate diverse response lengths, this absence
of parallelism is more profound. Existing solutions, such as dynamic batching
and concurrent model instances, nevertheless, come with severe overheads and a
lack of flexibility, these coarse-grained methods fall short of achieving
optimal latency and throughput. To address these shortcomings, we propose
Flavor -- a temporal fusion framework for efficient inference in autoregressive

temporality of requests and employing an efficient memory shuffle algorithm,
Flover achieves up to 11x faster inference on GPT models compared to the
cutting-edge solutions provided by NVIDIA Triton FasterTransformer. Crucially,
by leveraging the advanced tensor parallel technique, Flover proves efficacious
across diverse computational landscapes, from single-GPU setups to multi-node

The design of StructNet-CE leverages the structure information in the MIMO-OFDM
system, including the repetitive structure of modulation constellation and the
invariant property of symbol classification to inter-stream interference. The
embedded structure information enables StructNet-CE to conduct channel
estimation with a binary classification task and accurately learn channel
coefficients with as few as two pilot OFDM symbols. Experiments show that the
channel estimation performance is significantly improved with the incorporation
of structure knowledge. StructNet-CE is compatible and readily applicable to
current and future wireless networks, demonstrating the effectiveness and
importance of combining machine learning techniques with domain knowledge for
wireless communication systems.

tool for detecting network structures for a variety of problems, including the
estimation of functional neuronal connectivity from two-photon calcium imaging
data. However, in the context of calcium imaging, technological limitations
only allow for partially overlapping layers of neurons in a brain region of
interest to be jointly recorded. In this case, graph estimation for the full
data requires inference for edge selection when many pairs of neurons have no
simultaneous observations. This leads to the Graph Quilting problem, which
seeks to estimate a graph in the presence of block-missingness in the empirical
covariance matrix. Solutions for the Graph Quilting problem have previously
been studied for Gaussian graphical models; however, neural activity data from
calcium imaging are often non-Gaussian, thereby requiring a more flexible
modeling approach. Thus, in our work, we study two approaches for nonparanormal
Graph Quilting based on the Gaussian copula graphical model, namely a maximum
likelihood procedure and a low-rank based framework. We provide theoretical
guarantees on edge recovery for the former approach under similar conditions to
those previously developed for the Gaussian setting, and we investigate the
empirical performance of both methods using simulations as well as real data
calcium imaging data. Our approaches yield more scientifically meaningful
functional connectivity estimates compared to existing Gaussian graph quilting
methods for this calcium imaging data set.

position angle $\Psi$. Here we report the discovery of a $\Psi_{\mathrm x}$
rotation in the X-ray band in the blazar Mrk 421 at an average flux state.
Across the 5 days of Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of
4-6 and 7-9 June 2022, $\Psi_{\mathrm x}$ rotated in total by $\geq360^\circ$.
Over the two respective date ranges, we find constant, within uncertainties,
rotation rates ($80 \pm 9$ and $91 \pm 8 ^\circ/\rm day$) and polarization
degrees ($\Pi_{\mathrm x}=10\%\pm1\%$). Simulations of a random walk of the
polarization vector indicate that it is unlikely that such rotation(s) are
produced by a stochastic process. The X-ray emitting site does not completely
overlap the radio/infrared/optical emission sites, as no similar rotation of
$\Psi$ was observed in quasi-simultaneous data at longer wavelengths. We
propose that the observed rotation was caused by a helical magnetic structure
in the jet, illuminated in the X-rays by a localized shock propagating along
this helix. The optically emitting region likely lies in a sheath surrounding
an inner spine where the X-ray radiation is released.

analyze multiplicative noise and demonstrate that HMC is insufficient for
isolating thermal and multiplicative noise. However, we show that, with
additional knowledge of the ratio between thermal and multiplicative noise, we
can accurately distinguish between the two types of noise when provided with a
sufficiently large sampling rate or an amplitude of multiplicative noise
smaller than thermal noise. This finding results in a situation that initially
seems counterintuitive. When multiplicative noise dominates the noise spectrum,
we can successfully estimate the parameters for such systems after adding

contributing to the beta function. Our data set includes all primitive graphs
up to 13 loops, and non-complete samples up to 18 loops, with an accuracy of

  We implement all known symmetries of the period in a new computer program and
count them up to 14 loops. We discover some combinations of symmetries that had
been overlooked earlier, resulting in an overall slightly lower count of
independent graphs than previously assumed.
  Using the numerical data, we examine the distribution of Feynman periods. We
confirm the leading asymptotic growth of the average period with growing loop
order. At high loop order, a limiting distribution is reached for the
amplitudes near the mean. We construct two different models to approximate this
distribution. A small class of graphs, most notably the zigzags, grows
significantly faster than the mean and causes the limiting distribution to have
divergent moments even when normalized to unit mean. We examine the relation
between the period and various properties of the underlying graphs. We confirm

  Bernstein Polynomial Activations and Precise Bound Propagation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Formal certification of Neural Networks (NNs) is crucial for ensuring their
safety, fairness, and robustness. Unfortunately, on the one hand, sound and
complete certification algorithms of ReLU-based NNs do not scale to large-scale
NNs. On the other hand, incomplete certification algorithms are easier to
compute, but they result in loose bounds that deteriorate with the depth of NN,
which diminishes their effectiveness. In this paper, we ask the following
question; can we replace the ReLU activation function with one that opens the
door to incomplete certification algorithms that are easy to compute but can
produce tight bounds on the NN's outputs? We introduce DeepBern-Nets, a class
of NNs with activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials instead of the
commonly used ReLU activation. Bernstein polynomials are smooth and
differentiable functions with desirable properties such as the so-called range
enclosure and subdivision properties. We design a novel algorithm, called
Bern-IBP, to efficiently compute tight bounds on DeepBern-Nets outputs. Our
approach leverages the properties of Bernstein polynomials to improve the
tractability of neural network certification tasks while maintaining the
accuracy of the trained networks. We conduct comprehensive experiments in
adversarial robustness and reachability analysis settings to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed Bernstein polynomial activation in enhancing the
certification process. Our proposed framework achieves high certified accuracy
for adversarially-trained NNs, which is often a challenging task for certifiers
of ReLU-based NNs. Moreover, using Bern-IBP bounds for certified training
results in NNs with state-of-the-art certified accuracy compared to ReLU
networks. This work establishes Bernstein polynomial activation as a promising
alternative for improving NN certification tasks across various applications.

that collage pasting improves precision and recall beyond related methods, such

we find that collage pasting is vulnerable to certain out-of-distribution

invoked to explain it. In this paper, we try to clarify the issue starting from
Clausius thermodynamical entropy and deriving from it Boltzmann statistical
entropy for the ideal gas. This approach appears interesting for two reasons:
Firstly, it provides a direct heuristic link between thermodynamical and
statistical expressions of entropy that is missing in the usual approach. In
second place, it explicitly reminds that also statistical entropy is defined
with respect to a reference state, chosen to be the quantum-mechanical (T=0)
ground state of the N-particles in a box. Both factors $h^{3N}$ and $N!$ at the
denominator of the statistical entropy are a consequence of the quantum nature
of the reference state: in particular, the $N!$ is not related to the particle
identity, but to the identity of the boundary conditions on the
quantum-mechanical ground-state momenta, and to a general statistical
maximization principle. The introduction of a reference state also allows to
reinterpret the standard case of two mixing gases.

able-bodied sub-movements. Movement initiation proceeds comparably to the
reference curve in two- and three-dimensional representations of mild

systems, where slots and corresponding values are usually language-, task- and
domain-specific. Therefore, extending the system to any new
language-domain-task configuration requires (re)running an expensive and
resource-intensive data annotation process. To mitigate the inherent data
scarcity issue, current research on multilingual ToD assumes that sufficient
English-language annotated data are always available for particular tasks and
domains, and thus operates in a standard cross-lingual transfer setup. In this
work, we depart from this often unrealistic assumption. We examine challenging
scenarios where such transfer-enabling English annotated data cannot be
guaranteed, and focus on bootstrapping multilingual data-efficient slot
labelers in transfer-free scenarios directly in the target languages without
any English-ready data. We propose a two-stage slot labeling approach (termed
TWOSL) which transforms standard multilingual sentence encoders into effective
slot labelers. In Stage 1, relying on SL-adapted contrastive learning with only
a handful of SL-annotated examples, we turn sentence encoders into
task-specific span encoders. In Stage 2, we recast SL from a token
classification into a simpler, less data-intensive span classification task.
Our results on two standard multilingual TOD datasets and across diverse
languages confirm the effectiveness and robustness of TWOSL. It is especially
effective for the most challenging transfer-free few-shot setups, paving the
way for quick and data-efficient bootstrapping of multilingual slot labelers
for ToD.

increasingly visible climate change. Its basis is identifying emission
responsibility during power allocation by the carbon emission flow (CEF) model.
However, the main challenge of CEF application is the intractable nonlinear
relationship between carbon emission and power allocation. So this paper
leverages the high approximation capability and the mixed-integer linear
programming (MILP) representability of the deep neural networks to tackle the
complex CEF model in carbon-electricity coordinated optimization. The compact
constraint learning approach is proposed to learn the mapping from power
injection to bus emission with sparse neural networks (SNNs). Then the trained
SNNs are transformed equivalently as MILP constraints in the downstream
optimization. In light of the ``high emission with high price'' principle, the
blocked carbon price mechanism is designed to price emissions from the demand

proposes the carbon-aware energy management model in the tractable MILP form to
unlock the carbon reduction potential from the demand side. The case study
verifies the approximation accuracy and sparsity of SNN with fewer parameters
for accelerating optimization solution and reduction effectiveness of

Suggestions have been made to address this problem via revisions to the

undergo a costly re-vamp of their system, and in addition it might not offer
the flexibility necessary to capture the many types of fairness notions and
other constraints that advertisers would like to ensure. Instead, we consider
alterations that make no change to the platform mechanism and instead change
the bidding strategies used by advertisers. We compare two natural fairness
objectives: one in which the advertisers must treat groups equally when bidding
in order to achieve a yield with group-parity guarantees, and another in which
the bids are not constrained and only the yield must satisfy parity
constraints. We show that requiring parity with respect to both bids and yield
can result in an arbitrarily large decrease in efficiency compared to requiring
equal yield proportions alone. We find that autobidding is a natural way to
realize this latter objective and show how existing work in this area can be
extended to provide efficient bidding strategies that provide high utility
while satisfying group parity constraints as well as deterministic and
randomized rounding techniques to uphold these guarantees. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solutions on data adapted from a

better semantic representation for digital transmission, a novel non-linear

we derive a higher-order discretization method, simple corner balance (in

We consider here that part of $f$ electrons are localized (orbital 1) while
another part (orbital 2) are delocalized, as it is frequent in uranium systems.
Then, only electrons in the localized orbital 1 interact through exchange
interaction with the neighboring ones, while electrons in orbital 2 are coupled
with conduction electrons through a Kondo interaction. We obtain a solution
where ferromagnetism and Kondo effect coexist for small values of an applied
transverse magnetic field for $T\rightarrow0$. Increasing the transverse field,
two situations can be obtained when Kondo coupling vanishes: first, a
metamagnetic transition occurs just before or at the same time of the fully

-Mesh(G,T_0))$ is shown to equal $\Sigma_{j=0}^{N} \ (-1)^j \ ST_{j}(G,T_0)\
(X-1)^{N-j} \ (\star)$ \ where $ST_j(G,T_0)$ is the number of spanning trees of
$G$ meeting $E(G-T_0)$ in j edges and $N=|E(G-T_0)|$. As a consequence, there
are Tutte-type deletion-contraction formulae for computing this polynomial.
Additionally, $Mesh(G,T_0) -Id$ is of the special form $Y^t \cdot Y$; so the
eigenvalues of the mesh matrix $Mesh(G,T_0)$ are all real and are furthermore
be shown to be $\ge +1$. It is shown that $Y \cdot Y^t$, called the mesh
Laplacian, is a generalization of the standard graph Kirchhoff Laplacian
$\Delta(H)= Deg -Adj$ of a graph $H$.For example, $(\star)$ generalizes the all
minors matrix tree theorem for graphs $H$ and gives a deletion-contraction
formula for the characteristic polynomial of $\Delta(H)$. This generalization
is explored in some detail. The smallest positive eigenvalue of the mesh
Laplacian, a measure of flux, is estimated, thus extending the classical
inequality for the Kirchoff Laplacian of graphs.

comprising numerous interacting components. In the context of data science, SM
allows us to model complex interactions among variables within a dataset. By
leveraging these tools, data scientists can gain a profound understanding of

to drive accurate predictions and enhance decision-making across various

absolute age of Saturn's rings, including the extrinsic micrometeoroid flux at
Saturn, the volume fraction of non-icy pollutants in the rings, and the total
ring mass. These three factors constrain the ring age to be no more than a few
100 Myr (Kempf et al., 2023). Observations during the Cassini Grand Finale also
showed that the rings are losing mass to the planet at a prodigious rate. Some
of the mass flux falls as ""ring rain"" at high latitudes. However, the influx in
ring rain is considerably less than the total measured mass influx of 4800 to
45000 kg/s at lower latitudes (Waite et al., 2018).
  In addition to polluting the rings, micrometeoroid impacts lead to ballistic
transport, the mass and angular momentum transport due to net exchanges of
meteoroid impact ejecta. Because the ejecta are predominantly prograde, they
carry net angular momentum outward. As a result, ring material drifts inward
toward the planet. Here, for the first time, we use a simple model to quantify
this radial mass inflow rate for dense rings and find that, for plausible
choices of parameters, ballistic transport and mass loading by meteoroids can
produce a total inward flux of material in the inner B ring and in the C ring
that is on the order of a few x 10^3 to a few x 10^4 kg/s, in agreement with
measurements during the Cassini Grand Finale. From these mass inflow rates, we
estimate that the remaining ring lifetime is ~15 to 400 Myr. Combining this
with a revised pollution age of ~120 Myr, we conclude that Saturn's rings are
not only young but ephemeral and probably started their evolution on a similar
timescale to their pollution age with an initial mass of one to a few Mimas
masses.

Currently, most existing methods for customizing pre-trained text-to-image

natural language understanding, tremendous progress has been made by treating
programming language as another sort of natural language and training LLMs on
corpora of program code. However, programs are essentially different from texts
after all, in a sense that they are normally heavily structured and
syntax-strict. In particular, programs and their basic units (i.e., functions

inputs and possible outputs/behaviors represents the functions/subroutines and
profiles the program as a whole. Therefore, we propose to incorporate such a

multimodal sensor fusion method for real-time location-dependent defect

convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed to fuse acoustic and visual

extraction procedures are no longer required, and the raw melt pool images and
acoustic signals are fused directly by the hybrid CNN model, which achieved the
highest defect prediction accuracy (98.5 %) without the thermal sensing
modality. Moreover, unlike previous region-based quality prediction, the
proposed hybrid CNN can detect the onset of defect occurrences. The defect
prediction outcomes are synchronized and registered with in-situ acquired robot
tool-center-point (TCP) data, which enables localized defect identification.
The proposed multimodal sensor fusion method offers a robust solution for

emission, these new observations show that this surrounding emission is
significantly more spatially extended than indicated by previous

The estimated HI mass is larger than 100M_sun, invalidating an origin from the
host star itself or its ejecta for the emitting material. We discuss the
possibility that the extended HI emission stems from the interstellar medium

detections of HI absorption features lying near and blueward of the systemic

is subjected to an abrupt perturbation of external forcing, its spectrum
evolves on a ``fast'' dynamic time scale of $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$, with
$\varepsilon$ a measure of wave steepness. This observation poses a challenge
to wave turbulence theory that predicts an evolution with a kinetic time scale
of $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$. We revisit this unresolved problem by studying the
same situation in the context of a one-dimensional Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak (MMT)
equation with gravity wave dispersion relation. Our results show that the
kinetic and dynamic time scales can both be realised, with the former and
latter occurring for weaker and stronger forcing perturbations, respectively.
The transition between the two regimes corresponds to a critical forcing
perturbation, with which the spectral evolution time scale drops to the same
order as the linear wave period (of some representative mode). Such fast
spectral evolution is mainly induced by a far-from-stationary state after a
sufficiently strong forcing perturbation is applied. We further develop a
set-based interaction analysis to show that the inertial-range modal evolution
in the studied cases is dominated by their (mostly non-local) interactions with
the low-wavenumber ``condensate'' induced by the forcing perturbation. The
results obtained in this work should be considered to provide significant

factors like pose and skin tone, the utilization of pseudo-labels generated by
clustering algorithms is an effective way in unsupervised domain adaptation.
However, they always miss some hard positive samples. Supervision on
pseudo-labeled samples attracts them towards their prototypes and would cause
an intra-domain gap between pseudo-labeled samples and the remaining unlabeled
samples within target domain, which results in the lack of discrimination in
face recognition. In this paper, considering the particularity of face
recognition, we propose a novel adversarial information network (AIN) to
address it. First, a novel adversarial mutual information (MI) loss is proposed
to alternately minimize MI with respect to the target classifier and maximize
MI with respect to the feature extractor. By this min-max manner, the positions
of target prototypes are adaptively modified which makes unlabeled images
clustered more easily such that intra-domain gap can be mitigated. Second, to
assist adversarial MI loss, we utilize a graph convolution network to predict
linkage likelihoods between target data and generate pseudo-labels. It
leverages valuable information in the context of nodes and can achieve more
reliable results. The proposed method is evaluated under two scenarios, i.e.,
domain adaptation across poses and image conditions, and domain adaptation
across faces with different skin tones. Extensive experiments show that AIN

efficiently represent functions of type B^n -> D, when the function's range has
many different values. This paper addresses this limitation through a new data
structure called Weighted CFLOBDDs (WCFLOBDDs). WCFLOBDDs extend CFLOBDDs using
insights from the design of Weighted BDDs (WBDDs) -- BDD-like structures with
weights on edges. We show that WCFLOBDDs can be exponentially more succinct
than both WBDDs and CFLOBDDs. We also evaluate WCFLOBDDs for quantum-circuit
simulation, and find that they perform better than WBDDs and CFLOBDDs on most
benchmarks. With a 15-minute timeout, the number of qubits that can be handled
by WCFLOBDDs is 1,048,576 for GHZ (1x over CFLOBDDs, 256x over WBDDs); 262,144
for BV and DJ (2x over CFLOBDDs, 64x over WBDDs); and 2,048 for QFT (128x over
CFLOBDDs, 2x over WBDDs).

dealing with the imbalance of class contributions to loss, we combined the dice

their risk of infection. Such social distancing strategies will depend on
information about the course of the epidemic but also on when they expect the
epidemic to end, for instance due to vaccination. Typically it is difficult to
make optimal decisions, because the available information is incomplete and
uncertain. Here, we show how optimal decision making depends on knowledge about
vaccination timing in a differential game in which individual decision making
gives rise to Nash equilibria, and the arrival of the vaccine is described by a
probability distribution. We show that the earlier the vaccination is expected
to happen and the more precisely the timing of the vaccination is known, the
stronger is the incentive to socially distance. In particular, equilibrium
social distancing only meaningfully deviates from the no-vaccination
equilibrium course if the vaccine is expected to arrive before the epidemic
would have run its course. We demonstrate how the probability distribution of
the vaccination time acts as a generalised form of discounting, with the
special case of an exponential vaccination time distribution directly
corresponding to regular exponential discounting.

Learning in games considers how multiple agents maximize their own rewards
through repeated plays of games. Especially in two-player zero-sum games, where
agents compete with each other for their rewards, the reward of the agent
depends on the opponent's strategy. Thus, a critical problem emerges when both
agents learn their strategy following standard algorithms such as replicator
dynamics and gradient ascent; their learning dynamics often draw cycles and
cannot converge to their optimal strategies, i.e., the Nash equilibrium. We
tackle this problem with a novel perspective on asymmetry in learning
algorithms between the agents. We consider with-memory games where the agents
can store the played actions in their memories in order to choose their
subsequent actions. In such games, we focus on the asymmetry in memory
capacities between the agents. Interestingly, we demonstrate that learning
dynamics converge to the Nash equilibrium when the agents have different memory
capacities, from theoretical and experimental aspects. Moreover, we give an
interpretation of this convergence; the agent with a longer memory can use a
more complex strategy, endowing the utility of the other with strict concavity.

is to restore a high-quality (HQ) image from its degraded low-quality (LQ)

posed problem, creating an ambiguous solution space. This motivates the
investigation and incorporation of prior knowledge in order to effectively
constrain the solution space and enhance the quality of the restored images. In
spite of the pervasive use of hand-crafted and learned priors in IR, limited
attention has been paid to the incorporation of knowledge from large-scale
foundation models. In this paper, we for the first time leverage the prior
knowledge of the state-of-the-art segment anything model (SAM) to boost the

particular, the choice of SAM is based on its robustness to image degradations,
such that HQ semantic masks can be extracted from it. In order to leverage
semantic priors and enhance restoration quality, we propose a lightweight SAM
prior tuning (SPT) unit. This plug-and-play component allows us to effectively
integrate semantic priors into existing IR networks, resulting in significant
improvements in restoration quality. As the only trainable module in our

intelligent surface (RIS) based SR system is considered, where the RIS is used
not only to assist the primary active communication, but also for passive

investigate the EE trade-off between active and passive communications, by
characterizing the EE region. To gain some insights, we first derive the
maximum achievable individual EEs of the primary transmitter (PT) and RIS,
respectively, and then analyze the asymptotic performance by exploiting the
channel hardening effect. To characterize the non-trivial EE trade-off, we
formulate an optimization problem to find the Pareto boundary of the EE region
by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, power allocation and the
passive beamforming of RIS. The formulated problem is non-convex, and an
efficient algorithm is proposed by decomposing it into a series of subproblems
by using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation

input that combines the semantics of its ancestors in a novel manner and has
toxic nature by construction. This fused input is then used for validating
multimedia content moderation software. We realized Semantic Fusion as DUO, a
practical content moderation software testing tool. In our evaluation, we
employ DUO to test five commercial content moderation software and two

a pre-trained UniData2vec and a phoneme-to-word Transcoder. Different from
UniSpeech, UniData2vec replaces the quantized discrete representations with
continuous and contextual representations from a teacher model for
phonetically-aware pre-training. Then, Transcoder learns to translate phonemes
to words with the aid of extra texts, enabling direct word generation.
Experiments on Common Voice show that UniData2vec reduces PER by 5.3% compared
to UniSpeech, while Transcoder yields a 14.4% WER reduction compared to
grapheme fine-tuning.

issue becomes even more pronounced in low-resource settings, such as
cross-lingual transfer. With the existing faithful metrics focusing on English,
even measuring the extent of this phenomenon in cross-lingual settings is hard.
To address this, we first develop a novel metric, mFACT, evaluating the
faithfulness of non-English summaries, leveraging translation-based transfer

effective method to reduce hallucinations with a cross-lingual transfer, which
weighs the loss of each training example by its faithfulness score. Through
extensive experiments in multiple languages, we demonstrate that mFACT is the

one-dimensional interacting Stark model with nonreciprocal hoppings having
time-reversal symmetry, the properties of which are boundary dependent. Under
periodic boundary conditions (PBC), such a model exhibits three types of phase
transitions: the real-complex transition of eigenenergies, the topological
phase transition, and the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition. The real-complex
and topological phase transitions occur at the same point in the thermodynamic
limit, but do not coincide with the non-Hermitian Stark MBL transition, which
is quite different from the non-Hermitian disordered cases. By the level
statistics, the system undergoes from the Ginibre ensemble (GE) to Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble (GOE) to Possion ensemble (PE) transitions with the
increase of the linear tilt potential's strength $\gamma$. The real-complex
transition of the eigenvalues is accompanied by the GE-to-GOE transition in the
ergodic regime. Moreover, the second transition of the level statistics
corresponds to the occurrence of non-Hermitian Stark MBL. We demonstrate that
the non-Hermitian Stark MBL is robust and shares many similarities with
disorder-induced MBL, which several existing characteristic quantities of the
spectral statistics and eigenstate properties can confirm. The dynamical
evolutions of the entanglement entropy and the density imbalance can
distinguish the real-complex and Stark MBL transitions. Finally, we find that
our system under open boundary conditions lacks a real-complex transition, and
the transition of non-Hermitian Stark MBL is the same as that under PBCs.

interaction between the shock wave and the separated boundary layer. This flow
phenomenon is considered to be highly detrimental during flight and poses a
significant risk to the structural strength and fatigue life of aircraft. Up to
now, there has been a lack of an accurate, efficient, and intuitive metric to
predict buffet and impose a feasible constraint on aerodynamic design. In this
paper, a Physics-Assisted Variational Autoencoder (PAVAE) is proposed to
identify dominant features of transonic buffet, which combines unsupervised
reduced-order modeling with additional physical information embedded via a
buffet classifier. Specifically, four models with various weights adjusting the
contribution of the classifier are trained, so as to investigate the impact of
buffet information on the latent space. Statistical results reveal that buffet
state can be determined exactly with just one latent space when a proper weight
of classifier is chosen. The dominant latent space further reveals a strong
relevance with the key flow features located in the boundary layers downstream
of shock. Based on this identification, the displacement thickness at 80%
chordwise location is proposed as a metric for buffet prediction. This metric
achieves an accuracy of 98.5% in buffet state classification, which is more
reliable than the existing separation metric used in design. The proposed
method integrates the benefits of feature extraction, flow reconstruction, and
buffet prediction into a unified framework, demonstrating its potential in

  System","13 pages, 7 figures, submitted to KDD 2023",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  E-commerce search systems such as Taobao Search, the largest e-commerce
searching system in China, aim at providing users with the most preferred items
(e.g., products). Due to the massive data and limited time for response, a
typical industrial ranking system consists of three or more modules, including
matching, pre-ranking, and ranking. The pre-ranking is widely considered a
mini-ranking module, as it needs to rank hundreds of times more items than the
ranking under limited latency. Existing researches focus on building a lighter
model that imitates the ranking model. As such, the metric of a pre-ranking
model follows the ranking model using Area Under ROC (AUC) for offline
evaluation. However, such a metric is inconsistent with online A/B tests in
practice, so engineers have to perform costly online tests to reach a
convincing conclusion. In our work, we rethink the role of the pre-ranking. We
argue that the primary goal of the pre-ranking stage is to return an optimal
unordered set rather than an ordered list of items because it is the ranking
that determines the final exposures. Since AUC measures the quality of an
ordered item list, it is not suitable for evaluating the quality of the output
unordered set. This paper proposes a new evaluation metric called All-Scenario
Hitrate (ASH) for pre-ranking. ASH is proven effective in the offline
evaluation and consistent with online A/B tests based on numerous experiments
in Taobao Search. We also introduce an all-scenario-based multi-objective
learning framework (ASMOL), which improves the ASH significantly. Surprisingly,
the new pre-ranking model can outperforms the ranking model when outputting
thousands of items. The phenomenon validates that the pre-ranking stage should
not imitate the ranking blindly. With the improvements in ASH consistently
translating to online improvement, it makes a 1.2% GMV improvement on Taobao
Search.

powerful multi-modal representations. Towards this, we propose a Relation and
Sensitivity aware representation learning method (RaSa), including two novel
tasks: Relation-Aware learning (RA) and Sensitivity-Aware learning (SA). For
one thing, existing methods cluster representations of all positive pairs
without distinction and overlook the noise problem caused by the weak positive
pairs where the text and the paired image have noise correspondences, thus
leading to overfitting learning. RA offsets the overfitting risk by introducing
a novel positive relation detection task (i.e., learning to distinguish strong
and weak positive pairs). For another thing, learning invariant representation
under data augmentation (i.e., being insensitive to some transformations) is a
general practice for improving representation's robustness in existing methods.
Beyond that, we encourage the representation to perceive the sensitive
transformation by SA (i.e., learning to detect the replaced words), thus
promoting the representation's robustness. Experiments demonstrate that RaSa
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by 6.94%, 4.45% and 15.35% in

We show that by using modest magnetic field strengths (<1.5 T), the

significantly modulated through the application of in-plane magnetic fields, up
to temperatures of 15 K. At low temperatures, an increase in collected
photoluminescence efficiency of >30% is demonstrated, signifying the critical
role of the dark exciton state for light-emitting applications of 2D
perovskites. The exciton fine structure and the degree of
magnetic-field-induced mixing are impacted by the choice of organic spacer
cation, with 4-methoxyphenethylammonium (MeO-PEA) showing the largest effect
due to larger bright-dark exciton splitting. Our results suggest that dark
excitons preferentially form biexcitons depending on the choice of spacer. We
distinguish between interior (bulk) and surface dark-exciton emission, showing
that bright-dark exciton splitting differs between the interior and surface.

Meeting with the adversarial training, the imbalance causes another imbalance

secondary imbalance, adversarial training distorts optimal decision boundaries.
The distortion eventually decreases both accuracy and robustness than
adversarial training. To exclude the effects, we propose a straightforward but

be applied to methods using experience replay. This method conduct adversarial
training to an auxiliary external model for the current task data at each time

self-frequency shift of solitons and generation of breather solitons which have
been verified both theoretically and experimentally. However, when driven in a
normal GVD regime, recent theoretical work predicts that SRS can cause the
locking of switching waves (SWs) and thus support bright moving localized
structures (LSs), which we term as Kerr-Raman solitons (KRSs). Limited by the
design of suitable experimental parameters, experimental observation of the
KRSs is not achieved yet. Here, we provide numerical investigation, and to our
knowledge, the first experimental observation of these SRS enabled KRSs in a
fiber Fabry-Perot (FP) resonator with ultra-low normal GVD. Such Kerr-Raman
solitons exhibit localized temporal features with strong oscillations at ~13
THz local frequency on the top of a flat-top pulse. The corresponding spectrum
is a low-noise and broadband Kerr comb with typical platicon-like spectrum in
the center and two Raman Stokes and anti-Stokes peaks located near 13 THz away
from the center. With such SRS enabled broadband Kerr comb, we have achieved a
KRS spectrum with a repetition rate of ~3.68 GHz and a -40 dB spectral width of
260 nm. The corresponding comb tooth count is >9000, covering the S+C+L
telecommunication bands. Moreover, the formation process of such KRSs is also
revealed, and it is found that the GVD plays a key role in its generation. Our

detectors for dark matter searches have revealed the presence of unusual
delayed pulses in the EL signal in the form of two slow components with time
constants of about 5 and 50 $\mu$s. These components were shown to be present
in the charge signal itself, which clearly indicates that drifting electrons
are temporarily trapped on two states of metastable negative argon ions which
have never been observed before. In this work, using the pressure dependence of
the ratio of slow component contributions measured in experiment, it is shown
that these states are those of two types of metastable negative molecular ions,
$\mathrm{Ar}_2^{*-}(b \ ^4\Sigma_u^-)$ and $\mathrm{Ar}_2^{*-}(a \
^4\Sigma_g^+)$ for the higher and lower energy level respectively.

needed, but few resources exist to assess metrics when they are proposed.
Therefore, we introduce a dataset of human-assessed summary quality facets and
pairwise preferences to encourage and support the development of better
automated evaluation methods for literature review MDS. We take advantage of
community submissions to the Multi-document Summarization for Literature Review
(MSLR) shared task to compile a diverse and representative sample of generated
summaries. We analyze how automated summarization evaluation metrics correlate
with lexical features of generated summaries, to other automated metrics
including several we propose in this work, and to aspects of human-assessed
summary quality. We find that not only do automated metrics fail to capture
aspects of quality as assessed by humans, in many cases the system rankings
produced by these metrics are anti-correlated with rankings according to human

We confirm a significant increase in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of
satellite galaxies with their halo-centric radius, indicating clear evidence of
mass loss due to tidal stripping. Additionally, we find that this mass loss is
strongly dependent on the mass of the satellite galaxies, with satellite
galaxies above $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}/h}$ experiencing more pronounced mass
loss compared to lower mass satellites, reaching 86\% at projected halo-centric
radius $0.5R_{\rm 200c}$. The average mass loss rate, when not considering
halo-centric radius, displays a U-shaped variation with stellar mass, with
galaxies of approximately $4\times10^{10}~{\rm M_{\odot}/h}$ exhibiting the
least mass loss, around 60\%. We compare our results with state-of-the-art
hydrodynamical numerical simulations and find that the satellite galaxy
stellar-to-halo mass ratio in the outskirts of galaxy clusters is higher

shown that fully transformer-based models that adopt attention mechanisms to
learn in-layer cross-model interaction can demonstrate impressive performance
on various cross-modal downstream tasks. However, they ignored that the
semantic information of the different modals at the same layer was not uniform,
which leads to the cross-modal interaction collapsing into a limited
multi-modal semantic information interaction. In this work, we propose the
UNIMO-3 model, which has the capacity to simultaneously learn the multimodal

effective connections between different layers in a cross-modal encoder, and
adaptively capture the interaction between two modalities at different levels.
The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art

The $k$-sum attacks are one of the major challenges to design secure

angle by defining a Public Third Party (PTP), which is an automatic process
that can be verifiable by the public and restricts the signing phase from
continuing until receiving commitments from all signers. Further, a two-round
multi-signature scheme MEMS with PTP is proposed, which is secure based on
discrete logarithm assumption in the random oracle model. As each signer
communicates directly with the PTP instead of other co-signers, the total
amount of communications is significantly reduced. In addition, as PTP
participates in the computation of the aggregation and signing algorithms, the
computation cost left for each signer and verifier remains the same as the
basis Schnorr signature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the maximum
efficiency that a Schnorr-based multi-signature scheme can achieve. Further,
MEMS is applied in blockchain platform, e.g., Fabric, to improve the

tool that can be used to optimize treatment design and increase the efficiency
of field operations. In most practical cases, hydraulic fractures propagate in
a multi-layered rock formation. As a result, there is a need to incorporate the
effect of such heterogeneities in fracturing models to achieve an accurate
prediction. To capture the layered structure of rocks, a hydraulic fracture
simulator typically requires a fine mesh, which leads to a drastic reduction in
computational performance. An alternative is to use more sophisticated models
that are capable of providing reasonably accurate predictions even on a
relatively coarse mesh. In the case of fracture growth modeling, the pivotal
component of the simulation is a fracture front tracking algorithm that
accounts for the layered structure of the formation. Consequently, this paper
aims to extend the established Implicit Level Set Algorithm (ILSA) to account
for the effect of multiple stress layers within the tip asymptote. The enhanced
front tracking algorithm involves the stress-corrected asymptote that
incorporates the influence of stress layers within the near-tip region. To
further increase the validity region of the stress-corrected asymptote, the
stress relaxation factor is introduced, and its accuracy is examined. The
numerical algorithm is validated against the reference semi-analytical
solutions as well as experimental observations. In addition, we investigate the
sensitivity of the fracture geometry to mesh size to demonstrate that the front
tracking algorithm based on the stress-corrected asymptote retains its accuracy
on a coarse mesh.

Such weakly-supervised settings have been gaining increasing attention since

first uses the label names as static features to generate pseudo labels, which
are then used for classifier training. While reasonable, such a commonly
adopted framework suffers from two limitations: (1) words can have different
meanings in different contexts, so using label names for context-free matching
can induce very noisy pseudo labels; and (2) the errors made in the pseudo
label generation stage will directly propagate to the classifier training stage
without a chance of being corrected. In this paper, we propose a new method,
PromptClass, consisting of two modules: (1) a pseudo label acquisition module
that uses zero-shot prompting of pre-trained language models (PLM) to get
pseudo labels based on contextualized text understanding, and (2) a
noise-robust self-training module that iteratively trains the classifier and
updates pseudo labels by utilizing two PLM fine-tuning strategies that
regularize each other. Extensive experiments show that PromptClass achieves
overall better performance than existing strong baselines on four benchmark

dominated by infrared dust emission, though broad emission lines are detected

actively accreting supermassive black hole hidden in its dusty cocoon,
resembling the observed properties of Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxies (Hot DOGs), a
population previously only identified at z>1.0. Using the broad component of
the MgII emission line, we estimate a black hole mass of $log \
(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 8.4 \pm 0.3$. The corresponding Eddington ratio of $1.4
\pm 0.2$ implies that the central black hole accretion is at the theoretical
limit of isotropic accretion. The rest-frame UV-optical SED and [O II] emission
line also indicate that the host galaxy of W1904+4853 harbors strong star
formation activity at the rate of up to $\sim 45 \ M_{\odot} \ yr^{-1}$. With
an estimated stellar mass of $3 \times 10^{10} \ M_{\odot}$, the host galaxy
appears to be a starburst system with respect to the main sequence of the
star-forming galaxies at the same redshift. Although blueshifted and asymmetric
[O III] emission provides evidence of an outflow, we estimate it to be an order
of magnitude smaller than the star formation rate, indicating that the current
obscured AGN activity at the center has not yet produced significant feedback
on the host galaxy star formation activity. W1904+4853 supports the
interpretation that Hot DOGs are a rare transitional phase of AGN accretion in

This work provides a new perspective. We observe that the features learned with

simply \textbf{pulling target features close to source features for each

overcome this limitation by using distant supervision, which utilizes results

we propose a distant supervision framework that leverages the relations between

  segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Privacy protection in medical data is a legitimate obstacle for centralized
machine learning applications. Here, we propose a client-server image
segmentation system which allows for the analysis of multi-centric medical
images while preserving patient privacy. In this approach, the client protects
the to-be-segmented patient image by mixing it to a reference image. As shown
in our work, it is challenging to separate the image mixture to exact original
content, thus making the data unworkable and unrecognizable for an unauthorized
person. This proxy image is sent to a server for processing. The server then
returns the mixture of segmentation maps, which the client can revert to a
correct target segmentation. Our system has two components: 1) a segmentation
network on the server side which processes the image mixture, and 2) a
segmentation unmixing network which recovers the correct segmentation map from
the segmentation mixture. Furthermore, the whole system is trained end-to-end.
The proposed method is validated on the task of MRI brain segmentation using
images from two different datasets. Results show that the segmentation accuracy
of our method is comparable to a system trained on raw images, and outperforms
other privacy-preserving methods with little computational overhead.

proposed method compares the received signals across the arrays to determine
whether a near, intermediate, or far-field channel estimation approach will be
appropriate. Subsequently, compressed estimation is performed in which the
proximity of multiple subarrays (SAs) at the transmitter and receiver is
exploited to reduce computational complexity and increase estimation accuracy.
Numerical results show that the proposed method can enhance channel estimation

metallicity gradient at early times for all four galaxies in our sample which
is caused by a sudden increase in the cold gas disk size (up to a factor of 2)
in combination with the supply of un-enriched gas ($\sim0.75$ dex lower
compared to the main galaxy) by the merging dwarf galaxies. The mergers mostly
affect the galaxy outskirts and lead to an increase in cold gas surface density
of up to 200% outside of $\sim8$ kpc. The addition of un-enriched gas breaks
the self-similar enrichment of the inter-stellar-medium and causes a dilution
of the cold gas in the outskirts of the galaxies. The accreted stars and the
ones formed later out of the accreted gas inhabit distinct tracks offset to
lower [$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] values compared to the main galaxy's stars. We
find that such mergers can contribute significantly to the formation of a

leverage the framework of so-called superset learning to construct set-valued
targets based on a confidence threshold, which deliver imprecise yet more

impacts many vision tasks. For example, in conditional image synthesis, spatial
conditions failing to adhere to the prior can result in visually inaccurate
synthetic results. This work aims to explicitly learn the visual prior and
enable the customization of sampling. Inspired by advances in language
modeling, we propose to learn Visual prior via Generative Pre-Training, dubbed
VisorGPT. By discretizing visual locations of objects, e.g., bounding boxes,
human pose, and instance masks, into sequences, VisorGPT can model visual prior
through likelihood maximization. Besides, prompt engineering is investigated to
unify various visual locations and enable customized sampling of sequential
outputs from the learned prior. Experimental results demonstrate that VisorGPT
can effectively model the visual prior, which can be employed for many vision
tasks, such as customizing accurate human pose for conditional image synthesis
models like ControlNet. Code will be released at

video length and action frequency, and the later network models all frames in a
flexible and dynamically expanding temporal receptive field to retrieve all

the first testable probe of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson discovered in
2012 ($h$) interacting with Higgs companion states, such as those existing in a
2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), chiefly, a CP-odd one ($A$). The production
mechanism of the latter at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) takes place via
$b\bar b$-annihilation and/or $gg$-fusion, depending on the 2HDM parameters, in
turn dictated by the Yukawa structure of this Beyond the SM (BSM) scenario.
Among the possible incarnations of the 2HDM, we test here the so-called
Type-II, for a twofold reason. On the one hand, it intriguingly offers two very
distinct parameter regions compliant with the SM-like Higgs measurements, i.e.,
where the so-called `SM limit' of the 2HDM can be achieved. On the other hand,
in both configurations, the $AZh$ coupling is generally small, hence the signal
is strongly polluted by backgrounds, so that the exploitation of Machine
Learning (ML) techniques becomes extremely useful. Ours approach in this
respect is a three-prong one. Firstly, we adjust ML models to analyze all
possible High Energy Physics (HEP) data types, so as to maximize the amount of
input information. Secondly, unlike most `black-box' ML approaches currently in
use in the HEP community, we exploit a (linear) Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA)
similarity metric to analyze the learned representations in the hidden layers,
thereby enabling an interpretative element of our results. Thirdly, we
emphasise that the proposed ML models are generic and can thus be adopted in
other physics problems. Concerning the one at hand, by using such advanced ML
implementations, we ultimately show that the sensitivity of LHC searches in the
$l^+l^- b\bar b$ ($l=e,\mu$) final state can significantly be improved with

between distance and energy consumption on 2.5D path planning is significantly
meaningful. In this paper, a deep reinforcement learning-based 2.5D
multi-objective path planning method (DMOP) is proposed. The DMOP can
efficiently find the desired path with three steps: (1) Transform the
high-resolution 2.5D map into a small-size map. (2) Use a trained deep Q

planned path to the original high-resolution map using a path enhanced method.
In addition, the imitation learning method and reward shaping theory are
applied to train the DQN. The reward function is constructed with the
information of terrain, distance, border. Simulation shows that the proposed
method can finish the multi-objective 2.5D path planning task. Also, simulation
proves that the method has powerful reasoning capability that enables it to
perform arbitrary untrained planning tasks on the same map.

model, $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills and $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills.
We compute the Nicolai map of the 2-dimensional Wess-Zumino model up to the
fifth order in the coupling. In $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills, we introduce
the notion of on- and off-shell Nicolai maps. The on-shell Nicolai map of
$\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills exists in d=3, 4, 6 and 10 dimensions but is
constrained to the Landau gauge. We compute this map up to the fourth order.
The off-shell Nicolai map exists only in d=4 dimensions but for general gauges.
We compute it in the axial gauge up to the second order. We show that the
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills Nicolai map can be obtained from the Nicolai
map of 10-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills by dimensional
reduction.
  Inverse Nicolai maps allow for a fermion (and ghost) free quantization of
supersymmetric (gauge) theories. We apply this property to compute the vacuum
expectation value of the infinite straight line Maldacena-Wilson loop in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills to the sixth order.
  In the second part of this thesis, we derive the explicit field content of
the 1/2-BPS stress tensor multiplet in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, which
contains the R-symmetry current and the energy-momentum tensor.

diversity objective called intra-list distance (ILD), defined as the average
pairwise distance between selected items, and a similar but lesser known
objective called dispersion, which is the minimum pairwise distance. Owing to
their simplicity and flexibility, ILD and dispersion have been used in a
plethora of diversified recommendation research. Nevertheless, we do not

  We present a critical reexamination of ILD and dispersion from theoretical

very close to each other, whereas dispersion may overlook distant item pairs.
As a competitor to ILD and dispersion, we design a diversity objective called
Gaussian ILD, which can interpolate between ILD and dispersion by tuning the
bandwidth parameter. We verify our theoretical results by experimental results

proposes a novel end-to-end online framework that improves performance and

module consisting of two linear layers. In view of preserving the intact
information learnt by the teacher network, during training, our FT module is
merely inserted after the last convolutional layer of the student network. The
first linear layer projects the student representation to a feature space
having N times feature channels than the teacher representation from the last
convolutional layer, and the second linear layer contracts the expanded output
back to the original feature space. By sequentially splitting the expanded
student representation into N non-overlapping feature segments having the same
number of feature channels as the teacher's, they can be readily forced to
approximate the intact teacher representation simultaneously, formulating a
novel many-to-one representation matching mechanism conditioned on a single

merged into the subsequent fully connected layer thanks to its linear property,

a new setting, continual offline reinforcement learning (CORL), where an agent
learns a sequence of offline reinforcement learning tasks and pursues good
performance on all learned tasks with a small replay buffer without exploring
any of the environments of all the sequential tasks. For consistently learning
on all sequential tasks, an agent requires acquiring new knowledge and
meanwhile preserving old knowledge in an offline manner. To this end, we
introduced continual learning algorithms and experimentally found experience
replay (ER) to be the most suitable algorithm for the CORL problem. However, we
observe that introducing ER into CORL encounters a new distribution shift
problem: the mismatch between the experiences in the replay buffer and
trajectories from the learned policy. To address such an issue, we propose a
new model-based experience selection (MBES) scheme to build the replay buffer,
where a transition model is learned to approximate the state distribution. This
model is used to bridge the distribution bias between the replay buffer and the
learned model by filtering the data from offline data that most closely
resembles the learned model for storage. Moreover, in order to enhance the
ability on learning new tasks, we retrofit the experience replay method with a
new dual behavior cloning (DBC) architecture to avoid the disturbance of
behavior-cloning loss on the Q-learning process. In general, we call our

shortest relative paths in the Document Object Model (DOM) tree which is a more

It also incorporates the popularity of each text node by counting the

the acute infection detection algorithm were 82.54 (95CI 72.86-91.60), 85.24

traditional models, but they encounter the long-time inference problem. To
tackle it, this paper proposes a Wavelet-Based Diffusion Model (WaveDM) with an
Efficient Conditional Sampling (ECS) strategy. WaveDM learns the distribution
of clean images in the wavelet domain conditioned on the wavelet spectrum of
degraded images after wavelet transform, which is more time-saving in each step
of sampling than modeling in the spatial domain. In addition, ECS follows the
same procedure as the deterministic implicit sampling in the initial sampling
period and then stops to predict clean images directly, which reduces the
number of total sampling steps to around 5. Evaluations on four benchmark
datasets including image raindrop removal, defocus deblurring, demoir\'eing,
and denoising demonstrate that WaveDM achieves state-of-the-art performance
with the efficiency that is comparable to traditional one-pass methods and over
100 times faster than existing image restoration methods using vanilla

simplicity and flexibility of data exploration. With the capabilities of recent
large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, this trade-off can be overcome.
  Results: We developed the chatbot ""GenSpectrum Chat""

inputs from real-world users, the chatbot provided a correct answer for 453
prompts; an incorrect answer for 13 prompts, and no answer although the
question was within scope for 34 prompts. We also tested the chatbot with

continual graph learning methods are proposed. However, existing continual

parameters contribute to learning different graph patterns. Based on the idea,
we expand model parameters to continually learn emerging graph patterns.

for the softer equation of state than that of the radiation fluid ($w=1/3$).
The angular momentum inside the collapsing region is estimated based on the
linear perturbation equation at the turn-around time which we define as the
time when the linear velocity perturbation in the conformal Newtonian gauge
takes the minimum value. The probability distribution is derived based on the
peak theory with the Gaussian curvature perturbation. We find that the root
mean square of the non-dimensional Kerr parameter $\sqrt{\langle
a_{*}^2\rangle}$ is approximately proportional to
$(M/M_{H})^{-1/3}(6w)^{-(1+2w)/(1+3w)}$, where $M$ and $M_{H}$ are the mass of
the PBH and the horizon mass at the horizon entry, respectively. Therefore the
typical value of the spin parameter decreases with the value of $w$. We also
evaluate the mass and spin distribution $P(a_{*}, M)$, taking account of the
critical phenomena. We find that, while the spin is mostly distributed in the
range of $10^{-3.9}\leq a_{*}\leq 10^{-1.8}$ for the radiation-dominated

the impact of a methodological improvement in measuring the magnification bias
signal on a sample of submillimeter galaxies and its implications for
constraining cosmological parameters. The analysis considers the angular
cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA galaxies
($0.2<z<0.8$) and a background sample of H-ATLAS submillimeter galaxies
($1.2<z<4.0$). A refined methodology, discussed extensively in Paper I, is
used. By interpreting the weak lensing signal within the halo model and
employing an MCMC algorithm, the posterior distribution of the halo occupation
distribution (HOD) and cosmological parameters is obtained for a flat
$\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis incorporates the foreground angular
auto-correlation function to account for galaxy clustering. The results
demonstrate a remarkable improvement in uncertainties for both HOD and
cosmological parameters compared to previous studies. However, when using the
cross-correlation data alone, the estimation of $\sigma_8$ depends on prior
knowledge of $\beta$, the logarithmic slope of the background number counts.
Assuming a physically motivated prior distribution for $\beta$, mean values of
$\Omega_m=0.18^{+0.03}{-0.03}$ and $\sigma_8=1.04^{+0.11}{-0.07}$ are obtained.
These results may however be subject to an inherent bias in the data due to
anomalous behavior observed in the G15 field. After excluding the G15 region,
the mean values shift to $\Omega_m=0.30^{+0.05}{-0.06}$ and
$\sigma_8=0.92^{+0.07}{-0.07}$. This becomes more apparent when adding the
clustering of the foreground sample, but the dependence on $\beta$ information
disappears, mitigating the aforementioned issue. Excluding the G15 region, the
joint analysis yields mean values of $\Omega_m=0.36^{+0.03}{-0.07}$,
$\sigma_8=0.90^{+0.03}{-0.03}$, and $h=0.76^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$.

scattering of cold dark matter particles on nuclei are generally small,
typically below the uncertainty in the local density of cold dark matter.
However, as shown in this paper, there are instances in which the electroweak
loop corrections are relatively large, and change significantly the
spin-independent dark matter scattering rate. An important example occurs when
the dark matter particle is a wino, e.g., in anomaly-mediated supersymmetry
breaking (AMSB) and pure gravity mediation (PGM) models. We find that the
one-loop electroweak corrections to the spin-independent wino LSP scattering
cross section generally interfere constructively with the tree-level
contribution for AMSB models with negative Higgsino mixing, $\mu < 0$, and in
PGM-like models for both signs of $\mu$, lifting the cross section out of the
neutrino fog and into a range that is potentially detectable in the next
generation of direct searches for cold dark matter scattering.

is difficult to interpret in human visual perception. Recently, SAR-to-optical
(S2O) image conversion methods have provided a prospective solution for
interpretation. However, since there is a huge domain difference between
optical and SAR images, they suffer from low image quality and geometric
distortion in the produced optical images. Motivated by the analogy between
pixels during the S2O image translation and molecules in a heat field,
Thermodynamics-inspired Network for SAR-to-Optical Image Translation (S2O-TDN)
is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a Third-order Finite
Difference (TFD) residual structure in light of the TFD equation of
thermodynamics, which allows us to efficiently extract inter-domain invariant
features and facilitate the learning of the nonlinear translation mapping. In
addition, we exploit the first law of thermodynamics (FLT) to devise an
FLT-guided branch that promotes the state transition of the feature values from
the unstable diffusion state to the stable one, aiming to regularize the
feature diffusion and preserve image structures during S2O image translation.
S2O-TDN follows an explicit design principle derived from thermodynamic theory
and enjoys the advantage of explainability. Experiments on the public SEN1-2
dataset show the advantages of the proposed S2O-TDN over the current methods
with more delicate textures and higher quantitative results.

synthesis of these patterns has been thoroughly studied in the literature,
their potential to control the mechanics of structured materials remains

-- a computational approach for automated design of physical surfaces
structured with stripe-shaped bi-material distributions. Our method builds on
the work by Knoppel and colleagues for generating globally-continuous and
equally-spaced stripe patterns. To unlock the full potential of this design
space, we propose a gradient-based optimization tool to automatically compute
stripe patterns that best approximate macromechanical performance goals.
Specifically, we propose a computational model that combines solid shell finite
elements with XFEM for accurate and fully-differentiable modeling of elastic
bi-material surfaces. To resolve non-uniqueness problems in the original
method, we furthermore propose a robust formulation that yields unique and
differentiable stripe patterns. %Finally, we introduce design space
regularizers to avoid numerical singularities and improve stripe neatness We
combine these components with equilibrium state derivatives into an end-to-end
differentiable pipeline that enables inverse design of mechanical stripe
patterns. We demonstrate our method on a diverse set of examples that
illustrate the potential of stripe patterns as a design space for structured
materials. Our simulation results are experimentally validated on physical

rare, especially in multi-treatment clinical trials, and the theoretical
properties of multi-treatment CAR have remained largely elusive for decades. In
this paper, we consider a general framework of CAR procedures for
multi-treatment clinal trials which can balance general covariate features,
such as quadratic and interaction terms which can be discrete, continuous, and
mixing. We show that under widely satisfied conditions the proposed procedures
have superior balancing properties; in particular, the convergence rate of
imbalance vectors can attain the best rate $O_P(1)$ for discrete covariates,
continuous covariates, or combinations of both discrete and continuous
covariates, and at the same time, the convergence rate of the imbalance of
unobserved covariates is $O_P(\sqrt n)$, where $n$ is the sample size. The
general framework unifies many existing methods and related theories,
introduces a much broader class of new and useful CAR procedures, and provides
new insights and a complete picture of the properties of CAR procedures. The
favorable balancing properties lead to the precision of the treatment effect
test in the presence of a heteroscedastic linear model with dependent covariate
features. As an application, the properties of the test of treatment effect
with unobserved covariates are studied under the CAR procedures, and consistent
tests are proposed so that the test has an asymptotic precise type I error even
if the working model is wrong and covariates are unobserved in the analysis.

we propose a GlObal Structure knowledgeguided relation Extraction (GOSE)

preliminary relation predictions on entity pairs. Secondly, it mines global
structure knowledge based on prediction results of the previous iteration and
further incorporates global structure knowledge into entity representations.

entity representations and global structure knowledge can mutually reinforce

likely to behave abnormally due to accidental failures or malicious attacks,
has recently become a hot research topic. However, even in the independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) case, existing BRDL methods will suffer from a
significant drop on model accuracy due to the large variance of stochastic
gradients. Increasing batch sizes is a simple yet effective way to reduce the
variance. However, when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, a
too-large batch size will lead to a too-small iteration number (update number),
which may also degrade the model accuracy. In view of this challenge, we mainly
study the optimal batch size when the total number of gradient computation is
fixed in this work. In particular, we theoretically and empirically show that
when the total number of gradient computation is fixed, the optimal batch size
in BRDL increases with the fraction of Byzantine workers. Therefore, compared
to the case without attacks, the batch size should be set larger when under
Byzantine attacks. However, for existing BRDL methods, large batch sizes will
lead to a drop on model accuracy, even if there is no Byzantine attack. To deal
with this problem, we propose a novel BRDL method, called Byzantine-robust
stochastic gradient descent with normalized momentum (ByzSGDnm), which can
alleviate the drop on model accuracy in large-batch cases. Moreover, we
theoretically prove the convergence of ByzSGDnm for general non-convex cases
under Byzantine attacks. Empirical results show that ByzSGDnm has a comparable
performance to existing BRDL methods under bit-flipping failure, but can
outperform existing BRDL methods under deliberately crafted attacks.

  Engines",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Auto-regressive search engines emerge as a promising paradigm for next-gen
information retrieval systems. These methods work with Seq2Seq models, where
each query can be directly mapped to the identifier of its relevant document.
As such, they are praised for merits like being end-to-end differentiable.
However, auto-regressive search engines also confront challenges in retrieval
quality, given the requirement for the exact generation of the document
identifier. That's to say, the targeted document will be missed from the
retrieval result if a false prediction about its identifier is made in any step
of the generation process. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely
AutoTSG (Auto-regressive Search Engine with Term-Set Generation), which is
featured by 1) the unordered term-based document identifier and 2) the
set-oriented generation pipeline. With AutoTSG, any permutation of the term-set
identifier will lead to the retrieval of the corresponding document, thus
largely relaxing the requirement of exact generation. Besides, the Seq2Seq
model is enabled to flexibly explore the optimal permutation of the document
identifier for the presented query, which may further contribute to the
retrieval quality. AutoTSG is empirically evaluated with Natural Questions and
MS MARCO, where notable improvements can be achieved against the existing
auto-regressive search engines.

since the knowledge is obtained from a few samples in the support set. To
address the problem, we propose a multi-information aggregation network
(MIANet) that effectively leverages the general knowledge, i.e., semantic word
embeddings, and instance information for accurate segmentation. Specifically,
in MIANet, a general information module (GIM) is proposed to extract a general
class prototype from word embeddings as a supplement to instance information.
To this end, we design a triplet loss that treats the general class prototype
as an anchor and samples positive-negative pairs from local features in the
support set. The calculated triplet loss can transfer semantic similarities
among language identities from a word embedding space to a visual
representation space. To alleviate the model biasing towards the seen training
classes and to obtain multi-scale information, we then introduce a
non-parametric hierarchical prior module (HPM) to generate unbiased
instance-level information via calculating the pixel-level similarity between
the support and query image features. Finally, an information fusion module
(IFM) combines the general and instance information to make predictions for the
query image. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that MIANet
yields superior performance and set a new state-of-the-art. Code is available

analysis, such descriptors are necessary for stochastic reconstructions,
stationarity and representativity analysis. The most important characteristic
of any such descriptor is its information content - or its ability to describe
the structure at hand. For example, from crystallography it is well known that
experimentally measurable $S_2$ correlation function lacks necessary
information content to describe majority of structures. The information content
of this function can be assessed using Monte-Carlo methods only for very small
2D images due to computational expenses. Some indirect quantitative approaches
for this and other correlation function were also proposed. Yet, to date no
methodology to obtain information content for arbitrary 2D or 3D image is
available. In this work, we make a step toward developing a general framework
to perform such computations analytically. We show, that one can assess the
entropy of a perturbed random field and that stochastic perturbation of fields
correlation function decreases its information content. In addition to
analytical expression, we demonstrate that different regions of correlation
function are in different extent informative and sensitive for perturbation.

society has serious concerns about how adversaries can exploit such models to
generate unsafe images. In this work, we focus on demystifying the generation
of unsafe images and hateful memes from Text-to-Image models. We first
construct a typology of unsafe images consisting of five categories (sexually
explicit, violent, disturbing, hateful, and political). Then, we assess the
proportion of unsafe images generated by four advanced Text-to-Image models
using four prompt datasets. We find that these models can generate a
substantial percentage of unsafe images; across four models and four prompt
datasets, 14.56% of all generated images are unsafe. When comparing the four
models, we find different risk levels, with Stable Diffusion being the most
prone to generating unsafe content (18.92% of all generated images are unsafe).
Given Stable Diffusion's tendency to generate more unsafe content, we evaluate
its potential to generate hateful meme variants if exploited by an adversary to
attack a specific individual or community. We employ three image editing
methods, DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, and SDEdit, which are supported by
Stable Diffusion. Our evaluation result shows that 24% of the generated images
using DreamBooth are hateful meme variants that present the features of the
original hateful meme and the target individual/community; these generated
images are comparable to hateful meme variants collected from the real world.
Overall, our results demonstrate that the danger of large-scale generation of
unsafe images is imminent. We discuss several mitigating measures, such as
curating training data, regulating prompts, and implementing safety filters,
and encourage better safeguard tools to be developed to prevent unsafe
generation.

enables participants to collaborate and train a shared model without sharing

FL. While FL promotes privacy by minimizing the amount of user data stored on
central servers, it still poses privacy risks that need to be addressed.
Industry standards such as differential privacy, secure multi-party
computation, homomorphic encryption, and secure aggregation protocols are
followed to ensure privacy in FL. Fairness is also a critical issue in FL, as
models can inherit biases present in local datasets, leading to unfair
predictions. Balancing privacy and fairness in FL is a challenge, as privacy
requires protecting user data while fairness requires representative training
data. This paper presents a ""Fair Differentially Private Federated Learning
Framework"" that addresses the challenges of generating a fair global model
without validation data and creating a globally private differential model. The
framework employs clipping techniques for biased model updates and Gaussian
mechanisms for differential privacy. The paper also reviews related works on
privacy and fairness in FL, highlighting recent advancements and approaches to
mitigate bias and ensure privacy. Achieving privacy and fairness in FL requires
careful consideration of specific contexts and requirements, taking into

  process regression and statistical finite element analysis",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.comp-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The efficient representation of random fields on geometrically complex
domains is crucial for Bayesian modelling in engineering and machine learning.
Today's prevalent random field representations are restricted to unbounded
domains or are too restrictive in terms of possible field properties. As a
result, new techniques leveraging the historically established link between
stochastic PDEs (SPDEs) and random fields are especially appealing for
engineering applications with complex geometries which already have a finite
element discretisation for solving the physical conservation equations. Unlike
the dense covariance matrix of a random field, its inverse, the precision
matrix, is usually sparse and equal to the stiffness matrix of a Helmholtz-like
SPDE. In this paper, we use the SPDE representation to develop a scalable
framework for large-scale statistical finite element analysis (statFEM) and
Gaussian process (GP) regression on geometrically complex domains. We use the
SPDE formulation to obtain the relevant prior probability densities with a
sparse precision matrix. The properties of the priors are governed by the
parameters and possibly fractional order of the Helmholtz-like SPDE so that we
can model on bounded domains and manifolds anisotropic, non-homogeneous random
fields with arbitrary smoothness. We use for assembling the sparse precision
matrix the same finite element mesh used for solving the physical conservation
equations. The observation models for statFEM and GP regression are such that
the posterior probability densities are Gaussians with a closed-form mean and
precision. The expressions for the mean vector and the precision matrix can be
evaluated using only sparse matrix operations. We demonstrate the versatility
of the proposed framework and its convergence properties with one and
two-dimensional Poisson and thin-shell examples.

approximate Bayesian posterior distributions in statistical learning procedures

algorithms, SGLD is not stationary with respect to the posterior distribution;
two sources of error appear: The first error is introduced by an
Euler--Maruyama discretisation of a Langevin diffusion process, the second
error comes from the data subsampling that enables its use in large-scale data
settings. In this work, we consider an idealised version of SGLD to analyse the
method's pure subsampling error that we then see as a best-case error for
diffusion-based subsampling MCMC methods. Indeed, we introduce and study the
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Diffusion (SGLDiff), a continuous-time Markov
process that follows the Langevin diffusion corresponding to a data subset and
switches this data subset after exponential waiting times. There, we show that
the Wasserstein distance between the posterior and the limiting distribution of
SGLDiff is bounded above by a fractional power of the mean waiting time.
Importantly, this fractional power does not depend on the dimension of the
state space. We bring our results into context with other analyses of SGLD.

assess their compliance with the law. Research has nevertheless shown that
platforms can manipulate their API answers through fairwashing. Facing this
threat for reliable auditing, this paper studies the benefits of the joint use
of platform scraping and of APIs. In this setup, we elaborate on the use of
scraping to detect manipulated answers: since fairwashing only manipulates API
answers, exploiting scraps may reveal a manipulation. To abstract the wide
range of specific API-scrap situations, we introduce a notion of proxy that
captures the consistency an auditor might expect between both data sources. If
the regulator has a good proxy of the consistency, then she can easily detect
manipulation and even bypass the API to conduct her audit. On the other hand,
without a good proxy, relying on the API is necessary, and the auditor cannot
defend against fairwashing.
  We then simulate practical scenarios in which the auditor may mostly rely on
the API to conveniently conduct the audit task, while maintaining her chances
to detect a potential manipulation. To highlight the tension between the audit
task and the API fairwashing detection task, we identify Pareto-optimal
strategies in a practical audit scenario.
  We believe this research sets the stage for reliable audits in practical and
manipulation-prone setups.

However, identifying such commits is highly challenging, as only a very small

  To address these challenges and boost the effectiveness of prior works, we

change granularity, corresponding to commit-level, file-level, hunk-level, and

effective way to adapt a network to a new target domain by utilizing a
pretrained ATR network in the source domain. We propose an unpaired
transductive transfer learning framework where a CycleGAN model and a
well-trained ATR classifier in the source domain are used to construct an ATR
classifier in the target domain without having any labeled data in the target
domain. We employ a CycleGAN model to transfer the mid-wave infrared (MWIR)
images to visible (VIS) domain images (or visible to MWIR domain). To train the
transductive CycleGAN, we optimize a cost function consisting of the
adversarial, identity, cycle-consistency, and categorical cross-entropy loss
for both the source and target classifiers. In this paper, we perform a
detailed experimental analysis on the challenging DSIAC ATR dataset. The
dataset consists of ten classes of vehicles at different poses and distances
ranging from 1-5 kilometers on both the MWIR and VIS domains. In our
experiment, we assume that the images in the VIS domain are the unlabeled

then project them into a common distance of 2 kilometers. Our proposed

edges are the functional dependencies.
  Such a graph actually represents the datasets of an application and their

define a database over a context $\mathcal C$ to be a function $\delta$ that
associates each node $X$ of $\mathcal C$ with a finite set of values
$\delta(X)$ from the domain of $X$ and each edge $e: X \to Y$ with a total
function $\delta(e): \delta(X) \to \delta(Y)$. We combine the nodes and edges
of a context using a functional algebra in order to define queries; and the set
of all well-formed expressions of this algebra is the query language of the
context. A relation over attributes $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ is then defined as a
query whose paths form a tree with leaves $A_1, \ldots, A_n$ and whose root is
the key.

response variables. For each case, our theory shows that the proposed estimator
has a minmax near-optimal convergence rate. We then further investigate
low-rank linear models with heavy-tailed matrix-type responses. The theory
shows that when the random noise has only $(2+\epsilon)$-order moment, our
robust estimator still has almost the same statistical convergence rate as that
of sub-Gaussian data. Moreover, our simulation experiments confirm the
correctness of theories and show the superiority of our estimators.

polarization from the Calar Alto, and Perkins Telescope observatories. Our
contemporaneous X-ray data suggest that the {\it IXPE} energy band is at the
crossover between the low- and high-frequency blazar emission humps. The source
displays significant variability during the observation, and we measure
polarization in three separate time bins. Contemporaneous X-ray spectra allow
us to determine the relative contribution from each emission hump. We find
$>99\%$ confidence X-ray polarization $\Pi_{2-4{\rm keV}} =

video is based on a head-mounted display (HMD), where participants' fixations
are collected while wearing an HMD to explore the given panoptic scene freely.
However, this widely-used data collection method is insufficient for training
deep models to accurately predict which regions in a given panoptic are most
important when it contains intermittent salient events. The main reason is that
there always exist ""blind zooms"" when using HMD to collect fixations since the
participants cannot keep spinning their heads to explore the entire panoptic
scene all the time. Consequently, the collected fixations tend to be trapped in
some local views, leaving the remaining areas to be the ""blind zooms"".
Therefore, fixation data collected using HMD-based methods that accumulate
local views cannot accurately represent the overall global importance of
complex panoramic scenes. This paper introduces the auxiliary Window with a
Dynamic Blurring (WinDB) fixation collection approach for panoptic video, which
doesn't need HMD and is blind-zoom-free. Thus, the collected fixations can well
reflect the regional-wise importance degree. Using our WinDB approach, we have
released a new PanopticVideo-300 dataset, containing 300 panoptic clips

oscillators. While it is often a goal to achieve, in some context one would
like to decrease it, e.g., although synchronization is essential to the good

control schemes able to decrease synchronization in a system. Focusing on one
of these methods, the goal of the present work is to analyse which is the best

nodes to control, especially when the degree distribution is heterogeneous.
Nevertheless, pinning a too large number of hubs is in general not an

in this work, we find the method above is not ideal for the SNNs training as it
omits the temporal dynamics of SNNs and degrades the performance quickly with
the decrease of inference time steps. One tempting method to model temporal
correlations is to apply the same label supervision at each time step and treat
them identically. Although it can acquire relatively consistent performance
across various time steps, it still faces challenges in obtaining SNNs with
high performance. Inspired by these observations, we propose Temporal-domain

with low latency and high performance by incorporating contrastive supervision
with temporal domain information. Contrastive learning (CL) prompts the network
to discern both consistency and variability in the representation space,
enabling it to better learn discriminative and generalizable features. We
extend this concept to the temporal domain of SNNs, allowing us to flexibly and
fully leverage the correlation between representations at different time steps.
Furthermore, we propose a Siamese Temporal-domain supervised Contrastive

that SNNs trained by our TCL and STCL can achieve both high performance and low

convective regions do not grow indefinitely due to entrainment of fresh

organized into 'avalanches' of synchronized spikes which propagate to target

boosts signal transfer by a simple disinhibition of a control population,
without requiring changes in synaptic weights. Our framework is fully

achieve uninterrupted radio-jamming and tracking of the malicious target, in
the presence of jamming interference constraints. The proposed approach is
formulated as a distributed model predictive control (MPC) problem and is

achieve near-optimal performance in traditional massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems.
It is critical to note that in large-scale antenna arrays the operation of
channel matrix inversion poses a significant computational challenge for these

precoding matrix for XL-MIMO systems instead of direct matrix inversion. Taking
into account small- and large-scale fading as well as spatial correlation
between antennas, we study their computational complexity and convergence rate.
Furthermore, we propose the Jacobi-Preconditioning Conjugate Gradient (Jac-PCG)
iterative inversion method, which enjoys a faster convergence speed than the CG

class for a given classification task on a dataset. Traditionally, model
selection is based on cross-validation, meta-learning, and user preferences,
which are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. The performance of any
machine learning classification task depends on the choice of the model class,
the learning algorithm, and the dataset's characteristics. Our work proposes a
novel method for automatic classification model selection from a set of
candidate model classes by determining the empirical model-fitness for a
dataset based only on its clustering indices. Clustering Indices measure the
ability of a clustering algorithm to induce good quality neighborhoods with
similar data characteristics. We propose a regression task for a given model
class, where the clustering indices of a given dataset form the features and
the dependent variable represents the expected classification performance. We
compute the dataset clustering indices and directly predict the expected
classification performance using the learned regressor for each candidate model
class to recommend a suitable model class for dataset classification. We
evaluate our model selection method through cross-validation with 60 publicly
available binary class datasets and show that our top3 model recommendation is
accurate for over 45 of 60 datasets. We also propose an end-to-end Automated ML
system for data classification based on our model selection method. We evaluate
our end-to-end system against popular commercial and noncommercial Automated ML

Galaxy, M 51, is still debated. Current estimates range from 6.02 to 9.09 Mpc,

published for M 51 to date. We aim to estimate a more reliable distance to M 51
through two independent methods: Cepheid variables and their period-luminosity
relation, and an augmented version of the expanding photosphere method (EPM) on
the Type IIP SN 2005cs. For the Cepheid variables, we analyse a recently
published HST catalogue of stars in M 51. By applying light curve and
colour-magnitude diagram-based filtering, we select a high-quality sample of M
51 Cepheids to estimate the distance through the period-luminosity relation.
For SN 2005cs, an emulator-based spectral fitting technique is applied, which
allows for the fast and reliable estimation of physical parameters of the
supernova atmosphere. We augment the established framework of EPM with these
spectral models to obtain a precise distance to M 51. The two resulting
distance estimates are D_Cep = 7.59 +/- 0.30 Mpc and D_2005cs = 7.34 +/- 0.39
Mpc using the Cepheid period-luminosity relation and the spectral modelling of
SN 2005cs respectively. This is the first published Cepheid distance for this
galaxy. Given that these two estimates are completely independent, one may
combine them, which yields D_M51 = 7.50 +/- 0.24 Mpc (3.2% uncertainty). Our
distance estimates are in agreement with most of the results obtained
previously for M 51, while being more precise than the earlier counterparts.
They are however significantly lower than the TRGB estimates, which are often
adopted for the distance to this galaxy. The results highlight the importance
of direct cross-checks between independent distance estimates for quantifying
systematic uncertainties.

the received tensor signal in a multi-domain massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) system, as the receiver generally sums the components
from different paths or users. To achieve accurate and low-latency channel
estimation, good and fast CP decomposition algorithms are desired. The CP
alternating least squares (CPALS) is the workhorse algorithm for calculating
the CP decomposition. However, its performance depends on the initializations,
and good starting values can lead to more efficient solutions. Existing
initialization strategies are decoupled from the CPALS and are not necessarily
favorable for solving the CP decomposition. To enhance the algorithm's speed
and accuracy, this paper proposes a deep-learning-aided CPALS (DL-CPALS) method
that uses a deep neural network (DNN) to generate favorable initializations.
The proposed DL-CPALS integrates the DNN and CPALS to a model-based deep
learning paradigm, where it trains the DNN to generate an initialization that
facilitates fast and accurate CP decomposition. Moreover, benefiting from the
CP low-rankness, the proposed method is trained using noisy data and does not
require paired clean data. The proposed DL-CPALS is applied to millimeter wave
MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (mmWave MIMO-OFDM) channel
estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements of

times the protosolar value (2$\sigma$ uncertainties). Even if the nominal value
is supersolar, subsolar abundances cannot be ruled out. Here we use a
state-of-the-art one-dimensional thermochemical and diffusion model with
updated chemistry to constrain the deep oxygen abundance with upper
tropospheric CO observations. We find a value of 0.3$_{-0.2}^{+0.5}$ times the
protosolar value. This result suggests that Jupiter could have a carbon-rich
envelope that accreted in a region where the protosolar nebula was depleted in
water. However, our model can also reproduce a solar/supersolar water abundance
if vertical mixing is reduced in a radiative layer where the deep oxygen
abundance is obtained. More precise measurements of the deep water abundance
are needed to discriminate between these two scenarios and understand Jupiter's
internal structure and evolution.

is exploited to transfer knowledge with rich semantic priors from the

distinct paths is necessary for optimization-based trajectory planners where
found trajectories are restricted to only a single homotopy class of a given
path. Distinct paths can also be used to guide sampling-based motion planning
and thus increase the effectiveness of planning in environments with narrow
passages. Graph-based representation called roadmap is a common representation
for path planning and also for finding multiple distinct paths. However,
challenging environments with multiple narrow passages require a densely
sampled roadmap to capture the connectivity of the environment. Searching such
a dense roadmap for multiple paths is computationally too expensive. Therefore,
the majority of existing methods construct only a sparse roadmap which,
however, struggles to find all distinct paths in challenging environments. To
this end, we propose the CTopPRM which creates a sparse graph by clustering an
initially sampled dense roadmap. Such a reduced roadmap allows fast
identification of homotopically distinct paths captured in the dense roadmap.
We show, that compared to the existing methods the CTopPRM improves the

exploits the internal bandwidth of DRAM using the bank-, bank group-, chip-,
and rank-level parallelisms. Considering the properties of data analytics
operators and DRAM's area constraints, Darwin maximizes the internal data
bandwidth by placing the PIM processing units, buffers, and control circuits
across the hierarchy of DRAM. More specifically, it introduces the bank
processing unit for each bank in which a single instruction multiple data
(SIMD) unit handles regular data analytics operators and bank group processing
unit for each bank group to handle workload imbalance in the condition-oriented
data analytics operators. Furthermore, Darwin supports a novel PIM instruction
architecture that concatenates instructions for multiple thread executions on
bank group processing entities, addressing the command bottleneck by enabling
separate control of up to 512 different in-memory processing units
simultaneously. We build a cycle-accurate simulation framework to evaluate
Darwin with various DRAM configurations, optimization schemes and workloads.
Darwin achieves up to 14.7x speedup over the non-optimized version. Finally,
the proposed Darwin architecture achieves 4.0x-43.9x higher throughput and
reduces energy consumption by 85.7% than the baseline CPU system (Intel Xeon
Gold 6226 + 4 channels of DDR4-2933). Compared to the state-of-the-art PIM,
Darwin achieves up to 7.5x and 7.1x in the basic query operators and TPC-H

However,
they still struggle when it comes to reliably generating complex output
structures, such as those required for information extraction. This limitation
stems from the fact that LLMs, without fine-tuning, tend to generate free text
rather than structures precisely following a specific grammar. In this work, we
propose to enrich the decoding with formal grammar constraints. More
concretely, given Context-Free Grammar(CFG), our framework ensures that the
token generated in each decoding step would lead to a valid continuation
compliant with the grammar production rules. This process guarantees the
generation of valid sequences. Importantly, our framework can be readily
combined with any CFG or decoding algorithm. We demonstrate that the outputs of
many NLP tasks can be represented as formal languages, making them suitable for
direct use in our framework. We conducted experiments with two challenging
tasks involving large alphabets in their grammar (Wikidata entities and
relations): information extraction and entity disambiguation. Our results with
LLaMA models indicate that grammar-constrained decoding substantially
outperforms unconstrained decoding and even competes with task-specific
fine-tuned models. These findings suggest that integrating grammar-based
constraints during decoding holds great promise in making LLMs reliably produce
structured outputs, especially in setting where training data is scarce and
fine-tuning is expensive.

site of interest, a set of 1D velocity and density models are created using
prior knowledge of the local geology; pairs of seismic shot gathers and
Rayleigh-wave phase dispersion curves are then numerically modeled and used to
train a simplified residual network. The proposed approach is shown to achieve
high quality predictions of dispersion curves on a synthetic test dataset and
is, ultimately, successfully deployed on a field dataset. Various uncertainty

the quality of the inference process and better understand the underlying

research efforts in developing bias mitigation techniques. However, most works
focus on debiasing of bilingual models without consideration for multilingual
systems. In this paper, we specifically target the unambiguous gender bias
issue of multilingual machine translation models and propose a new mitigation
method based on a novel perspective on the problem. We hypothesize that the
gender bias in unambiguous settings is due to the lack of gender information
encoded into the non-explicit gender words and devise a scheme to encode
correct gender information into their latent embeddings. Specifically, we
employ Gender-Aware Contrastive Learning, GACL, based on gender pseudo-labels
to encode gender information on the encoder embeddings. Our method is
target-language-agnostic and applicable to already trained multilingual machine
translation models through post-fine-tuning. Through multilingual evaluation,
we show that our approach improves gender accuracy by a wide margin without
hampering translation performance. We also observe that incorporated gender
information transfers and benefits other target languages regarding gender
accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is applicable and beneficial
to models of various sizes.

an untrimmed video with natural language queries. Existing VMR methods suffer
from two defects: (1) massive expensive temporal annotations are required to
obtain satisfying performance; (2) complicated cross-modal interaction modules
are deployed, which lead to high computational cost and low efficiency for the
retrieval process. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed
Cheaper and Faster Moment Retrieval (CFMR), which well balances the retrieval
accuracy, efficiency, and annotation cost for VMR. Specifically, our proposed
CFMR method learns from point-level supervision where each annotation is a
single frame randomly located within the target moment. It is 6 times cheaper
than the conventional annotations of event boundaries. Furthermore, we also
design a concept-based multimodal alignment mechanism to bypass the usage of
cross-modal interaction modules during the inference process, remarkably
improving retrieval efficiency. The experimental results on three widely used
VMR benchmarks demonstrate the proposed CFMR method establishes new
state-of-the-art with point-level supervision. Moreover, it significantly
accelerates the retrieval speed with more than 100 times FLOPs compared to
existing approaches with point-level supervision.

ultra-local (in time) internal state-space representation (a finite chain of
integrators) of the fault vector. Next, a nonlinear state observer is designed
based on the known parts of the augmented dynamics. This nonlinear filter
(observer) reconstructs the fault signal as well as the states of the augmented
system. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantee stability of the
estimation error dynamics: firstly, asymptotic stability (i.e., perfect fault
estimation) in the absence of perturbations induced by fault model mismatch
(mismatch between internal, ultralocal model for the fault and the actual fault
characteristics), uncertainty, external disturbances, and measurement noise
and, secondly, Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the estimation error dynamics

performance-based estimator design, we provide Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)
conditions for L2-gain and L2 - L_inf induced norm and cast the synthesis of
the estimator gains as a semi-definite program where the effect of model
mismatch and external disturbances on the fault estimation error is minimized
in the sense of L2-gain, for an acceptable L2 - L_inf induced norm with respect

addresses the performance trade-off between noise sensitivity and robustness
against model mismatch and external disturbances. Finally, numerical results

  In a sports game between two teams, the chance the home team wins is
initially $x_0 \in (0,1)$ and finally 0 or 1. As an idealization we take a
continuous time interval $[0,1]$ and consider the process $M=(M_t)_{t\in
[0,1]}$ giving the probability at time $t$ that the home team wins. This is a
martingale which we idealize further to have continuous paths. We consider the
problem to find the most random martingale $M$ of this type, where `most
random' is interpreted as a maximal entropy criterion. We observe that this
max-entropy win-martingale $M$ also minimizes specific relative entropy with
respect to Brownian motion in the sense of Gantert and use this to prove that
$M$ is characterized by the stochastic differential equation $$ dM_t =
\frac{\sin (\pi M_t )} {\pi\sqrt {1-t}}\, dB_t.$$ To derive the form of the

  localization in a LiDAR semantic pole-map",,,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In most urban and suburban areas, pole-like structures such as tree trunks or
utility poles are ubiquitous. These structural landmarks are very useful for
the localization of autonomous vehicles given their geometrical locations in
maps and measurements from sensors. In this work, we aim at creating an
accurate map for autonomous vehicles or robots with pole-like structures as the
dominant localization landmarks, hence called pole-map. In contrast to the
previous pole-based mapping or localization methods, we exploit the semantics
of pole-like structures. Specifically, semantic segmentation is achieved by a
new mask-range transformer network in a mask-classfication paradigm. With the
semantics extracted for the pole-like structures in each frame, a multi-layer
semantic pole-map is created by aggregating the detected pole-like structures
from all frames. Given the semantic pole-map, we propose a semantic
particle-filtering localization scheme for vehicle localization. Theoretically,
we have analyzed why the semantic information can benefit the particle-filter
localization, and empirically it is validated on the public SemanticKITTI
dataset that the particle-filtering localization with semantics achieves much
better performance than the counterpart without semantics when each particle's
odometry prediction and/or the online observation is subject to uncertainties
at significant levels.

estimation approaches commonly used in criminology. We assessed the impact of
houselessness at probation start on rearrest within one year among a cohort of
people on probation (n = 2,453). We estimated IPS effects, considering general
and crime-specific recidivism if subjects were more or less likely to be
unhoused and assessed effect variation by psychiatric disorder status. We used
a doubly robust machine learning estimator to flexibly but efficiently estimate
effects. Decreasing houselessness led to a lower estimated average rate of
recidivism. Dividing the odds of houselessness by ten had a significant effect
when compared to multiplying the odds of houselessness by ten, corresponding to
a 9% reduction in the estimated average rate of recidivism (p < 0.05). Milder
interventions showed smaller, non-significant effect sizes. Stratifying by
diagnoses and re-arrest type led to similar results without statistical
significance. Minding limitations related to observational data and
generalizability, this study supports houselessness as a risk factor for
recidivism across populations with a new analytic approach. Efforts to reduce
recidivism should include interventions that make houselessness less likely,
such as increasing housing access. Meanwhile, efforts to establish recidivism
risk factors should consider alternative effects like IPS effects to maximize
validity and reduce bias.

analysis. One notable cohesive structure is $\gamma$-quasi-clique (QC), where
each vertex connects at least a fraction $\gamma$ of the other vertices inside.
Enumerating maximal $\gamma$-quasi-cliques (MQCs) of a graph has been widely
studied. One common practice of finding all MQCs is to (1) find a set of QCs
containing all MQCs and then (2) filter out non-maximal QCs. While quite a few
algorithms have been developed (which are branch-and-bound algorithms) for
finding a set of QCs that contains all MQCs, all focus on sharpening the
pruning techniques and devote little effort to improving the branching part. As
a result, they provide no guarantee on pruning branches and all have the
worst-case time complexity of $O^*(2^n)$, where $O^*$ suppresses the
polynomials and $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of finding a set of QCs containing all MQCs but deviate
from further sharpening the pruning techniques as existing methods do. We pay
attention to both the pruning and branching parts and develop new pruning
techniques and branching methods that would suit each other better towards
pruning more branches both theoretically and practically. Specifically, we
develop a new branch-and-bound algorithm called FastQC based on newly developed
pruning techniques and branching methods, which improves the worst-case time
complexity to $O^*(\alpha_k^n)$, where $\alpha_k$ is a positive real number
strictly smaller than 2. Furthermore, we develop a divide-and-conquer strategy
for boosting the performance of FastQC. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on both real and synthetic datasets, and the results show that our
algorithms are up to two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art
on real datasets.

immensely useful for a variety of downstream tasks. However, their utility is
limited by their entanglement with respect to different visual attributes. For
instance, recent work has shown that CLIP image representations are often
biased toward specific visual properties (such as objects or actions) in an
unpredictable manner. In this paper, we propose to separate representations of
the different visual modalities in CLIP's joint vision-language space by
leveraging the association between parts of speech and specific visual modes of
variation (e.g. nouns relate to objects, adjectives describe appearance). This
is achieved by formulating an appropriate component analysis model that learns
subspaces capturing variability corresponding to a specific part of speech,
while jointly minimising variability to the rest. Such a subspace yields
disentangled representations of the different visual properties of an image or
text in closed form while respecting the underlying geometry of the manifold on
which the representations lie. What's more, we show the proposed model
additionally facilitates learning subspaces corresponding to specific visual
appearances (e.g. artists' painting styles), which enables the selective
removal of entire visual themes from CLIP-based text-to-image synthesis. We
validate the model both qualitatively, by visualising the subspace projections
with a text-to-image model and by preventing the imitation of artists' styles,
and quantitatively, through class invariance metrics and improvements to

problems (CSP). Traditional CG method, which repeatedly solves a restricted
master problem (RMP), often suffers from two critical issues in practice -- the
loss of solution quality introduced by linear relaxation of both feasible
domain and objective and the high time cost of last iterations close to
convergence. We empirically find that the first issue is common in ordinary
CSPs with linear cutting constraints, while the second issue is especially
severe in CSPs with nonlinear cutting constraints that are often generated by
approximating chance constraints. We propose an alternative approach, ensembles
of multiple column generation processes. In particular, we present two methods
-- \mc (multi-column) which return multiple feasible columns in each RMP
iteration, and \mt (multi-path) which restarts the RMP iterations from
different initialized column sets once the iteration time exceeds a given time
limit. The ideas behind are same: leverage the multiple column generation
pathes to compensate the loss induced by relaxation, and add earlier
sub-optimal columns to accelerate convergence of RMP iterations. Besides, we
give theoretical analysis on performance improvement guarantees. Experiments on
cutting stock problems demonstrate that compared to traditional CG, our method
achieves significant run-time reduction on CSPs with nonlinear constraints, and
dramatically improves the ratio of solve-to-optimal on CSPs with linear
constraints.

concepts emerges as scaling up LMs, but there are still basic concepts to which
the scaling law does not apply. For example, OPT-175B performs close to humans
with a zero-shot accuracy of 85\% on the material concept, yet behaves like
random guessing on the mass concept. Instead, vision-augmented LMs such as CLIP
and BLIP achieve a human-level understanding of embodied concepts. Analysis
indicates that the rich semantics in visual representation can serve as a
valuable source of embodied knowledge. Inspired by this, we propose a
distillation method to transfer embodied knowledge from VLMs to LMs, achieving
performance gain comparable with that by scaling up the parameters of LMs 134x.

scene-agnostic feature backbone, and a scene-specific prediction head. Less
obvious: using an MLP prediction head allows us to optimize across thousands of
view points simultaneously in each single training iteration. This leads to
stable and extremely fast convergence. Furthermore, we substitute effective but
slow end-to-end training using a robust pose solver with a curriculum over a

jets. However, this division is not sharp and observations of these sources at
large scales often show intermediate jet morphologies or even hybrid jet
morphologies with a FRI type jet on one side and a FRII type jet on the other.
A good example of a radio galaxy that is difficult to classify as FRI or FRII
is Hercules~A. This source shows jets with bright radio lobes (a common feature
of FRII type jets) albeit without the hotspots indicative of the violent
interaction between the jet and the ambient medium at the impact region,
because the jets seem to be disrupted inside the lobes at a distance from the
bow shocks surrounding the lobes. In this paper, we explore the jet physics
that could trigger this peculiar morphology by means of three-dimensional
relativisitic hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that the large-scale
morphological features of Hercules A jets and lobes can be reproduced by the
propagation of a relativistically hot plasma outflow that is disrupted by
helical instability modes, and generates a hot lobe that expands isotropically

  Gradient Descent","59 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.ST cs.LG math.PR stat.CO stat.ML stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a nonparametric particle-based
deterministic sampling algorithm. Despite its wide usage, understanding the
theoretical properties of SVGD has remained a challenging problem. For sampling
from a Gaussian target, the SVGD dynamics with a bilinear kernel will remain
Gaussian as long as the initializer is Gaussian. Inspired by this fact, we
undertake a detailed theoretical study of the Gaussian-SVGD, i.e., SVGD
projected to the family of Gaussian distributions via the bilinear kernel, or
equivalently Gaussian variational inference (GVI) with SVGD. We present a
complete picture by considering both the mean-field PDE and discrete particle
systems. When the target is strongly log-concave, the mean-field Gaussian-SVGD
dynamics is proven to converge linearly to the Gaussian distribution closest to
the target in KL divergence. In the finite-particle setting, there is both
uniform in time convergence to the mean-field limit and linear convergence in
time to the equilibrium if the target is Gaussian. In the general case, we
propose a density-based and a particle-based implementation of the
Gaussian-SVGD, and show that several recent algorithms for GVI, proposed from
different perspectives, emerge as special cases of our unified framework.
Interestingly, one of the new particle-based instance from this framework
empirically outperforms existing approaches. Our results make concrete
contributions towards obtaining a deeper understanding of both SVGD and GVI.

interpolate noisy training data. While benign overfitting in fixed dimension
has been established for some learning methods, current literature suggests
that for regression with typical kernel methods and wide neural networks,
benign overfitting requires a high-dimensional setting where the dimension
grows with the sample size. In this paper, we show that the smoothness of the
estimators, and not the dimension, is the key: benign overfitting is possible
if and only if the estimator's derivatives are large enough. We generalize
existing inconsistency results to non-interpolating models and more kernels to
show that benign overfitting with moderate derivatives is impossible in fixed
dimension. Conversely, we show that benign overfitting is possible for
regression with a sequence of spiky-smooth kernels with large derivatives.
Using neural tangent kernels, we translate our results to wide neural networks.
We prove that while infinite-width networks do not overfit benignly with the
ReLU activation, this can be fixed by adding small high-frequency fluctuations
to the activation function. Our experiments verify that such neural networks,
while overfitting, can indeed generalize well even on low-dimensional data

help resolve language ambiguity and generate possible solutions to abstract
specifications. While LLMs have shown promise as few-shot planning policies,
their potential for planning complex tasks is not fully tapped. This paper
shows that LLMs can be used as both the commonsense model of the world and the
heuristic policy in search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
MCTS explores likely world states sampled from LLMs to facilitate
better-reasoned decision-making. The commonsense policy from LLMs guides the
search to relevant parts of the tree, substantially reducing the search
complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in daily
task-planning experiments and highlight its advantages over using LLMs solely
as policies.

fine-grained clustered features, and M2D for Speech (M2D-S), which jointly
learns the denoising distillation task and M2D masked prediction task.

technique, called hereby the event-based method, was developed on the basis of
the so-called factorized Metropolis filter [Phys. Rev. E 99 010105 (2019)]. In
this work, we first explain step by step how the event-based method is

flexibly implemented in various update strategies, like the Metropolis and

Finally, we demonstrate the high efficiency of the event-based Monte Carlo

these models often struggle when applied to specialized domains like remote
sensing, and adapting to such domains is challenging due to the limited number
of image-text pairs available for training. To address this, we propose S-CLIP,
a semi-supervised learning method for training CLIP that utilizes additional
unpaired images. S-CLIP employs two pseudo-labeling strategies specifically
designed for contrastive learning and the language modality. The caption-level
pseudo-label is given by a combination of captions of paired images, obtained
by solving an optimal transport problem between unpaired and paired images. The
keyword-level pseudo-label is given by a keyword in the caption of the nearest
paired image, trained through partial label learning that assumes a candidate
set of labels for supervision instead of the exact one. By combining these
objectives, S-CLIP significantly enhances the training of CLIP using only a few
image-text pairs, as demonstrated in various specialist domains, including
remote sensing, fashion, scientific figures, and comics. For instance, S-CLIP
improves CLIP by 10% for zero-shot classification and 4% for image-text
retrieval on the remote sensing benchmark, matching the performance of
supervised CLIP while using three times fewer image-text pairs.

The latter two augment surrogate SRSs in two different ways. SRS ensemble

incorporating well-designed time-/frequency-domain modification functions,
which simulate and approximate the decision boundary of the target SRS and

supports rapid editing of garment shapes and texture by modifying individual 2D

we update the linear relationship between the non-radial frequency and mean

the potential difference related to heart activity using electrodes that can be

afforded by Ear-ECG is often accompanied by a corresponding degradation in
signal quality - a common obstacle that is shared by most wearable
technologies. We aim to resolve this issue by introducing a Deep Matched Filter
(Deep-MF) for the highly accurate detection of R-peaks in wearable ECG, thus
enhancing the utility of Ear-ECG in real-world scenarios. The Deep-MF consists
of an encoder stage (trained as part of an encoder-decoder module to reproduce
ground truth ECG), and an R-peak classifier stage. Through its operation as a
Matched Filter, the encoder searches for matches with an ECG template pattern
in the input signal, prior to filtering the matches with the subsequent
convolutional layers and selecting peaks corresponding to true ECG matches. The
so condensed latent representation of R-peak information is then fed into a
simple R-peak classifier, of which the output provides precise R-peak
locations. The proposed Deep Matched Filter is evaluated using
leave-one-subject-out cross validation over 36 subjects with an age range of
18-75, with the Deep-MF outperforming existing algorithms for R-peak detection
in noisy ECG. The Deep-MF achieves a median R-peak recall of 94.9\%, a median
precision of 91.2\% and an (AUC) value of 0.97. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the Deep Matched Filter algorithm not only retains the initialised ECG
kernel structure during the training process, but also amplifies portions of
the ECG which it deems most valuable. Overall, the Deep Matched Filter serves
as a valuable step forward for the real-world functionality of Ear-ECG and,
through its explainable operation, the acceptance of deep learning models in

First, performance in the few-shot setting is sensitive to the choice of

representation degradation caused by training each client model with fewer data

different clients. To this end, we propose a novel Associated Gaussian
Contrastive Learning (AGCL) framework based on learnable GMMs, which consists
of a Client Semantics Association (CSA) and a global-local GMM Contrastive

with limited local data. The global GCL encourages the model to produce more
discriminative representation with the comprehensive category relationships

estimate the individual value of the magnetic fields, we show that we cannot

large $L$. On the other hand, in our protocol, we can estimate theoretically
any moment of the field distribution by measuring a specific observable and

black-box, expensive-to-evaluate functions with respect to design variables,
while simultaneously efficiently integrating relevant contextual information
regarding the environment, such as experimental conditions. However, in many
practical scenarios, the relevance of contextual variables is not necessarily
known beforehand. Moreover, the contextual variables can sometimes be optimized
themselves, a setting that current CBO algorithms do not take into account.
Optimizing contextual variables may be costly, which raises the question of
determining a minimal relevant subset. In this paper, we frame this problem as
a cost-aware model selection BO task and address it using a novel method,
Sensitivity-Analysis-Driven Contextual BO (SADCBO). We learn the relevance of
context variables by sensitivity analysis of the posterior surrogate model at
specific input points, whilst minimizing the cost of optimization by leveraging
recent developments on early stopping for BO. We empirically evaluate our
proposed SADCBO against alternatives on synthetic experiments together with
extensive ablation studies, and demonstrate a consistent improvement across
examples.

designing new materials for metallurgy, catalysis, and other fields. One of the
core hypotheses of M/HEAs is lattice distortion. However, experimentally
determining the 3D local lattice distortion in M/HEAs remains a challenge.
Additionally, the presumed random elemental mixing in M/HEAs has been
questioned by atomistic simulations, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
(EDS), and electron diffraction, which suggest the existence of local chemical
order in M/HEAs. However, the 3D local chemical order has eluded direct
experimental observation since the EDS elemental maps integrate the composition
of atomic columns along the zone axes, and the diffuse reflections/streaks in
electron diffraction of M/HEAs may originate from planar defects. Here, we
determine the 3D atomic positions of M/HEA nanocrystals using atomic electron
tomography, and quantitatively characterize the local lattice distortion,
strain tensor, twin boundaries, dislocation cores, and chemical short-range
order (CSRO) with unprecedented 3D detail. We find that the local lattice
distortion and strain tensor in the HEAs are larger and more heterogeneous than
in the MEAs. We observe CSRO-mediated twinning in the MEAs. that is, twinning
occurs in energetically unfavoured CSRO regions but not in energetically
favoured CSRO ones. This observation confirms the atomistic simulation results
of the bulk CrCoNi MEA and represents the first experimental evidence of
correlating local chemical order with structural defects in any material
system. We expect that this work will not only expand our fundamental
understanding of this important class of materials, but also could provide the
foundation for tailoring M/HEA properties through lattice distortion and local

different methods. To resolve this, we examine how denoising autoencoding (DAE)

scales. Unlike prior studies, we use a realistic dataset of 100 directions and
consider many domain combinations of monolingual and test data. We find that
monolingual data generally helps MMT, but models are surprisingly brittle to
domain mismatches, especially at smaller model scales. BT is beneficial when
the parallel, monolingual, and test data sources are similar but can be
detrimental otherwise, while DAE is less effective than previously reported.
Next, we analyze the impact of scale (from 90M to 1.6B parameters) and find it
is important for both methods, particularly DAE. As scale increases, DAE
transitions from underperforming the parallel-only baseline at 90M to
converging with BT performance at 1.6B, and even surpassing it in low-resource.
These results offer new insights into how to best use monolingual data in MMT.

also noticeably different in the most distorted cases leading, for the
interpretation of observations, to modifications of the usual gravity darkening
generally obtained through the Roche model. Moreover we found that the dipolar

  Jing","Learning Remote Sensing Object Detection with Single Point Supervision","13 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pointly Supervised Object Detection (PSOD) has attracted considerable
interests due to its lower labeling cost as compared to box-level supervised
object detection. However, the complex scenes, densely packed and dynamic-scale
objects in Remote Sensing (RS) images hinder the development of PSOD methods in
RS field. In this paper, we make the first attempt to achieve RS object
detection with single point supervision, and propose a PSOD framework tailored
with RS images. Specifically, we design a point label upgrader (PLUG) to
generate pseudo box labels from single point labels, and then use the pseudo
boxes to supervise the optimization of existing detectors. Moreover, to handle
the challenge of the densely packed objects in RS images, we propose a sparse
feature guided semantic prediction module which can generate high-quality
semantic maps by fully exploiting informative cues from sparse objects.
Extensive ablation studies on the DOTA dataset have validated the effectiveness
of our method. Our method can achieve significantly better performance as
compared to state-of-the-art image-level and point-level supervised detection
methods, and reduce the performance gap between PSOD and box-level supervised
object detection. Code will be available at https://github.com/heshitian/PLUG.

applications. One question to ask is either they can efficiently be implemented
and executed on existing architectures. Current hardware suffers from
uncontrolled noise that can alter the expected results of one calculation. The
nature of this noise is different from one technology to another. In this work,
we chose to investigate a technology that is intrinsically resilient to
bit-flips: cat qubits. To this end, we implement two noise models. The first
one is hardware-agnostic -- in the sense that it is used in the literature to
cover different hardware types. The second one is specific to cat qubits. We
perform simulations on two types of problems that can be formulated with VQAs
(Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Variatinoal Quantum
Linear Soler (VQLS)), study the impact of noise on the evolution of the cost
function and extract noise level thresholds from which a noise-resilient regime
can be considered. By tackling compilation issues, we discuss the need of
implementing hardware-specific noise models as hardware-agnostic ones can lead
to misleading conclusions regarding the regime of noise that is acceptable for
an algorithm to run.

to achieve a total expected reward objective. As finding optimal controllers is
undecidable, we concentrate on synthesising good finite-state controllers

POMDP controller synthesis: a belief-based and an inductive approach. The
former method obtains an FSC from a finite fragment of the so-called belief
MDP, an MDP that keeps track of the probabilities of equally observable POMDP
states. The latter is an inductive search technique over a set of FSCs, e.g.,
controllers with a fixed memory size. The key result of this paper is a
symbiotic anytime algorithm that tightly integrates both approaches such that
each profits from the controllers constructed by the other. Experimental
results indicate a substantial improvement in the value of the controllers
while significantly reducing the synthesis time and memory footprint.

prohibitive cost of full fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless,
the enormous size of LLMs impedes routine deployment. To address the issue, we
present Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA), a novel
quantization-aware PEFT technique that facilitates model compression and
accelerates inference. PEQA operates through a dual-stage process: initially,
the parameter matrix of each fully-connected layer undergoes quantization into
a matrix of low-bit integers and a scalar vector; subsequently, fine-tuning
occurs on the scalar vector for each downstream task. Such a strategy
compresses the size of the model considerably, leading to a lower inference
latency upon deployment and a reduction in the overall memory required. At the
same time, fast fine-tuning and efficient task switching becomes possible. In
this way, PEQA offers the benefits of quantization, while inheriting the
advantages of PEFT. We compare PEQA with competitive baselines in comprehensive
experiments ranging from natural language understanding to generation
benchmarks. This is done using large language models of up to $65$ billion
parameters, demonstrating PEQA's scalability, task-specific adaptation
performance, and ability to follow instructions, even in extremely low-bit

different luminance contrasts, such that attention on a weak target stimulus
would have to overcome a large activation difference to a strong distracter. In
this situation we found unexpectedly large attentional target facilitation in
macaque V1/V2 which far surpasses known magnitudes of attentional modulation.
Target facilitation scales with contrast difference and combines with
distracter suppression to achieve the required rate advantage. These effects
can be explained by a contrast-independent attentional control mechanism with

high-dimensional, as traditional methods do not scale well and are often
limited to specific problem structures. To address this issue, we propose a
novel approach to solve the stabilize-avoid problem via the solution of an
infinite-horizon constrained optimal control problem (OCP). We transform the
constrained OCP into epigraph form and obtain a two-stage optimization problem
that optimizes over the policy in the inner problem and over an auxiliary
variable in the outer problem. We then propose a new method for this
formulation that combines an on-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm
with neural network regression. Our method yields better stability during
training, avoids instabilities caused by saddle-point finding, and is not
restricted to specific requirements on the problem structure compared to more
traditional methods. We validate our approach on different benchmark tasks,
ranging from low-dimensional toy examples to an F16 fighter jet with a
17-dimensional state space. Simulation results show that our approach
consistently yields controllers that match or exceed the safety of existing

$P_{\mathrm{orb}}=0.217320523(8)\;\mathrm{d}$ is continuously increasing with
the rate of $\dot{P}_{\mathrm{orb}} = +7.6(5)\times10^{-9}$ d year$^{-1}$. The
mass transfer rate varies between 2.4$\times$10$^{-10}$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$
in quiescence up to 1.36$\times$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$ in outburst.
The accretion disk transitions from the cooler, flared, steady-state disk to a
warmer state with a practically constant and relatively high disk height. The
mass transfer rate is about 1.6$\times$10$^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$ in the

contemporary art museum would acquire their works. Here we collect and analyze
data from 12 European contemporary art museums, taking into account artwork
creation dates, collection acquisition dates, and the associated artist age at
both points in time. From this simple quantitative construct we are able to
reveal a striking gradient of museum profiles at the aggregate level. This lag
can function to constitute a macroeconomic index of ""mean museum collection
lag"", ranging from 3 years in the most dynamic cases (Kiasma) to 33 years in
the most established institutions (Reina Sofia). Meanwhile, on the granular
level, plotting artist age over collection year, and using artist-age vs

individual museums are characterized by shared patterns and a rich
heterogeneity of ideographic details. Regularities include continuous
acquisitions, systematic acquisition of older materials over time, and brief
bursts, where whole oeuvres of individual artists join specific collections.
Hence, we are able to shed light on the detailed collection history of museums,

In this work, we first extend the typical complexity results for the
subgradient method to convex and weakly convex minimization without assuming
Lipschitz continuity. Specifically, we establish $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$
bound in terms of the suboptimality gap ``$f(x) - f^*$'' for convex case and
$\mathcal{O}(1/{T}^{1/4})$ bound in terms of the gradient of the Moreau
envelope function for weakly convex case. Furthermore, we provide convergence
results for non-Lipschitz convex and weakly convex objective functions using
proper diminishing rules on the step sizes. In particular, when $f$ is convex,
we show $\mathcal{O}(\log(k)/\sqrt{k})$ rate of convergence in terms of the
suboptimality gap. With an additional quadratic growth condition, the rate is
improved to $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ in terms of the squared distance to the optimal
solution set. When $f$ is weakly convex, asymptotic convergence is derived. The
central idea is that the dynamics of properly chosen step sizes rule fully
controls the movement of the subgradient method, which leads to boundedness of
the iterates, and then a trajectory-based analysis can be conducted to
establish the desired results. To further illustrate the wide applicability of
our framework, we extend the complexity results to the truncated subgradient,
the stochastic subgradient, the incremental subgradient, and the proximal
subgradient methods for non-Lipschitz functions.

finite string-order parameter in the topological regime. The results are
analysed by using an exact mapping from the quantum expectation values over the

function, and (iii) use such estimate to run a reverse process. As the reverse
process is initialized with the stationary distribution of the forward one, the
existing analysis paradigm requires $T_1\to\infty$. This is however
problematic: from a theoretical viewpoint, for a given precision of the score

practical viewpoint, a large $T_1$ increases computational costs and leads to
error propagation. This paper addresses the issue by considering a version of
the popular predictor-corrector scheme: after running the forward process, we
first estimate the final distribution via an inexact Langevin dynamics and then
revert the process. Our key technical contribution is to provide convergence
guarantees in Wasserstein distance which require to run the forward process

on the input dimension and the subgaussian norm of the target distribution,

breakthroughs have been made in natural language processing and image
representation learning, it is still challenging for video models to reach it

existing works leverage image foundation models' prior knowledge and equip them
with efficient temporal modules. Despite the satisfactory fine-tuning
performance, we empirically find they fall short of out-of-the-box usage, given
the even degraded performance in zero-shot/linear protocols compared to their

degradation from the perspective of language supervision distortion. We argue
that tuning a text encoder end-to-end, as done in previous work, is suboptimal
since it may overfit in terms of styles, thereby losing its original
generalization ability to capture the semantics of various language registers.
The overfitted text encoder, in turn, provides a harmful supervision signal,
degrading the video representation. To tackle this issue, we propose a
degradation-free pre-training strategy to retain the generalization ability of
the text encoder via freezing shallow layers while enabling the task-related
semantics capturing in tunable deep layers. As for the training objective, we
adopted the transcript sorting task in TVTS incorporated with masking
techniques to enable scalable training. As a result, we produce a series of

ecosystem into the Earth's atmosphere are an important component of atmospheric
chemistry. Due to the scarcity of measurement, a reliable enhancement of BVOCs
emission maps can aid in providing denser data for atmospheric chemical,
climate, and air quality models. In this work, we propose a strategy to
super-resolve coarse BVOC emission maps by simultaneously exploiting the
contributions of different compounds. To this purpose, we first accurately
investigate the spatial inter-connections between several BVOC species. Then,
we exploit the found similarities to build a Multi-Image Super-Resolution
(MISR) system, in which a number of emission maps associated with diverse
compounds are aggregated to boost Super-Resolution (SR) performance. We compare
different configurations regarding the species and the number of joined BVOCs.
Our experimental results show that incorporating BVOCs' relationship into the
process can substantially improve the accuracy of the super-resolved maps.
Interestingly, the best results are achieved when we aggregate the emission
maps of strongly uncorrelated compounds. This peculiarity seems to confirm what
was already guessed for other data-domains, i.e., joined uncorrelated
information are more helpful than correlated ones to boost MISR performance.
Nonetheless, the proposed work represents the first attempt in SR of BVOC
emissions through the fusion of multiple different compounds.

faces three major challenges: the high cost of data collection, the lack of
trustworthy evaluation, and the absence of reference method implementations. We
address these challenges with AlpacaFarm, a simulator that enables research and
development for learning from feedback at a low cost. First, we design LLM
prompts to simulate human feedback that are 45x cheaper than crowdworkers and
display high agreement with humans. Second, we propose an automatic evaluation
and validate it against human instructions obtained on real-world interactions.
Third, we contribute reference implementations for several methods (PPO,
best-of-n, expert iteration, and more) that learn from pairwise feedback.
Finally, as an end-to-end validation of AlpacaFarm, we train and evaluate
eleven models on 10k pairs of real human feedback and show that rankings of
models trained in AlpacaFarm match rankings of models trained on human data. As
a demonstration of the research possible in AlpacaFarm, we find that methods
that use a reward model can substantially improve over supervised fine-tuning

can exacerbate discrimination against certain groups and cause significant

model performance. In this paper, we propose FITNESS, a bias mitigation
approach via de-correlating the causal effects between sensitive features
(e.g., the sex) and the label. Our key idea is that by de-correlating such
effects from a causality perspective, the model would avoid making predictions
based on sensitive features and thus fairness could be improved. Furthermore,
FITNESS leverages multi-objective optimization to achieve a better
performance-fairness trade-off. To evaluate the effectiveness, we compare
FITNESS with 7 state-of-the-art methods in 8 benchmark tasks by multiple

introduces the author's semantic information G theory with the rate-fidelity
function R(G) (G denotes SeMI, and R(G) extends R(D)) and its applications to
multi-label learning, the maximum Mutual Information (MI) classification, and

between SeMI and Shan-non's MI, two generalized entropies (fuzzy entropy and
coverage entropy), Autoencoders, Gibbs distributions, and partition functions
from the perspective of the R(G) function or the G theory. An important
conclusion is that mixture models and Restricted Boltzmann Machines converge
because SeMI is maximized, and Shannon's MI is minimized, making information
efficiency G/R close to 1. A potential opportunity is to simplify deep learning
by using Gaussian channel mixture models for pre-training deep neural networks'
latent layers without considering gradients. It also discusses how the SeMI

Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion in a reactive medium creates a shock

to thermonuclear supernovae (SNe Ia). The aim of this study is to impose
constraints on the PBH to dark matter (DM) abundance fraction, $f_{\rm PBH}$,
via comparing the SN Ia event rates between PBH hypotheses and observational

  Adversarial Decomposed-VAE for Analyzing MCI",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Integrating the brain structural and functional connectivity features is of
great significance in both exploring brain science and analyzing cognitive
impairment clinically. However, it remains a challenge to effectively fuse
structural and functional features in exploring the brain network. In this
paper, a novel brain structure-function fusing-representation learning (BSFL)
model is proposed to effectively learn fused representation from diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. Specifically, the
decomposition-fusion framework is developed to first decompose the feature
space into the union of the uniform and the unique spaces for each modality,
and then adaptively fuse the decomposed features to learn MCI-related
representation. Moreover, a knowledge-aware transformer module is designed to
automatically capture local and global connectivity features throughout the
brain. Also, a uniform-unique contrastive loss is further devised to make the
decomposition more effective and enhance the complementarity of structural and
functional features. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
model achieves better performance than other competitive methods in predicting
and analyzing MCI. More importantly, the proposed model could be a potential
tool for reconstructing unified brain networks and predicting abnormal
connections during the degenerative processes in MCI.

recruitment/derecruitment (RD), which reproduces the underlying characteristics
typically observed in injured lungs. The basic idea is a pressure- and
time-dependent variation of the stress-free reference volume in reduced
dimensional viscoelastic elements representing the acinar tissue. We choose a
variable reference volume triggered by critical opening and closing pressures
in a time-dependent manner from a straightforward mechanical point of view. In
the case of (partially and progressively) collapsing alveolar structures, the
volume available for expansion during breathing reduces and vice versa,
eventually enabling consideration of alveolar collapse and reopening in our
model. We further introduce a method to patient-specifically determine the
underlying critical parameters of the new alveolar RD dynamics when integrated
into the tissue elements, referred to as terminal units, of a spatially
resolved physics-based lung model that simulates the human respiratory system
in an anatomically correct manner. Relevant patient-specific parameters of the
terminal units are herein determined based on medical image data and the
macromechanical behavior of the lung during artificial ventilation. We test the
whole modeling approach for a real-life scenario by applying it to the clinical
data of a mechanically ventilated patient. The generated lung model is capable
to reproduce clinical measurements such as tidal volume and pleural pressure
during various ventilation maneuvers. We conclude that this new model is an
important step towards personalized treatment of ARDS patients by considering
potentially harmful mechanisms - such as cyclic RD and overdistension - and
might help to develop relevant protective ventilation strategies to reduce
ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI).

building block of all the nodal-rings in TaAs & TaP. This nodal-arc is found to
be capable of generating all the nodal-rings in these materials upon the
application of space-group symmetry operations including time-reversal
symmetry. The arcs are obtained to be dispersive with the energy spread of
$\sim$109 ($\sim$204) meV in TaAs (TaP). Also, the orbitals leading to
bands-inversion and thus the formation of nodal-arcs are found to be Ta-5d &
As-4p (P-3p) in TaAs (TaP). The area of nodal-rings is found to be highly
sensitive to the change in hybridization-strength, where the increase in
hybridization-strength leads to the decrease in the area of nodal-rings. In the
presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), all the points on these arcs get
gaped-up and two pairs of Weyl-nodes are found to evolve from them. Out of the
two pair, one is found to be situated close to the joining point of the two
arcs forming a ring. This causes the evolution of each nodal-ring into three
pairs of Weyl-nodes. The coordinates of these Weyl-nodes are found to be robust
to the increase in SOC-strength from $\sim$ 0.7-3.5 eV. All the results are
obtained at the first-principle level. This work provides a clear picture of
the existence of nodal-arc due to accidental degeneracy and its evolution into

never been measured for graphite. Here, based on a detailed band structure
calculation including spin-orbit coupling, we predict an unexpected behavior of
the relaxation times. We find, based on saturation ESR measurements, that $T_1$
is markedly different from $T_2$. Spins injected with perpendicular
polarization with respect to the graphene plane have an extraordinarily long
lifetime of $100$ ns at room temperature. This is ten times more than in the
best graphene samples. The spin diffusion length across graphite planes is thus
expected to be ultralong, on the scale of $\sim 70~\mu$m, suggesting that thin
films of graphite -- or multilayer AB graphene stacks -- can be excellent
platforms for spintronics applications compatible with 2D van der Waals
technologies. Finally, we provide a qualitative account of the observed spin

power-law distribution, can be observed in the migratory behavior of organisms
at various levels. Levy walks with power exponents close to 2 are observed, and
the reasons are unclear. This study aims to propose a model that universally
generates inverse square Levy walks (called Cauchy walks) and to identify the
conditions under which Cauchy walks appear. We demonstrate that Cauchy walks
emerge universally in goal-oriented tasks. We use the term ""goal-oriented"" when
the goal is clear, but this can be achieved in different ways, which cannot be
uniquely determined. We performed a simulation in which an agent observed the
data generated from a probability distribution in a two-dimensional space and
successively estimated the central coordinates of that probability
distribution. The agent has a model of probability distribution as a hypothesis
for data-generating distribution and can modify the model such that each time a
data point is observed, thereby increasing the estimated probability of
occurrence of the observed data. To achieve this, the center coordinates of the
model must be moved closer to those of the observed data. However, in the case
of a two-dimensional space, arbitrariness arises in the direction of correction
of the center; this task is goal oriented. We analyze two cases: a strategy
that allocates the amount of modification randomly in the x- and y-directions,
and a strategy that determines allocation such that movement is minimized. The
results reveal that when a random strategy is used, the Cauchy walk appears.
When the minimum strategy is used, the Brownian walk appears. The presence or
absence of the constraint of minimizing the amount of movement may be a factor
that causes the difference between Brownian and Levy walks.

well-known that when confronting complex reasoning challenges, humans typically
employ various cognitive abilities, and necessitate interaction with all
aspects of tools, knowledge, and the external environment information to
accomplish intricate tasks. This paper introduces a novel intelligent
framework, referred to as OlaGPT. OlaGPT carefully studied a cognitive
architecture framework, and propose to simulate certain aspects of human
cognition. The framework involves approximating different cognitive modules,
including attention, memory, reasoning, learning, and corresponding scheduling
and decision-making mechanisms. Inspired by the active learning mechanism of
human beings, it proposes a learning unit to record previous mistakes and
expert opinions, and dynamically refer to them to strengthen their ability to
solve similar problems. The paper also outlines common effective reasoning
frameworks for human problem-solving and designs Chain-of-Thought (COT)
templates accordingly. A comprehensive decision-making mechanism is also
proposed to maximize model accuracy. The efficacy of OlaGPT has been
stringently evaluated on multiple reasoning datasets, and the experimental

pseudo-label generation module and robust representation learning module. The
former generates pseudo-labels to provide supervision for the later, which
contributes to more robust representations and correctly separated clusters. To
provide robustness against the imbalance in data, we propose self-adaptive
optimal transport in the pseudo-label generation module. To improve robustness

traditionally assumed white-box access to the model, and work by modifying its
parameters. However, this is incompatible with a recent trend in the field,
where the highest quality models are only available as black-boxes through
inference APIs. Even when the model weights are available, the computational
cost of fine-tuning large LMs can be prohibitive for most practitioners. In
this work, we present a lightweight method for adapting large LMs to new
domains and tasks, assuming no access to their weights or intermediate
activations. Our approach fine-tunes a small white-box LM and combines it with
the large black-box LM at the probability level through a small network,
learned on a small validation set. We validate our approach by adapting a large
LM (OPT-30B) to several domains and a downstream task (machine translation),
observing improved performance in all cases, of up to 9%, while using a domain
expert 23x smaller.

non-stationarity of the multi-agent environment, the mainstream method is to
adopt the framework of Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE).
This thesis is based on the framework of CTDE, and studies the cooperative
decision-making of multi-agent based on the Multi-Agent Proximal Policy
Optimization (MAPPO) algorithm for multi-agent proximal policy optimization. In
order to alleviate the non-stationarity of the multi-agent environment, a
multi-agent communication mechanism based on weight scheduling and attention
module is introduced. Different agents can alleviate the non-stationarity
caused by local observations through information exchange between agents,
assisting in the collaborative decision-making of agents. The specific method
is to introduce a communication module in the policy network part. The
communication module is composed of a weight generator, a weight scheduler, a
message encoder, a message pool and an attention module. Among them, the weight
generator and weight scheduler will generate weights as the selection basis for
communication, the message encoder is used to compress and encode communication
information, the message pool is used to store communication messages, and the
attention module realizes the interactive processing of the agent's own
information and communication information. This thesis proposes a Multi-Agent
Communication and Global Information Optimization Proximal Policy
Optimization(MCGOPPO)algorithm, and conducted experiments in the SMAC and the
MPE. The experimental results show that the improvement has achieved certain
effects, which can better alleviate the non-stationarity of the multi-agent
environment, and improve the collaborative decision-making ability among the
agents.

Language Models (LLMs) with tools that allow for knowledge retrieval and action
execution. Existing ALM systems trigger LLM thought processes while pulling
observations from these tools in an interleaved fashion. Specifically, an LLM
reasons to call an external tool, gets halted to fetch the tool's response, and
then decides the next action based on all preceding response tokens. Such a
paradigm, though straightforward and easy to implement, often leads to huge
computation complexity from redundant prompts and repeated execution. This
study addresses such challenges for the first time, proposing a modular
paradigm ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation) that detaches the reasoning
process from external observations, thus significantly reducing token
consumption. Comprehensive evaluations across six public NLP benchmarks and a
curated dataset reveal consistent performance enhancements with our proposed
methodology. Notably, ReWOO achieves 5x token efficiency and 4% accuracy
improvement on HotpotQA, a multi-step reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, ReWOO
demonstrates robustness under tool-failure scenarios. Beyond prompt efficiency,
decoupling parametric modules from non-parametric tool calls enables
instruction fine-tuning to offload LLMs into smaller language models, thus
substantially reducing model parameters. Our illustrative work offloads
reasoning ability from 175B GPT3.5 into 7B LLaMA, demonstrating the significant

individual reflections on ChatGPT use. Analysis of survey responses showed
significant main effects of topics on collaborative interdisciplinary

riding horse"", but fail to generate other relations composed of the same basic
parts, i.e., ""horse riding astronaut"". These failures are often taken as
evidence that the models rely on training priors rather than constructing novel
images compositionally. This paper tests this intuition directly on the
stablediffusion 2.1 text-to-image model. By looking at the subject-verb-object
(SVO) triads that form the backbone of these prompts (e.g., ""astronaut"",
""ride"", ""horse""), we find that the more often an SVO triad appears in the
training data, the better the model can generate an image aligned with that
triad. Here, by aligned we mean that each of the terms appears in the generated
image in the proper relation to each other. However, this increased frequency
also diminishes how well the model can generate an image aligned with the
flipped triad. For example, if ""astronaut riding horse"" appears frequently in
the training data, the image for ""horse riding astronaut"" will tend to be
poorly aligned. We also find that models often struggle to generate terms in
atypical roles, e.g., if ""horse"" is more often the semantic patient (object),
the model might struggle to visualize it as a semantic agent (subject). Our
results thus show that current models are biased to generate images aligned
with relations seen in training and provide important new data in the ongoing

structure in a traditional sense, or rather, interpolate between relations
explicitly seen in the training data.

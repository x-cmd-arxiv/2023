conditions on a few input-output pairs (demonstrations) and a test input, and
directly outputs the prediction. It has been shown highly dependent on the
provided demonstrations and thus promotes the research of demonstration
retrieval: given a test input, relevant examples are retrieved from the
training set to serve as informative demonstrations for in-context learning.
While previous works focus on training task-specific retrievers for several
tasks separately, these methods are often hard to transfer and scale on various
tasks, and separately trained retrievers incur a lot of parameter storage and
deployment cost. In this paper, we propose Unified Demonstration Retriever
(\textbf{UDR}), a single model to retrieve demonstrations for a wide range of
tasks. To train UDR, we cast various tasks' training signals into a unified
list-wise ranking formulation by language model's feedback. Then we propose a
multi-task list-wise ranking training framework, with an iterative mining
strategy to find high-quality candidates, which can help UDR fully incorporate
various tasks' signals. Experiments on 30+ tasks across 13 task families and
multiple data domains show that UDR significantly outperforms baselines.
Further analyses show the effectiveness of each proposed component and UDR's
strong ability in various scenarios including different LMs (1.3B - 175B),

to separate in the entangled chronological items. However, few attempts have
been made to train SR in the frequency domain, and it is still unclear how to

design a frequency ramp structure to allow the learnable filter slide on the
frequency spectrums across different layers to capture different frequency

Split (SFS) module are proposed to replace the self-attention module for
effectively extracting frequency information in two ways. DFS is used to select
helpful frequency components dynamically, and SFS is combined with the dynamic
frequency selection module to provide a more fine-grained frequency division.
Finally, contrastive learning is utilized to improve the quality of user

five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate our proposed model performs
significantly better than the state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is

people more likely to experience frequent, spontaneous seizures. There has to
be an accurate automated method for measuring seizure frequency and severity in
order to assess the efficacy of pharmacological therapy for epilepsy. The drug
quantities are often derived from patient reports which may cause significant
issues owing to inadequate or inaccurate descriptions of seizures and their
frequencies. Methods and materials: This study proposes a novel deep learning
architecture based lightweight convolution transformer (LCT). The transformer
is able to learn spatial and temporal correlated information simultaneously
from the multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to detect seizures at
smaller segment lengths. In the proposed model, the lack of translation
equivariance and localization of ViT is reduced using convolution tokenization,
and rich information from the transformer encoder is extracted by sequence
pooling instead of the learnable class token. Results: Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model of cross-patient learning can
effectively detect seizures from the raw EEG signals. The accuracy and F1-score
of seizure detection in the cross-patient case on the CHB-MIT dataset are shown
to be 96.31% and 96.32%, respectively, at 0.5 sec segment length. In addition,
the performance metrics show that the inclusion of inductive biases and
attention-based pooling in the model enhances the performance and reduces the
number of transformer encoder layers, which significantly reduces the
computational complexity. In this research work, we provided a novel approach
to enhance efficiency and simplify the architecture for multi-channel automated
seizure detection.

suggested as suitable replacements for silicon channels in field-effect
transistors (FETs). Specifically, two materials of MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and
WSi$_2$N$_4$ due to their very desirable electrical and thermal properties are
noticed. On the other hand, the reliability of transistors, which is determined
by the maximum temperature they obtain during the performance, specifies the
usefulness of the newly proposed channels for thermal management solution. In
this work, the FETs, including MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$ channels, are
investigated using Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann equation. In
particular, the phonon analysis has been carried out to investigate the peak
temperature rise. Our calculations confirm that MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$
present lower maximum temperature than the previously suggested candidate, the
blue phosphorene (BP) which itself reaches a shallow temperature. Concretely,
the phonon exploration shows that the competition between the dominant heat
carrier velocity, and its related frequency settles the maximum temperature
value. The material WSi$_2$N$_4$ with much more phonons in TA mode, with almost
high velocity and relatively low-frequency, shows adequate thermal condition,
and its peak temperature is very low, say 110 K, less than that of BP. The
material MoSi$_2$N$_4$ attains the maximum temperature of only 10 K less than
BP peak temperature. This behavior attributes to the dominant LA phonons which
are fast but also have high frequency and consequently make the temperature get
larger than that of the WSi$_2$N$_4$. In summary, WSi$_2$N$_4$, with very low
peak temperature, and in the next step MoSi$_2$N$_4$, both with beneficial
electrical/thermal properties, are suggested as very suitable candidates for
producing more reliable FETs, fulfilling the thermal management.

our proposed Neural Voting Field (NVF) fully models 3D dense local evidence and
hand global geometry, helping to alleviate common 2D-to-3D ambiguities.
Specifically, for a 3D query point in camera frustum and its pixel-aligned

signed distance to the hand surface; (ii) a set of 4D offset vectors (1D voting
weight and 3D directional vector to each hand joint). Following a vote-casting
scheme, 4D offset vectors from near-surface points are selected to calculate
the 3D hand joint coordinates by a weighted average. Experiments demonstrate
that NVF outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms on FreiHAND dataset

Contemporary automatic fact-checking systems focus on estimating truthfulness

investigated. Incompressibility and axial symmetry are assumed, together with a
buoyancy discontinuity at the boundary. The boundary turns into a vortex sheet
and the system evolves into a ring. Contrary to the case of mechanically
generated rings, buoyancy-driven rings are unstable. This is due to the
generation of negative vorticity at the bottom. Furthermore, a sequence of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities arises along the buoyancy anomaly boundary. This
sequence transfers the energy toward large scales with $\kappa^{-3}$
distribution. The vortex blob method has been used to simulate the system
numerically. An optimization algorithm, used previously in two dimensions, has
been extended to the axisymmetric case. It reduces computational complexity
from $N^2$ to $N \log N$, where N is the number of nodes. Additionally, a new

points (EPs) have been explored for lasing, controlling light transport, and
enhancing a sensor s response. A ring resonator can be brought to an EP by
controlling the coupling between its frequency degenerate clockwise and
counterclockwise traveling modes. This has been typically achieved by
introducing two or more nanotips into the resonator s mode volume. While this
method provides a route to study EP physics, the basic understanding of how the
nanotips shape and size symmetry impact the system s non-Hermicity is missing,
along with additional loss from both in-plane and out-of-plane scattering. The
limited resonance stability poses a challenge for leveraging EP effects for
switches or modulators, which requires stable cavity resonance and fixed
laser-cavity detuning. Here we use lithographically defined asymmetric and
symmetric Mie scatterers, which enable subwavelength control of wave
transmission and reflections without deflecting to additional radiation
channels. We show that those pre-defined Mie scatterers can bring the system to
an EP without post tuning, as well as enable chiral light transport within the
resonator. Counterintuitively, the Mie scatterer results in enhanced quality
factor measured on the transmission port, through coherently suppressing the
backscattering from the waveguide surface roughness. The proposed device
platform enables pre-defined chiral light propagation and backscattering-free
resonances, needed for various applications such as frequency combs, solitons,

partitions of perceptual color space modulated by the relative needs to
communicate about different colors. These psychophysical and communicative
constraints help explain why languages around the world have remarkably
similar, but not identical, mappings of colors to color terms. Languages
converge on a small set of efficient representations. But languages also
evolve, and the number of terms in a color vocabulary may change over time.
Here we show that history, i.e. the existence of an antecedent color
vocabulary, acts as a non-adaptive constraint that biases the choice of
efficient solution as a language transitions from a vocabulary of size n to n+1
terms. Moreover, as vocabularies evolve to include more terms they explore a
smaller fraction of all possible efficient vocabularies compared to
equally-sized vocabularies constructed de novo. This path dependence on the
cultural evolution of color naming presents an opportunity. Historical
constraints can be used to reconstruct ancestral color vocabularies, allowing
us to answer long-standing questions about the evolutionary sequences of color
words, and enabling us to draw inferences from phylogenetic patterns of

bottom up, beginning from the logical form's leaves. The system we introduce is
lazy in that it incrementally builds up a set of potential semantic parses, but
only expands and processes the most promising candidate parses at each
generation step. Such a parsimonious expansion scheme allows the system to
maintain an arbitrarily large set of parse hypotheses that are never realized
and thus incur minimal computational overhead. We evaluate our approach on
compositional generalization; specifically, on the challenging CFQ dataset and

  axisymmetric Einstein-Vlasov system","18 pages, 7 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider gravitational collapse for the axially symmetric Einstein-Vlasov
system. We investigate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture in the case of
highly prolate initial data and we investigate the ``only if"" part of the Hoop
conjecture. Shapiro and Teukolsky initiated a similar study in 1991
\cite{Shapiro1991} where they found support that the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture was violated for sufficiently prolate spheroidal initial data. More
recently, independent studies of this problem have been carried out by Yoo,
Harada and Okawa \cite{Yoo2017} and by East \cite{East2019}. A common feature
in these works is that the initial data are dust-like. Dust can be considered
as a \textit{singular} case of matter described by the Einstein-Vlasov system.
The original motivation by Shapiro and Teukolsky to study this problem is based
on the Lin-Mestel-Shu instability for gravitational collapse of uniform
spheroids in the case of dust in Newtonian gravity. We argue that the
Lin-Mestel-Shu solution is not relevant for studying the weak cosmic censorship
of the Einstein-Vlasov system and we argue that dust-like initial data is also
not relevant. To investigate collapse of highly prolate spheroidal
configurations for the Einstein-Vlasov system is nevertheless interesting in
view of the Hoop conjecture. By choosing highly prolate initial data the weak
cosmic censorship conjecture is seriously tested. We carry out such a study for
initial data which are not dust-like. We find formation of an apparent horizon
in all cases we consider, which provides support for the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture. In our tests of the Hoop conjecture we compute the polar
circumference $\mathcal{C}_{H,p}$ at the time when the apparent horizon forms
and find that it is less than 12% above $4\pi M$, where $M$ is the irreducible
mass of the apparent horizon, which agrees with the spirit of the Hoop
conjecture.

maximize the expected cumulative discounted sum of an external reward signal,
i.e., the expected return. In practice, in many tasks of interest, such as
policy optimization, the agent usually spends its interaction budget by
collecting episodes of fixed length within a simulator (i.e., Monte Carlo
simulation). However, given the discounted nature of the RL objective, this
data collection strategy might not be the best option. Indeed, the rewards
taken in early simulation steps weigh exponentially more than future rewards.
Taking a cue from this intuition, in this paper, we design an a-priori budget
allocation strategy that leads to the collection of trajectories of different
lengths, i.e., truncated. The proposed approach provably minimizes the width of
the confidence intervals around the empirical estimates of the expected return
of a policy. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we make
use of our trajectory truncation mechanism to extend Policy Optimization via
Importance Sampling (POIS, Metelli et al., 2018) algorithm. Finally, we conduct
a numerical comparison between our algorithm and POIS: the results are
consistent with our theory and show that an appropriate truncation of the
trajectories can succeed in improving performance.

contracts caused by the fact that agents may themselves deploy smart contracts.
Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the assumption that
players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However, equilibria obtained
in this fashion do not hold in general in vivo, when games are deployed on a
blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes fundamental
game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game, specifically a Stackelberg
game with multiple commitments, wherein agents strategize to deploy the best
contracts. Not taking these commitment capabilities into account thus fails to
capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in practice. A game
that remains secure when the agents can deploy contracts is said to be
Stackelberg resilient. We show that Stackelberg resilience can be computed
efficiently for any two-player game of perfect information and show that it is
hard to compute in general. We show that if a game is Stackelberg
$k$-resilient, that is, resilient when there are $k$ contracts, it is also
resilient when there are fewer contracts. We demonstrate the non-triviality of
side contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized
commerce from the literature. These contracts have the same intended
functionality, but we show that only one is Stackelberg resilient.
  Our work highlights an issue that is necessary to address to ensure the
secure deployment of smart contracts and suggests that other contracts already
deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.

This paper focuses on two biases associated with the NSUM. First, different
populations are known to have different average social network sizes,
introducing degree ratio bias. This is especially true for marginalized
populations like sex workers and drug users, where members tend to have smaller
social networks than the average person. Second, large subpopulations are
weighted more heavily than small subpopulations in current NSUM estimators,
leading to poor size estimates of small subpopulations. We show how the degree
ratio affects size estimates, provide a method to estimate degree ratios
without collecting additional data, and demonstrate that rescaling size
estimates improves the estimates for smaller subpopulations. We demonstrate
that our adjustment procedures improve the accuracy of NSUM size estimates

(KURVS), aimed at studying the outer rotation curves shape and dark matter
content of 22 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1.5$. These galaxies represent
`typical' star-forming discs at $z \sim 1.5$, being located within the
star-forming main sequence and stellar mass-size relation with stellar masses
$9.5\leqslant$log$(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}})\leqslant11.5$. We extract
individual rotation curves out to 4 times the effective radius, on average, or
$\sim 10-15$ kpc. Most rotation curves are flat or rising between three- and
six-disc scale radii. Only three objects with dispersion-dominated dynamics
($v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0\sim0.2$) have declining outer rotation curves at more
than 5$\sigma$ significance. After accounting for seeing and pressure support,
the nine rotation-dominated discs with $v_{\rm rot}/\sigma_0\geqslant1.5$ have
average dark matter fractions of $50 \pm 20\%$ at the effective radius, similar
to local discs. Together with previous observations of star-forming galaxies at
cosmic noon, our measurements suggest a trend of declining dark matter fraction
with increasing stellar mass and stellar mass surface density at the effective
radius. Simulated EAGLE galaxies are in quantitative agreement with
observations up to log$(M_{\star}R_{\rm eff}^{-2}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}kpc^{-2}})
\sim 9.2$, and over-predict the dark matter fraction of galaxies with higher
mass surface densities by a factor of $\sim 3$. We conclude that the dynamics
of typical rotationally-supported discs at $z \sim 1.5$ is dominated by dark
matter from effective radius scales, in broad agreement with cosmological
models. The tension with observations at high stellar mass surface density
suggests that the prescriptions for baryonic processes occurring in the most
massive galaxies (such as bulge growth and quenching) need to be reassessed.

adding biasing features to model inputs -- e.g., by reordering the
multiple-choice options in a few-shot prompt to make the answer always ""(A)"" --
which models systematically fail to mention in their explanations. When we bias
models toward incorrect answers, they frequently generate CoT explanations
supporting those answers. This causes accuracy to drop by as much as 36% on a

justify giving answers in line with stereotypes without mentioning the

can be plausible yet misleading, which risks increasing our trust in LLMs

results highlight the need for targeted efforts to evaluate and improve

  Models",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV cs.NA math.NA stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Diffusion models have emerged as a key pillar of foundation models in visual
domains. One of their critical applications is to universally solve different
downstream inverse tasks via a single diffusion prior without re-training for
each task. Most inverse tasks can be formulated as inferring a posterior
distribution over data (e.g., a full image) given a measurement (e.g., a masked
image). This is however challenging in diffusion models since the nonlinear and
iterative nature of the diffusion process renders the posterior intractable. To
cope with this challenge, we propose a variational approach that by design
seeks to approximate the true posterior distribution. We show that our approach
naturally leads to regularization by denoising diffusion process (RED-Diff)
where denoisers at different timesteps concurrently impose different structural
constraints over the image. To gauge the contribution of denoisers from
different timesteps, we propose a weighting mechanism based on
signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our approach provides a new variational
perspective for solving inverse problems with diffusion models, allowing us to
formulate sampling as stochastic optimization, where one can simply apply
off-the-shelf solvers with lightweight iterates. Our experiments for image
restoration tasks such as inpainting and superresolution demonstrate the
strengths of our method compared with state-of-the-art sampling-based diffusion
models.

problems to computer graphics. WoB is a grid-free Monte Carlo solver for
certain classes of second order partial differential equations. A similar Monte
Carlo solver, the walk-on-spheres (WoS) method, has been recently popularized
in computer graphics due to its advantages over traditional spatial
discretization-based alternatives. We show that WoB's intrinsic properties
yield further advantages beyond those of WoS. Unlike WoS, WoB naturally
supports various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and mixed) for
both interior and exterior domains. WoB builds upon boundary integral
formulations, and it is mathematically more similar to light transport
simulation in rendering than the random walk formulation of WoS. This
similarity between WoB and rendering allows us to implement WoB on top of Monte
Carlo ray tracing, and to incorporate advanced rendering techniques (e.g.,
bidirectional estimators with multiple importance sampling, the virtual point
lights method, and Markov chain Monte Carlo) into WoB. WoB does not suffer from
the intrinsic bias of WoS near the boundary and can estimate solutions
precisely on the boundary. Our numerical results highlight the advantages of
WoB over WoS as an attractive alternative to solve boundary value problems
based on Monte Carlo.

countless and diverse driving situations. Many manually designed driving
policies are difficult to scale to the real world. Fortunately, reinforcement
learning has shown great success in many tasks by automatic trial and error.
However, when it comes to autonomous driving in interactive dense traffic, RL
agents either fail to learn reasonable performance or necessitate a large
amount of data. Our insight is that when humans learn to drive, they will 1)
make decisions over the high-level skill space instead of the low-level control
space and 2) leverage expert prior knowledge rather than learning from scratch.
Inspired by this, we propose ASAP-RL, an efficient reinforcement learning
algorithm for autonomous driving that simultaneously leverages motion skills
and expert priors. We first parameterized motion skills, which are diverse
enough to cover various complex driving scenarios and situations. A skill
parameter inverse recovery method is proposed to convert expert demonstrations
from control space to skill space. A simple but effective double initialization
technique is proposed to leverage expert priors while bypassing the issue of
expert suboptimality and early performance degradation. We validate our
proposed method on interactive dense-traffic driving tasks given simple and
sparse rewards. Experimental results show that our method can lead to higher
learning efficiency and better driving performance relative to previous methods
that exploit skills and priors differently. Code is open-sourced to facilitate
further research.

mobility communication scenarios has received numerous attention lately.
Current state-of-the-art OTFS detectors mainly can be divided into two
categories; iterative and training-based deep neural network (DNN) detectors.
Many practical iterative detectors rely on minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)
denoiser to get the initial symbol estimates. However, their computational
complexity increases exponentially with the number of detected symbols.
Training-based DNN detectors typically suffer from dependency on the
availability of large computation resources and the fidelity of synthetic
datasets for the training phase, which are both costly. In this paper, we
propose an untrained DNN based on the deep image prior (DIP) and decoder
architecture, referred to as D-DIP that replaces the MMSE denoiser in the
iterative detector. DIP is a type of DNN that requires no training, which makes
it beneficial in OTFS detector design. Then we propose to combine the D-DIP
denoiser with the Bayesian parallel interference cancellation (BPIC) detector
to perform iterative symbol detection, referred to as D-DIP-BPIC. Our
simulation results show that the symbol error rate (SER) performance of the
proposed D-DIP-BPIC detector outperforms practical state-of-the-art detectors

Similar to deep-inelastic scattering, there are two distinct perturbative
scales in the threshold limit where the matching coefficient can be factorized
into a space-like jet function at scale $P^z|1-y|$ and a pair of heavy-light
Sudakov form factors at scale $P^z$. The matching formula allows us to derive a
full renormalization group resummation of large threshold logarithms, and the
result is consistent with the known calculation to the next-to-next to leading
order (NNLO). This paves the way for direct large-$x$ PDFs calculations in
lattice QCD. As by-products, we find that the space-like jet function is
related to a time-like version calculated previously through analytic
continuation, and the heavy-light Sudakov form factor, calculated here to NNLO,
is a universal object appearing as well in the large momentum expansion of
quasi transverse-momentum-dependent PDFs and quasi wave-function amplitudes.

structural distortion. We observe that many deep learning based models exhibit
exceptional performance on removing homogeneous haze, but they usually fail to
address the challenge of non-homogeneous dehazing. Two main factors account for
this situation. Firstly, due to the intricate and non uniform distribution of
dense haze, the recovery of structural and chromatic features with high
fidelity is challenging, particularly in regions with heavy haze. Secondly, the
existing small scale datasets for non-homogeneous dehazing are inadequate to
support reliable learning of feature mappings between hazy images and their
corresponding haze-free counterparts by convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based models. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a novel two
branch network that leverages 2D discrete wavelete transform (DWT), fast
Fourier convolution (FFC) residual block and a pretrained ConvNeXt model.
Specifically, in the DWT-FFC frequency branch, our model exploits DWT to
capture more high-frequency features. Moreover, by taking advantage of the
large receptive field provided by FFC residual blocks, our model is able to
effectively explore global contextual information and produce images with
better perceptual quality. In the prior knowledge branch, an ImageNet
pretrained ConvNeXt as opposed to Res2Net is adopted. This enables our model to
learn more supplementary information and acquire a stronger generalization
ability. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated via extensive experiments and ablation studies. The code is

this fact, we decouple the discretization of the Lie group convolution
elucidating two separate sampling instances: the filter and the signal. To
discretize the filters, we exploit the exponential map that links a Lie group

learned from the data determines a unique filter in $L^{1}(G)$, and we show how
this uniqueness of representation is defined by the bandwidth of the filter

current image editing methods use texts to achieve intuitive and versatile
modification of images. To edit a real image using diffusion models, one must
first invert the image to a noisy latent from which an edited image is sampled
with a target text prompt. However, most methods lack one of the following:
user-friendliness (e.g., additional masks or precise descriptions of the input
image are required), generalization to larger domains, or high fidelity to the
input image. In this paper, we design an accurate and quick inversion
technique, Prompt Tuning Inversion, for text-driven image editing.
Specifically, our proposed editing method consists of a reconstruction stage
and an editing stage. In the first stage, we encode the information of the
input image into a learnable conditional embedding via Prompt Tuning Inversion.
In the second stage, we apply classifier-free guidance to sample the edited
image, where the conditional embedding is calculated by linearly interpolating
between the target embedding and the optimized one obtained in the first stage.
This technique ensures a superior trade-off between editability and high
fidelity to the input image of our method. For example, we can change the color
of a specific object while preserving its original shape and background under
the guidance of only a target text prompt. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
demonstrate the superior editing performance of our method compared to the

past human motion trajectory. To address the problem, in this work we propose
FreqMRN, a human motion prediction framework that takes into account both the
kinematic structure of the human body and the temporal smoothness nature of
motion. Specifically, FreqMRN first generates a fixed-size motion history
summary using a motion attention module, which helps avoid inaccurate motion
predictions due to excessively long motion inputs. Then, supervised by the
proposed spatial-temporal-aware, velocity-aware and global-smoothness-aware
losses, FreqMRN iteratively refines the predicted motion though the proposed
motion refinement module, which converts motion representations back and forth
between pose space and frequency space. We evaluate FreqMRN on several standard
benchmark datasets, including Human3.6M, AMASS and 3DPW. Experimental results
demonstrate that FreqMRN outperforms previous methods by large margins for both
short-term and long-term predictions, while demonstrating superior robustness.

the robot successfully accomplishes three surgical sub-tasks: retraction

denoising diffusion model that can be used for real-world image denoising. We
introduce a diffusion process with linear interpolation, and the intermediate
noisy image is interpolated from the original clean image and the corresponding
real-world noisy image, so that this diffusion model can handle the level of
added noise. In particular, we also introduce two sampling algorithms for this
diffusion model. The first one is a simple sampling procedure defined according
to the diffusion process, and the second one targets the problem of the first
one and makes a number of improvements. Our experimental results show that our
proposed method with a simple CNNs Unet achieves comparable results compared to

(PTAs) suggests that the detection of nanohertz gravitational waves might be
around the corner. However, in order to confidently attribute this red process
to gravitational waves, one must observe the Hellings-Downs curve -- the
telltale angular correlation function associated with a gravitational-wave
background. This effort is complicated by the complex modelling of pulsar
noise. Without proper care, mis-specified noise models can lead to
false-positive detections. Background estimation using bootstrap methods such
as sky scrambles and phase shifts, which use the data to characterize the
noise, are therefore important tools for assessing significance. We investigate
the ability of current PTA experiments to estimate their background with
""quasi-independent"" scrambles -- characterized by a statistical ""match"" below
the fiducial value: $|M|<0.1$. We show that sky scrambling is affected by
""saturation"" after $O(10)$ quasi-independent realizations; subsequent scrambles
are no longer quasi-independent. We show phase scrambling saturates after
$O(100)$ quasi-independent realizations. With so few independent scrambles, it
is difficult to make reliable statements about the $\gtrsim 5 \sigma$ tail of
the null distribution of the detection statistic. We discuss various methods by

  Bridging the Gap between Training and Inference!",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion models have been successfully adapted to text generation tasks by
mapping the discrete text into the continuous space. However, there exist
nonnegligible gaps between training and inference, owing to the absence of the
forward process during inference. Thus, the model only predicts based on the
previously generated reverse noise rather than the noise computed by the
forward process. Besides, the widely-used downsampling strategy in speeding up
the inference will cause the mismatch of diffusion trajectories between
training and inference. To understand and mitigate the above two types of
training-inference discrepancies, we launch a thorough preliminary study. Based
on our observations, we propose two simple yet effective methods to bridge the
gaps mentioned above, named Distance Penalty and Adaptive Decay Sampling.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{6} generation tasks confirm the superiority of
our methods, which can achieve $100\times \rightarrow 200\times$ speedup with
better performance.

Generalized Universal Domain Adaptation (GUDA), which aims to achieve precise
prediction of all target labels including unknown categories. GUDA bridges the
gap between label distribution shift-based and label space mismatch-based
variants, essentially categorizing them as a unified problem, guiding to a
comprehensive framework for thoroughly solving all the variants. The key
challenge of GUDA is developing and identifying novel target categories while
estimating the target label distribution. To address this problem, we take
advantage of the powerful exploration capability of generative flow networks
and propose an active domain adaptation algorithm named GFlowDA, which selects
diverse samples with probabilities proportional to a reward function. To
enhance the exploration capability and effectively perceive the target label
distribution, we tailor the states and rewards, and introduce an efficient
solution for parent exploration and state transition. We also propose a
training paradigm for GUDA called Generalized Universal Adversarial Network
(GUAN), which involves collaborative optimization between GUAN and GFlowNet.
Theoretical analysis highlights the importance of exploration, and extensive

this paper, we introduce HACK (Head-And-neCK), a novel parametric model for
constructing the head and cervical region of digital humans. Our model seeks to
disentangle the full spectrum of neck and larynx motions, facial expressions,
and appearance variations, providing personalized and anatomically consistent
controls, particularly for the neck regions. To build our HACK model, we
acquire a comprehensive multi-modal dataset of the head and neck under various
facial expressions. We employ a 3D ultrasound imaging scheme to extract the
inner biomechanical structures, namely the precise 3D rotation information of
the seven vertebrae of the cervical spine. We then adopt a multi-view
photometric approach to capture the geometry and physically-based textures of
diverse subjects, who exhibit a diverse range of static expressions as well as
sequential head-and-neck movements. Using the multi-modal dataset, we train the
parametric HACK model by separating the 3D head and neck depiction into various
shape, pose, expression, and larynx blendshapes from the neutral expression and
the rest skeletal pose. We adopt an anatomically-consistent skeletal design for
the cervical region, and the expression is linked to facial action units for
artist-friendly controls. HACK addresses the head and neck as a unified entity,
offering more accurate and expressive controls, with a new level of realism,
particularly for the neck regions. This approach has significant benefits for
numerous applications and enables inter-correlation analysis between head and

dispersive ion-acoustic shock waves are formed for a large amplitude

through individual-group pluralism to WE pluralism, and presents a new policy

First, to evaluate policies involving diverse stakeholders, I develop from
individual subjectivity-objectivity to individual subjectivity and group
intersubjectivity, and then move to a narrow-wide WE pluralism in the gradation
of I-family-community-municipality-nation-world. Additionally, by referring to
some functional forms of well-being, I formulate the dependence of well-being
on narrow-wide WE. Finally, given that policies themselves have a plurality of
social, ecological, and economic values, I define a set of policies for each of
the narrow-wide WE and consider a mapping between the two to provide an
evaluation basis. Furthermore, by combining well-being and joint fact-finding
on the narrow-wide WE consensus, the policy evaluation method is formulated.

combined impact evaluation are disclosed as examples of implementation. This

paradigm for code search tasks. The paradigm involves pretraining the model on
search-irrelevant tasks such as masked language modeling, followed by the
finetuning stage, which focuses on the search-relevant task. The typical
finetuning method is to employ a dual-encoder architecture to encode semantic
embeddings of query and code separately, and then calculate their similarity
based on the embeddings.
  However, the typical dual-encoder architecture falls short in modeling
token-level interactions between query and code, which limits the model's
capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this
limitation, introducing a cross-encoder architecture for code search that
jointly encodes the semantic matching of query and code. We further introduce a
Retriever-Ranker (RR) framework that cascades the dual-encoder and
cross-encoder to promote the efficiency of evaluation and online serving.
Moreover, we present a probabilistic hard negative sampling method to improve
the cross-encoder's ability to distinguish hard negative codes, which further
enhances the cascade RR framework. Experiments on four datasets using three
code PLMs demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.

pressure acting on the neutral helium atoms in the heliosphere has always been
neglected, its effect has been considered insignificant compared to
gravitational force. The most advanced numerical models of ISN He take into
account more and more subtle effects, therefore it is important to check if the
effect of radiation pressure is still negligible. In this paper, we use the
most up-to-date version of the Warsaw Test Particle Model (WTPM) to calculate
the expected helium distribution in the heliosphere, and simulate the flux of
ISN He observed by the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) and in the future
by the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP). We compare results
calculated with and without radiation pressure during low and high solar
activity. The results show that in the analysis of IBEX-Lo observations the
radiation pressure acting on typical helium causes flux differences at a level
of 1-4% and is comparable to the observational errors. For the more sensitive
IMAP-Lo instrument, there are some regions in the considered observations
configurations where radiation pressure causes potentially statistically
significant changes in the calculated fluxes. The effect can be up to 9% for
the indirect beam and is likely to be higher than the estimated errors.
Therefore, we claim that in the future analysis of the IMAP-Lo observations
radiation pressure acting on ISN He should be considered.

prefer to exploit GAN-based frameworks to tackle this task due to the balance

and adaptability to long-tail distribution, failing to simultaneously retain
source identity and restore detail. We propose DiffBFR to introduce Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (DPM) for BFR to tackle the above problem, given its
superiority over GAN in aspects of avoiding training collapse and generating
long-tail distribution. DiffBFR utilizes a two-step design, that first restores
identity information from low-quality images and then enhances texture details
according to the distribution of real faces. This design is implemented with
two key components: 1) Identity Restoration Module (IRM) for preserving the
face details in results. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian random
distribution with LQ images as the condition during the reverse process, we
propose a novel truncated sampling method which starts from LQ images with part
noise added. We theoretically prove that this change shrinks the evidence lower
bound of DPM and then restores more original details. With theoretical proof,
two cascade conditional DPMs with different input sizes are introduced to
strengthen this sampling effect and reduce training difficulty in the
high-resolution image generated directly. 2) Texture Enhancement Module (TEM)
for polishing the texture of the image. Here an unconditional DPM, a LQ-free
model, is introduced to further force the restorations to appear realistic. We
theoretically proved that this unconditional DPM trained on pure HQ images
contributes to justifying the correct distribution of inference images output
from IRM in pixel-level space. Truncated sampling with fractional time step is
utilized to polish pixel-level textures while preserving identity information.

combs. We combined experiments and three-dimensional numerical simulations to
investigate the trade-off between wing weight and drag generation. In
experiments of bristled strips, a reduced physical model of the bristled wing,
we found that the elasto-viscous number indicates when reconfiguration occurs
in the bristles. Analysis of existing biological data suggested that bristled
wings of miniature insects lie below the reconfiguration threshold, thus
avoiding drag reduction. Numerical simulations of bristled strips showed that
there exist optimal numbers of bristles that maximize the weighted drag when
the additional volume due to the bristles is taken into account. We found a
scaling relationship between the rescaled optimal numbers and the dimensionless
bristle length. This result agrees qualitatively with and provides an upper
bound for the bristled wing morphological data analyzed in this study.

the correct option. Previous methods utilizing pretrained vision-language
models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performances, yet they show a lack of
multimodal context reasoning capability, especially for text-modal information.
To address this issue, we propose a Multi-modal Context Reasoning approach,
named ModCR. Compared to VLMs performing reasoning via cross modal semantic
alignment, it regards the given textual abstract semantic and objective image
information as the pre-context information and embeds them into the language
model to perform context reasoning. Different from recent vision-aided language
models used in natural language processing, ModCR incorporates the multi-view
semantic alignment information between language and vision by introducing the
learnable alignment prefix between image and text in the pretrained language
model. This makes the language model well-suitable for such multi-modal
reasoning scenario on joint textual and visual clues. We conduct extensive
experiments on two corresponding data sets and experimental results show
significantly improved performance (exact gain by 4.8% on PMR test set)

high algorithmic complexity or fail to minimize the reconfiguration overhead.
  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the ideas of
bipartition and Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) to reduce the overall reconfiguration
time. For the first time, we formulate the topology solving problem as a MCF
problem with piecewise-linear cost, which strikes a better balance between
solver complexity and solution optimality. Our evaluation shows that our
algorithm can significantly reduce the network convergence time while consuming
less topology solver running time, making its overall performance superior to
existing algorithms. Our code and test cases are available at a public
repository.

domain on top of pre-trained language models (PLMs), our empirical study
showcases the inconsistent gains from AT on some tasks, e.g. commonsense
reasoning, named entity recognition. This paper investigates AT from the
perspective of the contextualized language representation outputted by PLM
encoders. We find the current AT attacks lean to generate sub-optimal
adversarial examples that can fool the decoder part but have a minor effect on
the encoder. However, we find it necessary to effectively deviate the latter
one to allow AT to gain. Based on the observation, we propose simple yet
effective \textit{Contextualized representation-Adversarial Training} (CreAT),
in which the attack is explicitly optimized to deviate the contextualized
representation of the encoder. It allows a global optimization of adversarial
examples that can fool the entire model. We also find CreAT gives rise to a
better direction to optimize the adversarial examples, to let them less
sensitive to hyperparameters. Compared to AT, CreAT produces consistent
performance gains on a wider range of tasks and is proven to be more effective
for language pre-training where only the encoder part is kept for downstream

discrepancy can be attributed to a knowledge gap between radiologists and the

baseline models in terms of natural language generation metrics. Notably, our
model generates reports that are free from false references to non-existent

  Process","14 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Resetting is a strategy for boosting the speed of a target-searching process.
Since its introduction over a decade ago, most studies have been carried out
under the assumption that resetting takes place instantaneously. However, due
to its irreversible nature, resetting processes incur a thermodynamic cost,
which becomes infinite in case of instantaneous resetting. Here, we take into
consideration both the cost and first passage time (FPT) required for a
resetting process, in which the reset or return to the initial location is
implemented using a trapping potential over a finite but random time period. An
iterative generating function and counting functional method \`a la Feynman and
Kac are employed to calculate the FPT and average work for this process. From
these results, we obtain an explicit form of the time-cost trade-off relation,
which provides the lower bound of the mean FPT for a given work input when the
trapping potential is linear. This trade-off relation clearly shows that
instantaneous resetting is achievable only when an infinite amount of work is
provided. More surprisingly, the trade-off relation derived from the linear
potential seems to be valid for a wide range of trapping potentials. In
addition, we have also shown that the fixed-time or sharp resetting can further
enhance the trade-off relation compared to that of the stochastic resetting.

halos, showing that magnetic fields and relativistic electrons are mixed in
with the intra-cluster medium (ICM). There is general agreement that the origin
of radio halos is connected to turbulence, generated during cluster mergers.
Statistical studies of large samples of galaxy clusters in the radio band have
the potential to unveil the connection between the properties of radio halos
and the mass and dynamics of the host clusters. Previous studies have been
limited to massive clusters and based on a small number of radio halos. The aim
of this paper is to investigate the scaling relation between the radio power of
radio halos and the mass of the host clusters at low frequencies and down to
lower cluster masses. We analysed the clusters from the second catalogue of
Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich sources that lie within the 5634 sq deg covered by
the second Data Release of the LOFAR Two-meter Sky Survey. We derived the
correlation between the radio power and the mass of the host clusters and we
investigated the distribution of clusters without radio halos with respect to
the correlation. We use X-ray observations to classify the dynamical state of
clusters and investigate its role on the power of radio halos. We found a
correlation between the power of radio halos at 150 MHz and the mass of the
host clusters down to 3e14 Msun. This correlation has a large scatter, part of
which can be attributed to the different dynamical states of host clusters. We
used two statistical test to show that the distribution of clusters with and
without (upper limits) radio halos in the mass-radio power diagram is not
compatible with a single correlation and that it is also not compatible with
clusters being uniformly distributed below an upper envelope constituted by the
correlation.

of a singular (non-singular) linear systems in a faster way was introduced by
Nandi {\it et al.} [Numer. Algorithms; 84 (2) (2020) 457-483], recently. The
authors then provided its convergence criteria for a class of matrix splitting
called proper G-weak regular splittings of type I. In this note, we analyze
further the convergence criteria of the same scheme. In this aspect, we obtain
sufficient conditions for the convergence of the same scheme for another class
of matrix splittings called proper G-weak regular splittings of type II. We
then show that this scheme converges faster than the two-step alternating and
usual iteration schemes, even for this class of splittings. As a particular
case, we also establish faster convergence criteria of three-step in a
nonsingular matrix setting. This is shown that a large amount of computational
time and memory are required in single-step and two-step alternating iterative
methods to solve the nonsingular linear systems more efficiently than the
three-step alternating iteration method. Finally, the semiconvergence of a
three-step alternating iterative scheme is established. Its faster
semiconvergence is demonstrated by considering a singular linear system arising
from the Markov process.

reduced-order model to study the dispersion of urban air pollutants. The need
for real-time air quality monitoring has become increasingly important, given
the rise in pollutant emissions due to urbanization and its adverse effects on
human health. The proposed methodology involves solving the linear
advection-diffusion problem, where the solution of the Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes equations gives the convective field. At the same time, the
source term consists of an empirical time series. However, the computational
requirements of this approach, including microscale spatial resolution,
repeated evaluation, and low time scale, necessitate the use of
high-performance computing facilities, which can be a bottleneck for real-time
monitoring. To address this challenge, a problem-specific methodology was
developed that leverages a data-driven approach based on Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition with regression (POD-R) coupled with Galerkin projection (POD-G)
endorsed with the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). The proposed
method employs a feedforward neural network to non-intrusively retrieve the
reduced-order convective operator required for online evaluation. The numerical
framework was validated on synthetic emissions and real wind measurements. The
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the
computational burden of the traditional approach and is suitable for real-time

choose random points or make samples based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees
(RRT). Then, they decide on frontiers or Next Best Views (NBV) with useful
volumetric information. However, most state-of-the-art sampling-based
methodology is challenging to implement in two-dimensional robots due to the
lack of environmental knowledge, thus resulting in a bad volumetric gain for
evaluating random destinations. This study proposed an enhanced sampling-based

evaluates those with the enhanced utility function. The volumetric information

the methodology executed performed better in Gazebo platform-simulated

uncertainty with a proportional deviation. This allows network operators and
regulators to forecast the likely decision to be made by the household customer
to choose one heating technology that minimizes a cost function subject to
various constraints while ensuring robustness against the uncertainty in energy

requires a large number of statistical ensembles in comparison to the
infidelity scaling of O(1/N) for mixed states. One previous report optimized
the measurement basis in a photonic qubit system, whose state tomography uses
projective measurements, to obtain an infidelity scaling of O(1/N). However,
this dramatic improvement cannot be applied to weak-value-based measurement
systems in which two quantum states cannot be distinguished with perfect
measurement fidelity. We introduce in this work a new optimal measurement basis
to achieve fast adaptive quantum state tomography and a minimum magnitude of
infidelity in a weak measurement system. We expect that the adaptive quantum
state tomography protocol can lead to a reduction in the number of required

  Within the diquark-antidiquark model the masses of the $0^{++}, cc\bar c\bar
c$ resonances are calculated, using the expansion of the four-quark wave
function in the set of the hyperspherical functions. The interaction is defined
via a universal pair-wise potential, which does not contain fitting parameters.
The resulting masses $M_4(nS)$ are shown to be very sensitive to the value of
$c-$quark mass, chosen in relativistic string Hamiltonian, and $m_c=1.24, 1.30,
1.43$ (in GeV) are considered. The choice of $m_c$, equal to the current mass,
$m_c=1.245$ GeV, yields three $nS~(n_r=0,1,2)$ states in a very good agreement
with the masses of the $X(6550), X(6900), X(7287)$ resonances, if the
gluon-exchange interaction is totally neglected. This fact indicates on a
possible screening of the gluon-exchange interaction inhe $cc\bar c\bar c$
system. For $m_c=1.43$~GeV the ground state mass $M_4(1S)=6557$~MeV is obtained
in agreement with experiment only if $\alpha_{\rm V}\cong 0.39(1)$ is used,
however, in this case the masses of the $2S, 3S$ radial excitations exceed the

groups, and selected clusters, giving us a robust picture of their global
stellar and dynamical properties in particular locations in the Universe.
Intense study of these properties has revealed correlations between them,
including the well known universal stellar mass-metallicity relation. However,
since dwarfs play a role in a vast range of different environments, much can be
learned about galaxy formation and evolution through extending the study of
these objects to various locations. We present MUSE spectroscopy of a sample of
56 dwarf galaxies as a follow-up to the MATLAS survey in low-to-moderate
density environments beyond the Local Volume. The dwarfs have stellar masses in
the range of $M_{*}/M_{\odot}$ = 10$^{6.1}$-10$^{9.4}$ and show a distance
range of D = 14-148 Mpc, the majority (75%) of which are located in the range
targeted by the MATLAS survey (10-45 Mpc). We thus report a 75% (79% for dwarf
ellipticals) success rate for the semi-automatic identification of dwarf
galaxies in the MATLAS survey on the here presented subsample. Using pPXF full
spectrum fitting, we determine their line-of-sight velocity and can match the
majority of them with their massive host galaxy. Close inspection of their
spectra reveals that ~30% show clear emission lines and thus star formation
activity. We estimate their stellar population properties (age and metallicity)
and compare our results with other works investigating Local Volume and cluster
dwarf galaxies. We find that the dwarf galaxies presented in this work show a
systematic offset from the stellar mass-metallicity relation towards lower
metallicities at the same stellar mass. A similar deviation is present in other
works in the stellar mass range probed in this work and might be attributed to
the use of different methodologies for deriving the metallicity.

Building an accurate 3D map for indoor environment is challenging due to the

the accuracy, speed, and quality of 3D indoor mapping by fusing data from the
Inertial Measurement System (IMU) of the Intel Realsense D435i camera, the
Ultrasonic-based Indoor Positioning System (IPS), and the encoder of the

is processed using a Real-time Image Based Mapping algorithm (RTAB-Map), with
the processing frequency updated in synch with the position frequency of the

improves the accuracy, mapping time, and quality of 3D maps. Our study
highlights the proposed method's potential to improve indoor mapping in various
fields, indicating that the fusion of multiple data sources can be a valuable
tool in creating high-quality 3D indoor maps.

spectra to measure the equivalent width of the CaII triplet and then derive the
iron abundance. To test the validity of the adopted calibration in the
metal-rich regime, the procedure was first applied to three reference bulge
globular clusters (NGC 6569, NGC 6440, and NGC 6528). In all the three cases,
we found single-component iron distributions, with abundance values fully in
agreement with those reported in the literature. The application of the same
methodology to Liller 1 yielded, instead, a clear bimodal iron distribution,
with a sub-solar component at $\text{[Fe/H]}= -0.48\,$dex ($\sigma = 0.22$) and
a super-solar component at $\text{[Fe/H]}= +0.26\,$dex ($\sigma = 0.17$). The
latter is found to be significantly more centrally concentrated than the
metal-poor population, as expected in a self-enrichment scenario and in
agreement with what found in another bulge system, Terzan 5. The obtained
metallicity distribution is astonishingly similar to that predicted by the
reconstructed star formation history of Liller 1, which is characterized by
three main bursts and a low, but constant, activity of star formation over the
entire lifetime. These findings provide further support to the possibility
that, similar to Terzan 5, also Liller 1 is a Bulge Fossil Fragment.

case where one observes $N$ noisy measurements of each bee, and applied the
model to address the unordered nature of DNA storage systems. In such systems,
a unique address is typically prepended to each DNA data block to form a DNA
strand, but the address may possibly be corrupted. While clustering is usually
used to identify the address of a DNA strand, this requires $\mathcal{M}^2$
data comparisons (when $\mathcal{M}$ is the number of reads). In contrast, the
approach of Chrisnata et al. (2022) avoids data comparisons completely. In this
work, we study an intermediate, data-driven approach to this identification
task. For the binary erasure channel, we first show that we can almost surely
correctly identify all DNA strands under certain mild assumptions. Then we
propose a data-driven pruning procedure and demonstrate that on average the
procedure uses only a fraction of $\mathcal{M}^2$ data comparisons.
Specifically, for $\mathcal{M}= 2^n$ and erasure probability $p$, the expected

However, in the dense environment and higher frequencies, severe propagation

wideband processing. To this end, we propose equipping the transceivers with
the reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) that, different from RIS, is a

greater control of the radiation amplitude. This surface is crucial for
designing compact low-cost wideband wireless systems, wherein ultra-massive

given image was taken and is central to several 3D computer vision
applications. With the rapid growth in the popularity of AR/VR/MR devices and
cloud-based applications, privacy issues are becoming a very important aspect
of the localization process. Existing work on privacy-preserving localization
aims to defend against an attacker who has access to a cloud-based service. In
this paper, we show that an attacker can learn about details of a scene without
any access by simply querying a localization service. The attack is based on
the observation that modern visual localization algorithms are robust to
variations in appearance and geometry. While this is in general a desired
property, it also leads to algorithms localizing objects that are similar
enough to those present in a scene. An attacker can thus query a server with a
large enough set of images of objects, \eg, obtained from the Internet, and
some of them will be localized. The attacker can thus learn about object
placements from the camera poses returned by the service (which is the minimal
information returned by such a service). In this paper, we develop a
proof-of-concept version of this attack and demonstrate its practical
feasibility. The attack does not place any requirements on the localization
algorithm used, and thus also applies to privacy-preserving representations.
Current work on privacy-preserving representations alone is thus insufficient.

function (RDPF) for discrete memoryless sources subject to a single-letter
average distortion constraint and a perception constraint that belongs to the
family of f-divergences. For that, we leverage the fact that RDPF, assuming
mild regularity conditions on the perception constraint, forms a convex
programming problem. We first develop parametric characterizations of the
optimal solution and utilize them in an alternating minimization approach for
which we prove convergence guarantees. The resulting structure of the
iterations of the alternating minimization approach renders the implementation
of a generalized Blahut-Arimoto (BA) type of algorithm infeasible. To overcome
this difficulty, we propose a relaxed formulation of the structure of the
iterations in the alternating minimization approach, which allows for the
implementation of an approximate iterative scheme. This approximation is shown,
via the derivation of necessary and sufficient conditions, to guarantee
convergence to a globally optimal solution. We also provide sufficient
conditions on the distortion and the perception constraints which guarantee
that our algorithm converges exponentially fast. We corroborate our theoretical
results with numerical simulations, and we draw connections with existing
results.

H_2CN}$ radical, which has been recently detected for the first time in the
interstellar medium towards a handful of cold galactic sources, besides a warm
galaxy in front of the PKS 1830-211 quasar. These detections have shown that
the ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$ isomeric ratio, likewise the HCN/HNC ratio,
might increase with the kinetic temperature ($T_{\rm kin}$), but the shortage
of them in warm sources still prevents us to confirm this hypothesis and shed
light about their chemistry. In this work, we present the first detection of
${\rm H_2CN}$ and ${\rm H_2NC}$ towards a warm galactic source, the
G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud (with $T_{\rm kin} > 70 \, {\rm K}$), using IRAM
30m observations. We have detected multiple hyperfine components of the
$N_{K_\text{a}K_\text{c}} = 1_{01} - 0_{00}$ and $2_{02} - 1_{01}$ transitions.
We derived molecular abundances with respect to ${\rm H_2}$ of
(6.8$\pm$1.3)$\times 10^{-11}$ for ${\rm H_2CN}$ and of (3.1$\pm$0.7)$\times
10^{-11}$ for ${\rm H_2NC}$, and a ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$ abundance ratio
of 2.2$\pm$0.5. These detections confirm that the ${\rm H_2CN}$/${\rm H_2NC}$
ratio is $\gtrsim$2 for sources with $T_{\rm kin} > 70 \, {\rm K}$, larger than
the $\sim$1 ratios previously found in colder cores ($T_{\rm kin}\sim10 \, {\rm
K}$). This isomeric ratio dependence with temperature cannot be fully explained
with the currently proposed gas-phase formation and destruction pathways. Grain
surface reactions, including the ${\rm H_2NC} \rightarrow {\rm H_2CN}$
isomerization, deserve consideration to explain the higher isomeric ratios and
${\rm H_2CN}$ abundances observed in warm sources, where the molecules can be
desorbed into the gas phase through thermal and/or shock-induced mechanisms.

$g_{\rm{N}} < 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ from analyses of the dynamics of wide binary
stars selected from the Gaia DR3 database that have accurate distances, proper
motions, and reliably inferred stellar masses. Implicit high-order
multiplicities are required and the multiplicity fraction is calibrated so that
binary internal motions agree statistically with Newtonian dynamics at a high
enough acceleration of $10^{-8}$ m s$^{-2}$. The observed sky-projected motions
and separation are deprojected to the three-dimensional relative velocity $v$
and separation $r$ through a Monte Carlo method, and a statistical relation
between the Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm{N}} \equiv GM/r^2$ (where $M$ is the
total mass of the binary system) and a kinematic acceleration $g \equiv v^2/r$
is compared with the corresponding relation predicted by Newtonian dynamics.
The empirical acceleration relation at $< 10^{-9}$ m s$^{-2}$ systematically
deviates from the Newtonian expectation. A gravitational anomaly parameter
$\delta_{\rm{obs-newt}}$ between the observed acceleration at $g_{\rm{N}}$ and
the Newtonian prediction is measured to be: $\delta_{\rm{obs-newt}}= 0.034\pm
0.007$ and $0.109\pm 0.013$ at $g_{\rm{N}}\approx10^{-8.91}$ and $10^{-10.15}$
m s$^{-2}$, from the main sample of 26,615 wide binaries within 200 pc. These
two deviations in the same direction represent a $10\sigma$ significance. The
deviation represents a direct evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at
weak acceleration. At $g_{\rm{N}}=10^{-10.15}$ m s$^{-2}$, the observed to
Newton predicted acceleration ratio is
$g_{\rm{obs}}/g_{\rm{pred}}=10^{\sqrt{2}\delta_{\rm{obs-newt}}}=1.43\pm 0.06$.
This systematic deviation agrees with the boost factor that the AQUAL theory
predicts for kinematic accelerations in circular orbits under the Galactic
external field.

training of this vanilla strategy: classifier bias and representation bias,
which causes the previous knowledge that the model learned to be shaded. To
alleviate those biases, we propose a simple yet effective classifier

variance and the continuum variance, i.e., the Balmer decrement would be
smaller with larger continuum flux. Assuming that the dust obscuration leads to
the variance in the Balmer decrement and the continuum, an expected slope is
$-1/3$, which is not consistent with most of measured slopes. Using the
interpolated cross-correlation function, the time delays between the inverse

Software bloat occurs due to the ever increasing, mostly unused, features and
dependencies in a software. Bloat exists in all layers of software, from the
operating system, to the application, resulting in computing resource wastage.
The problem is exacerbated in both cloud and edge setting as the number of
applications running increase. To remove software bloat, multiple debloating
tools have been proposed in the literature. However, these tools do not provide
safety guarantees on the debloated software, with some files needed during
run-time removed. In this paper, We introduce BLAFS, a BLoat-Aware-file system

reduces container sizes by up to 97% of the original size, while maintaining
the safety of the containers when other debloating tools fail. We also evaluate
BLAFS's performance in edge settings. It can reduce the container provisioning
time by up to 90% providing comparable bandwidth reductions to lazy-loading
snap-shotters, while removing 97% of the vulnerabilities, and up to 97% less

epithelial-substrate coupling strength mediate the landscapes of the traction,
the cellular displacement, and the focal adhesion distribution in a cohesive

significantly affect the landscapes of the traction the cellular displacement,

outcome of a strong epithelial-substrate coupling without introducing any extra

promising, significant research gaps exist that impede the practical
implementation of 3D topological metamaterials. The 3D topological
metamaterials studied thus far are constrained to function in single frequency
bandwidths that are typically in a high-frequency regime, and a comprehensive

research gaps and advance the state of the art through the synthesis and
experimental realization of a 3D topological metamaterial that exploits
multimodal local resonance to enable low-frequency elastic wave control over
multiple distinct frequency bands. The proposed metamaterial is geometrically
configured to create multimodal local resonators whose frequency
characteristics govern the emergence of four unique low-frequency topological

employed to achieve polarization-, frequency-, and layer-dependent wave

of complete wave fields that unambiguously illustrate 2D topological waveguides

place when a Weyl semimetal is subjected to parallel electric and magnetic

the gravitational (also called the thermal chiral) anomaly an energy pumping
occurs within a pair of Weyl cones. As a result, this is expected to generate
anomalous heat current contributing to the thermal conductivity. We report an

Humans are proficient at utilizing environmental contacts to achieve

a novel method that combines graph search, optimal control, and a

which implicitly takes into account the exposed surface of the object and the
finger tip locations. Our method can efficiently discover hand and object
trajectories that are certified to be physically feasible by the simulation and
kinematically achievable by the dexterous hand. We evaluate our method on eight
challenging scenarios where nonprehensile pre-grasps are required to succeed.
We also show that our method can be applied to unseen objects different from
those in the training dataset. Finally, we report quantitative analyses on

  Prandtl equations",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address a physically-meaningful extension of the Prandtl system, also
known as hyperbolic Prandtl equations. We show that the linearised model around
a non-monotonic shear flow is ill-posed in any Sobolev spaces. Indeed, shortly
in time, we generate solutions that experience a dispersion relation of order
k^(1/3) in the frequencies of the tangential direction, akin the pioneering
result of Gerard-Varet and Dormy in [10] for Prandtl (where the dispersion was
of order k^(1/2)). We emphasise however that this growth rate does not imply
ill-posedness in Gevrey-class m, with m > 3 and we relate also these aspects to
the original Prandtl equations in Gevrey-class m, with m > 2. By relaxing
certain assumptions on the shear flow and on the solutions, namely allowing for
unbounded flows in the vertical direction, we however determine a suitable
shear flow for the mentioned ill-posedness in Gevrey spaces.

equally independently of their size. For neural networks, scale invariance is
typically achieved by data augmentation. However, when presented with a scale
far outside the range covered by the training set, neural networks may fail to
generalize.
  Here, we introduce the Riesz network, a novel scale invariant neural network.
Instead of standard 2d or 3d convolutions for combining spatial information,
the Riesz network is based on the Riesz transform which is a scale equivariant
operation. As a consequence, this network naturally generalizes to unseen or
even arbitrary scales in a single forward pass. As an application example, we
consider detecting and segmenting cracks in tomographic images of concrete. In
this context, 'scale' refers to the crack thickness which may vary strongly
even within the same sample. To prove its scale invariance, the Riesz network
is trained on one fixed crack width. We then validate its performance in
segmenting simulated and real tomographic images featuring a wide range of
crack widths. An additional experiment is carried out on the MNIST Large Scale

energy sources poses unprecedented challenges for the operation of distribution
grids. The high active power infeed of such sources during times of peak
production is a stress test which distribution grids have usually not been
exposed to in the past. When high amounts of active power are injected into the
grid, the overall power flow is often limited because of voltages reaching
their upper acceptable limits. Volt/VAr methods aim to raise this power flow
limit by controlling the voltage using reactive power. This way, more active
power can be transmitted safely without physically reinforcing the grid. In
this paper, we use real consumption and generation data on a low-voltage
CIGR\'E grid model and an experiment on a real distribution grid feeder to
analyze how different Volt/VAr methods can virtually reinforce the distribution
grid. We show that droop control and machine-learning-improved droop control
virtually reinforce the grid but do not utilize the reactive power resources to
their full extent. In contrast, methods which coordinate the usage of reactive
power resources across the grid, such as \ac{OFO}, can reinforce the grid to
its full potential. The simulation study performed on data of an entire year
suggests that Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) can enable another 9\% of
maximum active power injections. To achieve that, OFO only requires voltage
magnitude measurements, minimal model knowledge and communication with the
reactive power sources. A real-life experiment provides a demonstration of how
OFO acts at the level of a single device, and proves the practical feasibility
of the proposed approach.

first experimental verification and is considered as one of the most promising
candidates for future high-density on-chip solid state memory. However, the
lack of a fast and precise magnetic domain wall (DW) shifting mechanism and the
required extremely high DW motion (DWM) driving current both make the racetrack
difficult to commercialize. Here, we propose a method for coherent DWM that is
free from above issues, which is driven by chirality switching (CS) and an
ultralow spin-orbit-torque (SOT) current. The CS, as the driving force of DWM,
is achieved by the sign change of DM interaction which is further induced by a
ferroelectric switching voltage. The SOT is used to break the symmetry when the
magnetic moment is rotated to the Bloch direction. We numerically investigate
the underlying principle and the effect of key parameters on the DWM through
micromagnetic simulations. Under the CS mechanism, a fast (102 m/s), ultralow
energy (5 attojoule), and precisely discretized DWM can be achieved.
Considering that skyrmions with topological protection and smaller size are
also promising for future racetrack, we similarly evaluate the feasibility of
applying such a CS mechanism to a skyrmion. However, we find that the CS only
causes it to ""breathe"" instead of moving. Our results demonstrate that the CS
strategy is suitable for future DW racetrack memory with ultralow power
consumption and discretized DWM.

accurate simulation of massive MIMO in mmWave and THz bands. To address the
complexity/accuracy trade-off, a spatial channel model has been defined by 3GPP
(TR 38.901), which has been shown to be the main bottleneck of current
system-level simulations in ns-3. In this paper, we focus on improving the
channel modeling efficiency for large-scale MIMO system-level simulations.
Extensions are developed in two directions. First, we improve the efficiency of
the current 3GPP TR 38.901 implementation code in ns-3, by allowing the use of
the Eigen library for more efficient matrix algebra operations, among other
optimizations and a more modular code structure. Second, we propose a new
performance-oriented MIMO channel model for reduced complexity, as an
alternative model suitable for mmWave}/THz bands, and calibrate it against the
3GPP TR 38.901 model. Simulation results demonstrate the proper calibration of
the newly introduced model for various scenarios and channel conditions, and
exhibit an effective reduction of the simulation time (up to 16 times compared
to the previous baseline) thanks to the various proposed improvements.

masses by exploiting the Migdal effect, where a nuclear recoil leads to
electronic ionisation or excitation. In this work we combine these ideas to
study the sensitivity of a hydrogen-doped LZ experiment (HydroX), and a future
large-scale experiment such as XLZD. We find that HydroX could have sensitivity
to dark matter masses as low as 5~MeV for both spin-independent and
spin-dependent scattering, with XLZD extending that reach to lower cross
sections. Notably, this technique substantially enhances the sensitivity of
direct detection to spin-dependent proton scattering, well beyond the reach of

we propose anticipatory planning: an approach in which estimates of the

preparation and organization, reducing overall costs in long-lived planning
scenarios. We evaluate our method on blockworld environments and show that our

mitigate long-run biases through smart system design, we introduce techniques
for monitoring fairness in real time. Our goal is to build and deploy a monitor
that will continuously observe a long sequence of events generated by the
system in the wild, and will output, with each event, a verdict on how fair the
system is at the current point in time. The advantages of monitoring are
two-fold. Firstly, fairness is evaluated at run-time, which is important
because unfair behaviors may not be eliminated a priori, at design-time, due to
partial knowledge about the system and the environment, as well as
uncertainties and dynamic changes in the system and the environment, such as
the unpredictability of human behavior. Secondly, monitors are by design
oblivious to how the monitored system is constructed, which makes them suitable
to be used as trusted third-party fairness watchdogs. They function as
computationally lightweight statistical estimators, and their correctness
proofs rely on the rigorous analysis of the stochastic process that models the
assumptions about the underlying dynamics of the system. We show, both in
theory and experiments, how monitors can warn us (1) if a bank's credit policy
over time has created an unfair distribution of credit scores among the
population, and (2) if a resource allocator's allocation policy over time has
made unfair allocations. Our experiments demonstrate that the monitors
introduce very low overhead. We believe that runtime monitoring is an important
and mathematically rigorous new addition to the fairness toolbox.

crucial assumption that noise behaves in a predictable, time-local, or
so-called Markovian manner, whose breakdown can naturally become the leading
source of errors as quantum devices scale in size and depth. We analytically
show that error suppression techniques such as Dynamical Decoupling (DD) and
Randomized Compiling (RC) can operationally Markovianize RB: i) fast DD reduces
non-Markovian RB to an exponential decay plus longer-time corrections, while on

With the advent of more sophisticated ground-based detectors and space-based
observatories, it is anticipated that Gravitational Wave events will be
detected at a much higher rate in the near future. One of the future data
analysis challenges, is performing robust statistical inference in the presence
of detector noise transients or non-stationarities, as well as in the presence
of stochastic Gravitational Wave signals of possible astrophysical origin. The
incomplete knowledge of instrumental noise can introduce bias in parameter
estimation of detected sources. Here, we propose a heavier-tailed likelihood
filter based on the Generalized Hyperbolic distribution. With the Hyperbolic
likelihood we obtain a robust data analysis framework against data outliers,
noise non-stationarities, and possible inaccurate modeling of the noise power
spectral density. We apply this methodology to examples drawn from
gravitational wave astronomy, and in particular using synthetic data sets from
the planned LISA mission, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving
parameter estimation accuracy. Our findings suggest that the use of
heavier-tailed likelihoods can significantly improve the robustness of
statistical inference in Gravitational Wave Astronomy.

  Conditions for Geometry Processing","24 pages",,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many geometry processing techniques require the solution of partial
differential equations (PDEs) on surfaces. Such surface PDEs often involve
boundary conditions prescribed on the surface, at points or curves on its
interior or along the geometric (exterior) boundary of an open surface.
However, input surfaces can take many forms (e.g., meshes, parametric surfaces,
point clouds, level sets, neural implicits). One must therefore generate a mesh
to apply finite element-type techniques or derive specialized discretization
procedures for each surface representation.
  We propose instead to address such problems through a novel extension of the
closest point method (CPM) to handle interior boundary conditions specified at
surface points or curves. CPM solves the surface PDE by solving a volumetric
PDE defined over the Cartesian embedding space containing the surface; only a
closest point function is required to represent the surface. As such, CPM
supports surfaces that are open or closed, orientable or not, and of any
codimension or even mixed-codimension. To enable support for interior boundary
conditions, we develop a method to implicitly partition the embedding space
across interior boundaries. CPM's finite difference and interpolation stencils
are adapted to respect this partition while preserving second-order accuracy.
Furthermore, an efficient sparse-grid implementation and numerical solver is
developed that can scale to tens of millions of degrees of freedom, allowing
PDEs to be solved on more complex surfaces. We demonstrate our method's
convergence behaviour on selected model PDEs. Several geometry processing
problems are explored: diffusion curves on surfaces, geodesic distance, tangent
vector field design, and harmonic map construction. Our proposed approach thus
offers a powerful and flexible new tool for a range of geometry processing
tasks on general surface representations.

independently and identically distributed samples of $X$, where $X$ and $Z$ are
independent $D$-dimensional random variables with $X$ sub-Gaussian with bounded
second moment and $Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2I_D)$. Under the absolute-error
loss, the above problem has a parametric estimation rate of
$\frac{c^D}{\sqrt{n}}$, which is exponential in data dimension $D$ and often
problematic for applications. We overcome this exponential sample complexity by
projecting $X$ to a low-dimensional space via principal component analysis
(PCA) before the entropy estimation, and show that the asymptotic error
overhead vanishes as the unexplained variance of the PCA vanishes. This implies
near-optimal performance for inherently low-dimensional structures embedded in
high-dimensional spaces, including hidden-layer outputs of deep neural networks

objects in the scene are often occluded or lie outside the field of view of the
camera, rendering the camera observation ambiguous with regard to their

resolves inherent ambiguities in images, enabling keypoint tracking on
symmetrical objects and occluded and out-of-view objects. We employ our method

determining device performance for photovoltaic and photocatalytic
applications. However, current theoretical studies of charge transfer process
don't consider the effects of operating conditions such as illuminations and
yield systemically larger interlayer transfer time of hot electrons in MoS2/WS2
compared to experimental results. Here in this work, we propose a general
picture that, illumination can induce interfacial dipoles in type-II
heterostructures, which can accelerate hot carrier transfer by reducing the
energy difference between the electronic states in separate materials and
enhancing the nonadiabatic couplings. Using the first-principles calculations
and the ab-initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, we demonstrate this picture
using MoS2/WS2 as a prototype. The calculated characteristic time for the
interlayer transfer (60 fs) and the overall relaxation (700 fs) processes of
hot electrons is in good agreement with the experiments. We further find that
illumination mainly affects the ultrafast interlayer transfer process but has
little effects on the relatively slow intralayer relaxation process. Therefore,
the overall relaxation process of hot electrons has a saturated time with
increased illumination strengths. The illumination-accelerated charge transfer
is expected to universally exist in type-II heterostructures.

as they destroy trust and waste computational and human resources. Eradicating
flakiness in test suites is therefore an important goal, but automated
debugging tools are needed to support developers when trying to understand the
causes of flakiness. A popular example for an automated approach to support
regular debugging is spectrum-based fault localization (SFL), a technique that
identifies software components that are most likely the causes of failures.
While it is possible to also apply SFL for locating likely sources of flakiness
in code, unfortunately the flakiness makes SFL both imprecise and
non-deterministic. In this paper we introduce SFFL (Spectrum-based Flaky Fault
Localization), an extension of traditional coverage-based SFL that exploits our
observation that 80% of flaky tests exhibit varying coverage behavior between
different runs. By distinguishing between stable and flaky coverage, SFFL is
able to locate the sources of flakiness more precisely and keeps the
localization itself deterministic. An evaluation on 101 flaky tests taken from
48 open-source Python projects demonstrates that SFFL is effective: Of five
prominent SFL formulas, DStar, Ochiai, and Op2 yield the best overall
performance. On average, they are able to narrow down the fault's location to
3.5 % of the project's code base, which is 18.7 % better than traditional SFL
(for DStar). SFFL's effectiveness, however, depends on the root causes of
flakiness: The source of non-order-dependent flaky tests can be located far
more precisely than order-dependent faults.

Nonetheless, non-trivial performance of such smoothed classifier crucially

Confronted with this issue, many other devices in the MEC system can serve as
cooperative nodes to collect the tasks of these users and further forward them

continuously generate the tasks and offload the tasks to the BS through a

II). For both cases, the formulated optimization problems are nonconvex due to
fractional structure of the objective function and complicated variable

approach involves explicitly learning a model of the system dynamics and using
it to learn the optimal policy for continuous control over multiple timesteps.
As a result, MBRL agents may converge to sub-optimal policies if the world

egocentric LiDAR and RGB camera observations collected from the F1TENTH Gym.
The zero-shot performance of MBRL agents is empirically evaluated on unseen

universe. In this paper, we reconstruct the dark energy scalar field potential
$V(\phi)$ using the Hubble parameter H(z) through Gaussian Process analysis.
Our goal is to investigate dark energy using various H(z) datasets and priors.
We find that the choice of prior has little effect on the reconstructed
$V(\phi)$, but the choice of H(z) dataset has a significant impact. Our result
shows that Observational H(z) data (OHD) produces better results in
reconstructing $V(\phi)$ compared to cosmic chronometers (CC). Additionally, we
simulate H(z) data to measure the effect of increasing the number of data
points on the accuracy of reconstructed $V(\phi)$. We find that doubling the
number of H(z) data points can improve the accuracy rate of reconstructed
$V(\phi)$ by 5$\%$ to 30$\%$.

formation. Therefore, their abundances can unravel the recent star formation
history of the host galaxy. In view of future gamma-ray surveys, we predict the
masses and fluxes of these two elements in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC)
using new chemical evolution models. Our best model reproduces the abundance
patterns of alpha/Fe ratios, the gas mass, the average metallicity, the present
time supernova and nova rates observed in LMC. We show three main results: i)
the best model for the LMC suggests a star formation rate very mild at the
beginning with a recent burst, and a Salpeter-like initial mass function. ii)
The predicted mass of 26Al is 0.33 M_Sun, 2/3 produced by massive stars and 1/3
by novae. iii) The predicted mass of 60Fe is 0.44 M_Sun, entirely produced by
massive stars. This result suggests a larger fraction of 60Fe, at variance with
the Milky Way. The explanation for this lies in the adopted initial mass
function, that for the LMC contains more massive stars than for the Milky Way.
These predictions can be useful for the COSI-SMEX mission planned for launch in
2027. The expected gamma-ray line fluxes for the 1.809 MeV line of 26Al and the
1.173 and 1.332 MeV lines of 60Fe are in the range of (0.2-2.7)x10^-6 ph cm^-2
s^-1 and (0.7-2.8)x10^-7 ph cm^-2 s^-1, respectively. This new instrument could
have the sensitivity to detect the upper end of the predicted 1.8 MeV flux
within its nominal two-year mission.

scalar number that allows a natural ordering and is independent on a threshold,

good metric for anomaly detection, or if it gives a false sense of comfort, due
to relying on assumptions which are unlikely to hold in practice. Our
investigation shows that variations of AUC emphasizing accuracy at low false
positive rate seem to be better correlated with the needs of practitioners, but
also that we can compare anomaly detectors only in the case when we have
representative examples of anomalous samples. This last result is disturbing,
as it suggests that in many cases, we should do active or few-show learning

  Failure is Hard","To appear in the 28th International Workshop on Security Protocols",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper we're going to explore the ways in which security proofs can
fail, and their broader lessons for security engineering. To mention just one
example, Larry Paulson proved the security of SSL/TLS using his theorem prover
Isabelle in 1999, yet it's sprung multiple leaks since then, from timing
attacks to Heartbleed. We will go through a number of other examples in the
hope of elucidating general principles. Proofs can be irrelevant, they can be
opaque, they can be misleading and they can even be wrong. So we can look to
the philosophy of mathematics for illumination. But the problem is more
general. What happens, for example, when we have a choice between relying on
mathematics and on physics? The security proofs claimed for quantum
cryptosystems based on entanglement raise some pointed questions and may engage
the philosophy of physics. And then there's the other varieties of assurance;
we will recall the reliance placed on FIPS-140 evaluations, which API attacks
suggested may have been overblown. Where the defenders focus their assurance
effort on a subsystem or a model that cannot capture the whole attack surface
they may just tell the attacker where to focus their effort. However, we think
it's deeper and broader than that. The models of proof and assurance on which
we try to rely have a social aspect, which we can try to understand from other
perspectives ranging from the philosophy or sociology of science to the
psychology of shared attention. These perspectives suggest, in various ways,
how the management of errors and exceptions may be particularly poor. They do
not merely relate to failure modes that the designers failed to consider
properly or at all; they also relate to failure modes that the designers (or
perhaps the verifiers) did not want to consider for institutional and cultural
reasons.

to address single magnetic impurities on superconducting surfaces and to
investigate the peculiar properties of the in-gap states known as
Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states. However, until very recently YSR states were
only investigated with conventional tunneling spectroscopy, missing the crucial
information contained in other transport properties such as shot noise. Here,
we adapt the concept of full counting statistics (FCS) to provide a very deep
insight into the spin-dependent transport in these hybrid systems. We
illustrate the power of FCS by analyzing different situations in which YSR
states show up including single-impurity junctions, as well as double-impurity
systems where one can probe the tunneling between individual YSR states. The
FCS concept allows us to unambiguously identify every tunneling process that
plays a role in these situations. Moreover, FCS provides all the relevant
transport properties, including current, shot noise and all the cumulants of
the current distribution. Our approach can reproduce the experimental results
recently reported on the shot noise of a single-impurity junction with a normal
STM tip. We also predict the signatures of resonant (and non-resonant) multiple
Andreev reflections in the shot noise of single-impurity junctions with two
superconducting electrodes. In the case of double-impurity junctions we show
that the direct tunneling between YSR states is characterized by a strong
reduction of the Fano factor that reaches a minimum value of 7/32, a new
fundamental result in quantum transport. The FCS approach presented here can be
naturally extended to investigate the spin-dependent superconducting transport
in a variety of situations, and it is also suitable to analyze multi-terminal
superconducting junctions, irradiated contacts, and many other basic
situations.

  in the presence of matter effects",,,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Binary neutron stars (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are
one of the most promising gravitational wave (GW) sources to probe matter
effects. Upcoming observing runs of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors and future third
generation detectors like Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will allow the
extraction of detailed information on these matter effects from the GW
signature of BNS and NSBH systems. One subtle effect which may be helpful to
extract more information from the detection of compact binary systems is the
non-linear memory. In this work, we investigate the observational consequences
of gravitational wave non-linear memory in the presence of matter effects.
  We start by quantifying the impact of non-linear memory on distinguishing BNS
mergers from binary black holes (BBH) or NSBH mergers. We find that for the
third generation detectors, the addition of non-linear memory to the GW signal
model expands the parameter space where BNS signals become distinguishable from
the BBH and NSBH signals. Using numerical relativity simulations, we also study
the non-linear memory generated from the post-merger phase of BNS systems. We
find that it does not show a strong dependence on the equation of state of the
NS. However, the non-linear memory from the BNS post-merger phase is much lower
than the one from BBH systems of the same masses. Furthermore, we compute the
detection prospects of non-linear memory from the post-merger phase of NS
systems by accumulating signal strength from a population of BNS mergers for
the current and future detectors. Finally, we discuss the impact of possible
linear memory from the dynamical ejecta of BNS and NSBH systems and its signal

  Propagation","13 Figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Texture mapping as a fundamental task in 3D modeling has been well
established for well-acquired aerial assets under consistent illumination, yet
it remains a challenge when it is scaled to large datasets with images under
varying views and illuminations. A well-performed texture mapping algorithm
must be able to efficiently select views, fuse and map textures from these
views to mesh models, at the same time, achieve consistent radiometry over the
entire model. Existing approaches achieve efficiency either by limiting the
number of images to one view per face, or simplifying global inferences to only
achieve local color consistency. In this paper, we break this tie by proposing
a novel and efficient texture mapping framework that allows the use of multiple
views of texture per face, at the same time to achieve global color
consistency. The proposed method leverages a loopy belief propagation algorithm
to perform an efficient and global-level probabilistic inferences to rank
candidate views per face, which enables face-level multi-view texture fusion
and blending. The texture fusion algorithm, being non-parametric, brings
another advantage over typical parametric post color correction methods, due to
its improved robustness to non-linear illumination differences. The experiments
on three different types of datasets (i.e. satellite dataset, unmanned-aerial
vehicle dataset and close-range dataset) show that the proposed method has
produced visually pleasant and texturally consistent results in all scenarios,
with an added advantage of consuming less running time as compared to the state
of the art methods, especially for large-scale dataset such as
satellite-derived models.

applications. Selecting an appropriate channel combination from the original
multichannel image can improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation and reduce
the cost of data storage, processing and future acquisition. Existing channel
selection methods typically use a reasonable selection procedure to determine a
desirable channel combination, and then train a semantic segmentation network
using that combination. In this study, the concept of pruning from a supernet
is used for the first time to integrate the selection of channel combination
and the training of a semantic segmentation network. Based on this concept, a
One-Shot Task-Adaptive (OSTA) channel selection method is proposed for the
semantic segmentation of multichannel images. OSTA has three stages, namely the
supernet training stage, the pruning stage and the fine-tuning stage. The
outcomes of six groups of experiments (L7Irish3C, L7Irish2C, L8Biome3C,
L8Biome2C, RIT-18 and Semantic3D) demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency
of OSTA. OSTA achieved the highest segmentation accuracies in all tests (62.49%

tested. All of this can be accomplished within a predictable and relatively
efficient timeframe, ranging from 101.71% to 298.1% times the time required to
train the segmentation network alone. In addition, there were interesting

function $f:V(H)\to V(G)$ that preserves colors and edges. Many interesting
counting problems (e.g., subgraph and induced subgraph counts) are finite
linear combinations $p(\cdot)=\sum_{H}\alpha_{H}\hom(H,\cdot)$ of homomorphism
counts, and such linear combinations are known to be hard to evaluate iff they
contain a large-treewidth graph $S$. The hardness can be shown in two steps:
First, the problems $\hom(S,\cdot)$ for colorful (i.e., bijectively colored)
large-treewidth graphs $S$ are shown to be hard. In a second step, these
problems are reduced to finite linear combinations of homomorphism counts that
contain the uncolored version $S^{\circ}$ of $S$. This step can be performed
via inclusion-exclusion in $2^{|E(S)|}\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$ time, where $n$ is
the size of the input graph and $s$ is the maximum number of vertices among all
graphs in the linear combination.
  We show that the second step can be performed even in time
$4^{\Delta(S)}\mathrm{poly}(n,s)$, where $\Delta(S)$ is the maximum degree of
$S$. Our reduction is based on graph products with Cai-F\""urer-Immerman graphs,
a novel technique that is likely of independent interest. For colorful graphs
$S$ of constant maximum degree, this technique yields a polynomial-time
reduction from $\hom(S,\cdot)$ to linear combinations of homomorphism counts
involving $S^{\circ}$. Under certain conditions, it actually suffices that a
supergraph $T$ of $S^{\circ}$ is contained in the target linear combination.
  The new reduction yields $\mathsf{\#P}$-hardness results for several counting
problems that could previously be studied only under parameterized complexity
assumptions. This includes the problems of counting, on input a graph from a

which are still largely unexplored. Here we study manifestations of DQC when
driving (quantum annealing) a two-dimensional quantum magnet through a critical
point separating antiferromagnetic and spontaneously dimerized ground states.
Numerical simulations show that the celebrated Kibble-Zurek scaling (KZS)
mechanism is inadequate for describing the annealing process. To explain our
results, we introduce the concept of dual asymmetric KZS, where a deconfinement
time enters in addition to the conventional relaxation time and the scaling
also depends on the direction in which the system is driven through the
critical point according to a duality principle connecting the topological
defects in the two phases. These defects -- spinons in the dimerized phase and
space-time hedgehogs in the antiferromagnetic phase -- require a much longer
time scale for equilibration than the amplitude of the order parameter. Beyond
the new insights into DQC, our scaling approach provides a new window into
out-of-equilibrium criticality with multiple length and time scales.

optimization algorithms with guaranteed convergence, even when the CNN module
is not constrained as a contraction. Current PnP methods, which do not often
have well-defined energy formulations, require a contraction constraint that
restricts their performance in challenging applications. The energy and the
corresponding score function are learned from reference data using denoising
score matching, where the noise variance serves as a smoothness parameter that
controls the shape of the learned energy function. We introduce a multi-scale
optimization strategy, where a sequence of smooth approximations of the true
prior is used in the optimization process. This approach improves the
convergence of the algorithm to the global minimum, which translates to
improved performance. The preliminary results in the context of MRI show that
the multi-scale energy PnP framework offers comparable performance to unrolled
algorithms. Unlike unrolled methods, the proposed PnP approach can work with
arbitrary forward models, making it an easier option for clinical deployment.

  molecular excited states",,,,,"quant-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent developments of quantum computing present potential novel pathways
for quantum chemistry, as the increased computational power of quantum
computers could be harnessed to naturally encode and solve electronic structure
problems. Theoretically exact quantum algorithms for chemistry have been
proposed (e.g. Quantum Phase Estimation) but the limited capabilities of
current noisy intermediate scale quantum devices (NISQ) motivated the
development of less demanding hybrid algorithms. In this context, the
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm was successfully introduced as
an effective method to compute the ground state energy of small molecules. The
current study investigates the Folded Spectrum (FS) method as an extension to
the VQE algorithm for the computation of molecular excited states. It provides
the possibility of directly computing excited states around a selected target
energy, using the same ansatz as for the ground state calculation. Inspired by
the variance-based methods from the Quantum Monte Carlo literature, the FS
method minimizes the energy variance, thus requiring a computationally
expensive squared Hamiltonian. We alleviate this potentially poor scaling by
employing a Pauli grouping procedure, identifying sets of commuting Pauli
strings that can be evaluated simultaneously. This allows for a significant
reduction of the computational cost. We apply the FS-VQE method to small
molecules (H$_2$,LiH), obtaining all electronic excited states with chemical
accuracy on ideal quantum simulators.

We invested significant efforts in controlling and minimising the systematic
uncertainties of the cross-calibration bias below 1%. The statistical
uncertainties are similar and thus we can reliably measure effects at 1% level.
The effective area cross-calibration in the 0.5-6.1 keV band between MOS and pn
is biased at a substantial level. The MOS/pn bias is systematic suggesting that
MOS (pn) effective area may be calibrated too low (high), by $\sim$3-27% on
average depending on the instrument and energy band. The excellent agreement of
the energy dependencies (i.e. shapes) of the effective area of MOS2 and pn
suggest that they are correctly calibrated within $\sim$1% in the 0.5-4.5 keV
band. Comparison with an independent data set of point sources (3XMM) confirms
this. The cluster sample indicates that the MOS1/pn effective area shape
cross-calibration has an approximately linear bias amounting to $\sim$10% in
maximum in the 0.5-4.5 keV band. The effective area cross-calibration of
XMM-Newton/EPIC instruments on November 2021 in the 0.5-4.5 keV band is in a
relatively good shape. However, the cluster-to-cluster rms scatter of the bias
is substantial compared to the median bias itself. Thus, a statistically robust
implementation of the cross-calibration uncertainties to a scientific analysis
of XMM-Newton/EPIC data should include the propagation of the scatter to the
best-fit parameters, instead of a simple average bias correction of the
effective area.

disutility functions. Two well-studied fairness notions for indivisible items
are envy-freeness up to one/any item (EF1/EFX) and the standard notion of
economic efficiency is Pareto optimality (PO). There is a noticeable gap
between the results known for both EF1 and EFX in the goods and chores
settings. The case of chores turns out to be much more challenging. We reduce
this gap by providing slightly relaxed versions of the known results on goods
for the chores setting. Interestingly, our algorithms run in polynomial time,
unlike their analogous versions in the goods setting.
  We introduce the concept of $k$ surplus which means that up to $k$ more
chores are allocated to the agents and each of them is a copy of an original
chore. We present a polynomial-time algorithm which gives EF1 and PO
allocations with $(n-1)$ surplus.
  We relax the notion of EFX slightly and define tEFX which requires that the
envy from agent $i$ to agent $j$ is removed upon the transfer of any chore from
the $i$'s bundle to $j$'s bundle. We give a polynomial-time algorithm that in
the chores case for $3$ agents returns an allocation which is either
proportional or tEFX. Note that proportionality is a very strong criterion in
the case of indivisible items, and hence both notions we guarantee are
desirable.

this way, patch-level supervision can be applied to force the network to learn
sharp appearance details on the basis of geometry estimation. Overall, our

mitigations against them has therefore become an important focus of software
engineering research. To conduct sound investigations on test flakiness, it is
crucial to have large, diverse, and unbiased datasets of flaky tests. A common
method to build such datasets is by rerunning the test suites of selected
projects multiple times and checking for tests that produce different outcomes.
While using this technique on a single project is mostly straightforward,
applying it to a large and diverse set of projects raises several
implementation challenges such as (1) isolating the test executions, (2)
supporting multiple build mechanisms, (3) achieving feasible run times on large
datasets, and (4) analyzing and presenting the test outcomes. To address these
challenges we introduce FlaPy, a framework for researchers to mine flaky tests
in a given or automatically sampled set of Python projects by rerunning their
test suites. FlaPy isolates the test executions using containerization and
fresh execution environments to simulate real-world CI conditions and to
achieve accurate results. By supporting multiple dependency installation
strategies, it promotes diversity among the studied projects. FlaPy supports
parallelizing the test executions using SLURM, making it feasible to scan
thousands of projects for test flakiness. Finally, FlaPy analyzes the test
outcomes to determine which tests are flaky and depicts the results in a
concise table. A demo video of FlaPy is available at

formed by strong backflows at an early phase. We find that these threads advect

The main question of interest to the current paper is: when is a random
algebraic graph statistically and/or computationally distinguishable from

on the case $G =\{\pm1\}^d$ and use Fourier-analytic tools. For hard threshold

$1/(r\sqrt{d})$-Lipschitz connections we extend the results of [LR21b] when $d

as indicators of interval unions and low-degree polynomials. 2) Algebraic. We
provide evidence for an exponential statistical-computational gap. Consider any
finite group $G$ and let $A\subseteq G$ be a set of elements formed by

$1/2.$ Let $\Gamma_n(G,A)$ be the distribution of random graphs formed by

Yes or No depending on if the real number ought to be considered to be in the
given interval. Since the goal is to define the real numbers, this can only
motivate the definition of which rules should be considered a real number. The
rule must satisfy five properties and any rule that does so we call an oracle.
Three of the properties ensure that we do not have multiple oracles
representing the same real number. The other two properties ensure that the
oracle does narrow down to a single real number. The most important property is
the Separating property which ensures that if we divide a Yes interval into two
parts, then one part is a Yes interval while the other is a No interval; the
exception is if the division point, which is a rational number, happens to be
the desired real number in which case both intervals are Yes intervals. We
explore various examples and algorithms in using oracles in addition to
establishing that the oracles do, in fact, form the field of real numbers. The
concept of a Family of Overlapping, Notionally Shrinking Intervals is defined
and found to be an essential tool in working with oracle arithmetic. Mediant
approximations, which are related to continued fraction representations,
naturally arise from an oracle perspective. We also compare and contrast with
other common definitions of real numbers, such as Cauchy sequences and Dedekind
cuts, in which the conclusion is that the oracle perspective is somewhat of a
master map to the other definitions. We do an explicit example to contrast
oracle arithmetic with decimal arithmetic and continued fraction arithmetic.

and discriminative facial features (representations) from images, and storing
the facial features for real-time recognition. However, such features can still
be exploited to recover the appearance of the original face by building a
reconstruction network. Although several privacy-preserving methods have been
proposed, the enhancement of face privacy protection is at the expense of
accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose an adversarial features-based
face privacy protection (AdvFace) approach to generate privacy-preserving
adversarial features, which can disrupt the mapping from adversarial features
to facial images to defend against reconstruction attacks. To this end, we
design a shadow model which simulates the attackers' behavior to capture the
mapping function from facial features to images and generate adversarial latent
noise to disrupt the mapping. The adversarial features rather than the original
features are stored in the server's database to prevent leaked features from
exposing facial information. Moreover, the AdvFace requires no changes to the
face recognition network and can be implemented as a privacy-enhancing plugin
in deployed face recognition systems. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that AdvFace outperforms the state-of-the-art face
privacy-preserving methods in defending against reconstruction attacks while

  Allocation for mmWave Networks",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop a deep learning (DL)-guided hybrid beam and power
allocation approach for multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, which
facilitates swift beamforming at the base station (BS). The following
persisting challenges motivated our research: (i) User and vehicular mobility,
as well as redundant beam-reselections in mmWave networks, degrade the
efficiency; (ii) Due to the large beamforming dimension at the BS, the
beamforming weights predicted by the cutting-edge DL-based methods often do not
suit the channel distributions; (iii) Co-located user devices may cause a
severe beam conflict, thus deteriorating system performance. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we exploit the synergy of supervised learning and
super-resolution technology to enable low-overhead beam- and power allocation.
In the first step, we propose a method for beam-quality prediction. It is based
on deep learning and explores the relationship between high- and low-resolution
beam images (energy). Afterward, we develop a DL-based allocation approach,
which enables high-accuracy beam and power allocation with only a portion of
the available time-sequential low-resolution images. Theoretical and numerical
results verify the effectiveness of our proposed

  Updated the affiliation information of one of the authors and fixed
  formatting for the citations",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This work addresses how to validate group fairness in image recognition
software. We propose a distribution-aware fairness testing approach (called
DistroFair) that systematically exposes class-level fairness violations in
image classifiers via a synergistic combination of out-of-distribution (OOD)
testing and semantic-preserving image mutation. DistroFair automatically learns
the distribution (e.g., number/orientation) of objects in a set of images. Then
it systematically mutates objects in the images to become OOD using three
semantic-preserving image mutations -- object deletion, object insertion and
object rotation. We evaluate DistroFair using two well-known datasets
(CityScapes and MS-COCO) and three major, commercial image recognition software
(namely, Amazon Rekognition, Google Cloud Vision and Azure Computer Vision).
Results show that about 21% of images generated by DistroFair reveal
class-level fairness violations using either ground truth or metamorphic
oracles. DistroFair is up to 2.3x more effective than two main baselines, i.e.,
(a) an approach which focuses on generating images only within the distribution
(ID) and (b) fairness analysis using only the original image dataset. We
further observed that DistroFair is efficient, it generates 460 images per
hour, on average. Finally, we evaluate the semantic validity of our approach
via a user study with 81 participants, using 30 real images and 30
corresponding mutated images generated by DistroFair. We found that images
generated by DistroFair are 80% as realistic as real-world images.

  Engineered Applications",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There are many philosophies and theories on what creativity is and how it
works, but one popular idea is that of variations on a theme and intersection
of concepts. This literature review explores philosophical proposals of how
creativity emerges from variations on a theme, and how formalizations of these
proposals in human subject studies and computational methods result in
creativity. Specifically, the philosophical idea of intangible clouds of
concepts is analyzed with empirical studies of concept representation and
mental model formation, and mathematical formalizations of such ideas.
Empirical findings on emergent neural activity from neural network combinations
are also examined for evidence of novel, emergent ideas from the collision of
existing ones. Finally, work on human-AI co-creativity is used as a lens for
concept collision and the effectiveness of this model of creativity. This paper
also proposes directions for further research in studying creativity as
variations on a theme.

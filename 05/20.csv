points which describe the best possible trade-offs between the multiple
objectives. In order to solve this vector-valued optimization problem,
practitioners often appeal to the use of scalarization functions in order to
transform the multi-objective problem into a collection of single-objective
problems. This set of scalarized problems can then be solved using traditional
single-objective optimization techniques. In this work, we formalise this
convention into a general mathematical framework. We show how this strategy
effectively recasts the original multi-objective optimization problem into a
single-objective optimization problem defined over sets. An appropriate class
of objective functions for this new problem is the R2 utility function, which
is defined as a weighted integral over the scalarized optimization problems. We
show that this utility function is a monotone and submodular set function,
which can be optimised effectively using greedy optimization algorithms. We
analyse the performance of these greedy algorithms both theoretically and
empirically. Our analysis largely focusses on Bayesian optimization, which is a
popular probabilistic framework for black-box optimization.

topologically stable cosmic strings with a string tension $\mu \sim

to the appearance of domain walls bounded by the strings produced earlier. We
display the gravitational wave spectrum for $G \mu$ values varying between

However, existing format-inference techniques often miss many formats, because
almost all of them are in a fashion of dynamic analysis and rely on a limited
number of network packets to drive their analysis. If a feature is not present
in the input packets, the feature will be missed in the resulting formats. We
develop a novel static program analysis for format inference. It is well-known
that static analysis does not rely on any input packets and can achieve high
coverage by scanning every piece of code. However, for efficiency and
precision, we have to address two challenges, namely path explosion and
disordered path constraints. To this end, our approach uses abstract
interpretation to produce a novel data structure called the abstract format
graph. It delimits precise but costly operations to only small regions, thus
ensuring precision and efficiency at the same time. Our inferred formats are of
high coverage and precisely specify both field boundaries and semantic
constraints among packet fields. Our evaluation shows that we can infer formats
for a protocol in one minute with >95% precision and recall, much better than
four baseline techniques. Our inferred formats can substantially enhance

hydrodynamical simulations. Accretion is classically prescribed by an alpha
parameter which characterizes the turbulent radial transport of angular
momentum (AM) in the disk. This accretion scenario has been questioned for a
few years and an alternative paradigm has been proposed that involves the
vertical transport of AM by MHD winds. We revisit planet-disk interaction in
such context, with a focus on the planet's ability to open a gap and produce
meridional flows. Accretion, magnetic field and wind torque in the gap are also
explored, as well as the gravitational torque exerted by the disk onto the
planet. We carry out high-resolution 3D global non-ideal MHD simulations of a
gaseous disk threaded by a large-scale vertical magnetic field harboring a
planet in a fixed circular orbit using the GPU-accelerated code Idefix. We
consider various planet masses and disk magnetizations. We find that
gap-opening always occurs for sufficiently massive planets, with deeper gaps
when the planet mass increases and when the initial magnetization decreases. We
propose a gap opening criterion when accretion is dominated by MHD winds. We
show that accretion is unsteady and comes from surface layers in the outer
disk, bringing material directly towards the planet poles. A planet gap is a
privileged region for magnetic field accumulation, leading to nearly sonic
accretion stream through the gap. For massive planets, the wind torque induces
an asymmetric gap, both in depth and in width, that gradually erodes the outer
gap edge, reducing the outer Lindblad torque and potentially reversing the
migration direction of Jovian planets in magnetized disks after a few hundreds
of orbits. For low-mass planets, we find strongly fluctuating gravitational
torques that are mostly positive on average, indicating a stochastic outward
migration.

descent (GD) often operates at the edge of stability (EoS) [Cohen, et al.,

losses induced by the GD iterates. This paper studies the convergence and
implicit bias of constant-stepsize GD for logistic regression on linearly
separable data in the EoS regime. Despite the presence of local oscillations,
we prove that the logistic loss can be minimized by GD with any constant
stepsize over a long time scale. Furthermore, we prove that with any constant
stepsize, the GD iterates tend to infinity when projected to a max-margin
direction (the hard-margin SVM direction) and converge to a fixed vector that
minimizes a strongly convex potential when projected to the orthogonal
complement of the max-margin direction. In contrast, we also show that in the
EoS regime, GD iterates may diverge catastrophically under the exponential
loss, highlighting the superiority of the logistic loss. These theoretical
findings are in line with numerical simulations and complement existing
theories on the convergence and implicit bias of GD, which are only applicable
when the stepsizes are sufficiently small.

While traditional forms of optomechanical cooling utilize systems comprised of

Through Brillouin-mediated phonon-photon interactions, cooling of a band of
traveling acoustic waves can occur when anti-Stokes scattered photons exit the
system more rapidly than the relaxation rate of the mechanical waves -- to a
degree determined by the acousto-optic coupling. Here, we demonstrate that a
continuum of traveling wave phonons can be cooled within an optical fiber,
extending this physics to macroscopic length scales. Leveraging the large
acousto-optic coupling permitted within a liquid-core optical fiber, heterodyne

Quantifying the nonstabilizerness and relating it to other quantum resources is
vital for characterizing the complexity of quantum many-body systems. In this
work, we prove that a quantum state is a stabilizer if and only if all states
belonging to its Clifford orbit have a flat probability distribution on the
computational basis. This implies, in particular, that multifractal states are
magic. We introduce multifractal flatness, a measure based on the participation
entropy that quantifies the wave function distribution flatness. We demonstrate
that this quantity is analytically related to the stabilizer entropy of the

multifractality and nonstabilizerness. In particular, we show that the
multifractal flatness provides an experimentally and computationally viable
nonstabilizerness certification. Our work unravels a direct relation between

can fail to be equilibrium as long as it is not the only Gibbs state. For every
temperature below the uniqueness threshold there exists a sofic approximation
which gives this state finite but non-maximal pressure, and below half the
uniqueness threshold the pressure is non-maximal over every sofic

  We also show that the local limit of Gibbs states over a sofic approximation
$\Sigma$, if it exists, is a mixture of $\Sigma$-equilibrium states, and use
this to show that the plus- and minus-boundary-condition Ising states are

major galaxy mergers gravitationally funneling gas towards the galactic center,
with evidence both for and against this scenario. However, several recent
studies have found that radio-loud AGN overwhelmingly reside in ongoing or
recent major galaxy mergers. In this study, we test the hypothesis that major
galaxy mergers are important triggers for radio-loud AGN activity in powerful
quasars during cosmic noon (1 < z < 2). To this end, we compare Hubble Space
Telescope WFC3/IR observations of the z > 1 3CR radio-loud broad-lined quasars
to three matched radio-quiet quasar control samples. We find strong evidence
for major-merger activity in nearly all radio-loud AGN, in contrast to the much
lower merger fraction in the radio-quiet AGN. These results suggest major
galaxy mergers are key ingredients to launching powerful radio jets. Given many
of our radio-loud quasars are blue, our results present a possible challenge to
the ""blow-out"" paradigm of galaxy evolution models in which blue quasars are
the quiescent end result following a period of red quasar feedback initiated by
a galaxy merger. Finally, we find a tight correlation between black hole mass

instance in polynomial time, with polynomially many bits of communication, and
with exponentially small probability of error. (The prover may need exponential

provers use naive algorithms, inefficient even for small instances, that are
incompatible with practical implementations of automated reasoning.
  We bridge the gap between theory and practice by means of a novel interactive
protocol whose prover uses BDDs. We consider the problem of counting the number
of assignments to a QBF instance ($\#\textrm{CP}$), which has a natural
BDD-based algorithm. We give an interactive protocol for $\#\textrm{CP}$ whose

losses, such as the classical vertical multijunction cells, 'lateral' tandem
cells, and multi-exciton generation in the form of photon up- and
down-conversion. While in theory, efficiencies exceeding 90% are possible
(Landsberg or thermodynamic limit), there are severe practical limitations in
terms of processability, cost, and spectral sensitivity. Here, we present a
simulation environment based on Bayesian Optimization that is able to predict
and optimize the electrical performance of multi-junction architectures, both
vertical and lateral, in combination with multi-exciton materials. With respect
to vertical stacks, we show that by optimizing bandgap energies of
multi-exciton generation (MEG) layers, double junctions can reach efficiencies
beyond those of five-junction tandem devices (57%). Moreover, such combinations
of MEG and double junction devices would be highly resilient against spectral
changes of the incoming sunlight. We point out three main challenges for PV
material science to realize such devices. With respect to lateral

virtually optimise the active layer (such as, the film thickness and the
donor-acceptor ratio) for a given architecture. The simulation environment thus

neutral. In this way, the fractionation region is placed in the chromosphere,

to occur, that might otherwise be problematic with a coronal fractionation
site. The principal mechanism behind the mass-independent FIP fractionation
becoming the mass dependent impulsive SEP fractionation is the suppression of
acoustic waves in the chromosphere. The ponderomotive force causing the
fractionation must be due to torsional Alfven waves, which couple much less
effectively to slow modes than do shear waves, and upward propagating acoustic
waves deriving from photospheric convection must be effectively mode converted
to fast modes at the chromospheric layer where Alfven and sound speeds are
equal, and subsequently totally internally reflected. We further discuss

resolving the surface stress is computationally intensive, motivating modeling
approaches. In this work, a dynamic wave drag model is developed for Large Eddy
Simulation to quantify the effects of multiscale dynamically rough surfaces on
the atmospheric boundary layer. The waves are vertically unresolved, and the
total drag due to the horizontally resolved portion of the wave spectrum is
computed through a superposition of the force from each mode. As LES can only
resolve the horizontal wind-wave interactions to the filter scale $\Delta$, the
effects of the horizontally unresolved, subfilter waves are modeled by
specifying a roughness length scale characterizing the unresolved wave energy
spectrum. This subfilter roughness is set proportional to the subfilter
root-mean-square of the height distribution, and the constant of
proportionality is evaluated dynamically during the simulation based on the
assumption that the total drag force at the wave surface is independent of the
filter scale. The dynamic approach is used to simulate the airflow over a
spectrum of moving waves and the results are validated against high-fidelity
phase-resolved simulations. The dynamic approach combined with the wave
spectrum drag model is then used to study flow through a fixed-bottom offshore
wind farm. The dynamic model accurately adapts to the changing velocity field
and accurately predicts the mean velocity profiles and power produced from the
offshore wind farm. Further, the effect of the wind-wave interactions on the

regions due to limited available reference information for plausible
generation. To mitigate this, existing methods incorporate the extra cue as a
guidance for image completion. Despite improvements, these approaches are often
restricted to employing a single modality (e.g., segmentation or sketch maps),
which lacks scalability in leveraging multi-modality for more plausible
completion. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple yet effective method for
Multi-modal Guided Image Completion, dubbed MaGIC, which not only supports a
wide range of single modality as the guidance (e.g., text, canny edge, sketch,
segmentation, reference image, depth, and pose), but also adapts to arbitrarily
customized combination of these modalities (i.e., arbitrary multi-modality) for
image completion. For building MaGIC, we first introduce a modality-specific
conditional U-Net (MCU-Net) that injects single-modal signal into a U-Net
denoiser for single-modal guided image completion. Then, we devise a consistent
modality blending (CMB) method to leverage modality signals encoded in multiple
learned MCU-Nets through gradient guidance in latent space. Our CMB is
training-free, and hence avoids the cumbersome joint re-training of different
modalities, which is the secret of MaGIC to achieve exceptional flexibility in
accommodating new modalities for completion. Experiments show the superiority
of MaGIC over state-of-arts and its generalization to various completion tasks
including in/out-painting and local editing. Our project with code and models
is available at yeates.github.io/MaGIC-Page/.

surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for future 6G wireless
communications. Benefiting from its high array gain, low cost, and low power
consumption, RISs are expected to greatly enlarge signal coverage, improve
system capacity, and increase energy efficiency. In this article, we
systematically overview the emerging RIS technology with the focus on its key
basics, nine fundamental issues, and one critical problem. Specifically, we
first explain the RIS basics, including its working principles, hardware
structures, and potential benefits for communications. Based on these basics,
nine fundamental issues of RISs, such as ``What's the differences between RISs
and massive MIMO?'' and ``Is RIS really intelligent?'', are explicitly
addressed to elaborate its technical features, distinguish it from existing
technologies, and clarify some misunderstandings in the literature. Then, one
critical problem of RISs is revealed that, due to the ``multiplicative fading''
effect, existing passive RISs can hardly achieve visible performance gains in
many communication scenarios with strong direct links. To address this critical
problem, a potential solution called active RISs is introduced, and its
effectiveness is demonstrated by numerical simulations.

studies show unusual plastic behaviour associated with ordinary and
superdislocations, making it necessary to gain a detailed understanding on
their core properties in individual phases and at the two-phase interfaces.
Unfortunately, extended superdislocation cores are widely dissociated beyond
the length scales practical for routine first-principles density-functional
theory (DFT) calculations, while extant interatomic potentials are not
quantitatively accurate to reveal mechanistic origins of the unusual
core-related behaviour in either phases. Here, we develop a highly-accurate
moment tensor potential (MTP) for the binary Ti-Al alloy system using a DFT
dataset covering a broad range of intermetallic and solid solution structures.
The optimized MTP is rigorously benchmarked against both previous and new DFT
calculations, and unlike existing potentials, is shown to possess outstanding
accuracy in nearly all tested mechanical properties, including lattice
parameters, elastic constants, surface energies, and generalized stacking fault
energies (GSFE) in both phases. The utility of the MTP is further demonstrated
by producing dislocation core structures largely consistent with expectations
from DFT-GSFE and experimental observations. The new MTP opens the path to
realistic modelling and simulations of bulk lattice and defect properties
relevant to the plastic deformation and fracture processes in $\gamma$-TiAl and

questions and may be outdated even when they are available. Large language
models (LLMs) are now capable of generating long-form texts, suggesting the
tantalizing possibility of automatically generating literature reviews on
demand. However, LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate (and potentially
misleading) texts by hallucinating or omitting important information. In the
healthcare context, this may render LLMs unusable at best and dangerous at
worst. Most discussion surrounding the benefits and risks of LLMs have been
divorced from specific applications. In this work, we seek to qualitatively
characterize the potential utility and risks of LLMs for assisting in
production of medical evidence reviews. We conducted 16 semi-structured
interviews with international experts in systematic reviews, grounding
discussion in the context of generating evidence reviews. Domain experts
indicated that LLMs could aid writing reviews, as a tool for drafting or
creating plain language summaries, generating templates or suggestions,
distilling information, crosschecking, and synthesizing or interpreting text
inputs. But they also identified issues with model outputs and expressed
concerns about potential downstream harms of confidently composed but
inaccurate LLM outputs which might mislead. Other anticipated potential
downstream harms included lessened accountability and proliferation of
automatically generated reviews that might be of low quality. Informed by this
qualitative analysis, we identify criteria for rigorous evaluation of
biomedical LLMs aligned with domain expert views.

= 2, 3, \ldots$) are actively investigated and allows various generalizations,
for which there are a number of results. At the same time, almost nothing is
known about the structure and properties of the original groups AC($F_r$). In
this paper we define a class $\{A_{r, s}: r, s \geq 1\}$ of generalized
Andrews-Curtis groups in which any group $A_{r,r}$ is isomorphic to the
Andrews-Curtis group AC($F_r$). We prove that every group $A_{2,s}$\, ($s \geq
1$) is non-finitely presented. Hence the Andrews-Curtis group AC($F_2$) $\simeq
A_{2,2}$ is non-finitely presented. Thus, we give a partial answer to the
well-known question about the finite presentability of the groups AC($F_r$),
explicitly stated by J. Swan and A. Lisitsa in the Kourovka notebook \cite{KN}
(Question 18.89).

others remain elusive and the attempts on its full proof never stop. When the
$\Omega$ background parameters satisfy $-\epsilon_1/\epsilon_2\equiv \beta =1$,
the story simplifies a bit. A proof of the correspondence in the case of
$A_{1}$ gauge group was given in 2010 by Mironov et al., while the $A_{n}$

Selberg integral of $n+1$ Schur polynomials. Then in 2020, Albion et al.
obtained the rigorous result of this formula. In this paper, we show that their
result is equivalent to the conjecture on Selberg integral of Schur

perform a double check, we also directly start from this formula, and manage to

global-in-time classical solutions of their Bellman and master equations.
Rather than developing the analytical approach via tackling the Bellman and
master equation directly, we apply the maximum principle approach by
considering the induced forward-backward ordinary differential equation (FBODE)
system; indeed, we first show the local-in-time unique existence of the
solution of the FBODE system for a variety of terminal data by Banach fixed
point argument, and then provide crucial a priori estimates of bounding the
sensitivity of the terminal data for the backward equation by utilizing a
monotonicity condition that can be deduced from the positive definiteness of
the Schur complement of the Hessian matrix of the Lagrangian in the lifted
version and manipulating first order condition appropriately; this uniform
bound over the whole planning horizon $[0, T]$ allows us to partition $[0, T]$
into a number of sub-intervals with a common small length and then glue the
consecutive local-in-time solutions together to form the unique global-in-time
solution of the FBODE system. The regularity of the global-in-time solution
follows from that of the local ones due to the regularity assumptions on the
coefficient functions. Moreover, the regularity of the value function will also
be shown with the aid of the regularity of the solution couple of the FBODE
system and the regularity assumptions on the coefficient functions, with which
we can further deduce that this value function and its linear functional
derivative satisfy the Bellman and master equations, respectively.

veracity judgment. We conduct experiments on complex political claims in the
ClaimDecomp dataset and show that the aggregated evidence produced by our

various tasks and gained significant attention. LLMs are also used for local
sequence transduction tasks, including grammatical error correction (GEC) and

Representing an edit operation with a span of the source text and changed

computational cost for inference. We apply instruction tuning for LLMs on the

achieves comparable performance to the baseline in four tasks, paraphrasing,

survived some sort of transient event from view. Dust formed in a transient is
expanding away from the star and, in spherical models, the mass and energy
budgets implied by a high optical depth at late times make such models
untenable. Concentrating the dust in a disk or torus can in principle hide a
source from an equatorial observer using less mass and so delay this problem.
However, using axisymmetric dust radiation transfer models with a range of
equatorial dust concentrations, we find that this is quite difficult to achieve
in practice. The polar optical depth must be either low or high to avoid
scattering optical photons to equatorial observers. Most of the emission
remains at wavelengths easily observed by JWST, and the equatorial brightness
is reduced by at most a factor of ~2 compared to isotropic emission even for
equatorial (visual) optical depths of 1000. It is particularly difficult to
hide a source with silicate dusts because the absorption feature near 10\

eigenspectra and eigenstates display universal statistical properties described
by random matrix theory (RMT). However, eigenstates of local systems also
encode structure beyond RMT. To capture this, we introduce a quantitative
metric for quantum chaos which utilizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence to
compare the microcanonical distribution of entanglement entropy (EE) of
midspectrum eigenstates with a reference RMT distribution generated by pure
random states (with appropriate constraints). The metric compares not just the
averages of the distributions, but also higher moments. The differences in
moments are compared on a highly-resolved scale set by the standard deviation
of the RMT distribution, which is exponentially small in system size. This
distinguishes between chaotic and integrable behavior, and also quantifies the
degree of chaos in systems assumed to be chaotic. We study this metric in local
minimally structured Floquet random circuits, as well as a canonical family of
many-body Hamiltonians, the mixed field Ising model (MFIM). For Hamiltonian
systems, the reference random distribution must be constrained to incorporate
the effect of energy conservation. The metric captures deviations from RMT
across all models and parameters, including those that have been previously
identified as strongly chaotic, and for which other diagnostics of chaos such
as level spacing statistics look strongly thermal. In Floquet circuits, the
dominant source of deviations is the second moment of the distribution, and
this persists for all system sizes. For the MFIM, we find significant variation
of the KL divergence in parameter space. Notably, we find a small region where
deviations from RMT are minimized, suggesting that ""maximally chaotic""
Hamiltonians may exist in fine-tuned pockets of parameter space.

the inherent presence of concept drifts, which are commonly defined as

error rates produced by an underlying OL algorithm in order to identify if a
concept drift occurred or not, such that the OL algorithm can adapt

false negative rates, but they still tend to exhibit high false positive rates
in the concept-drift detection. This may impact the performance of the learner
and result in an undue amount of computational resources spent on retraining a
model that actually still performs within its expected range. In this paper, we
propose OPTWIN, our ""OPTimal WINdow"" concept drift detector. OPTWIN uses a
sliding window of events over an incoming data stream to track the errors of an

variances of the error rates produced by a learner in order to split the
sliding window into two provably optimal sub-windows, such that the split
occurs at the earliest event at which a statistically significant difference

large in-domain data. To address this paucity, recent methods leverage these
powerful models to generate high-quality task and domain-specific synthetic

generation (QGen) for Question-Answering (QA) and binary (yes/no) relevance
prediction, where for instance, the QGen models are given a document, and
trained to generate a query relevant to that document. However in many
problems, we have a more fine-grained notion of relevance than a simple yes/no

can be leveraged for nuanced relevance prediction. We demonstrate that --
contrary to claims from prior works -- current QGen approaches fall short of
the more conventional cross-domain transfer-learning approaches. Via empirical
studies spanning 3 public e-commerce benchmarks, we identify new shortcomings
of existing QGen approaches -- including their inability to distinguish between
different grades of relevance. To address this, we introduce label-conditioned
QGen models which incorporates knowledge about the different relevance. While
our experiments demonstrate that these modifications help improve performance
of QGen techniques, we also find that QGen approaches struggle to capture the

accurate distances can be determined through stellar parallaxes. There is no
good method for obtaining galaxy distances that is applicable from the near

The recourse is the distance ladder involving multiple methods with overlapping
domains. Good progress is being made on this project, with satisfactory
procedures and linkages identified and tested across the necessary distance
range. Best values of H0 from the distance ladder lie in the range 73 - 75

spectrum of fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, coupled with
constraints favoring the existence of dark energy from distant supernova
measurements, there is the precise prediction that H0 = 67.4 to 1%. If it is
conclusively determined that the Hubble constant is well above 70 km/s/Mpc as

and the state. We estimate the effects of stimulus-relevant representational
drift on decoding using a publicly accessible dataset of mouse V1 responses to
a natural movie. Because the only invariant component of the sensory experience
across all 24 animals is that they all watch the same natural movie, we can
learn a subject-invariant efficient neural representation that retains only
stimulus-relevant components. We use contrastive learning between the neural
response and the stimulus to learn a neural representation for
stimulus-relevant features. This learned representation minimizes decoding
error as quantified by Bayes risk. We show that it can be used to read out
behaviorally relevant stimulus features (time, static scene, optic flow, and
joint spatio-temporal features) at 33ms resolution accurately, a finer
timescale than what has previously been explored. When we use the model trained
on one recording session to derive feature activations on another, decoding
performance is reduced by approximately $40\%$. Motion encoding is most
susceptible to representational drift. In addition, when we enlarge the error
tolerance window to 1sec, we recover stable stimulus encoding across sessions,
echoing previous findings. This shows that decoding stimulus features that vary

compensate for representational drift.

deep neural network when it is trained beyond performance plateaus. Open
questions include whether neural collapse leads to better generalization and,
if so, why and how training beyond the plateau helps. We model neural collapse
as an information bottleneck (IB) problem in order to investigate whether such
a compact representation exists and discover its connection to generalization.
We demonstrate that neural collapse leads to good generalization specifically
when it approaches an optimal IB solution of the classification problem. Recent
research has shown that two deep neural networks independently trained with the
same contrastive loss objective are linearly identifiable, meaning that the
resulting representations are equivalent up to a matrix transformation. We
leverage linear identifiability to approximate an analytical solution of the IB
problem. This approximation demonstrates that when class means exhibit
$K$-simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) behavior (e.g., $K$=10 for CIFAR10
and $K$=100 for CIFAR100), they coincide with the critical phase transitions of
the corresponding IB problem. The performance plateau occurs once the optimal
solution for the IB problem includes all of these phase transitions. We also
show that the resulting $K$-simplex ETF can be packed into a $K$-dimensional
Gaussian distribution using supervised contrastive learning with a ResNet50
backbone. This geometry suggests that the $K$-simplex ETF learned by supervised
contrastive learning approximates the optimal features for source coding.
Hence, there is a direct correspondence between optimal IB solutions and
generalization in contrastive learning.

stochastic algorithm for optimizing the robust contrastive loss with a provable
convergence guarantee without using large mini-batch sizes. Theoretical and
experimental results show that our algorithm automatically learns a suitable
$\tau$ for each sample. Specifically, samples with frequent semantics use large
temperatures to keep local semantic structures, while samples with rare
semantics use small temperatures to induce more separable features. Our method
not only outperforms prior strong baselines (e.g., SimCLR, CLIP) on unimodal

optimality: committing to the assignment of one sub-problem can rule out the
optimal solution from the search space. In other research areas, Logic-Based
Benders Decomposition (LBBD) proved effective; in LBBD, the problem is
decomposed into a Master Problem (MP) and one or several Sub-Problems (SP). The
solution of the MP is passed to the SPs, that can possibly fail. In case of
failure, a no-good is returned to the MP, that is solved again with the

droplet as due to statistical variations in the collisions of water molecules
with the grain, followed up by Perrin's experiments, provided one of the most
convincing demonstrations of the reality of atoms. But in 1926 Schroedinger
replaced classical particles by wavefunctions, which cannot undergo collisions.
Can a Schroedingerist wavefunction physics account for Perrin's observations?
As systems confined to a finite box can only generate quasiperiodic signals,
this seems impossible, but I argue here that the issue is more subtle. I then
introduce several models of the droplet-plus-grain; unfortunately, no explicit
solutions are available (related is the remarkable fact that the harmonics of a
general right triangle are still unknown). But from generic features of the
models I conclude that: (a) wavefunction models may generate trajectories
resembling those of a stochastic process; (b) diffusive behavior may appear for
a restricted time interval; and (c) additional ``Wave Function Energy"", by
restricting ``cat"" formation, can render the observations more ``classical"".
But completing the Einstein program of linking diffusion to viscosity and
temperature in wavefunction models is still challenging.

be able to both efficiently perform tasks as well as adapt to human behavior

competing, aspects of interaction. We propose a real-time motion-planning
framework for robotic manipulators that can simultaneously optimize a set of
both task- and human-centric cost functions. To this end, we formulate a
Nonlinear Model-Predictive Control (NMPC) problem with kino-dynamic constraints
and efficiently solve it by leveraging recent advances in nonlinear trajectory
optimization. We employ stochastic predictions of the human partner's
trajectories in order to adapt the robot's nominal behavior in anticipation of
its human partner. Our framework explicitly models and allows balancing of
different task- and human-centric cost functions. While previous approaches to
trajectory optimization for CP-HRI take anywhere from several seconds to a full
minute to compute a trajectory, our approach is capable of computing one in 318
ms on average, enabling real-time implementation. We illustrate the
effectiveness of our framework by simultaneously optimizing for separation
distance, end-effector visibility, legibility, smoothness, and deviation from
nominal behavior. We also demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to
prior work in terms of the chosen cost functions, while significantly improving
computational efficiency.

coresets are constructed in a problem-dependent manner, where for each problem,
a new coreset construction algorithm is usually suggested, a process that may
take time or may be hard for new researchers in the field. Even the generic

limiting their applicability. To this end, we suggest an automatic practical
framework for constructing coresets, which requires (only) the input data and
the desired cost function from the user, without the need for any other
task-related computation to be done by the user. To do so, we reduce the
problem of approximating a loss function to an instance of vector summation
approximation, where the vectors we aim to sum are loss vectors of a specific
subset of the queries, such that we aim to approximate the image of the
function on this subset. We show that while this set is limited, the coreset is
quite general. An extensive experimental study on various machine learning

tPC can be viewed as a classical Asymmetric Hopfield Network (AHN) with an

in sequential memory tasks of structured inputs. Moreover, we find that tPC
with a multi-layer structure can encode context-dependent information, thus
distinguishing between repeating elements appearing in a sequence, a
computation attributed to the hippocampus. Our work establishes a possible
computational mechanism underlying sequential memory in the brain that can also
be theoretically interpreted using existing memory model frameworks.

systems evolving unitarily may equilibrate, since the evolution of some
observables may be around an equilibrium value with negligible fluctuations
most of the time. There are rigorous theorems giving the conditions for such
equilibration to happen. In particular, initial states prepared with a lack of
resolution in the energy will equilibrate. We investigate how equilibration may
be affected by a lack of resolution, or coarse-graining, in the magnetization
of the initial state. In particular, for a chaotic spin chain and using exact
diagonalization, we show that an initial state with welldefined magnetization
almost does not equilibrate. On the contrary, a coarse, not well-defined,
magnetization induces equilibration in a way that will depend on the degree of
coarse graining. We also analyze the time for the system to reach equilibrium,
showing good agreement with theoretical estimates and with some evidence that
less resolution leads to faster equilibration. Our study highlights the crucial
role of initial state preparation in the equilibration dynamics of quantum
systems and provides new insights into the fundamental nature of equilibration

Mapping these populations, and exploring transient phenomena within them, are

dedicated relatively few visits to the Galactic Plane region, more recent
strategies under consideration envision higher cadence within selected regions
of high scientific interest. The range of galactic science presents a challenge
in evaluating which strategies deliver the highest scientific returns. Here we
present metrics designed to evaluate Rubin survey strategy simulations based on
the cadence of observations they deliver within regions of interest to
different topics in galactic science, using variability categories defined by
timescale. We also compare the fractions of exposures obtained in each filter
with those recommended for the different science goals. We find that the
baseline_v2.x simulations deliver observations of the high-priority regions at
sufficiently high cadence to reliably detect variability on timescales >10 d or
more. Follow-up observations may be necessary to properly characterize
variability, especially transients, on shorter timescales. Combining the
regions of interest for all the science cases considered, we identify those

explanations that would remain valid if the model is updated or changed even
slightly. Towards finding robust counterfactuals, existing literature often
assumes that the original model $m$ and the new model $M$ are bounded in the
parameter space, i.e., $\|\text{Params}(M){-}\text{Params}(m)\|{<}\Delta$.
However, models can often change significantly in the parameter space with
little to no change in their predictions or accuracy on the given dataset. In
this work, we introduce a mathematical abstraction termed
\emph{naturally-occurring} model change, which allows for arbitrary changes in
the parameter space such that the change in predictions on points that lie on
the data manifold is limited. Next, we propose a measure -- that we call
\emph{Stability} -- to quantify the robustness of counterfactuals to potential
model changes for differentiable models, e.g., neural networks. Our main
contribution is to show that counterfactuals with sufficiently high value of
\emph{Stability} as defined by our measure will remain valid after potential
``naturally-occurring'' model changes with high probability (leveraging
concentration bounds for Lipschitz function of independent Gaussians). Since
our quantification depends on the local Lipschitz constant around a data point
which is not always available, we also examine practical relaxations of our
proposed measure and demonstrate experimentally how they can be incorporated to
find robust counterfactuals for neural networks that are close, realistic, and
remain valid after potential model changes.

material through a combination of stellar winds and interactions with a close
binary companion, but the exact ejecta mass ranges covered by each subtype and
how it relates to the zero-age main-sequence progenitor mass is still unclear.
Using a combination of semi-analytic modeling and numerical simulations, we
discuss how the properties of SESN progenitors can be constrained through
different phases of the bolometric light curve. We find that the light curve
rise time is strongly impacted by the strength of radioactive nickel mixing and
treatment of helium recombination. These can vary between events and are often
not accounted for in simpler modeling approaches, leading to large
uncertainties in ejecta masses inferred from the rise. Motivated by this, we
focus on the late time slope, which is determined by gamma-ray leakage. We
calibrate the relationship between ejecta mass, explosion energy, and gamma-ray
escape time $T_0$ using a suite of numerical models. Application of the fitting
function we provide to bolometric light curves of SESNe should result in ejecta
masses with approximately 20\% uncertainty. With large samples of SESNe coming
from current and upcoming surveys, our methods can be utilized to better
understand the diversity and origin of the progenitor stars.

parcel crop rotation and local crop distribution. To evaluate our approach, we

  arXiv:1604.05473",,,,"math.OC cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In many modern data sets, High dimension low sample size (HDLSS) data is
prevalent in many fields of studies. There has been an increased focus recently
on using machine learning and statistical methods to mine valuable information
out of these data sets. Thus, there has been an increased interest in efficient
learning in high dimensions. Naturally, as the dimension of the input data
increases, the learning task will become more difficult, due to increasing
computational and statistical complexities. This makes it crucial to overcome
the curse of dimensionality in a given dataset, within a reasonable time frame,
in a bid to obtain the insights required to keep a competitive edge. To solve
HDLSS problems, classical methods such as support vector machines can be
utilised to alleviate data piling at the margin. However, when we question
geometric domains and their assumptions on input data, we are naturally lead to
convex optimisation problems and this gives rise to the development of
solutions like distance weighted discrimination (DWD), which can be modelled as
a second-order cone programming problem and solved by interior-point methods
when sample size and feature dimensions of the data is moderate. In this paper,
our focus is on designing an even more scalable and robust algorithm for
solving large-scale generalized DWD problems.

analyze time-series data in simulation and experimentally. Our system achieves
a 98% accuracy rate for spoken digit classification and a normalized mean
square error of 0.0012 in a second-order non-linear regression task. Further,
to demonstrate the device's real-time temporal data processing capability, we
demonstrate a 100% accuracy for an electroencephalography (EEG) signal

that for a random input sequence, each memcapacitor consumes on average 41.5fJ
of energy per spike, irrespective of the chosen input voltage pulse width, and
415fW of average power for 100 ms pulse width, orders of magnitude lower than
the state-of-the-art devices. Lastly, we believe the biocompatible, soft nature
of our memcapacitor makes it highly suitable for computing and
signal-processing applications in biological environments.

passenger group sizes, and vehicle capacity, along with the investigation of
the effects of vehicle rebalancing. Our comparative analysis highlights the

density and road directionality are found to significantly impact the
performance. NeurADP is found to be more efficient in learning value function

inter-related task with the tasks typically defined in the sense of either
regression or classification. In recent years, CL has been studied extensively
when these tasks are defined using Euclidean data-- data, such as images, that
can be described by a set of vectors in an n-dimensional real space. However,
the literature is quite sparse, when the data corresponding to a CL task is
nonEuclidean-- data , such as graphs, point clouds or manifold, where the
notion of similarity in the sense of Euclidean metric does not hold. For
instance, a graph is described by a tuple of vertices and edges and
similarities between two graphs is not well defined through a Euclidean metric.
Due to this fundamental nature of the data, developing CL for nonEuclidean data
presents several theoretical and methodological challenges. In particular, CL
for graphs requires explicit modelling of nonstationary behavior of vertices
and edges and their effects on the learning problem. Therefore, in this work,
we develop a adaptive dynamic programming viewpoint for CL with graphs. In this
work, we formulate a two-player sequential game between the act of learning new
tasks~(generalization) and remembering previously learned tasks~(forgetting).
We prove mathematically the existence of a solution to the game and demonstrate
convergence to the solution of the game. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our method on a number of graph benchmarks with a comprehensive ablation

resources is a key problem in power system operations. In recent years, a
number of advanced controllers have been designed to optimize frequency

the system remains constant over a sufficiently long time. Given the
intermittent and uncertain nature of renewable resources, it is becoming
important to explicitly consider net load that is time-varying.
  This paper proposes an adaptive approach to frequency control in power
systems with significant time-varying net load. We leverage the advances in
short-term load forecasting, where the net load in the system can be accurately
predicted using weather and other features. We integrate these predictions into
the design of adaptive controllers, which can be seamlessly combined with most
existing controllers including conventional droop control and emerging neural

globular clusters orbiting a host galaxy. Globular cluster streams are of
particular interest since they are thin (dynamically cold) and therefore
sensitive to perturbations from low-mass subhalos. Since the subhalo mass
function differs depending on the dark matter composition, these gaps can
provide unique constraints on dark matter models. However, current samples are
limited to the Milky Way. With its large field of view, deep imaging
sensitivity, and high angular resolution, the upcoming {\it Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope} ({\it Roman}); presents a unique opportunity to significantly
increase the number of observed streams and gaps. This paper presents a first
exploration of the prospects for detecting gaps in streams in M31 and other
nearby galaxies with resolved stars. We simulate the formation of gaps in a
Palomar-5-like stream and generate mock observations of these gaps together
with background stars in M31 and foreground Milky Way stellar fields. We assess
{\it Roman}'s ability to detect gaps out to 10~Mpc through visual inspection
and with the gap-finding tool {\it FindTheGap}. We conclude that gaps of
$\approx 1.5$~kpc in streams that are created from subhalos of masses $\geq5

1000s--1~hour. This volume contains $\approx$ 200 galaxies. Large samples of

techniques for our numerical results and focus on three dynamical quantities:
(i) out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), (ii) operator entanglement of the
dynamics, and (iii) entanglement growth following a quench from product initial

operator entanglement is a robust measure of dynamical properties of interest.
Moreover, we show that the short-time growth of operator entanglement can
generically detect ``entanglement phase transitions'' in these systems while
its long-time average is shown to be a reliable indicator of quantum chaos and
entanglement phases. This allows us to extend operator entanglement based
diagnostics from previous works on closed and open quantum systems, to the new

illuminated various properties of optimization algorithms, the analysis of each
case typically required a different proof technique with significantly
different mathematical tools. In this study, we make a novel connection between
learning theory and applied probability and introduce a unified guideline for

illustrate our approach on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and we obtain

number of iterations) for strongly convex losses and non-convex losses with
additive noise, where we recover similar results to the prior art or extend
them to more general cases by using a single proof technique. Our approach is
flexible and can be generalizable to other popular optimizers, as it mainly
requires developing Lyapunov functions, which are often readily available in
the literature. It also illustrates that ergodicity is an important component
for obtaining time-uniform bounds -- which might not be achieved for convex or
non-convex losses unless additional noise is injected to the iterates. Finally,
we slightly stretch our analysis technique and prove time-uniform bounds for
SGD under convex and non-convex losses (without additional additive noise),

Specifically, we construct the wideband channel model of the echo signal, and
design a beamforming scheme that controls the range of beam squint by adjusting
the values of phase shifters and true time delay lines (TTDs). By doing this,
beams at different subcarriers can be aligned along different directions in a
planned way. The received echo signals of different subcarriers will carry
target information in different directions, based on which the targets' angles
can be estimated through sophisticatedly designed algorithm. Moreover, we
propose a supporting OFDM ranging algorithm that can estimate the targets'
distances by comparing the theoretical phases and measured phases of the echo
signals. Interestingly, the proposed localization method only needs the base
station to transmit and receive the signals once, which can be termed You Only

multiple times beam sweeping, the proposed one greatly reduces the sensing

concept of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ supersolid resulting from spontaneous breaking of a

pseudo-Goldstone mode, whose excitation gap at long wavelength limit is found
to decrease fast with $n$. We further numerically show that, when confined in a

domain decomposition method with buffer zone for overlap, in the proposed
direct unified wave-particle (DUWP) method, the NS solver is coupled with DSMC

the DSMC solver leads the simulation, while the NS solver leads the continuum
flow simulation. Thus advantages of accuracy and efficiency are both taken. At
internal flow regimes, like the transition flow regime, the method is accurate
as well because a kind of mesoscopic modeling is proposed in this work, which
gives the DUWP method the multi-scale property. Specifically, as to the
collision process, at $t < \tau$, it is supposed that only single collision
happens, and the collision term of DSMC is just used. At $t > \tau$, it is
derived that $1-\tau/\Delta t$ of particles should experience multiple

two approaches: optimize an objective such as compactness or, drawing on fair
division, construct a protocol whose outcomes guarantee partisan fairness. We
aim to have the best of both worlds by optimizing an objective subject to a
binary fairness constraint. As the fairness constraint we adopt the geometric
target, which requires the number of seats won by each party to be at least the
average (rounded down) of its outcomes under the worst and best partitions of
the state.
  To study the feasibility of this approach, we introduce a new model of
redistricting that closely mirrors the classic model of cake-cutting. This
model has two innovative features. First, in any part of the state there is an
underlying 'density' of voters with political leanings toward any given party,
making it impossible to finely separate voters for different parties into
different districts. This captures a realistic constraint that previously
existing theoretical models of redistricting tend to ignore. Second, parties
may disagree on the distribution of voters - whether by genuine disagreement or
attempted strategic behavior. In the absence of a 'ground truth' distribution,
a redistricting algorithm must therefore aim to simultaneously be fair to each
party with respect to its own reported data. Our main theoretical result is
that, surprisingly, the geometric target is always feasible with respect to
arbitrarily diverging data sets on how voters are distributed.
  Any standard for fairness is only useful if it can be readily satisfied in
practice. Our empirical results, which use real election data and maps of six
US states, demonstrate that the geometric target is always feasible, and that
imposing it as a fairness constraint comes at almost no cost to three
well-studied optimization objectives.

  Safety Filters",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Text-to-image generative models such as Stable Diffusion and DALL$\cdot$E 2
have attracted much attention since their publication due to their wide
application in the real world. One challenging problem of text-to-image
generative models is the generation of Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content, e.g.,
those related to violence and adult. Therefore, a common practice is to deploy
a so-called safety filter, which blocks NSFW content based on either text or
image features. Prior works have studied the possible bypass of such safety
filters. However, existing works are largely manual and specific to Stable
Diffusion's official safety filter. Moreover, the bypass ratio of Stable
Diffusion's safety filter is as low as 23.51% based on our evaluation.
  In this paper, we propose the first automated attack framework, called
SneakyPrompt, to evaluate the robustness of real-world safety filters in
state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models. Our key insight is to search
for alternative tokens in a prompt that generates NSFW images so that the
generated prompt (called an adversarial prompt) bypasses existing safety
filters. Specifically, SneakyPrompt utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to
guide an agent with positive rewards on semantic similarity and bypass success.
  Our evaluation shows that SneakyPrompt successfully generated NSFW content
using an online model DALL$\cdot$E 2 with its default, closed-box safety filter
enabled. At the same time, we also deploy several open-source state-of-the-art
safety filters on a Stable Diffusion model and show that SneakyPrompt not only
successfully generates NSFW content, but also outperforms existing adversarial
attacks in terms of the number of queries and image qualities.

debris disk gas and use it test state-of-the-art models. We use new and
archival ALMA observations of CO and CI emission, complemented by CII data from
Herschel, for a sample of 14 debris disks. This expands the number of disks

We find that current state-of-the-art models of secondary gas production
overpredict the neutral carbon content of debris disk gas. This does not rule
out a secondary origin, but might indicate that the models require an
additional C removal process. Alternatively, the gas might be produced in
transient events rather than a steady-state collisional cascade. We also test a
primordial gas origin by comparing our results to a simplified thermo-chemical

remarkable performance on a variety of language understanding tasks. They
typically acquire this knowledge by learning from the pre-training text and
capturing certain patterns from it. However, real-world settings often present
scenarios that do not abide by these patterns i.e. scenarios that break the
common assumptions. Can state-of-the-art NLP models correctly reason over the
contexts of such scenarios?
  Addressing the above question, in this paper, we investigate the ability of
models to correctly reason over contexts that break the common assumptions. To
this end, we first systematically create evaluation data in which each data
instance consists of (a) a common assumption, (b) a context that follows the
assumption, (c) a context that breaks the assumption, and (d) questions based
on the contexts. Then, through evaluations on multiple models including GPT-3
and Flan T5, we show that while doing fairly well on contexts that follow the
common assumptions, the models struggle to correctly reason over contexts that
break those assumptions. Specifically, the performance gap is as high as 20%
absolute points. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze these results revealing
several interesting findings. We believe our work and findings will encourage
and facilitate further research in developing more robust models that can also
reliably reason over contexts that break the common assumptions. Data is

(FD) communication, where sending and receiving are done simultaneously. Hence,
severe interference leaked from the transmitter to the receiver, which can
disrupt the system's operation completely. For interference reduction, the
transceiver tries to estimate the interfering symbols to remove their effects.
A typical method is to use the Hammerstein model. In this method, nonlinear
power amplifier (PA) and multipath channel are modeled with a successive
nonlinear system and a finite impulse response (FIR) filter. Then, the model
parameters are adjusted, and interference symbols are estimated from the
transmitted symbols. In the Hammerstein method, the interference symbols are
estimated directly from the transmitted symbols. But practically, the
transmitted symbols first pass through the pulse-shaping filter and become a
signal. Then, this signal passes through the nonlinear PA and communication
channel. Finally, the received signal is filtered by the matched filter (MF) at
the receiver and converted to the symbols again. In this procedure, the
amplifier and the communication channel affect the transmitted signal directly
and distort transmitted symbols indirectly. Therefore, in the practical

critical for the performance of web-scale machine learning systems. A typical
model ingests hundreds of features with vocabularies on the order of millions

as a d-dimensional embedding, introducing hundreds of billions of parameters
for extremely high-cardinality features. This bottleneck has led to substantial
progress in alternative embedding algorithms. Many of these methods, however,
make the assumption that each feature uses an independent embedding table. This
work introduces a simple yet highly effective framework, Feature Multiplexing,
where one single representation space is used across many different categorical
features. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that multiplexed
embeddings can be decomposed into components from each constituent feature,
allowing models to distinguish between features. We show that multiplexed
representations lead to Pareto-optimal parameter-accuracy tradeoffs for three
public benchmark datasets. Further, we propose a highly practical approach
called Unified Embedding with three major benefits: simplified feature
configuration, strong adaptation to dynamic data distributions, and
compatibility with modern hardware. Unified embedding gives significant
improvements in offline and online metrics compared to highly competitive
baselines across five web-scale search, ads, and recommender systems, where it
serves billions of users across the world in industry-leading products.

the theory of relativity has successfully approximated material motion in

inelastic deformation. A comprehensive relativistic inelasticity model is
necessary to objectively measure inelastic deformation for observers with
varying velocities, including those near the speed of light. The proposed model
expands classical deformation tensors to four-dimensional tensors in
space-time, referred to as relativistic Cauchy-Green deformation tensors. By
introducing constitutive equations based on these tensors, objective
measurements of inelastic deformation are achieved while satisfying the second
law of thermodynamics. An illustrative example demonstrates the application of
this theory and explains the physical interpretations of the model. Moreover,
it is shown that the proposed relativistic inelasticity model converges to a

essential for ConvNets to perform accurate classification. Errors in
human-labeled training datasets are unavoidable due to the complexity of
satellite images. However, the distribution of human labeling errors on
satellite images and their impact on ConvNets have not been investigated. To
fill this research gap, this study, for the first time, collected real-world
labels from 32 participants and explored how their errors affect three ConvNets
(VGG16, GoogleNet and ResNet-50) for high-resolution satellite image scene
classification. We found that: (1) human labeling errors have significant class
and instance dependence, which is fundamentally different from the simulation
noise in previous studies; (2) regarding the overall accuracy of all classes,
when human labeling errors in training data increase by one unit, the overall
accuracy of ConvNets classification decreases by approximately half a unit; (3)
regarding the accuracy of each class, the impact of human labeling errors on
ConvNets shows large heterogeneity across classes. To uncover the mechanism
underlying the impact of human labeling errors on ConvNets, we further compared
it with two types of simulated labeling noise: uniform noise (errors
independent of both classes and instances) and class-dependent noise (errors
independent of instances but not classes). Our results show that the impact of
human labeling errors on ConvNets is similar to that of the simulated
class-dependent noise but not to that of the simulated uniform noise,
suggesting that the impact of human labeling errors on ConvNets is mainly due
to class-dependent errors rather than instance-dependent errors.

a normal Cartesian shearing box, although the time-averaged field strengths are

magnetic bursts, which are not seen in the Cartesian simulation. The importance
of the compressible amplification is also true for a cylindrical simulation

violates (ordinary) Lorentz symmetry is apparent to observers external to the

We show that the situation is symmetric: internal observers will judge physics
in the external laboratory to violate their own sonic Lorentz symmetries. We
therefore treat all observers on an equal footing such that each is able to
retain a commitment to their own Lorentz symmetries. We then generalize beyond
the case of subsystem-environment decompositions to situations in which there
exist multiple phonon fields, all obeying Lorentz symmetries but with different
invariant speeds. In such cases, we argue that all observers have freedom to
choose which field is symmetry preserving, and so -- in a certain precise sense
-- which other fields are perceived as having an 'ether.' This choice is
influenced -- but not determined -- by a desire for simplicity in the
description of physical laws. Sending information faster than sound serves as a
model of tachyonic signalling to a distant receiver. Immutable causality of the
laboratory setup when perceived externally to a sonic medium manifests
internally through the confinement of the tachyons to an apparent ether (with a
rest frame), which we call a 'tachyonic medium,' thereby preventing tachyonic
exchange from emulating the scenario of a round-trip signal travelling into an
observer's past causal cone. The assignment of sonic-Lorentz-violating effects
to fields that obey 'photonic' Lorentz symmetries thus ensures that causality
associated with the 'sonic' Lorentz symmetries is preserved.

distributionally robust optimization (group DRO) can alleviate this problem by
minimizing the worst-case loss over pre-defined groups. While promising, in
practice factors like expensive annotations and privacy preclude the
availability of group labels. More crucially, when taking a closer look at the
failure modes of out-of-distribution generalization, the typical procedure of
reweighting in group DRO loses efficiency. Hinged on the limitations, in this

Characterized by an interactive training mode, Q-Diversity relaxes the group
identification from annotation into direct parameterization. Furthermore, a
novel mixing strategy across groups is presented to diversify the

Updating the output layer using clipped gradient stabilizes it. We show that
the remaining layers are automatically stabilized provided the neural network
is only composed of squashing (compact range) activations. We also present a
novel squashing activation function - it is obtained by modifying a Gaussian
Error Linear Unit (GELU) to have compact range - we call it Truncated GELU
(tGELU). Unlike other squashing activations, such as sigmoid, the range of
tGELU can be explicitly specified. As a consequence, the problem of vanishing
gradients that arise due to a small range, e.g., in the case of a sigmoid
activation, is eliminated. We prove that a NN composed of squashing activations
(tGELU, sigmoid, etc.), when updated using the algorithm presented herein, is
numerically stable and has consistent performance (low variance). The theory is
supported by extensive experiments. Within reinforcement learning, as a
consequence of our study, we show that target networks in Deep Q-Learning can
be omitted, greatly speeding up learning and alleviating memory requirements.
Cross-entropy based classification algorithms that suffer from high variance
issues are more consistent when trained using our framework. One symptom of
numerical instability in training is the high variance of the neural network
update values. We show, in theory and through experiments, that our algorithm
updates have low variance, and the training loss reduces in a smooth manner.

categorization of GRB LCs remains a hurdle. We address LC gaps using a
'stochastic reconstruction,' wherein we fit two pre-existing models (Willingale
2007; W07 and Broken Power Law; BPL) to the observed LC, then use the
distribution of flux residuals from the original data to generate data to fill
in the temporal gaps. We also demonstrate a model-independent LC reconstruction
via Gaussian Processes. At 10% noise, the uncertainty of the end time of the
plateau, its correspondent flux, and the temporal decay index after the plateau
decreases, on average, by 33.3% 35.03%, and 43.32%, respectively for the W07,

other information of functions could be arbitrarily delayed, has received
increasing attention recently. Different from previous studies that focus on
stationary environments, this paper investigates the delayed OCO in
non-stationary environments, and aims to minimize the dynamic regret with
respect to any sequence of comparators. To this end, we first propose a simple
algorithm, namely DOGD, which performs a gradient descent step for each delayed
gradient according to their arrival order. Despite its simplicity, our novel
analysis shows that DOGD can attain an $O(\sqrt{dT}(P_T+1)$ dynamic regret
bound in the worst case, where $d$ is the maximum delay, $T$ is the time
horizon, and $P_T$ is the path length of comparators. More importantly, in case
delays do not change the arrival order of gradients, it can automatically
reduce the dynamic regret to $O(\sqrt{S}(1+P_T))$, where $S$ is the sum of
delays. Furthermore, we develop an improved algorithm, which can reduce those
dynamic regret bounds achieved by DOGD to $O(\sqrt{dT(P_T+1)})$ and
$O(\sqrt{S(1+P_T)})$, respectively. The essential idea is to run multiple DOGD
with different learning rates, and utilize a meta-algorithm to track the best
one based on their delayed performance. Finally, we demonstrate that our
improved algorithm is optimal in both cases by deriving a matching lower bound.

neural network training. When the training enters a region, which has a
smaller-loss-as-sharper (SLAS) structure, the training becomes unstable and
loss exponentially increases once it is too sharp, i.e., the rapid ascent of
the loss spike. The training becomes stable when it finds a flat region. The
deviation in the first eigen direction (with maximum eigenvalue of the loss
Hessian ($\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$) is found to be dominated by low-frequency.
Since low-frequency is captured very fast (frequency principle), the rapid
descent is then observed. Inspired by our analysis of loss spikes, we revisit
the link between $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ flatness and generalization. For real
datasets, low-frequency is often dominant and well-captured by both the
training data and the test data. Then, a solution with good generalization and
a solution with bad generalization can both learn low-frequency well, thus,
they have little difference in the sharpest direction. Therefore, although
$\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ can indicate the sharpness of the loss landscape,
deviation in its corresponding eigen direction is not responsible for the
generalization difference. We also find that loss spikes can facilitate
condensation, i.e., input weights evolve towards the same, which may be the
underlying mechanism for why the loss spike improves generalization, rather
than simply controlling the value of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$.

avoiding data sharing and assuming privacy at the human or environment level,
as prior works have done, the accuracy decreases by 5-7%. However, extending
this to the modality level and strictly separating sensor data between multiple

necessary for the ethical utilisation of passive sensing methods in HAR, we
implement a system where clients mutually train both a general FL model and a

only a 7-13% decrease in accuracy, making it possible to build HAR systems with

  detected magnetic resonance with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center is a promising candidate to realize
practical quantum sensors with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution,
even at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In conventional
high-frequency AC magnetometry with NV centers, the setup requires a pulse
sequence with an appropriate time synchronization and strong microwave power.
To avoid these practical difficulties, AC magnetic field sensing using
continuous-wave opticallydetected magnetic resonance (CW-ODMR) was recently
demonstrated. That previous study utilized radio frequency (RF) dressed states
generated by the coherent interaction between the electron spin of the NV
center and the RF wave. However, the drawback of this method is that the
detectable frequency of the AC magnetic fields is fixed. Here, we propose and
demonstrate frequency-tunable magnetic field sensing based on CW-ODMR. In the
new sensing scheme, we obtain RF double-dressed states by irradiation with a RF
field at two different frequencies. One creates the RF dressed states and
changes the frequency of the target AC field. The other is a target AC field
that induces a change in the CW-ODMR spectrum by generating the RF
double-dressed states through coherent interaction with the RF dressed states.
The sensitivity of our method is estimated to be comparable to or even higher
than that of the conventional method based on a RF field with a single
frequency. The estimated bandwidth is 7.45 MHz, higher than that of the
conventional method using the RF dressed states. Our frequency-tunable magnetic
field sensor based on CW-ODMR paves the way for new applications in diamond
devices.

creating a progressively escalating risk of default for credit bond investors.
Given the current incomplete and inaccurate bond information disclosure, timely
tracking and forecasting the individual credit bond default risks have become
essential to maintain market stability and ensure healthy development. This
paper proposes an Intelligent Forecasting Framework for Default Risk that
provides precise day-by-day default risk prediction. In this framework, we
first summarize the factors that impact credit bond defaults and construct a
risk index system. Then, we employ a combined default probability annotation
method based on the evolutionary characteristics of bond default risk. The
method considers the weighted average of Variational Bayesian Gaussian Mixture
estimation, Market Index estimation, and Default Trend Backward estimation for
daily default risk annotation of matured or defaulted bonds according to the
risk index system. Moreover, to mine time-series correlation and
cross-sectional index correlation features efficiently, an intelligent
prediction model for Chinese credit bond default risk is designed using the
ConvLSTM neural network and trained with structured feature data. The
experiments demonstrate that the predicted individual bond risk is slightly
higher and substantially more responsive to fluctuations than the risk
indicated by authoritative ratings, thereby improving on the inadequacies of
inflated and untimely bond ratings. Consequently, this study's findings offer
multiple insights for regulators, issuers, and investors.

continuous diffusion on them to successfully fuse extracted image features for

(e.g. Gaussian) distribution, towards an empirical target distribution
associated with a training data set. Once trained by minimizing a variational
objective, the learnt map provides an approximate generative model of the
target distribution. Since standard NF implement differentiable maps, they may
suffer from pathological behaviors when targeting complex distributions. For
instance, such problems may appear for distributions on multi-component
topologies or characterized by multiple modes with high probability regions
separated by very unlikely areas. A typical symptom is the explosion of the
Jacobian norm of the transformation in very low probability areas. This paper
proposes to overcome this issue thanks to a new Markov chain Monte Carlo
algorithm to sample from the target distribution in the latent domain before
transporting it back to the target domain. The approach relies on a Metropolis
adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) whose dynamics explicitly exploits the
Jacobian of the transformation. Contrary to alternative approaches, the
proposed strategy preserves the tractability of the likelihood and it does not

Accelerating learning is an active field of RL highly relevant in the context
of time-varying systems. Traditional transfer learning methods propose to use
prior knowledge of the system behavior to devise a gradual or immediate
data-driven transformation of the control policy obtained through RL. Such
transformation is usually computed by estimating the performance of previous
control policies based on measurements recently collected from the system.
However, such retrospective measures have debatable utility with no guarantees
of positive transfer in most cases. Instead, we propose a model-based
transformation, such that when actions from a control policy are applied to the
target system, a positive transfer is achieved. The transformation can be used
as an initialization for the reinforcement learning process to converge to a
new optimum. We validate the performance of our approach through four benchmark
examples. We demonstrate that our approach is more sample-efficient than
fine-tuning with reinforcement learning alone and achieves comparable
performance to linear-quadratic-regulators and model-predictive control when an
accurate linear model is known in the three cases. If an accurate model is not
known, we empirically show that the proposed approach still guarantees positive

modulations in the wave field and, in particular, in the significant wave
height. We examine this phenomenon in the case of waves scattered by a
localised current feature, assuming (i) the smallness of the ratio between
current velocity and wave group speed, and (ii) a swell-like, highly
directional wave spectrum.
  We apply matched asymptotics to the equation governing the conservation of
wave action in the four-dimensional position--wavenumber space. The resulting
explicit formulas show that the modulations in wave action and significant wave
height past the localised current are controlled by the vorticity of the
current integrated along the primary direction of the swell.
  We assess the asymptotic predictions against numerical simulations using
WAVEWATCH III for a Gaussian vortex. We also consider vortex dipoles to
demonstrate the possibility of `vortex cloaking' whereby certain currents have
(asymptotically) no impact on the significant wave height. We discuss the role
of the ratio of the two small parameters characterising assumptions (i) and
(ii) above and show that caustics are only significant for unrealistically
large values of this ratio, corresponding to unrealistically narrow directional
spectra.

due to their ability to capture the existence of unobserved discrete states in
the dynamics of the variables under study. This result is generally obtained
thanks to the inference on states derived from the so--called Hamilton filter.
One of the open problems in this framework is the identification of the number
of states, generally fixed a priori; it is in fact impossible to apply
classical tests due to the problem of the nuisance parameters present only
under the alternative hypothesis. In this work we show, by Monte Carlo
simulations, that fuzzy clustering is able to reproduce the parametric state
inference derived from the Hamilton filter and that the typical indices used in
clustering to determine the number of groups can be used to identify the number
of states in this framework. The procedure is very simple to apply, considering
that it is performed (in a nonparametric way) independently of the data
generation process and that the indicators we use are present in most
statistical packages. A final application on real data completes the analysis.

demand from regulators to accompany decisions made by such systems with
explanations. However, a persistent gap exists between the need to execute a
meaningful right to explanation vs. the ability of Machine Learning systems to
deliver on such a legal requirement. The regulatory appeal towards ""a right to
explanation"" of AI systems can be attributed to the significant role of
explanations, part of the notion called reason-giving, in law. Therefore, in
this work we examine reason-giving's purposes in law to analyze whether reasons
provided by end-user Explainability can adequately fulfill them.
  We find that reason-giving's legal purposes include: (a) making a better and
more just decision, (b) facilitating due-process, (c) authenticating human
agency, and (d) enhancing the decision makers' authority. Using this
methodology, we demonstrate end-user Explainabilty's inadequacy to fulfil
reason-giving's role in law, given reason-giving's functions rely on its impact
over a human decision maker. Thus, end-user Explainability fails, or is
unsuitable, to fulfil the first, second and third legal function. In contrast
we find that end-user Explainability excels in the fourth function, a quality
which raises serious risks considering recent end-user Explainability research
trends, Large Language Models' capabilities, and the ability to manipulate
end-users by both humans and machines. Hence, we suggest that in some cases the
right to explanation of AI systems could bring more harm than good to end
users. Accordingly, this study carries some important policy ramifications, as
it calls upon regulators and Machine Learning practitioners to reconsider the
widespread pursuit of end-user Explainability and a right to explanation of AI
systems.

limited in solving the compositional generalization (CG) tasks, failing to
systematically generalize to unseen compositions of seen components. There is
mounting evidence that one of the reasons hindering CG is the representation of
the encoder uppermost layer is entangled. In other words, the syntactic and
semantic representations of sequences are twisted inappropriately. However,
most previous studies mainly concentrate on enhancing semantic information at
token-level, rather than composing the syntactic and semantic representations
of sequences appropriately as humans do. In addition, we consider the
representation entanglement problem they found is not comprehensive, and
further hypothesize that source keys and values representations passing into
different decoder layers are also entangled. Staring from this intuition and
inspired by humans' strategies for CG, we propose COMPSITION (Compose Syntactic
and Semantic Representations), an extension to Seq2Seq models to learn to
compose representations of different encoder layers appropriately for
generating different keys and values passing into different decoder layers
through introducing a composed layer between the encoder and decoder.
COMPSITION achieves competitive and even state-of-the-art results on two
realistic benchmarks, which empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposal.

two main challenges of blind SR in RSIs: 1) the accu-rate estimation of

on dual conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDSR). In our
work, we introduce conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM)
from two aspects: kernel estimation progress and re-construction progress,
named as the dual-diffusion. As for kernel estimation progress, conditioned on
low-resolution (LR) images, a new DDPM-based kernel predictor is constructed by
studying the invertible mapping between the kernel distribution and the latent
distribution. As for reconstruction progress, regarding the predicted
degradation kernels and LR images as conditional information, we construct a
DDPM-based reconstructor to learning the mapping from the LR images to HR

physics beyond the SM. We propose a novel, interference-based strategy to
search for top-quark FCNCs involving the $Z$ boson that has the potential to
complement traditional search strategies due to a more favourable luminosity
scaling. The strategy leverages on-shell interference between the FCNC and SM
decay of the top quark into hadronic final states. We estimate the feasibility
of the most promising case of anomalous $tZc$ couplings using Monte Carlo
simulations and a simplified detector simulation. We consider the main
background processes and discriminate the signal from the background with a
deep neural network that is parametrised in the value of the anomalous $tZc$
coupling. We present sensitivity projections for the HL-LHC and the FCC-hh. We
find an expected $95\%$ CL upper limit of
$\mathcal{B}_{\mathrm{excl}}(t\rightarrow Zc) = 6.4 \times 10^{-5}$ for the

shells N_sh=8,28,50 and 82. It turns out that the well-known shells with the
neutron numbers 20 and 126 do not show up. The present analysis is performed by
means of the relative charge radius x(N,N_sh,Z). This value is equal to the
charge radius of a given isotope over the charge radius of the isotope of the
given element with the closed neutron shell. It is shown that the values of x
form groups corresponding to different values of N_sh. Prediction for unknown
charge radius of sulfur-30 has been made.

of a Complex Adaptive System (CAS) with its environments. The tendency towards
stability can be explained by minimising free energy but high variability,

Without perturbation (increasing free energy), the system remains stuck and
unable to adapt to changing circumstances. The paper introduces the concept of

operation of one-way electric car-sharing systems. It aims to maximize the
total rental time of a fleet of electric vehicles while ensuring that all the
demands of the customer are fulfilled. In this paper, we expand the knowledge
on the complexity of the EVSP by showing that it is NP-hard to approximate it
to within a factor of $n^{1-\epsilon}$ in polynomial time, for any $\epsilon >
0$, where $n$ denotes the number of customers, unless P = NP. In addition, we
also show that the problem does not have a monotone structure, which can be
detrimental to the development of heuristics employing constructive strategies.
Moreover, we propose a novel approach for the modeling of the EVSP based on
energy flows in the network. Based on the new model, we propose a relax-and-fix
strategy and an exact algorithm that uses a warm-start solution obtained from
our heuristic approach. We report computational results comparing our
formulation with the best-performing formulation in the literature. The results
show that our formulation outperforms the previous one concerning the number of
optimal solutions obtained, optimality gaps, and computational times.
Previously, $32.7\%$ of the instances remained unsolved (within a time limit of
one hour) by the best-performing formulation in the literature, while our
formulation obtained optimal solutions for all instances. To stress our
approaches, two more challenging new sets of instances were generated, for
which we were able to solve $49.5\%$ of the instances, with an average
optimality gap of $2.91\%$ for those not solved optimally.

groups, known as the fairness problem. Recent approaches to tackle this problem
learn a latent code (i.e., representation) through disentangled representation
learning and then discard the latent code dimensions correlated with sensitive
attributes (e.g., gender). Nevertheless, these approaches may suffer from
incomplete disentanglement and overlook proxy attributes (proxies for sensitive
attributes) when processing real-world data, especially for unstructured data,
causing performance degradation in fairness and loss of useful information for
downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel fairness framework that
performs debiasing with regard to both sensitive attributes and proxy
attributes, which boosts the prediction performance of downstream task models
without complete disentanglement. The main idea is to, first, leverage
gradient-based explanation to find two model focuses, 1) one focus for
predicting sensitive attributes and 2) the other focus for predicting
downstream task labels, and second, use them to perturb the latent code that
guides the training of downstream task models towards fairness and utility
goals. We show empirically that our framework works with both disentangled and
non-disentangled representation learning methods and achieves better
fairness-accuracy trade-off on unstructured and structured datasets than
previous state-of-the-art approaches.

while the aggregate network that overlays all products is characterized by a
multitude of triadic motifs, most single-product layers feature no significant
motif, and roughly 80% of the layers feature only two motifs or less. This
result paves the way for identifying a simple ""triadic fingerprint"" of each

an underappreciated misunderstanding relevant to modelling dynamics on

embeddings are naturally adopted in many neural dynamical network models.
However, we show that embeddings tend to induce a model that fits observations
well but simultaneously has incorrect dynamical behaviours. Recognising that
previous studies narrowly focus on short-term predictions during the transient
phase of a flow, we propose three tests for correct long-term behaviour, and
illustrate how an embedding-based dynamical model fails these tests, and
analyse the causes, particularly through the lens of topological conjugacy. In
doing so, we show that the difficulties can be avoided by not using embedding.
We propose a simple embedding-free alternative based on parametrising two
additive vector-field components. Through extensive experiments, we verify that
the proposed model can reliably recover a broad class of dynamics on different

large-scale integer programming (IP) problems to (near) optimality. The
majority of cutting plane approaches rely on explicit rules to derive valid
inequalities that can separate the target point from the feasible set. Local
cuts, on the other hand, seek to directly derive the facets of the underlying
polyhedron and use them as cutting planes. However, current approaches rely on
solving Linear Programming (LP) problems in order to derive such a hyperplane.
In this paper, we present a novel generic approach for learning the facets of
the underlying polyhedron by accessing it implicitly via an enumeration oracle
in a reduced dimension. This is achieved by embedding the oracle in a variant
of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm which is capable of generating strong cutting
planes, effectively turning the enumeration oracle into a separation oracle. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a case study targeting the
multidimensional knapsack problem (MKP).

models, have received much attention and success, which pushes researchers to
explore the possibility of transforming non-sequential problems into a
sequential form. Following this thought, deep neural networks can be
represented as composite functions of a sequence of mappings, linear or
nonlinear, where each composition can be viewed as a \emph{word}. However, the
weights of linear mappings are undetermined and hence require an infinite
number of words. In this article, we investigate the finite case and
constructively prove the existence of a finite \emph{vocabulary} $V=\{\phi_i:
\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d | i=1,...,n\}$ with $n=O(d^2)$ for the universal
approximation. That is, for any continuous mapping $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to

Combined with polarization-division multiplexing and wavelength-division
multiplexing, OAM multiplexing is a promising solution for future capacity
demands. However, the practically addressable number of spatial subchannels is
severely limited by the receiver size and the rapid beam expansion with
increasing mode order and communication distance. Based on the intrinsic and
distinctive property that the divergent degree of the innermost ring of a
Laguerre-Gaussian beam is significantly slower than that of the beam
cross-section during propagation, here we propose theoretically and demonstrate
experimentally a novel communication strategy innermost ring dominated OAM
(IRD-OAM) multiplexingn that can overcome these limits and achieve up to 1238%
capacity of conventional OAM multiplexing in a canonical FSO link system
without any additional hardware modifications. Alternatively, our strategy can
also enable longer communication distance (403% of that for conventional OAM
multiplexing), or smaller receiver (26.9% in size compared to conventional OAM
multiplexing), while maintaining the same capacity as conventional OAM
multiplexing. Our work will hasten the development of future FSO communications

visual entities with natural language descriptions. Current methods either fail
to leverage the local details or are computationally expensive. What's worse,
they fail to leverage the heterogeneous concepts in data. In this paper, we
propose the Disentangled Conceptualization and Set-to-set Alignment (DiCoSA) to
simulate the conceptualizing and reasoning process of human beings. For
disentangled conceptualization, we divide the coarse feature into multiple
latent factors related to semantic concepts. For set-to-set alignment, where a
set of visual concepts correspond to a set of textual concepts, we propose an
adaptive pooling method to aggregate semantic concepts to address the partial
matching. In particular, since we encode concepts independently in only a few
dimensions, DiCoSA is superior at efficiency and granularity, ensuring
fine-grained interactions using a similar computational complexity as
coarse-grained alignment. Extensive experiments on five datasets, including
MSR-VTT, LSMDC, MSVD, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo, demonstrate that our method
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

often require post-training adjustments to enforce business rules, rectify
undesired behavior, and align with user values. These adjustments involve
operationalizing ""concepts""--dictating desired model responses to certain
inputs. However, it's difficult for a single entity to enumerate and define all

challenging, and an improper approach can create shortcuts or interfere with

  To address these challenges, we introduce CoDev, a framework that enables
multi-user interaction with the model, thereby mitigating individual
limitations. CoDev aids users in operationalizing their concepts using Large
Language Models, and relying on the principle that NLP models exhibit simpler
behaviors in local regions. Our main insight is learning a \emph{local} model
for each concept, and a \emph{global} model to integrate the original data with
all concepts. We then steer a large language model to generate instances within
concept boundaries where local and global disagree. Our experiments show CoDev
is effective at helping multiple users operationalize concepts and avoid
interference for a variety of scenarios, tasks, and models.

  Algorithms","conference",,,,"cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an effective framework for improving the breakdown point of robust
regression algorithms. Robust regression has attracted widespread attention due
to the ubiquity of outliers, which significantly affect the estimation results.
However, many existing robust least-squares regression algorithms suffer from a
low breakdown point, as they become stuck around local optima when facing
severe attacks. By expanding on the previous work, we propose a novel framework
that enhances the breakdown point of these algorithms by inserting a prior
distribution in each iteration step, and adjusting the prior distribution
according to historical information. We apply this framework to a specific
algorithm and derive the consistent robust regression algorithm with iterative
local search (CORALS). The relationship between CORALS and momentum gradient
descent is described, and a detailed proof of the theoretical convergence of
CORALS is presented. Finally, we demonstrate that the breakdown point of CORALS
is indeed higher than that of the algorithm from which it is derived. We apply
the proposed framework to other robust algorithms, and show that the improved
algorithms achieve better results than the original algorithms, indicating the
effectiveness of the proposed framework.

iterative training processes as well as face difficulties in interpreting their
predictions to users. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new
interpretable SSL model using the supervised and unsupervised Adaptive
Resonance Theory (ART) family of networks, which is denoted as SSL-ART.
Firstly, SSL-ART adopts an unsupervised fuzzy ART network to create a number of
prototype nodes using unlabeled samples. Then, it leverages a supervised fuzzy
ARTMAP structure to map the established prototype nodes to the target classes
using labeled samples. Specifically, a one-to-many (OtM) mapping scheme is
devised to associate a prototype node with more than one class label. The main
advantages of SSL-ART include the capability of: (i) performing online
learning, (ii) reducing the number of redundant prototype nodes through the OtM
mapping scheme and minimizing the effects of noisy samples, and (iii) providing
an explanation facility for users to interpret the predicted outcomes. In
addition, a weighted voting strategy is introduced to form an ensemble SSL-ART
model, which is denoted as WESSL-ART. Every ensemble member, i.e., SSL-ART,
assigns {\color{black}a different weight} to each class based on its
performance pertaining to the corresponding class. The aim is to mitigate the
effects of training data sequences on all SSL-ART members and improve the
overall performance of WESSL-ART. The experimental results on eighteen
benchmark data sets, three artificially generated data sets, and a real-world
case study indicate the benefits of the proposed SSL-ART and WESSL-ART models
for tackling pattern classification problems.

is how to anticipate accurately whether the perturbed systems will return to
the functional state after the transient or collapse. Whereas model-based
studies show that the key to addressing the challenge lies in the attracting
basins of the functional and dysfunctional states in the phase space, the
finding of the attracting basins for realistic power systems remains a
challenge, as accurate models describing the system dynamics are generally
unavailable. Here we propose a new machine learning technique, namely balanced
reservoir computing, to infer the attracting basins of a typical power system
based on measured data. Specifically, trained by the time series of a handful
of perturbation events, we demonstrate that the trained machine can predict
accurately whether the system will return to the functional state in response
to a large, random perturbation, thereby reconstructing the attracting basin of
the functional state. The working mechanism of the new machine is analyzed, and
it is revealed that the success of the new machine is attributed to the good
balance between the echo and fading properties of the reservoir network; the
effect of noisy signals on the prediction performance is also investigated, and
a stochastic-resonance-like phenomenon is observed. Finally, we demonstrate
that the new technique can be also utilized to infer the attracting basins of
coexisting attractors in typical chaotic systems.

Finally, the obtained node representation is used to learn importance ranking

different combinability-consistency trade-offs. Therefore, we propose
MotifRetro, a dynamic motif editing framework for retrosynthesis prediction

MotifRetro comprises two components: RetroBPE, which controls the
combinability-consistency trade-off, and a motif editing model, where we

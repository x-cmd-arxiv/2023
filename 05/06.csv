interferometers based on discrete single-photon detections, and demonstrate
this in a setup. Our interferometer decodes relative-phase-encoded optical
pulse pairs for quantum key distribution applications and requires no locking
laser in addition to the weak received signal. Our new simple locking scheme is
shown to produce an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamic and achieve optimal phase noise
for a given count rate. In case of wavelength drifts that arise during the
reception of Doppler-shifted satellite signals, the arm-length difference gets
continuously readjusted to keep the interferometer phase stable.

fluid dynamics, i.e., the reduction of the drag of a bluff body. We cast the
problem as a discrete-time control with continuous action space: at each time
step, an autonomous agent can set the flow rate of two jets of fluid,
positioned at the back of the body. The agent, trained with Proximal Policy
Optimization, learns an effective strategy to make the jets interact with the
vortexes of the wake, thus reducing the drag. To tackle the computational
complexity of the fluid dynamics simulations, which would make the training
procedure prohibitively expensive, we train the agent on a coarse
discretization of the domain. We provide numerical evidence that a policy
trained in this approximate environment still retains good performance when
carried over to a denser mesh. Our simulations show a considerable drag
reduction with a consequent saving of total power, defined as the sum of the
power spent by the control system and of the power of the drag force, amounting
to 40% when compared to simulations with the reference bluff body without any
jet. Finally, we qualitatively investigate the control policy learnt by the
neural network. We can observe that it achieves the drag reduction by learning
the frequency of formation of the vortexes and activating the jets accordingly,
thus blowing them away off the rear body surface.

called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives -- generation
accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multi-objective optimizer and applies
an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with
only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets

our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other

field of precision interferometry such as Advanced LIGO to yield optimal
sensitivity. Using higher-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes for the main
interferometer beam has been a topic of recent study, due to their potential
for reducing thermal noise of the test masses. It has been shown however that
higher-order HG modes are more susceptible to coupling losses into optical
cavities: the misalignment and mode mismatch induced power losses scale as
$2n+1$ and $n^{2}+n+1$ respectively with $n$ being the mode index. In this
paper we calculate analytically for the first time the alignment and mode
mismatch sensing signals for arbitrary higher-order HG modes with both the
traditional sensing schemes (using Gouy phase telescopes and quadrant
photodetectors) and the more recently proposed radio-frequency jitter-based
sensing schemes (using only single element photodiodes). We show that the
sensing signals and also the signal-to-shot noise ratios for higher-order HG
modes are larger than for the fundamental mode. In particular, the alignment
and mode mismatch sensing signals in the traditional sensing schemes scale
approximately as $\sqrt{n}$ and $n$ respectively, whereas in the jitter-based
sensing schemes they scale exactly as $2n+1$ and $n^{2}+n+1$, respectively,
which exactly matches the decrease in their respective tolerances. This
potentially mitigates the downside of higher-order HG modes for their suffering
from excessive misalignment and mode-mismatch induced power losses.

support grain growth to sizes where the particles decoupled from the gas. This
combination could lead to short-wavelength fragmentation of the solid component
in otherwise non-fragmenting gas discs, forming Earth-mass solid cores during
the Class 0/I stages of Young Stellar Object evolution. We use
three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of two-fluid
discs, in the regime where the Stokes number of the particles St>1, to study
how the formation of solid clumps depends on the disc-to-star mass ratio, the
strength of gravitational instability, and the Stokes number. Gravitational
instability of the simulated discs is sustained by local cooling. We find that
the ability of the spiral structures to concentrate solids increases with the
cooling time, and decreases with the Stokes number, while the relative
dynamical temperature between gas and dust of the particles decreases with the
cooling time and the disc-to-star mass ratio, and increases with the Stokes
number. Dust collapse occurs in a subset of high disc mass simulations,
yielding clumps whose mass is close to linear theory estimates, namely 1-10
Earth masses. Our results suggest that if planet formation occurs via this
mechanism, the best conditions correspond to near the end of the
self-gravitating phase, when the cooling time is long and the Stokes number

studies have typically focused on particles with isotropic tumbles, recent
examples exhibit ""tumble-turns"", in which particles undergo 90{\deg} tumbles
and so possess explicitly anisotropic dynamics. We study the consequences of
such tumble-turn anisotropicity at both short and long-time scales. We model
run-and-tumble-turn particles as self-propelled particles subjected to an
angular potential. Using agent-based simulations, we study the interplay of
noise and potential on the particles' trajectories, demonstrating that the
long-time effect is to alter the tumble-turn time, which governs the long-time
dynamics. In particular, when normalized by this timescale, trajectories become
independent of the underlying details of the potential. As such, we develop a
simplified continuum theory, which quantitatively agrees with agent
simulations. The hydrodynamic limit reveals that the transition to diffusive
dynamics precedes the transition to isotropic dynamics as the hydrodynamic
limit, while purely diffusive, can drive anisotropicity at intermediate times.

the possibility to gather a higher throughput, while, on the other hand,
multiple paths can also be used to transmit data redundantly. Selective
redundancy combines these two applications and thereby offers the potential to
transmit time-critical data. This paper considers scenarios where data with
real-time requirements are transmitted redundantly while at the same time,
non-critical data should make use of the aggregated throughput. A new model
called congestion window reservation is proposed, which enables an immediate
transmission of time-critical data. The performance of this method and its

However, often it is important to know whether a given property holds globally

equivalent representation of neural networks that can aid such (quantitative)
global robustness verification, it is intractable at scale. In this work, we
propose an efficient and practical anytime algorithm for generating symbolic
under-approximations of the preimage of neural networks based on linear

by partitioning the input region into subregions, where the neural network
relaxation bounds become tighter. We further employ sampling and differentiable
approximations to the volume in order to prioritize regions to split and
optimize the parameters of the relaxation, leading to faster improvement and
more compact under-approximations. Evaluation results demonstrate that our
approach is able to generate preimage approximations significantly faster than
exact methods and scales to neural network controllers for which exact preimage
generation is intractable. We also demonstrate an application of our approach

However, some models exhibited punctures on the top ceramic layer, which
altered the scratching behavior and reduced the impact of layer thickness on

resource-intensive. Our paper presents a play-and-plug module for Large
Language Models (LLMs), namely Interactive Perception Network (IPN), aiming to
achieve a LVLM by incorporating the image understanding capability into LLMs.
Previous methods incorporate visual information into LLMs with a simple visual
mapping network, where the image feature is projected into the embedding space
of LLMs via a linear layer. Such mapping network projects the image feature
once yet does not consider the interaction between the image and the human
input query. Hence, the obtained visual information with no connections with
human intention may be inadequate for LLMs to make intention-following
responses, which we term as static visual information. IPN addresses this issue
by allowing the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned with
various human instructions, which we term as the dynamic interaction between
the LLM and visual information. Specifically, IPN consists of a simple visual
mapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It also
contains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs,
performing request-based visual information interaction, and transmitting the
resulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way,
LLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request to
the request-based visual information interaction module, and generate the
response based on the interleaved multimodal information. We evaluate IPN
through extensive experiments on multimodal question answering, reasoning, and

collection of fields into latent factors that can be used as a generative
model. The technique is applied to vertical mid-sections of a cubic cell for
Rayleigh numbers in the range $[10^6, 10^8]$. We show that LDA provides a
relevant representation of the convective heat flux and displays good
generative properties. The latent factors identified by the decomposition,
called motifs, consist of localized regions of fluid. The average size of the
motifs decreases with the Rayleigh number and their spatio-temporal
characteristics vary within the cell: frequent, elongated structures are found
within the vertical boundary layers, while rounder, larger structures generally
aligned with the velocity field are observed in the entrainment zone. At the
lower Rayleigh numbers, large, infrequent structures are also present in the

0.25H from the horizontal plate and consist of elongated structures within the

quantitatively the velocity field using a shifted Legendre polynomial
decomposition. We show that the velocity field is more complex than considered

In particular, the velocity field is dominated by degrees 0 and 1, with
contributions from degree 2, and is independent of the Froude and the Weber

AGN, one manifestation of feedback is seen in gas outflows. However, it is
still not well understood whether the effect of feedback evolves with the radio
AGN life cycle. In this study, we investigate this link using the radio
spectral shape as a proxy for the evolutionary stage of the AGN. We used [OIII]
emission line spectra to trace the presence of outflows on the ionised gas.
Using a sample of uniformly selected 129 radio AGN with
$L_\textrm{1.4GHz}\approx10^{23}-10^{26}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, and a mean stacking
analysis of the [OIII] profile, we conclude that the ionised gas outflow is
linked to the radio spectral shape, and it evolves with the evolution of the
radio source. We find that sources with a peak in their radio spectra
(optically thick), on average, drive a broad outflow ($FWHM\approx1330\pm418$
km s$^{-1}$) with a velocity $v_\textrm{out}\approx 240$ km s$^{-1}$. However,
we detect no outflow in the stacked [OIII] profile of sources without a peak in
their radio spectrum. In addition, we find that individual outflow detections
are kinematically more extreme in peaked than non-peaked sources. We conclude
that radio jets are most effective at driving gas outflows when young, and the
outflow is typically short lived. Our stacking analysis shows no significant
dependence of the presence of ionised gas outflows on the radio morphology, 1.4
GHz luminosity, optical luminosity and Eddington ratio of these sources. We
also identify candidate restarted AGN in our sample, whose [OIII] profiles
suggest that they have more disturbed gas kinematics than their evolved
counterparts, although the evidence for this is tentative. Our findings support
the picture where the impact of AGN feedback changes as the source evolves, and
young radio jets interact with the ambient medium, clearing a channel of gas as
they expand.

the lack of a method to derive a suitable confidence region from the measured

One popular geometric approach is to first represent events as an energy flow

transport in two dimensions. In this paper, we advocate for representing events
in terms of a spectral function that encodes pairwise particle angles and
products of particle energies, which enables a metric distance defined in terms
of one-dimensional optimal transport. This approach has the advantage of
automatically incorporating obvious isometries of the data, like rotations
about the colliding beam axis. It also facilitates first-principles
calculations, since there are simple closed-form expressions for optimal
transport in one dimension. Up to isometries and event sets of measure zero,
the spectral representation is unique, so the metric on the space of spectral
functions is a metric on the space of events. At lowest order in perturbation
theory in electron-positron collisions, our metric is simply the summed squared
invariant masses of the two event hemispheres. Going to higher orders, we
present predictions for the distribution of metric distances between jets in
fixed-order and resummed perturbation theory as well as in parton-shower
generators. Finally, we speculate on whether the spectral approach could

a bulge+disc system, with bulges being dispersion-dominated and discs

such framework oversimplifies complexity, especially if one considers galaxy
kinematic.To address this issue we introduced with the GPU-based code
\textsc{bang} a novel approach that employs analytical potential-density pairs
as galactic components, allowing for a computationally fast, still reliable fit
of the morphological and kinematical properties of galaxies. Here we apply
\textsc{bang} to the SDSS-MaNGA survey, estimating key parameters such as mass,
radial extensions, dynamics, for both bulges and discs of +10,000 objects. We
test our methodology against a smaller subsample of galaxies independently
analysed with an orbit-based algorithm, finding agreement in the recovered
total stellar mass. We also manage to reproduce well-established scaling
relations, demonstrating how a proper dynamical modelling can result in tighter
correlations and provide corrections to standard approaches. Finally, we
propose a more general way of decomposing galaxies into ""hot"" and ""cold""
components, showing a correlation with orbit-based approaches and visually
determined morphological type. Unexpected tails in the ""hot-to-total""
mass-ratio distribution are present for galaxies of all morphologies, possibly

present the first detection of moving and decelerating radio-emitting outflows
from an X-ray binary in a globular cluster. MAXI J1848-015 is a recently
discovered transient X-ray binary in the direction of the globular cluster
GLIMPSE-C01. Using observations from the VLA, and a monitoring campaign with
the MeerKAT observatory for 500 days, we model the motion of the outflows. This
represents some of the most intensive, long-term coverage of relativistically
moving X-ray binary outflows to date. We use the proper motions of the outflows
from MAXI J1848-015 to constrain the component of the intrinsic jet speed along
the line of sight, $\beta_\textrm{int} \cos \theta_\textrm{ejection}$, to be
$=0.19\pm0.02$. Assuming it is located in GLIMPSE-C01, at 3.4 kpc, we determine
the intrinsic jet speed, $\beta_\textrm{int}=0.79\pm0.07$, and the inclination
angle to the line of sight, $\theta_\textrm{ejection}=76^\circ\pm2^{\circ}$.
This makes the outflows from MAXI J1848-015 somewhat slower than those seen
from many other known X-ray binaries. We also constrain the maximum distance to
MAXI J1848-015 to be $4.3$ kpc. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our
findings for the nature of the compact object in this system, finding that a
black hole primary is a viable (but as-of-yet unconfirmed) explanation for the
observed properties of MAXI J1848-015. If future data and/or analysis provide
more conclusive evidence that MAXI J1848-015 indeed hosts a black hole, it

gravity in the context of accelerating NUT spacetimes by utilizing Ernst's
description of stationary and axially symmetric electro-vacuum solutions. We
employ Ehlers transformations, Lie point symmetries of the Einstein field
equations, to efficiently endorse accelerating metrics with a nontrivial NUT
charge. Under this context, we begin by re-deriving the known C-metric NUT
spacetime described by Chng, Mann, and Stelea in a straightforward manner, and
in the new form of the solution introduced by Podolsk\'{y} and Vr\'{a}tn\'{y}.
Next, we construct for the first time an accelerating NUT black hole dressed
with a conformally coupled scalar field. These solutions belong to the general
class of type I spacetimes, therefore cannot be obtained from any limit of the
Pleban\'{s}ki-Demia\'{n}ski family whatsoever and their integration needs to be
carried out independently. Including Maxwell fields is certainly permitted,
however, the use of Ehlers transformations is subtle and requires further
modifications. Ehlers transformations do not only partially rotate the mass
parameter such that its magnetic component appears, but also rotate the
corresponding gauge fields. The alignment of the electromagnetic potentials can
be performed via an enhanced Ehlers transformation, but its use is proven to be
limited by the presence of acceleration. We present a
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-C-metric NUT-like black hole that correctly reproduces
the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-C-metric and Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-NUT line
elements in the corresponding limiting cases but with a misaligned
electromagnetic potential. We describe the main geometric features of these
solutions and discuss possible embeddings of our geometries in external

resolution simulations of coronal loops. The vortices are not artificially

resistive MHD simulations with the MURaM code. Studying an isolated coronal
loop in a Cartesian geometry allows us to resolve the structure of the loop
interior. We conduct a statistical analysis to determine vortex properties as a
function of height from the chromosphere into the corona. We find that the
energy injected into the loop is generated by internal coherent motions within
strong magnetic elements. A significant part of the resulting Poynting flux is
channeled through the chromosphere in vortex tubes forming a magnetic
connection between the photosphere and corona. Vortices can form contiguous
structures that reach up to coronal heights, but in the corona itself the
vortex tubes get deformed and eventually lose their identity with increasing
height. Vortices show increased upward directed Poynting flux and heating rate
both in the chromosphere and corona, but their effect becomes less pronounced
with increasing height. While vortices play an important role for the energy
transport and structuring in the chromosphere and low corona, their importance
higher up in the atmosphere is less clear since the swirls are less
distinguishable from their environment. Vortex tubes reaching the corona show a
complex relationship with the coronal emission.

This transforms the original nonlinear game theory problem to a linear

maximum value of the posteriori estimation error of the bilinear approximation

indicates that the bilinear model has more capacity to approximate the

Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2023bee in NGC~2708 ($D = 32 \pm 3$ Mpc), finding
excess flux in the first days after explosion relative to the expected
power-law rise from an expanding fireball. This deviation from typical behavior
for SNe Ia is particularly obvious in our 10-minute cadence $TESS$ light curve
and $Swift$ UV data. Compared to a few other normal SNe Ia with detected early
excess flux, the excess flux in SN 2023bee is redder in the UV and less
luminous. We present optical spectra of SN 2023bee, including two spectra
during the period where the flux excess is dominant. At this time, the spectra
are similar to those of other SNe Ia but with weaker Si II, C II and Ca II
absorption lines, perhaps because the excess flux creates a stronger continuum.
We compare the data to several theoretical models that have been proposed to
explain the early flux excess in SNe Ia. Interaction with either a nearby
companion star or close-in circumstellar material is expected to produce a
faster evolution than seen in the data. Radioactive material in the outer
layers of the ejecta, either from a double detonation explosion or simply an
explosion with a $^{56}$Ni clump near the surface, can not fully reproduce the
evolution either, likely due to the sensitivity of early UV observable to the
treatment of the outer part of ejecta in simulation. We conclude that no
current model can adequately explain the full set of observations. We find that
a relatively large fraction of nearby, bright SNe Ia with high-cadence
observations have some amount of excess flux within a few days of explosion.

economics, image classification, sports analytics, entertainment, and many
other fields. Ideally, probability predictions are (i) well calibrated, (ii)
accurate, and (iii) bold, i.e., far from the base rate of the event.
Predictions that satisfy these three criteria are informative for decision
making. However, there is a fundamental tension between calibration and
boldness, since calibration metrics can be high when predictions are overly
cautious, i.e., non-bold. The purpose of this work is to develop a hypothesis
test and Bayesian model selection approach to assess calibration, and a
strategy for boldness-recalibration that enables practitioners to responsibly
embolden predictions subject to their required level of calibration.
Specifically, we allow the user to pre-specify their desired posterior
probability of calibration, then maximally embolden predictions subject to this
constraint. We verify the performance of our procedures via simulation, then
demonstrate the breadth of applicability by applying these methods to real
world case studies in each of the fields mentioned above. We find that very
slight relaxation of calibration probability (e.g., from 0.99 to 0.95) can
often substantially embolden predictions (e.g., widening Hockey predictions'
range from .25-.75 to .10-.90)

increasingly prevalent in recent years, with tech companies like Google and
Facebook using users' personal information to deliver personalized content and

military technology to collect and analyze data for national security purposes.
In this context, surveillance capitalism involves the use of technologies like
facial recognition and social media monitoring to gather information on
individuals and groups deemed to be potential threats to national security.
This information is then used to inform military operations and
decision-making. This paper wants to analyze in a critical way the phenomenon
of surveillance capitalism, proposed under two different ethical framework
perspectives. Utilitarianism, a consequentialist ethical theory that judges
actions based on their ability to bring about the greatest amount of happiness
or pleasure for the greatest number of people, and Kantian deontology, a
non-consequentialist ethical theory that emphasizes the importance of
individual autonomy, freedom, and dignity. On one side, the utilitarian
framework enlightens how Information Technology (IT) and the features provided
offer, at first sight, all the positive perceptions to the majority of people,
happiness, entertainment, and pleasure. On the other side, the Kantian
deontology framework mostly focuses on the aspect of freedom and free will of
the individual. This topic is particularly related to the concession of
permissions to access data in change of services and the degree of influence
that manipulation performed by surveillance capitalism can generate.

achieving optimal performance across a range of categories. This study offers
valuable insights for developing effective Turkish clinical language models and

sub-types of breast cancer, it is known that overexpressed HER2s are
non-homogenously distributed on the cell membrane surface, forming HER2
clusters that consist of HER2s in close proximity to each other. One
therapeutic strategy is to disrupt this clustering behavior. However, given the
nanometer lengthscales involved, detecting these subtle changes has proven
challenging. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new fluorophore for
imaging HER2 clustering behaviour based on the organic molecule
Tetraphenylethylene (TPE). This molecule undergoes aggregation induced emission

properties of 1D moir\'e systems with respect to their periodic counterparts.
By studying an illustrative example we show that while narrow bands play a
significant role in enhancing interactions both for commensurate and
incommensurate structures, only quasiperiodicity is able to extend the ordered
phase down to an infinitesimal interaction strength. In this regime, the
quasiperiodic-enabled state has contributions from infinitely many wave
vectors. This quasi-factal regime cannot be stabilized in the commensurate case
even in the presence of a narrow band. These findings suggest that
quasiperiodicity may be a critical factor in stabilizing non-trivial ordered

(e.g., a linear classifier), the other has data, and the model is to be applied
over the data while safeguarding the privacy of both parties. In particular,
models in which the weights are quantized (e.g., to 1 or -1) gained increasing
attention lately, due to their benefits in efficient, private, or robust
computations. Traditionally, private inference has been studied from a
cryptographic standpoint, which suffers from high complexity and degraded
accuracy. More recently, Raviv et al. showed that in quantized models, an
information theoretic tradeoff exists between the privacy of the parties, and a
scheme based on a combination of Boolean and real-valued algebra was presented
which attains that tradeoff. Both the scheme and the respective bound required
the computation to be done exactly. In this work we show that by relaxing the
requirement for exact computation, one can break the information theoretic
privacy barrier of Raviv et al., and provide better privacy at the same
communication costs. We provide a scheme for such approximate computation,
bound its error, show its improved privacy, and devise a respective lower bound
for some parameter regimes.

many spectral lines that are commonly considered to be formed in the active

these spectra we identified lines whose emission was dominated by the active

displaying these pulsations. Unlike isolated WDs, accreting WDs rotate rapidly,
with spin periods comparable to or shorter than typical low-order oscillation

methods have shown promising results, their potential in extracting salient

multi-modal approach for edge deployment is another problem yet to resolve. To
resolve the issues, a knowledge distillation-based Multi-modal Mid-Fusion

fusion to resolve the Multi-modal Human Activity Recognition task efficiently.
DMFT first encodes the multi-modal input data into a unified representation.
Then the DMFT teacher model applies an attentive multi-modal spatial-temporal
transformer module that extracts the salient spatial-temporal features. A
temporal mid-fusion module is also proposed to further fuse the temporal
features. Then the knowledge distillation method is applied to transfer the

(CUQB), to solve such problems that directly exploits the composite structure
of the objective and constraint functions that we show leads substantially
improved sampling efficiency. CUQB is conceptually simple and avoids the
constraint approximations used by previous methods. Although the CUQB
acquisition function is not available in closed form, we propose a novel
differentiable stochastic approximation that enables it to be efficiently
maximized. We further derive bounds on the cumulative regret and constraint
violation. Since these bounds depend sublinearly on the number of iterations
under some regularity assumptions, we establish explicit bounds on the
convergence rate to the optimal solution of the original constrained problem.
In contrast to existing methods, CUQB further incorporates a simple
infeasibility detection scheme, which we prove triggers in a finite number of
iterations (with high probability) when the original problem is infeasible.
Numerical experiments on several test problems, including environmental model
calibration and real-time reactor optimization, show that CUQB significantly
outperforms traditional Bayesian optimization in both constrained and
unconstrained cases. Furthermore, compared to other state-of-the-art methods
that exploit composite structure, CUQB achieves competitive empirical

biased towards language semantics of the training data. Internal language model
estimation (ILME) has been proposed to mitigate this bias for autoregressive
models such as attention-based encoder-decoder and RNN-T. Typically, ILME is
performed by modularizing the acoustic and language components of the model
architecture, and eliminating the acoustic input to perform log-linear
interpolation with the text-only posterior. However, for CTC-based ASR, it is
not as straightforward to decouple the model into such acoustic and language
components, as CTC log-posteriors are computed in a non-autoregressive manner.
In this work, we propose a novel ILME technique for CTC-based ASR models. Our
method iteratively masks the audio timesteps to estimate a pseudo
log-likelihood of the internal LM by accumulating log-posteriors for only the
masked timesteps. Extensive evaluation across multiple out-of-domain datasets
reveals that the proposed approach improves WER by up to 9.8% and OOV F1-score
by up to 24.6% relative to Shallow Fusion, when only text data from target
domain is available. In the case of zero-shot domain adaptation, with no access

network (CNN) based prediction of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)
from high-pass filtered phase (HPFP) image. Methods: The proposed network
addresses two common generalization issues that arise when using a pre-trained
network to predict QSM from HPFP: a) data with unseen voxel sizes, and b) data
with unknown high-pass filter parameters. A network fine-tuning step based on a
high-pass filtering dipole convolution forward model is proposed to reduce the
generalization error of the pre-trained network. A progressive Unet
architecture is proposed to improve prediction accuracy without increasing
fine-tuning computational cost. Results: In retrospective studies using RMSE,
PSNR, SSIM and HFEN as quality metrics, the performance of both Unet and
progressive Unet was improved after physics-based fine-tuning at all voxel
sizes and most high-pass filtering cutoff frequencies tested in the experiment.
Progressive Unet slightly outperformed Unet both before and after fine-tuning.
In a prospective study, image sharpness was improved after physics-based
fine-tuning for both Unet and progressive Unet. Compared to Unet, progressive
Unet had better agreement of regional susceptibility values with reference QSM.
Conclusion: The proposed method shows improved robustness compared to the
pre-trained network without fine-tuning when the test dataset deviates from
training. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinwei1209/SWI_to_QSM/

consider the precision with which one can estimate any desired parameter
embedded in a scene's incoherent radiation with a multi-aperture imaging

beam-combination strategies of two classes: (1) multi-axial: where light from
different apertures is directed to a common focal plane, e.g., of a
segmented-aperture telescope; and (2) co-axial: where light collected at each
aperture, e.g., telescope sites of a long-baseline array, is routed to an
optical interferometer. As an example, we show an explicit calculation of the
quantum Fisher information (QFI) for estimating the angular separation between
two-point emitters using two identical apertures separated by a baseline
distance. We show that this QFI splits instructively into additive
contributions from the single apertures and from the baseline. We quantify the

capture both sources of information and discuss how similar methods could be
extended to more general imaging tasks. We discuss translating QFI-attaining

demonstrate that the intuition from the adiabatic algorithm applies to the task

drew inspiration from animals like rats and seals, just relying on whiskers to
perceive surroundings information and survive in dark and narrow environments.
Additionally, I looked to the human cochlear which can separate different

exploring the physical whisker-based reservoir computing for quick and
cost-efficient mobile robots environment perception and navigation step by
step. This research could help us understand how the compliance of the

~0.1'', 1.33 mm ALMA continuum observations of 12 compact protoplanetary disks

identify substructures in 6 of the 12 compact disks. We then compare the

substructures are detected at nearly all radii in both small and large disks.
Tentatively, we find fewer wide gaps in intermediate-sized disks with R_eff,90%
between 30 and 90 au. We perform a series of planet-disk interaction
simulations to constrain the sensitivity of our visibility-fitting approach.
Under an assumption of planet-disk interaction, we use the gap widths and
common disk parameters to calculate potential planet masses within the Taurus

masses, similar to the DSHARP sample. For 0.01 $M_J/M_\odot$ $\lesssim$

the existence of both trust and distrust relations. Although there is a wide
literature on signed social networks, where positive signs associated to the
links indicate trust, friendship, agreement, while negative signs represent
distrust, antagonism, and disagreement, very little is known about the effect
that signed interactions can have on the spreading of social behaviors when
higher-order interactions are taken into account. In this paper we focus on
processes of complex contagion, such as the adoption of social norms, where
exposure to multiple sources is needed for the contagion to occur. Complex
contagion has been recently modeled by higher-order networks, such as
simplicial complexes, which allow transmission to happen not only through the
links connecting pair of nodes, but also in group interactions, namely over
simplices of dimension larger or equal than two. Here, we introduce a model of
complex contagion on signed simplicial complexes, and we investigate the role
played by trust and distrust on the dynamics of a social contagion process. The
presence of higher-order signed structures in our model naturally induces new
infection and recovery mechanisms. Through numerical simulations and analytical
results in the mean-field approximation, we show how distrust determines the
way the system moves from a state where no individuals adopt the social
behavior, to a state where a finite fraction of the population actively spreads
it. Interestingly, the fraction of spreading individuals displays a
non-monotonic dependence on the average number of connections between
individuals. We then investigate how social balance affects social contagion,
finding that balanced triads either promote or impede contagion based on the
relative abundance of fully trusted relations.

narrow down our study to assessing and mitigating occupational stereotypes in
image search, which is a prevalent fairness issue in image retrieval. For the
assessment of stereotypes, we take gender as an indicator. We explore various
open-source and proprietary APIs for gender identification from images. With
these, we examine the extent of gender bias in top-tanked image search results
obtained for several occupational keywords. To mitigate the bias, we then
propose a fairness-aware re-ranking algorithm that optimizes (a) relevance of
the search result with the keyword and (b) fairness w.r.t genders identified.
We experiment on 100 top-ranked images obtained for 10 occupational keywords

Our experimental results show that the fairness-aware re-ranking algorithm

indicators, due to the random exploration nature and lack of systematic
explanations for their behavior, such AI-based techniques also bring
uncertainties and safety risks to the controlled system, posing an urgent need
for effective safety analysis techniques for AI-CPSs. Hence in this work, we
propose Mosaic, a model-based safety analysis framework for AI-CPSs. Mosaic
first constructs a Markov decision process (MDP) model as an abstract model of
the AI-CPS, which tries to characterize the behaviors of the original AI-CPS.
Then, based on the derived abstract model, safety analysis is designed in two
aspects: online safety monitoring and offline model-guided falsification. The
usefulness of Mosaic is evaluated on diverse and representative industry-level
AI-CPSs, the results of which demonstrate that Mosaic is effective in providing
safety monitoring to AI-CPSs and enables to outperform the state-of-the-art
falsification techniques, providing the basis for advanced safety analysis of
AI-CPSs.

  Co-Evolving RiEmannian manifolds","Accepted by ACM The Web Conference 2023 (WWW)",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Sequential interaction networks (SIN) have been commonly adopted in many
applications such as recommendation systems, search engines and social networks
to describe the mutual influence between users and items/products. Efforts on
representing SIN are mainly focused on capturing the dynamics of networks in
Euclidean space, and recently plenty of work has extended to hyperbolic
geometry for implicit hierarchical learning. Previous approaches which learn
the embedding trajectories of users and items achieve promising results.
However, there are still a range of fundamental issues remaining open. For
example, is it appropriate to place user and item nodes in one identical space
regardless of their inherent discrepancy? Instead of residing in a single fixed
curvature space, how will the representation spaces evolve when new interaction
occurs? To explore these issues for sequential interaction networks, we propose
SINCERE, a novel method representing Sequential Interaction Networks on
Co-Evolving RiEmannian manifolds. SIN- CERE not only takes the user and item
embedding trajectories in respective spaces into account, but also emphasizes
on the space evolvement that how curvature changes over time. Specifically, we
introduce a fresh cross-geometry aggregation which allows us to propagate
information across different Riemannian manifolds without breaking conformal
invariance, and a curvature estimator which is delicately designed to predict
global curvatures effectively according to current local Ricci curvatures.
Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the promising
performance of SINCERE over the state-of-the-art sequential interaction
prediction methods.

characterization of the overall system. While being representative, this
formulation may fail to model applications with high-dimensional but favorable
structures, such as the low-rank tensor representation for recommender systems.
To address this limitation, this work studies a general tensor bandits model,
where actions and system parameters are represented by tensors as opposed to
vectors, and we particularly focus on the case that the unknown system tensor
is low-rank. A novel bandit algorithm, coined TOFU (Tensor Optimism in the Face
of Uncertainty), is developed. TOFU first leverages flexible tensor regression
techniques to estimate low-dimensional subspaces associated with the system
tensor. These estimates are then utilized to convert the original problem to a
new one with norm constraints on its system parameters. Lastly, a
norm-constrained bandit subroutine is adopted by TOFU, which utilizes these
constraints to avoid exploring the entire high-dimensional parameter space.
Theoretical analyses show that TOFU improves the best-known regret upper bound
by a multiplicative factor that grows exponentially in the system order. A
novel performance lower bound is also established, which further corroborates
the efficiency of TOFU.

does not show saturation up to a magnetic field of 50 kOe where it reaches 610

monotonically as the temperature increases and becomes negligible above TC. The
giant magnetostriction in this double perovskite is suggested to originate from
large spin-orbit coupling associated with Co2+ (d7) cation. The obtained
magnetostriction value is comparable to 630 ppm in an identical composition

string with negative angle deficit $-2\pi$. The presence of the string's matter
violating null energy condition makes the wormhole static and traversable. We
study gravitational field of static sources in such a spacetime in the weak
field approximation. In particular, we discuss how a field of an oblate thin

presence. We also obtain a solution of a similar problem when both mouths of
the wormhole are located in the same space. This approximate solution if found
for the case when the distance $L$ between these mouths is much larger than the

grows with time and closed timelike curves are formed. This process inevitably
transforms such a traversable ring wormhole into a time machine. We estimate

propose DocDiff, the first diffusion-based framework specifically designed for
diverse challenging document enhancement problems, including document
deblurring, denoising, and removal of watermarks and seals. DocDiff consists of
two modules: the Coarse Predictor (CP), which is responsible for recovering the
primary low-frequency content, and the High-Frequency Residual Refinement (HRR)
module, which adopts the diffusion models to predict the residual
(high-frequency information, including text edges), between the ground-truth
and the CP-predicted image. DocDiff is a compact and computationally efficient
model that benefits from a well-designed network architecture, an optimized
training loss objective, and a deterministic sampling process with short time
steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DocDiff achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on multiple benchmark datasets, and can significantly
enhance the readability and recognizability of degraded document images.
Furthermore, our proposed HRR module in pre-trained DocDiff is plug-and-play
and ready-to-use, with only 4.17M parameters. It greatly sharpens the text
edges generated by SOTA deblurring methods without additional joint training.

and attention strategy, named JDAM. JDAM has a diffusion process and a sampling
process. The diffusion process involves the gradual diffusion of PET to
Gaussian noise by adding Gaussian noise, while MRI remains fixed. JPD of MRI
and noise-added PET was learned in the diffusion process. The sampling process
is a predictor-corrector. PET images were generated from MRI by JPD of MRI and
noise-added PET. The predictor is a reverse diffusion process and the corrector
is Langevin dynamics. Experimental results on the public Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art CycleGAN for high-field MRI (3T MRI). Finally,
synthetic PET images from the ultra-high-field (5T MRI and 7T MRI) be
attempted, providing a possibility for ultra-high-field PET-MRI imaging.

solve a distributed agreement problem since these networks receive information
from multiple sources and at different times. We make a key observation that in
most cases, the value obtained by oracle network nodes from multiple
information sources are in close proximity. We define a notion of agreement
distance and leverage the availability of a state machine replication (SMR)
service to solve this distributed agreement problem with an honest simple
majority of nodes instead of the conventional requirement of an honest super
majority of nodes. Values from multiple nodes being in close proximity,
therefore, forming a coherent cluster, is one of the keys to its efficiency.
Our asynchronous protocol also embeds a fallback mechanism if the coherent
cluster formation fails.
  Through simulations using real-world exchange data from seven prominent
exchanges, we show that even for very small agreement distance values, the
protocol would be able to form coherent clusters and therefore, can safely
tolerate up to $1/2$ fraction of Byzantine nodes. We also show that, for a
small statistical error, it is possible to choose the size of the oracle
network to be significantly smaller than the entire system tolerating up to a
$1/3$ fraction of Byzantine failures. This allows the oracle network to operate
much more efficiently and horizontally scale much better.

to capture the microscopic details of coffee matrices at particle-level and
perform fluid dynamics simulation based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
method (SPH) with the 3D reconstructured data. Information like flow
permeability and tortuosity of the matrices can be therefore obtained from our

normal pressure gradient conditions typical for espresso brewing, and can
provide an explanation for the inconsistency of permeability measurements seen
in the literature. Several types of coffee powder are further examined,
revealing their distinct microscopic details and resulting flow features. By
comparing the microCT images of pre- and post-extraction coffee matrices, it is
found that a decreasing porosity profile (from the bottom-outlet to the
top-inlet) always develops after extraction. This counterintuitive phenomenon
can be explained using a pressure-dependent erosion model proposed in our prior

state estimation problem is generally intractable as it involves integrals of
general nonlinear functions and unknown process noise covariance, resulting in
the posterior probability distribution functions lacking closed-form solutions.
This paper presents a recursive solution for joint nonlinear state estimation
and model parameters identification based on the approximate Bayesian inference
principle. The stochastic search variational inference is adopted to offer a
flexible, accurate, and effective approximation of the posterior distributions.
We make two contributions compared to existing variational inference-based
noise adaptive filtering methods. First, we introduce an auxiliary latent
variable to decouple the latent variables of dynamic state and process noise
covariance, thereby improving the flexibility of the posterior inference.
Second, we split the variational lower bound optimization into conjugate and
non-conjugate parts, whereas the conjugate terms are directly optimized that
admit a closed-form solution and the non-conjugate terms are optimized by
natural gradients, achieving the trade-off between inference speed and
accuracy. The performance of the proposed method is verified on radar target

categories for every image pixel. Recent studies adopt image patches to extract
material features. Although the trained networks can improve the segmentation
performance, their methods choose a fixed patch resolution which fails to take
into account the variation in pixel area covered by each material. In this
paper, we propose the Dynamic Backward Attention Transformer (DBAT) to
aggregate cross-resolution features. The DBAT takes cropped image patches as
input and gradually increases the patch resolution by merging adjacent patches
at each transformer stage, instead of fixing the patch resolution during
training. We explicitly gather the intermediate features extracted from
cross-resolution patches and merge them dynamically with predicted attention
masks. Experiments show that our DBAT achieves an accuracy of 86.85%, which is
the best performance among state-of-the-art real-time models. Like other
successful deep learning solutions with complex architectures, the DBAT also
suffers from lack of interpretability. To address this problem, this paper
examines the properties that the DBAT makes use of. By analysing the
cross-resolution features and the attention weights, this paper interprets how
the DBAT learns from image patches. We further align features to semantic
labels, performing network dissection, to infer that the proposed model can
extract material-related features better than other methods. We show that the

  Contradictory Safety Conditions with Application to Quadruped Robots","8 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The safety-critical control of robotic systems often must account for
multiple, potentially conflicting, safety constraints. This paper proposes
novel relaxation techniques to address safety-critical control problems in the
presence of conflicting safety conditions. In particular, Control Barrier
Function (CBFs) provide a means to encode safety as constraints in a Quadratic
Program (QP), wherein multiple safety conditions yield multiple constraints.
However, the QP problem becomes infeasible when the safety conditions cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. To resolve this potential infeasibility, we introduce
a hierarchy between the safety conditions and employ an additional variable to
relax the less important safety conditions (Relaxed-CBF-QP), and formulate a
cascaded structure to achieve smaller violations of lower-priority safety
conditions (Hierarchical-CBF-QP). The proposed approach, therefore, ensures the
existence of at least one solution to the QP problem with the CBFs while
dynamically balancing enforcement of additional safety constraints.
Importantly, this paper evaluates the impact of different weighting factors in
the Hierarchical-CBF-QP and, due to the sensitivity of these weightings in the
observed behavior, proposes a method to determine the weighting factors via a
sampling-based technique. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated
through simulations and experiments on a quadrupedal robot navigating to a goal
through regions with different levels of danger.

connect the trained Transformer-based encoder to a CNN-based decoder, to learn
the dense pixel-wise prediction in OCT segmentation. These training phases use
open-access data and thus incur no annotation costs, and the pre-trained model
can be adapted to different data and ROIs without re-training. Based on the
greedy approximation for the k-center problem, we also introduce an algorithm
for the selective annotation of the target data. We verified our method on
publicly-available and private OCT datasets. Compared to the widely-used U-Net

because the pre-training task for the generator (T5 text-to-text training) is
very similar to the fine-tuning task (generation of a query). The use of the

any cross-lingual dense retrieval method. Results from experiments on a

viable alternative to running expensive online A/B tests: it can speed up the
development of new policies, and reduces the risk of exposing customers to
suboptimal treatments. However, when the number of actions is large, or certain
actions are under-explored by the logging policy, existing estimators based on
inverse-propensity scoring (IPS) can have a high or even infinite variance.
Saito and Joachims (arXiv:2202.06317v2 [cs.LG]) propose marginalized IPS (MIPS)
that uses action embeddings instead, which reduces the variance of IPS in large

use intermediate outputs of a trained reward model to define action embeddings

recognized, so far there exists no study of systematically adapting mutation
testing techniques to general-purpose patch validation. To address this gap, we
investigate existing mutation testing techniques and recognize five classes of
acceleration techniques that are suitable for general-purpose patch validation.
Among them, mutant schemata and mutant deduplication have not been adapted to
general-purpose patch validation due to the arbitrary changes that third-party
APR approaches may introduce. This presents two problems for adaption: 1) the
difficulty of implementing the static equivalence analysis required by the
state-of-the-art mutant deduplication approach; 2) the difficulty of capturing
patches' changes to the system state at runtime.
  To overcome these problems, we propose two novel approaches: 1) execution
scheduling, which detects the equivalence between patches online, avoiding the
static equivalence analysis and its imprecision; 2) interception-based
instrumentation, which intercepts patches' changes to the system state,
avoiding a full interpreter and its overhead.
  Based on the contributions above, we implement ExpressAPR, a general-purpose
patch validator for Java that integrates all recognized classes of techniques
suitable for patch validation. Our large-scale evaluation with four APR
approaches shows that ExpressAPR accelerates patch validation by 137.1x over
plain validation or 8.8x over the state-of-the-art approach, making patch
validation no longer the time bottleneck of APR. Patch validation time for a
single bug can be reduced to within a few minutes on mainstream CPUs.

positioning system (GPS) signals, resulting in the reception of a few visible
satellites with many multipath signals. This is a significant problem that
results in unreliable positioning in urban areas. If a signal reception
condition from a certain satellite can be detected, the positioning performance
can be improved by excluding or de-weighting the multipath contaminated
satellite signal. Thus, we developed a machine-learning-based method of
classifying GPS signal reception conditions using a dual-polarized antenna. We
employed a decision tree algorithm for classification using three features, one
of which can be obtained only from a dual-polarized antenna. A machine-learning
model was trained using GPS signals collected from various locations. When the
features extracted from the GPS raw signal are input, the generated
machine-learning model outputs one of the three signal reception conditions:
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) only, line-of-sight (LOS) only, or LOS+NLOS. Multiple
testing datasets were used to analyze the classification accuracy, which was
then compared with an existing method using dual single-polarized antennas.
Consequently, when the testing dataset was collected at different locations
from the training dataset, a classification accuracy of 64.47% was obtained,
which was slightly higher than the accuracy of the existing method using dual
single-polarized antennas. Therefore, the dual-polarized antenna solution is
more beneficial than the dual single-polarized antenna solution because it has
a more compact form factor and its performance is similar to that of the other
solution.

distinguish whether an image is flipped or not. In this paper, we study feature
chirality innovatively, which shows how the statistics of deep learning models'
feature data are changed by training. We rethink the feature-level chirality
property, propose the feature chirality, and give the measure. Our analysis of
feature chirality on AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet reveals similar but surprising
results, including the prevalence of feature chirality in these models, the

Heisenberg model. A local magnetic field is applied at the edge sites to
control the degree of the ground-state entanglement. In the teleportation
protocol, an energy sender performs a projective measurement at one edge site,
while an energy receiver performs a feedback control at the other edge site
dependent on the measurement result to extract energy. We find that the energy
extracted by the receiver takes a maximum at intermediate value of the local
magnetic field. We also find that this magnetic-field behavior is almost
proportional to entropy changes due to the feedback control. The role of a
feedback control in an entropy change is discussed in terms of entanglement

  Learning","13 pages, submitted to IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.DC math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated edge learning (FEEL) is a popular distributed learning framework
for privacy-preserving at the edge, in which densely distributed edge devices
periodically exchange model-updates with the server to complete the global
model training. Due to limited bandwidth and uncertain wireless environment,
FEEL may impose heavy burden to the current communication system. In addition,
under the common FEEL framework, the server needs to wait for the slowest
device to complete the update uploading before starting the aggregation
process, leading to the straggler issue that causes prolonged communication
time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate FEEL from two aspects: i.e., 1)
performing data compression on the edge devices and 2) setting a deadline on
the edge server to exclude the straggler devices. However, undesired gradient
compression errors and transmission outage are introduced by the aforementioned
operations respectively, affecting the convergence of FEEL as well. In view of
these practical issues, we formulate a training time minimization problem, with
the compression ratio and deadline to be optimized. To this end, an
asymptotically unbiased aggregation scheme is first proposed to ensure zero
optimality gap after convergence, and the impact of compression error and
transmission outage on the overall training time are quantified through
convergence analysis. Then, the formulated problem is solved in an alternating
manner, based on which, the novel joint compression and deadline optimization
(JCDO) algorithm is derived. Numerical experiments for different use cases in
FEEL including image classification and autonomous driving show that the
proposed method is nearly 30X faster than the vanilla FedAVG algorithm, and
outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes.

suffer from high costs associated with data collection and pre-training, and
additional training process of the retrieved data from search engines. To
address the above challenges, we completely frame NER as a machine reading

ability to exploit existing data efficiently. Several prior works have been
dedicated to employing MRC-based solutions for tackling the NER problem,
several challenges persist: i) the reliance on manually designed prompts; ii)
the limited MRC approaches to data reconstruction, which fails to achieve
performance on par with methods utilizing extensive additional data. Thus, our
NER-to-MRC conversion consists of two components: i) transform the NER task
into a form suitable for the model to solve with MRC in a efficient manner; ii)
apply the MRC reasoning strategy to the model. We experiment on 6 benchmark

the language prior in visual question answering and the position bias in
machine reading comprehension (extractive question answering). Current
debiasing methods often come at the cost of significant in-distribution
performance to achieve favorable out-of-distribution generalizability, while
non-debiasing methods sacrifice a considerable amount of out-of-distribution
performance in order to obtain high in-distribution performance. Therefore, it
is challenging for them to deal with the complicated changing real-world
situations. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective novel loss
function with adaptive loose optimization, which seeks to make the best of both
worlds for question answering. Our main technical contribution is to reduce the
loss adaptively according to the ratio between the previous and current
optimization state on mini-batch training data. This loose optimization can be
used to prevent non-debiasing methods from overlearning data bias while
enabling debiasing methods to maintain slight bias learning. Experiments on the
visual question answering datasets, including VQA v2, VQA-CP v1, VQA-CP v2,

with both image and text description, is ubiquitous in e-commerce platforms and
content-sharing social media. However, little research attention has been paid
to this important application. This type of retrieval task is challenging due
to the facts: 1)~domain gap exists between query and doc. 2)~multi-modality
alignment and fusion. 3)~skewed training data and noisy labels collected from
user behaviors. 4)~huge number of queries and timely responses while the
large-scale candidate docs exist. To this end, we propose a novel scalable and
efficient image query to multi-modal retrieval learning paradigm called Mixer,
which adaptively integrates multi-modality data, mines skewed and noisy data
more efficiently and scalable to high traffic. The Mixer consists of three key
ingredients: First, for query and doc image, a shared encoder network followed
by separate transformation networks are utilized to account for their domain
gap. Second, in the multi-modal doc, images and text are not equally
informative. So we design a concept-aware modality fusion module, which
extracts high-level concepts from the text by a text-to-image attention
mechanism.
  Lastly, but most importantly, we turn to a new data organization and training
paradigm for single-modal to multi-modal retrieval: large-scale classification
learning which treats single-modal query and multi-modal doc as equivalent
samples of certain classes. Besides, the data organization follows a
weakly-supervised manner, which can deal with skewed data and noisy labels
inherited in the industrial systems. Learning such a large number of categories
for real-world multi-modality data is non-trivial and we design a specific
learning strategy for it. The proposed Mixer achieves SOTA performance on
public datasets from industrial retrieval systems.

not well incorporate the hierarchy structure but focus on the syntax features

the hierarchical tree (e.g., ""Comparison -> Contrast -> however"") rather than
flat labels (e.g., Contrast) or connectives (e.g., however). We propose a
prompt-based path prediction method to utilize the interactive information and

  Chinese Space Station survey Telescope",,,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool in modern cosmology. To
accurately measure the weak lensing signal, one has to control the systematic
bias to a small level. One of the most difficult problems is how to correct the
smearing effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) on the shape of the
galaxies. The chromaticity of PSF for a broad-band observation can lead to new
subtle effects. Since the PSF is wavelength dependent and the spectrum energy
distributions between stars and galaxies are different, the effective PSF
measured from the star images will be different from that smears the galaxies.
Such a bias is called colour bias. We estimate it in the optical bands of the
Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope from simulated PSFs, and show the
dependence on the colour and redshift of the galaxies. Moreover, due to the
spatial variation of spectra over the galaxy image, there exists another
higher-order bias, colour gradient bias. Our results show that both colour bias
and colour gradient bias are generally below $0.1$ percent in CSST. Only for
small-size galaxies, one needs to be careful about the colour gradient bias in
the weak lensing analysis using CSST data.

Lacking high-resolution and high-frequency observations, their structure and
evolution stages are not well understood at high redshifts. In this work, we
report ALMA 237 GHz continuum observation at $0.023''$ resolution and VLA 44
GHz continuum observation at $0.08''$ resolution of the radio continuum
emission from a high-redshift radio and hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at

hotspots identified by previous low-resolution VLA observations at 4.7 and 8.2
GHz and identify a radio core undetected in all previous observations. The SE
hotspot has a higher flux density than the NW one does by a factor of 6,
suggesting that there can be a Doppler boosting effect in the SE one. In this
scenario, we estimate the advance speed of the jet head, ranging from
$\sim$0.1c -- 0.3c, which yields a mildly relativistic case. The projected
linear distance between the two hotspots is $\sim13$ kpc, yielding a linear
size ($\leq20$ kpc) of a Compact-Steep-Spectrum (CSS) source. Combined with new
\black{high-frequency ($\nu_\text{obs}\geq44$ GHz) and archived low-frequency
observations ($\nu_\text{obs}\leq8.2$ GHz)}, we find that injection spectra of
both NW and SE hotspots can be fitted with a continuous injection (CI) model.
Based on the CI model, the synchrotron ages of NW and SE hotspots have an order
of $10^5$ yr, consistent with the order of magnitude $10^3 - 10^5$ yr observed
in CSS sources associated with radio AGNs at an early evolution stage. The CI
model also favors the scenario in which the double hotspots have experienced a
quiescent phase, suggesting that this RLAGN may have transient or intermittent

Prior research efforts have focused on deriving adversarial loss from

they neglect the image-text fusion module, which is the vital module of
text-to-image diffusion models, and 2) their defensive performance is unstable

every infinitesimal volume separates into a 'solid' and a 'broken' component.
The 'solid' part is the one that is capable of transferring stress, whereas the
'broken' part is advecting passively and is not able to transfer the stress. In
previous works, damage mechanics was addressed by introducing the damage
parameter affecting the elastic properties of the material. In this work, we
take a more microscopic point of view, by considering the transition from the
'solid' part, which can transfer mechanical stress, to the 'broken' part, which
consists of microscopic solid particles and does not transfer mechanical
stress. Based on this approach, we develop a thermodynamically consistent
dynamical theory for porous media including the transfer between the 'broken'

thermodynamics. This setting allows us to derive an explicit formula for the
breaking rate, i.e., the transition from the 'solid' to the 'broken' phase,
dependent on the Gibbs' free energy of each phase. Using that expression, we
derive a reduced variational model for material breaking under one-dimensional
deformations. We show that the material is destroyed in finite time, and that
the number of 'solid' strands vanishing at the singularity follows a power law.

reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks cannot imitate humans well. Training RL
models require online interactions with user simulators, while simulating
complex human policy is hard. Performances of SL-based models are restricted
because of the covariate shift problem. Specifically, a dialogue is a
sequential decision-making process where slight differences in current
utterances and actions will cause significant differences in subsequent
utterances. Therefore, the generalize ability of SL models is restricted
because statistical characteristics of training and testing dialogue data
gradually become different. This study proposed an offline imitation learning
model that learns policy from real dialogue datasets and does not require user
simulators. It also utilizes state transition information, which alleviates the
influence of the covariate shift problem. We introduced a regularization trick
to make our model can be effectively optimized. We investigated the performance
of our model on four independent public dialogue datasets. The experimental

resorted to different features in the generation process aimed at representing

guarantee such disentanglement, a separation of motion from appearance has
remained challenging, resulting in spatial distortions and temporal jittering
that break the spatio-temporal coherency. Motivated by this, we here propose
LEO, a novel framework for human video synthesis, placing emphasis on
spatio-temporal coherency. Our key idea is to represent motion as a sequence of
flow maps in the generation process, which inherently isolate motion from
appearance. We implement this idea via a flow-based image animator and a Latent
Motion Diffusion Model (LMDM). The former bridges a space of motion codes with
the space of flow maps, and synthesizes video frames in a warp-and-inpaint
manner. LMDM learns to capture motion prior in the training data by
synthesizing sequences of motion codes. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
analysis suggests that LEO significantly improves coherent synthesis of human
videos over previous methods on the datasets TaichiHD, FaceForensics and
CelebV-HQ. In addition, the effective disentanglement of appearance and motion
in LEO allows for two additional tasks, namely infinite-length human video

spherical and planar monolayers, the probability to observe a pair of
neighboring cells with certain valences depends on the topological charge of
the pair. The zero topological charge of the cell pair can increase the
probability for the cells to be the nearest neighbors. We then test and confirm
that analogous relationships take place in a more ordered spherical system with
a larger fraction of 6-valent cells, namely in the non-proliferative epithelium
(follicular system) of ascidian species oocytes. However, unlike spherical COS
cell monolayers, ascidian monolayers are prone to non-random agglomeration of
6-valent cells and have linear topological defects called scars and pleats. The
reasons for this difference in morphology are discussed. The morphological

optimization framework to integrate statistical information with traditional

constructed by moment information and makes decisions against the worst-case
distribution within the set. Although most moment-based DRO problems can be
reformulated as semidefinite programming (SDP) problems that can be solved in
polynomial time, solving high-dimensional SDPs is still time-consuming. Unlike
existing approximation approaches that first reduce the dimensionality of
random parameters and then solve the approximated SDPs, we propose an optimized
dimensionality reduction (ODR) approach. We first show that the ranks of the
matrices in the SDP reformulations are small, by which we are then motivated to
integrate the dimensionality reduction of random parameters with the subsequent
optimization problems. Such integration enables two outer and one inner
approximations of the original problem, all of which are low-dimensional SDPs
that can be solved efficiently. More importantly, these approximations can
theoretically achieve the optimal value of the original high-dimensional SDPs.

performance, they have limitations in simultaneously addressing the task of
brightening low light and removing rain. Furthermore, using a cascade approach,
such as ``deraining followed by low-light enhancement'' or vice versa, may lead
to difficult-to-handle rain patterns or excessively blurred and overexposed
images. To overcome these limitations, we propose an end-to-end network called
$L^{2}RIRNet$ which can jointly handle low-light enhancement and deraining. Our
network mainly includes a Pairwise Degradation Feature Vector Extraction
Network (P-Net) and a Restoration Network (R-Net). P-Net can learn degradation
feature vectors on the dark and light areas separately, using contrastive
learning to guide the image restoration process. The R-Net is responsible for
restoring the image. We also introduce an effective Fast Fourier - ResNet
Detail Guidance Module (FFR-DG) that initially guides image restoration using
detail image that do not contain degradation information but focus on texture
detail information. Additionally, we contribute a dataset containing synthetic
and real-world low-light-rainy images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our $L^{2}RIRNet$ outperforms existing methods in both synthetic and complex
real-world scenarios.

  Such a blend of two geometric models provides us with a handy way to describe

Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We modeled the nine observed transits and
the out-of-phase variations, including Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal variations,
and the reflection effect. We also incorporated ground-based photometry from
the MuSCAT2 imager installed at the 1.52 m Telescopio Carlos Sanchez in the

$4.66631 \pm 0.00011$ days, with a radius of $1.32 \pm 0.14$ R$_J$ and a mass
of $11.5 \pm 10.3$ M$_J$ (from the ellipsoidal effect), making it consistent
with either a brown dwarf or a giant planet. As HD 31221 is a rapid rotator ($v
\sin I_\star = 175.31 \pm 1.74$ km s$^{-1}$), we deduced the spin-orbit
misalignment to be $\lambda = -121.6 \pm 14.4^\circ$ and $I_\star = 55.9 \pm
11.3^\circ$. The phase curve is dominated by the reflection effect, with a
geometric albedo of $1.58 \pm 0.50$. We also found evidence that HD 31221 is a
$\delta$ Scuti/$\gamma$ Doradus hybrid pulsator. There are three cases for
which the $3$rd, $85$th, and $221$st orbital harmonics almost exactly coincide
with peaks in the Fourier spectrum of the star, hinting at tidally perturbed
stellar oscillations. HD 31221 b is the third substellar object that is found
to be disrupting the pulsations of its host, following HAT-P-2 and WASP-33.
Additional photometric observations by CHEOPS and/or PLATO can be used to
further constrain its mass and provide a more in-depth analysis of its

central supermassive black hole due to the effect of viscosity. AGN disks
provide a dense environment for supernova (SN) explosions, which inevitably
involve ejecta-disk interactions. In this paper, we investigate the light

fundamental energy source of $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$--$^{56} \mathrm{Co}$--$^{56}

produced during interactions may contribute significantly to the observed flux.
If the stellar winds manage to create a cavity surrounded by a shell near the

expected. We present various SN LCs from different types of progenitors and
find that the SN LCs are dominated by the radiation of ejecta-disk

that when an event camera is in motion, changes in reflectivity and geometric

LiDAR. Our proposed method leverages the edges extracted from events and point

nematic droplets, in the regime where the passive phase is isotropic. We show
that activity leads to the emergence of nematic order and of spontaneous
rotation in both two and three dimensions. In 2D the rotation is caused by the
formation of a chiral $+1$ defect at the center of the drop. With increasing
activity the droplet deforms to an ellipse, and then to a rotating annulus.
Growing droplets form extended active arms which loop around to produce holes.
In 3D the rotation is due to a disclination which loops away from and back to
the surface, defining the rotation axis. In the bulk the disclination loop ends
at a skyrmion. Active extensile flows deform the droplet to an oblate
ellipsoid, contractile flows elongate it along the rotation axis. We compare
our results to examples of cellular rotation in living systems.

recent popular analytical method by tackling the master equation, we resolve
the control problem in a certain proper Hilbert subspace of the whole space of

global-in-time solvability and extends the previous works of [7,11] which only
dealt with quadratic cost functionals in control; the problem is linked to the
global solvability of the Hilbert-space-valued forward-backward stochastic
differential equation (FBSDE), which is solved by variational techniques here.
We also rely on the Jacobian flow of the solution to this FBSDE to establish
the regularities of the value function, including its linearly functional
differentiability, which leads to the classical well-posedness of the Bellman
equation. Together with the linear functional derivatives and the gradient of
the linear functional derivatives of the solution to the FBSDE, we also obtain
the classical well-posedness of the master equation.

large number of labeled training samples must be provided for a sea-land
clutter classifier. In practical engineering applications, it is relatively
easy to obtain label-free sea-land clutter samples. However, the labeling
process is extremely cumbersome and requires expertise in the field of OTHR. To
solve this problem, we propose an improved generative adversarial network,
namely weighted loss semi-supervised generative adversarial network (WL-SSGAN).
Specifically, we propose a joint feature matching loss by weighting the middle
layer features of the discriminator of semi-supervised generative adversarial
network. Furthermore, we propose the weighted loss of WL-SSGAN by linearly
weighting standard adversarial loss and joint feature matching loss. The
semi-supervised classification performance of WL-SSGAN is evaluated on a
sea-land clutter dataset. The experimental results show that WL-SSGAN can
improve the performance of the fully supervised classifier with only a small
number of labeled samples by utilizing a large number of unlabeled sea-land
clutter samples. Further, the proposed weighted loss is superior to both the
adversarial loss and the feature matching loss. Additionally, we compare
WL-SSGAN with conventional semi-supervised classification methods and
demonstrate that WL-SSGAN achieves the highest classification accuracy.

halo field in the very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] < -2.0) regime, comprising up to
~ 20% of the fraction of the N-rich stars below [Fe/H] = -2.5, hinting that

training data, leading to poor performance on out-of-distribution data. A
biased dataset can be divided, according to biased features, into bias-aligned
samples (i.e., with biased features) and bias-conflicting samples (i.e.,
without biased features). Recent debiasing works typically assume that no bias
label is available during the training phase, as obtaining such information is
challenging and labor-intensive. Following this unsupervised assumption,
existing methods usually train two models: a biased model specialized to learn
biased features and a target model that uses information from the biased model
for debiasing. This paper first presents experimental analyses revealing that
the existing biased models overfit to bias-conflicting samples in the training
data, which negatively impacts the debiasing performance of the target models.
To address this issue, we propose a straightforward and effective method called
\textit{Echoes}, which trains a biased model and a target model with a
different strategy. We construct an ""echo chamber"" environment by reducing the
weights of samples which are misclassified by the biased model, to ensure the
biased model fully learns the biased features without overfitting to the
bias-conflicting samples. The biased model then assigns lower weights on the
bias-conflicting samples. Subsequently, we use the inverse of the sample
weights of the biased model as the sample weights for training the target
model. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior debiasing results
compared to the existing baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

into the same NAR masked tokens recovering task. In this way, DDM can rely on
BART to perform denoising, which can benefit from both the rich pre-learned

such as medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and agriculture, owing to its
ability to detect subtle differences in physical properties through high
spectral resolution. However, hyperspectral images (HSIs) are often quite noisy
because of narrow band spectral filtering. To reduce the noise in HSI data
cubes, both model-driven and learning-based denoising algorithms have been
proposed. However, model-based approaches rely on hand-crafted priors and
hyperparameters, while learning-based methods are incapable of estimating the
inherent degradation patterns and noise distributions in the imaging procedure,
which could inform supervised learning. Secondly, learning-based algorithms
predominantly rely on CNN and fail to capture long-range dependencies,
resulting in limited interpretability. This paper proposes a
Degradation-Noise-Aware Unfolding Network (DNA-Net) that addresses these
issues. Firstly, DNA-Net models sparse noise, Gaussian noise, and explicitly
represent image prior using transformer. Then the model is unfolded into an
end-to-end network, the hyperparameters within the model are estimated from the
noisy HSI and degradation model and utilizes them to control each iteration.
Additionally, we introduce a novel U-Shaped Local-Non-local-Spectral
Transformer (U-LNSA) that captures spectral correlation, local contents, and
non-local dependencies simultaneously. By integrating U-LNSA into DNA-Net, we
present the first Transformer-based deep unfolding HSI denoising method.
Experimental results show that DNA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
and the modeling of noise distributions helps in cases with heavy noise.

where turbulence is generated by instabilities arising from a sheared
buoyancy-driven counterflow at Reynolds numbers $Re \approx 300-5000$, tilt

distinct types of turbulence and mixing: laminarizing, braided, overturning,
granular and unstructured, as well as some intermediate types. The ratio of
time spent in each cluster varies gradually across the $(Re,\theta)$ space. At
intermediate values of $Re\,\theta$, intermittent turbulence cycles between

transform the model into a system, where the extinction steady state is
represented by up to three distinct steady states, whose existence is
determined by the values of appropriate Lambert W functions. We investigate how
stability of extinction and coexistence steady states is affected by the rate
of predation, predator fecundity, and the parameter characterising the strength
of functional response. The results suggest that the extinction steady state
can be stable for sufficiently high predation rate and for sufficiently small
predator fecundity. Moreover, in certain parameter regimes, a stable extinction
steady state can coexist with a stable prey-only equilibrium or with a stable
coexistence equilibrium, and it is rather the initial conditions that determine
whether prey and predator populations will be maintained at some steady level,
or both of them will become extinct. Another possibility is for coexistence
steady state to be unstable, in which case sustained periodic oscillations
around it are observed. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the
behaviour for all dynamical regimes, and in each case a corresponding phase
plane of the transformed system is presented to show a correspondence with

shifted laterally in space to illuminate a new area of the sample while
ensuring there is sufficient overlap. Far-field Ptychography occurs when there

pipelining by separating request and response transactions. Each
randomly-selected inference committee commits and reveals the inference
results, and upon reaching an agreement through a smart contract, then the
requested operation is executed using the consensus result. Additionally, BRAIN
carries out training by employing a randomly-selected training committee. They
submit commit and reveal transactions along with their respective scores,
enabling local model aggregation based on the median value of the scores.
Experimental results demonstrate that BRAIN delivers considerably higher

Recently, some studies have proposed the semi-supervised federated learning
setting to handle the commonly seen real-world scenarios with labeled data on
the server and unlabeled data on the clients. However, existing methods still
face challenges such as high communication costs, training pressure on the
client devices, and distribution differences among the server and the clients.
In this paper, we introduce the powerful pre-trained diffusion models into
federated learning and propose FedDISC, a Federated Diffusion Inspired
Semi-supervised Co-training method, to address these challenges. Specifically,
we first extract prototypes from the labeled data on the server and send them
to the clients. The clients then use these prototypes to predict pseudo-labels
of the local data, and compute the cluster centroids and domain-specific
features to represent their personalized distributions. After adding noise, the
clients send these features and their corresponding pseudo-labels back to the
server, which uses a pre-trained diffusion model to conditionally generate
pseudo-samples complying with the client distributions and train an aggregated
model on them. Our method does not require local training and only involves
forward inference on the clients. Our extensive experiments on DomainNet,
Openimage, and NICO++ demonstrate that the proposed FedDISC method effectively
addresses the one-shot semi-supervised problem on Non-IID clients and
outperforms the compared SOTA methods. We also demonstrate through
visualization that it is of neglectable possibility for FedDISC to leak
privacy-sensitive information of the clients.

form \[ c(x_1, x_2, x_3) = c_0 \left(1 + \left(
\frac{x_1}{\ell}\right)_{+}^\alpha \right)^{-1/2}, \] for $\alpha > 0$ not
necessarily integer. We first focus on the case of one spatial dimension and a
harmonic time dependence. We define the reflection coefficient $R$ from a
limiting absorption principle. We provide an exact formula for $R$ in terms of
the solution to a Volterra equation. We obtain the asymptotic limit of this
coefficient in the large $\ell \omega / c_0$ regime as \[ R =
\frac{\Gamma(\alpha + 1)}{(2 i)^{\alpha + 2}} \left( \frac{c_0}{\ell \omega}
\right)^{\alpha} + \mbox{lower order terms.} \] The amplitude is proportional
to $\omega^{-\alpha}$, and the phase rotation behavior is obtained from the
$i^{-(\alpha+2)}$ factor. The proof method does not rely on representing the
solution by special functions, since $\alpha > 0$ is general.
  In the multi-dimensional layered case, we obtain a similar result where the
nondimensional variable $\ell \omega / c_0$ is modified to account for the
angle of incidence. The asymptotic analysis now requires the waves to be
non-glancing. The resulting reflection coefficient can now be interpreted as a
Fourier multiplier of order $- \alpha$.
  In practice, the knowledge of the dependency of both the amplitude and the
phase of $R$ on $\omega$ and $\alpha$ might be able to inform the kind of
signal processing needed to characterize the fractional nature of reflectors,
for instance in geophysics.

performance metric of cross-modal image retrieval systems, which is critical to
user experience. Existing solutions for diversity-aware image retrieval either
explicitly post-process the raw retrieval results from standard retrieval
systems or try to learn multi-vector representations of images to represent
their diverse semantics. However, neither of them is good enough to balance
relevance and diversity. On the one hand, standard retrieval systems are
usually biased to common semantics and seldom exploit diversity-aware
regularization in training, which makes it difficult to promote diversity by
post-processing. On the other hand, multi-vector representation methods are not
guaranteed to learn robust multiple projections. As a result, irrelevant images
and images of rare or unique semantics may be projected inappropriately, which
degrades the relevance and diversity of the results generated by some typical
algorithms like top-k. To cope with these problems, this paper presents a new
method called CoLT that tries to generate much more representative and robust
representations for accurately classifying images. Specifically, CoLT first
extracts semantics-aware image features by enhancing the preliminary
representations of an existing one-to-one cross-modal system with
semantics-aware contrastive learning. Then, a transformer-based token
classifier is developed to subsume all the features into their corresponding
categories. Finally, a post-processing algorithm is designed to retrieve images
from each category to form the final retrieval result. Extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets Div400 and Div150Cred show that CoLT can effectively
boost diversity, and outperforms the existing methods as a whole (with a higher

climate conditions. With the increasing prevalence of renewable energy sources,
the interdependence between energy and climate systems has become even
stronger. This study examines the impact of different spatial resolutions in
climate modeling on energy grid reliability assessment, with the Texas
interconnection between 2033 and 2043 serving as a pilot case study. Our
preliminary findings indicate that while low-resolution climate simulations can
provide a rough estimate of system reliability, high-resolution simulations can
provide more informative assessment of low-adequacy extreme events.
Furthermore, both high and low-resolution assessments suggest the need to
prepare for severe blackout events in winter due to extremely low temperatures.

  Multi-Antenna Covert Communications: Analysis and Optimization","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2305.03991",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the multi-antenna covert communications assisted by a
simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface
(STAR-RIS). In particular, to shelter the existence of covert communications
between a multi-antenna transmitter and a single-antenna receiver from a
warden, a friendly full-duplex receiver with two antennas is leveraged to make
contributions where one antenna is responsible for receiving the transmitted
signals and the other one transmits the jamming signals with a varying power to
confuse the warden. Considering the worst case, the closed-form expression of
the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at the warden is derived and
utilized in a covert constraint to guarantee the system performance. Then, we
formulate an optimization problem maximizing the covert rate of the system
under the covertness constraint and quality of service (QoS) constraint with
communication outage analysis. To jointly design the active and passive
beamforming of the transmitter and STAR-RIS, an iterative algorithm based on
semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and Dinkelbachs algorithm is proposed to
effectively solve the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show
that the proposed STAR-RIS-assisted scheme highly outperforms the case with
conventional RIS, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
as well as the superiority of STAR-RIS in guaranteeing the covertness of
wireless communications.

Yi Qi Tong Qiao Pill (YQTQP) in the treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR), as
well as establish a paradigm for the researches on traditional Chinese medicine

TCM-related and disease-related databases, target profiles of compounds in
YQTQP were calculated through network-based algorithms and holistic targets of
TQTQP was constructed. Network target analysis was performed to explore the
potential mechanisms of YQTQP in the treatment of AR and the mechanisms were
classified into different modules according to their biological functions.
Besides, animal and clinical experiments were conducted to validate our
findings inferred from Network target analysis. Results: Network target
analysis showed that YQTQP targeted 12 main pathways or biological processes
related to AR, represented by those related to IL-4, IFN-{\gamma}, TNF-{\alpha}
and IL-13. These results could be classified into 3 biological modules,
including regulation of immune and inflammation, epithelial barrier disorder
and cell adhesion. Finally, a series of experiments composed of animal and
clinical experiments, proved our findings and confirmed that YQTQP could
improve related symptoms of AR, like permeability of nasal mucosa epithelium.
Conclusion: A combination of Network target analysis and the experimental
validation indicated that YQTQP was effective in the treatment of AR and might
provide a new insight on revealing the mechanism of TCM against diseases.

application of several recently proposed code-based LMs. We demonstrate the

a scaling inspired by the normalized Laplacian (NL) for graphs that can greatly
improve the quality of a non-negative matrix factorization. The results
parallel those in the spectral graph clustering work of \cite{Priebe:2019},
where the authors proved adjacency spectral embedding (ASE) spectral clustering
was more likely to discover core-periphery partitions and Laplacian Spectral
Embedding (LSE) was more likely to discover affinity partitions. In text
analysis non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is typically used on a matrix
of co-occurrence ``contexts'' and ``terms"" counts. The matrix scaling inspired
by LSE gives significant improvement for text topic models in a variety of
datasets. We illustrate the dramatic difference a matrix scalings in NMF can
greatly improve the quality of a topic model on three datasets where human
annotation is available. Using the adjusted Rand index (ARI), a measure cluster
similarity we see an increase of 50\% for Twitter data and over 200\% for a
newsgroup dataset versus using counts, which is the analogue of ASE. For clean

40\% improvement over ASE. We conclude with some analysis of this phenomenon
and some connections of this scaling with other matrix scaling methods.

which integrates latent detailed semantics from the text to enhance
fine-grained semantic representations. Specifically, (1) we use scene graphs in
order to pay more attention to the detailed semantic learning in the text and
fully explore structured knowledge between fine-grained semantics, and (2) we
utilize the knowledge-enhanced framework with the help of the scene graph to
make full use of representations of structured knowledge. To verify the

Numerical results show that Structure-CLIP can often achieve state-of-the-art

reduces quantum fragmentation to a classical one with the resulting stationary

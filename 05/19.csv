facto encoder architecture for speech processing due to its superior
performance in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR),
speech translation (ST) and spoken language understanding (SLU). Recently, a
new encoder called E-Branchformer has outperformed Conformer in the LibriSpeech
ASR benchmark, making it promising for more general speech applications. This
work compares E-Branchformer and Conformer through extensive experiments using
different types of end-to-end sequence-to-sequence models. Results demonstrate
that E-Branchformer achieves comparable or better performance than Conformer in
almost all evaluation sets across 15 ASR, 2 ST, and 3 SLU benchmarks, while
being more stable during training. We will release our training configurations
and pre-trained models for reproducibility, which can benefit the speech

on the sentence-level retrieval and combination paradigm (retrieval of similar

advantage of the high-quality retrieved summary tokens on the decoder side. In
this paper, we explore a fine-grained token-level retrieval-augmented mechanism

videos into spoken language texts directly without intermediate
representations. It has been a challenging task due to the modality gap between
sign videos and texts and the data scarcity of labeled data. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a novel Cross-modality Data Augmentation (XmDA)
framework to transfer the powerful gloss-to-text translation capabilities to
end-to-end sign language translation (i.e. video-to-text) by exploiting pseudo
gloss-text pairs from the sign gloss translation model. Specifically, XmDA
consists of two key components, namely, cross-modality mix-up and
cross-modality knowledge distillation. The former explicitly encourages the
alignment between sign video features and gloss embeddings to bridge the
modality gap. The latter utilizes the generation knowledge from gloss-to-text
teacher models to guide the spoken language text generation. Experimental
results on two widely used SLT datasets, i.e., PHOENIX-2014T and CSL-Daily,
demonstrate that the proposed XmDA framework significantly and consistently
outperforms the baseline models. Extensive analyses confirm our claim that XmDA
enhances spoken language text generation by reducing the representation
distance between videos and texts, as well as improving the processing of
low-frequency words and long sentences.

for machine learning. Instead of training the network to an observed training
set, a fixed model is pre-trained offline on small, simulated training sets
from a variety of tasks. The pre-trained model is then used to infer class
probabilities in-context on fresh training sets with arbitrary size and
distribution. Empirically, PFNs achieve state-of-the-art performance on tasks
with similar size to the ones used in pre-training. Surprisingly, their
accuracy further improves when passed larger data sets during inference. This
article establishes a theoretical foundation for PFNs and illuminates the
statistical mechanisms governing their behavior. While PFNs are motivated by
Bayesian ideas, a purely frequentistic interpretation of PFNs as pre-tuned, but
untrained predictors explains their behavior. A predictor's variance vanishes
if its sensitivity to individual training samples does and the bias vanishes
only if it is appropriately localized around the test feature. The transformer
architecture used in current PFN implementations ensures only the former. These
findings shall prove useful for designing architectures with favorable
empirical behavior.

expected to be unified for human-like machine intelligence. Most existing work
considers how to combine existing logical and statistical systems. However,
there is no theory of inference so far explaining how basic approaches to
statistical learning and logical reasoning stem from a common principle.
Inspired by the fact that much empirical work in neuroscience suggests Bayesian
(or probabilistic generative) approaches to brain function including learning
and reasoning, we here propose a simple Bayesian model of logical reasoning and
statistical learning. The theory is statistically correct as it satisfies
Kolmogorov's axioms, is consistent with both Fenstad's representation theorem
and maximum likelihood estimation and performs exact Bayesian inference with a
linear-time complexity. The theory is logically correct as it is a data-driven
generalisation of uncertain reasoning from consistency, possibility,
inconsistency and impossibility. The theory is correct in terms of machine
learning as its solution to generation and prediction tasks on the MNIST
dataset is not only empirically reasonable but also theoretically correct
against the K nearest neighbour method. We simply model how data causes
symbolic knowledge in terms of its satisfiability in formal logic. Symbolic
reasoning emerges as a result of the process of going the causality forwards
and backwards. The forward and backward processes correspond to an
interpretation and inverse interpretation in formal logic, respectively. The
inverse interpretation differentiates our work from the mainstream often
referred to as inverse entailment, inverse deduction or inverse resolution. The
perspective gives new insights into learning and reasoning towards human-like
machine intelligence.

of both the incompressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) and turbulent

the prediction of the flow statistics including the velocity spectrum, the

renormalization group invariant ratios with leading-twist factorization formula

next-next-to-leading order (NNLO) to extract Mellin moments of GPDs, which are
consistent with renormalization-group improved results. We compare our

carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is essential for modeling graphene and CNT-based
nanoelectromechanical systems. This work proposes a new continuum contact model
to study interlayer interactions between curved graphene sheets. The continuum
model is calibrated and validated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
These are carried out employing the reactive empirical bond order
(REBO)+Lennard-Jones (LJ) to model the interactions within a sheet, while the
LJ, Kolmogorov-Crespi (KC), and Lebedeva potentials are used to model the
interactions between sheets. The continuum contact model is formulated for
separation distances greater than 0.29nm, when sheet deformations are
sufficiently small and do not affect the sheet interactions substantially. This
allows to treat the master contact surface as rigid, thus simplifying the
contact formulation greatly. The model calibration is conducted systematically
for a sequence of different stackings using existing and newly proposed ansatz
functions. The calibrated continuum model is then implemented in a curvilinear
finite element (FE) shell formulation to investigate the pull-out and twisting
interactions between co-axial CNTs. The resisting pull-out forces and torques
depend strongly on the chirality of the considered CNTs. The absolute
differences between FE and MD results are very small, and can be attributed to
model assumptions and loading conditions.

Here, we report the design and implementation of an autonomous instrument for

highly automated sputtering reactor custom-controlled by Python, optical
emission spectroscopy (OES), and Bayesian optimization algorithm. We modeled
film composition, measured by x-ray fluorescence, as a linear function of
emission lines monitored during the co-sputtering from elemental Zn and Ti
targets in N$_2$ atmosphere. A Bayesian control algorithm, informed by OES,
navigates the space of sputtering power to fabricate films with user-defined

Zn$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$N$_y$ films with deviations from the targeted cation

that the proposed approach can reliably synthesize thin films with specific
composition and minimal human interference. Moreover, the proposed method can
be extended to more difficult synthesis experiments where plasma intensity

large-scale responses from existing trained models efficiently via
off-the-shelf distilling and compressing methods, and the post-evaluation stage

  2023 Conference. (https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/)",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  What are the computational foundations of social grouping? Traditional
approaches to this question have focused on verbal reasoning or simple
(low-dimensional) quantitative models. In the real world, however, social
preferences emerge when high-dimensional learning systems (brains and bodies)
interact with high-dimensional sensory inputs during an animal's embodied
interactions with the world. A deep understanding of social grouping will
therefore require embodied models that learn directly from sensory inputs using
high-dimensional learning mechanisms. To this end, we built artificial neural
networks (ANNs), embodied those ANNs in virtual fish bodies, and raised the
artificial fish in virtual fish tanks that mimicked the rearing conditions of
real fish. We then compared the social preferences that emerged in real fish
versus artificial fish. We found that when artificial fish had two core
learning mechanisms (reinforcement learning and curiosity-driven learning),
artificial fish developed fish-like social preferences. Like real fish, the
artificial fish spontaneously learned to prefer members of their own group over
members of other groups. The artificial fish also spontaneously learned to
self-segregate with their in-group, akin to self-segregation behavior seen in
nature. Our results suggest that social grouping can emerge from three
ingredients: (1) reinforcement learning, (2) intrinsic motivation, and (3)
early social experiences with in-group members. This approach lays a foundation
for reverse engineering animal-like social behavior with image-computable
models, bridging the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and social
preferences.

neutrino mass, asymmetric dark matter, baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and
the recently reported W-mass anomaly by CDF-II collaboration. We extend the
standard model with a vector-like singlet lepton ($\chi$) and a hypercharge
zero scalar triplet ($\Delta$) in addition to three hypercharge zero triplet
fermions($\Sigma_i~,i=1,2,3$). A $Z_2$ symmetry is imposed under which $\chi$
and $\Delta$ are odd, while all other particles are even. As a result, the
lightest $Z_2$ odd particle $\chi$ behaves as a candidate of dark matter. In
the early Universe, the CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy triplet
fermions to the Standard Model lepton ($L$) and Higgs ($H$) generate a net
lepton asymmetry, while that of triplet fermions to $\chi$ and $\Delta$
generate a net asymmetric dark matter. The lepton asymmetry is converted to the
required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via the electroweak sphalerons, while
the asymmetry in $\chi$ remains as a dark matter relic that we observe today.
We introduce a singlet scalar $\phi$, with mass $m_\phi < m_\chi$, which not
only assists to deplete the symmetric component of $\chi$ through the
annihilation process: $\bar{\chi} \chi \to \phi \phi$ but also paves a path to
detect dark matter $\chi$ at direct search experiments through $\phi-H$ mixing.
The $Z_2$ symmetry is broken softly resulting in an unstable asymmetric dark
matter with mass ranging from a few MeV to a few tens of GeV. The softly broken
$Z_2$ symmetry also induces a vacuum expectation value (vev) of $\Delta$ due to
which the asymmetry in $\Delta$ disappears. Moreover, the vev of $\Delta$
enhances the W-boson mass as reported by CDF-II collaboration with $7\sigma$
statistical significance, while keeping the $Z$-boson mass intact.

structural results for modules that are intersection flat/Ohm-Rush by
exhibiting intimate connections between these notions and the seminal work of
Raynaud and Gruson on Mittag-Leffler modules. In particular, we develop a
theory of Ohm-Rush modules that is parallel to the theory of Mittag-Leffler
modules. Our motivation for doing so is that the Ohm-Rush condition is weaker
than intersection flatness, and it will be shown in future work that one only
needs the Ohm-Rush property of Frobenius on an excellent regular ring to prove
the existence of test elements for homomorphic images of the ring. We also
obtain descent and local-to-global results for intersection flat/Ohm-Rush
modules. Our investigations reveal a pleasing picture for flat modules over a
complete local ring, in which case many otherwise distinct properties coincide.
Using these results, we characterize when a regular local ring has intersection
flat Frobenius in terms of a purity condition on the relative Frobenius of the
completion map, we provide a new characterization of excellence for DVRs in
prime characteristic, we prove new cases of intersection flatness of Frobenius,
we prove descent and ascent results for intersection flatness and Ohm-Rush
properties for Frobenius, and we show that proving the existence of test
elements for homomorphic images of excellent regular rings reduces to
exhibiting openness of pure loci for certain simple module maps. We study this
openness of loci problem in a special case and show that the Frobenius of any
excellent regular ring of prime characteristic is close to being Ohm-Rush.

constructing $\mathrm{E}(n)$-equivariant networks. We identify and study the
$\textit{Clifford group}$, a subgroup inside the Clifford algebra, whose
definition we slightly adjust to achieve several favorable properties.
Primarily, the group's action forms an orthogonal automorphism that extends
beyond the typical vector space to the entire Clifford algebra while respecting
the multivector grading. This leads to several non-equivalent
subrepresentations corresponding to the multivector decomposition. Furthermore,
we prove that the action respects not just the vector space structure of the
Clifford algebra but also its multiplicative structure, i.e., the geometric
product. These findings imply that every polynomial in multivectors, including
their grade projections, constitutes an equivariant map with respect to the
Clifford group, allowing us to parameterize equivariant neural network layers.
Notable advantages are that these layers operate directly on a vector basis and
elegantly generalize to any dimension. We demonstrate, notably from a single
core implementation, state-of-the-art performance on several distinct tasks,

Translating documents requires a deeper understanding of the structure and

conventional sentence-level MT evaluation benchmarks inadequate for evaluating
the performance of context-aware MT systems. This paper presents a new dataset

covering 15,095 entity mentions in both languages. Using these annotations, we
systematically investigate the similarities and differences between the
discourse structures of source and target languages, and the challenges they
pose to MT. We discover that MT outputs differ fundamentally from human
translations in terms of their latent discourse structures. This gives us a new
perspective on the challenges and opportunities in document-level MT. We make

sneutrinos, MSSM neutralinos, axinos, or axions. Cosmic strings from

gravitational wave background from cosmic string loops has a spectrum different
from the one in the conventional Abelian-Higgs model, as would be
distinguishable at least at LISA and DECIGO. The characteristic spectrum is due
to a flat potential, and may be regarded as a hint of supersymmetry. Combined
with the resolution of moduli problem, the expected signal of gravitational

$\mathcal{O}(10^{12-13})\,{\rm GeV}$. Interestingly, our model provides a
natural possibility for explaining the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays
thanks to the fact that the core width of strings in our scenario is very
large, allowing a large enhancement of particle emissions from the cusps of

model realistic devices, it is important to ratify the robustness of the

of conductance, against various disorder and dephasing. This work is hence
devoted to a computational exploration of topological robustness against
various forms of dephasing. For this, we employ phenomenological dephasing
models under the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's function formalism using a
model topological device setup on a 2D-Xene platform. Concurrently, we also
explicitly add disorder via impurity potentials in the channel and averaging
over hundreds of configurations. To describe the extent of robustness, we
quantify the decay of the conductance quantum with increasing disorder under
different conditions. Our analysis shows that these topological phases are
robust to experimentally relevant regimes of momentum dephasing and random
disorder potentials. We note that Rashba mixing worsens the performance of the
QSH phase and point out a mechanism for the same. Further, we observe that the
quantum spin Hall phase break downs due to spin dephasing, but the spin quantum
anomalous Hall phase remains robust. The spin quantum anomalous Hall phase
shows stark robustness under all the dephasing regimes, and shows promise for
realistic device structures for topological electronics applications.

derive cavity and nuclear non-adiabatic coupling elements from the generalized
Hellmann-Feynman theorem, provide a detailed discussion of their properties and
reevaluate the CBO approximation. In the second part, we introduce a crude VSC
Born-Huang expansion based on adiabatic electronic states, which provides a
foundation for widely employed effective Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonians in ground
state vibro-polaritonic chemistry. The latter do not strictly respect the CBO

relative to the CBO ground state due to neglected cavity-induced non-adiabatic
transition dipole couplings to exited states. A perturbative connection between
both ground state approximations is proposed, which identifies the crude CBO
ground state as first-order approximation to its CBO counterpart. We provide an

K by means of muon-spin rotation/relaxation. The linear temperature dependence
of $\lambda^{-2}_{\rm ab}$ for $T\lesssim 0.7$ K suggests the presence of nodes
in the superconducting gap. This statement is further substantiated by
observation of the Volovik effect, $i.e.$ the reduction of $\lambda_{ab}^{-2}$
as a function of the applied magnetic field. The experimental zero-field and
zero-temperature value of $\lambda_{\rm ab}=124(3)$ nm agrees with
$\lambda_{\rm ab}\simeq 130$ nm, calculated based on results of electronic
structure measurements reported in [Phys. Rev X 9, 021048 (2019)]. Our analysis
reveals that a simple nodal superconducting energy gap, described by the lowest
possible harmonic of a gap function, does not capture the dependence of
$\lambda_{\rm ab}^{-2}$ on $T$, so the higher angular harmonics of the energy
gap function need to be introduced.

large-scale instruction-following datasets substantially improves their
performance on a wide range of NLP tasks, especially in the zero-shot setting.
However, even advanced instruction-tuned LLMs still fail to outperform small
LMs on relation extraction (RE), a fundamental information extraction task. We
hypothesize that instruction-tuning has been unable to elicit strong RE
capabilities in LLMs due to RE's low incidence in instruction-tuning datasets,
making up less than 1% of all tasks (Wang et al., 2022). To address this
limitation, we propose QA4RE, a framework that aligns RE with question
answering (QA), a predominant task in instruction-tuning datasets.
Comprehensive zero-shot RE experiments over four datasets with two series of
instruction-tuned LLMs (six LLMs in total) demonstrate that our QA4RE framework
consistently improves LLM performance, strongly verifying our hypothesis and
enabling LLMs to outperform strong zero-shot baselines by a large margin.
Additionally, we provide thorough experiments and discussions to show the
robustness, few-shot effectiveness, and strong transferability of our QA4RE
framework. This work illustrates a promising way of adapting LLMs to
challenging and underrepresented tasks by aligning these tasks with more common
instruction-tuning tasks like QA.

footprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is

measurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets
on Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.
The goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and
optimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first
repository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This
study seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators
measure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects
impact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several
key findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon
emissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on
Hugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the
main application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between
carbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and
ML application domains. These results highlight the need for software
measurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient
model development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,
two classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their
carbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.
The aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and
sustainable model development within the ML community.

brightening (i.e., precursor) for about 300 days, a rapid increase in
brightness for about 60 days, and then a sharp increase of about 1.6 mag in
only a few days to a first peak of $M_r\approx -19.5$ mag. The light curve then
turns over and declines rapidly, until it re-brightens to a second distinct and
sharp peak with $M_r\approx -17.3$ mag centered at about 335 days after the
first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer-series lines with a complex
morphology that includes a narrow component with a width of $\approx 1300$ km
s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx 2500$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we
associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM), and a P Cygni component with an
absorption velocity of $\approx 8500$ km s$^{-1}$ (first peak) and $\approx
5600$ km s$^{-1}$ (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction
shell. Using the bolometric light curve and velocity evolution, we construct an
analytical model to extract the CSM profile and SN properties. We find two
significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of $\approx 10$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and $\approx 5$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ about 0.8 and 2 years

(3-10)\times10^{51}\,{\rm erg}$. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous

concepts relevant to meaning in language (e.g., correctness and semantics),
making program synthesis well-suited as an intermediate testbed for
characterizing the presence (or absence) of meaning in language models.
  We first train a Transformer model on the corpus of programs, then probe the
trained model's hidden states as it completes a program given a specification.
Despite providing no inductive bias toward learning the semantics of the
language, we find that a linear probe is able to extract abstractions of both
current and future program states from the model states. Moreover, there is a
strong, statistically significant correlation between the accuracy of the probe
and the model's ability to generate a program that implements the

states rather than learned by the probe, we design a novel experimental
procedure that intervenes on the semantics of the language while preserving the
lexicon and syntax. We also demonstrate that the model learns to generate
correct programs that are, on average, shorter than those in the training set,

prompting generalist models, often referred to as in-context learning, is to
append a few examples (demonstrations) to the prompt to help the model better
understand the task. While effective, in-context learning can be inefficient
because it makes the input prompt much longer, consuming valuable space in the
context window and leading to larger computational costs. In this paper, we
propose DynaICL, a recipe for efficient prompting with black-box generalist

complexity and the computational budget. To achieve this, we train a meta
controller that predicts the number of in-context examples suitable for the
generalist model to make a good prediction based on the performance-efficiency
trade-off for a specific input. We then dynamically allocate the number of
demonstrations for an input according to predictions from the meta controller
and the given computation budget. Experimental results show that dynamic
example allocation helps achieve a better performance-efficiency trade-off in
two practical settings where computational resources or the required
performance is constrained. Specifically, DynaICL saves up to 46% token budget
compared to the common practice that allocates the same number of in-context
examples to each input. We also find that a meta controller trained on a
certain backbone model and tasks can successfully generalize to unseen models

  with Large Language Model",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Foundation models have made significant strides in various applications,
including text-to-image generation, panoptic segmentation, and natural language
processing. This paper presents Instruct2Act, a framework that utilizes Large
Language Models to map multi-modal instructions to sequential actions for
robotic manipulation tasks. Specifically, Instruct2Act employs the LLM model to
generate Python programs that constitute a comprehensive perception, planning,
and action loop for robotic tasks. In the perception section, pre-defined APIs
are used to access multiple foundation models where the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) accurately locates candidate objects, and CLIP classifies them. In this
way, the framework leverages the expertise of foundation models and robotic
abilities to convert complex high-level instructions into precise policy codes.
Our approach is adjustable and flexible in accommodating various instruction
modalities and input types and catering to specific task demands. We validated
the practicality and efficiency of our approach by assessing it on robotic
tasks in different scenarios within tabletop manipulation domains. Furthermore,
our zero-shot method outperformed many state-of-the-art learning-based policies
in several tasks. The code for our proposed approach is available at
https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Instruct2Act, serving as a robust benchmark for
high-level robotic instruction tasks with assorted modality inputs.

For black holes however, the IR point is the horizon, so one way to interpret
the interior is as an analytic continuation to a ""trans-IR"" imaginary-energy
regime. In this paper, we demonstrate that this analytic continuation preserves
some imprints of the UV physics, particularly near its ""endpoint"" at the
classical singularity. We focus on holographic phase transitions of geometric
objects in round black holes. We first assert the consistency of interpreting
such black holes, including their interiors, as RG flows by constructing a
monotonic $a$-function. We then explore how UV phase transitions of
entanglement entropy and scalar two-point functions, each of which are encoded
by bulk geometry under the holographic mapping, are connected to the structure
of the near-singularity geometry, which is characterized by Kasner exponents.
Using 2d holographic flows triggered by relevant scalar deformations as test
beds, we find that the 3d bulk's near-singularity Kasner exponents can be
viewed as functions of the UV physics precisely when the deformation is
nonzero.

generate soft pruning masks for the weights in a parameter-free manner for a
given pruning target. While differentiable, the simplicity and efficiency of
PDP make it universal enough to deliver state-of-the-art
random/structured/channel pruning results on various vision and natural

next best from the existing techniques shows 81.5% accuracy. In addition, PDP
can be applied to structured pruning, such as N:M pruning and channel pruning.
For 1:4 structured pruning of ResNet18, PDP improved the top-1 ImageNet1k

attention as a part of the performance measures of computers. Quantum
computation is known to offer advantages over classical computation in terms of

has been challenging to analyze due to the lack of a theoretical foundation to
relate the physical notion of energy and the computer-scientific notion of
complexity for quantum computation with finite computational resources. To
bridge this gap, we introduce a general framework for studying energy
consumption of quantum and classical computation based on a computational model
with a black-box oracle, as conventionally used for studying query complexity
in computational complexity theory. With this framework, we derive an upper
bound of energy consumption of quantum computation with covering all costs,
including those of initialization, control, and quantum error correction; in
particular, our analysis shows an energy-consumption bound for a finite-step
Landauer-erasure protocol, progressing beyond the existing asymptotic bound. We
also develop techniques for proving a lower bound of energy consumption of
classical computation based on the energy-conservation law and the
Landauer-erasure bound; significantly, our lower bound can be gapped away from
zero no matter how energy-efficiently we implement the computation and is free
from the computational hardness assumptions. Based on these general bounds, we
rigorously prove that quantum computation achieves an exponential
energy-consumption advantage over classical computation for Simon's problem.
These results provide a fundamental framework and techniques to explore the
physical meaning of quantum advantage in the query-complexity setting based on
energy consumption, opening an alternative way to study the advantages of
quantum computation.

to a phenomenon called eigenvalue repulsion (also known as level repulsion,
avoided crossing or the Wigner-Teller effect), whereby the two families can
interact strongly near extremality. We find that these features are also
present in the QNM spectra of a scalar field in KN, where the perturbation
modes are described by ODEs and thus easier to explore. Starting from the RN
limit, we study how the scalar QNM spectra of KN dramatically changes as we
vary the ratio of charge to angular momentum, all the way until the Kerr limit,
while staying at a fixed distance from extremality. This scalar field case
clarifies the (so far puzzling) relationship between the QNM spectra of RN and

ultimately settle the fate of the QNM spectra in Kerr. We study not just the
slowest-decaying QNMs (both for $\ell=m=0$ and $\ell=m=2$), but several
sub-dominant overtones as well, as these turn out to play a crucial role
understanding the KN QNM spectra. We also give a new high-order WKB expansion

fits that agree reasonably well for volume density but vary for column density,

discrete, but also in the continuous-variable regime. For the example of a
helically twisted photonic-crystal fibre, we experimentally demonstrate that
using appropriate nonorthogonal modes, the polarization-preserving fiber does
not fully scramble these modes over the full Poincar\'e sphere, but that the

low-ionization UV lines ranging from $-$500 to $-$1500 km s$^{-1}$. ERQs with
strong CIV blueshifts are substantially offset in CIV REW and Full-Width at
Half-Maximum (FWHM) from typical blue quasars in the same velocity range. ERQs

quasars have REW = 24 A and FWHM = 6973 km s$^{-1}$. The extreme nature of the
outflows in ERQs might explain some of their other spectral properties, such as
the large CIV REWs and peculiar wingless profiles owing to more extended
broad-line regions participating in outflows. The physical reasons for the
extreme outflow properties of ERQs are unclear; however, larger Eddington
ratios and/or softer ionizing spectra incident on the outflow gas cannot be

Here we discuss a scenario where this is not the case. Recently, it has been
shown that for any number of scalar fields of any mass, the parity-odd
trispectrum of a massless scalar must vanish in the limit of exact scale
invariance due to unitarity and the choice of initial state. By carefully
handling UV-divergences, we show that the one-loop contribution is
non-vanishing and hence leading. Surprisingly, the one-loop parity-odd
trispectrum is simply a rational function of kinematics, which we compute
explicitly in a series of models, including single-clock inflation. Although
the loop contribution is the leading term in the parity-odd sector, its
signal-to-noise ratio is typically bounded from above by that of a
corresponding tree-level parity-even trispectrum, unless instrumental noise and
systematics for the two observables differ. Furthermore, we identify a series
of loop contributions to the wavefunction that cancel exactly when computing
correlators, suggesting a more general phenomenon.

higher-order Fourier analysis, notably through their role in a general form of
the inverse theorem for the Gowers norms. This paper studies these nilspaces
per se, and in connection with further refinements of this inverse theorem that
have been conjectured recently. Our first main result states that every compact
finite-rank nilspace is obtained by taking a free nilspace (a nilspace based on
an abelian group of the form $\mathbb{Z}^{r}\times \mathbb{R}^s$) and
quotienting this by a discrete group action of a specific type, describable in
terms of polynomials. We call these group actions ""higher-order lattice
actions"", as they generalize actions of lattices in $\mathbb{Z}^r\times
\mathbb{R}^s$. The second main result (which relies on the first one)
represents every compact finite-rank nilspace as a double-coset space
$K\backslash G / \Gamma$ where $G$ is a nilpotent Lie group of a specific kind.
These results open the study of these nilspaces to areas more classical than
nilspace theory, such as the theory of topological group actions. The results
also require developing the theory of topological non-compact nilspaces, for
which we provide groundwork in this paper. Applications include new inverse
theorems for Gowers norms on any finite abelian group. These theorems are
purely group theoretic in that the correlating harmonics are based on
double-coset spaces. This yields progress towards the Jamneshan-Tao conjecture.

methods (e.g. nested sampling) fail and even when likelihoods or priors are
intractable or unknown. Bayesian model comparison, i.e. the computation of
Bayes factors or evidence ratios, can be cast as an optimization problem.
Though the Bayesian interpretation of optimal classification is well-known,
here we change perspective and present classes of loss functions that result in
fast, amortized neural estimators that directly estimate convenient functions
of the Bayes factor. This mitigates numerical inaccuracies associated with
estimating individual model probabilities. We introduce the leaky parity-odd
power (l-POP) transform, leading to the novel ``l-POP-Exponential'' loss
function. We explore neural density estimation for data probability in
different models, showing it to be less accurate and scalable than Evidence
Networks. Multiple real-world and synthetic examples illustrate that Evidence
Networks are explicitly independent of dimensionality of the parameter space
and scale mildly with the complexity of the posterior probability density
function. This simple yet powerful approach has broad implications for model
inference tasks. As an application of Evidence Networks to real-world data we
compute the Bayes factor for two models with gravitational lensing data of the
Dark Energy Survey. We briefly discuss applications of our methods to other,
related problems of model comparison and evaluation in implicit inference
settings.

classical experiments from child development is a particularly effective way to
probe the computational abilities of AI models, in general, and LLMs in
particular. First, the methodological techniques of developmental psychology,
such as the use of novel stimuli to control for past experience or control
conditions to determine whether children are using simple associations, can be
equally helpful for assessing the capacities of LLMs. In parallel, testing LLMs
in this way can tell us whether the information that is encoded in text is
sufficient to enable particular responses, or whether those responses depend on
other kinds of information, such as information from exploration of the
physical world. In this work we adapt classical developmental experiments to
evaluate the capabilities of LaMDA, a large language model from Google. We
propose a novel LLM Response Score (LRS) metric which can be used to evaluate
other language models, such as GPT. We find that LaMDA generates appropriate
responses that are similar to those of children in experiments involving social
understanding, perhaps providing evidence that knowledge of these domains is
discovered through language. On the other hand, LaMDA's responses in early
object and action understanding, theory of mind, and especially causal
reasoning tasks are very different from those of young children, perhaps
showing that these domains require more real-world, self-initiated exploration

galaxy's major axis, which contrasts with the more common oblate rotation.
Prolate rotation is thought to be due to major mergers and thus studies of
prolate-rotating systems can help us better understand the hierarchical process
of galaxy evolution. Dynamical studies of such galaxies are important to find
their gravitational potential profile, total mass, and dark matter fraction.
Recently, it has been shown in a cosmological simulation that it is possible to
form a prolate-rotating dwarf galaxy following a dwarf-dwarf merger event. The
simulation also shows that the unusual prolate rotation can be time enduring.
In this particular example, the galaxy continued to rotate around its major
axis for at least $7.4$\,Gyr (from the merger event until the end of the
simulation). In this project, we use mock observations of the hydro-dynamically
simulated prolate-rotating dwarf galaxy to fit various stages of its evolution
with Jeans dynamical models. The Jeans models successfully fit the early oblate
state before the major merger event, and also the late prolate stages of the
simulated galaxy, recovering its mass distribution, velocity dispersion, and
rotation profile. We also ran a prolate-rotating N-body simulation with similar
properties to the cosmologically simulated galaxy, which gradually loses its
angular momentum on a short time scale $\sim100$\,Myr. More tests are needed to
understand why prolate rotation is time enduring in the cosmological

making contributions higher than the optimal value end up harming those who

square lattice with von Neumann neighborhood, while it can have no impact in
others lattices. Furthermore, in parameter regions where a higher-contributing

consider the environment as a fixed constraint, despite the influence of
spatial constraints on agents' performance. Yet hand-designing conducive
environment layouts is inefficient and potentially expensive. The goal of this
paper is to consider the environment as a decision variable in a system-level
optimization problem, where both agent performance and environment cost are
incorporated. Towards this end, we propose novel problems of unprioritized and
prioritized environment optimization, where the former considers agents
unbiasedly and the latter accounts for agent priorities. We show, through
formal proofs, under which conditions the environment can change while
guaranteeing completeness (i.e., all agents reach goals), and analyze the role
of agent priorities in the environment optimization. We proceed to impose
real-world constraints on the environment optimization and formulate it
mathematically as a constrained stochastic optimization problem. Since the
relation between agents, environment and performance is challenging to model,
we leverage reinforcement learning to develop a model-free solution and a
primal-dual mechanism to handle constraints. Distinct information processing
architectures are integrated for various implementation scenarios, including
online/offline optimization and discrete/continuous environment. Numerical
results corroborate the theory and demonstrate the validity and adaptability of

neutrinos has been a longstanding challenge. In a previous work, we report
evidence for a spatial correlation between blazars from the 5th Roma-BZCat
catalog and neutrino data of the highest detectable energies, i.e. >0.1 PeV,
collected by the IceCube Observatory in the southern celestial hemisphere. The
statistical significance is found at the level of 2 x 10^{-6} post-trial. In
this work we test whether a similar correlation exists in the northern
hemisphere, were IceCube is mostly sensitive to <0.1 PeV energies. We find a
consistent correlation between blazars and northern neutrino data at the
pre-trial p-value of 5.12 x 10^{-4}, and a post-trial chance probability of
6.79 x 10^{-3}. Combining the post-trial probabilities observed for the
southern and northern experiments yields a global post-trial chance probability
of 2.59 x 10^{-7} for the genuineness of such correlation. This implies that
the spatial correlation is highly unlikely to arise by chance. Our studies push
forward an all-sky subset of 52 objects as highly likely PeVatron extragalactic
accelerators.

object or scene. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) use multi-focus image
fusion, which combines two or more images to create a more accurate output
image that describes the scene better than any individual input image. WVSN has
various applications, including video surveillance, monitoring, and tracking.
Therefore, a high-level analysis of these networks can benefit Biometrics. This
paper introduces an algorithm that utilizes discrete cosine transform (DCT)
standards to fuse multi-focus images in WVSNs. The spatial frequency (SF) of
the corresponding blocks from the source images determines the fusion
criterion. The blocks with higher spatial frequencies make up the DCT
presentation of the fused image, and the Consistency Verification (CV)
procedure is used to enhance the output image quality. The proposed fusion
method was tested on multiple pairs of multi-focus images coded on JPEG

to the energy cost associated with the exploration between different metastable
states via large scale reorganization of the force chain network. In this
regime, the conventional drag force models break down, and the drag force can
not be decomposed into a depth dependent static pressure and a depth
independent inertial drag as proposed in the existing literature. The high
dynamical stress generates acoustic pulses, which propagate longer distances
rather than decaying exponentially, as observed in the previous works. In the
latter stage of the impact process, the boundary also plays an essential role
in the reorganization of the force chains as the reflected acoustic pulses
interact with the original impact pulses. Furthermore, we study the scaling of
the early stage peak forces with the impact velocity and find that spatial
dimensionality strongly influences the scaling.

we observe a great reduction of the cleavage energy, indicating that vesicle

initial plans from each partner. To complete these tasks, agents need to engage
in situated communication with their partners and coordinate their partial
plans towards a complete plan to achieve a joint task goal. While such
collaboration seems effortless in a human-human team, it is highly challenging
for human-AI collaboration. To address this limitation, this paper takes a step
towards collaborative plan acquisition, where humans and agents strive to learn
and communicate with each other to acquire a complete plan for joint tasks.
Specifically, we formulate a novel problem for agents to predict the missing
task knowledge for themselves and for their partners based on rich perceptual
and dialogue history. We extend a situated dialogue benchmark for symmetric
collaborative tasks in a 3D blocks world and investigate computational
strategies for plan acquisition. Our empirical results suggest that predicting
the partner's missing knowledge is a more viable approach than predicting one's
own. We show that explicit modeling of the partner's dialogue moves and mental

provide insight for future AI agents that can predict what knowledge their
partner is missing and, therefore, can proactively communicate such information
to help their partner acquire such missing knowledge toward a common

  version of submission to the International Symposium on Distributed Computing

conditions of a linearizable FIFO queue to allow concurrent Dequeue instances
to return the same value. It would seem that this should allow faster
implementations, as processes should not need to wait as long to learn about
concurrent operations at remote processes and previous work has shown that
multiplicity queues are computationally less complex than the unrelaxed
version. Intriguingly, recent work has shown that there is, in fact, not much
speedup possible versus an unrelaxed queue implementation. Seeking to
understand this difference between intuition and real behavior, we extend that
work, increasing the lower bound for uniform algorithms. Further, we outline a
path forward toward building proofs for even higher lower bounds, allowing us
to hypothesize that the worst-case time to Dequeue approaches maximum message
delay, which is similar to the time required for an unrelaxed Dequeue. We also
give an upper bound for a special case to show that our bounds are tight at
that point. To achieve our lower bounds, we use extended shifting arguments,
which have been rarely used but allow larger lower bounds than traditional
shifting arguments. We use these in series of inductive indistinguishability
proofs which allow us to extend our proofs beyond the usual limitations of
shifting arguments. This proof structure is an interesting contribution
independently of the main result, as developing new lower bound proof
techniques may have many uses in future work.

significant research efforts; however, there is a lack of mechanisms for PB
which elicit project interactions, such as substitution and complementarity,
from voters. Also, the outcomes of PB in practice are subject to various
minimum/maximum funding constraints on 'types' of projects. There is an
insufficient understanding of how these funding constraints affect PB's
strategic and computational complexities.
  We propose a novel preference elicitation scheme for PB which allows voters
to express how their utilities from projects within 'groups' interact. We
consider preference aggregation done under minimum and maximum funding
constraints on 'types' of projects, where a project can have multiple type
labels as long as this classification can be defined by a 1-laminar structure
(henceforth called 1-laminar funding constraints). Overall, we extend the
Knapsack voting model of Goel et al. in two ways - enriching the preference
elicitation scheme to include project interactions and generalizing the
preference aggregation scheme to include 1-laminar funding constraints.
  We show that the strategyproofness results of Goel et al. for Knapsack voting
continue to hold under 1-laminar funding constraints. Although project
interactions often break the strategyproofness, we study a special case of vote
profiles where truthful voting is a Nash equilibrium under substitution project
interactions. We then turn to the study of the computational complexity of
preference aggregation. Social welfare maximization under project interactions
is NP-hard. As a workaround for practical instances, we give a fixed parameter
tractable (FPT) algorithm for social welfare maximization with respect to the
maximum number of projects in a group.

  Recommendations",,,,,"cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce Multi-Objective Counterfactuals for Design (MCD), a novel method
for counterfactual optimization in design problems. Counterfactuals are
hypothetical situations that can lead to a different decision or choice. In
this paper, the authors frame the counterfactual search problem as a design
recommendation tool that can help identify modifications to a design, leading
to better functional performance. MCD improves upon existing counterfactual
search methods by supporting multi-objective queries, which are crucial in
design problems, and by decoupling the counterfactual search and sampling
processes, thus enhancing efficiency and facilitating objective tradeoff
visualization. The paper demonstrates MCD's core functionality using a
two-dimensional test case, followed by three case studies of bicycle design
that showcase MCD's effectiveness in real-world design problems. In the first
case study, MCD excels at recommending modifications to query designs that can
significantly enhance functional performance, such as weight savings and
improvements to the structural safety factor. The second case study
demonstrates that MCD can work with a pre-trained language model to suggest
design changes based on a subjective text prompt effectively. Lastly, the
authors task MCD with increasing a query design's similarity to a target image
and text prompt while simultaneously reducing weight and improving structural
performance, demonstrating MCD's performance on a complex multimodal query.
Overall, MCD has the potential to provide valuable recommendations for
practitioners and design automation researchers looking for answers to their
``What if'' questions by exploring hypothetical design modifications and their
impact on multiple design objectives. The code, test problems, and datasets

be used directly to compute the predicted value from the feature values.
Furthermore, BELLA maximizes the size of the neighborhood to which the linear

the fastest known greedy-spanner algorithm for pointsets in the plane, devised

Fast-Sparse-Spanner generated near-greedy t-spanners while being fast and

  As a byproduct of our research, we design and engineer Fast-Stretch-Factor, a

typical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the
entire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy
consumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced
delay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy
consumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early
decision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we
start by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification
decisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect
to the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult
to determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To
address this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference
methodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides
guaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping
times. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the
underlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run
time, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).

based on the value of the covariate). A graph of cumulative differences between
the two populations reveals differences in responses as a function of the

graph becomes the average difference over the wide interval of values of the
covariate between the two points; i.e., slope of the graph is the average
difference in responses. (""Average"" refers to the weighted average if the
samples are weighted.) Moreover, a simple statistic known as the Kuiper metric
summarizes into a single scalar the overall differences over all values of the

the resulting r-process abundance distribution, and the structure of nuclei
midshell in both proton and neutron number helps to understand the evolution of

structure of $^{160}$Gd, specifically the $K^\pi$=$4^+$ bands, as well as study
the $\beta$-decay of $^{160}$Eu into $^{160}$Gd.
  \noindent \textbf{Methods:} High-statistics decay spectroscopy of $^{160}$Gd
resulting from the $\beta$-decay of $^{160}$Eu was collected using the GRIFFIN
spectrometer at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility.
  \noindent \textbf{Results:} Two new excited states and ten new transitions
were observed in $^{160}$Gd. The $\beta$-decaying half-lives of the low- and
high-spin isomer in $^{160}$Eu were determined, and the low-spin state's
half-life was measured to be $t_{1/2}=26.0(8)$~s, $\sim$16\% shorter than
previous measurements. Lifetimes of the two $K^\pi$=$4^+$ band-heads in
$^{160}$Gd were measured for the first time, as well as $\gamma$-$\gamma$
angular correlations and mixing ratios of intense transitions out of those
band-heads.
  \noindent \textbf{Conclusions:} Lifetimes and mixing ratios suggest that the
hexadecapole phonon model of the $K^\pi$=$4^+$ band-heads in $^{160}$Gd is
preferred over a simple two-state strong mixing scenario, although further
theoretical calculations are needed to fully understand these states.
Additionally, the 1999.0 keV state in $^{160}$Gd heavily populated in
$\beta$-decay is shown to have positive parity, which raises questions
regarding the structure of the high-spin $\beta$-decaying state in $^{160}$Eu.

significant practical value. The main challenge of the task lies in the
ultra-high redundancy in the long recipe and the large variation reflected in
both food item combination and food item appearance. A de-facto idea to address
this task is to learn a shared feature embedding space in which a food image is
aligned better to its paired recipe than other recipes. However, such
supervised global matching is prone to supervision collapse, i.e., only partial
information that is necessary for distinguishing training pairs can be
identified, while other information that is potentially useful in
generalization could be lost. To mitigate such a problem, we propose a
mask-augmentation-based local matching network (MALM), where an image-text
matching module and a masked self-distillation module benefit each other
mutually to learn generalizable cross-modality representations. On one hand, we
perform local matching between the tokenized representations of image and text
to locate fine-grained cross-modality correspondence explicitly. We involve
representations of masked image patches in this process to alleviate
overfitting resulting from local matching especially when some food items are
underrepresented. On the other hand, predicting the hidden representations of
the masked patches through self-distillation helps to learn general-purpose
image representations that are expected to generalize better. And the
multi-task nature of the model enables the representations of masked patches to
be text-aware and thus facilitates the lost information reconstruction.
Experimental results on Recipe1M dataset show our method can clearly outperform
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our code will be available at

  Environment","This work has been submitted to IEEE for review",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under a changing driving environment, a Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV)
platoon relies strongly on the acquisition of accurate traffic information from
neighboring vehicles as well as reliable commands from a centralized
supervisory controller through the communication network. Even though such
modalities are imperative to ensure the safe and efficient driving performance
of CAVs, they led to multiple security challenges. Thus, a cyberattack on this
network can corrupt vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle
(V2V) communication, which can lead to unsafe or undesired driving scenarios.
Hence, in this paper, we propose a unified V2V and V2I cyberattack detection
scheme along with a V2I isolation scheme for CAVs under changing driving
conditions. The proposed scheme is constructed using a bank of residual
generators with Lyapunov function-based performance guarantees, such as
disturbance-to-state stability, robustness, and sensitivity. Finally, we
showcase the efficacy of our proposed algorithm through two simulation studies,
namely under highway driving and urban driving. The results show that the
proposed scheme can enhance the cybersecurity of CAVs by detecting and
isolating cyberattacks on CAV platoons.

constraints on the dust properties, distribution, and geometry by comparison
with models. However, none of the currently available models fully describe the
observations of AGN currently available. Among the aspects least explored, here
we focus on the role of dust grain size. We offer the community a new spectral
energy distribution (SED) library, hereinafter [GoMar23] model, which is based
on the two-phase torus model developed before with the inclusion of the grain
size as a model parameter, parameterized by the maximum grain size Psize or
equivalently the mass-weighted average grain size < P >. We created 691,200
SEDs using the SKIRT code, where the maximum grain size can vary within the
range Psize = 0.01 - 10.0um ( < P >= 0.007 - 3.41um). We fit this new and
several existing libraries to a sample of 68 nearby and luminous AGNs with
Spitzer/IRS spectra dominated by AGN-heated dust. We find that the [GoMar23]
model can adequately reproduce up to 85-88% of the spectra. The dust grain size
parameter significantly improves the final fit in up to 90% of these spectra.
Statistical tests indicate that the grain size is the third most important
parameter in the fitting procedure (after the size and half opening angle of
the torus). The requirement of a foreground extinction by our model is lower
compared to purely clumpy models. We find that 41% of our sample requires that
the maximum dust grain size is as large as Psize =10um (< P >= 3.41um).
Nonetheless, we also remark that disk+wind and clumpy torus models are still
required to reproduce the spectra of a non-negligible fraction of objects,
suggesting the need for several dust geometries to explain the infrared
continuum of AGN. This work provides tentative evidence for dust grain growth
in the proximity of the AGN.

  In this paper, we propose fast parallel algorithms for Density Peaks
Clustering (DPC), a popular version of density-based clustering. Existing exact
DPC algorithms suffer from low parallelism both in theory and in practice,
which limits their application to large-scale data sets. Our most performant
algorithm, which is based on priority search kd-trees, achieves $O(\log
n\log\log n)$ span (parallel time complexity) for a data set of $n$ points. Our
algorithm is also work-efficient, achieving a work complexity matching the best
existing sequential exact DPC algorithm. In addition, we present another DPC
algorithm based on a Fenwick tree that makes fewer assumptions for its
average-case complexity to hold.
  We provide optimized implementations of our algorithms and evaluate their
performance via extensive experiments. On a 30-core machine with two-way
hyperthreading, we find that our best algorithm achieves a 10.8--13169x speedup

and prone to the effects of disc instability, but during this time the seeds of
planet formation can be sown. It has long been argued that disc fragmentation
can form large gas giant planets at wide orbital separations, but its place in
the planet formation paradigm is hindered by a tendency to form especially
large gas giants or brown dwarfs. We instead suggest that planet formation can
occur early in massive discs, through the gravitational collapse of dust which
can form the seeds of giant planets. This is different from the usual picture
of self-gravitating discs, in which planet formation is considered through the
gravitational collapse of the gas disc into a gas giant precursor. It is
familiar in the sense that the core is formed first, and gas is accreted
thereafter, as is the case in the core accretion scenario. However, by forming
a $\sim 1 M_{\oplus}$ seed from the gravitational collapse of dust within a
self-gravitating disc there exists the potential to overcome traditional growth
barriers and form a planet within a few times $10^5$ years. The accretion of
pebbles is most efficient with centimetre-sized dust, but the accretion of
millimetre sizes can also result in formation within a Myr. Thus, if dust can
grow to these sizes, planetary seeds formed within very young, massive discs
could drastically reduce the timescale of planet formation and potentially
explain the observed ring and gap structures in young discs.

challenges: 1) inability to accurately evaluate the distribution of heatmap; 2)
inability to effectively exploit global spatial structure information. To
address the computational inability challenge, we propose a novel
position-aware and sample-aware central loss. Specifically, our central loss
can absorb position information, enabling accurate evaluation of the heatmap
distribution. More advanced is that our central loss is sample-aware, which can
adaptively distinguish easy and hard samples and make the model more focused on
hard samples while solving the challenge of extreme imbalance between landmarks
and non-landmarks. To address the challenge of ignoring structure information,
a Coordinated Transformer, called CoorTransformer, is proposed, which
establishes long-range dependencies under the guidance of landmark coordination
information, making the attention more focused on the sparse landmarks while
taking advantage of global spatial structure. Furthermore, CoorTransformer can
speed up convergence, effectively avoiding the defect that Transformers have
difficulty converging in sparse representation learning. Using the advanced
CoorTransformer and central loss, we propose a generalized detection model that
can handle various scenarios, inherently exploiting the underlying relationship
between landmarks and incorporating rich structural knowledge around the target
landmarks. We analyzed and evaluated CoorTransformer and central loss on three
challenging landmark detection tasks. The experimental results show that our

  against natural perturbations and data poisoning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In overhead image segmentation tasks, including additional spectral bands
beyond the traditional RGB channels can improve model performance. However, it
is still unclear how incorporating this additional data impacts model
robustness to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations. For adversarial
robustness, the additional information could improve the model's ability to
distinguish malicious inputs, or simply provide new attack avenues and
vulnerabilities. For natural perturbations, the additional information could
better inform model decisions and weaken perturbation effects or have no
significant influence at all. In this work, we seek to characterize the
performance and robustness of a multispectral (RGB and near infrared) image
segmentation model subjected to adversarial attacks and natural perturbations.
While existing adversarial and natural robustness research has focused
primarily on digital perturbations, we prioritize on creating realistic
perturbations designed with physical world conditions in mind. For adversarial
robustness, we focus on data poisoning attacks whereas for natural robustness,
we focus on extending ImageNet-C common corruptions for fog and snow that
coherently and self-consistently perturbs the input data. Overall, we find both
RGB and multispectral models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks
regardless of input or fusion architectures and that while physically
realizable natural perturbations still degrade model performance, the impact
differs based on fusion architecture and input data.

legal sharing of clinical data requires the removal of protected health

de-identification, is often achieved through the use of machine learning
algorithms by many commercial and open-source systems. While these systems have
shown compelling results on average, the variation in their performance across
different demographic groups has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we
investigate the bias of de-identification systems on names in clinical notes
via a large-scale empirical analysis. To achieve this, we create 16 name sets
that vary along four demographic dimensions: gender, race, name popularity, and
the decade of popularity. We insert these names into 100 manually curated
clinical templates and evaluate the performance of nine public and private
de-identification methods. Our findings reveal that there are statistically
significant performance gaps along a majority of the demographic dimensions in
most methods. We further illustrate that de-identification quality is affected
by polysemy in names, gender context, and clinical note characteristics. To
mitigate the identified gaps, we propose a simple and method-agnostic solution
by fine-tuning de-identification methods with clinical context and diverse
names. Overall, it is imperative to address the bias in existing methods
immediately so that downstream stakeholders can build high-quality systems to

access news has enabled the wide dissemination of fake news. This has motivated
numerous studies on automating fake news detection. Although there have been
limited attempts at unsupervised fake news detection, their performance suffers
due to not exploiting the knowledge from various modalities related to news
records and due to the presence of various latent biases in the existing news
datasets. To address these limitations, this work proposes an effective
framework for unsupervised fake news detection, which first embeds the
knowledge available in four modalities in news records and then proposes a
novel noise-robust self-supervised learning technique to identify the veracity
of news records from the multi-modal embeddings. Also, we propose a novel
technique to construct news datasets minimizing the latent biases in existing
news datasets. Following the proposed approach for dataset construction, we
produce a Large-scale Unlabelled News Dataset consisting 419,351 news articles
related to COVID-19, acronymed as LUND-COVID. We trained the proposed
unsupervised framework using LUND-COVID to exploit the potential of large
datasets, and evaluate it using a set of existing labelled datasets. Our
results show that the proposed unsupervised framework largely outperforms
existing unsupervised baselines for different tasks such as multi-modal fake
news detection, fake news early detection and few-shot fake news detection,
while yielding notable improvements for unseen domains during training.

employers before matches are formed through a clearinghouse One prominent
example is the market for medical residencies and fellowships, which in recent
years has had a large increase in the number of interviews. There have been
numerous efforts to reduce the cost of interviewing in these markets using a
variety of signalling mechanisms, however, the theoretical properties of these
mechanisms have not been systematically studied in models with rich
preferences. In this paper we give theoretical guarantees for a variety of
mechanisms, finding that these mechanisms must properly balance competition.
  We consider a random market in which agents' latent preferences are based on
observed qualities, personal taste and (ex post) interview shocks and assume
that following an interview mechanism a final stable match is generated with
respect to preferences over interview partners. We study a novel many-to-many
interview match mechanism to coordinate interviews and that with relatively few
interviews, when suitably designed, the interview match yields desirable
properties.
  We find that under the interview matching mechanism with a limit of $k$
interviews per candidate and per position, the fraction of positions that are
unfilled vanishes quickly with $k$. Moreover the ex post efficiency grows
rapidly with $k$, and reporting sincere pre-interview preferences to this
mechanism is an $\epsilon$-Bayes Nash equilibrium. Finally, we compare the
performance of the interview match to other signalling and coordination
mechanisms from the literature.

solvers over state-of-the-art close to an order of magnitude for early
implementations. The asymptotic scaling is $O(\kappa \log(\kappa/\epsilon))$,
slightly looser than the $O(\kappa \log(1/\epsilon))$ scaling of the
asymptotically optimal algorithm of Costa et al. However, our algorithm
outperforms the latter for all condition numbers up to $\kappa \approx
10^{32}$, at which point $Q$ is comparably large, and both algorithms are

problem-agnostic and architecture-agnostic, and hence can be deployed in any

driving certain Hamiltonians hosting quantum many-body scars, akin to recent
experimental observations in driven Rydberg atom arrays. Our construction takes
advantage of an su(2) spectrum generating algebra associated with the static
quantum-scarred Hamiltonian, which enacts a $\pi$-rotation within the scar
subspace after one period of time evolution with appropriately chosen driving
parameters. This yields period-doubled (subharmonic) responses in local
observables for any choice of initial state residing in the scar subspace. The
quasienergy spectrum features atypical $\pi$-paired eigenstates embedded in an
otherwise fully thermal spectrum.The protocol requires neither a large driving
frequency nor a large driving amplitude, and is thus distinct from the
prethermalization physics in previous investigations of the driven PXP model.
We demonstrate our scheme using several spin-1/2 and spin-1 quantum scarred
models possessing an exact su(2) spectrum generating algebra, as well as a
symmetry-deformed PXP model, where the su(2) algebra is only approximate. Our
results extend the class of models hosting quantum many-body scars that can be
leveraged to yield time-crystalline behaviors under periodic driving.

application of the method to proton-proton colliders brings new challenges due

Furthermore, since the non-perturbative distribution functions takes an
important role to describe the experimental distributions, the presence of them
makes the information of the partons diluted. At Leading Order (LO) in
perturbative calculations, the momentum fractions involved in hard scattering
processes are known exactly in terms of kinematical variables of initial and

confirmed that the interaction between MO and ME effects occurs depending on

this feature in lake systems remains unclear. Moreover, the power law itself
was found inadequate for fully describing the size distribution of lakes, due
to deviations at the two ends of size range. Based on observed and simulated
lakes in 11 hydro-climatic zones of China, we established a conceptual model
for lake systems, which covers the whole size range of lake size distribution
and reveals the underlying driving mechanism. The full lake size distribution
is composed of three components, with three phases featured by exponential,
stretched-exponential and power law distribution. The three phases represent
system states with successively increasing degrees of heterogeneity and
orderliness, and more importantly, indicate the dominance of exogenic and
endogenic forces, respectively. As the dominant driving force changes from
endogenic to exogenic, a phase transition occurs with lake size distribution
shifted from power law to stretched-exponential and further to exponential
distribution. Apart from compressing the power law phase, exogenic force also
increases its scaling exponent, driving the corresponding lake size power
spectrum into the regime of blue noise. During this process, the
autocorrelation function of the lake system diverges with a possibility of
going to infinity, indicating the loss of system resilience.

unclear. Considering low-luminosity bursts with smaller redshift generally, we
choose three Swift long burst samples and classify them into low- and
high-luminosity bursts in order to check whether the low-redshift excess is
existent and if the excess is biased by the sample size and completeness. To
degenerate the redshift evolution from luminosity, we adopt the non-parametric
method to study the event rate of the two types of long bursts in each sample.
It is found that the high-luminosity burst rates are consistent with the star
formation rate within the whole redshift range while the event rates of
low-luminosity bursts exceed the star formation rate at low redshift of z < 1.
Consequently, we conclude that the low-redshift excess is contributed by the

in the training data is under-explored, with multiple key challenges to be
addressed including (1) the extreme space complexity when training on all
input-output mode combinations, (2) difference of graph topologies between the
input and the output modes, and (3) how to generalize the model to (unseen)
target domains that are not in the training data. To fill the gap, we propose a
multi-input, multi-output, hypernetwork-based graph neural network
(MultiHyperGNN) that employs a encoder and a decoder to encode topologies of
both input and output modes and semi-supervised link prediction to enhance the
graph transformation task. Instead of training on all mode combinations,
MultiHyperGNN preserves a constant space complexity with the encoder and the
decoder produced by two novel hypernetworks. Comprehensive experiments show
that MultiHyperGNN has a superior performance than competing models in both
prediction and domain generalization tasks.

adoption in many industrial applications, this survey concerns their safety and
trustworthiness. First, we review known vulnerabilities of the LLMs,
categorising them into inherent issues, intended attacks, and unintended bugs.
Then, we consider if and how the Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques,
which have been widely developed for traditional software and deep learning
models such as convolutional neural networks, can be integrated and further
extended throughout the lifecycle of the LLMs to provide rigorous analysis to
the safety and trustworthiness of LLMs and their applications. Specifically, we
consider four complementary techniques: falsification and evaluation,
verification, runtime monitoring, and ethical use. Considering the fast
development of LLMs, this survey does not intend to be complete (although it
includes 300 references), especially when it comes to the applications of LLMs
in various domains, but rather a collection of organised literature reviews and
discussions to support the quick understanding of the safety and

are challenging to be directly adapted to model document. They are unable to
handle the layout representation in documents, e.g. word, line and paragraph,

between efficiency and performance. To tackle the concerns, we propose
Fast-StrucTexT, an efficient multi-modal framework based on the StrucTexT
algorithm with an hourglass transformer architecture, for visual document
understanding. Specifically, we design a modality-guided dynamic token merging
block to make the model learn multi-granularity representation and prunes
redundant tokens. Additionally, we present a multi-modal interaction module
called Symmetry Cross Attention (SCA) to consider multi-modal fusion and
efficiently guide the token mergence. The SCA allows one modality input as
query to calculate cross attention with another modality in a dual phase.
Extensive experiments on FUNSD, SROIE, and CORD datasets demonstrate that our

performing, the interactions they engage in, as well as subject-specific

auxiliary-memory-powered deep neural network framework for the improved
modelling of historical knowledge. Specifically, we disentangle
subject-specific, task-specific, and other auxiliary information from the
observed pose sequences and utilise these factorised features to query the
memory. A novel Multi-Head knowledge retrieval scheme leverages these
factorised feature embeddings to perform multiple querying operations over the
historical observations captured within the auxiliary memory. Moreover, our
proposed dynamic masking strategy makes this feature disentanglement process
dynamic. Two novel loss functions are introduced to encourage diversity within
the auxiliary memory while ensuring the stability of the memory contents, such
that it can locate and store salient information that can aid the long-term
prediction of future motion, irrespective of data imbalances or the diversity
of the input data distribution. With extensive experiments conducted on two

for a combination of two fields, named as Quintom models. We consider two types
of models, one as the sum of the quintessence and phantom potentials and other
including an interacting term between fields. We find that adding one degree of
freedom, by an interacting term, the dynamics enriches considerably and could
lead to an improvement in the fit of $-2\ln\Delta \Like_{\rm max}= 5.13$,
compared to $\Lambda$CDM. The resultant effective equation of state is now able
to cross the phantom divide line, and in several cases present an oscillatory

equilibrium-based solution concept for fair division of discrete items to
agents with combinatorial demands. In theory, it is known that in
asymptotically large markets:
  1. For incentives, the A-CEEI mechanism is Envy-Free-but-for-Tie-Breaking
(EF-TB), which implies that it is Strategyproof-in-the-Large (SP-L).
  2. From a computational perspective, computing the equilibrium solution is
unfortunately a computationally intractable problem (in the worst-case,
assuming $\textsf{PPAD}\ne \textsf{FP}$).
  We develop a new heuristic algorithm that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art by multiple orders of magnitude. This new, faster algorithm
lets us perform experiments on real-world inputs for the first time. We
discover that with real-world preferences, even in a realistic implementation
that satisfies the EF-TB and SP-L properties, agents may have surprisingly
simple and plausible deviations from truthful reporting of preferences. To this
end, we propose a novel strengthening of EF-TB, which dramatically reduces the
potential for strategic deviations from truthful reporting in our experiments.
  A (variant of) our algorithm is now in production: on real course allocation
problems it is much faster, has zero clearing error, and has stronger incentive
properties than the prior state-of-the-art implementation.

module by mining their relationship to the target event and compresses their
information into longitudinal visit embeddings through a visit attention
learning network. LATTE employs a recurrent neural network to capture the
sequential dependency between the target event and visit embeddings
before/after it. To improve label efficiency, LATTE constructs highly
informative longitudinal silver-standard labels from large-scale unlabeled

sclerosis. We use various evaluation metrics present in the literature
including the $ABC_{gain}$, the proportion of reduction in the area between the
observed event indicator and the predicted cumulative incidences in reference

substantial improvement over benchmark methods such as SAMGEP and RETAIN in all

a novel topology combining both a fast consensus rate and small maximum degree
called the Base-$(k + 1)$ Graph. Unlike the existing topologies, the Base-$(k +

on human-annotated rationales such as Chain-of-Thought prompting fall short.
Our work makes one of the first attempts at highlighting the potential of post
hoc explanations as valuable tools for enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs.
Furthermore, we conduct additional empirical analyses and ablation studies to
demonstrate the impact of each of the components of AMPLIFY, which, in turn,
leads to critical insights for refining in-context learning.

in multimodal data fusion and learning, where multiple sensors, including
depth, infrared, and visual, are used to capture the environment across diverse
spectral ranges. Despite these advancements, there has been no systematic and
comprehensive evaluation of fusing RGB-D and thermal modalities to date. While
autonomous driving using LiDAR, radar, RGB, and other sensors has garnered
substantial research interest, along with the fusion of RGB and depth
modalities, the integration of thermal cameras and, specifically, the fusion of
RGB-D and thermal data, has received comparatively less attention. This might
be partly due to the limited number of publicly available datasets for such
applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of both,
state-of-the-art and traditional methods used in fusing RGB-D and thermal
camera data for various applications, such as site inspection, human tracking,
fault detection, and others. The reviewed literature has been categorised into
technical areas, such as 3D reconstruction, segmentation, object detection,
available datasets, and other related topics. Following a brief introduction
and an overview of the methodology, the study delves into calibration and
registration techniques, then examines thermal visualisation and 3D
reconstruction, before discussing the application of classic feature-based
techniques as well as modern deep learning approaches. The paper concludes with
a discourse on current limitations and potential future research directions. It
is hoped that this survey will serve as a valuable reference for researchers
looking to familiarise themselves with the latest advancements and contribute
to the RGB-DT research field.

been studied within two primary models: (1) Where a partial network is fixed a
priori, and thus corruptions can occur dependent on its structure, and (2)
Where edges in the communication graph are determined dynamically as part of
the protocol. Whereas a rich literature has succeeded in mapping out the
feasibility and limitations of graph structures supporting secure computation
in the fixed-graph model (including strong classical lower bounds), these
bounds do not apply in the latter dynamic-graph setting, which has recently
seen exciting new results, but remains relatively unexplored.
  In this work, we initiate a similar foundational study of MPC within the
dynamic-graph model. As a first step, we investigate the property of graph
expansion. All existing protocols (implicitly or explicitly) yield
communication graphs which are expanders, but it is not clear whether this is
inherent. Our results consist of two types (for constant fraction of
corruptions):
  * Upper bounds: We demonstrate secure protocols whose induced communication
graphs are not expander graphs, within a wide range of settings (computational,
information theoretic, with low locality, even with low locality and adaptive
security), each assuming some form of input-independent setup.
  * Lower bounds: In the plain model (no setup) with adaptive corruptions, we
demonstrate that for certain functionalities, no protocol can maintain a
non-expanding communication graph against all adversarial strategies. Our lower
bound relies only on protocol correctness (not privacy), and requires a
surprisingly delicate argument.
  More generally, we provide a formal framework for analyzing the evolving
communication graph of MPC protocols, giving a starting point for studying the
relation between secure computation and further, more general graph properties.

different states characterized by different spectral and timing properties,
understood in the framework of a hot corona coexisting with a thin accretion
disk whose inner edge is truncated. There are several open questions related to
the nature and properties of the corona, the thin disk, and dynamics behind the
hard state. This motivated us to perform two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations of accretion flows onto a 10 solar masses black hole. We consider a
two-temperature plasma, incorporate radiative cooling with bremmstrahlung,
synchrotron and comptonization losses and approximate the Schwarzschild
spacetime via a pseudo-Newtonian potential. We varied the mass accretion rate
in the range 0.02 <= Mdot/Mdot_Edd <= 0.35. Our simulations show the natural
emergence of a colder truncated thin disk embedded in a hot corona, as required
to explain the hard state of XRBs. We found that as Mdot increases, the corona
contracts and the inner edge of the thin disk gets closer to the event horizon.
At a critical accretion rate 0.02 <= Mdot_crit\Mdot_Edd <= 0.06, the thin disk
disappears entirely. We discuss how our simulations compare with XRB
observations in the hard state.

$512^3$ particles in a box size of $500 h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$. We evaluate the
resulting UNet model not only using the training-like test samples, but also
using the typical N-body simulations, including the Jiutian simulation which
has $6144^3$ particles in a box size of $1000 h^{-1}{\rm {Mpc}}$, and the
ELUCID simulation which has a different cosmology. The real-space dark matter
density fields in the three simulations can all be recovered consistently with
only a small reduction of the cross-correlation power spectrum at 1\% and 10\%
levels at $k=0.1$ and $0.3~h\mathrm{Mpc^{-1}}$, respectively. It is evident
that the reconstruction helps to correct for the redshift-space distortions and
is unaffected by the different cosmologies between the training sample ({\bf
Planck2018}) and the test sample ({\bf WMAP5}). In addition, we tested the
application of the UNet-reconstructed density field to recover the velocity \&

Investigating OSS-Fuzz Bug History",,,"10.1109/MSR59073.2023.00038",,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  BACKGROUND: Software engineers must be vigilant in preventing and correcting
vulnerabilities and other critical bugs. In servicing this need, numerous tools
and techniques have been developed to assist developers. Fuzzers, by
autonomously generating inputs to test programs, promise to save time by
detecting memory corruption, input handling, exception cases, and other issues.
  AIMS: The goal of this work is to empower developers to prioritize their
quality assurance by analyzing the history of bugs generated by OSS-Fuzz.
Specifically, we examined what has happened when a project adopts fuzzing as a
quality assurance practice by measuring bug lifespans, learning opportunities,
and bug types.
  METHOD: We analyzed 44,102 reported issues made public by OSS-Fuzz prior to
March 12, 2022. We traced the Git commit ranges reported by repeated fuzz
testing to the source code repositories to identify how long fuzzing bugs
remained in the system, who fixes these bugs, and what types of problems
fuzzers historically have found. We identified the bug-contributing commits to
estimate when the bug containing code was introduced, and measure the timeline
from introduction to detection to fix.
  RESULTS: We found that bugs detected in OSS-Fuzz have a median lifespan of
324 days, but that bugs, once detected, only remain unaddressed for a median of
2 days. Further, we found that of the 8,099 issues for which a source
committing author can be identified, less than half (45.9%) of issues were
fixed by the same author that introduced the bug.
  CONCLUSIONS: The results show that fuzzing can be used to makes a positive
impact on a project that takes advantage in terms of their ability to address
bugs in a time frame conducive to fixing mistakes prior to a product release.

deficiency in capturing the overall feature properties of local client data
that exhibit disparate distributions. In response, generative adversarial
networks (GANs) have recently been exploited in FL to address data
heterogeneity since GANs can be integrated for data regeneration without
exposing original raw data. Despite some successes, existing GAN-related FL
frameworks often incur heavy communication cost and also elicit other privacy
concerns, which limit their applications in real scenarios. To this end, this
work proposes a novel FL framework that requires only partial GAN model
sharing. Named as PS-FedGAN, this new framework enhances the GAN releasing and
training mechanism to address heterogeneous data distributions across clients
and to strengthen privacy preservation at reduced communication cost,
especially over wireless networks. Our analysis demonstrates the convergence
and privacy benefits of the proposed PS-FEdGAN framework. Through experimental
results based on several well-known benchmark datasets, our proposed PS-FedGAN
shows great promise to tackle FL under non-IID client data distributions, while

and the joint chance constraints are adopted to handle the uncertainty. Then,
the control parameters of inverter-based resources, the base point power, and
the regulation reserve of all dispatchable resources in the ITD system are
jointly optimized for the minimum operating cost. TPS and ADNs can deliver base
point power bidirectionally and provide frequency regulation support
bidirectionally, which extend the existing reserve assumption in ITD dispatch
and enhance the operational security of the ITD system. Moreover, based on the
alternating direction of multiplier algorithm, a two-layer distributed

show that the CFC-SED model can fully utilize the potential of multiple

both proposed un-standardized and standardized test statistics. The proposed
procedure is illustrated using the induced smoothed rank-based estimator but is
directly applicable to other popular estimators such as non-smooth rank-based
estimator or least-squares estimator.Our proposed methods are rigorously
evaluated using extensive simulation experiments that demonstrate their
effectiveness in maintaining a Type I error rate and detecting departures from
the assumed AFT model in practical sample sizes and censoring rates.
Furthermore, the proposed approach is applied to the analysis of the Primary

images that only include eyes or restricted ranges of faces with low resolution
(less than $128\times128$) to largely reduce interference from other attributes
such as hairs, which limits application scenarios. To cope with this
limitation, we proposed a portable network, called ReDirTrans, achieving
latent-to-latent translation for redirecting gaze directions and head
orientations in an interpretable manner. ReDirTrans projects input latent
vectors into aimed-attribute embeddings only and redirects these embeddings
with assigned pitch and yaw values. Then both the initial and edited embeddings
are projected back (deprojected) to the initial latent space as residuals to
modify the input latent vectors by subtraction and addition, representing old
status removal and new status addition. The projection of aimed attributes only
and subtraction-addition operations for status replacement essentially mitigate
impacts on other attributes and the distribution of latent vectors. Thus, by
combining ReDirTrans with a pretrained fixed e4e-StyleGAN pair, we created
ReDirTrans-GAN, which enables accurately redirecting gaze in full-face images

SAT is heavily constrained, and the conventional evolutionary operators are

to achieve this objective requires resolving a nontrivial credit assignment
problem with robotic agents having continuous action spaces. Hence, we
developed a new algorithm called Navigation with Counterfactual Fairness Filter
(NCF2). With NCF2, each agent performs counterfactual inference on whether it
can advance toward its goal or should stay still to let other agents go. Doing
so allows us to effectively address the aforementioned credit assignment
problem and improve fairness regarding travel delays while maintaining high
efficiency and safety. Our extensive experimental results in several
challenging multi-robot navigation environments demonstrate the greater
effectiveness of NCF2 as compared to state-of-the-art fairness-aware
multi-agent reinforcement learning methods. Our demo videos and code are

classical alloys. After the deposition processes, scanning electron microscopy,

employed to find the morphology, thickness, and chemical and phase compositions
of the coatings. Nanohardness and its related parameters, namely H3.Er2, H.E,

estimate the stability range for the selected coatings. The results indicated
the formation of as-deposited coatings exhibiting an amorphous structure as a

with frames stored in a reference map for localization. Existing methods
include sequence matching and sequence descriptor-based retrieval. The former
is based on the assumption of constant velocity, which is difficult to hold in
real scenarios and does not get rid of the intrinsic single frame descriptor

whole sequence, but current sequence descriptors are only constructed by
feature aggregation of multi-frames, with no temporal information interaction.
In this paper, we propose a sequential descriptor extraction method to fuse
spatiotemporal information effectively and generate discriminative descriptors.
Specifically, similar features on the same frame focu on each other and learn
space structure, and the same local regions of different frames learn local
feature changes over time. And we use sliding windows to control the temporal
self-attention range and adpot relative position encoding to construct the
positional relationships between different features, which allows our
descriptor to capture the inherent dynamics in the frame sequence and local

  Recognition through Redefined Skeletal Topology Awareness",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have long defined the state-of-the-art in
skeleton-based action recognition, leveraging their ability to unravel the
complex dynamics of human joint topology through the graph's adjacency matrix.
However, an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they
tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This
process, while seemingly efficient, causes a gradual decay of bone connectivity
data, culminating in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to map.
As a remedy, we propose a threefold strategy: (1) We forge an innovative
pathway that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph
distances. This approach preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in
conventional GCNs. (2) We highlight an oft-overlooked feature - the temporal
mean of a skeletal sequence, which, despite its modest guise, carries highly
action-specific information. (3) Our investigation revealed strong variations
in joint-to-joint relationships across different actions. This finding exposes
the limitations of a single adjacency matrix in capturing the variations of
relational configurations emblematic of human movement, which we remedy by
proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC.
This evolution slashes parameters by a substantial margin (above 40%), while
elevating performance beyond original GCNs. Our full model, the BlockGCN,
establishes new standards in skeleton-based action recognition for small model
sizes. Its high accuracy, notably on the large-scale NTU RGB+D 120 dataset,
stand as compelling proof of the efficacy of BlockGCN. The source code and

the current enthusiasm for GAMs, their susceptibility to concurvity - i.e.,
(possibly non-linear) dependencies between the features - has hitherto been
largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate how concurvity can severly impair the
interpretability of GAMs and propose a remedy: a conceptually simple, yet
effective regularizer which penalizes pairwise correlations of the non-linearly

differentiable additive model, such as Neural Additive Models or NeuralProphet,
and enhances interpretability by eliminating ambiguities due to self-canceling
feature contributions. We validate the effectiveness of our regularizer in
experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets for time-series and
tabular data. Our experiments show that concurvity in GAMs can be reduced
without significantly compromising prediction quality, improving
interpretability and reducing variance in the feature importances.

(FRBs), associated with turbulent media which cause radiowave scattering.
Similarly to dispersion, scattering is an important probe of the media along
the line of sight to an FRB source, such as the circum-burst or circum-galactic
mediums (CGM). Measurements of characteristic scattering times alone are
insufficient to constrain the position of the dominant scattering media along
the line of sight. However, where more than one scattering screen exists,
Galactic scintillation can be leveraged to form strong constraints. We quantify
the scattering and scintillation in 10 FRBs with 1) known host galaxies and
redshifts and 2) captured voltage data enabling high time resolution analysis,
obtained from the Commensal Real-time ASKAP (Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder) Fast Transient survey science project (CRAFT). We find strong
evidence for two screens in three cases. For FRBs 20190608B and 20210320C, we
find evidence for scattering screens less than approximately 16.7 and 3000 kpc
respectively, from their sources. For FRB 20201124A we find evidence for a
scattering screen at $\approx$26 kpc. Each of these measures is consistent with
the scattering occurring in the host ISM (inter-stellar medium) or CGM. If
pulse broadening is assumed to be contributed by the host galaxy ISM or
circum-burst environment, the definitive lack of observed scintillation in four
FRBs in our sample suggests that existing models may be over-estimating
scattering times associated with the Milky Way's ISM, similar to the
anomalously low scattering observed for FRB 20201124A.

the next one in an auto-regressive manner. Our scalable approach allows for

from sequentially arrived data. Previous works adopt the conventional
classification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a
classifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks
or classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding
to one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters
of a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains
all historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually
required to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named
AttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks.
Specifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model
CLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from
both images and text. Text consists of a category name and a fixed number of
learnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute word bank
and serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for
classification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts,
which encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively
mitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We
evaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous
state-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with
domain-shift and long-sequence learning. The results show that our method
performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation code

this work, we investigate the polarization of optically-pumped alkali-metal
atoms in a millimeter-sized cell heated to $% 150 $ Celsius. We consider two
extreme boundary conditions: fully depolarizing and nondepolarizing boundaries,
and we provide an analytical estimation of the polarization difference between

power to prevent illumination of the cell wall and increase the pump intensity

laser frequency can not be detuned since it is locked to the absorption peaks.

insufficient for direct diagnosis due to the absence of diagnostic strategies.
The conventional approach to address this challenge involves expensive
fine-tuning of LLMs. Alternatively, a more appealing solution is the
development of a plugin that empowers LLMs to perform medical conversation
tasks. Drawing inspiration from in-context learning, we propose PlugMed, a
Plug-and-Play Medical Dialogue System that facilitates appropriate dialogue
actions by LLMs through two modules: the prompt generation (PG) module and the
response ranking (RR) module. The PG module is designed to capture dialogue
information from both global and local perspectives. It selects suitable
prompts by assessing their similarity to the entire dialogue history and recent
utterances grouped by patient symptoms, respectively. Additionally, the RR
module incorporates fine-tuned SLMs as response filters and selects appropriate
responses generated by LLMs. Moreover, we devise a novel evaluation method
based on intent and medical entities matching to assess the efficacy of
dialogue strategies in medical conversations more effectively. Experimental
evaluations conducted on three unlabeled medical dialogue datasets, including
both automatic and manual assessments, demonstrate that our model surpasses the

Optimization, and is critical to the success of deep learning models. Despite
its astonishing performance, little non-heuristic theory has been developed to
describe the underlying working mechanism. This paper gives a theoretical
accounting of Random Search. We introduce the concept of \emph{scattering
dimension} that describes the landscape of the underlying function, and
quantifies the performance of random search. We show that, when the environment
is noise-free, the output of random search converges to the optimal value in
probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left( \frac{1}{T}

by transferring inventory pods to designated workstations while navigating
narrow aisles formed by tightly packed pods. This problem is typically modeled
as a Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) problem, which is then solved by
repeatedly planning collision-free paths for agents on a fixed graph, as in the
Rolling-Horizon Collision Resolution (RHCR) algorithm. However, existing
approaches make the limiting assumption that agents are only allowed to move
pods that correspond to their current task, while considering the other pods as
stationary obstacles (even though all pods are movable). This behavior can
result in unnecessarily long paths which could otherwise be avoided by opening
additional corridors via pod manipulation. To this end, we explore the
implications of allowing agents the flexibility of dynamically relocating pods.
We call this new problem Terraforming MAPD (tMAPD) and develop an RHCR-based
approach to tackle it. As the extra flexibility of terraforming comes at a
significant computational cost, we utilize this capability judiciously by
identifying situations where it could make a significant impact on the solution
quality. In particular, we invoke terraforming in response to disruptions that
often occur in automated warehouses, e.g., when an item is dropped from a pod
or when agents malfunction. Empirically, using our approach for tMAPD, where
disruptions are modeled via a stochastic process, we improve throughput by over
10%, reduce the maximum service time (the difference between the drop-off time
and the pickup time of a pod) by more than 50%, without drastically increasing
the runtime, compared to the MAPD setting.

encoder architecture with partially noising processes for conditional text
generation, but its degree of flexibility for conditional modeling is limited.
In fact, the encoder-decoder architecture is naturally more flexible for its
detachable encoder and decoder modules, which is extensible to multilingual and
multimodal generation tasks for conditions and target texts. However, the
encoding process of conditional texts lacks the understanding of target texts.
To this end, a spiral interaction architecture for encoder-decoder text
diffusion (DiffuSIA) is proposed. Concretely, the conditional information from
encoder is designed to be captured by the diffusion decoder, while the target
information from decoder is designed to be captured by the conditional encoder.
These two types of information flow run through multilayer interaction spirally
for deep fusion and understanding. DiffuSIA is evaluated on four text
generation tasks, including paraphrase, text simplification, question

DiffuSIA achieves competitive performance among previous methods on all four
tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of the
proposed method.

overall layout, color, structure, object shape, and so on. To adapt diffusion
models for controllable image synthesis, several methods have been proposed to
incorporate the required conditions as regularization upon the intermediate
features of the diffusion denoising network. These methods, known as
early-constraint ones in this paper, have difficulties in handling multiple
conditions with a single solution. They intend to train separate models for
each specific condition, which require much training cost and result in
non-generalizable solutions. To address these difficulties, we propose a new
approach namely late-constraint: we leave the diffusion networks unchanged, but
constrain its output to be aligned with the required conditions. Specifically,
we train a lightweight condition adapter to establish the correlation between
external conditions and internal representations of diffusion models. During
the iterative denoising process, the conditional guidance is sent into
corresponding condition adapter to manipulate the sampling process with the
established correlation. We further equip the introduced late-constraint

governance; and a normative approach, aimed at developing and applying
standards for appropriate global AI governance. The two approaches offer
questions, concepts, and theories that are helpful in gaining an understanding

data analysis in particle physics, but computationally very expensive. One
subdetector, the calorimeter, dominates the computational time due to the high
granularity of its cells and complexity of the interaction. Generative models
can provide more rapid sample production, but currently require significant
effort to optimize performance for specific detector geometries, often
requiring many networks to describe the varying cell sizes and arrangements,
which do not generalize to other geometries. We develop a {\it geometry-aware}
autoregressive model, which learns how the calorimeter response varies with
geometry, and is capable of generating simulated responses to unseen geometries
without additional training. The geometry-aware model outperforms a baseline,
unaware model by 50\% in metrics such as the Wasserstein distance between
generated and true distributions of key quantities which summarize the
simulated response. A single geometry-aware model could replace the hundreds of
generative models currently designed for calorimeter simulation by physicists
analyzing data collected at the Large Hadron Collider. For the study of future
detectors, such a foundational model will be a crucial tool, dramatically
reducing the large upfront investment usually needed to develop generative
calorimeter models.

Additionally, this intuition-based selection of the tweets might lead to a high

intermetallic compound YbNiSn, formerly categorized as a ferromagnetic Kondo
compound. At zero field, an increase in scattering intensity was observed on
top of allowed and forbidden nuclear reflections below Tc, breaking the
reflection condition of the crystal symmetry Pnma. This indicates that the
magnetic structure of YbNiSn is antiferromagnetic-type, rather than the
previously proposed simple collinear ferromagnetic structure. Temperature
dependence of the scattering intensity of the 011 reflection confirmed the
magnetic ordering at 5.77(2) K. No incommensurate satellite reflection was
observed at 2.5 K. By applying external magnetic field of 1 T along the a axis,
the magnetic intensity at the nuclear-forbidden 001 position was suppressed,
while a slight enhancement at the nuclear-allowed 002 position was observed.
This suggests a spin-flip transition under the external magnetic field along
the a axis in YbNiSn. The proposed magnetic structures at zero field and 1 T
correspond to the magnetic space groups of Pn'm'a and Pnm'a', respectively. The
piezomagnetic effect and the switch between the two magnetic space groups by
the external stress, which could be detected by the anomalous Hall effect, are
proposed.

Specifically, an associative knowledge network (AKN), considered interpretable

radio bursts through the plasma emission mechanism. CME shocks, in particular,
are usually associated with type II solar radio bursts. However, on a few
occasions, type II bursts have been reported to occur either in the absence of

constitute a promising class of multiferroic compounds, which, however, mostly
become ferroelectric concomitant with the antiferromagnetic ordering much below

support this claim, we introduce Representational Transfer Potential (RTP),

RTP can measure both positive and negative transfer (interference), and find
that RTP is strongly correlated with changes in translation quality, indicating
that transfer does occur. Furthermore, we investigate data and language
characteristics that are relevant for transfer, and find that multi-parallel
overlap is an important yet under-explored feature. Based on this, we develop a
novel training scheme, which uses an auxiliary similarity loss that encourages

recently shown that an ultrashort laser pulse destroys the magnetization of an
ordered ferromagnet within hundreds of femtoseconds, with the spins losing
angular momentum to circularly-polarized optical phonons as part of the
ultrafast Einstein-de Haas effect. However, the prospect of using such
high-frequency vibrations of the lattice to reciprocally switch magnetization
in a nearby magnetic medium has not yet been experimentally explored. Here we
show that the spontaneous magnetization temporarily gained via the ultrafast
Barnett effect, through the resonant excitation of circularly-polarized optical
phonons in paramagnetic substrates, can be used to permanently reverse the
magnetic state of the substrate-mounted heterostructure. With the handedness of
the phonons steering the direction of magnetic switching, the ultrafast Barnett

ultrafast non-local control over magnetic order.

computation of surface mappings to simple base domains. Given an input mesh and
a convex or star-shaped target domain, AFM installs a (possibly refined)
version of the input connectivity into the target shape, generating a
piece-wise linear mapping between them. The algorithm is inspired by the
advancing front meshing paradigm, which is revisited to operate on two
embeddings at once, thus becoming a tool for compatible mesh generation. AFM
extends the capabilities of existing robust approaches, such as Tutte or
Progressive Embedding, by providing the same theoretical guarantees of
injectivity and at the same time introducing two key advantages: support for a
broader set of target domains (star-shaped polygons) and local mesh refinement,
which is used to automatically open the space of solutions in case a valid
mapping to the target domain does not exist. AFM relies solely on two
topological operators (split and flip), and on the computation of segment
intersections, thus permitting to compute provably injective mappings without
solving any numerical problem. This makes the algorithm predictable, easy to
implement, debug and deploy. We validated the capabilities of AFM extensively,
executing more than one billion advancing front moves on 36K mapping tasks,
proving that our theoretical guarantees nicely transition to a robust and
practical implementation.

alleviates these issues, but the limited context length only allows for a few

Moreover, when there are numerous tools to choose from, in-context learning

approach represents each $\underline{tool}$ as a to$\underline{ken}$

LLM is prompted to complete arguments for the tool to execute. ToolkenGPT
offers the flexibility to plug in an arbitrary number of tools by expanding the

extensive demonstration data for learning the toolken embeddings. In diverse

formulate graphical criteria for identifying causal effects and to derive
algebraic relations with which these frequency domain causal effects can be

knowledge storage from model parameters with an editable and scalable key-value

(OLEDs) strongly influences device performance. However, our understanding of
the factors controlling emitter orientation is limited as current measurements
only provide ensemble-averaged orientation values. Here, we use single-molecule
imaging to measure the transition dipole orientation of individual molecules in
a state-of-the-art thermally evaporated host and thereby obtain complete
orientation distributions of the hyperfluorescence-terminal emitter C545T. We
achieve this by realizing ultra-low doping concentrations (10-6 wt%) of C545T
and minimising background levels to reliably measure the photoluminescence of
the emitter. This approach yields the orientation distributions of >1000
individual emitter molecules in a system relevant to vacuum-processed OLEDs.
Analysis of solution- and vacuum-processed systems reveals that the orientation
distributions strongly depend on the nanoscale environment of the emitter. This
work opens the door to attaining unprecedented information on the factors that
determine emitter orientation in current and future material systems for OLEDs.

uncertainty is a challenging task. Indeed, controllers often do not consider
the estimation uncertainty and only rely on the most likely estimated state.
Consequently, sudden changes in the environment or the robot's dynamics can
lead to catastrophic behaviors. In this work, we present a risk-sensitive
Extended Kalman Filter that allows doing output-feedback Model Predictive
Control (MPC) safely. This filter adapts its estimation to the control
objective. By taking a pessimistic estimate concerning the value function
resulting from the MPC controller, the filter provides increased robustness to
the controller in phases of uncertainty as compared to a standard Extended
Kalman Filter (EKF). Moreover, the filter has the same complexity as an EKF, so
that it can be used for real-time model-predictive control. The paper evaluates
the risk-sensitive behavior of the proposed filter when used in a nonlinear
model-predictive control loop on a planar drone and industrial manipulator in
simulation, as well as on an external force estimation task on a real quadruped
robot. These experiments demonstrate the abilities of the approach to improve
performance in the face of uncertainties significantly.

impressive results in generating high-fidelity images based on consistent text
prompts. However, there is a growing interest in exploring the potential of
these models for more diverse reference-based image manipulation tasks that
require spatial understanding and visual context. Previous approaches have
achieved this by incorporating additional control modules or fine-tuning the
generative models specifically for each task until convergence. In this paper,
we propose a different perspective. We conjecture that current large-scale T2I
generative models already possess the capability to perform these tasks but are
not fully activated within the standard generation process. To unlock these
capabilities, we introduce a unified Prompt-Guided In-Context inpainting (PGIC)
framework, which leverages large-scale T2I models to re-formulate and solve
reference-guided image manipulations. In the PGIC framework, the reference and
masked target are stitched together as a new input for the generative models,
enabling the filling of masked regions as producing final results. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the self-attention modules in T2I models are well-suited
for establishing spatial correlations and efficiently addressing challenging
reference-guided manipulations. These large T2I models can be effectively
driven by task-specific prompts with minimal training cost or even with frozen
backbones. We synthetically evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed PGIC
framework across various tasks, including reference-guided image inpainting,
faithful inpainting, outpainting, local super-resolution, and novel view
synthesis. Our results show that PGIC achieves significantly better performance
while requiring less computation compared to other fine-tuning based
approaches.

derived with collisional excited lines (CELs) and the weaker recombination

elements regulate the cooling of the interstellar gas, being essential to the

  Tweet Summarization",,,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Online social media platforms, such as Twitter, are one of the most valuable
sources of information during disaster events. Therefore, humanitarian
organizations, government agencies, and volunteers rely on a summary of this
information, i.e., tweets, for effective disaster management. Although there
are several existing supervised and unsupervised approaches for automated tweet
summary approaches, these approaches either require extensive labeled
information or do not incorporate specific domain knowledge of disasters.
Additionally, the most recent approaches to disaster summarization have
proposed BERT-based models to enhance the summary quality. However, for further
improved performance, we introduce the utilization of domain-specific knowledge
without any human efforts to understand the importance (salience) of a tweet
which further aids in summary creation and improves summary quality. In this
paper, we propose a disaster-specific tweet summarization framework, IKDSumm,
which initially identifies the crucial and important information from each
tweet related to a disaster through key-phrases of that tweet. We identify
these key-phrases by utilizing the domain knowledge (using existing ontology)
of disasters without any human intervention. Further, we utilize these
key-phrases to automatically generate a summary of the tweets. Therefore, given
tweets related to a disaster, IKDSumm ensures fulfillment of the summarization
key objectives, such as information coverage, relevance, and diversity in
summary without any human intervention. We evaluate the performance of IKDSumm
with 8 state-of-the-art techniques on 12 disaster datasets. The evaluation
results show that IKDSumm outperforms existing techniques by approximately
2-79% in terms of ROUGE-N F1-score.

quantification model is built on top of it to determine fuzzy category
membership and classify instances interpretably. We apply it on a use case from
the manufacturing domain, using objects' physical properties obtained from
cobots' onboard sensors and utilisation properties from crowdsourced

data-efficient representation learning of typically highly specialist or

based on density functional theory. Small cleavage energy for \{beta}-PtS2
(0.44 J/m2) and $\beta$-PtSe$_2$ (0.40 J/m$^2$) endorses the possibility of
their mechanical exfoliation from respective layered bulk material. The
calculated results find \{beta}-PtX2 monolayers to have an appropriate bandgap
(~1.8-2.6 eV) enclosing the water redox potential, light absorption
coefficients (~104 cm$^{-1}$), and excitons binding energy (~0.5-0.7 eV), which
facilitates excellent visible-light driven photocatalytic performance.
Remarkably, an inherent structural anisotropy leads to the anisotropic and high
carrier mobility (up to ~5 x 10$^3$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ S$^{-1}$) leading to fast
transport of photogenerated carriers. Notably, the small required external
potential to derive hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction
processes with an excellent solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency of

candidates for solar water splitting applications.

consistency in the field, indicated by the parallelism of level sets, is the
key factor affecting the inference accuracy. Hence, we propose a level set
alignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be
minimized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novelty lies in that we
can align all level sets to the zero level set by constraining gradients at
queries and their projections on the zero level set in an adaptive way. Our
insight is to propagate the zero level set to everywhere in the field through
consistent gradients to eliminate uncertainty in the field that is caused by
the discreteness of 3D point clouds or the lack of observations from multi-view

wide area of applications. However, they frequently exhibit unfair behaviors in
sensitive application domains, raising severe fairness concerns. To evaluate
and test fairness, engineers often generate individual discriminatory instances
to expose unfair behaviors before model deployment. However, existing baselines
ignore the naturalness of generation and produce instances that deviate from
the real data distribution, which may fail to reveal the actual model fairness
since these unnatural discriminatory instances are unlikely to appear in
practice. To address the problem, this paper proposes a framework named Latent
Imitator (LIMI) to generate more natural individual discriminatory instances
with the help of a generative adversarial network (GAN), where we imitate the
decision boundary of the target model in the semantic latent space of GAN and
further samples latent instances on it. Specifically, we first derive a
surrogate linear boundary to coarsely approximate the decision boundary of the
target model, which reflects the nature of the original data distribution.
Subsequently, to obtain more natural instances, we manipulate random latent
vectors to the surrogate boundary with a one-step movement, and further conduct
vector calculation to probe two potential discriminatory candidates that may be
more closely located in the real decision boundary. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our LIMI outperforms other baselines largely
in effectiveness ($\times$9.42 instances), efficiency ($\times$8.71 speeds),
and naturalness (+19.65%) on average. In addition, we empirically demonstrate
that retraining on test samples generated by our approach can lead to
improvements in both individual fairness (45.67% on $IF_r$ and 32.81% on
$IF_o$) and group fairness (9.86% on $SPD$ and 28.38% on $AOD$}).

stars can interact and collide, stellar evolution and binary stars change the
dynamical evolution, black holes can accumulate in their centers and merge with
relativistic effects becoming important. Recent high-resolution imaging has
revealed even more complex structural properties with respect to stellar

the Milky Way may help to probe the feasibility of the core-accretion mechanism
in the case of massive star formation. The existence of truly isolated stars
may efficiently probe the possibility that individual massive stars can be born
in isolation. Aims: We observed WR67a (hereafter Sapaki), an O3If* star that
appears to be isolated close to the center of a well-developed giant cavity
that is aptly traced by 8.0 $\mu$m hot dust emission. Methods: We acquired
medium-resolution ($R=4100$) and moderate signal-to-noise ($S/N = 95$ at 4500
\r{A}) spectra for Sapaki in the range of 3800-10500 \r{A} with the Magellan
Echellette (MagE) at Las Campanas Observatory. We computed the line-of-sight
total extinctions. Additionally, we restricted its heliocentric distance by
using a range of different estimators. Moreover, we measured its radial
velocity from several lines in its spectrum. Finally, we analyzed its proper
motions from Gaia to examine its possible runaway status. Results: The star has
been classified as having the spectral type O3If* given its resemblance to
standard examples of the class. In addition, we found that Sapaki is highly
obscured, reaching a line-of-sight extinction value of $A_{V} = 7.87$. We
estimated the heliocentric distance to be in the range of $d = 4-7$ kpc. We
also estimated its radial velocity to be $V_{r} = -34.2 \pm 15.6$ km/s. We may
also discard its runaway status solely based on its 2D kinematics. Furthermore,
by analyzing proper motions and parallaxes provided by Gaia, we found only one
other star with compatible measurements. Conclusions: Given its apparent
non-runaway status and the absence of clustering, Sapaki appears to be a solid
candidate for isolated high-mass star formation in the Milky Way.

appropriate band gap of donor material in case of

designed to perform experimental tests in practical environments. The carrier
frequency is set as 3.5GHz, and the RIS array possesses 256 units, each of

self-developed broadband intelligent communication system 40MHz-Net (BICT-40N)
terminal in order to fully acquire the channel information. The terminal mainly
includes a baseband board and a radio frequency (RF) front-end board, where the
latter can achieve 26 dB transmitting link gain and 33 dB receiving link gain.
The orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is used for the
terminal, where the bandwidth is 40MHz and the subcarrier spacing is 625KHz.
Also, the terminal supports a series of modulation modes, including QPSK, QAM,

the RIS as follows. First, we validate a novel RIS power consumption model,
which considers both the static and the dynamic power consumption. Besides, we
demonstrate the existence of the imaging interference and find that two-bit RIS
can lower the imaging interference about 10 dBm. Moreover, we verify that the
RIS can outperform the metal plate in terms of the beam focusing performance.
In addition, we find that the RIS has the ability to improve the channel
stationarity. Then, we realize the multi-beam reflection of the RIS utilizing
the pattern addition (PA) algorithm. Lastly, we validate the existence of the
mutual coupling between different RIS units.

  arXiv:2212.09458",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model substructure learning aims to find an invariant network substructure
that can have better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization than the original
full structure. Existing works usually search the invariant substructure using
modular risk minimization (MRM) with fully exposed out-domain data, which may
bring about two drawbacks: 1) Unfairness, due to the dependence of the full
exposure of out-domain data; and 2) Sub-optimal OOD generalization, due to the
equally feature-untargeted pruning on the whole data distribution. Based on the
idea that in-distribution (ID) data with spurious features may have a lower
experience risk, in this paper, we propose a novel Spurious Feature-targeted
model Pruning framework, dubbed SFP, to automatically explore invariant
substructures without referring to the above drawbacks. Specifically, SFP
identifies spurious features within ID instances during training using our
theoretically verified task loss, upon which, SFP attenuates the corresponding
feature projections in model space to achieve the so-called spurious
feature-targeted pruning. This is typically done by removing network branches
with strong dependencies on identified spurious features, thus SFP can push the
model learning toward invariant features and pull that out of spurious features
and devise optimal OOD generalization. Moreover, we also conduct detailed
theoretical analysis to provide the rationality guarantee and a proof framework
for OOD structures via model sparsity, and for the first time, reveal how a
highly biased data distribution affects the model's OOD generalization.
Experiments on various OOD datasets show that SFP can significantly outperform
both structure-based and non-structure-based OOD generalization SOTAs, with
accuracy improvement up to 4.72% and 23.35%, respectively

redefine the optimization problem by introducing a new objective function,
where a similarity metric is used to construct a similarity loss. This guides
the patch to follow predefined patterns while maximizing the victim model's
loss function. Our technique is based on directly modifying the pixel values in
the patch which gives higher flexibility and larger space to incorporate
multiple transformations compared to the GAN-based techniques. Furthermore,
most clothing-based physical attacks assume static objects and ignore the
possible transformations caused by non-rigid deformation due to changes in a
person's pose. To address this limitation, we incorporate a ``Creases
Transformation'' (CT) block, i.e., a preprocessing block following an
Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) block used to generate a large variation
of transformed patches incorporated in the training process to increase its
robustness to different possible real-world distortions (e.g., creases in the
clothing, rotation, re-scaling, random noise, brightness and contrast
variations, etc.). We demonstrate that the presence of different real-world
variations in clothing and object poses (i.e., above-mentioned distortions)
lead to a drop in the performance of state-of-the-art attacks. For instance,
these techniques can merely achieve 20\% in the physical world and 30.8\% in

ConvBN blocks: Deploy mode is efficient but suffers from training instability;
Eval mode is widely used in transfer learning but lacks efficiency. To solve

high-performance architectured ceramics using machine learning (ML) with data
from finite element analysis (FEA). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are used as the deep learning approaches. A
limited set of FEA simulation data containing a variety of architectural design
parameters is used to train our neural networks, including learning how
independent and dependent design parameters are related. A trained network is
then used to predict the optimum structure from the configurations. A FEA
simulation is run on the best predictions of both MLP and CNN algorithms to
evaluate the performance of our networks. Although a limited amount of
simulation data are available, our networks are effective in predicting the
transient thermo-mechanical responses of possible panel designs. For example,
the optimal design after using CNN prediction resulted in $\approx \! 30\%$
improvement in terms of edge temperature.

used to formulate a goal-oriented communication problem. Specifically, we
incorporate the risk-averse nature of participants and obtain a
communication-efficient on-device performance, while relying on feedback from
the Parameter Server (\texttt{PS}). A client has to decide its transmission
plan on when not to participate in FL. This is based on its intrinsic
incentive, which is the value of the trained global model upon participation by
this client. Poor updates not only plunge the performance of the global model
with added communication cost but also propagate the loss in performance on
other participating devices. We cast the relevance of local updates as
\emph{semantic information} for developing local transmission strategies, i.e.,
making a decision on when to ``not transmit"". The devices use feedback about
the state of the PS and evaluate their contributions in training the learning
model in each aggregation period, which eventually lowers the number of
occupied connections. Simulation results validate the efficacy of our proposed
approach, with up to $1.4\times$ gain in communication links utilization as

optimization is a powerful tool enabling Region of Attraction estimation for

shape function within the Sum-of-Squares procedure helps to find a richer
representation of the Lyapunov function and a larger corresponding Region of
Attraction estimation. However, existing Sum-of-Squares optimization techniques
demonstrate very conservative results. The main novelty of this paper is the
Union theorem which enables the use of multiple shape functions to create a
polynomial Lyapunov function encompassing all the areas generated by the shape
functions. The main contribution of this paper is a novel
computationally-efficient numerical method for Region of Attraction estimation,
which remarkably improves estimation performance and overcomes limitations of
existing methods, while maintaining the resultant Lyapunov function polynomial,
thus facilitating control system design and construction of control Lyapunov
function with enhanced Region of Attraction using conventional Sum-of-Squares

the numerical algorithm of Region of Attraction estimation is provided. The

Unpredictable actions, that is, actions that the algorithm could not correctly

training data is limited, deep neural generative networks overfit and tend to

Unfortunately, abundant 3D shape data is typically hard to obtain as well. In

adapting generative models pre-trained on large source domains to target

achieve generated shapes with diverse topology and textures. Moreover, we
introduce several metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of few-shot 3D

This makes it possible to perform quite realistic simulations of radio pulses

languages. Gender and racial biases are well-studied in English SA systems, but
understudied in other languages, with few resources for such studies. To remedy
this, we build a counterfactual evaluation corpus for gender and racial/migrant
bias in four languages. We demonstrate its usefulness by answering a simple but
important question that an engineer might need to answer when deploying a
system: What biases do systems import from pre-trained models when compared to
a baseline with no pre-training? Our evaluation corpus, by virtue of being
counterfactual, not only reveals which models have less bias, but also
pinpoints changes in model bias behaviour, which enables more targeted
mitigation strategies. We release our code and evaluation corpora to facilitate
future research.

  State Estimation Errors","This work has been submitted to Elsevier for possible publication.
  Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this version may no
  longer be accessible",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vehicle teleoperation has numerous potential applications, including serving
as a backup solution for autonomous vehicles, facilitating remote delivery
services, and enabling hazardous remote operations. However, complex urban
scenarios, limited situational awareness, and network delay increase the
cognitive workload of human operators and degrade teleoperation performance. To
address this, the successive reference pose tracking (SRPT) approach was
introduced in earlier work, which transmits successive reference poses to the
remote vehicle instead of steering commands. The operator generates reference
poses online with the help of a joystick steering and an augmented display,
potentially mitigating the detrimental effects of delays. However, it is not
clear which minimal set of sensors is essential for the SRPT vehicle
teleoperation control loop.
  This paper tests the robustness of the SRPT approach in the presence of state
estimation inaccuracies, environmental disturbances, and measurement noises.
The simulation environment, implemented in Simulink, features a 14-dof vehicle
model and incorporates difficult maneuvers such as tight corners, double-lane
changes, and slalom. Environmental disturbances include low adhesion track
regions and strong cross-wind gusts. The results demonstrate that the SRPT
approach, using either estimated or actual states, performs similarly under
various worst-case scenarios, even without a position sensor requirement.
Additionally, the designed state estimator ensures sufficient performance with
just an inertial measurement unit, wheel speed encoder, and steer encoder,
constituting a minimal set of essential sensors for the SRPT vehicle
teleoperation control loop.

spatiotemporal information from continuous fMRI data of the cerebral cortex
progressively through masked brain modeling, multimodal contrastive learning
with spatiotemporal attention, and co-training with an augmented Stable
Diffusion model that incorporates network temporal inflation. We show that
high-quality videos of arbitrary frame rates can be reconstructed with
Mind-Video using adversarial guidance. The recovered videos were evaluated with
various semantic and pixel-level metrics. We achieved an average accuracy of
85% in semantic classification tasks and 0.19 in structural similarity index

our model is biologically plausible and interpretable, reflecting established

composited images by adaptively adjusting the foreground pixels with the
background as references. Existing methods employ local color transformation or
region matching between foreground and background, which neglects powerful
proximity prior and independently distinguishes fore-/back-ground as a whole
part for harmonization. As a result, they still show a limited performance
across varied foreground objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Global-aware Kernel Network (GKNet) to harmonize local regions with
comprehensive consideration of long-distance background references.
Specifically, GKNet includes two parts, \ie, harmony kernel prediction and
harmony kernel modulation branches. The former includes a Long-distance
Reference Extractor (LRE) to obtain long-distance context and Kernel Prediction
Blocks (KPB) to predict multi-level harmony kernels by fusing global
information with local features. To achieve this goal, a novel Selective
Correlation Fusion (SCF) module is proposed to better select relevant
long-distance background references for local harmonization. The latter employs
the predicted kernels to harmonize foreground regions with both local and
global awareness. Abundant experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method for image harmonization over state-of-the-art methods, \eg, achieving
39.53dB PSNR that surpasses the best counterpart by +0.78dB $\uparrow$;
decreasing fMSE/MSE by 11.5\%$\downarrow$/6.7\%$\downarrow$ compared with the
SoTA method. Code will be available at

offer an avenue to achieve the long-sought goal of superconductivity at room

electronic properties, lattice dynamics and superconductivity of the ternary
Ca-Al-H system using ab initio methods. We found two stable ternary hydrides at
50 GPa: Cmcm-CaAlH5 and Pnnm-CaAl2H8, which both are semiconductors. At 200
GPa, a new phase of P21/m-CaAlH5, P4/mmm-CaAlH7 and a metastable compound
Immm-Ca2AlH12 were found. Furthermore, P4/mmm-CaAlH7 has obvious phonon
softening of high frequency vibrations along the Z-A direction, point A and
point X, which improves the strength of electron-phonon coupling. Therefore, a
superconducting transition temperature Tc of 71 K is generated at 50 GPa. In
addition, the thermodynamic metastable Immm-Ca2AlH12 exhibits a superconducting
transition temperature of 118 K at 250 GPa. These results are very useful for
the experimental searching of new high-Tc superconductors in ternary hydrides.

electrons, are extremely sensitive probes of nuclear structure, because the
large muon mass increases tremendously the wave function overlap with the
nucleus. Using pulsed laser spectroscopy we have measured three 2S-2P
transitions in the muonic helium-3 ion ($\mu^3$He$^+$), an ion formed by a
negative muon and bare helium-3 nucleus. This allowed us to extract the Lamb
shift $E(2P_{1/2}-2S_{1/2})= 1258.598(48)^{\rm exp}(3)^{\rm theo}$ meV, the 2P
fine structure splitting $E_{\rm FS}^{\rm exp} = 144.958(114)$ meV, and the
2S-hyperfine splitting (HFS) $E_{\rm HFS}^{\rm exp} = -166.495(104)^{\rm
exp}(3)^{\rm theo}$ meV in $\mu^3$He$^+$. Comparing these measurements to
theory we determine the rms charge radius of the helion ($^3$He nucleus) to be
$r_h$ = 1.97007(94) fm. This radius represents a benchmark for few nucleon
theories and opens the way for precision tests in $^3$He atoms and $^3$He-ions.
This radius is in good agreement with the value from elastic electron
scattering, but a factor 15 more accurate. Combining our Lamb shift measurement
with our earlier one in $\mu^4$He$^+$ we obtain $r_h^2-r_\alpha^2 =
1.0636(6)^{\rm exp}(30)^{\rm theo}$ fm$^2$ to be compared to results from the
isotope shift measurements in regular He atoms, which are however affected by
long-standing tensions. By comparing $E_{\rm HFS}^{\rm exp}$ with theory we
also obtain the two-photon-exchange contribution (including higher orders)
which is another important benchmark for ab-initio few-nucleon theories aiming
at understanding the magnetic and current structure of light nuclei.

programming, known for its success in various task domains such as program
synthesis, symbolic regression, and machine learning. Due to its non-parametric
and recursive nature, calculating the probability of each individual being
selected by lexicase selection has been proven to be an NP-hard problem, which
discourages deeper theoretical understanding and practical improvements to the
algorithm. In this work, we introduce probabilistic lexicase selection
(plexicase selection), a novel parent selection algorithm that efficiently
approximates the probability distribution of lexicase selection. Our method not
only demonstrates superior problem-solving capabilities as a semantic-aware
selection method, but also benefits from having a probabilistic representation
of the selection process for enhanced efficiency and flexibility. Experiments
are conducted in two prevalent domains in genetic programming: program
synthesis and symbolic regression, using standard benchmarks including PSB and
SRBench. The empirical results show that plexicase selection achieves
state-of-the-art problem-solving performance that is competitive to the
lexicase selection, and significantly outperforms lexicase selection in
computation efficiency.

researchers in real-life problems (e.g., fraud detection, credit scoring) is to

needs to accompany the used machine learning model. In this concern, often,
intrinsically interpretable models are preferred to complex ones, which are in
most cases black-box models. Also, linear models are used in some high-risk
fields to handle tabular data, even if performance must be sacrificed. In this
paper, we introduce Self-Reinforcement Attention (SRA), a novel attention
mechanism that provides a relevance of features as a weight vector which is
used to learn an intelligible representation. This weight is then used to
reinforce or reduce some components of the raw input through element-wise
vector multiplication. Our results on synthetic and real-world imbalanced data

an essential diagnostic tool for the coronal heating properties. A puzzling
feature of the solar corona, besides the heating, is its EUV filamentary
structure and variability. We aim to identify observable features of the TNE-TI
scenario underlying coronal rain at small and large spatial scales, to
understand the role it plays in the solar corona. We use EUV datasets at
unprecedented spatial resolution of ~240 km from EUI/HRIEUV and SPICE of Solar
Orbiter from the spring 2022 perihelion. EUV absorption features produced by
coronal rain are detected at scales as small as 260 km. As the rain falls,
heating and compression is produced immediately downstream, leading to a small
EUV brightening accompanying the fall and producing a ""fireball"" phenomenon.
Just prior to impact, a flash-like EUV brightening downstream of the rain,
lasting a few minutes is observed for the fastest events. For the first time,
we detect the atmospheric response to the rain's impact on the chromosphere and
consists of upward propagating rebound shocks and flows partly reheating the
loop. The observed widths of the rain clumps are 500 +- 200 km. They exhibit a
broad velocity distribution of 10 - 150 km s^-1, peaking below 50 km s^-1.
Coronal strands of similar widths are observed along the same loops co-spatial
with cool filamentary structure, which we interpret as the CCTR. Matching with
the expected cooling, prior to the rain appearance sequential loop brightenings
are detected in gradually cooler lines from corona to chromospheric
temperatures. Despite the large rain showers, most cannot be detected in AIA
171 in quadrature, indicating that LOS effects play a major role in coronal
rain visibility. Still, AIA 304 and SPICE observations reveal that only a small
fraction of the rain can be captured by HRIEUV.

develop a surgical question-answering system to facilitate robot-assisted
surgical scene and activity understanding from recorded videos. Most of the
existing VQA methods require an object detector and regions based feature
extractor to extract visual features and fuse them with the embedded text of
the question for answer generation. However, (1) surgical object detection
model is scarce due to smaller datasets and lack of bounding box annotation;
(2) current fusion strategy of heterogeneous modalities like text and image is
naive; (3) the localized answering is missing, which is crucial in complex
surgical scenarios. In this paper, we propose Visual Question

surgical area during the answer prediction. To deal with the fusion of the
heterogeneous modalities, we design gated vision-language embedding (GVLE) to
build input patches for the Language Vision Transformer (LViT) to predict the
answer. To get localization, we add the detection head in parallel with the
prediction head of the LViT. We also integrate GIoU loss to boost localization
performance by preserving the accuracy of the question-answering model. We
annotate two datasets of VQLA by utilizing publicly available surgical videos
from MICCAI challenges EndoVis-17 and 18. Our validation results suggest that
Surgical-VQLA can better understand the surgical scene and localize the
specific area related to the question-answering. GVLE presents an efficient
language-vision embedding technique by showing superior performance over the
existing benchmarks.

distance between the pole and the physical region in the complex energy plane,
not the imaginary part of the pole energy, which determines not only the energy
spectrum of the Green's function but also the survival probability. The
survival probability of the ""threshold-cusp"" caused by a pole on the unusual

expertise of microbiology, ecology, psychiatry, computational biology, and
epidemiology amongst other disciplines. As the field matures and moves beyond a
basic demonstration of its relevance, it is critical that study design and
analysis are robust and foster reproducibility.
  In this companion piece to Bugs as Features (Part 1), we present techniques
from adjacent and disparate fields to enrich and inform the analysis of
microbiome-gut-brain-axis data. Emerging techniques built specifically for the
microbiome-gut-brain axis are also demonstrated. All of these methods are
contextualised to inform several common challenges: how do we establish
causality? How can we integrate data from multiple 'omics techniques? How might
we account for the dynamicism of host-microbiome interactions?
  This perspective is offered to experienced and emerging microbiome scientists
alike, to assist with these questions and others, at the study conception,
design, analysis and interpretation stages of research.

higher temperatures. This is mainly because they have adopted a limited range
of electron energies for the calculations of collision strengths. We

not be adopted in any applications or modelling analysis.

from their dielectric constant {\epsilon} being equal, or at least very close,

displayed in this 'epsilon-near-zero' (ENZ) regime makes it possible to create
ultrafast albeit transient optical switches. An outstanding question, however,
relates to whether one could use the amplification of light-matter interactions
at the ENZ conditions to achieve permanent switching. Here, we demonstrate that
an ultrafast excitation under ENZ conditions can induce permanent all-optical
reversal of ferroelectric polarization between different stable states. Our
reliance on ENZ conditions that naturally emerge from the solid's ionic
lattice, rather than specific material properties, suggests that the
demonstrated mechanism of reversal is truly universal, being capable of
permanently switching order parameters in a wide variety of systems.

feature matching approaches commonly lead to numerous outlier correspondences,
making outlier-robust registration techniques indispensable. Many recent
studies have adopted the branch and bound (BnB) optimization framework to solve
the correspondence-based point cloud registration problem globally and
deterministically. Nonetheless, BnB-based methods are time-consuming to search
the entire 6-dimensional parameter space, since their computational complexity
is exponential to the dimension of the solution domain. In order to enhance
algorithm efficiency, existing works attempt to decouple the 6 degrees of
freedom (DOF) original problem into two 3-DOF sub-problems, thereby reducing
the dimension of the parameter space. In contrast, our proposed approach
introduces a novel pose decoupling strategy based on residual projections,
effectively decomposing the raw problem into three 2-DOF rotation search
sub-problems. Subsequently, we employ a novel BnB-based search method to solve
these sub-problems, achieving efficient and deterministic registration.
Furthermore, our method can be adapted to address the challenging problem of
simultaneous pose and correspondence registration (SPCR). Through extensive
experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that
our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
efficiency, while simultaneously ensuring robustness.

two-stage generation paradigm that first learns a codebook to encode images as

However, they encode fixed-size image regions into fixed-length codes and
ignore their naturally different information densities, which results in
insufficiency in important regions and redundancy in unimportant ones, and
finally degrades the generation quality and speed. Moreover, the fixed-length
coding leads to an unnatural raster-scan autoregressive generation. To address

VAE (DQ-VAE) which encodes image regions into variable-length codes based on
their information densities for an accurate and compact code representation.
(2) DQ-Transformer which thereby generates images autoregressively from
coarse-grained (smooth regions with fewer codes) to fine-grained (details
regions with more codes) by modeling the position and content of codes in each
granularity alternately, through a novel stacked-transformer architecture and
shared-content, non-shared position input layers designs. Comprehensive

most highly researched materials, yet electronic structure investigations of
conducting polymers are still uncommon. The bipolaron model has traditionally
been the dominant attempt to explain the electronic structure of PEDOT. Though
recent theoretical studies have begun to move away from this model, some
aspects remain commonplace, such as the concepts of bipolarons or polaron
pairs. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the
electronic structure of undoped and AlCl4- doped PEDOT oligomers. By
considering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or doping level and
spin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in
PEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model. Instead, we find that a single or
twin peak structural distortion can occur at any oxidation or doping level.
Rather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs, these are electron
distributions driven by a range of factors, which also disproves the concept of
polaron pairs. Localisation of distortions does occur in the doped case,
although distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions.
Furthermore, conductivity in conducting polymers has been experimentally
observed to reduce at very high doping levels. We show that at high anion
concentrations, the non-bonding orbitals of the anions cluster below the
HOMO-LUMO gap and begin to mix into the HOMO of the overall system. We propose
that this mixing of highly localised anionic orbitals into the HOMO reduces the
conductivity of the polymer and contributes to the reduced conductivity
previously observed.

physical entropy is matter-gravity entanglement entropy and that this may offer
an explanation of entropy increase both for the black hole collapse and
evaporation system and also for other closed unitarily evolving systems. For
this to work, the matter-gravity entanglement entropy of the late-time state of
black hole evaporation would have to be larger than the entropy of the freshly
formed black hole. We argue that this may possibly be the case due to (usually
neglected) photon-graviton interactions.

involving resonance states within the complex absorbing potential
equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (CAP-EOM-CC) framework implemented within
the singles and doubles approximation. Resonance states are embedded in the
continuum and undergo rapid decay through autodetachment. In addition, nuclear
motions can facilitate transitions between different resonances and between
resonances and bound states. These non-adiabatic transitions affect the
chemical fate of resonances and have distinct spectroscopic signatures. The NAC
vector is a central quantity needed to model such effects.
  In the CAP-EOM-CC framework, resonance states are treated on the same footing
as bound states. Using the example of fumaronitrile, which supports a bound
radical anion and several anionic resonances, we analyze the non-adiabatic
coupling between bound states and pseudocontinuum states, between bound states
and resonances and between two resonances. We find that the NAC between a bound
state and a resonance is nearly independent of the CAP strength and thus
straightforward to evaluate whereas the NAC between two resonance states or
between a bound state and a pseudocontinuum state is more difficult to
evaluate.

an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4}(1+P_T))$ dynamic regret bound, where $P_T$ denotes the
path-length of the comparator sequence. Then, we improve the upper bound to
$\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4}(1+P_T)^{1/4})$ by running multiple $\text{BOGD}_\text{IP}$
algorithms with different step sizes in parallel, and tracking the best one on
the fly. Our results are the first general-case dynamic regret bounds for

$\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ static regret by setting $P_T = 0$. Furthermore, we
propose a projection-free method to attain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\tau^{3/4})$
adaptive regret bound for any interval with length $\tau$, which nearly matches
the static regret over that interval. The essential idea is to maintain a set
of $\text{BOGD}_\text{IP}$ algorithms dynamically, and combine them by a meta

though they have achieved great success on balanced data. We observe that
vanilla training on long-tailed data with cross-entropy loss makes the
instance-rich head classes severely squeeze the spatial distribution of the
tail classes, which leads to difficulty in classifying tail class samples.
Furthermore, the original cross-entropy loss can only propagate gradient
short-lively because the gradient in softmax form rapidly approaches zero as
the logit difference increases. This phenomenon is called softmax saturation.
It is unfavorable for training on balanced data, but can be utilized to adjust
the validity of the samples in long-tailed data, thereby solving the distorted
embedding space of long-tailed problems. To this end, this paper proposes the
Gaussian clouded logit adjustment by Gaussian perturbation of different class
logits with varied amplitude. We define the amplitude of perturbation as cloud
size and set relatively large cloud sizes to tail classes. The large cloud size
can reduce the softmax saturation and thereby making tail class samples more
active as well as enlarging the embedding space. To alleviate the bias in a

sometimes select outcomes that yield essentially no value for constituents. In
this paper, we show that this problem is mitigated by voters being

the common good in addition to their own interests. We first generalize the
standard voting model to capture this public-spirited voting behavior. In this

senses, monotonically - reduce the distortion of several voting rules. Notably,
these results include the finding that if voters are at all public-spirited,
some voting rules have constant distortion in the number of alternatives.
Further, we demonstrate that these benefits are robust to adversarial

bi-encoder network first retrieves K (e.g., 100) candidates that are then
re-ranked using a more powerful cross-encoder model to rank the better
candidates higher. The re-ranker generally produces better candidate scores
than the retriever, but is limited to seeing only the top K retrieved
candidates, thus providing no improvements in retrieval performance as measured
by Recall@K. In this work, we leverage the re-ranker to also improve retrieval
by providing inference-time relevance feedback to the retriever. Concretely, we
update the retriever's query representation for a test instance using a
lightweight inference-time distillation of the re-ranker's prediction for that
instance. The distillation loss is designed to bring the retriever's candidate
scores closer to those of the re-ranker. A second retrieval step is then
performed with the updated query vector. We empirically show that our approach,
which can serve arbitrary retrieve-and-rerank pipelines, significantly improves
retrieval recall in multiple domains, languages, and modalities.

the future state of rich, ethologically-relevant environments, ranging from
self-supervised end-to-end models with pixel-wise or object-centric objectives,
to models that future predict in the latent space of purely static image-based

differentiation across these model classes in their ability to predict neural

we find that neural responses are currently best predicted by models trained to

Notably, models that future predict in the latent space of video foundation

consider the availability of real-time binary Occupancy Indicator (OI)
information, signaling if a CS is busy or not. At each OI update, we determine
the sequence of CSs to visit along with associated charging quantities. We name
the resulting problem the Electric Vehicle Shortest Path Problem with charging

consider that the EV is allowed to partially charge its battery, and we model
charging times via piecewise linear charging functions that depend on the CS

reoptimization algorithm that establishes the sequence of CS visits and
charging amounts based on system updates. Specifically, we propose a
simulation-based approach to estimate the waiting time of the EV at a CS as a
function of its arrival time. As the path to a CS may consist of multiple
intermediate CS stops, estimating the arrival times at each CS is fairly

systems expands, the primary hurdle that emerges is the assurance of circuit
reliability. Various facets of quantum computing, from circuit design to
multi-qubit mapping strategies, have aimed at bolstering reliability through
assorted optimizations. Quantum classical circuits, a key type of quantum
circuits, have been previously studied with the aim of enhancing reliability by
reusing ancilla-qubits and employing a variety of strategies to optimize the
size and depth of the circuit. However, even the most sophisticated
optimization strategies may not yield reliable results for large-scale
circuits.
  Classical Quantum Circuit Depth Control (DC), proposed and evaluated in this
paper, seeks to confront this critical issue. The DC approach breaks a given
classical circuit into segments, and limits its depth, thereby ensuring
reliable output and reduced mapping costs for real quantum hardware. In
addition, DC can deliver reliable output for quantum classical circuits of any
depth on any NISQ system. Our trials with DC indicate that it consistently
renders reliable output for quantum classical circuits that previously showed
minimal or no reliability in output. Importantly, DC ensures the attainment of
the expected output with a Probability of Successful Trial (PST) greater than
50\% for baseline circuits that otherwise yield no reliable output. DC
achieves, on average, an 11x PST improvement compared to the non-segmented
baseline, while guaranteeing the correct output with a significant lead over
the second most common result. Furthermore, by reducing the number of gates per
segment under DC, all mapping/routing optimizations can be completed in
polynomial time, as confirmed by our theoretical analysis. This accomplishment
was previously out of reach with mapping/routing techniques, which required
exponential time.

  Recently a new machine learning algorithm, called the Tsetlin machine, has

intelligence hardware design by suitably tuning the hyperparameters, while
maintaining high learning efficacy. To demonstrate interpretability, we use
reachability and game-theoretic analysis in two simulation environments: a
SystemC model to study the bounded state transitions in the presence of
hardware faults and Nash equilibrium between states to analyze the learning
convergence. Our analyses provides the first insights into conflicting design
tradeoffs involved in energy-efficient and interpretable decision models for
this new artificial intelligence hardware architecture. We show that frugal

grave financial and societal ramifications. Depression detection is key for
early intervention to mitigate those consequences. Such a high-stake decision
inherently necessitates interpretability, which most existing methods fall
short of. To connect human expertise in this decision-making, safeguard trust
from end users, and ensure algorithm transparency, we develop an interpretable
deep learning model: Multi-Scale Temporal Prototype Network (MSTPNet). MSTPNet
is built upon the emergent prototype learning methods. In line with the medical
practice of depression diagnosis, MSTPNet differs from existing prototype
learning models in its capability of capturing the depressive symptoms and
their temporal distribution such as frequency and persistence of appearance.
Extensive empirical analyses using real-world social media data show that
MSTPNet outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in depression detection, with
an F1-score of 0.851. Moreover, MSTPNet interprets its prediction by
identifying what depression symptoms the user presents and how long these
related symptoms last. We further conduct a user study to demonstrate its
superiority over the benchmarks in interpretability. Methodologically, this
study contributes to extant literature with a novel interpretable deep learning
model for depression detection in social media. Our proposed method can be
implemented in social media platforms to detect depression and its symptoms.
Platforms can subsequently provide personalized online resources such as
educational and supporting videos and articles, or sources for treatments and

(Zwicker method, ISO532B, 1975). Since ISO 532 had been revised to contain the
Zwicker method (ISO 5321) and Moore-Glasberg method (ISO 532-2) in 2017, the
classical computational SQM model should also be revised in accordance with
these revisions. A roex auditory filterbank used with the Moore-Glasberg method
is defined separately in the frequency domain not to have impulse responses. It
is therefore difficult to construct a computational SQM model, e.g., the
classical computational SQM model, on the basis of ISO 532-2. We propose a
method for calculating loudness using the time-domain gammatone or gammachirp
auditory filterbank instead of the roex auditory filterbank to solve this
problem. We also propose three computational SQM models based on ISO 532-2 to
use with the proposed loudness method. We evaluated the root-mean squared
errors (RMSEs) of the calculated loudness with the proposed and Moore-Glasberg

considered as a time-domain method for calculating loudness on the basis of ISO
532-2 because the RMSEs are very small. We also found that the proposed
computational SQM models can effectively account for the human data of SQMs

a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE). Importantly, our method finds
smooth dynamics that can predict cognitive processes with accuracy higher than

projections to the latent space enhance performance for specific tasks,
offering a promising direction for future research. We evaluate our approach on
various task-fMRI datasets, including motor, working memory, and relational

we replace the NODE with a recurrent neural network (RNN) and compare the two

the optimal path, which takes minimum time to reach his destination. On the
contrary, police/defenders try to interdict the criminal on his escape route.
This is a challenging task for police with limited resources. Again, a real
city road network is also complex in nature. First, we develop a
simulation-based model for the optimal allocation of resources using the SUMO
simulator. Next, we focus on developing a more advanced search strategy like
routing with optimal resource allocation. We develop a novel meta-heuristic
approach in a simulation environment to interdict the attacker in a dynamic
crime scenario. Like the previous approach, the attacker follows the path with
optimal time to escape from the city. In contrast, defenders try to catch the
attacker regardless of the path which the attacker takes. The defenders aim is
to maximize the interdiction probability. As time plays a vital role, we choose
a meta-heuristic approach to provide quality solutions in a time-efficient
manner. We test the developed meta-heuristic with a case study on the IIT

show that complex infection dynamics can also occur in the endemic state of
seasonal diseases when including human behaviour. We implement human behaviour
as a feedback between incidence and disease mitigation and study the system as
an epidemiological oscillator driven by seasonality. When behaviour and
seasonality have a comparable impact, we find a rich structure in parameter and

we demonstrate that if a disease requires active mitigation, balancing costs of

fire and smoke digital twin model for Austin. We work in cooperation with the
City of Austin Fire Department to ensure the accuracy of our forecast and also
show that air quality sensor density within our cities cannot validate urban
fire presence. We additionally release code and methodology to replicate these
results for any city in the world. This work paves the path for similar digital
twin models to be developed and deployed to better protect the health and
safety of citizens.

X-ray binary systems is generally analysed within the framework of the
so-called ``theory of propagating fluctuations''. In this paper we derive the
Fourier transforms of the Green's function solutions of the thin disc
equations. These solutions suffice to describe all possible solutions through
standard convolution techniques. Solutions are found for both Newtonian discs
and general relativistic solutions with a vanishing ISCO stress. We use this
new relativistic theory to highlight the Kerr black hole spin dependence of a
number of observable variability properties of black hole discs. The phase
lags, coherence, and power density spectra of Kerr discs are shown to be strong
functions of black hole spin. Observations of the aperiodic variability of
black hole accretion sources may now, at least in principle, offer a new avenue
to directly constrain black hole spins.

  Classification",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous studies are aimed at diagnosing heart diseases based on 12-lead
electrocardiographic (ECG) records using deep learning methods. These studies
usually use specific datasets that differ in size and parameters, such as
patient metadata, number of doctors annotating ECGs, types of devices for ECG
recording, data preprocessing techniques, etc. It is well-known that
high-quality deep neural networks trained on one ECG dataset do not necessarily
perform well on another dataset or clinical settings. In this paper, we propose
a methodology to improve the quality of heart disease prediction regardless of
the dataset by training neural networks on a variety of datasets with further
fine-tuning for the specific dataset. To show its applicability, we train
different neural networks on a large private dataset TIS containing various ECG
records from multiple hospitals and on a relatively small public dataset
PTB-XL. We demonstrate that training the networks on a large dataset and
fine-tuning it on a small dataset from another source outperforms the networks
trained only on one small dataset. We also show how the ability of a deep
neural networks to generalize allows to improve classification quality of more
diseases.

  Simulation Model of Human Memory in AI",,,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There are two approaches for simulating memory as well as learning in
artificial intelligence; the functionalistic approach and the cognitive
approach. The necessary condition to put the second approach into account is to
provide a model of brain activity that contains a quite good congruence with
observational facts such as mistakes and forgotten experiences. Given that
human memory has a solid core that includes the components of our identity, our
family and our hometown, the major and determinative events of our lives, and
the countless repeated and accepted facts of our culture, the more we go to the
peripheral spots the data becomes flimsier and more easily exposed to oblivion.
It was essential to propose a model in which the topographical differences are
quite distinguishable. In our proposed model, we have translated this
topographical situation into quantities, which are attributed to the nodes. The
result is an edge-weighted graph with mass-based values on the nodes which
demonstrates the importance of each atomic proposition, as a truth, for an
intelligent being. Furthermore, it dynamically develops and modifies, and in
successive phases, it changes the mass of the nodes and weight of the edges
depending on gathered inputs from the environment.

with uncertain data, commonly used in information systems, decision-making, and
medical care. Three-way decision gets much research in traditional rough set
models. However, three-way decision is rarely combined with the currently
popular field of machine learning to expand its research. In this paper,
three-way decision is connected with SVM, a standard binary classification
model in machine learning, for solving imbalanced classification problems that
SVM needs to improve. A new three-way fuzzy membership function and a new fuzzy
twin support vector machine with three-way membership (TWFTSVM) are proposed.
The new three-way fuzzy membership function is defined to increase the
certainty of uncertain data in both input space and feature space, which
assigns higher fuzzy membership to minority samples compared with majority
samples. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, comparative
experiments are designed for forty-seven different datasets with varying
imbalance ratios. In addition, datasets with different imbalance ratios are
derived from the same dataset to further assess the proposed model's
performance. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms
other traditional SVM-based methods.

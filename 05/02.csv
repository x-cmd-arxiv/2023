particles dispersed in a Newtonian fluid leads to different coating regimes
depending on the ratio of the particle diameter to the thickness of the film
entrained on the substrate. In particular, dilute particles dispersed in the
liquid are entrained only above a threshold value of film thickness. In the
case of anisotropic particles, in particular fibers, the smallest
characteristic dimension will control the entrainment of the particle.
Furthermore, it is possible to control the orientation of the anisotropic
particles depending on the substrate geometry. To test the hypotheses, we
performed dip-coating experiments with dilute suspensions of non-Brownian
fibers with different length-to-diameter aspect ratios. We characterize the
number of fibers entrained on the surface of the substrate as a function of the
withdrawal velocity, allowing us to estimate a threshold capillary number below
which all the particles remain in the liquid bath. Besides, we measure the
angular distribution of the entrained fibers for two different substrate
geometries: flat plates and cylindrical rods. We then measure the film
thickness for more concentrated fiber suspensions. The entrainment of the
fibers on a flat plate and a cylindrical rod is primarily controlled by the
smaller characteristic length of the fibers: their diameter. At first order,
the entrainment threshold scales similarly to that of spherical particles. The
length of the fibers only appears to have a minor influence on the entrainment
threshold. No preferential alignment is observed for non-Brownian fibers on a
flat plate, except for very thin films, whereas the fibers tend to align
themselves along the axis of a cylindrical rod for a large enough ratio of the
fiber length to the radius of the cylindrical rod.

that incorporating dialogue history can help advance SLU performance. However,
separate models are used for each SLU task, leading to an increase in inference

that our joint model achieves similar results to task-specific classifiers and
can effectively integrate dialog context to further improve the SLU

avatar from a single image. However, recovering texture for the 3D human avatar
from a single image has been relatively less addressed. Because the generated
3D human avatar reveals the occluded texture of the given image as it moves, it
is critical to synthesize the occluded texture pattern that is unseen from the
source image. To generate a plausible texture map for 3D human avatars, the
occluded texture pattern needs to be synthesized with respect to the visible
texture from the given image. Moreover, the generated texture should align with
the surface of the target 3D mesh. In this paper, we propose a texture
synthesis method for a 3D human avatar that incorporates geometry information.
The proposed method consists of two convolutional networks for the sampling and
refining process. The sampler network fills in the occluded regions of the
source image and aligns the texture with the surface of the target 3D mesh
using the geometry information. The sampled texture is further refined and
adjusted by the refiner network. To maintain the clear details in the given

map. To effectively guide the sampler network to achieve its goal, we designed
a curriculum learning scheme that starts from a simple sampling task and
gradually progresses to the task where the alignment needs to be considered. We

in a large introductory design course. Our results confirm prior findings that
templates benefit students by providing a starting point, a shared process, and
the ability to access their own work from previous steps. While prior research

ordinal regression approach allowing the DM to provide preference information
in terms of ranking and pairwise comparing with regard to the intensity of
preference of some solutions of the optimization problem. Then, the score of
the reference solutions obtained through the deck of the cards method is used
as a basis for an ordinal regression procedure that, to take into account
interaction between criteria, represents DM's multicriteria preferences by
means of a value function expressed in terms of a Choquet Integral. The
obtained value function is then used to define a multiobjective optimization
problem. The new feasible solutions obtained by the resolution of the
optimization problem are proposed to the DM to verify his appreciation and
collect further new preference information to iterate the interaction procedure
ending when the DM is satisfied of the proposed solution. We apply our
methodology to a real world problem to handle the planning procedure of a

three parts for adaptive adjustments: facial region, non-facial foreground

StyleGAN and time coding for video learning, which enables high-quality video

variety of schemes for distributed quantum computing. This is challenged by
multiple nuisances, such as errors during the transmission over quantum links,
but also due to degradation of the entanglement over time due to decoherence.
The latter can be seen as a constraint on the latency of the quantum protocol,
which brings the problem of quantum protocol design into the context of
latency-reliability constraints. We address the problem through hybrid schemes
that combine: (1) indirect transmission based on teleportation and
purification; (2) direct transmission, based on quantum error correction (QEC).
The intuition is that, at present, the quantum hardware offers low fidelity,
which demands purification; on the other hand, low latency can be obtained by
QEC techniques. It is shown that, in the proposed framework, the purification
protocol gives rise to asymmetries that can be exploited by asymmetric quantum
error correcting code (QECC), which sets the basis for unique hybrid
purification and coding design. Our results show that ad-hoc asymmetric codes
give, compared to conventional QEC, a performance boost and codeword size
reduction both in a single link and in a quantum network scenario.

procedure. As a result, the existing 2D methods miss the rich 3D spatial
information when resolving the uncertainty. A popular approach for quantifying
the ambiguity in the data is to learn a distribution over the possible
hypotheses. In recent work, this ambiguity has been modeled to be strictly
Gaussian. Normalizing Flows (NFs) are capable of modelling more complex
distributions and thus, better fit the embedding space of the data. To this
end, we have developed a 3D probabilistic segmentation framework augmented with
NFs, to enable capturing the distributions of various complexity. To test the
proposed approach, we evaluate the model on the LIDC-IDRI dataset for lung
nodule segmentation and quantify the aleatoric uncertainty introduced by the
multi-annotator setting and inherent ambiguity in the CT data. Following this
approach, we are the first to present a 3D Squared Generalized Energy Distance

ignore the gravity of the disk, treating it as a reservoir of massless
planetesimals. In this paper, we continue our investigation into the long-term
interaction between a single eccentric planet and an external, massive debris
disk. Building upon our previous work, here we consider not only the
axisymmetric component of the disk's gravitational potential, but also the
non-axisymmetric torque that the disk exerts on the planet (ignoring for now
only the non-axisymmetric component of the disk \textit{self}-gravity). To this
goal, we develop and test a semi-analytic `$N$-ring' framework that is based on
a generalized (softened) version of the classical Laplace--Lagrange secular
theory. Using this tool, we demonstrate that even when the disk is less massive
than the planet, not only can a secular resonance be established within the
disk that leads to the formation of a wide non-axisymmetric gap (akin to those
observed in HD 107146, HD 92945, and HD 206893), but that the very same
resonance also damps the planetary eccentricity via a process known as resonant
friction. We also develop analytic understanding of these findings, finding
good quantitative agreement with the outcomes of the $N$-ring calculations. Our
results may be used to infer both the dynamical masses of gapped debris disks
and the dynamical history of the planets interior to them, as we exemplify for

coding (MLC) scheme that splits the observed symbols into bit layers and
utilizes binary Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes for reconciliation of the
symbols. While binary LDPC codes offer low latency for key generation,
splitting the symbols into bits results in a loss of key generation rate due to
error propagation. Additionally, existing LDPC codes do not fully utilize the
properties of the QKD channel to optimize the key rates. In this paper, we
mitigate the above issues by first generalizing the MLC scheme to a
non-binary(NB) MLC scheme that has layers with non-binary symbols and utilizes
NB-LDPC codes. We show the NB-MLC scheme offers flexibility in system design.
Additionally, we show that the NB-MLC scheme with a small symbol size per layer
offers the best trade-off between latency and key rate. We then propose a
framework to jointly optimize the rate and degree profile of the NB-LDPC codes

  Disinformation and Refutation Spreaders Using Machine Learning","9 pages, 7 figures, and 3 tables",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the ever-increasing spread of misinformation on online social networks,
it has become very important to identify the spreaders of misinformation
(unintentional), disinformation (intentional), and misinformation refutation.
It can help in educating the first, stopping the second, and soliciting the
help of the third category, respectively, in the overall effort to counter
misinformation spread. Existing research to identify spreaders is limited to
binary classification (true vs false information spreaders). However, people's
intention (whether naive or malicious) behind sharing misinformation can only
be understood after observing their behavior after exposure to both the
misinformation and its refutation which the existing literature lacks to
consider. In this paper, we propose a labeling mechanism to label people as one
of the five defined categories based on the behavioral actions they exhibit
when exposed to misinformation and its refutation. However, everyone does not
show behavioral actions but is part of a network. Therefore, we use their
network features, extracted through deep learning-based graph embedding models,
to train a machine learning model for the prediction of the classes. We name
our approach behavioral forensics since it is an evidence-based investigation
of suspicious behavior which is spreading misinformation and disinformation in
our case. After evaluating our proposed model on a real-world Twitter dataset,
we achieved 77.45% precision and 75.80% recall in detecting the malicious
actors, who shared the misinformation even after receiving its refutation. Such
behavior shows intention, and hence these actors can rightfully be called
agents of disinformation spread.

randomization, which breaks the dependencies between the perspectives. Hence,
existing techniques are not suited for advanced process mining tasks, e.g.,
social network mining or predictive monitoring. To address this gap, we propose
PMDG, a framework to ensure privacy for multi-perspective process mining
through data generalization. It provides group-based privacy guarantees for an
event log, while preserving the characteristic dependencies between the
control-flow and further process perspectives. Unlike existin privatization
techniques that rely on data suppression or noise insertion, PMDG adopts data
generalization: a technique where the activities and attribute values
referenced in events are generalized into more abstract ones, to obtain
equivalence classes that are sufficiently large from a privacy point of view.
We demonstrate empirically that PMDG outperforms state-of-the-art anonymization
techniques, when mining handovers and predicting outcomes.

like a survey questionnaire or an educational test. Differential item
functioning (DIF) analysis is typically conducted to assess measurement
invariance at the item level. Traditional DIF analysis methods require knowing
the comparison groups (reference and focal groups) and anchor items (a subset
of DIF-free items). Such prior knowledge may not always be available, and
psychometric methods have been proposed for DIF analysis when one piece of
information is unknown. More specifically, when the comparison groups are
unknown while anchor items are known, latent DIF analysis methods have been
proposed that estimate the unknown groups by latent classes. When anchor items
are unknown while comparison groups are known, methods have also been proposed,
typically under a sparsity assumption - the number of DIF items is not too
large. However, there does not exist a method for DIF analysis when both pieces
of information are unknown. This paper fills the gap. In the proposed method,
we model the unknown groups by latent classes and introduce item-specific DIF
parameters to capture the DIF effects. Assuming the number of DIF items is
relatively small, an $L_1$-regularised estimator is proposed to simultaneously
identify the latent classes and the DIF items. A computationally efficient
Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm is developed to solve the non-smooth
optimisation problem for the regularised estimator. The performance of the
proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and an application to item

also meet the requirements to steer soft growing vine robots through
challenging terrain. In this study, we compared the performance of three types
of pneumatic actuators in terms of their ability to perform eversion, bending,
dynamic motion, and force: the pouch motor, the cylindrical pneumatic
artificial muscle (cPAM), and the fabric pneumatic artificial muscle (fPAM).
The pouch motor is advantageous for prototyping due to its simple manufacturing
process. The cPAM exhibits superior bending behavior and produces the highest
forces, while the fPAM actuates fastest and everts at the lowest pressure. We
evaluated a similar range of dimensions for each actuator type. Larger
actuators can produce more significant deformations and forces, but smaller
actuators inflate more quickly and require a lower eversion pressure. Since
vine robots are lightweight, the effect of gravity on the functionality of
different actuators is minimal. We developed a new analytical model that
predicts the pressure-to-bending behavior of vine robot actuators. Using the
actuator results, we designed and demonstrated a 4.8 m long vine robot equipped
with highly maneuverable 60x60 mm cPAMs in a three-dimensional obstacle course.
The vine robot was able to move around sharp turns, travel through a passage
smaller than its diameter, and lift itself against gravity.

process is costly, or even impossible, for many domains. In this study, we
develop an infinite agent that learns to transfer knowledge memory from general
foundation models (e.g. GPT4, DALLE) to novel domains or scenarios for scene

approach is an emerging mechanism, dubbed Augmented Reality with Knowledge
Inference Interaction (ArK), which leverages knowledge-memory to generate

interactive emergent ability (Figure 1) is demonstrated as the observation
learns i) micro-action of cross-modality: in multi-modality models to collect a
large amount of relevant knowledge memory data for each interaction task (e.g.,
unseen scene understanding) from the physical reality; and ii) macro-behavior
of reality-agnostic: in mix-reality environments to improve interactions that
tailor to different characterized roles, target variables, collaborative

clusters as part of the unfolded protein response (UPR). We use kinetic Monte
Carlo simulations to explore IRE1 clustering dynamics on the surface of ER
tubes. While initially growing clusters are approximately round, once a cluster
is sufficiently large a shorter interface length can be achieved by `wrapping'
around the ER tube. A wrapped cluster can grow without further interface length
increases. Relative to wide tubes, narrower tubes enable cluster wrapping at
smaller cluster sizes. Our simulations show that wrapped clusters on narrower
tubes grow more rapidly, evaporate more slowly, and require a lower protein
concentration to grow compared to equal-area round clusters on wider tubes.
These results suggest that cluster wrapping, facilitated by narrower tubes,
could be an important factor in the growth and stability of IRE1 clusters and
thus impact the persistence of the UPR, connecting geometry to signaling
behavior. This work is consistent with recent experimental observations of IRE1
clusters wrapped around narrow tubes in the ER network.

The algorithm is based on a genetic algorithm, which mutates randomly generated

performance of the neural network on a batch of real world data is considered a
surrogate for the fitness of the generated dataset used for its training. As
selection pressure is applied to the population of generated datasets, unfit
individuals are discarded, and the fitness of the fittest individuals increases
through generations. The performance of the data generation algorithm was
measured on the Iris dataset and on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic
dataset. In conditions of real world data abundance, mean accuracy of machine
learning models trained on generated data was comparable to mean accuracy of
models trained on real world data (0.956 in both cases on the Iris dataset, p =
0.6996, and 0.9377 versus 0.9472 on the Breast Cancer dataset, p = 0.1189). In
conditions of simulated extreme scarcity of real world data, mean accuracy of

mean accuracy of comparable models trained on scarce real world data (0.9533

signals caused by rotationally-modulated starspots can obscure or mimic the
Doppler shifts induced by even the closest, most massive planets. This is
especially true for young, magnetically active stars where stellar activity can
cause fluctuation amplitudes of $\gtrsim$0.1 mag in brightness and $\gtrsim$100
m s$^{-1}$ in RV semi-amplitudes. Techniques that can mitigate these effects
and increase our sensitivity to young planets are critical to improving our
understanding of the evolution of planetary systems. Gaussian processes (GPs)
have been successfully employed to model and constrain activity signals in
individual cases. However, a principled approach of this technique,
specifically for the joint modeling of photometry and RVs, has not yet been

their time derivatives. We also simulate time series affected by starspots by
extending the $\texttt{starry}$ software (Luger et al. 2019) to incorporate
time evolution of stellar features. Using these synthetic datasets, we show
that our method can predict spot-driven RV variations with greater accuracy
than other GP approaches.

semimetal. Disorder leads to significant renormalisations of the quasiparticle
properties due to ultraviolet processes, i.e. processes of scattering in a
large band of momenta, of the width exceeding the inverse mean free path. As a
result, observables such as the density of states and conductivity exhibit
singular behaviour in a broad range of disorder strengths, excluding a small
vicinity of the singular point. We find that, for example, the density of
quasiparticle states diverges as a function of the disorder strength $g$ as
$\rho(g,E)\propto |g_c(E)-g|^{-2}|E|$ for $g$ smaller than the critical value
$g_c(E)$ and crosses over to a constant for $g$ very close to $g_c(E)$, where
$E$ is the quasiparticle energy. For certain disorder symmetries, a 3D
disordered nodal-line semimetal can be mapped to a 2D metal with attractive
interactions. The described disorder-driven instabilities in such a nodal-line
semimetal are mapped to Cooper and exciton-condensation instabilities in a 2D
metal. For other disorder symmetries, the respective instabilities are similar
but not exactly dual. We discuss experimental conditions favourable for the
observation of the described effects.

larger black hole (BH) masses ($\log\,M_\text{BH}>7.5$) with similar or even
lower Eddington ratios. Our extended XMM-Newton sample of NLS1s shows strong
soft X-ray excess emission below 2 keV. The quantified soft excess strength
does not show an obvious discrepancy from previous studies of the
lower-redshift NLS1s. The systematic effect in the measurement of the Eddington
ratio mainly lies in the bolometric correction factor. We also tentatively fit
the spectra assuming two more physical models for the soft excess: warm
Comptonization and relativistic reflection from the inner accretion disk. In
the first scenario, we confirm the ubiquity of a warm and optically thick
corona. The behavior of a single source can be better explained by relativistic
reflection, although we cannot distinguish which model is a more favorable
explanation for the soft excess based on the best-fit statistics.

improve our understanding of the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) and the role of
feedback processes on galaxy formation, allowing us to calibrate important
astrophysical systematics in cosmological constraints from weak lensing galaxy
clustering surveys. However, the signal is only measured in a two-dimensional
projection, and its correct interpretation relies on understanding the
connection between observable quantities and the underlying intrinsic
properties of the gas, in addition to the relation between the gas and the
underlying matter distribution. One way to address these challenges is through
the use of hydrodynamical simulations such as the high-resolution, large-volume
MillenniumTNG suite. We find that measurements of the optical depth, $\tau$,
and the Compton-y parameter, $Y$, receive large line-of-sight contributions
which can be removed effectively by applying a Compensated Aperture Photometry
(CAP) filter. In contrast with other $\tau$ probes (e.g., X-rays and Fast Radio
Bursts), the kSZ-inferred $\tau$ receives most of its signal from a confined
cylindrical region around the halo due to the velocity decorrelation along the
line-of-sight. Additionally, we perform fits to the $Y-M$ and $\tau-M$ scaling
relations and report best-fit parameters adopting the smoothly broken power law
(SBPL) formalism. We note that subgrid physics modeling can broaden the error
bar on these by 30\% for intermediate-mass halos ($\sim$$10^{13} \, {\rm
M}_{\odot}$). The scatter of the scaling relations can be captured by an
intrinsic dependence on concentration, and an extrinsic dependence on tidal
shear. Finally, we comment on the effect of using galaxies rather than halos in
real observations, which can bias the inferred SZ profiles by $\sim$20\% for
$L_\ast$-galaxies.

Comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dark matter subhaloes are key for the predictions of simulations of structure
formation, but their existence frequently ends prematurely due to two technical
issues, namely numerical disruption in N-body simulations and halo finders
failing to identify them. Here we focus on the second issue, using the
phase-space friends-of-friends halo finder ROCKSTAR as a benchmark (though we
expect our results to translate to comparable codes). We confirm that the most
prominent cause for losing track of subhaloes is tidal distortion rather than a
low number of particles. As a solution, we present a flexible post-processing
algorithm that tracks all subhalo particles over time, computes subhalo
positions and masses based on those particles, and progressively removes
stripped matter. If a subhalo is lost by the halo finder, this algorithm keeps
tracking its so-called ghost until it has almost no particles left or has truly
merged with its host. We apply this technique to a large suite of N-body
simulations and restore lost subhaloes to the halo catalogues, which has a
dramatic effect on key summary statistics of large-scale structure.
Specifically, the subhalo mass function increases by about 50% and the halo
correlation function increases by a factor of two at small scales. While these
quantitative results are somewhat specific to our algorithm, they demonstrate
that particle tracking is a promising way to reliably follow haloes and reduce
the need for orphan models. Our algorithm and augmented halo catalogues are
publicly available.

the quasar redshift, luminosity, or black hole mass, indicates a large
diversity of quasar lifetimes. Two of our proximity zone sizes are
exceptionally small. The spectrum of one of these quasars, with $z=6.02$,

0.31+-0.07 dex, indicating a factor of two systematic uncertainty in RM black

heterogeneous samples. While we are unable to robustly constrain the slope of
the R-L relation for CIV given the limited dynamical range in luminosity, we
found substantially larger scatter in CIV lags at fixed L1350. Using the

well as between the SE recipes from two different lines, over the luminosity

based on the augmented Lagrangian framework for optimization problems with a
stochastic objective function and deterministic constraints. Our main
contribution is combining the augmented Lagrangian framework with adaptive
sampling, resulting in an efficient optimization methodology validated with
practical examples. To achieve the presented efficiency, we consider inexact
solutions for the augmented Lagrangian subproblems, and through an adaptive
sampling mechanism, we control the variance in the gradient estimates.
Furthermore, we analyze the theoretical performance of the proposed scheme by
showing equivalence to a gradient descent algorithm on a Moreau envelope
function, and we prove sublinear convergence for convex objectives and linear
convergence for strongly convex objectives with affine equality constraints.
The worst-case sample complexity of the resulting algorithm, for an arbitrary
choice of penalty parameter in the augmented Lagrangian function, is
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3-\delta})$, where $\epsilon > 0$ is the expected error
of the solution and $\delta > 0$ is a user-defined parameter. If the penalty
parameter is chosen to be $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, we demonstrate that the
result can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$, which is competitive
with the other methods employed in the literature. Moreover, if the objective
function is strongly convex with affine equality constraints, we obtain
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1}\log(1/\epsilon))$ complexity. Finally, we
empirically verify the performance of our adaptive sampling augmented
Lagrangian framework in machine learning optimization and engineering design
problems, including topology optimization of a heat sink with environmental
uncertainty.

context of (1+1)-dimensional conformal field theories ($1+1$ d CFTs). In the
spatial region where the modulated energy density is small, these deformations
prevent the spreading of quantum information while in the region where the
modulated energy density is large quantum information scrambling is
accelerated. This suggests that we can control the scrambling and butterfly

excess holes in the conduction and valence bands, as well as carriers trapped

important in a variety of business applications, including sentiment analysis,
text classification, and named entity recognition. In this paper, we propose an
approach for company classification using NLP and zero-shot learning. Our
method utilizes pre-trained transformer models to extract features from company
descriptions, and then applies zero-shot learning to classify companies into
relevant categories without the need for specific training data for each
category. We evaluate our approach on publicly available datasets of textual
descriptions of companies, and demonstrate that it can streamline the process
of company classification, thereby reducing the time and resources required in
traditional approaches such as the Global Industry Classification Standard
(GICS). The results show that this method has potential for automation of
company classification, making it a promising avenue for future research in
this area.

phenomenon. Relative permeability is one of the primary determinants in
reservoir performance calculations. Accurate estimation of the relative
permeability is crucial for reservoir management and future production. In this
paper, we propose inferring relative permeability curves from sparse saturation
data with an ensemble Kalman method. We represent these curves through a series
of positive increments of relative permeability at specified saturation values,
which guarantees monotonicity within, and boundedness between, 0 and 1. The
proposed method is validated by the inference performances in two synthetic
benchmarks designed by SPE and a field-scale model developed by Equinor that
includes certain real-field features. The results indicate that the relative
permeability curves can be accurately estimated within the saturation intervals
having available observations and appropriately extrapolated to the remaining
saturations by virtue of the embedded constraints. The predicted well responses
are comparable to the ground truths, even though they are not included as the
observation. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using ensemble Kalman
method to infer relative permeability curves from saturation data, which can
aid in the predictions of multiphase flow and reservoir production.

  northward shifted relic field","Accepted to be published in Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Solar and heliospheric parameters can depict notable differences between the
northern and southern hemisphere. Although hemispheric asymmetries of some
heliospheric parameters vary systematically with Hale cycle, this is not common
for solar parameters. Also, no physical mechanism exists which can explain
systematic hemispheric asymmetries. We use a novel method of high
heliolatitudes to increase the fraction of one hemisphere in solar 10.7cm radio
fluxes and sunspot numbers. We calculate sets of hemispheric high-latitude
radio fluxes and sunspot numbers with increasing heliographic latitude during
the last 75 years. We also normalise these fluxes by yearly means in order to
study their continuous variation. We find that cycle maximum radio fluxes and
sunspot numbers in each odd cycle (19, 21, 23) are larger at northern high
latitudes, while in all even cycles (18, 20, 22 24) they are larger at southern
latitudes. This alternation indicates a new form of Hale cycle variation in
solar activity. Hemispheric differences at cycle maxima are 15% for radio flux
and 23% for sunspot numbers. The difference is largest during cycle 19 and
smallest in cycle 24. Continuous fluxes depict a Hale cycle in both
hemispheres, with an opposite phase and amplitude of 5% in north and 4% in
south. Hemispheric Hale cycle can be explained if there is a northward directed
relic magnetic field, which is shifted northward. In odd cycles, the northern
hemisphere is enhanced more than the southern hemisphere and, in even cycles,
the northern hemisphere is reduced more than the southern hemisphere. The
decrease of asymmetry during the 7 cycles can be explained if the relic shift
oscillates at the 210-year Suess/deVries period. Gleissberg cycle consists of
one off-equator excursion of the relic. Relic field in the Sun also offers a
possibility for century-scale forecasting of solar activity.

applying a critical point result coming out from a classical Pucci-Serrin

can perform, and sufficiently difficult tasks are critical drivers of strong
machine learning models. However, quantifying the generalization difficulty of
machine learning benchmarks has remained challenging. We propose what is to our
knowledge the first model-agnostic measure of the inherent generalization
difficulty of tasks. Our inductive bias complexity measure quantifies the total
information required to generalize well on a task minus the information
provided by the data. It does so by measuring the fractional volume occupied by
hypotheses that generalize on a task given that they fit the training data. It
scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimensionality of the space over which
the model must generalize but only polynomially in resolution per dimension,
showing that tasks which require generalizing over many dimensions are
drastically more difficult than tasks involving more detail in fewer
dimensions. Our measure can be applied to compute and compare supervised
learning, reinforcement learning and meta-learning generalization difficulties
against each other. We show that applied empirically, it formally quantifies
intuitively expected trends, e.g. that in terms of required inductive bias,
MNIST < CIFAR10 < Imagenet and fully observable Markov decision processes
(MDPs) < partially observable MDPs. Further, we show that classification of
complex images < few-shot meta-learning with simple images. Our measure
provides a quantitative metric to guide the construction of more complex tasks
requiring greater inductive bias, and thereby encourages the development of
more sophisticated architectures and learning algorithms with more powerful
generalization capabilities.

usefulness of collecting system data, it may significantly impact the system
execution by delaying response times and competing with system resources. The
typical approach to cope with this is to filter portions of the system to be

achieving a desired trade-off between the amount of collected information and
the impact on the system performance, they focus on collecting data of a

to dynamically adapt the sampling rate while monitoring software systems. It

hypersurface, parametrized by a homogeneous function of degree $d\in
\mathbb{R}_{>1}$, with non-vanishing curvature away from the origin. Consider
the number $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ of rationals $\mathbf{a}/q$,
with denominator $q\in [Q,2Q)$ and $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n-1}$, lying at
a distance at most $\delta/q$ from $\mathscr{M}$. This manuscript provides
essentially sharp estimates for $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ throughout
the range $\delta \in (Q^{\varepsilon-1},1/2)$. Our result is a first of its
kind for hypersurfaces with vanishing Gaussian curvature ($d>2$) and those
which are rough (meaning not even $C^2$ at the origin which happens when
$d<2$). An interesting outcome of our investigation is the understanding of a
`geometric' term $(\delta/Q)^{(n-1)/d}Q^n$ (stemming from a so-called Knapp
cap), arising in addition to the usual probabilistic term $\delta Q^n$; the sum
of these terms determines the size of $\mathrm{N}_{\mathscr{M}}(\delta,Q)$ for
$\delta\in(Q^{\varepsilon-1},1/2)$.
  Several tools from harmonic analysis are used to establish the upper bounds.
A central role is played by a dyadic scaling argument exploiting the
homogeneous nature of $\mathscr{M}$. Further, we build upon a powerful
bootstrapping argument of J.-J. Huang, which in our case is even more delicate
due the additional geometric term. We also carry out this argument for each
dyadic scale separately, keeping track of estimates for two different classes
of hypersurfaces at each step: the `flat' $\mathscr{M}$ and its `rough'
(Legendre) dual $\tilde{\mathscr{M}}$. The lower bounds, demonstrating the
sharpness of the result in several cases, follow from a combination of harmonic
analysis techniques and the geometry of numbers.

chromatin dynamics, which accounts for the coherent motions that have been
observed in experiment. The coherent motion is due to the long-range
cooperation of molecular motors tethered to chromatin. Cooperation occurs if
each motor acts simultaneously on the polymer and the surrounding solvent,
exerting on them equal and opposite forces. This drives the flow of solvent
past the polymer, which in turn affects the orientation of nearby motors and,
if the drive is strong enough, an active polar (``ferromagnetic'') phase of
motors can spontaneously form. Depending on boundary conditions, either
transverse flows, or sustained longitudinal oscillations and waves are
possible. Predicted time and length scales are consistent with experiments. We
now have in hand a coarse-grained description of chromatin dynamics which
reproduces the directed coherent flows of chromatin seen in experiments. This
field-theoretic description can be analytically coupled to other features of
the nuclear environment such as fluctuating or porous boundaries, local
heterogeneities in the distribution of chromatin or its activity, leading to
insights on the effects of activity on the cell nucleus and its contents.

ultimately demands reactive decision making for meaningfully optimizing

Standard ergodic-optimal policies are however susceptible to the statistical
variability of fading, often leading to systems which are severely unreliable
and spectrally wasteful. On the flip side, minimax/outage-optimal policies are
too pessimistic and often hard to determine. We propose a new risk-aware
formulation of the resource allocation problem for standard multi-user
point-to-point power-constrained communication with no cross-interference, by
employing the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CV@R) as a measure of fading risk. A
remarkable feature of this approach is that it is a convex generalization of
the ergodic setting while inducing robustness and reliability in a fully
tunable way, thus bridging the gap between the (naive) ergodic and
(conservative) minimax approaches. We provide a closed-form expression for the
CV@R-optimal policy given primal/dual variables, extending the classical
stochastic waterfilling policy. We then develop a primal-dual tail-waterfilling
scheme to recursively learn a globally optimal risk-aware policy. The
effectiveness of the approach is verified via detailed simulations.

showed promise for short, one-day search durations, but proved ineffective for
longer durations of around ten days. In this paper, we offer a hypothesis for
this limitation and propose new design principles to overcome it. As a proof of
concept, we show that our novel convolutional DNN architecture attains
matched-filtering sensitivity for a targeted search (i.e., single sky-position
and frequency) in Gaussian data from two detectors spanning ten days. We
illustrate this performance for two different sky positions and five
frequencies in the $20 - 1000 \mathrm{Hz}$ range, spanning the spectrum from an
``easy'' to the ``hardest'' case. The corresponding sensitivity depths fall in
the range of $82 - 86 / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$. The same DNN architecture is
trained for each case, taking between $4 - 32$ hours to reach matched-filtering
sensitivity. The detection probability of the trained DNNs as a function of
signal amplitude varies consistently with that of matched filtering.
Furthermore, the DNN statistic distributions can be approximately mapped to
those of the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic under a simple monotonic function.

FedGMM possesses an additional advantage of adapting to new clients with

with a positive integer $k$ and the goal is to find a partition of the ground
set $V$ into $k$ non-empty parts $V_1, V_2, ..., V_k$ in order to minimize
$\sum_{i=1}^k f(V_i)$. Narayanan, Roy, and Patkar (Journal of Algorithms, 1996)
designed an algorithm for submodular $k$-partition based on the principal
partition sequence and showed that the approximation factor of their algorithm
is $2$ for the special case of graph cut functions (subsequently rediscovered
by Ravi and Sinha (Journal of Operational Research, 2008)). In this work, we
study the approximation factor of their algorithm for three subfamilies of
submodular functions -- monotone, symmetric, and posimodular, and show the
following results:
  1. The approximation factor of their algorithm for monotone submodular
$k$-partition is $4/3$. This result improves on the $2$-factor achievable via
other algorithms. Moreover, our upper bound of $4/3$ matches the recently shown
lower bound under polynomial number of function evaluation queries (Santiago,
IWOCA 2021). Our upper bound of $4/3$ is also the first improvement beyond $2$
for a certain graph partitioning problem that is a special case of monotone
submodular $k$-partition.
  2. The approximation factor of their algorithm for symmetric submodular
$k$-partition is $2$. This result generalizes their approximation factor
analysis beyond graph cut functions.
  3. The approximation factor of their algorithm for posimodular submodular
$k$-partition is $2$.
  We also construct an example to show that the approximation factor of their
algorithm for arbitrary submodular functions is $\Omega(n/k)$.

  Approximation",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the robust communication complexity of maximum matching. Edges of an
arbitrary $n$-vertex graph $G$ are randomly partitioned between Alice and Bob
independently and uniformly. Alice has to send a single message to Bob such
that Bob can find an (approximate) maximum matching of the whole graph $G$. We
specifically study the best approximation ratio achievable via protocols where
Alice communicates only $\widetilde{O}(n)$ bits to Bob.
  There has been a growing interest on the robust communication model due to
its connections to the random-order streaming model. An algorithm of Assadi and
Behnezhad [ICALP'21] implies a $(2/3+\epsilon_0 \sim .667)$-approximation for a
small constant $0 < \epsilon_0 < 10^{-18}$, which remains the best-known
approximation for general graphs. For bipartite graphs, Assadi and Behnezhad
[Random'21] improved the approximation to .716 albeit with a computationally
inefficient (i.e., exponential time) protocol.
  In this paper, we study a natural and efficient protocol implied by a
random-order streaming algorithm of Bernstein [ICALP'20] which is based on
edge-degree constrained subgraphs (EDCS) [Bernstein and Stein; ICALP'15]. The
result of Bernstein immediately implies that this protocol achieves an (almost)
$(2/3 \sim .666)$-approximation in the robust communication model. We present a
new analysis, proving that it achieves a much better (almost) $(5/6 \sim
.833)$-approximation. This significantly improves previous approximations both
for general and bipartite graphs. We also prove that our analysis of
Bernstein's protocol is tight.

fluid. When many cilia are located on a surface, their beating can synchronise
such that their phases form metachronal waves. Here, we computationally study a
model where each cilium is represented as a spherical particle, moving along a
tilted trajectory with a position-dependent active driving force and a
position-dependent internal drag coefficient. The model thus takes into account
all the essential broken symmetries of the ciliary beat. We show that taking
into account the near-field hydrodynamic interactions, the effective coupling
between cilia can become nonreciprocal: the phase of a cilium is more strongly
affected by an adjacent cilium on one side than by a cilium at the same
distance in the opposite direction. As a result, synchronisation starts from a
seed at the edge of a group of cilia and propagates rapidly across the system,
leading to a synchronisation time that scales proportionally to the linear
dimension of the system. We show that a ciliary carpet is characterised by
three different velocities: the velocity of fluid transport, the phase velocity
of metachronal waves and the group velocity of order propagation. Unlike in
systems with reciprocal coupling, boundary effects are not detrimental for
synchronisation, but rather enable the formation of the initial seed.

quantum state through measurements. It is a key primitive for developing
quantum technologies. Neural network quantum state tomography (NNQST), which

implemented via a basis-dependent cross-entropy loss function. State-of-the-art
implementations of NNQST are often restricted to characterizing a particular
subclass of states, to avoid an exponential growth in the number of required
measurement settings. To provide a more broadly applicable method for efficient

(NSQST)-an alternative neural network-based QST protocol that uses infidelity
as the loss function. The infidelity is estimated using the classical shadows
of the target state. Infidelity is a natural choice for training loss,
benefiting from the proven measurement sample efficiency of the classical
shadow formalism. Furthermore, NSQST is robust against various types of noise
without any error mitigation. We numerically demonstrate the advantage of NSQST
over NNQST at learning the relative phases of three target quantum states of
practical interest. NSQST greatly extends the practical reach of NNQST and
provides a novel route to effective quantum state tomography.

1977 as a measure of node importance in graphs. This measure has found use in
various applications and has been extended to temporal graphs with time-labeled
edges. Recent research by Bu{\ss} et al. \cite{buss2020algorithmic} and Rymar
et al. \cite{rymar2021towards} has shown that it is possible to compute the
shortest path betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph in
$O(n^3\,T^2)$ and $O(n^2\,m\,T^2)$ time, respectively, where $T$ is the maximum
time, $m$ is the number of temporal edges, and $n$ is the number of nodes.
These approaches considered paths that do not take into account contributions
from intermediate temporal nodes.
  In this paper, we study the classical temporal betweenness centrality paths
that we call \textit{passive} shortest paths, as well as an alternative variant
that we call \textit{active} shortest paths, which takes into account
contributions from all temporal nodes. We present an improved analysis of the
running time of the classical algorithm for computing betweenness centrality of
all nodes, reducing the time complexity to $O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T)$. Furthermore,
for active paths, we show that the betweenness centrality can be computed in
$O(n\,m\,T+ n^2\,T^2)$. We also show that our results hold for different
shortest paths variants.
  Finally, we provide an open-source implementation of our algorithms and
conduct experiments on several real-world datasets. We compare the results of
the two variants on both the node and time dimensions of the temporal graph,
and we also compare the temporal betweenness centrality to its static
counterpart. Our experiments suggest that for the shortest foremost variant
looking only at the first $10\%$ of the temporal interaction is a very good
approximation for the overall top ranked nodes.

block chain technologies hold great promise in this regard, with potential
benefits such as personalized learning, secure credentialing, and decentralized
learning networks. This paper presents a review of existing research on AI and
block chain in education, analyzing case studies and exploring the potential
benefits and challenges of these technologies. The paper also suggests a unique
model for integrating AI and block chain into sustainable teaching and learning
practices. Future research directions are discussed, including the need for
more empirical studies and the exploration of ethical and social implications.
The key summary of this discussion is that, by enhancing accessibility,
efficacy, and security in education, AI and blockchain have the potential to
revolutionise the field. In order to ensure that students can benefit from
these potentially game-changing technologies as technology develops, it will be
crucial to find ways to harness its power while minimising hazards. Overall,
this paper highlights the potential of AI and block chain as sustainable tools
for teaching and learning in the 4IR era and their respective advantages,
issues and future prospects have been discussed in this writing.

high-dimensional, their long-time dynamics often live on a lower-dimensional
manifold. The present work introduces an autoencoder framework that combines
implicit regularization with internal linear layers and $L_2$ regularization
(weight decay) to automatically estimate the underlying dimensionality of a
data set, produce an orthogonal manifold coordinate system, and provide the
mapping functions between the ambient space and manifold space, allowing for
out-of-sample projections. We validate our framework's ability to estimate the
manifold dimension for a series of datasets from dynamical systems of varying
complexities and compare to other state-of-the-art estimators. We analyze the
training dynamics of the network to glean insight into the mechanism of
low-rank learning and find that collectively each of the implicit regularizing
layers compound the low-rank representation and even self-correct during
training. Analysis of gradient descent dynamics for this architecture in the
linear case reveals the role of the internal linear layers in leading to faster
decay of a ""collective weight variable"" incorporating all layers, and the role
of weight decay in breaking degeneracies and thus driving convergence along
directions in which no decay would occur in its absence. We show that this
framework can be naturally extended for applications of state-space modeling
and forecasting by generating a data-driven dynamic model of a spatiotemporally
chaotic partial differential equation using only the manifold coordinates.
Finally, we demonstrate that our framework is robust to hyperparameter choices.

practice: that the performative risk is convex over the deployed model, and
that the mapping from the model to the data distribution is known to the model

tackle this more challenging setting, we develop a two-level zeroth-order

function of the induced data distribution. Under mild conditions, this
reparameterization allows us to transform the non-convex objective into a
convex one and achieve provable regret guarantees. In particular, we provide a
regret bound that is sublinear in the total number of performative samples

experience (indoor or outdoor), and requires the simulator to model no
predominantly-outdoor phenomenon (sloped grounds, sidewalks, etc). The key to
I2O transfer is in providing the robot with additional context of the
environment (i.e., a satellite map, a rough sketch of a map by a human, etc.)
to guide the robot's navigation in the real-world. The provided context-maps do
not need to be accurate or complete -- real-world obstacles (e.g., trees,
bushes, pedestrians, etc.) are not drawn on the map, and openings are not
aligned with where they are in the real-world. Crucially, these inaccurate
context-maps provide a hint to the robot about a route to take to the goal. We
find that our method that leverages Context-Maps is able to successfully
navigate hundreds of meters in novel environments, avoiding novel obstacles on
its path, to a distant goal without a single collision or human intervention.
In comparison, policies without the additional context fail completely. Lastly,
we test the robustness of the Context-Map policy by adding varying degrees of
noise to the map in simulation. We find that the Context-Map policy is
surprisingly robust to noise in the provided context-map. In the presence of
significantly inaccurate maps (corrupted with 50% noise, or entirely blank
maps), the policy gracefully regresses to the behavior of a policy with no
context. Videos are available at https://www.joannetruong.com/projects/i2o.html

implement several covariate-adjusted causal estimators. We thoroughly evaluate
their performance at scale, highlighting benefits and shortcomings of different

considered in two separate theoretical models. Solutions to the linearized
quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity equations are first used to show that the
vertical length scale of a tropopause geopotential anomaly is initially
shallow, but significantly increased by diabatic heating from radiative
relaxation. This process is deemed as geostrophic adjustment of the
stratosphere to tropospheric forcing. Idealized, time-dependent calculations
show that tropopause geopotential anomalies can appreciably rise in the
stratosphere on time scales of a couple months. A previously developed, coupled
troposphere-stratosphere model is introduced and modified to further understand
how tropospheric geopotential forcing can induce upwelling in the stratosphere.
Solutions to steady, zonally-symmetric sea-surface-temperature forcings in the
linear $\beta$-plane model show that the upwards stratospheric penetration of
the thermally induced tropopause geopotential anomaly is controlled by a
non-dimensional parameter that depends on the ratio between the time scale of
wave-drag to that of radiation. It is also shown that the horizontal scale of
the tropopause geopotential anomaly modulates the vertical scale of the
anomaly. When Earth-like non-dimensional parameters are used, the theoretical
model predicts stratospheric temperature anomalies around two times larger in
magnitude than those in the boundary layer, approximately in line with
observational data. The results are argued to show that wave-drag alone may not
suffice to explain certain observed features of the lower stratosphere,
foremost of which is the anti-correlation between sea-surface temperature and
lower stratospheric temperature.

provide an intuitive framework for building new quantum algorithms. The
lackadaisical quantum walk, which is a quantum analog of the lazy random walk,
is obtained by adding a self-loop transition to each state allowing the walker
to stay stuck in the same state, being able to improve the performance of the
quantum walks as search algorithms. However, the high dependence of a weight
$l$ makes it a key parameter to reach the maximum probability of success in the
search process. Although many advances have been achieved with search
algorithms based on quantum walks, the number of self-loops can also be
critical for search tasks. Believing that the multiple self-loops have not yet
been properly explored, this article proposes the quantum search algorithm
Multiself-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion, which
is based on a lackadaisical quantum walk with multiple self-loops where the
target state phase is partially inverted. Each vertex has $m$ self-loops, with
weights $l' = l/m$, where $l$ is a real parameter. The phase inversion is based
on Grover's algorithm and acts partiality, modifying the phase of a given
quantity $s \leqslant m$ of self-loops. On a hypercube structure, we analyzed
the situation where $s=1$ and $1 \leqslant m \leqslant 30$ and investigated its
effects in the search for 1 to 12 marked vertices. Based on two ideal weights
$l$ used in the literature, we propose two new weight values. As a result, with
the proposal of the Multiself-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with partial
phase inversion of target states and the new weight values for the self-loop,
this proposal improved the maximum success probabilities to values close to 1.

Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which
needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to
achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable
Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep
learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and
optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the

analysis was validated on ZTF alert packets linked to confirmed solar system
objects from the Minor Planet Center database. Finally, the results were
confronted against follow-up observations. Between November 2019 and December

machine goals are misaligned with those of people. Since humans continually
adapt to their environment using a combination of explicit and implicit
strategies, when the environment contains an adaptive machine, the human and
machine play a game. Game theory is an established framework for modeling
interactions between two or more decision-makers that has been applied
extensively in economic markets and machine algorithms. However, existing
approaches make assumptions about, rather than empirically test, how adaptation
by individual humans is affected by interaction with an adaptive machine. Here
we tested learning algorithms for machines playing general-sum games with human
subjects. Our algorithms enable the machine to select the outcome of the
co-adaptive interaction from a constellation of game-theoretic equilibria in
action and policy spaces. Importantly, the machine learning algorithms work
directly from observations of human actions without solving an inverse problem
to estimate the human's utility function as in prior work. Surprisingly, one
algorithm can steer the human-machine interaction to the machine's optimum,
effectively controlling the human's actions even while the human responds
optimally to their perceived cost landscape. Our results show that game theory

datasets have not been analyzed with different TGN models to establish the
state-of-the-art. Therefore, this project aims to address this gap in the
literature by performing a qualitative analysis of spatial-temporal dependence
structure learning on dynamic graphs, as well as a comparative study of the
effectiveness of selected TGNs on node and edge prediction tasks. Additionally,
an extensive ablation study will be conducted on different variants of the
best-performing TGN to identify the key factors contributing to its
performance. By achieving these objectives, this project will provide valuable
insights into the design and optimization of TGNs for dynamic graph analysis,
with potential applications in areas such as disease spread prediction, social
network analysis, traffic prediction, and more. Moreover, an attempt is made to
convert snapshot-based data to the event-based dataset and make it compatible
with the SOTA model namely TGN to perform node regression task.

problem depends on the gate count and depth in near-term noisy quantum
computers. Quantum circuit compilers that decompose high-level gates to native
gates of the hardware and optimize the circuit play a key role in quantum
computing. However, the quality and time complexity of the optimization process
can vary significantly especially for practically relevant large-scale quantum
circuits. As a result, third-party (often less-trusted/untrusted) compilers
have emerged, claiming to provide better and faster optimization of complex
quantum circuits than so-called trusted compilers. However, untrusted compilers
can pose severe security risks, such as the theft of sensitive intellectual
property (IP) embedded within the quantum circuit. We propose an obfuscation
technique for quantum circuits using randomized reversible gates to protect
them from such attacks during compilation. The idea is to insert a small random
circuit into the original circuit and send it to the untrusted compiler. Since
the circuit function is corrupted, the adversary may get incorrect IP. However,
the user may also get incorrect output post-compilation. To circumvent this
issue, we concatenate the inverse of the random circuit in the compiled circuit
to recover the original functionality. We demonstrate the practicality of our
method by conducting exhaustive experiments on a set of benchmark circuits and
measuring the quality of obfuscation by calculating the Total Variation
Distance (TVD) metric. Our method achieves TVD of up to 1.92 and performs at
least 2X better than a previously reported obfuscation method. We also propose
a novel adversarial reverse engineering (RE) approach and show that the
proposed obfuscation is resilient against RE attacks. The proposed technique
introduces minimal degradation in fidelity (~1% to ~3% on average).

algorithms without strong assumptions such as Lipschitz or convexity
conditions. However, the current generalization error bounds within this

binary neutron star mergers, neutrinos play a major role in driving various
dynamical and microphysical phenomena, such as baryonic matter outflows, the
synthesis of heavy elements, and the supernova explosion mechanism itself. The
interactions of neutrinos with matter in these environments are
flavor-specific, which makes it of paramount importance to understand the
flavor evolution of neutrinos. Flavor evolution in these environments can be a
highly nontrivial problem thanks to a multitude of collective effects in flavor
space, arising due to neutrino-neutrino ($\nu$-$\nu$) interactions in regions
with high neutrino densities. A neutrino ensemble undergoing flavor
oscillations under the influence of significant $\nu$-$\nu$ interactions is
somewhat analogous to a system of coupled spins with long-range interactions
among themselves and with an external field ('long-range' in momentum-space in
the case of neutrinos). As a result, it becomes pertinent to consider whether
these interactions can give rise to significant quantum correlations among the
interacting neutrinos, and whether these correlations have any consequences for
the flavor evolution of the ensemble. In particular, one may seek to utilize
concepts and tools from quantum information science and quantum computing to
deepen our understanding of these phenomena. In this article, we attempt to
summarize recent work in this field. Furthermore, we also present some new

requires high levels of awareness from ATCos and can be tedious and
error-prone. Recent attempts have been made to integrate artificial
intelligence (AI) into ATC in order to reduce the workload of ATCos. However,
the development of data-driven AI systems for ATC demands large-scale annotated
datasets, which are currently lacking in the field. This paper explores the
lessons learned from the ATCO2 project, a project that aimed to develop a
unique platform to collect and preprocess large amounts of ATC data from
airspace in real time. Audio and surveillance data were collected from publicly
accessible radio frequency channels with VHF receivers owned by a community of
volunteers and later uploaded to Opensky Network servers, which can be
considered an ""unlimited source"" of data. In addition, this paper reviews
previous work from ATCO2 partners, including (i) robust automatic speech
recognition, (ii) natural language processing, (iii) English language
identification of ATC communications, and (iv) the integration of surveillance

project, along with the open-sourcing of its data, will encourage research in
the ATC field. A sample of the ATCO2 corpus is available on the following

CNN-TDNNf kaldi model, we reached the performance of as low as 17.9% and 24.9%

ground-truth labels are not considered in the maximization, they are not able
to address imbalances between class labels. Rather, we interpret the

latent features and ground-truth labels. This approach integrates contrastive

terms of the phase shift, the linear susceptibilities, and the three-body
correlation functions, defined with respect to the equilibrium ground state of
the Anderson impurity model. In particular, the three-body correlations play an
essential role in the order $V^3$ term, and their coupling to the nonlinear
current depends crucially on the bias and tunnel asymmetries. The number of
independent components of the three-body correlation functions increases with
$N$ the internal degrees of the quantum dots, and it gives a variety in the
low-energy transport. We calculate the correlation functions over a wide range

$V^3$ nonlinear current through the SU($N$) Kondo state, which occurs at
electron fillings of $1$ and $N-1$ for strong Coulomb interactions,
significantly varies with the three-body contributions as tunnel asymmetries

according to their architectures: regression (i.e., heatmap-free) and
heatmap-based methods. The former one directly estimates precise coordinates of
each keypoint using convolutional and fully-connected layers. Although this
approach is able to detect overlapped and dense keypoints, unexpected results
can be obtained by non-existent keypoints in a scene. On the other hand, the
latter one is able to filter the non-existent ones out by utilizing predicted
heatmaps for each keypoint. Nevertheless, it suffers from quantization error
when obtaining the keypoint coordinates from its heatmaps. In addition, unlike
the regression one, it is difficult to distinguish densely placed keypoints in
an image. To this end, we propose a hybrid model for single-stage multi-person
pose estimation, named HybridPose, which mutually overcomes each drawback of
both approaches by maximizing their strengths. Furthermore, we introduce
self-correlation loss to inject spatial dependencies between keypoint
coordinates and their visibility. Therefore, HybridPose is capable of not only
detecting densely placed keypoints, but also filtering the non-existent
keypoints in an image. Experimental results demonstrate that proposed
HybridPose exhibits the keypoints visibility without performance degradation in
terms of the pose estimation accuracy.

  Conference on Quantum Computing & Engineering",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The design of high-fidelity quantum gates is difficult because it requires
the optimization of two competing effects, namely maximizing gate speed and
minimizing leakage out of the qubit subspace. We propose a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm that uses two agents to address the speed and leakage
challenges simultaneously. The first agent constructs the qubit in-phase
control pulse using a policy learned from rewards that compensate short gate
times. The rewards are obtained at intermediate time steps throughout the
construction of a full-length pulse, allowing the agent to explore the
landscape of shorter pulses. The second agent determines an out-of-phase pulse
to target leakage. Both agents are trained on real-time data from noisy
hardware, thus providing model-free gate design that adapts to unpredictable
hardware noise. To reduce the effect of measurement classification errors, the
agents are trained directly on the readout signal from probing the qubit. We
present proof-of-concept experiments by designing X and square root of X gates
of various durations on IBM hardware. After just 200 training iterations, our
algorithm is able to construct novel control pulses up to two times faster than
the default IBM gates, while matching their performance in terms of state
fidelity and leakage rate. As the length of our custom control pulses
increases, they begin to outperform the default gates. Improvements to the
speed and fidelity of gate operations open the way for higher circuit depth in
quantum simulation, quantum chemistry and other algorithms on near-term and

it is of interest to estimate the optimal treatment regime with a linear

promising pathway for low-loss plasmonic materials is the engineering of

show that this procedure can give more accurate and robust estimates on the

the received scattered waves and training data collected from forward
mathematical models. Recent advances in computing have led to increasing
attention towards functional inverse inference, which can reveal more detailed
properties of a hidden object. However, rigorous studies on functional inverse,
including the reconstruction of the functional input and quantification of
uncertainty, remain scarce. Motivated by an inverse scattering problem where
the objective is to infer the functional input representing the refractive
index of a bounded scatterer, a new Bayesian framework is proposed. It contains
a surrogate model that takes into account the functional inputs directly
through kernel functions, and a Bayesian procedure that infers functional
inputs through the posterior distribution. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian
framework is extended to reconstruct functional inverse by integrating
multi-fidelity simulations, including a high-fidelity simulator solved by
finite element methods and a low-fidelity simulator called the Born
approximation. When compared with existing alternatives developed by finite
basis expansion, the proposed method provides more accurate functional
recoveries with smaller prediction variations.

upon face templates or use the expression coefficients of templates as the
driving signal. Despite the promising progress, their performances are heavily
bound by the expression power and the tracking accuracy of the templates. In
this work, we present LatentAvatar, an expressive neural head avatar driven by
latent expression codes. Such latent expression codes are learned in an
end-to-end and self-supervised manner without templates, enabling our method to
get rid of expression and tracking issues. To achieve this, we leverage a
latent head NeRF to learn the person-specific latent expression codes from a
monocular portrait video, and further design a Y-shaped network to learn the
shared latent expression codes of different subjects for cross-identity
reenactment. By optimizing the photometric reconstruction objectives in NeRF,
the latent expression codes are learned to be 3D-aware while faithfully
capturing the high-frequency detailed expressions. Moreover, by learning a
mapping between the latent expression code learned in shared and
person-specific settings, LatentAvatar is able to perform expressive
reenactment between different subjects. Experimental results show that our
LatentAvatar is able to capture challenging expressions and the subtle movement
of teeth and even eyeballs, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art

differentiable rendering-based camera pose optimization and consistency-based
joint space exploration, which enables accurate end-to-end optimization of the

substances, such as chemicals and infectious particles, including
SARS-Covid-laden droplets and aerosols. However, they are prone to exposure to
stale air as the masks creat a microclimate influenced by the exhaled air. As a
result, exhaled air from the lungs accumulating in the mask produce a warm and
humid environment that has a high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2),
unsuitable for re-inhalation. Fans are a favourable option for respirators to
ventilate the mask and remove the stale air. This study utilized computational
fluid dynamics simulation consisting of a hybrid Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS)-large eddy simulation (LES) turbulence method to compare
the inhalation flow properties for different fan locations (bottom, top, and
side) with regular respirator breathing. Three mask positions, top, side, and
bottom, were evaluated under two breathing cycles (approximately 9.65s of
breathing time). The results demonstrated that adding a fan respirator
significantly decreased internal mask temperature, humidity, and CO2
concentration. The average CO2 concentration decreased by 87%, 67% and 73% for
locations bottom, top and side respectively. Whilst the top and side fan
locations enhanced the removal of the exhaled gas mixture, the bottom-fan
respirator was more efficient in removing the nostril jet gas mixture and
therefore provided the least barrier to respiratory function. The results
provide valuable insights into the benefits of fan respirators for long-term
use for reducing CO2 concentration, mask temperature, and humidity, improving
wearer safety and comfort in hazardous environments, especially during the

input coefficients because they require less data and computation, but these

additional data for estimation.
  In this study, the input coefficients are estimated by approximating the
generation process with an artificial neural network (ANN) to mitigate the
problems of the non-survey methods and to estimate the input coefficients with
higher precision. To avoid over-fitting due to the small data used, data
augmentation, called mixup, is introduced to increase the data size by
generating virtual regions through region composition and scaling.

in improving user experience. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as one
of the most effective recommender system models because they model the rich
relational information. The ever-growing volume of data can make training GNNs
prohibitively expensive. To address this, previous attempts propose to train
the GNN models incrementally as new data blocks arrive. Feature and structure
knowledge distillation techniques have been explored to allow the GNN model to
train in a fast incremental fashion while alleviating the catastrophic
forgetting problem. However, preserving the same amount of the historical
information for all users is sub-optimal since it fails to take into account
the dynamics of each user's change of preferences. For the users whose
interests shift substantially, retaining too much of the old knowledge can
overly constrain the model, preventing it from quickly adapting to the users'
novel interests. In contrast, for users who have static preferences, model
performance can benefit greatly from preserving as much of the user's long-term
preferences as possible. In this work, we propose a novel training strategy
that adaptively learns personalized imitation weights for each user to balance
the contribution from the recent data and the amount of knowledge to be

learning imitation weights via a comparison on five diverse datasets for three
state-of-art structure distillation based recommender systems. The performance
shows consistent improvement over competitive incremental learning techninques.

quantum networks because of their long qubit coherence time, high fidelity
single- and two-qubit gates, and their ability to generate photons entangled
with the qubit state of the ion. One method for creating ion-photon
entanglement is to exploit optically transitions from the P_(1/2) to S_(1/2)
levels, which naturally emit spin-photon entangled states. But these optical
transitions typically lie in the ultra-violet and visible wavelength regimes.
These wavelengths exhibit significant fiber-optic propagation loss, thereby
limiting the transfer of quantum information to tens of meters. Quantum
frequency conversion is essential to convert these photons to telecom
wavelengths so that they can propagate over long distances in fiber-based
networks, as well as for compatibility with the vast number of telecom-based
opto-electronic components. Here, we generate O-band telecom photons via a low
noise quantum frequency conversion scheme from photons emitted from the P_(1/2)

extend the popular HUMANEVAL benchmark and build HUMANEVAL+ with 81x

times. It raises fundamental questions not only on our understanding of
negative temperature of a bath in connection with thermodynamics but also on
the possibilities of constructing devices using such baths. In this work, we
study steady-state quantum thermodynamics involving baths with negative
temperatures. A bath with a negative temperature is created synthetically using
two baths of positive temperatures and weakly coupling these with a qutrit
system. These baths are then coupled to each other via a working system. At
steady-state, the laws of thermodynamics are analyzed. We find that whenever
the temperatures of these synthetic baths are identical, there is no heat flow,
which reaffirms the zeroth law. There is always a spontaneous heat flow for
different temperatures. In particular, heat flows from a bath with a negative
temperature to a bath with a positive temperature which, in turn, implies that
a bath with a negative temperature is `hotter' than a bath with a positive
temperature. This warrants an amendment in the Kelvin-Planck statement of the
second law, as suggested in earlier studies. In all these processes, the
overall entropy production is positive, as required by the Clausius statement
of the second law. We construct continuous heat engines operating between
positive and negative temperature baths. These engines yield maximum possible
heat-to-work conversion efficiency, that is, unity. We also study the
thermodynamic nature of heat from a bath with a negative temperature and find
that it is thermodynamic work but with negative entropy.

range of population values. The ranked set sampling process can be modified in
two extremely helpful ways: maximum ranked set sampling with unequal samples
and minimum ranked set sampling with unequal samples. They permit an increase
in set size without too many ranking errors being introduced. In this paper, we
are defining general weighted extropy (GWJ) of minimum and maximum ranked set
samples when samples are of unequal size (minRSSU and maxRSSU, respectively).
Stochastic comparison and monotone properties have been studied under different
situations. Additionally, we compare the extropy of these two sampling data
with that of ranked set sampling data and simple random sampling data. Finally,
Bounds of GWJ of minRSSU and maxRSSU have been obtained.

identifies visual primitives or enhances unseen composed entities, and as a
result, entanglement between state and object primitives cannot be fully

CZSL through tuning prompts, while uneven entanglement leads prompts to be
dragged into local optimum. In this paper, we take a further step to introduce
a novel Disentangled and Recurrent Prompt Tuning framework termed DRPT to
better tap the potential of VLMs in CZSL. Specifically, the state and object
primitives are deemed as learnable tokens of vocabulary embedded in prompts and
tuned on seen compositions. Instead of jointly tuning state and object, we
devise a disentangled and recurrent tuning strategy to suppress the traction
force caused by entanglement and gradually optimize the token parameters,
leading to a better prompt space. Notably, we develop a progressive fine-tuning
procedure that allows for incremental updates to the prompts, optimizing the
object first, then the state, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the optimization of
state and object is independent, thus clearer features can be learned to
further alleviate the issue of entangling misleading optimization. Moreover, we
quantify and analyze the entanglement in CZSL and supplement entanglement
rebalancing optimization schemes. DRPT surpasses representative
state-of-the-art methods on extensive benchmark datasets, demonstrating
superiority in both accuracy and efficiency.

transition by using a quasiparticle model. Results from our study indicate that
the coupling constant $g$ can stiffen the EOS of hybrid star matter and thus
increase the hybrid star maximum mass and its tidal deformability, whereas it
also decreases the mass and radius of the pure quark core. In addition, we find
that a step change of the sound velocity occurs in the hadron-quark mixed
phase, and it is restored with the decrease of nucleon and lepton degrees of
freedom in the high density quark phase. The approximate rule that the
polytropic index $\gamma \leq 1.75$ can also be used as a criterion for
separating hadronic from quark matter in our work. The hypothesis of absolutely
stable SQM (or ""Witten hypothesis"") suggests that a hybrid star containing a
sufficient amount of SQM in its core will rapidly convert into a strange quark
star. The SQM in hybrid stars therefore should break the absolutely stable
condition, and the energy per nucleon ($E/A$) of both $ud$QM and SQM must
exceed the lowest energy per nucleon 930 MeV. As a result, we provide the
maximum mass, minimum radius $R_{1.4}$ and minimum tidal deformation
$\Lambda_{1.4}$ of the hybrid stars as well as the maximum mass and radius of
the quark matter core with different $g$ values within the allowable regions

astrophysical observations and heavy-ion experiments for comparison, our
results indicate that the recently discovered massive neutron stars be well
described as hybrid stars in the quasiparticle model, and confirm that the

  planets with JWST","15 pages, 9 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Super-Earths present compositions dominated by refractory materials. However,
there is a degeneracy in their interior structure between a planet with no
atmosphere and a small Fe content, and a planet with a thin atmosphere and a
higher core mass fraction. To break this degeneracy, atmospheric
characterization observations are required. We present a self-consistent
interior-atmosphere model to constrain the volatile mass fraction, surface
pressure, and temperature of rocky planets with water and CO2 atmospheres.
These parameters obtained in our analysis can then be used to predict
observations in emission spectroscopy and photometry with JWST, which can
determine the presence of an atmosphere, and if present, its composition. To
obtain the bolometric emission and Bond albedo for an atmosphere in
radiative-convective equilibrium, we present the k-uncorrelated approximation
for fast computations within our retrieval on planetary mass, radius and host
stellar abundances. For the generation of emission spectra, we use our
k-correlated atmospheric model. An adaptive MCMC is used for an efficient
sampling of the parameter space at low volatile mass fractions. We show how to
use our modelling approach to predict observations with JWST for TRAPPIST-1 c
and 55 Cancri e. TRAPPIST-1 c's most likely scenario is a bare surface,
although the presence of an atmosphere cannot be ruled out. If the emission in
the MIRI F1500 filter is 731 ppm or higher, there would be a water-rich
atmosphere. For fluxes between 730 and 400 ppm, no atmosphere is present, while
low emission fluxes (300 ppm) indicate a CO2-dominated atmosphere. In the case
of 55 Cancri e, a combined spectrum with NIRCam and MIRI LRS may present high
uncertainties at wavelengths between 3 and 3.7 $\mu$m. However, this does not
affect the identification of H2O and CO2 because they do not present spectral
features in this wavelength range.

The approach presented is an alternative to the various direct

system has many benefits, such as significant reduction of the algorithm
complexity by merging most traction system functionalities into one. Such a
system enables significant simplification, unification, and standardization of
powertrain control design. Moreover, many signals needed by conventional
traction force allocation methods are not required to be measured or estimated
with the proposed approach, which are among others vehicle mass, wheel loading

trajectory setpoints and measurements are transformed to each wheel, where the
tracking is ensured using the wheel torque actuation. The proposed control
architecture performance and analysis are shown using the nonlinear twin-track
vehicle model implemented in Matlab $\&$ Simulink environment. The performance
is then validated using high fidelity FEE CTU in Prague EFORCE formula model

previous augmented-reality (AR)-based virtual try-on methods, DreamPaint does
not use, nor does it require, 3D modeling of neither the e-commerce product nor
the user context. Instead, it directly uses 2D images of the product as
available in product catalog database, and a 2D picture of the context, for
example taken from the user's phone camera. The method relies on few-shot fine
tuning a pre-trained diffusion model with the masked latents (e.g., Masked
DreamBooth) of the catalog images per item, whose weights are then loaded on a
pre-trained inpainting module that is capable of preserving the characteristics
of the context image. DreamPaint allows to preserve both the product image and
the context (environment/user) image without requiring text guidance to
describe the missing part (product/context). DreamPaint also allows to
intelligently infer the best 3D angle of the product to place at the desired
location on the user context, even if that angle was previously unseen in the

that the receiver knows the spatial signature of the jammer interference.
Estimating this signature is easy for barrage jammers that transmit
continuously and with static signature, but difficult for more sophisticated
jammers: Smart jammers may deliberately suspend transmission when the receiver
tries to estimate their spatial signature, they may use time-varying
beamforming to continuously change their spatial signature, or they may stay
mostly silent and jam only specific instants (e.g., transmission of control
signals). To deal with such smart jammers, we propose MASH, the first method
that indiscriminately mitigates all types of jammers: Assume that the
transmitter and receiver share a common secret. Based on this secret, the
transmitter embeds (with a linear time-domain transform) its signal in a secret
subspace of a higher-dimensional space. The receiver applies a reciprocal
linear transform to the receive signal, which (i) raises the legitimate
transmit signal from its secret subspace and (ii) provably transforms any
jammer into a barrage jammer, which makes estimation and mitigation via MIMO
processing straightforward. We show the efficacy of MASH for data transmission

$f\sigma_8$ onto the $\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane, we find that the model
constraints without assembly bias overlap with Planck expectations, but that
allowing assembly bias introduces significant tension with Planck, preferring
either a lower $\Omega_m$ or a lower $\sigma_8$. We also study the effect of

and membrane trafficking. In phospholipid systems, a range of fusogens
including divalent cations and depletants have been shown to induce adhesion,
hemifusion, and then full content fusion between vesicles. This works shows
that these fusogens do not perform the same function for fatty acid vesicles,
which are used as model protocells (primitive cells). Even when fatty acid
vesicles appear adhered or hemifused to each other, the intervening barriers
between vesicles do not rupture. This difference is likely because fatty acids
have a single aliphatic tail, and are more dynamic than their phospholipid
counterparts. To address this, we postulate that fusion could instead occur
under conditions, such as lipid exchange, that disrupt lipid packing. Using
both experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we verify that fusion in
fatty acid systems can indeed be induced by lipid exchange. These results begin
to probe how membrane biophysics could constrain the evolutionary dynamics of
protocells.

tremendous image-text pairs from scratch can be exceedingly resource-consuming,
connecting an existing LLM with a comparatively lightweight visual prompt
generator (VPG) becomes a feasible paradigm. However, further tuning the VPG
part of the VL-LLM still suffers from indispensable computational costs, i.e.,
requiring thousands of GPU hours and millions of training data. One alternative
solution is to transfer an existing VPG from any existing VL-LLMs for the
target VL-LLM.
  In this work, we for the first time investigate the VPG transferability
across LLMs, and explore a solution to reduce the cost of VPG transfer. We
first study the VPG transfer across different LLM sizes (e.g., small-to-large),
and across different LLM types, through which we diagnose the key factors to
maximize the transfer efficiency. Based on our observation, we design a
two-stage transfer framework named VPGTrans, which is simple yet highly
effective. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that VPGTrans helps
significantly speed up the transfer learning process without compromising
performance. Remarkably, it helps achieve the VPG transfer from BLIP-2
OPT$_\text{2.7B}$ to BLIP-2 OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ with over 10 times speed-up and
10.7% training data compared with connecting a VPG to OPT$_\text{6.7B}$ from

hamiltonians is adiabatic state preparation, in which an easy to prepare state
is time-evolved towards an approximate ground state under a specific
time-dependent hamiltonian. However, which path to take in the evolution is
often unclear, and a direct linear interpolation, which is the most common
method, may not be optimal. In this work, we explore new types of adiabatic
paths based on an eigendecomposition of the coefficient tensor in the second
quantised representation of the difference between the final and initial
hamiltonian (the residual hamiltonian). Since there is a direct correspondence
between this tensor and a projection of the residual hamiltonian onto the
subspace of two particles, this approach is essentially a two-body spectral
decomposition. We show how for general hamiltonians, the adiabatic time
complexity may be upper bounded in terms of the number of one-body modes $L$
and a minimal gap $\Delta$ along the path. Our finding is that the complexity
is determined primarily by the degree of pairing in the two-body states. As a
result, systems whose two-body eigenstates are uniform superpositions of
distinct fermion pairs tend to exhibit maximal complexity, which scales as
$O(L^4/\Delta^3)$ in direct interpolation and $O(L^6/\Delta^3)$ in an evolution
that follows a path along the corners of a hypercube in parameter space. The
usefulness of our method is demonstrated through a few examples involving
Fermi-Hubbard models where, due to symmetries, level crossings occur in direct
interpolation. We show that our method of decomposing the residual hamiltonian
and thereby deviating from a direct path appropriately breaks the relevant
symmetries, thus avoiding level crossings and enabling an adiabatic passage.

free-stream Mach number and surface temperature greatly influence aerodynamic
drag and heat transfer. The interplay of these two parameters strongly affects
the near-wall dynamics of high-speed turbulent boundary layers in a non-trivial
way, breaking similarity arguments on velocity and temperature fields,
typically derived for adiabatic cases. In this work, we present direct
numerical simulations of flat-plate zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary
layers spanning three free-stream Mach numbers [2,4,6] and four wall
temperature conditions (from adiabatic to very cold walls), emphasising the
choice of the diabatic parameter $\mathit{\Theta}$ (Zhang, Bi, Hussain & She,
J. Fluid Mech., vol. 739, pp. 392-420) to recover a similar flow organisation
at different Mach numbers. We link qualitative observations on flow patterns to
first- and second-order statistics to explain the strong decoupling of
temperature-velocity fluctuations that occurs at reduced wall temperatures and
high Mach numbers. For these cases, we find that the mean temperature gradient
in the near-wall region can reach such a strong intensity that it promotes the
formation of a secondary peak of thermal production in the viscous sublayer,
which is in direct contrast with the monotonic behaviour of adiabatic profiles.
We propose different physical mechanisms induced by wall-cooling and
compressibility that result in apparently similar flow features, such as a
higher peak in the streamwise velocity turbulence intensity, and distinct ones,
such as the separation of turbulent scales.

coupled to the accelerated expansion of the universe, potentially becoming a
candidate for dark energy. This would imply BH mass growth following the
cosmological expansion, with the masses of individual BHs growing as $M_{\rm
BH}\propto (1+z)^3$. In this letter, we discuss the binary systems Gaia BH1 and
Gaia BH2, which contain $\sim 9\,M_{\odot}$ BHs orbited by $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$
stars in widely-separated orbits. The ages of both systems can be constrained
by the properties of the luminous stars. If BH masses are indeed growing as
$(1+z)^3$, the masses of both BHs at formation would have been significantly
smaller than today. We find a 77% probability that the mass of the BH in Gaia
BH2 would have been below $2.2M_\odot$ at formation. This is below the
classical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov limit, though it is not yet clear if BHs
subject to cosmological coupling should obey this limit. For Gaia BH1, the same
probability is 70%. This analysis is consistent with results from two BHs in
the globular cluster NGC3201, but unlike the NGC3201 BHs, the Gaia BHs have
well-constrained inclinations and thus firm upper mass limits. The discovery of
more BHs in binary systems with Gaia astrometry in the coming years will allow
us to test the cosmological coupling hypothesis decisively.

high-resolution human point clouds as a combination of geometric priors and

This force might be important in rapidly rotating stars such as solar analogues
due to its $\Omega^2$ scaling, where $\Omega$ is the rotation rate of the star.
We study the effects of the centrifugal force in a set of 21 semi-global
stellar dynamo simulations with varying rotation rates. Among these, we include
three control runs aimed at distinguishing the effects of the centrifugal force
from the nonlinear evolution of the solutions. We solve the 3D MHD equations
with the Pencil Code in a solar-like convective zone in a spherical wedge setup
with a $2\pi$ azimuthal extent. We decompose the magnetic field in spherical
harmonics and study the migration of azimuthal dynamo waves (ADWs), energy of
different large-scale magnetic modes, and differential rotation. In the regime
with the lowest rotation rates, $\Omega = 5-10\Omega_\odot$, where
$\Omega_\odot$ is the rotation rate of the Sun, we see no marked changes in
neither the differential rotation nor the magnetic field properties. For
intermediate rotation with $\Omega = 20-25\Omega_\odot$ we identify an increase
of the differential rotation as a function of centrifugal force. The
axisymmetric magnetic energy tends to decrease with centrifugal force while the
non-axisymmetric one increases. The ADWs are also affected, especially the
propagation direction. In the most rapidly rotating set with
$\Omega=30\Omega_\odot$, these changes are more pronounced and in one case the
propagation direction of the ADW changes from prograde to retrograde. Control
runs suggest that the results are a consequence of the centrifugal force and
not due to the details of the initial conditions or the history of the run. We
find that the differential rotation and properties of the ADWs change as a
function of the centrifugal force only when rotation is rapid enough.

spin Hall effect of light. On the other hand, Maxwell's equations have the
remarkable property of conformal invariance. This property is a cornerstone of
Weyl geometry and the corresponding gravitational theories. As a first step in
our study, we obtain the polarization-dependent ray equations in Weyl geometry,
describing the gravitational spin Hall effect of light in the presence of
nonmetricity. As a specific example of the spin Hall effect of light in Weyl
geometry, we consider the case of the simplest conformally invariant action,
constructed from the square of the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl
vector only. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an
auxiliary scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an
exact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild
solution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear
and a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate. We numerically study the
polarization-dependent propagation of light rays in this exact Weyl geometric
metric, and the effects of the presence of the Weyl vector on the magnitude of
the spin Hall effect are estimated.

one is given an undirected planar graph $G$ and two sets of vertices $S$ and

such that we separate all of $S$ from all of $T$, while maintaining that every
vertex in $S$, and respectively in $T$, stays in the same connected component.
We show that this problem can be solved in time $2^{|S|+|T|} n^{O(1)}$ with a
one-sided error randomized algorithm. Our algorithm implies a polynomial-time
algorithm for the network diversion problem on planar graphs, which resolves an
open question from the literature. More generally, we show that Two-Sets

Waterfall for high-quality software development. However, limited research has
been conducted on exploring software development approaches concerning
practitioners discussions on Q&A forums. Objective: We conducted an empirical
study to analyze developers discussions on Q&A forums to gain insights into
software development approaches in practice. Method: We analyzed 13,903
developers posts across Stack Overflow (SO), Software Engineering Stack
Exchange (SESE), and Project Management Stack Exchange (PMSE) forums. A mixed
method approach, consisting of the topic modeling technique (i.e., Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)) and qualitative analysis, is used to identify
frequently discussed topics of software development approaches, trends
(popular, difficult topics), and the challenges faced by practitioners in
adopting different software development approaches. Findings: We identified 15
frequently mentioned software development approaches topics on Q&A sites and
observed an increase in trends for the top-3 most difficult topics requiring
more attention. Finally, our study identified 49 challenges faced by
practitioners while deploying various software development approaches, and we
subsequently created a thematic map to represent these findings. Conclusions:
The study findings serve as a useful resource for practitioners to overcome
challenges, stay informed about current trends, and ultimately improve the
quality of software products they develop.

  crowdsourced delivery",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High demand, rising customer expectations, and government regulations are
forcing companies to increase the efficiency and sustainability of urban
(last-mile) distribution. Consequently, several new delivery concepts have been
proposed that increase flexibility for customers and other stakeholders. One of
these innovations is crowdsourced delivery, where deliveries are made by
occasional drivers who wish to utilize their surplus resources (unused
transport capacity) by making deliveries in exchange for some compensation. In
addition to reducing delivery costs, the potential benefits of crowdsourced
delivery include better utilization of transport capacity, a reduction in
overall traffic, and increased flexibility (by scaling up and down delivery
capacity as needed). The use of occasional drivers poses new challenges because
(unlike traditional couriers) neither their availability nor their behavior in
accepting delivery offers is certain. The relationship between the compensation
offered to occasional drivers and the probability that they will accept a task
has been largely neglected in the scientific literature. Therefore, we consider
a setting in which compensation-dependent acceptance probabilities are
explicitly considered in the process of assigning delivery tasks to occasional
drivers. We propose a mixed-integer nonlinear model that minimizes the expected
delivery costs while identifying optimal assignments of tasks to a mix of
traditional and occasional drivers and their compensation. We propose exact
linearization schemes for two practically relevant probability functions and an
approximate linearization scheme for the general case. The results of our
computational study show clear advantages of our new approach over existing
ones.

Here we propose an alternative paradigm based on curvature, rather than

tungsten diselenide (WSe2). We probe these nanostructures using tip-enhanced
optical spectroscopy to reveal the spatial localisation of out-of-plane
polarised emission from the WSe2 wrinkles. Based on the photoluminescence and
Raman scattering signatures resolved with nanoscale spatial resolution, we
propose the existence of a manifold of spin-forbidden excitonic states that are
activated by the local curvature of the WSe2. We are able to access these dark

in enhanced strongly localised emission at room temperature, which is of

However, collecting sufficient dialogues that are naturally grounded on

mitigate the data sparsity issue, we propose a plan-based data augmentation
(PlanDA) approach that generates diverse synthetic dialog data at scale by
transforming concise flowchart into dialogues. Specifically, its generative
model employs a variational-base framework with a hierarchical planning

renowned $f(R)$ theories, by making the Einstein field equations of the theory
to also depend on $T$. While such a dependence can be motivated by quantum
effects, the existence of imperfect or extra fluids, or even a cosmological
``constant'' which effectively depends on $T$, the formalism can truly surpass
some deficiencies of $f(R)$ gravity. As the $f(R,T)$ function is arbitrary,
several parametric models have been proposed {\it ad hoc} in the literature and
posteriorly confronted with observational data. In the present article, we use
gaussian process to construct an $f(R,T)=R+f(T)$ model. To apply the gaussian
process we use a series of measurements of the Hubble parameter. We then
analytically obtain the functional form of the function. By construction, this
form, which is novel in the literature, is well-adjusted to cosmological data.
In addition, by extrapolating our reconstruction to redshift $z=0$, we were
able to constrain the Hubble constant value to $H_0=69.97\pm4.13$$\rm \ km \

of the functional form herewith obtained to other current problems of

of the Higgs boson, which, depending on some technical details in the

allows the Standard Model (SM) to hold up to the Planck scale about
$\Lambda_{\rm Pl} \sim 10^{19}~{\rm GeV}$. One then has the possibility that
the Higgs boson not only provides mass for all SM-particles but very likely
also has supplied dark energy that inflated the young universe shortly after
the Big Bang. The SM Higgs boson is a natural candidate for the Inflaton, and
the Higgs boson decays are able to reheat the universe after inflation. I argue
that the structures of the SM evolve naturally from a Planck cutoff medium
(ether) and thus find their explanation. That the SM is an emergent structure
is also strongly supported by Veltman's derivation of the SM from some general
principles, which we can understand as the result of a low-energy expansion. I
emphasize the role of the hierarchy problem and the problem of the cosmological
constant as causal for the Higgs inflation scenario. After the discovery of the
Higgs boson at 125 GeV, and considering the absence of beyond the SM particles
at the LHC, a new view on the SM of particle physics and its role in early
cosmology has become indispensable. Very likely, the spectacular Higgs
discovery turned out to have completed the SM in an unexpected way, revealing
it as an inescapable emergence which shapes the early universe.

assignment constraints. In this constraint framework, the sizes and values of
the goods are agent-specific, and one needs to allocate the goods among the
agents fairly while further ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of total
size at most the corresponding budget of the agent. Since, in such a constraint
setting, it may not always be feasible to partition all the goods among the
agents, we conform -- as in recent works -- to the construct of charity to
designate the set of unassigned goods. For this allocation framework, we obtain
existential and computational guarantees for envy-free (appropriately defined)
allocation of divisible and indivisible goods, respectively, among agents with
individual, additive valuations for the goods.
  We deem allocations to be fair by evaluating envy only with respect to
feasible subsets. In particular, an allocation is said to be feasibly envy-free
(FEF) iff each agent prefers its bundle over every (budget) feasible subset
within any other agent's bundle (and within the charity). The current work
establishes that, for divisible goods, FEF allocations are guaranteed to exist
and can be computed efficiently under generalized assignment constraints.
  In the context of indivisible goods, FEF allocations do not necessarily
exist, and hence, we consider the fairness notion of feasible envy-freeness up
to any good (FEFx). We show that, under generalized assignment constraints, an
FEFx allocation of indivisible goods always exists. In fact, our FEFx result
resolves open problems posed in prior works. Further, for indivisible goods and
under generalized assignment constraints, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time
algorithm for computing FEFx allocations, and a fully polynomial-time
approximation scheme (FPTAS) for computing approximate FEFx allocations.

potential gains.} In this paper, we conceive a multi-cell FD networking scheme
by deploying a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) at the cell boundary to
configure the radio environment proactively. To achieve the full potential of
the system, we aim to maximize the sum rate (SR) of multiple cells by jointly
optimizing the transmit precoding (TPC) matrices at FD base stations (BSs) and
users and the phase shift matrix at RIS. Since the original problem is
non-convex, we reformulate and decouple it into a pair of subproblems by
utilizing the relationship between the SR and minimum mean square error (MMSE).
The optimal solutions of TPC matrices are obtained in closed form, while both
complex circle manifold (CCM) and successive convex approximation (SCA) based
algorithms are developed to resolve the phase shift matrix suboptimally. Our
simulation results show that introducing an RIS into an FD networking system
not only improves the overall SR significantly but also enhances the cell edge
performance prominently. More importantly, we validate that the RIS deployment
with optimized phase shifts can reduce the requirement for SIC and the number
of BS antennas, which further reduces the hardware cost and power consumption,
especially with a sufficient number of reflecting elements. As a result, the
utilization of an RIS enables the originally cumbersome FD networking system to
become efficient and practical.

been proposed to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio. Active research is
currently focused on establishing secure and practical quantum communication in
a high-loss channel, and enhancing the secure key rate by implementing bit
rejection strategies when the channel transmittance drops below a certain
threshold. By simulating the atmospheric turbulence using an
acousto-optical-modulator (AOM) and implementing the prefixed-threshold
real-time selection (P-RTS) method, our group performed finite-size decoy-state
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol for 19 dB
channel loss. With better optical calibration and efficient superconducting
nano-wire single photon detector (SNSPD), we have extended our previous work to
40 dB channel loss characterizing the transmittance distribution of our system
under upper moderate turbulence conditions.

reconstructed by stacking and averaging the generated HR slices. Our proposed
framework has two major advantages: (1) It only involves the
arbitrary-resolution anisotropic MR volumes, which greatly improves the model
practicality in real MR imaging scenarios (e.g., clinical brain image
acquisition); (2) The INR-based SR model enables arbitrary-scale image SR from

address this challenge, we propose a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-based

eigenvectors associated with the larger singular values decomposed from the
middle layer features exhibit superior generalization and attention properties.
Specifically, we conduct the attack by retaining the decomposed Top-1 singular
value-associated feature for computing the output logits, which are then
combined with the original logits to optimize adversarial examples. Our
extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method,
which can be easily integrated into various baselines to significantly enhance

intermediate liquid film separating the bubbles begins to drain. Once the film
ruptures, the bubbles coalesce and form a neck that expands with time. The
dynamics of the neck growth are well understood in the context of pure,
Newtonian liquids. Yet, much less is known about the dynamics of this
singularity when the surrounding liquid contains long flexible polymers, which
provide viscoelastic characteristics to the liquid's properties. Here, we
experimentally study the coalescence of bubbles surrounded by polymer
solutions. In contrast to drop coalescence, and in spite of the singular
stretching of polymers, we find that the presence of the dissolved polymers
does not at all affect the coalescence dynamics at early times. The polymer
elasticity is found to slow down the flow only during the later stages of
coalescence. These observations are interpreted using an asymptotic solution of
the Oldroyd-B model, which predicts a strong stress singularity near the
extremity of the neck. However, the polymer stress turns out to diverge only in
the azimuthal direction, which can explain why elastic effects remain
subdominant during the initial stages of coalescence.

through its survival of hundreds of seconds before collapsing into a black hole
(BH). If this is the case, the SMNS can emit continuous gravitational waves
(GW) and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, particularly in the X-ray band. In
this work, the ellipticity and initial frequency of SMNS are constrained with a
Bayesian framework using simulated X-ray and GW signals, which could be
detected by The Transient High Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS)

X-ray emission can not completely constrain the initial frequency and
ellipticity of the SMNS, but it can reduce the ranges of the parameters.

understudied area of research. Generally, hand hygiene skills are regarded as a
key contributor to reduce critical infections and healthcare-associated
infections. In a clinical setup, at a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), the
outcome of a multi-modal training initiative was recorded, where objective
feedback was provided to the staff. It was hypothesized that staff at the NICU
are more sensitive towards applying increased patient safety measures. Outcomes
were recorded as the ability to cover all hand surfaces with Alcohol-Based
Handrub (ABHR), modelled as a time-series of measurements. The learning ability
to rub in with 1.5 mL and with 3 mL was also assessed. As a secondary outcome,
handrub consumption and infection numbers were recorded. It has been observed
that some staff members were able to quickly learn the proper hand hygiene,
even with the limited 1.5 mL, while others were not capable of acquiring the
technique even with 3 mL. When analyzing the 1.5 mL group, it was deemed an
insufficient ABHR amount, while with 3 mL, the critical necessity of skill
training to achieve complete coverage was documented. Identifying these
individuals helps the infection control staff to better focus their training
efforts. The training led to a 157% increase in handrub consumption. The
setting of the study did not allow to show a measurable reduction in the number
of hospital infections. It has been concluded that the training method chosen
by the staff greatly affects the quality of the outcomes.

space. A well-known non-parametric objective is to embed the metric space into
a simpler structured metric space such as a line (i.e., Linear Arrangement) or
a binary tree (i.e., Hierarchical Clustering). Points which are close in the
metric space should be mapped to close points/leaves in the line/tree;
similarly, points which are far in the metric space should be far in the line
or on the tree. In particular we consider the Maximum Linear Arrangement
problem \cite{Approximation_algorithms_for_maximum_linear_arrangement} and the
Maximum Hierarchical Clustering problem
\cite{Hierarchical_Clustering:_Objective_Functions_and_Algorithms} applied to
metrics.
  We design approximation schemes ($1 - \epsilon$ approximation for any
constant $\epsilon > 0$) for these objectives. In particular this shows that by
considering metrics one may significantly improve former approximations ($0.5$
for Max Linear Arrangement and $0.74$ for Max Hierarchical Clustering). Our
main technique, which is called multi-layer peeling, consists of recursively
peeling off points which are far from the ""core"" of the metric space. The
recursion ends once the core becomes a sufficiently densely weighted metric
space (i.e. the average distance is at least a constant times the diameter) or
once it becomes negligible with respect to its inner contribution to the
objective. Interestingly, the algorithm in the Linear Arrangement case is much
more involved than that in the Hierarchical Clustering case, and uses a
significantly more delicate peeling.

filled with perovskite microplates, the pronounced TE-TM splitting gives rise
to a strong SOC that leads to the spatial instability of microcavity polariton
condensates under single-shot excitation. Spatially varying hole burning and
mode competition occurs between polarization components leading to different
condensate profiles from shot to shot. The single-shot polariton condensates
become stable when the SOC vanishes as the TE and TM modes are spectrally well
separated from each other, which can be achieved by application of an electric
field to our LC microcavity with electrically tunable anisotropy. Our findings
are well reproduced and traced back to their physical origin by our detailed

SpecT. However, its practical formulation rSpecT is known to be sensitive to

paper, we give the first condition that guarantees the infeasibility of rSpecT
and design a novel model (LogSpecT) and its practical formulation (rLogSpecT)
to overcome this issue. Contrary to rSpecT, the novel practical model rLogSpecT
is always feasible. Furthermore, we provide recovery guarantees of rLogSpecT,
which are derived from modern optimization tools related to epi-convergence.
These tools could be of independent interest and significant for various

highly efficient algorithm based on the linearized alternating direction method

the quoted composition of their fuel (a solid boron composite, binding high

bremsstrahlung losses associated with the presence of boron. To facilitate
ignition, Ruhl and Korn also consider the reduction of the bremsstrahlung
losses by confining the radiation in the optically thin fuel region by high Z

temperature equals approximately that of the plasma constituents $T_{r} \approx

Normalized reflectances over 6 500--8 500 AA for its inner and outer comae are
9.7+/-0.5 and 7.2+/-0.3 % (10^3 AA)^-1, respectively, the latter being
consistent with the slope observed when the comet was beyond the orbit of
Saturn. The dust coma at the time of observation appears to contain three
distinct populations: mm-sized chunks prevailing at <~10^3 km; a 10^5-km
steady-state dust envelope; and fresh anti-sunward jet particles. the dust
chunks dominate the continuum signal and are distributed over a similar radial
distance scale as the coma region with redder dust than nearby. they also
appear to be co-spatial with OI1D, suggesting that the chunks may accommodate
H2O ice with a fraction (>~1 %) of refractory materials. The jet particles do
not colocate with any gas species detected. The outer coma spectrum contains
three significant emissions from C2(0,0) Swan band, OI1D, and CN(1,0 red band,
with an overall deficiency in NH2. Assuming that all OI1D flux results from H2O
dissociation, we compute an upper limit on the water production rate Q_H2O of
~7 x 10^28 molec s^-1 (with an uncertainty of a factor of two). the production
ratio log[Q_C2/Q_CN] of K2 suggests that the comet has typical carbon-chain
composition, with the value potentially changing with distance from the Sun.
Our observations suggest that water ice-containing dust chunks (>0.1 mm) near

rotational temperature and the discrepancy between its optical and infrared

weight-based pruning (LTH) determines the pruned global model structure; (ii)
the iterative pruning further shrinks the size of the pruned model's

validation based on the Laplace mechanism. On the client side, we use
sparse-to-sparse training to solve the resource-constraints issue and provide
tighter privacy analysis to reduce the privacy budget. We evaluate the

identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings. The results clearly confirm
the superiority of Fed-LTP over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in

Universe are known to correlate with other galaxy properties via the ``HI
scaling relations''. The redshift evolution of these relations serves as an
important constraint on models of galaxy evolution. However, until recently,
there were no estimates of the HI scaling relations at cosmological distances.
Using data from a deep Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope HI 21 cm survey of the
Extended Groth Strip, and the technique of spectral line stacking, we determine
the scaling relation between the HI mass and the stellar mass for star-forming
galaxies at $z\approx0.35$. We use this measurement, along with the
main-sequence relation in galaxies, to infer the dependence of the HI depletion
timescale of these galaxies on their stellar mass. We find that massive
star-forming galaxies at $z\approx0.35$, with stellar mass $\rm M_*
\gtrsim10^{9.5}\:M_{\odot}$, are HI-poor compared to local star-forming
galaxies of a similar stellar mass. However, their characteristic HI depletion
time is lower by a factor of $\approx 5$ than that of their local analogues,
indicating a higher star-formation efficiency at intermediate redshifts
(similar to that at $z \approx 1$). While our results are based on a relatively
small cosmic volume and could thus be affected by cosmic variance, the short
characteristic HI depletion timescales ($\lesssim 3$ Gyr) of massive
star-forming galaxies at $z \approx 0.35$ indicate that they must have acquired
a significant amount of neutral gas through accretion from the circumgalactic
medium over the past four Gyr, to avoid quenching of their star-formation
activity.

LES results are based on a high order discontinuous Galerkin method and the
RANS is computed using a classical finite-volume approach. The paper discusses
the steps taken to create realistic inflow boundary conditions in terms of end
wall boundary layer thickness and free stream turbulence intensity. This is
achieved by tailoring the input distribution of total pressure and temperature,
Reynolds stresses and turbulent length scale to a Fourier series based
synthetic turbulence generator. With this procedure, excellent agreement with
the experiment can be achieved in terms of blade loading at midspan and wake
total pressure losses at midspan and over the channel height. Based on the
validated setup, we focus on the discussion of secondary flow structures
emerging due to the interaction of the incoming boundary layer and the turbine
blade and compare the LES to two commonly used RANS models. Since we are able
to create consistent setups for both LES and RANS, all discrepancies can be
directly attributed to physical modelling problems. We show that both a linear
eddy viscosity model and a differential Reynolds stress model coupled with a
state-of-the-art correlation-based transition model fail, in this case, to
predict the separation induced transition process around midspan. Moreover,
their prediction of secondary flow losses leaves room for improvement as shown

demographics (age, race, sex) in their latent representation, raising concerns

consider different types of invariance with respect to demographic attributes -
marginal, class-conditional, and counterfactual model invariance - and lay out
their equivalence to standard notions of algorithmic fairness. Drawing on
existing theory, we find that marginal and class-conditional invariance can be
considered overly restrictive approaches for achieving certain fairness
notions, resulting in significant predictive performance losses. Concerning
counterfactual model invariance, we note that defining medical image
counterfactuals with respect to demographic attributes is fraught with
complexities. Finally, we posit that demographic encoding may even be
considered advantageous if it enables learning a task-specific encoding of
demographic features that does not rely on human-constructed categories such as
'race' and 'gender'. We conclude that medical imaging models may need to encode
demographic attributes, lending further urgency to calls for comprehensive
model fairness assessments in terms of predictive performance.

to become dominated by the kinetic energy density of the scalar field after
inflation. Initially, the leading kinetic term is quartic and we call the
corresponding period hyperkination. Subsequently, the usual quadratic kinetic
term takes over and we have regular kination, until reheating. We study, both
analytically and numerically, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves
generated during inflation and re-entering the horizon during the subsequent
eras. We demonstrate that the spectrum is flat for modes re-entering during
radiation domination and hyperkination and linear in frequency for modes
re-entering during kination: kinetic domination boosts the spectrum, but
hyperkination truncates its peak. As a result, the effects of the kinetic
period can be extended to observable frequencies without generating excessive
gravitational waves, which could otherwise destabilise the process of Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. We show that there is ample parameter space for the primordial

and observed in nanoscale systems. While these polarization textures are
interesting and promising in terms of applications, their topology in general
is yet to be fully understood. For example, the relation between topological
polarization structures and band topology has not been explored, and polar
domain structures are typically considered in topologically trivial systems. In
particular, the local polarization in a crystal supercell is not well-defined,
and typically calculated using approximations which do not satisfy gauge
invariance. Furthermore, local polarization in supercells is typically
approximated using calculations involving smaller unit cells, meaning the
connection to the electronic structure of the supercell is lost. In this work,
we propose a definition of local polarization which is gauge invariant and can
be calculated directly from a supercell without approximations. We show using
first-principles calculations for commensurate bilayer hexagonal boron nitride
that our expressions for local polarization give the correct result at the unit

using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the realizable

derive the probability of infection. Our results reveal that the turbulence has
an irregular effect on the probability of infection, which shows itself by the

are fundaments of economic and social interactions. The trust game (TG) is
widely used for studying trust and trustworthiness and entails a sequential
interaction between two players, an investor and a trustee. It requires at
least two strategies or options for an investor (e.g. to trust versus not to
trust a trustee). According to the evolutionary game theory, the antisocial
strategies (e.g. not to trust) evolve such that the investor and trustee end up
with lower payoffs than those that they would get with the prosocial strategies
(e.g.to trust). A generalisation of the TG to a multiplayer (i.e.more than two
players) TG was recently proposed. However, its outcomes hinge upon two
assumptions that various real situations may substantially deviate from: (i)
investors are forced to trust trustees and (ii) investors can turn into
trustees by imitation and vice versa. We propose an asymmetric multiplayer TG
that allows investors not to trust and prohibits the imitation between players
of different roles; instead, investors learn from other investors and the same
for trustees. We show that the evolutionary game dynamics of the proposed TG
qualitatively depends on the nonlinearity of the payoff function and the amount
of incentives collected from and distributed to players through an institution.
We also show that incentives given to trustees can be useful and sufficient to
cost-effectively promote trust and trustworthiness among self-interested
players.

  In this work, a data-based formulation for computing the steady-state Kalman

developed, which is shown to be equivalent to the model-based LQG controller.
For cases where offline data are corrupted by noise, a robust data-based

for state estimation and input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) under

profile, on the two-dimensional surface. We use the $T$-matrix formalism to
numerically (analytically and numerically) capture the details of the momentum
space scattering in QPI (real space decay in LDOS), considering relevant
tight-binding lattice and/or low-energy continuum models modeling a range of
different WSMs. In particular, we consider multi-WSM (mWSM), hosting multiple
Fermi arcs between two opposite chirality Weyl nodes (WNs), where we find a
universal $1/r$-decay ($r$ measuring the radial distance from the impurity
core) of the impurity-induced LDOS, irrespective of the topological charge.
Interestingly, the inter-Fermi arc scattering is only present for triple WSMs,
where we find an additional $1/r^3$-decay as compared to double and single
WSMs. The untilted single (double) [triple] WSM shows a straight-line
(leaf-like) [oval-shaped] QPI profile. The above QPI profiles are canted for
hybrid WSMs where type-I and type-II Weyl nodes coexist, however, hybrid single
WSM demonstrates strong non-uniformity, unlike the hybrid double and triple
WSMs. We also show that the chirality and the positions of the Weyl nodes
imprint marked signatures in the QPI profile. This allows us to distinguish
between different WSMs, including the time-reversal-broken WSMs from the
time-reversal-invariant WSM, even though both of the WSMs can host two pairs of
Weyl nodes. Our study can thus shed light on experimentally obtainable complex
QPI profiles and help differentiate different WSMs and their surface band

algorithms was released in 2022 with 19 problems. We increase the size of this
archive to 63 problems and reproduce the previous comparison of baseline
algorithms. We then extend the comparison to include a wider range of standard
regressors and the latest versions of TSER models used in the previous study.
We show that none of the previously evaluated regressors can outperform a
regression adaptation of a standard classifier, rotation forest. We introduce
two new TSER algorithms developed from related work in time series
classification. FreshPRINCE is a pipeline estimator consisting of a transform
into a wide range of summary features followed by a rotation forest regressor.
DrCIF is a tree ensemble that creates features from summary statistics over
random intervals. Our study demonstrates that both algorithms, along with
InceptionTime, exhibit significantly better performance compared to the other
18 regressors tested. More importantly, these two proposals (DrCIF and
FreshPRINCE) models are the only ones that significantly outperform the
standard rotation forest regressor.

emission and near- to mid-infrared photometry we aim to characterize the
remnant formation disks around 5 unique pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars with
masses $6-12~\rm M_{\odot}$, that have constrained stellar parameters thanks to
their detectable photospheres. We seek to understand this emission and the
disks it originates from in the context of the evolutionary stage of the
studied sources. We use an analytic LTE disk model to fit the CO bandhead and
the dust emission, found to originate in different disk regions. For the first
time we modeled the 2nd overtone emission. Furthermore, we fit continuum
normalized bandheads and show the importance of this in constraining the
emission region. We also include $^{13}\rm CO$ in our models as an additional
probe of the young nature of the studied objects. We find that the CO emission
originates in a narrow region close to the star (<1 AU) and under very similar
disk conditions (temperatures and densities) for the different objects. This is
consistent with previous modeling of this emission in a diverse range of young
stellar objects. We discuss these results in the context of the positions of
these PMS stars in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram and the CO emission's
association with early age and high accretion rates in (massive) young stellar
objects. We conclude that, considering their mass range and for the fact that
their photospheres are detected, the M17 PMS stars are observed in a relatively
early formation stage. They are therefore excellent candidates for longer

example, an adversary may distort the sentiment of translated reviews to have
an exaggerated positive sentiment. In practice it is challenging to run
extensive human perception experiments, so a proxy deep-learning classifier

forecasting, when grouping the vaccines by type or location. However, forecasts
of different hierarchy levels become incoherent when higher levels do not match
the sum of the lower levels forecasts, which can be addressed by reconciliation
methods. In this paper, we tackle the vaccine sale forecasting problem by
modeling sales data from GSK between 2010 and 2021 as a hierarchical time
series. After forecasting future values with several ARIMA models, we
systematically compare the performance of various reconciliation methods, using
statistical tests. We also compare the performance of the forecast before and
after COVID. The results highlight Minimum Trace and Weighted Least Squares
with Structural scaling as the best performing methods, which provided a
coherent forecast while reducing the forecast error of the baseline ARIMA.

networks reported in the literature often contradict well-established
theoretical bounds. In this paper, we study the case of linear echo state
networks, for which the total memory capacity has been proven to be equal to
the rank of the corresponding Kalman controllability matrix. We shed light on
various reasons for the inaccurate numerical estimations of the memory, and we
show that these issues, often overlooked in the recent literature, are of an
exclusively numerical nature. More explicitly, we prove that when the Krylov
structure of the linear MC is ignored, a gap between the theoretical MC and its
empirical counterpart is introduced. As a solution, we develop robust numerical
approaches by exploiting a result of MC neutrality with respect to the input
mask matrix. Simulations show that the memory curves that are recovered using
the proposed methods fully agree with the theory.

  3-Section Constant-Curvature Robots","Robotics: Science and Systems 2023",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Piecewise constant curvature is a popular kinematics framework for continuum
robots. Computing the model parameters from the desired end pose, known as the
inverse kinematics problem, is fundamental in manipulation, tracking and
planning tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-solution solver to
address the inverse kinematics problem of 3-section constant-curvature robots
by bridging both the theoretical reduction and numerical correction. We derive
analytical conditions to simplify the original problem into a one-dimensional
problem. Further, the equivalence of the two problems is formalised. In
addition, we introduce an approximation with bounded error so that the one
dimension becomes traversable while the remaining parameters analytically
solvable. With the theoretical results, the global search and numerical
correction are employed to implement the solver. The experiments validate the
better efficiency and higher success rate of our solver than the numerical
methods when one solution is required, and demonstrate the ability of obtaining
multiple solutions with optimal path planning in a space with obstacles.

given by the complementary graph entropy $\overline{H}$ of the characteristic

pentagon graph with uniform distribution $G_5$, and for their disjoint union.
We consider two particular instances, where the characteristic graphs
respectively write as an AND product $\wedge$, and as a disjoint union
$\sqcup$. We derive a structural result that equates $\overline{H}(\wedge \:

which has two consequences. First, we prove that the cases where
$\overline{H}(\wedge \:\cdot)$ and $\overline{H}(\sqcup \: \cdot)$ can be
linearized coincide. Second, we determine $\overline{H}$ in cases where it was
unknown: products of perfect graphs; and $G_5 \wedge G$ when $G$ is a perfect
graph, using Tuncel et al.'s result for $\overline{H}(G_5 \sqcup G)$. The
graphs in these cases are not perfect in general.

  on Hybrid Vehicle Energy Management","12 pages, 12 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.AI cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many optimal control problems require the simultaneous output of continuous
and discrete control variables. Such problems are usually formulated as
mixed-integer optimal control (MIOC) problems, which are challenging to solve
due to the complexity of the solution space. Numerical methods such as
branch-and-bound are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time
control. This paper proposes a novel continuous-discrete reinforcement learning
(CDRL) algorithm, twin delayed deep deterministic actor-Q (TD3AQ), for MIOC
problems. TD3AQ combines the advantages of both actor-critic and Q-learning
methods, and can handle the continuous and discrete action spaces
simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a hybrid electric
vehicle (HEV) energy management problem, where real-time control of the
continuous variable engine torque and discrete variable gear ratio is essential
to maximize fuel economy while satisfying driving constraints. Simulation
results on different drive cycles show that TD3AQ can achieve near-optimal
solutions compared to dynamic programming (DP) and outperforms the
state-of-the-art discrete RL algorithm Rainbow, which is adopted for MIOC by
discretizing continuous actions into a finite set of discrete values.

  Explorer 35 Electromagnetic Sounding",,,,,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Constraints on the interior structure of the Moon have been derived from its
inductive response, principally as measured by the magnetic transfer function
(TF) between the distantly orbiting Explorer 35 satellite and the Apollo 12
surface station. The most successful prior studies used a dataset 0.01-1 mHz,
so the lunar response could be modeled as a simple dipole. However, earlier
efforts also produced transfer functions up to 40 mHz. The smaller
electromagnetic skin depth at higher frequency would better resolve the
uppermost mantle - where key information about primitive lunar evolution may
still be preserved - but requires a multipole treatment. I compute new profiles
of electrical conductivity vs depth using both the low-frequency and the
full-bandwidth ranges of published Apollo-Explorer TFs. I derive temperature
profiles at depths >400 km (<1 mHz) consistent with conductive heat loss and
expectations of the iron (and possibly water) content of the mantle. The
near-constant iron fraction (Mg# 81 +/- 7) implies either efficient mixing, due
to now-defunct convection or perhaps incomplete overturn of gravitationally
unstable cumulates following crystallization of the magma ocean. In contrast,
the full-bandwidth analysis produced a different conductivity profile that
could not be realistically matched by conduction, convection, partial melting,
or simple considerations of lateral heterogeneity. I conclude that the TF
method at the Moon is unreliable >>1 mHz. Future EM sounding using the
magnetotelluric method can operate up to 100s Hz and is largely insensitive to
multipole effects, resolving structure to 100 km or less.

various aspects of quantum physics such as benchmarking the performance of

naturally in a variety of physical models, including Rydberg setups. These are
referred to as approximate quantum state designs, and verifying their degree of
randomness can be an expensive task, similar to performing full quantum state

validate the character of approximate quantum designs with respect to data size

achieved by translating the information residing in the complex many-body state
into a succinct representation of classical data using a random projective
measurement basis, which is then processed, using methods of statistical

utilizing solution gradients computed and stored at nodes and demonstrate its
application to a third-order cell-centered finite-volume discretization on

efficient formula of computing a projected derivative. It is efficient in that
it completely eliminates the need to compute and store second derivatives of
solution variables or any other quantities, which are typically required in
upgrading a second-order cell-centered unstructured-grid finite-volume
discretization to third-order accuracy. Moreover, a high-order flux quadrature
formula, as required for third-order accuracy, can also be simplified by
utilizing the efficient projected-derivative formula, resulting in a numerical
flux at a face centroid plus a curvature correction not involving second
derivatives of the flux. Similarly, a source term can be integrated over a cell
to high-order in the form of a source term evaluated at the cell centroid plus
a curvature correction, again, not requiring second derivatives of the source
term. The discretization is defined as an approximation to an integral form of
a conservation law but the numerical solution is defined as a point value at a
cell center, leading to another feature that there is no need to compute and
store geometric moments for a quadratic polynomial to preserve a cell average.
Third-order accuracy and improved second-order accuracy are demonstrated and
investigated for simple but illustrative test cases in three dimensions.

applications such as location planning, unsupervised learning among others. In
such applications, it is important to find the clustering of points that is not
``skewed'' in terms of the number of points, i.e., no cluster should contain
too many points. This is modeled by capacity constraints on the sizes of
clusters. In an orthogonal direction, another important consideration in
clustering is how to handle the presence of outliers in the data. Indeed, these
clustering problems have been generalized in the literature to separately
handle capacity constraints and outliers. To the best of our knowledge, there
has been very little work on studying the approximability of clustering
problems that can simultaneously handle both capacities and outliers.
  We initiate the study of the Capacitated $k$-Median with Outliers (C$k$MO)
problem. Here, we want to cluster all except $m$ outlier points into at most
$k$ clusters, such that (i) the clusters respect the capacity constraints, and
(ii) the cost of clustering, defined as the sum of distances of each
non-outlier point to its assigned cluster-center, is minimized.
  We design the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for C$k$MO. In
particular, our algorithm returns a (3+\epsilon)-approximation for C$k$MO in
general metric spaces, and a (1+\epsilon)-approximation in Euclidean spaces of
constant dimension, that runs in time in time $f(k, m, \epsilon) \cdot
|I_m|^{O(1)}$, where $|I_m|$ denotes the input size. We can also extend these
results to a broader class of problems, including Capacitated
k-Means/k-Facility Location with Outliers, and Size-Balanced Fair Clustering
problems with Outliers. For each of these problems, we obtain an approximation
ratio that matches the best known guarantee of the corresponding outlier-free

modulation of the laser gain medium can enhance the gain saturation dynamics
and nonlinearities to generate self-starting FM combs. We demonstrate this with
tapered planarized THz quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). While simple ridge THz
QCLs typically generate combs which are a mixture of amplitude and frequency
modulation, the on-chip field enhancement resulting from extreme spatial
confinement leads to an ultrafast saturable gain regime, generating a pure FM
comb with a flatter intensity spectrum, a clear linear frequency chirp and very
intense beatnotes up to -30 dBm. The observed linear frequency chirp is
reproduced using a spatially inhomogeneous mean-field theory model which
confirms the crucial role of field enhancement. In addition, the modified
spatial temperature distribution within the waveguide results in an improved

comb bandwidths of 600 GHz at 90 K. The spatial inhomogeneity also leads to

refinement methods along with a window-based cross-attention ViT to squeeze the

with label distributions and multi-head self-attention mechanism to optimize
performance against weak predictions with reliability balancing, which is a
strategy that leverages anchor points, attention scores, and confidence values
to enhance the resilience of label predictions. To ensure correct label
classification and improve the models' discriminative power, we introduce
anchor loss, which encourages large margins between anchor points.
Additionally, the multi-head self-attention mechanism, which is also trainable,
plays an integral role in identifying accurate labels. This approach provides
critical elements for improving the reliability of predictions and has a
substantial positive effect on final prediction capabilities. Our adaptive
model can be integrated with any deep neural network to forestall challenges in
various recognition tasks. Our strategy outperforms current state-of-the-art
methodologies, according to extensive experiments conducted in a variety of

discs, many of which are suggestive of the presence of planets. Constraining
the mass of these putative planets is quite degenerate for it depends on the
disc physical properties, and for simplicity a steady-state is often assumed
whereby the planet position is kept fixed and there is a constant source of
dust at the outer edge of the disc. Here we argue against this approach by
demonstrating how the planet and dust dynamics can lift degeneracies of such
steady-state models. We take main disc parameters from the well-known
protoplanetary disc HD 163296 with a suspected planet at $R\approx 86$~au as an
example. By running gas and dust hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with
dust radiative transfer calculations, we first find steady-state disc and
planet parameters that reproduce ALMA continuum observations fairly well. For
the same disc mass, but now allowing the planet to migrate in the simulation,
we find that the planet undergoes runaway migration and reaches the inner disc
in $\sim 0.2$ Myr. Further, decreasing the disc mass slows down planet
migration, but it then also increases the dust's radial drift, thereby
depleting the disc dust faster. We find that the opposing constraints of planet
migration and dust drift require the disc mass to be at most $0.025~\msun$,
must less massive than previously estimated, and for the dust to be porous
rather than compact. We propose that similar analysis should be extended to
other sources with suspected planetary companions.

a more intuitive one, based on the reduction of the weighted 2-colimits to

from a lax slice. The preservation result is shown by proving a general theorem
of $\F$-category theory, which states that a lax left adjoint preserves
appropriate colimits if the adjunction is strict on one side and is suitably
$\F$-categorical. Finally, we apply this theorem of preservation of 2-colimits
to the 2-functor of change of base along a split Grothendieck opfibration
between lax slices, after showing that it is such a left adjoint by laxifying
the proof that Conduch\'{e} functors are exponentiable. We conclude extending
the result of preservation of 2-colimits for the change of base 2-functor to

immense value of physical memory savings, we are motivated to set

  Unfortunately no implementations of 2DBP algorithms for DSA are available.
This paper presents a first, though partial, implementation of the

makespan to the theoretical upper bound provided by the original authors. Along
the way, we identify and document key details to assist analogous future

  Our experiments comprise 4 modern allocators and 8 real application

terms of makespan, allocators outperform Robson's worst-case lower bound
$93.75\%$ of the time. In $87.5\%$ of cases, GNU's \texttt{malloc}
implementation demonstrates equivalent or superior performance to the 2DBP
state-of-the-art, despite the second operating offline.

fragmentation, producing up to $2.46$x better solutions. Future research can

tensor perturbations are largely unaffected by the loop corrections from the
short scalar modes. In particular, the spectrum of long tensor perturbations is
insensitive to the sharpness of the transition from the USR phase to the final
slow-roll phase. This is in contrast to the case of scalar power spectrum in
which the loop corrections can be large for a sharp transition while it is
slow-roll suppressed in a mild transition. We study the tensor-scalar-scalar
bispectrum in the squeezed limit and demonstrate that the Maldacena consistency
condition does hold.

While Cartesian-coordinate-based adaptive mesh refinement is commonly used for

a physics-informed clustering strategy centered on the K-means framework. The
method allows for the injection of underlying physical knowledge into the
clustering procedure through a distance function modification: instead of
leveraging conventional Euclidean distance vectors, the JSK-means procedure
operates on distance vectors scaled by matrices obtained from dynamical system
Jacobians evaluated at the cluster centroids. The goal of this work is to show
how the JSK-means algorithm -- without modifying the input dataset -- produces
clusters that capture regions of dynamical similarity, in that the clusters are
redistributed towards high-sensitivity regions in phase space and are described
by similarity in the source terms of samples instead of the samples themselves.
The algorithm is demonstrated on a complex reacting flow simulation dataset (a
channel detonation configuration), where the dynamics in the thermochemical
composition space are known through the highly nonlinear and stiff
Arrhenius-based chemical source terms. Interpretations of cluster partitions in
both physical space and composition space reveal how JSK-means shifts clusters
produced by standard K-means towards regions of high chemical sensitivity
(e.g., towards regions of peak heat release rate near the detonation reaction
zone). The findings presented here illustrate the benefits of utilizing
Jacobian-scaled distances in clustering techniques, and the JSK-means method in
particular displays promising potential for improving former partition-based
modeling strategies in reacting flow (and other multi-physics) applications.

linear media, including scattering by stochastic process, lossy media, and by
anisotropic inhomogeneities occurring at multiple length scales. Our
first-principles derivation makes explicit underlying assumptions and provides
jumping off points for more general treatments. The derivation also facilitates
a deeper understanding of soft scattering. It is demonstrated that sources of
scattering are not interfaces as is often presumed, but excess accelerating

also presented and discussed. For example, the scattering coefficient in the
large size RGD limit is shown to be proportional to the correlation length and
the variance of a projected phase shift.

the coupling between contact and deformation information which the sensor is

soft capacitive e-skin with a sparse electrode distribution and deep learning
for information decoupling. Our approach successfully separates tactile sensing
from geometric deformation, enabling touch recognition on a soft pneumatic
actuator subject to both internal (actuation) and external (manual handling)
forces. Using a multi-layer perceptron, the proposed e-skin achieves 99.88\%
accuracy in touch recognition across a range of deformations. When complemented
with prior knowledge, a transformer-based architecture effectively tracks the
deformation of the soft actuator. The average distance error in positional
reconstruction of the manipulator is as low as 2.905$\pm$2.207 mm, even under
operative conditions with different inflation states and physical contacts
which lead to additional signal variations and consequently interfere with
deformation tracking. These findings represent a tangible way forward in the
development of e-skins that can endow soft robots with proprioception and

infrastructure of modern society. To reliably operate GNSS, a highly accurate
and stable system time is required, such as the one provided by several
independent clocks hosted in Precise Timing Facilities (PTFs) around the world.
Periodically, the relative clock offset between PTFs is measured to have a
fallback system to synchronize the GNSS satellite clocks. The security and
integrity of the communication between PTFs is of paramount importance: if
compromised, it could lead to disruptions to the GNSS service. Therefore, it is

  for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entity alignment(EA) is a crucial task for integrating cross-lingual and
cross-domain knowledge graphs(KGs), which aims to discover entities referring
to the same real-world object from different KGs. Most existing methods
generate aligning entity representation by mining the relevance of triple
elements via embedding-based methods, paying little attention to triple
indivisibility and entity role diversity. In this paper, a novel framework
named TTEA -- Type-enhanced Ensemble Triple Representation via Triple-aware
Attention for Cross-lingual Entity Alignment is proposed to overcome the above
issues considering ensemble triple specificity and entity role features.
Specifically, the ensemble triple representation is derived by regarding
relation as information carrier between semantic space and type space, and
hence the noise influence during spatial transformation and information
propagation can be smoothly controlled via specificity-aware triple attention.
Moreover, our framework uses triple-ware entity enhancement to model the role
diversity of triple elements. Extensive experiments on three real-world
cross-lingual datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

The first three epochs are earlier than any Type II plateau supernova has been

three spectra are dominated by strong lines, primarily from metals, which
contrasts with the relatively featureless early optical spectra. The flux
decreases over the initial time series as the ejecta cools and line-blanketing
takes effect. We model this unique dataset with the non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium radiation transport code CMFGEN, finding a good match to the
explosion of a low mass red supergiant with energy Ekin = 6 x 10^50 erg. With

UV spectra. We also present optical photometry and spectroscopy, showing that
SN 2022acko has a peak absolute magnitude of V = -15.4 mag and plateau length
of ~115d. The spectra closely resemble those of SN 2005cs and SN 2012A. Using
the combined optical and UV spectra, we report the fraction of flux redwards of

group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels,"" including coronary heart

such as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and
obesity. These are predominantly influenced by lifestyle and behaviour,
including physical inactivity, unhealthy diets, high intake of salt, and
tobacco and alcohol use. However, genetics and social/environmental factors

studying the behavioural and environmental factors associated with these
""intermediate risk factors"" need access to high quality and detailed
information on diet and physical activity. However, missing data are a
pervasive problem in clinical and public health research, affecting both
randomized trials and observational studies. Reasons for missing data can vary
substantially across studies because of loss to follow-up, missed study visits,
refusal to answer survey questions, or an unrecorded measurement during an
office visit. One method of handling missing values is to simply delete
observations for which there is missingness (called Complete Case Analysis).
This is rarely used as deleting the data point containing missing data (List
wise deletion) results in a smaller number of samples and thus affects
accuracy. Additional methods of handling missing data exists, such as
summarizing the variables with its observed values (Available Case Analysis).
Motivated by the pervasiveness of missing data in the NHANES dataset, we will
conduct an analysis of imputation methods under different simulated patterns of
missing data. We will then apply these imputation methods to create a complete
dataset upon which we can use ordinary least squares to predict blood pressure

on valuing client contributions and works best when data across clients is

valuation, capable of valuing individual data points in federated and swarm
learning. DDVal is based on sharing deep features and approximating Shapley
values through a k-nearest neighbor approximation method. This allows for novel
applications, for example, to simultaneously reward institutions and
individuals for providing data to a decentralized machine learning task. The
valuation of data points through DDVal allows to also draw hierarchical
conclusions on the contribution of institutions, and we empirically show that
the accuracy of DDVal in estimating institutional contributions is higher than
existing Shapley value approximation methods for federated learning.
Specifically, it reaches a cosine similarity in approximating Shapley values of
99.969 % in both, IID and non-IID data distributions across institutions,
compared with 99.301 % and 97.250 % for the best state of the art methods.
DDVal scales with the number of data points instead of the number of clients,
and has a loglinear complexity. This scales more favorably than existing
approaches with an exponential complexity. We show that DDVal is especially
efficient in data distribution scenarios with many clients that have few data
points - for example, more than 16 clients with 8,000 data points each. By
integrating DDVal into a decentralized system, we show that it is not only
suitable for centralized federated learning, but also decentralized swarm

Encoder-Decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial

extra horizon-aware contexts generator (HACG) is dedicatedly designed to
consider the prior horizon information that enables us to perform multi-horizon
non-autoregressive prediction. Additionally, a differential prediction strategy
is designed by well considering both the stationarity of the differential
sequence and the high-bits errors of the BE representation. Moreover, the
Bit-wise Weighted Binary Cross Entropy loss function is proposed to optimize
the proposed framework that can further constrain the high-bits errors of the
predictions. Finally, the proposed framework is validated on a real-world

  Framework",,,,,"cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ground-air negotiation via speech communication is a vital prerequisite for
ensuring safety and efficiency in air traffic control (ATC) operations.
However, with the increase in traffic flow, incorrect instructions caused by
human factors bring a great threat to ATC safety. Existing flight trajectory
prediction (FTP) approaches primarily rely on the flight status of historical
trajectory, leading to significant delays in the prediction of real-time
maneuvering instruction, which is not conducive to conflict detection. A major
reason is that spoken instructions and flight trajectories are presented in
different modalities in the current air traffic control (ATC) system, bringing
great challenges to considering the maneuvering instruction in the FTP tasks.
In this paper, a spoken instruction-aware FTP framework, called SIA-FTP, is
innovatively proposed to support high-maneuvering FTP tasks by incorporating
instant spoken instruction. To address the modality gap and minimize the data
requirements, a 3-stage learning paradigm is proposed to implement the SIA-FTP
framework in a progressive manner, including trajectory-based FTP pretraining,
intent-oriented instruction embedding learning, and multi-modal finetuning.
Specifically, the FTP model and the instruction embedding with maneuvering
semantics are pre-trained using volumes of well-resourced trajectory and text
data in the 1st and 2nd stages. In succession, a multi-modal fusion strategy is
proposed to incorporate the pre-trained instruction embedding into the FTP
model and integrate the two pre-trained networks into a joint model. Finally,
the joint model is finetuned using the limited trajectory-instruction data to
enhance the FTP performance within maneuvering instruction scenarios. The
experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework presents an
impressive performance improvement in high-maneuvering scenarios.

and the properties of quark-matter cores in hybrid stars. The quark matter
interactions in hybrid stars are described based on 3-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model with various vector and vector-isovector coupling constants. In this
work, we find that the hybrid star matter EOS is more sensitive to the strength
of the vector interaction, and the EOS becomes stiffer with increasing vector
strength $R_V$. The vector-isovector interaction characterized by the coupling
constant $R_{IV}$ make main contribution to the hadron-quark mixed phase.
Meanwhile, we note that a step change of both the sound velocity and the
polytropic index $\gamma$ occurs in the hadron-quark phase transition, and it
is restored with the decrease of nucleon and lepton degrees of freedom in the
high density quark phase. Although the coupling constants increase the hybrid
star maximum mass up to $2.08M_{\odot}$, they also decrease the mass and radius
of the quark core and the mixed core. With different quark coupling constants,
we also find that the maximum mass and radius of the quark matter core in a
stable hybrid star can reach $0.80M_{\odot}$ and 6.95 km, which are close to
half of the maximum mass and radius of the complete star. However, properties
of quark matter have no effect on the $M = 1.4M_{\odot}$ hybrid star as a
result of no quark matter inner core, which can also be confirmed by the
criterion of the polytropic index, and thus our results also indicate that the
quark interactions have no effect on the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ of
hybrid stars.

effective light-matter coupling scales with the square root of the system size.
However, there is an additional factor that decreases with increasing doping

definition, a new synthetic dataset namely TRANCE is first constructed on the

transformation with variant views). Next, we build another real dataset called
TRANCO based on COIN, to cover the loss of transformation diversity on TRANCE.
Inspired by human reasoning, we propose a three-staged reasoning framework

recent advanced techniques perform on TVR. Experimental results show that the
state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still

is becoming ever more essential. In this transition, the energy vector hydrogen
is expected to play a key role as it can be produced from (renewable) power and
utilized in a plethora of applications and processes across sectors. To date,
however, there is no infrastructure for the production, storage, and transport
of renewable hydrogen, nor is there a demand for it on a larger scale. In order
to link production and demand sites, it is planned to re-purpose and expand the
existing European gas pipeline network in the future. During the early stages
of ramping up the hydrogen sector (2020s and early 2030s), however, blending
natural gas with hydrogen for joint pipeline transmission has been suggested.
Against this background, this paper studies hydrogen blending from a modeling
perspective, both in terms of the implications of considering (or omitting)
technical modeling details and in terms of the potential impact on the ramp-up
of the hydrogen sector. To this end, we present a highly modular and flexible
integrated sector-coupled energy system optimization model of the power,
natural gas, and hydrogen sectors with a novel gas flow formulation for
modeling blending in the context of steady-state gas flows. A stylized case
study illustrates that hydrogen blending has the potential to initiate and to
facilitate the ramp-up of the hydrogen sector, while omitting the technical
realities of gas flows -- particularly in the context of blending -- can result
in suboptimal expansion planning not only in the hydrogen, but also in the
power sector, as well as in an operationally infeasible system.

solve the problem that the gold rationales are not labeled, RE2 applies an
optimizable binary mask to each token in the sentence, and adjust the

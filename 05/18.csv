while previous methods focus on handling it via CNNs. This may inherit the
natural limitation of CNNs that fail to discriminate repetitive or incorrect
matches due to limited local receptive fields. To handle the issue, we aim to
involve Transformer into cost aggregation. However, another problem may occur
due to the quadratically growing computational complexity caused by
Transformer, resulting in memory overflow and inference latency. In this paper,
we overcome these limits with an efficient Transformer-based cost aggregation
network, namely CostFormer. The Residual Depth-Aware Cost Transformer(RDACT) is
proposed to aggregate long-range features on cost volume via self-attention
mechanisms along the depth and spatial dimensions. Furthermore, Residual
Regression Transformer(RRT) is proposed to enhance spatial attention. The
proposed method is a universal plug-in to improve learning-based MVS methods.

presence of background dissipation is studied analytically within kinetic
theory. Sufficiently near marginal stability, phase space correlations are
poorly preserved and time delays become unimportant. The system is then shown
to be governed by two first-order coupled autonomous differential equations of
cubic order for the wave amplitudes and two complementary first-order equations
for the evolution of their phases. That system of equations can be decoupled
and further simplified to a single second-order differential equation of
Li\'enard's type for each amplitude. Numerical solutions for this equation are
obtained in the general case while analytic solutions are obtained for special
cases in terms of parameters related to the spacing of the resonances of the
two waves in frequency space, e.g., wave lengths and oscillation frequencies.
These parameters are further analyzed to find classes of quasi-steady
saturation and pulsating scenarios. To classify equilibrium points, local
stability analysis is applied, and bifurcation conditions are determined. When
the two waves saturate at similar amplitude levels, their combined signal is
shown to invariably exhibit amplitude beating and phase jumps of nearly $\pi$.
The obtained analytical results can be used to benchmark simulations and to
interpret eigenmode amplitude measurements in fusion experiments.

computation consumption and memory footprint issues. Recently,
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) (e.g., Adapter, LoRA, BitFit) shows a
promising paradigm to alleviate these concerns by updating only a portion of
parameters. Despite these PEFTs having demonstrated satisfactory performance in
natural language processing, it remains under-explored for the question of
whether these techniques could be transferred to graph-based tasks with Graph
Transformer Networks (GTNs). Therefore, in this paper, we fill this gap by
providing extensive benchmarks with traditional PEFTs on a range of graph-based
downstream tasks. Our empirical study shows that it is sub-optimal to directly
transfer existing PEFTs to graph-based tasks due to the issue of feature
distribution shift. To address this issue, we propose a novel structure-aware
PEFT approach, named G-Adapter, which leverages graph convolution operation to
introduce graph structure (e.g., graph adjacent matrix) as an inductive bias to
guide the updating process. Besides, we propose Bregman proximal point
optimization to further alleviate feature distribution shift by preventing the
model from aggressive update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that G-Adapter
obtains the state-of-the-art performance compared to the counterparts on nine
graph benchmark datasets based on two pre-trained GTNs, and delivers tremendous
memory footprint efficiency compared to the conventional paradigm.

constructs an orthonormal basis from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of

subtler divisions because the interacting units are high-dimensional, like fish
schooling with varying speeds in a circle, synchrony and desynchrony may occur
to the different dimensions of the population. In this work, we show with an
ensemble of multidimensional Kuramoto oscillators, that this property is
generalizable to arbitrary dimensions: for a $d$ dimensional population, there
exist $2^d$ system modes where each dimension is either synchronized or
desynchronized, represented by a set of almost binary order parameters. Such

conventional scalar-valued coupling by capturing the inter-dimensional

explosive synchronization/desynchronization that is induced without the

understood. Here, we argue that cosmic-ray nuclear ratios, like the
boron-to-carbon ratio and relative abundances of Beryllium isotopes are
sensitive to the filling fraction of such low-diffusion zones and hence their
measurements can be used to constrain the typical sizes and ages of such
regions. We have performed a careful parameter study of a cosmic-ray transport
model that allows for different diffusion coefficients $\kappa_{\mathrm{disk}}$
and $\kappa_{\mathrm{halo}}$ in the galactic disk and halo, respectively.
Making use of preliminary data from the AMS-02 experiment on the ratio of
Beryllium isotopes, we find a $3.5 \sigma$ preference for a suppression of the
diffusion coefficient in the disk with a best-fit value of
$\kappa_{\mathrm{disk}}/\kappa_{\mathrm{halo}} = 0.20^{+0.10}_{-0.06}$. We
forecast that with upcoming data from the HELIX balloon experiment, the
significance could increase to $6.8 \sigma$. Adopting a coarse-graining
approach, we find that such a strong suppression could be realised if the
filling fraction of low-diffusion zones in the disk was $\sim 66 \, \%$. We
conclude that the impact of regions of suppressed diffusion might be larger

found that only 5.9% of connected libraries had a direct or transitive
dependency to a vulnerable library. Although we found that most libraries with
publicly reported vulnerabilities are written in C, the highest impact of
publicly reported vulnerabilities originated from libraries written in native
iOS languages. We found that around 30% of vulnerable dependencies could have
been fixed via upgrading the library dependency. In case of critical
vulnerabilities and latest library versions, over 70% of vulnerable
dependencies would have been fixed via a dependency upgrade. Lastly, we checked
whether the analysis of vulnerable dependency use could be refined using
publicly available information on the code location (method or class) of a

matter (CDM) paradigm. Due to the extremely low mass of the constituent
particle ($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV), ULDM can exhibit quantum effects up to
kiloparsec scales. In particular, runaway collapse in the centres of ULDM halos
is prevented by quantum pressure, providing a possible resolution to the
'core-cusp problem' of CDM. However, the the detailed relationship between the
ULDM core mass and that of the overall halo is poorly understood. We simulate
the collapse of both spherical and aspherical isolated ULDM overdensities using
AxioNyx, finding that the central cores of collapsed halos undergo sustained
oscillatory behaviour which affects both their peak density and overall
morphology. The variability in core morphology increases with the asphericity
of the initial overdensity and remnants of initial asphericity persist long
after collapse. Furthermore, the peak central densities are higher in spherical
configurations. Consequently, astrophysically realistic halos may exhibit
substantial departures from theoretical core-halo profiles and we would expect
a significant variance of the properties of halos with the same mass.

large vision-language models (LVLM) have been recently explored by integrating
powerful LLMs for improving the performance on complex multimodal tasks.
Despite the promising progress on LVLMs, we find that LVLMs suffer from the
hallucination problem, i.e. they tend to generate objects that are inconsistent
with the target images in the descriptions. To investigate it, this work
presents the first systematic study on object hallucination of LVLMs. We
conduct the evaluation experiments on several representative LVLMs, and show
that they mostly suffer from severe object hallucination issue. We further
discuss that the visual instructions may influence the hallucination, and find
that: objects that frequently occur in the visual instructions or co-occur with
the image objects, are obviously prone to be hallucinated by LVLMs. Besides, we
find that existing evaluation methods might be affected by the input
instructions and generation styles of LVLMs. Thus, we further design an
improved evaluation method for object hallucination by proposing a
polling-based query method called POPE. Experiment results demonstrate that our
POPE can evaluate the object hallucination in a more stable and flexible way.

giants peaks around $3~\text{au}$, the most recent high-contrast imaging
surveys have only been sensitive to planets beyond $\sim~10~\text{au}$.
Sensitivity at small angular separations from stars is currently limited by the
variability of the point spread function. We demonstrate how
moderate-resolution integral field spectrographs can detect planets at smaller
separations ($\lesssim~0.3$ arcseconds) by detecting the distinct spectral
signature of planets compared to the host star. Using OSIRIS ($R$ $\approx$
4000) at the W. M. Keck Observatory, we present the results of a planet search
via this methodology around 20 young targets in the Ophiuchus and Taurus
star-forming regions. We show that OSIRIS can outperform high-contrast
coronagraphic instruments equipped with extreme adaptive optics and
non-redundant masking in the $0.05-0.3$ arcsecond regime. As a proof of
concept, we present the $34\sigma$ detection of a high-contrast M dwarf
companion at $\approx0.1$"" with a flux ratio of $\approx0.92\%$ around the
field F2 star HD 148352. We developed an open-source Python package, breads,
for the analysis of moderate-resolution integral field spectroscopy data in
which the planet and the host star signal are jointly modeled. The diffracted
starlight continuum is forward-modeled using a spline model, which removes the
need for prior high-pass filtering or continuum normalization. The code allows
for analytic marginalization of linear hyperparameters, simplifying posterior
sampling of other parameters (e.g., radial velocity, effective temperature).
This technique could prove very powerful when applied to integral field
spectrographs like NIRSpec on the JWST and other upcoming first-light
instruments on the future Extremely Large Telescopes.

complexities for a class of relations induced by a distributed clique labelling

the relation - the traditional communication complexity of relations (CCR) and
2) the receiver has non-zero probabilities of outputting every valid answer
satisfying the relation (equivalently, the relation can be fully
reconstructed), that we denote the strong communication complexity of the
relation (S-CCR). We prove that for the specific class of relations considered
here when the players do not share any resources, there is no quantum advantage
in the CCR task for any graph. On the other hand, we show that there exist,
classes of graphs for which the separation between one-way classical and
quantum communication in the S-CCR task grow with the order of the graph,
specifically, the quantum complexity is $O(1)$ while the classical complexity
is $\Omega(\log m)$. Secondly, we prove a lower bound (that is linear in the
number of cliques) on the amount of shared randomness necessary to overcome the
separation in the scenario of fixed restricted communication and connect this
to the existence of Orthogonal Arrays. Finally, we highlight some applications
of this task to semi-device-independent dimension witnessing as well as to the

the choice of bin size significantly impacts inference results. In this work,
we present what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first continuous-time
multivariate spike train LFM for studying neuronal interactions and functional

biologically justifiable model which (1) scales linearly in the number of
simultaneously recorded neurons and (2) bypasses time binning and related
issues. Simulation studies show that parameter estimation using the proposed
model is highly accurate. Applying our LFM to experimental data from a
classical conditioning study on the prefrontal cortex in rats, we found that
coordinated neuronal activities are affected by (1) the onset of the cue for
reward delivery, and (2) the sub-region within the frontal cortex (OFC/mPFC).
These findings shed new light on our understanding of cue and outcome value

currently impeded by an insufficient picture of dislocation kinetics (the
dynamic effect of driving forces in a given dislocation theory). This is
because present methods ignore the short-range interaction of dislocations.
This work presents a kinetic theory of continuum dislocation dynamics in a
vector density framework which takes into account the short-range interactions
by means of suitably defined correlation functions. The weak line bundle
ensemble of dislocations is defined, whereby the treatment of dislocations by a
vector density is justified. It is then found by direct averaging of the
dislocation transport equation that additional driving forces arise which are
dependent on the dislocation correlation. A combination of spatial
coarse-graining and statistical averaging of discrete dislocation systems are
used to evaluate the various classes of tensorial dislocation correlations
which arise in the line bundle kinetic theory. A novel, chiral classification
of slip system interactions in FCC crystals is used to define proper and
improper rotations by which correlation functions corresponding to six
interaction classifications can be evaluated. The full set of these six
dislocation correlations are evaluated from discrete data. Only the
self-correlations (for densities of like slip system) are found to be highly
anisotropic. All six classes of correlation functions are found to decay within
2-4 times the coarse-graining distance. The correlations corresponding to the
coplanar interactions are found to be negligible. Implications of the evaluated
correlations for the implementation of vector density continuum dislocation
dynamics are discussed, especially in terms of an additional correlation
component of the driving force and a gesture toward a coarse-grained
dislocation mobility.

  (RSS), 2023",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motion planning seeks a collision-free path in a configuration space
(C-space), representing all possible robot configurations in the environment.
As it is challenging to construct a C-space explicitly for a high-dimensional
robot, we generally build a graph structure called a roadmap, a discrete
approximation of a complex continuous C-space, to reason about connectivity.
Checking collision-free connectivity in the roadmap requires expensive
edge-evaluation computations, and thus, reducing the number of evaluations has
become a significant research objective. However, in practice, we often face
infeasible problems: those in which there is no collision-free path in the
roadmap between the start and the goal locations. Existing studies often
overlook the possibility of infeasibility, becoming highly inefficient by
performing many edge evaluations.
  In this work, we address this oversight in scenarios where a prior roadmap is
available; that is, the edges of the roadmap contain the probability of being a
collision-free edge learned from past experience. To this end, we propose an
algorithm called iterative path and cut finding (IPC) that iteratively searches
for a path and a cut in a prior roadmap to detect infeasibility while reducing
expensive edge evaluations as much as possible. We further improve the
efficiency of IPC by introducing a second algorithm, iterative decomposition
and path and cut finding (IDPC), that leverages the fact that cut-finding
algorithms partition the roadmap into smaller subgraphs. We analyze the
theoretical properties of IPC and IDPC, such as completeness and computational
complexity, and evaluate their performance in terms of completion time and the
number of edge evaluations in large-scale simulations.

simultaneously exhibiting faster and more efficient inference compared to PaLM.
This improved efficiency enables broader deployment while also allowing the

pre-trained models (of various sizes), fine-tuned variants of these models, and
the user-facing products that use these models. In particular, user-facing
products typically include additional pre- and post-processing steps.
Additionally, the underlying models may evolve over time. Therefore, one should
not expect the performance of user-facing products to exactly match the results

performing tasks of diverse complexities. When facing unseen task conditions or
when new task requirements arise, robots must adapt their motion policies
accordingly. In this context, policy optimization is the \emph{de facto}
paradigm to adapt robot policies as a function of task-specific objectives.
Most commonly-used motion policies carry particular structures that are often
overlooked in policy optimization algorithms. We instead propose to leverage
the structure of probabilistic policies by casting the policy optimization as
an optimal transport problem. Specifically, we focus on robot motion policies
that build on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and formulate the policy
optimization as a Wassertein gradient flow over the GMMs space. This naturally
allows us to constrain the policy updates via the $L^2$-Wasserstein distance
between GMMs to enhance the stability of the policy optimization process.
Furthermore, we leverage the geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold to
optimize the Gaussian distributions of the GMM policy via Riemannian
optimization. We evaluate our approach on common robotic settings: Reaching
motions, collision-avoidance behaviors, and multi-goal tasks. Our results show
that our method outperforms common policy optimization baselines in terms of
task success rate and low-variance solutions.

additionally model the emission spectra for bare-rock planets of various

eclipse depth to within 1$\sigma$, and the best-fit grey albedo is $0.02 \pm
0.11$. We conclude that planned secondary eclipse observations at 12.8 $\mu$m

for establishing minimax bounds that shed light on the statistical cost of

\alpha_d$ of the $d$ components. We demonstrate the versatility and efficiency
of these techniques by presenting various statistical applications.
Specifically, we examine nonparametric density and covariance estimation under
CLDP, providing upper and lower bounds that match up to constant factors, as

the probability of extracting sensitive information from one component by
exploiting the fact that, on another component which may be correlated with the

sources detected without EM counterparts (dark sirens), it is becoming crucial
to have statistical techniques able to perform cosmological studies in the
absence of EM emission. Currently, only two techniques for dark sirens are used
on GW observations: the spectral siren method, which is based on the
source-frame mass distribution to estimate conjointly cosmology and the
source's merger rate, and the galaxy survey method, which uses galaxy surveys
to assign a probabilistic redshift to the source while fitting cosmology. It

that the Fisher metric defines a correlation length that plays the role of an
emergent RG scale quantifying the distinguishability between nearby points in
the space of probability distributions. This RG scale can be interpreted as a
proxy for the maximum number of unique observations that can be made about a
given system during a statistical inference experiment. The role of the
Bayesian Renormalization scheme is subsequently to prepare an effective model
for a given system up to a precision which is bounded by the aforementioned
scale. In applications of Bayesian Renormalization to physical systems, the
emergent information theoretic scale is naturally identified with the maximum
energy that can be probed by current experimental apparatus, and thus Bayesian
Renormalization coincides with ordinary renormalization. However, Bayesian
Renormalization is sufficiently general to apply even in circumstances in which
an immediate physical scale is absent, and thus provides an ideal approach to
renormalization in data science contexts. To this end, we provide insight into
how the Bayesian Renormalization scheme relates to existing methods for data
compression and data generation such as the information bottleneck and the

insights into the model reasoning process of making predictions. The more
faithful a FA is, the more accurately it reflects which parts of the input are
more important for the prediction. Widely used faithfulness metrics, such as
sufficiency and comprehensiveness use a hard erasure criterion, i.e. entirely
removing or retaining the top most important tokens ranked by a given FA and
observing the changes in predictive likelihood. However, this hard criterion
ignores the importance of each individual token, treating them all equally for
computing sufficiency and comprehensiveness. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective soft erasure criterion. Instead of entirely removing or retaining
tokens from the input, we randomly mask parts of the token vector
representations proportionately to their FA importance. Extensive experiments
across various natural language processing tasks and different FAs show that
our soft-sufficiency and soft-comprehensiveness metrics consistently prefer
more faithful explanations compared to hard sufficiency and comprehensiveness.

modeling relational data. However, while many real-world graphs are directed,
the majority of today's GNN models discard this information altogether by
simply making the graph undirected. The reasons for this are historical: 1)
many early variants of spectral GNNs explicitly required undirected graphs, and
2) the first benchmarks on homophilic graphs did not find significant gain from
using direction. In this paper, we show that in heterophilic settings, treating
the graph as directed increases the effective homophily of the graph,
suggesting a potential gain from the correct use of directionality information.
To this end, we introduce Directed Graph Neural Network (Dir-GNN), a novel
general framework for deep learning on directed graphs. Dir-GNN can be used to
extend any Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to account for edge
directionality information by performing separate aggregations of the incoming
and outgoing edges. We prove that Dir-GNN matches the expressivity of the
Directed Weisfeiler-Lehman test, exceeding that of conventional MPNNs. In
extensive experiments, we validate that while our framework leaves performance
unchanged on homophilic datasets, it leads to large gains over base models such
as GCN, GAT and GraphSage on heterophilic benchmarks, outperforming much more
complex methods and achieving new state-of-the-art results.

led to increased interest in 3D scene editing. One important task in editing is
removing objects from a scene while ensuring visual reasonability and multiview
consistency. However, current methods face challenges such as time-consuming
object labelling, limited capability to remove specific targets, and
compromised rendering quality after removal. This paper proposes a novel
object-removing pipeline, named OR-NeRF, that can remove objects from 3D scenes
with either point or text prompts on a single view, achieving better
performance in less time than previous works. Our method uses a points
projection strategy to rapidly spread user annotations to all views,
significantly reducing the processing burden. This algorithm allows us to
leverage the recent 2D segmentation model Segment-Anything (SAM) to predict
masks with improved precision and efficiency. Additionally, we obtain colour
and depth priors through 2D inpainting methods. Finally, our algorithm employs
depth supervision and perceptual loss for scene reconstruction to maintain
consistency in geometry and appearance after object removal. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves better editing quality with less
time than previous works, considering both quality and quantity.

inversion of the bulk gap accompanied by helical states near zero displacement

Using superconducting quantum interferometry we observe an even-odd effect in
the Fraunhofer interference pattern within the inverted gap phase. We show
theoretically that this effect is a direct consequence of the emergence of
helical modes that connect the two edges of the sample. The absence of such an

junctions, confirms this interpretation and demonstrates the topological nature
of the inverted gap. Our results demonstrate the coupling of superconductivity

We study both asymptotic and non-asymptotic properties of these estimators in

correlated, the existing results on lasso are not applicable. We show that when
the system is stable and the attacks are injected periodically, the sample
complexity for the exact recovery of the system dynamics is O(n), where n is
the dimension of the states. When the adversarial attacks occur at each time
instance with probability p, the required sample complexity for the exact
recovery scales as O(\log(n)p/(1-p)^2). This result implies the almost sure
convergence to the true system dynamics under the asymptotic regime. As a
by-product, even when more than half of the data is compromised, our estimators
still learn the system correctly. This paper provides the first mathematical
guarantee in the literature on learning from correlated data for dynamical

the key theme of how dynamics on networks relate to their structure more
generally. We present an analytic technique to directly measure the relative
synchronizability of noise-driven time-series processes on networks, in terms
of the directed network structure. We consider both discrete-time
auto-regressive processes and continuous-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics on
networks. Our technique builds on computation of the network covariance matrix
in the space orthogonal to the synchronized state, enabling it to be more
general than previous work in not requiring either symmetric (undirected) or
diagonalizable connectivity matrices, and allowing arbitrary self-link weights.
More importantly, our approach quantifies the relative synchronisation
specifically in terms of the contribution of process motif (walk) structures.
We demonstrate that in general the relative abundance of process motifs with
convergent directed walks (including feedback and feedforward loops) hinders
synchronizability. We also reveal subtle differences between the motifs
involved for discrete or continuous-time dynamics. Our insights analytically
explain several known general results regarding synchronizability of networks,

accuracy in translating between English and languages that exclusively use
gender-neutral pronouns. We center this study around Bengali, the 7$^{th}$ most
spoken language globally, but also generalize our findings across five other
languages: Farsi, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, and Turkish. We find that ChatGPT
perpetuates gender defaults and stereotypes assigned to certain occupations
(e.g. man = doctor, woman = nurse) or actions (e.g. woman = cook, man = go to
work), as it converts gender-neutral pronouns in languages to `he' or `she'. We
also observe ChatGPT completely failing to translate the English gender-neutral
pronoun `they' into equivalent gender-neutral pronouns in other languages, as
it produces translations that are incoherent and incorrect. While it does
respect and provide appropriately gender-marked versions of Bengali words when
prompted with gender information in English, ChatGPT appears to confer a higher
respect to men than to women in the same occupation. We conclude that ChatGPT
exhibits the same gender biases which have been demonstrated for tools like
Google Translate or MS Translator, as we provide recommendations for a human

  (LHCb public pages)",,,"LHCb-DP-2022-002","hep-ex physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The LHCb upgrade represents a major change of the experiment. The detectors
have been almost completely renewed to allow running at an instantaneous
luminosity five times larger than that of the previous running periods. Readout
of all detectors into an all-software trigger is central to the new design,
facilitating the reconstruction of events at the maximum LHC interaction rate,
and their selection in real time. The experiment's tracking system has been
completely upgraded with a new pixel vertex detector, a silicon tracker
upstream of the dipole magnet and three scintillating fibre tracking stations
downstream of the magnet. The whole photon detection system of the RICH
detectors has been renewed and the readout electronics of the calorimeter and
muon systems have been fully overhauled. The first stage of the all-software
trigger is implemented on a GPU farm. The output of the trigger provides a
combination of totally reconstructed physics objects, such as tracks and
vertices, ready for final analysis, and of entire events which need further
offline reprocessing. This scheme required a complete revision of the computing
model and rewriting of the experiment's software.

  Field","Accepted to PASP",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present the results of deep, ground based U-band imaging with the Large
Binocular Telescope of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field as part of
the near-UV imaging program, UVCANDELS. We utilize a seeing sorted stacking
method along with night-to-night relative transparency corrections to create
optimal depth and optimal resolution mosaics in the U-band, which are capable
of reaching point source magnitudes of AB 26.5 mag at 3 sigma. These ground
based mosaics bridge the wavelength gap between the HST WFC3 F27W and ACS F435W
images and are necessary to understand galaxy assembly in the last 9-10 Gyr. We
use the depth of these mosaics to search for the presence of U-band intragroup
light (IGrL) beyond the local Universe. Regardless of how groups are scaled and
stacked, we do not detect any U-band IGrL to unprecedented U-band depths of
29.1-29.6 mag/arcsec2, which corresponds to an IGrL fraction of less than 1% of
the total group light. This stringent upper limit suggests that IGrL does not
contribute significantly to the Extragalactic Background Light at short
wavelengths. Furthermore, the lack of UV IGrL observed in these stacks suggests
that the atomic gas observed in the intragroup medium (IGrM) is likely not
dense enough to trigger star formation on large scales. Future studies may
detect IGrL by creating similar stacks at longer wavelengths or by
pre-selecting groups which are older and/or more dynamically evolved similar to

embeddings of entities and relations in knowledge graphs. These embedding
methods require that all test entities are observed at training time, resulting
in a time-consuming retraining process for out-of-knowledge-graph (OOKG)
entities. To address this issue, current inductive knowledge embedding methods
employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent unseen entities by aggregating
information of known neighbors. They face three important challenges: (i) data
sparsity, (ii) the presence of complex patterns in knowledge graphs (e.g.,
inter-rule correlations), and (iii) the presence of interactions among rule
mining, rule inference, and embedding. In this paper, we propose a virtual
neighbor network with inter-rule correlations (VNC) that consists of three
stages: (i) rule mining, (ii) rule inference, and (iii) embedding. In the rule
mining process, to identify complex patterns in knowledge graphs, both logic
rules and inter-rule correlations are extracted from knowledge graphs based on
operations over relation embeddings. To reduce data sparsity, virtual neighbors
for OOKG entities are predicted and assigned soft labels by optimizing a
rule-constrained problem. We also devise an iterative framework to capture the
underlying relations between rule learning and embedding learning. In our
experiments, results on both link prediction and triple classification tasks
show that the proposed VNC framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on
four widely-used knowledge graphs. Further analysis reveals that VNC is robust
to the proportion of unseen entities and effectively mitigates data sparsity.

provided by an efficient spectral interpolation of the first-order
gravitational self-force in the outgoing radiation gauge. In order to speed up
the calculation of the inspiral we apply a near-identity (averaging)
transformation to eliminate all dependence of the orbital phases from the
equations of motion while maintaining all secular effects of the first-order
gravitational self-force at post-adiabatic order. The resulting solutions are
defined with respect to `Mino time' so we perform a second averaging
transformation so the inspiral is parametrized in terms of Boyer-Lindquist
time, which is more convenient of LISA data analysis. We also perform a similar
analysis using the two-timescale expansion and find that using either approach
yields self-forced inspirals that can be evolved to sub-radian accuracy in less
than a second. The dominant contribution to the inspiral phase comes from the
adiabatic contributions and so we further refine our self-force model using
information from gravitational wave flux calculations. The significant
dephasing we observe between the lower and higher accuracy models highlights

demonstrate, in the context of a table clearing application, that RAMP can
rapidly find paths in the robot's configuration space, satisfy task and
robot-specific constraints, and provide safety by reacting to static or
dynamically moving obstacles. RAMP achieves superior performance through a
number of key innovations: we use Signed Distance Function (SDF)
representations directly from the robot configuration space, both for collision
checking and reactive control. The use of SDFs allows for a smoother definition
of collision cost when planning for a trajectory, and is critical in ensuring
safety while following trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel variant

trajectory follower, performs incremental real-time global trajectory planning.
Simulation results establish that our method can generate paths that are

any prediction error and guarantees the best-known worst-case bound even when
the predictions are entirely erroneous. We also consider a stochastic error
model and bound the performance in terms of the expectation and variance of the

new theoretical results which bound this gap and show the dependence on the
decoder complexity, in terms of code parameters (blocklength, message length,
variable/check node degrees), decoding iterations, and the training dataset

However, there may be a lack of theoretical models for the generation of FC. In
this work, we present a straightforward decomposition of FC into a set of basis
states of sine waves with an additional jitter component. We show that the
decomposition matches the predictive ability of FC after including 5-10 bases.
We also find that both the decomposition and its residual have approximately
equal predictive value, and when combined into an ensemble, exceed the AUC of
FC-based prediction by up to 5%. Additionally, we find the residual can be used
for subject fingerprinting, with 97.3% same-subject, different-scan
identifiability, compared to 62.5% for FC. Unlike PCA or Factor Analysis
methods, our method does not require knowledge of a population to perform its
decomposition; a single subject is enough. Our decomposition of FC into two
equally-predictive components may lead to a novel appreciation of group
differences in patient populations. Additionally, we generate synthetic patient
FC based on user-specified characteristics such as age, sex, and disease
diagnosis. By creating synthetic datasets or augmentations we may reduce the
high financial burden associated with fMRI data acquisition.

these two industries. For a sustainable world, the circular economy is the key;
thus, the waste produced must be upcycled/recycled/reused to complete the
circular chain. Herein, we show that an upcycled/recycled Si can be used with
carbon as a composite anode material, with high Si content (~40 wt.%) and
loading of 3-4 mAh/cm^2 for practical use in lithium-ion batteries. The unique
spherical jackfruit-like structure of the Si-C composite can minimize the total
lithium inventory loss compared to the conventional Si-C composite and pure Si,
resulting in superior electrochemical performance. The superior electrochemical

we present a novel CM model, Asymmetric Mixed-Modal Moderation (AM3), to target

previous works that focus on fusing the two modalities while overlooking the
intrinsic difference between the information conveyed in multimodality and in
unimodality (asymmetry in modalities), we propose a novel cross-modality

apply to the image as a whole. Recent MIL models are able to capture
correspondences between patches by employing self-attention, allowing them to
weigh each patch differently based on all other patches in the bag. However,
these approaches still do not consider the relative spatial relationships

to the single particle cyclotron transition. In this work, we point out that
strong light-matter hybridization between the Kohn mode and the cavity photons
gives rise to collective hybrid modes between the Landau levels and the
photons. We provide the exact solution for the collective Landau polaritons and
we demonstrate the weakening of topological protection at zero temperature due
to the existence of the lower polariton mode which is softer than the Kohn

hourly short-term load forecasting across different time horizons (day-ahead

the TFT architecture does not offer higher predictive performance than a
state-of-the-art LSTM model for day-ahead forecasting on the entire grid.
However, the results display significant improvements for the TFT when applied
at the substation level with a subsequent aggregation to the upper grid-level,
resulting in a prediction error of 2.43% (MAPE) for the best-performing
scenario. In addition, the TFT appears to offer remarkable improvements over
the LSTM approach for week-ahead forecasting (yielding a predictive error of
2.52% (MAPE) at the lowest). We outline avenues for future research using the
TFT approach for load forecasting, including the exploration of various grid

There is a gap in literature between the theoretical analysis of negative

negative triples. In this paper, we modify the InfoNCE loss to explicitly
account for the negative sample distribution. We show minimizing InfoNCE loss

inputs that they are unsure about. These classifiers are becoming increasingly
popular in high-stake decision-making problems, as they can withhold uncertain

abstaining classifier(s), however, we lack a principled approach that accounts
for what the classifier would have predicted on its abstentions. These missing
predictions are crucial when, e.g., a radiologist is unsure of their diagnosis
or when a driver is inattentive in a self-driving car. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach and perspective to the problem of evaluating and
comparing abstaining classifiers by treating abstentions as missing data. Our
evaluation approach is centered around defining the counterfactual score of an
abstaining classifier, defined as the expected performance of the classifier
had it not been allowed to abstain. We specify the conditions under which the
counterfactual score is identifiable: if the abstentions are stochastic, and if
the evaluation data is independent of the training data (ensuring that the
predictions are missing at random), then the score is identifiable. Note that,
if abstentions are deterministic, then the score is unidentifiable because the
classifier can perform arbitrarily poorly on its abstentions. Leveraging tools
from observational causal inference, we then develop nonparametric and doubly
robust methods to efficiently estimate this quantity under identification. Our
approach is examined in both simulated and real data experiments.

playground to study non-trivial multiparticle physics, offering the possibility
to test some general mechanisms with very large-scale exact diagonalization

through the lens of extreme value theory, focusing on the extreme polarizations
of the equivalent spin chain model in a random magnetic field. A
many-body-induced chain breaking mechanism is explored numerically, and
compared to an analytically solvable toy model. A unified description, from
weak to large disorder strengths $W$ emerges, where the disorder-dependent
average localization length $\xi(W)$ governs the extreme events leading to
chain breaks. In particular, tails of the local magnetization distributions are
controlled by $\xi(W)$. Remarkably, we also obtain a quantitative understanding
of the full distribution of the extreme polarizations, which is given by a
Fr\'echet-type law. In a second part, we explore finite interaction physics and
the MBL question. For the available system sizes, we numerically quantify the
difference in the extreme value distributions between the interacting problem

differences in periods of non-radial oscillations (period spacings),
respectively. In core helium burning giants with masses below about 1.7 solar
masses, i.e. stars that have gone through a helium flash, the asymptotic period
spacings take values of about 220 -350 s at frequency of maximum oscillation

lower than about 200 s at similar frequencies separations has recently been

theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive

the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM

these challenges by developing an error correction method for large-scale

method can distinguish correlated particle-hole pairs from uncorrelated holes

dramatic improvement in the non-local parity correlator and find the perimeter

partition $P$ is an independent set of vertices of $G$ (i.e. it induces no
edges), that consists of one vertex from each part (\emph{block}) of $P$. Over
the years, various criteria have been established that guarantee the existence
of an IT, often given in terms of $P$ being $t$-\emph{thick}, meaning all
blocks have size at least $t$. One such result, obtained recently by Wanless

$b(G,P)=\max\{\sum_{u\in U} d(u)/|U| : U \in P\}$. They proved that if
$b(G,P)\leq t/4$ then an IT exists. Resolving a problem posed by Groenland,
Kaiser, Treffers and Wales (who showed that the ratio $1/4$ is best possible),
here we give a full characterization of pairs $(\alpha,\beta)$ such that the
following holds for every $t>0$: whenever $G$ is a graph with maximum degree
$\Delta(G)\leq\alpha t$, and $P$ is a $t$-thick vertex partition of $G$ such
that $b(G,P)\leq \beta t$, there exists an IT of $G$ with respect to $P$. Our
proof makes use of another previously known criterion for the existence of IT's
that involves the topological connectedness of the independence complex of
graphs, and establishes a general technical theorem on the structure of graphs
for which this parameter is bounded above by a known quantity. Our result
interpolates between the criterion $b(G,P)\leq t/4$ and the old and frequently
applied theorem that if $\Delta(G)\leq t/2$ then an IT exists. Using the same

sets $B$. As a corollary we obtain the corresponding pointwise convergence
result on $L^1$. This contributes yet another counterexample for the conjecture
of Rosenblatt and Wierdl from 1991 asserting the failure of pointwise
convergence on $L^1$ of ergodic averages along arithmetic sets with zero Banach

in the spirit of Dunford and Zygmund along $B$ on $L^p$, $p>1$, which is
derived by establishing uniform oscillation estimates and certain vector-valued

aggregation across multiple devices in federated edge learning (FEEL). In
addition to the analog schemes, one-bit digital aggregation (OBDA) scheme was
proposed to adapt OAC to modern digital wireless systems. However, one-bit
quantization in OBDA can result in a serious information loss and slower
convergence of FEEL. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes an
unsourced massive access (UMA)-based generalized digital OAC (GD-OAC) scheme.
Specifically, at the transmitter, all the devices share the same non-orthogonal
UMA codebook for uplink transmission. The local model update of each device is
quantized based on the same quantization codebook. Then, each device transmits
a sequence selected from the UMA codebook based on the quantized elements of
its model update. At the receiver, we propose an approximate message
passing-based algorithm for efficient UMA detection and model aggregation.
Simulation results show that the proposed GD-OAC scheme significantly
accelerates the FEEL convergences compared with the state-of-the-art OBDA
scheme while using the same uplink communication resources.

highly frequent words. Although this problem has been noted in prior work, no
solution has been proposed thus far. We observe that the L2 norm of
contextualised embeddings of a word correlates with its log-frequency in the

highly frequent words reduce the cosine similarity values measured between
them, thus underestimating the similarity scores. To solve this issue, we
propose a method to discount the L2 norm of a contextualised word embedding by
the frequency of that word in a corpus when measuring the cosine similarities

the rest of the words, which require special consideration during their
discounting process. Experimental results on a contextualised word similarity

capturing structural and temporal information. For our experiments, we present
a framework that converts relevant historical facts into prompts and generates
ranked predictions using token probabilities. Surprisingly, we observe that
LLMs, out-of-the-box, perform on par with state-of-the-art TKG models carefully

performances across several models and datasets with different characteristics,
compares alternative heuristics for preparing contextual information, and
contrasts to prominent TKG methods and simple frequency and recency baselines.
We also discover that using numerical indices instead of entity/relation names,
i.e., hiding semantic information, does not significantly affect the
performance ($\pm$0.4\% Hit@1). This shows that prior semantic knowledge is
unnecessary; instead, LLMs can leverage the existing patterns in the context to
achieve such performance. Our analysis also reveals that ICL enables LLMs to
learn irregular patterns from the historical context, going beyond simple
predictions based on common or recent information.

This decomposition allows the definition of probability distributions that
ablate the contribution of specific input tokens, which can be used to analyze

as a measure of importance, this work first examines which context words make
the biggest contribution to language model predictions. Regression experiments
suggest that Transformer-based language models rely primarily on collocational
associations, followed by linguistic factors such as syntactic dependencies and
coreference relationships in making next-word predictions. Additionally,
analyses using these measures to predict syntactic dependencies and coreferent
mention spans show that collocational association and repetitions of the same

benefits, TSoR designs a high-performance network stack that efficiently
transfers TCP traffic using RDMA network. Thus, TSoR provides a turn-key

network with minimal effort.
  Our evaluation results show that TSoR provides up to 2.3x higher throughput

stability problem by studying how the predictions of a model change, even when
it is retrained on the same data, as a consequence of stochasticity in the

instability in predictions for a significant fraction of queries. We formulate
principled metrics, like per-sample ``label entropy'' across training runs or
within a single training run, to quantify this phenomenon. Intriguingly, we
find that unstable predictions do not appear at random, but rather appear to be
clustered in data-specific ways. We study data-agnostic regularization methods
to improve stability and propose new data-centric methods that exploit our
local stability estimates. We find that our localized data-specific mitigation
strategy dramatically outperforms data-agnostic methods, and comes within 90%

  Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While large language models (LMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
numerous tasks, they often struggle with simple reasoning and planning in
physical environments, such as understanding object permanence or planning
household activities. The limitation arises from the fact that LMs are trained
only on written text and miss essential embodied knowledge and skills. In this
paper, we propose a new paradigm of enhancing LMs by finetuning them with world
models, to gain diverse embodied knowledge while retaining their general
language capabilities. Our approach deploys an embodied agent in a world model,
particularly a simulator of the physical world (VirtualHome), and acquires a
diverse set of embodied experiences through both goal-oriented planning and
random exploration. These experiences are then used to finetune LMs to teach
diverse abilities of reasoning and acting in the physical world, e.g., planning
and completing goals, object permanence and tracking, etc. Moreover, it is
desirable to preserve the generality of LMs during finetuning, which
facilitates generalizing the embodied knowledge across tasks rather than being
tied to specific simulations. We thus further introduce the classical elastic
weight consolidation (EWC) for selective weight updates, combined with low-rank
adapters (LoRA) for training efficiency. Extensive experiments show our
approach substantially improves base LMs on 18 downstream tasks by 64.28% on
average. In particular, the small LMs (1.3B and 6B) enhanced by our approach
match or even outperform much larger LMs (e.g., ChatGPT).

using these codes can be very expensive as they are designed to follow a

the power-law component polarization to be 6.8-7.0% and note that the

including biomedical imaging, high-rate communication, and radar detection.
Existing terahertz phase shifters typically rely on tuning the resonant effect
of metamaterial structures to achieve a narrow bandwidth phase shift. However,
the terahertz band offers a wide bandwidth resource, which has great advantages
in high longitudinal resolution detection, high-capacity communication,
spectral imaging and so on. Here, we propose and demonstrate an ultrawideband
terahertz phase shifting mechanism that utilizes an optical conductivity
tuneable interface combined with a non-resonant metasurface operating in the
total internal reflection geometry. This approach effectively modulates the
phase of the reflected terahertz signal in an ultrawideband. To implement this
mechanism, we designed a structure consisting of graphene-loaded non-resonant
periodic metal microslits arranged in the total internal reflection geometry.
By controlling the gate voltage of the graphene within a range of 5 V, an
averaged ~120{\deg} continuous phase shift in the frequency range of 0.4 to 1.2
THz was achieved. Notably, in the frequency range of 1 to 1.2 THz, the phase
modulation exhibited a linear relationship with the driving voltage. Our device
demonstrated minimal fluctuations in the reflected amplitude, with a deviation
of less than 1 dB and an insertion loss of less than 10 dB. Additionally, the
modulation speed of this solid-state device reached the kHz level. Remarkably,
the phase modulation bandwidth ({\Delta}f/f) achieved approximately 100% of the
arithmetic centre frequency at 0.8 THz, surpassing the definition of
ultrawideband, which typically encompasses 20% of the centre frequency. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first and most wideband phase shifter
developed for the terahertz regime to date.

to achieve electro-optic modulation of sub-wavelength device scales, when thin
ITO films are interfaced with optical light confinement techniques such as

strong light-matter-interactions. Here we review efforts towards utilizing this
novel material for high-performance and ultra-compact modulation. While high
performance metrics are achieved experimentally, there are open questions
pertaining the permittivity modulation mechanism of ITO. Furthermore, we show
that a footprint-saving waveguide inline cavity can enhance obtainable

methods train deep neural networks on collected shadow & shadow-free image
pairs, which are desired to complete two distinct tasks via shared weights,
i.e., data restoration for shadow regions and identical mapping for non-shadow

shared weights for these two tasks could lead to the model being optimized
towards only one task instead of both during the training process. Note that
such a key issue is not identified by existing deep learning-based shadow
removal methods. To address this problem, we propose to handle these two tasks
separately and leverage the identical mapping results to guide the shadow
restoration in an iterative manner. Specifically, our method consists of three
components: an identical mapping branch (IMB) for non-shadow regions
processing, an iterative de-shadow branch (IDB) for shadow regions restoration
based on identical results, and a smart aggregation block (SAB). The IMB aims
to reconstruct an image that is identical to the input one, which can benefit
the restoration of the non-shadow regions without explicitly distinguishing
between shadow and non-shadow regions. Utilizing the multi-scale features
extracted by the IMB, the IDB can effectively transfer information from
non-shadow regions to shadow regions progressively, facilitating the process of
shadow removal. The SAB is designed to adaptive integrate features from both
IMB and IDB. Moreover, it generates a finely tuned soft shadow mask that guides
the process of removing shadows. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method

For

methods have addressed this problem by reducing classifier bias provided that
the features obtained with long-tailed data are representative enough. However,
we find that training directly on long-tailed data leads to uneven embedding

tail classes, which is not conducive to subsequent classifier learning.
%further improving model performance. This paper therefore studies the problem
of long-tailed visual recognition from the perspective of feature level. We
introduce feature augmentation to balance the embedding distribution. The

proposed to improve model performance at a modest computational overhead.
Subsequently, the distorted embedding spaces of all classes can be calibrated.
In such balanced-distributed embedding spaces, the biased classifier can be

Concretely, we demonstrate experimentally that in speech separation, different

implement a self-supervised learning to learn to minimize the distance between

coupling between the microwave field and magnon Kittle modes in current

of magnonic nonclassical states is impossible, unless other subsystems e.g.
phonons, squeezed photons or superconducting qubits are incorporated. In this
paper, we consider two-tone modulated cavity electromagnonics to keep the
nontrivial anti-rotating terms and obtain tunable phase factors, resulting in
an effective Hamiltonian exactly the same as that of generic linearized cavity
optomechanics. This can therefore be exploited to directly prepare macroscopic

for volumetric medical image annotation, that allows automatic and

into a single deep learning model. It allows easy integration of
uncertainty-based ranking strategies (i.e. aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty

training DeepEdit by using standard training combined with user interaction
simulation. Once trained, DeepEdit allows clinicians to quickly segment their
datasets by using the algorithm in auto segmentation mode or by providing
clicks via a user interface (i.e. 3D Slicer, OHIF). We show the value of
DeepEdit through evaluation on the PROSTATEx dataset for prostate/prostatic

generative tasks. However, the iterative denoising process is expensive in
computations at inference time, making diffusion models less practical for
low-latency and scalable real-world applications. Post-training quantization of
diffusion models can significantly reduce the model size and accelerate the
sampling process without requiring any re-training. Nonetheless, applying
existing post-training quantization methods directly to low-bit diffusion
models can significantly impair the quality of generated samples. Specifically,
for each denoising step, quantization noise leads to deviations in the
estimated mean and mismatches with the predetermined variance schedule.
Moreover, as the sampling process proceeds, the quantization noise may
accumulate, resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in late denoising
steps. To address these challenges, we propose a unified formulation for the
quantization noise and diffusion perturbed noise in the quantized denoising
process. We first disentangle the quantization noise into its correlated and
residual uncorrelated parts regarding its full-precision counterpart. The
correlated part can be easily corrected by estimating the correlation
coefficient. For the uncorrelated part, we calibrate the denoising variance
schedule to absorb the excess variance resulting from quantization. Moreover,
we propose a mixed-precision scheme to choose the optimal bitwidth for each
denoising step, which prefers low bits to accelerate the early denoising steps
while high bits maintain the high SNR for the late steps. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous post-training quantized

infinite width scaling limit of a Bayesian neural network with one hidden layer
is a Gaussian process, \emph{when the network weights have bounded prior
variance}. Neal's result has been extended to networks with multiple hidden
layers and to convolutional neural networks, also with Gaussian process scaling
limits. The tractable properties of Gaussian processes then allow
straightforward posterior inference and uncertainty quantification,
considerably simplifying the study of the limit process compared to a network
of finite width. Neural network weights with unbounded variance, however, pose
unique challenges. In this case, the classical central limit theorem breaks
down and it is well known that the scaling limit is an $\alpha$-stable process
under suitable conditions. However, current literature is primarily limited to
forward simulations under these processes and the problem of posterior
inference under such a scaling limit remains largely unaddressed, unlike in the
Gaussian process case. To this end, our contribution is an interpretable and
computationally efficient procedure for posterior inference, using a
\emph{conditionally Gaussian} representation, that then allows full use of the
Gaussian process machinery for tractable posterior inference and uncertainty
quantification in the non-Gaussian regime.

a complicated data collection pipeline with time-consuming manual annotation to

imaginary part of the quark-antiquark potential, in contrast to the
string-breaking phenomena in the static limit. It is also shown that the
elimination of the different degrees of freedom induces the nonlocality and
energy dependence of the effective potentials. For the obtained nonlocal
potentials, we apply two methods of the local approximation proposed
previously, the formal derivative expansion and the derivative expansion in the
HAL QCD method, by carefully examining the energy dependence of the potential.
As an application, we construct a coupled-channel model of $c\bar{c}$ and
$D^{0}\bar{D}^{*0}$ to describe $X(3872)$, and discuss the property of the
effective $D^{0}\bar{D}^{*0}$ potentials. We confirm that the local
approximation by the HAL QCD method works better than the formal derivative
expansion also for the energy-dependent potential. At the same time, we show
that, in the HAL QCD method, the resulting phase shift is sensitive to the
choice of the wavefunction to construct the local potential when the system has
a shallow bound state such as $X(3872)$.

a fine-grained analysis of bias in GBDT and demonstrate that the bias

2) the bias in the split finding algorithm resulting from the use of the same

periodically aggregating local Q-estimates trained on local data alone.
Focusing on infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision processes, we provide
sample complexity guarantees for both the synchronous and asynchronous variants
of federated Q-learning. In both cases, our bounds exhibit a linear speedup
with respect to the number of agents and sharper dependencies on other salient
problem parameters. Moreover, existing approaches to federated Q-learning adopt
an equally-weighted averaging of local Q-estimates, which can be highly
sub-optimal in the asynchronous setting since the local trajectories can be
highly heterogeneous due to different local behavior policies. Existing sample
complexity scales inverse proportionally to the minimum entry of the stationary
state-action occupancy distributions over all agents, requiring that every
agent covers the entire state-action space. Instead, we propose a novel
importance averaging algorithm, giving larger weights to more frequently

attributed to the appearance of the travelling-wave-like alternating positive
and negative structures. Moreover, the intensities of the entropy and the
entropic modes of density and temperature become stronger near the wall as the
wall temperature decreases, due to the appearance of the streaky entropic
structures. The streaky entropic structures are mainly caused by the advection
effect of the strong positive wall-normal gradient of the mean temperature
associated with ejection and sweep events. {It is also found that the profiles
of the intensities of the entropy, density and temperature are similar to each
other far from the wall, which are mainly due to the reason that the entropic
modes are dominant in the fluctuating density and temperature in the far-wall
region. The acoustic modes of density and temperature only have significant
contributions in the near-wall region.

breaking of rotational symmetry associated with the bond lengths reveals
modulations around four-unit-cell periodicity in both B1 and E representations
in the C4v group of the lattice, which coincides with the uni-directional
d-symmetry CDW (dCDW) previously identified within the CuO2 planes, thus
providing direct evidence of electron-lattice coupling in the pseudogap state

results suggest that the periodic lattice displacements in E representations

two challenges: first, to holographic duality (the boundary matter tends to

collapse too quickly for traversal to be possible). As is well known, the first

temperature (at any value, so the black hole is \emph{not} near-extremal). We
show that the dual phenomenon, a dramatic slowing of the black hole interior

sufficiently slow complexification of the field theories dual to rotating black

coupled with fine-grained model recombination, FedMR can converge to a
well-generalized global model for all the clients, leading to a superior

Southern Survey as the most luminous quasar in the last $\sim 9\,\rm Gyr$. In
this paper, we report on the eROSITA/Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observations
of the source from the eROSITA All Sky Survey, along with presenting results
from recent monitoring performed using Swift, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR. The
source shows a clear variability by factors of $\sim 10$ and $\sim 2.7$ over
timescales of a year and of a few days, respectively. When fit with an absorbed
power law plus high-energy cutoff, the X-ray spectra reveal a $\Gamma=2.2 \pm
0.2$ and $E_{\rm cut}=23^{+26}_{-5}\,\rm keV$. Assuming Comptonisation, we
estimate a coronal optical depth and electron temperature of $\tau=2.5-5.3\,
(5.2-8)$ and $kT=8-18\, (7.5-14)\,\rm keV$, respectively, for a slab
(spherical) geometry. The broadband SED is successfully modelled by assuming
either a standard accretion disc illuminated by a central X-ray source, or a
thin disc with a slim disc emissivity profile. The former model results in a
black hole mass estimate of the order of $10^{10}\,M_\odot$, slightly higher
than prior optical estimates; meanwhile, the latter model suggests a lower
mass. Both models suggest sub-Eddington accretion when assuming a spinning
black hole, and a compact ($\sim 10\,r_{\rm g}$) X-ray corona. The measured
intrinsic column density and the Eddington ratio strongly suggest the presence
of an outflow driven by radiation pressure. This is also supported by variation
of absorption by an order of magnitude over the period of $\sim 900\,\rm days$.

in S_1 and S_2. We demonstrate that this is polynomial-time solvable if S_1 and
S_2 have constant numbers of polyominoes, and it is strongly NP-complete in
general. The second puzzle allows us to make copies of the pieces in S_1 and
S_2. That is, a polyomino in S_1 can be used multiple times to form a shape.
This is a generalized version of the classical puzzle known as the common
multiple shape puzzle. For two polyominoes P and Q, the common multiple shape
is a shape that can be formed by many copies of P and many copies of Q. We show
that the second puzzle is undecidable in general. The undecidability is
demonstrated by a reduction from a new type of undecidable puzzle based on

the rapidity and transverse momentum distribution of the $\Upsilon$ (1S) and

quarks scatter elastically with partons from the quark gluon plasma (QGP). The
elastic scattering of heavy (anti)quark in QGP is realized by the dynamical
quasi-particle model (DQPM) and the expanding QGP is modeled by PHSD. We find
that a reduction to 20 \% of the scattering cross section for a (anti)bottom

due to color neutrality the scattering cross section of the small $b\bar{b}$

threshold in the $\pi^{+}\Xi^{-}$ invariant mass spectrum, and the ALICE
collaboration have determined the $K^{-}\Lambda$ scattering length from the
measurement of the momentum correlation functions in the heavy ion collisions.
Using the effective range expansion, we classify the nature of the pole of the
near-threshold eigenstate in terms of the scattering length, in the presence of
the decay channel. It is shown that the quasibound state below the threshold
can be described by only the scattering length, while the description of the
resonance above the threshold requires the contribution from the effective
range. Based on the chiral unitary approach, we construct a theoretical model
which generates the pole of $\Xi(1620)$ below the $\bar{K}\Lambda$ threshold
with relatively narrow width, as reported by the Belle collaboration. It is
quantitatively demonstrated that the spectrum of the $\Xi(1620)$ quasibound
state is distorted by the effect of the nearby $\bar{K}\Lambda$ threshold. We
then construct another model which reproduces the $K^{-}\Lambda$ scattering
length by the ALICE collaboration. In this case, the eigenstate pole does not
appear in the physically relevant Riemann sheets, and the spectrum shows a cusp
structure at the $\bar{K}\Lambda$ threshold. We finally examine the
compatibility of the value of the $\bar{K}\Lambda$ scattering length and the
subthreshold pole of $\Xi(1620)$ including the experimental uncertainties.

These patterns have the potential to reveal the pathological mechanism and

However, the current studies mainly focus on using empirical functional time

a novel Multi-resolution Spatiotemporal Enhanced Transformer Denoising (MSETD)
network with an adversarially functional diffusion model is proposed to map
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) into effective connectivity for
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) analysis. To be specific, the denoising
framework leverages a conditional diffusion process that progressively
translates the noise and conditioning fMRI to effective connectivity in an
end-to-end manner. To ensure reverse diffusion quality and diversity, the
multi-resolution enhanced transformer generator is designed to extract local
and global spatiotemporal features. Furthermore, a multi-scale diffusive
transformer discriminator is devised to capture the temporal patterns at
different scales for generation stability. Evaluations of the ADNI datasets
demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed model. The proposed
model not only achieves superior prediction performance compared with other
competing methods but also identifies MCI-related causal connections that are
consistent with clinical studies.

first factorize the knowledge learned by GNNs into low- and high-frequency

prosody pattern in the joint multi-modal space with the elaborate design of the
encoder inputs and contrastive loss; 2) We introduce a multi-scale pre-training
pipeline to capture prosody patterns in multiple levels. We show how to
incorporate CLAPSpeech into existing TTS models for better prosody. Experiments

prediction for existing TTS methods, but also demonstrate its generalization

with a specific focus on scaling up 3D representations to enable open-world 3D
shape understanding. To achieve this, we scale up training data by ensembling
multiple 3D datasets and propose several strategies to automatically filter and
enrich noisy text descriptions. We also explore and compare strategies for
scaling 3D backbone networks and introduce a novel hard negative mining module
for more efficient training. We evaluate OpenShape on zero-shot 3D
classification benchmarks and demonstrate its superior capabilities for
open-world recognition. Specifically, OpenShape achieves a zero-shot accuracy
of 46.8% on the 1,156-category Objaverse-LVIS benchmark, compared to less than
10% for existing methods. OpenShape also achieves an accuracy of 85.3% on
ModelNet40, outperforming previous zero-shot baseline methods by 20% and
performing on par with some fully-supervised methods. Furthermore, we show that
our learned embeddings encode a wide range of visual and semantic concepts
(e.g., subcategories, color, shape, style) and facilitate fine-grained text-3D
and image-3D interactions. Due to their alignment with CLIP embeddings, our
learned shape representations can also be integrated with off-the-shelf
CLIP-based models for various applications, such as point cloud captioning and

briefly. A major part of this article is devoted to the recent Monte Carlo
investigations into the roles of boundary conditions, dynamics and the
Geometrical structures on the relaxation of magnetic monolayers modelled by
two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. We have studied all these effects for a two
dimensional Ising system with two types of deformations, namely preserving and
area non-preserving.The Glauber protocol and Metropolis dynamical rules are
employed in our simulations and we investigated the systems with both periodic
and open boundary conditions.
  The major findings are the exponential relaxation and the dependence of
relaxation time ($\tau$) on the aspect ratio $R$ (length over breadth). A power
law dependence ($\tau \sim R^{-s}$) has been observed for larger values of
aspect ratio ($R$). The linear thermal ($T$) dependence of exponent ($s$) has
been noticed ($s = aT + b$). The transient behaviours of the spin-flip density
have also been studied here for both surface and bulk/core. Both the saturated
bulk/core and saturated surface spin-flip density are observed to follow the
logarithmic dependence $f_{d} = a + b~\log(L)$ with the system size ($L$).
  For open boundary condition with any kind (Metropolis/Glauber) of dynamical
rule, the faster relaxation has been observed. Similarly, Metropolis algorithm
yields faster relaxation for any kind (open/periodic) of boundary condition. We
appeal to the experimentalists for experimental support which may be applied in
judicious {\it magnetic coating} of the credit cards for quicker response.

adversarial amendment (AdvAmd) method aims to improve the original accuracy
level of neural models on benign samples. We thoroughly analyze the
distribution mismatch between the benign and adversarial samples. This
distribution mismatch and the mutual learning mechanism with the same learning
ratio applied in prior art defense strategies is the main cause leading the
accuracy degradation for benign samples. The proposed AdvAmd is demonstrated to
steadily heal the accuracy degradation and even leads to a certain accuracy
boost of common neural models on benign classification, object detection, and
segmentation tasks. The efficacy of the AdvAmd is contributed by three key
components: mediate samples (to reduce the influence of distribution mismatch
with a fine-grained amendment), auxiliary batch norm (to solve the mutual

adjust the learning ratios according to different attack vulnerabilities)

Catch-Up Distillation (CUD), which encourages the current moment output of the

Specifically, CUD adjusts the original Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)

semantic communications are applied to multi-modal scenarios to boost

existing end-to-end neural network (NN) based framework without the channel

Moreover, most end-to-end designs are task-specific and require re-design and

propose a distributed multi-modal semantic communication framework

semantic encoder and decoder to extract correlated semantic information

the proposed framework, we further establish a general rate-adaptive coding
mechanism for various types of multi-modal semantic tasks. In particular, we
utilize unequal error protection based on semantic importance, which is derived
by evaluating the distortion bound of each modality. We further formulate and
solve an optimization problem that aims at minimizing inference delay while
maintaining inference accuracy for semantic tasks. Numerical results show that
the proposed mechanism fares better than both conventional communication and
existing semantic communication systems in terms of task performance, inference

the influence of both the viscosity of the air or other fluid that is modelled

Tensor train Finite Element Method -- TetraFEM -- and the explicit numerical
scheme for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation via Tensor
Trains. We test this approach on the simulation of liquids mixing in a T-shape
mixer, which, to our knowledge, was done for the first time using tensor
methods in such non-trivial geometries. As expected, we achieve exponential
compression in memory of all FEM matrices and demonstrate an exponential
speed-up compared to the conventional FEM implementation on dense meshes. In
addition, we discuss the possibility of extending this method to a quantum
computer to solve more complex problems. This paper is based on work we
conducted for Evonik Industries AG.

derived tasks in a timely manner, such as writing a description for the
intention of the code change, or identifying the defect-prone code changes.
Considering that the cost of dealing with these tasks can account for a large
proportion (typically around 70 percent) of the total development expenditure,
automating such processes will significantly lighten the burdens of developers.
To achieve such a target, existing approaches mainly rely on training deep
learning models from scratch or fine-tuning existing pretrained models on such
tasks, both of which have weaknesses. Specifically, the former uses
comparatively small-scale labelled data for training, making it difficult to
learn and exploit the domain knowledge of programming language hidden in the
large-amount unlabelled code in the wild; the latter is hard to fully leverage
the learned knowledge of the pre-trained model, as existing pre-trained models
are designed to encode a single code snippet rather than a code change (i.e.,
the difference between two code snippets). We propose to pre-train a model
specially designed for code changes to better support developers in software
maintenance. To this end, we first collect a large-scale dataset containing
1.5M+ pairwise data of code changes and commit messages. Based on these data,
we curate five different tasks for pre-training, which equip the model with
diverse domain knowledge about code changes. We fine-tune the pre-trained
model, CCT5, on three widely-studied tasks incurred by code changes and two
tasks specific to the code review process. Results show that CCT5 outperforms
both conventional deep learning approaches and existing pre-trained models on
these tasks.

be easily applied to any pre-trained language model as a postprocessing

complement traditional password authentication, making it a tempting target for

especially for the presentation attack studied by most prior works, the threats
are nearly eliminated by liveness detection and attempt limit. In this paper,
we study the seemingly impossible fingerprint brute-force attack on
off-the-shelf smartphones and propose a generic attack framework. We implement
BrutePrint to automate the attack, that acts as a middleman to bypass attempt

zero-day vulnerabilities in smartphone fingerprint authentication (SFA)
framework, and the hijacking leverages the simplicity of SPI protocol.
Moreover, we consider a practical cross-device attack scenario and tackle the
liveness and matching problems with neural style transfer (NST). We also
propose a method based on neural style transfer to generate valid brute-forcing
inputs from arbitrary fingerprint images. A case study shows that we always
bypasses liveness detection and attempt limit while 71% spoofs are accepted. We
evaluate BrutePrint on 10 representative smartphones from top-5 vendors and 3

separation of spectator nucleons and the fluidization of the generated particle
distributions are performed. The polarization of all anti-hyperon species is
found significantly larger than that of hyperons. The $\overline{\Xi}$ hyperons
are found to be polarized as strong as $\overline{\Lambda}$s but $\Xi$ hyperons
have weaker polarization compared to $\Lambda$s. The $\Omega$ and
$\overline{\Omega}$ polarizations show the strongest dependence on the
collision energy. Despite the strong polarization of the produced $\Lambda$s
and $\overline{\Lambda}$s induced by the vortical flows in the medium, the
observed polarization signal is significantly depleted because of the feed down
from weak and electromagnetic decays of heavier hyperons. Particularly strong
suppression is found to be due to electromagnetic decays of $\Sigma^0$
hyperons, which multiplicities obtained in the transport are poorly constrained
both from the microscopic input of the $\Sigma^0$ production reactions and from
the experimental data. The final $\Lambda(\overline{\Lambda})$ polarization
signal strongly depends on the $\Sigma^0$ multiplicity generated in the model.
With all these effects we can reproduce the measured global $\Lambda$
polarization in collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=7.7$ and $11.5$ GeV and the global
$\overline{\Lambda}$ polarization at 11.5 GeV. For energies $< 3$ GeV, the
calculated $\Lambda$ polarization is smaller than the observed one. The
polarization of $\Xi(\overline{\Xi})$ hyperons is calculated. The signal of
$\Xi(\overline{\Xi})$ polarization is argued to be insensitive to feed-down
effects and be a more direct probe of the degree of the vorticity in the

lacks explainability and is limited to some specific application scenarios.
Existing forgery localization methods suffer from imprecise and inconsistent
pixel-level annotations. To alleviate these problems, this paper first
re-constructs the FaceForensics++ dataset by introducing pixel-level
annotations, then builds an extensive benchmark for localizing tampered
regions. Next, a novel Multi-Spectral Class Center Network (MSCCNet) is
proposed for face manipulation detection and localization. Specifically,
inspired by the power of frequency-related forgery traces, we design
Multi-Spectral Class Center (MSCC) module to learn more generalizable and
semantic-agnostic features. Based on the features of different frequency bands,
the MSCC module collects multispectral class centers and computes
pixel-to-class relations. Applying multi-spectral class-level representations
suppresses the semantic information of the visual concepts, which is
insensitive to manipulations. Furthermore, we propose a Multi-level Features
Aggregation (MFA) module to employ more low-level forgery artifacts and
structure textures. Experimental results quantitatively and qualitatively
indicate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed MSCCNet on
comprehensive localization benchmarks. We expect this work to inspire more
studies on pixel-level face manipulation localization. The annotations and code
will be available.

of asteroids from this dataset. We computed the viewing and illumination
geometry for each individual observation and used the light curve inversion
method to find the best-fit asteroid model, which was parameterized by the
sidereal rotation period, the spin axis direction, and a low-resolution convex
shape. To find the best-fit model, we ran the inversion for tens of thousands
of trial periods on interval 2-10,000 h, with tens of initial pole directions.
To find the correct rotation period, we also used a triaxial ellipsoid model
for the shape approximation. In most cases the number of data points was
insufficient to uniquely determine the rotation period. However, for about 8600
asteroids we were able to determine the spin state uniquely together with a
low-resolution convex shape model. This large sample of new asteroid models
enables us to study the spin distribution in the asteroid population. The
distribution of spins confirms previous findings that (i) small asteroids have
poles clustered toward ecliptic poles, likely because of the YORP-induced spin
evolution, (ii) asteroid migration due to the Yarkovsky effect depends on the
spin orientation, and (iii) members of asteroid families have the sense of
rotation correlated with their proper semimajor axis: over the age of the
family, orbits of prograde rotators evolved, due to the Yarkovsky effect, to
larger semimajor axes, while those of retrograde rotators drifted in the
opposite direction.

training samples. Further, considering the utilizability of samples, we
designed UAFL to adaptively assign different loss weights to learnable positive
samples depending on their gradient ratio and IoU. Experimental results show

nonmagnetic AEIn2As2 (AE= Ca, Sr, Ba) employing a hybrid functional method. We

EuSn2As2, BaIn2As2, EuCd2Bi2 and EuCd2SbBi are robust topological insulators,
while all other compounds are topologically trivial semiconductors. The
topologically trivial Eu-based systems are antiferromagnetic semiconductors
with a strong red shift of the energy gap in a magnetic field caused by the
exchange coupling of the band states to spins localized on the 4f-shell of Eu
ions. Additionally, the EuIn2X2 (X = P, As) compounds show altermagnetic
exchange-induced band spin-splitting, particularly noticeable in the case of

challenges for such methods are the automatic selection of good or even optimal

approach that addresses the first problem for linear, unstructured systems is
the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA), which computes optimal
interpolation points through iterative updates by solving linear eigenvalue
problems. However, in the case of preserving internal system structures,
optimal interpolation points are unknown, and heuristics based on nonlinear
eigenvalue problems result in numbers of potential interpolation points that
typically exceed the reasonable size of reduced-order systems. In our work, we
propose a projection-based iterative interpolation method inspired by IRKA for
generally structured systems to adaptively compute near-optimal interpolation
points as well as an appropriate size for the reduced-order system.
Additionally, the iterative updates of the interpolation points can be chosen
such that the reduced-order model provides an accurate approximation in

outperforms the established methods in terms of accuracy and computational

X-ray binary Cyg X-1, spanning several cycles of its 5.6 day orbital period.
Week-long observations on two telescopes located in opposite hemispheres
allowed us to track the evolution of the polarization within one orbital cycle
with the highest temporal resolution to date. Using the field stars, we
determine the interstellar polarization in the source direction and
subsequently its intrinsic polarization. The optical polarization angle is
aligned with that in the X-rays as recently obtained with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer. Furthermore, it is consistent, within the uncertainties,
with the position angle of the radio ejections. We show that the intrinsic PD
is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\sim$0.2% and
discuss various sites of its production. Assuming the polarization arises from
a single Thomson scattering of the primary star radiation by the matter that
follows the black hole in its orbital motion, we constrain the inclination of
the binary orbit $i>120^\circ$ and its eccentricity $e<0.08$. The asymmetric
shape of the orbital profiles of Stokes parameters implies also the asymmetry
of the scattering matter distribution about the orbital plane, which may arise
from the tilted accretion disk. We compare our data to the polarimetric
observations made over 1975-1987 and find good, within $1^\circ$, agreement

one of their most significant applications. An effect that causes faster
expansion can be linked to how much the Lorentz symmetry of our universe is
violated. Moreover, since we do not know what generates dark energy, the
bumblebee gravity theory seems highly plausible. By utilizing the physical
changes happening around a rotating bumblebee black hole (RBBH), we aim to
obtain more specific details about the bumblebee black hole's spacetime and our
universe. However, as researched in the literature, slow-spinning RBBH (SRBBH)
spacetime, which has a higher accuracy, will be considered instead of general
RBBH. To this end, we first employ the Rindler--Ishak method (RIM), which

We evaluate the deflection angle of null geodesics in the equatorial plane of
the SRBBH spacetime. Then, we use astrophysical data to see the effect of the
Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter on the bending angle of light for
numerous astrophysical stars and black holes. We also acquire the analytical
greybody factors (GFs) and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of the SRBBH. Finally, we

very difficult to annotate different pairs of functions with accurate labels.
These supervised learning methods can easily be overtrained with inaccurate

propose GraphMoco: a graph momentum contrast model that uses multimodal

We take an unsupervised learning approach and make full use of the structural

perspective of quasi-normal modes (QNMs), the momentum-space scattering
extremizations with respect to varying incident directions of plane waves. It
is revealed that for effective single-QNM excitations, scatterings are
maximized exactly along those directions where the QNM radiation reaches its

direction, when the incident polarization is tuned to be orthogonal to that of
the mode radiation, the QNM cannot be excited and thus the scatterer becomes
invisible with null scatterings. The principles we have revealed are protected
by fundamental laws of reciprocity and energy conservation (optical theorem),
which can be further expanded and applied for other branches of wave physics.

becoming more prevalent. Integrating these data sets can be a way to solidify
findings and even to make new discoveries. However, integrating multi-omics
data sets is challenging. Typically, data sets are integrated by performing an
all-vs-all correlation analysis, where each feature of the first data set is
correlated to each feature of the second data set. However, all-vs-all
association testing produces unstructured results that are hard to interpret,
and involves potentially unnecessary hypothesis testing that reduces
statistical power due to false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment.
  Implementation: Here, we present the anansi framework, and accompanying R
package, as a way to improve upon all-vs-all association analysis. We take a
knowledge-based approach where external databases like KEGG are used to
constrain the all-vs-all association hypothesis space, only considering
pairwise associations that are a priori known to occur. This produces
structured results that are easier to interpret, and increases statistical
power by skipping unnecessary hypothesis tests. In this paper, we present the
anansi framework and demonstrate its application to learn metabolite-function
interactions in the context of host-microbe interactions. We further extend our
framework beyond pairwise association testing to differential association
testing, and show how anansi can be used to identify associations that differ
in strength or degree based on sample covariates such as case/control status.

Next-generation direct detection experiments, designed primarily for

and Borexino, a low-energy solar neutrino experiment, to investigate the impact

key idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message

embeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user
behavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits
skewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,
leverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the

self-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the
exploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error

contrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better

or Verilog) and eventually synthesized into a DSA on an ASIC
(application-specific integrated circuit) or FPGA (field-programmable gate
arrays). However, existing HLS tools still require microarchitecture decisions,
expressed in terms of pragmas (such as directives for parallelization and
pipelining). To enable more people to design DSAs, it is desirable to automate
such decisions with the help of deep learning for predicting the quality of HLS
designs. This requires us a deeper understanding of the program, which is a
combination of original code and pragmas. Naturally, these programs can be
considered as sequence data, for which large language models (LLM) can help. In
addition, these programs can be compiled and converted into a control data flow

diffusion model named GETDiff. GETScore represents notes as tokens and
organizes them in a 2D structure, with tracks stacked vertically and
progressing horizontally over time. During training, tracks are randomly
selected as either the target or source. In the forward process, target tracks
are corrupted by masking their tokens, while source tracks remain as ground

tokens, conditioning on the source tracks. With separate tracks in GETScore and
the non-autoregressive behavior of the model, GETMusic can explicitly control
the generation of any target tracks from scratch or conditioning on source
tracks. We conduct experiments on music generation involving six instrumental
tracks, resulting in a total of 665 combinations. GETMusic provides
high-quality results across diverse combinations and surpasses prior works

complex Ginzburg-Landau equation describing the dynamics of dissipative light
bullets in optical fiber amplifiers under the interplay between dopants and a
spatially nonlocal nonlinear response. The model equation includes the effects
of fiber dispersion, linear gain, nonlinear loss, fiber nonlinearity, atomic
detuning, linear and nonlinear diffractive transverse effects, and nonlocal
nonlinear response. A system of coupled ordinary differential equations for the
amplitude, temporal, and spatial pulse widths and position of the pulse
maximum, unequal wavefront curvatures, chirp parameters, and phase shift is
derived using the variational technique. A stability criterion is established,
where a domain of dissipative parameters for stable steady-state solutions is
found. Direct integration of the proposed nonlocal evolution equation is
performed, which allows us to investigate the evolution of the Gaussian beam
along a doped nonlocal optical fiber, showing stable self-organized dissipative
spatiotemporal light bullets.

  Understanding with a Two-Pass Model","Accepted at ACL 2023 (Findings)",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Language is by its very nature incremental in how it is produced and
processed. This property can be exploited by NLP systems to produce fast
responses, which has been shown to be beneficial for real-time interactive
applications. Recent neural network-based approaches for incremental processing
mainly use RNNs or Transformers. RNNs are fast but monotonic (cannot correct
earlier output, which can be necessary in incremental processing).
Transformers, on the other hand, consume whole sequences, and hence are by
nature non-incremental. A restart-incremental interface that repeatedly passes
longer input prefixes can be used to obtain partial outputs, while providing
the ability to revise. However, this method becomes costly as the sentence
grows longer. In this work, we propose the Two-pass model for AdaPtIve Revision
(TAPIR) and introduce a method to obtain an incremental supervision signal for
learning an adaptive revision policy. Experimental results on sequence
labelling show that our model has better incremental performance and faster
inference speed compared to restart-incremental Transformers, while showing
little degradation on full sequences.

dielectric liquid between a wire electrode and two plate electrodes with a
Poiseuille flow, using direct numerical simulation and global stability
analysis. Both conduction and injection mechanisms for charge generation are
considered. In this work, we focused on the intensity of the cross-flow and
studied the EHD flows without a cross-flow, with a weak cross-flow and with a
strong cross-flow. (1)In the case without a cross-flow, we investigated its
nonlinear flow structures and linear dynamics. We found that the flow in the
conduction regime is steady, whereas the flow in the injection regime is
oscillatory, which can be explained by a global stability analysis. (2)The EHD
flow with a weak cross-flow is closely related to the flow phenomena in
electrostatic precipitator (ESP). Our analyses indicate that increasing the
cross-flow intensity or the electric Reynolds number leads to a less stable
flow. Based on these results, we infer that one should adopt a relatively low
voltage and weak cross-flow in the wire-plate EHD flow to avoid flow
instability, which may hold practical implications for ESP. (3)The case of
strong cross-flow is examined to study the EHD effect on the wake flow. By
comparing the conventional cylindrical wake with the EHD wake in linear and
nonlinear regimes, we found that the EHD effect brings forward the vortex
shedding in wake flows. Besides, the EHD effect reduces the drag coefficient
when the cross-flow is weak, but increases it when it is strong.

we present a 3D registration method with maximal cliques (MAC). The key insight
is to loosen the previous maximum clique constraint, and mine more local
consensus information in a graph for accurate pose hypotheses generation: 1) A
compatibility graph is constructed to render the affinity relationship between
initial correspondences. 2) We search for maximal cliques in the graph, each of
which represents a consensus set. We perform node-guided clique selection then,
where each node corresponds to the maximal clique with the greatest graph
weight. 3) Transformation hypotheses are computed for the selected cliques by
the SVD algorithm and the best hypothesis is used to perform registration.
Extensive experiments on U3M, 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch and KITTI demonstrate that MAC
effectively increases registration accuracy, outperforms various
state-of-the-art methods and boosts the performance of deep-learned methods.
MAC combined with deep-learned methods achieves state-of-the-art registration

  Perturbations",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial perturbations has
been widely perceived in the computer vision community. From a security
perspective, it poses a critical risk for modern vision systems, e.g., the
popular Deep Learning as a Service (DLaaS) frameworks. For protecting
off-the-shelf deep models while not modifying them, current algorithms
typically detect adversarial patterns through discriminative decomposition of
natural-artificial data. However, these decompositions are biased towards
frequency or spatial discriminability, thus failing to capture subtle
adversarial patterns comprehensively. More seriously, they are typically
invertible, meaning successful defense-aware (secondary) adversarial attack
(i.e., evading the detector as well as fooling the model) is practical under
the assumption that the adversary is fully aware of the detector (i.e., the
Kerckhoffs's principle). Motivated by such facts, we propose an accurate and
secure adversarial example detector, relying on a spatial-frequency
discriminative decomposition with secret keys. It expands the above works on
two aspects: 1) the introduced Krawtchouk basis provides better
spatial-frequency discriminability and thereby is more suitable for capturing
adversarial patterns than the common trigonometric or wavelet basis; 2) the
extensive parameters for decomposition are generated by a pseudo-random
function with secret keys, hence blocking the defense-aware adversarial attack.
Theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrates the increased accuracy and
security of our detector w.r.t. a number of state-of-the-art algorithms.

This makes it challenging to exploit GPUs effectively: using GPUs to sample

aggregating many features exhibits high data movement costs between GPUs and

feature aggregation, limiting throughput.
  We describe Quiver, a distributed GPU-based GNN serving system with

predicts the degree of parallelism in graph sampling. Quiver uses this metric
to assign sampling tasks to GPUs only when the performance gains surpass
CPU-based sampling; and (2) for feature aggregation, Quiver relies on the
feature access probability to decide which features to partition and replicate

  Relation Recognition",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR) aims at classifying the
relation sense between two arguments without an explicit connective. Recently,
the ConnPrompt~\cite{Wei.X:et.al:2022:COLING} has leveraged the powerful prompt
learning for IDRR based on the fusion of multi-prompt decisions from three
different yet much similar connective prediction templates. Instead of
multi-prompt ensembling, we propose to design auxiliary tasks with enlightened
prompt learning for the IDRR task. Although an auxiliary task is not used to
directly output final prediction, we argue that during the joint training some
of its learned features can be useful to boost the main task. In light of such
motivations, we propose a task enlightenment prompt learning model, called
TEPrompt, to fuse learned features from three related tasks for IDRR. In
particular, the TEPrompt contains three tasks, viz., Discourse Relation
Recognition (DRR), Sense Semantics Classification (SSC) and Annotated
Connective Prediction (ACP), each with a unique prompt template and an answer
space. In the training phase, we jointly train three prompt learning tasks with
shared argument representation. In the testing phase, we only take the DRR
output with fused features as the final IDRR decision. Experiments with the
same conditions have shown that the proposed TEPrompt outperforms the
ConnPrompt. This can be attributed to the promoted decision features and
language models benefited from joint-training of auxiliary tasks.

extend a semantic segmentation model to novel classes according to only a few
pixel-level annotated data, while preserving its segmentation capability on
previously learned base categories. This task faces a severe semantic-aliasing
issue between base and novel classes due to data imbalance, which makes
segmentation results unsatisfactory. To alleviate this issue, we propose the
Semantic-guided Relation Alignment and Adaptation (SRAA) method that fully
considers the guidance of prior semantic information. Specifically, we first
conduct Semantic Relation Alignment (SRA) in the base step, so as to
semantically align base class representations to their semantics. As a result,
the embeddings of base classes are constrained to have relatively low semantic
correlations to categories that are different from them. Afterwards, based on
the semantically aligned base categories, Semantic-Guided Adaptation (SGA) is
employed during the incremental learning stage. It aims to ensure affinities
between visual and semantic embeddings of encountered novel categories, thereby
making the feature representations be consistent with their semantic
information. In this way, the semantic-aliasing issue can be suppressed. We
evaluate our model on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and the COCO dataset. The
experimental results on both these two datasets exhibit its competitive
performance, which demonstrates the superiority of our method.

sticking and hydrogen evolution, play a crucial role in energy storage, fuel

studying these processes due to its widespread use as both a catalyst in
industry and a model catalyst in fundamental research. Theoretical studies can
help to decipher underlying mechanisms and reaction design, but studying these
systems computationally is challenging due to the complex electronic structure
of metal surfaces and the high sensitivity towards reaction barriers. In
addition, ab initio molecular dynamics, based on density functional theory, is
too computationally demanding to explicitly simulate reactive sticking or
desorption probabilities. A promising solution to such problems can be provided
through high-dimensional machine learning-based interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
Despite the remarkable accuracy and fidelity of MLIPs, particularly in
molecular and bulk inorganic materials simulations, their application to
different facets of hybrid systems and the selection of appropriate
representations remain largely unexplored. This paper addresses these issues
and investigates how feature equivariance in MLIPs impacts adaptive sampling
workflows and data efficiency. Specifically, we develop high-dimensional MLIPs
to investigate reactive hydrogen scattering on copper surfaces and compare the
performance of various MLIPs that use equivariant features for atomic

Our findings demonstrate that using equivariant features can greatly enhance
the accuracy and reliability of MLIPs for gas surface dynamics and that this

outline how to compute warm inflation dynamics from first principles quantum

inflation models can have an inflaton mass bigger than the Hubble scale and the
inflaton field excursion can remain sub-Planckian, thus overcoming the most

hypothetical models, which by now are acting as a diversion from reaching any

reliability and accuracy of predictive models. Despite the development of
numerous recalibration algorithms, there is still a lack of a comprehensive
theory that integrates calibration and sharpness (which is essential for
maintaining predictive power). In this paper, we introduce the concept of
minimum-risk recalibration within the framework of mean-squared-error (MSE)
decomposition, offering a principled approach for evaluating and recalibrating
probabilistic classifiers. Using this framework, we analyze the uniform-mass
binning (UMB) recalibration method and establish a finite-sample risk upper
bound of order $\tilde{O}(B/n + 1/B^2)$ where $B$ is the number of bins and $n$
is the sample size. By balancing calibration and sharpness, we further
determine that the optimal number of bins for UMB scales with $n^{1/3}$,
resulting in a risk bound of approximately $O(n^{-2/3})$. Additionally, we
tackle the challenge of label shift by proposing a two-stage approach that
adjusts the recalibration function using limited labeled data from the target
domain. Our results show that transferring a calibrated classifier requires
significantly fewer target samples compared to recalibrating from scratch. We
validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations, which confirm
the tightness of the proposed bounds, the optimal number of bins, and the
effectiveness of label shift adaptation.

a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) IoT network (IoTNe). For a
noiseless fusion center (FC), it is demonstrated that the MSE performance is
determined by the number of RF chains used at each IoT node (IoTNo). Next, the
minimum-MSE RF transmit precoders (TPCs) and receive combiner (RC) matrices are
designed for this setup using the dominant array response vectors, and
subsequently, a closed-form expression is obtained for the baseband (BB) TPC at
each IoTNo using Cauchy's interlacing theorem. For a realistic noisy FC, it is
shown that the resultant mean squared error (MSE) minimization problem is
non-convex. To address this challenge, a block-coordinate descent-based
iterative scheme is proposed to obtain the fully digital TPC and RC matrices
followed by the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) technique for
decomposing the fully-digital transceiver into its corresponding RF and BB
components. A theoretical proof of the convergence is also presented for the
proposed iterative design procedure. Furthermore, robust hybrid transceiver
designs are also derived for a practical scenario in the face of channel state
information (CSI) uncertainty. The centralized MMSE lower bound has also been
derived that benchmarks the performance of the proposed LDE schemes. Finally,
our numerical results characterize the performance of the proposed transceivers

containing one or more atoms. If the constituting unit cell is not
centrosymmetric, charge may distribute unevenly between the atoms, resulting in
internal electric polarization. This effect serves as the basis for numerous
ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric phenomena. In nearly all polar
materials, including multilayered van der Waals stacks that were recently found
to exhibit interfacial polarization, inversion symmetry is broken by having two
or more atomic species within the unit cell. Here, we show that even elemental
crystals, consisting of one type of atom, and composed of non-polar
centrosymmetric layers, exhibit electric polarization if arranged in an
appropriate three-dimensional architecture. This concept is demonstrated here
for inversion and mirror asymmetric mixed-stacking tetra-layer polytypes of
non-polar graphene sheets. Furthermore, we find that the room temperature
out-of-plane electric polarization increases with external electrostatic
doping, rather than decreases owing to screening. Using first-principles
calculations, as well as tight-binding modeling, we unveil the origin of
polytype-induced polarization and its dependence on doping. Extension of this
idea to graphene multilayers suggests that solely by lateral shifts of
constituent monolayers one can obtain multiple meta-stable interlayer stacking
sequences that may allow for even larger electrical polarization.

complex for the student model to thoroughly process. However, good teachers in
real life always simplify complex material before teaching it to students.
Inspired by this fact, we propose student-friendly knowledge distillation (SKD)
to simplify teacher output into new knowledge representations, which makes the
learning of the student model easier and more effective. SKD contains a
softening processing and a learning simplifier. First, the softening processing
uses the temperature hyperparameter to soften the output logits of the teacher
model, which simplifies the output to some extent and makes it easier for the
learning simplifier to process. The learning simplifier utilizes the attention
mechanism to further simplify the knowledge of the teacher model and is jointly
trained with the student model using the distillation loss, which means that
the process of simplification is correlated with the training objective of the
student model and ensures that the simplified new teacher knowledge
representation is more suitable for the specific student model. Furthermore,
since SKD does not change the form of the distillation loss, it can be easily
combined with other distillation methods that are based on the logits or
features of intermediate layers to enhance its effectiveness. Therefore, SKD
has wide applicability. The experimental results on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet
datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining high training efficiency.

of machine learning and statistics ranging from causal inference to
reinforcement learning. Estimators for these tasks, generally called methods of
moments, include the prominent generalized method of moments (GMM) which has
recently gained attention in causal inference. GMM is a special case of the
broader family of empirical likelihood estimators which are based on
approximating a population distribution by means of minimizing a
$\varphi$-divergence to an empirical distribution. However, the use of
$\varphi$-divergences effectively limits the candidate distributions to
reweightings of the data samples. We lift this long-standing limitation and
provide a method of moments that goes beyond data reweighting. This is achieved
by defining an empirical likelihood estimator based on maximum mean discrepancy
which we term the kernel method of moments (KMM). We provide a variant of our
estimator for conditional moment restrictions and show that it is
asymptotically first-order optimal for such problems. Finally, we show that our
method achieves competitive performance on several conditional moment
restriction tasks.

minor adversarial perturbations, which may not only undermine prediction
accuracy (robustness) but also cause biased predictions for similar inputs
(individual fairness). Accurate fairness has been recently proposed to enforce
a harmonic balance between accuracy and individual fairness. It induces the
notion of fairness confusion matrix to categorize predictions as true fair,
true biased, false fair, and false biased. This paper proposes a harmonic
evaluation approach, RobustFair, for the accurate fairness of DNNs, using
adversarial perturbations crafted through fairness confusion directed gradient
search. By using Taylor expansions to approximate the ground truths of
adversarial instances, RobustFair can particularly identify the robustness
defects entangled for spurious fairness, which are often elusive in robustness
evaluation, and missing in individual fairness evaluation. RobustFair can boost
robustness and individual fairness evaluations by identifying robustness or
fairness defects simultaneously. Empirical case studies on fairness benchmark
datasets show that, compared with the state-of-the-art white-box robustness and
individual fairness testing approaches, RobustFair detects significantly
1.77-11.87 times adversarial perturbations, yielding 1.83-13.12 times biased
and 1.53-8.22 times false instances. The adversarial instances can then be
effectively exploited to improve the accurate fairness (and hence accuracy and
individual fairness) of the original deep neural network through retraining.
The empirical case studies further show that the adversarial instances
identified by RobustFair outperform those identified by the other testing
approaches, in promoting 21% accurate fairness and 19% individual fairness on
multiple sensitive attributes, without losing accuracy at all or even promoting
it by up to 4%.

practice when writing software. Package managers are used to manage
dependencies to third-party libraries by automating the process of installing
and updating the libraries. Library dependencies themselves can have
dependencies to other libraries creating a dependency network with several
levels of indirections. The library dependency network in the Swift ecosystem
encompasses libraries from CocoaPods, Carthage and Swift Package Manager (PM).
These package managers are used when developing, for example, iOS or Mac OS
applications in Swift and Objective-C. We provide the first analysis of the
library dependency network evolution in the Swift ecosystem. Although CocoaPods
is the package manager with the biggest set of libraries, the difference to
other package managers is not as big as expected. The youngest package manager
and official package manager for Swift, Swift PM, is becoming more and more
popular, resulting in a gradual slow-down of the growth of the other two
package managers. When analyzing direct and transitive dependencies, we found
that the mean total number of dependencies is lower in the Swift ecosystem
compared to many other ecosystems. Still, the total number of dependencies
shows a clear growing trend over the last five years.

phase transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at the macroscale are, in
fact, encoded within the microscopic energy levels of its fundamental
constituents, the quarks. We establish a connection between the cumulants of
the chiral order parameter, i.e., the chiral condensate, and the correlations
among the energy levels of quarks, i.e., the eigenspectra of the massless QCD
Dirac operator. This relation elucidates how the fluctuations of the chiral
condensate arise from the correlations within the infrared part of the energy
spectra of quarks, and naturally leads to a generalization of the Banks-Casher
relation for the cumulants of the chiral condensate. Then, through (2+1)-flavor
lattice QCD calculations with varying light quark masses near the QCD chiral
transition, we demonstrate that the correlations among the infrared part of the
Dirac eigenvalue spectra exhibit same universal scaling behaviors as expected
of the cumulants of the chiral condensate. We find that these universal scaling

IBCD.In the first stage, it estimates the patch size in a search-based manner

verify the effectiveness and efficiency of IBCD.

suffers from the off-target issue, where the translation is in the wrong

this work, we find that failing in encoding discriminative target language
signal will lead to off-target and a closer lexical distance (i.e.,
KL-divergence) between two languages' vocabularies is related with a higher
off-target rate. We also find that solely isolating the vocab of different

we propose Language Aware Vocabulary Sharing (LAVS), a simple and effective
algorithm to construct the multilingual vocabulary, that greatly alleviates the
off-target problem of the translation model by increasing the KL-divergence
between languages. We conduct experiments on a multilingual machine translation
benchmark in 11 languages. Experiments show that the off-target rate for 90
translation tasks is reduced from 29\% to 8\%, while the overall BLEU score is
improved by an average of 1.9 points without extra training cost or sacrificing

Additionally, about 15 percent of the HAEs are as compact as the most massive

the high galaxy density and cold dynamical state (i.e., velocity dispersion of

from a first slow-roll inflation stage with a Hubble parameter H = Hinf1 to a
second slow-roll inflation stage with H = Hinf2 > Hinf1, passing through an

a result, PBHs with masses and abundances of observational interest can be

in contemporary cognitive neuroscience where, for example, they inform
computational concepts of mental disorders. This includes predictive coding and
hierarchical Gaussian filtering (HGF), which differ in the nature of
hierarchical representations. Predictive coding assumes that higher levels in a
given hierarchy influence the state (value) of lower levels. In HGF, however,
higher levels determine the rate of change at lower levels. Here, we extend the
space of generative models underlying HGF to include a form of nonlinear
hierarchical coupling between state values akin to predictive coding and
artificial neural networks in general. We derive the update equations
corresponding to this generalization of HGF and conceptualize them as
connecting a network of (belief) nodes where parent nodes either predict the
state of child nodes or their rate of change. This enables us to (1) create
modular architectures with generic computational steps in each node of the
network, and (2) disclose the hierarchical message passing implied by
generalized HGF models and to compare this to comparable schemes under
predictive coding. We find that the algorithmic architecture instantiated by
the generalized HGF is largely compatible with that of predictive coding but
extends it with some unique predictions which arise from precision and
volatility related computations. Our developments enable highly flexible
implementations of hierarchical Bayesian models for empirical data analysis and
are available as open source software.

properties so that it is expected to be hard to simulate such states using

samples of non-trivial probability distributions that at certain condition are
hard to obtain classically. For realistic experimental conditions the problem
is to probe multi-photon interference with a limited number of the measurement

of a battery pack using a cooling fluid. This is modeled by a coupled 1D
partial differential equation (PDE) with a controlled advection term that
determines the speed of the cooling fluid. The Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
equation is a PDE that evaluates the optimality of the value function and
determines an optimal controller. We propose an algorithm that treats the value
network as a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve for the
continuous-time HJB equation rather than a discrete-time Bellman optimality
equation, and we derive an optimal controller for the environment that we
exploit to achieve optimal control. Our experiments show that a hybrid-policy
method that updates the value network using the HJB equation and updates the
policy network identically to PPO achieves the best results in the control of
this PDE system.

attention recently to control complex systems to desired behaviors, where nodes
represent system components and edges encode their interactions. Driver nodes,
which are directly controlled by external inputs, play a crucial role in
controlling all network nodes. While many approaches have been proposed to
identify driver nodes of static networks, we still lack an effective algorithm
to control ubiquitous temporal networks, where network structures evolve over
time. Here we propose an effective online time-accelerated heuristic algorithm
(OTaHa) to detect driver nodes of temporal networks. Together with theoretical
analysis and numerical simulations on synthetic and empirical temporal
networks, we show that OTaHa offers multiple sets of driver nodes, and
noticeably outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and execution
time. We further report that most edges are redundant in controlling temporal
networks although the complete instantaneous signal-carrying edges cannot be
guaranteed. Moreover, removing edges with high edge betweenness (the number of
all-pairs shortest paths passing through the edge) significantly impedes the
overall controllability. Our work provides an effective algorithm and paves the
way for subsequent explorations on achieving the ultimate control of temporal
networks.

promising solution for systematic design in this situation. In this paper, we
theoretically analyze the computational advantages of SNSs compared with other

Methods for mitigating this radiation damage have been previously explored,
such as thermal and optical (laser) annealing. Here we investigate in a lab,

low response latency to handle on-demand user requests. There are two prominent
techniques employed for reducing the response latency: keep fully initialized
containers alive (Warm Container) or reduce the new container startup (cold
start) latency.
  This paper presents the 3rd container startup mode: Hibernate Container,
which starts faster than the cold start container mode and consumes less memory
than the Warm Container mode. Hibernate Container is essentially a ""deflated""
Warm Container. Its application memory is swapped out to disk, the freed memory
is reclaimed and file based mmap memory is cleaned-up. The Hibernate
Container's deflated memory is inflated in response to user requests. As
Hibernate Container's application is fully initialized, its response latency is
less than the cold start mode; and as the application memory is deflated, its
memory consumption is less than the Warm Container mode. Additionally, when a
Hibernate Container is ""woken up"" to process a request, the Woken-up Container
has similar response latency to Warm Container but less memory consumption
because not all the deflated memory needs to be inflated. We implemented the
Hibernate technique as part of the open source Quark secure container runtime
project and our test demonstrated that Hibernate Container consumes about 7\%
to 25\% of the Warm Container memory. All of this results in a higher
deployment density, lower latency and appreciable improvements in the overall

propose a new error indicator derived from a recovery-based error estimator
that is less computationally expensive and more reliable. Secondly, we
introduce a new stopping criterion that suggests stopping when the norm of the
linear residual is less than a small fraction of an error indicator derived
directly from the residual. This indicator shares the same mesh size and
polynomial degree scaling as the norm of the residual, resulting in a robust
criterion regardless of the mesh size, the polynomial degree, and the shape
regularity of the mesh. Thirdly, in solving Poisson problems with highly
variable piecewise constant coefficients, we introduce a subdomain-based
criterion that recommends stopping when the norm of the linear residual
restricted to each subdomain is smaller than the corresponding indicator also
restricted to that subdomain. Numerical experiments, including tests with
anisotropic meshes and highly variable piecewise constant coefficients,

adversarial networks (GANs) via manually annotated training data or a prior 3D
model, which often lack flexibility, precision, and generality. In this work,
we study a powerful yet much less explored way of controlling GANs, that is, to
""drag"" any points of the image to precisely reach target points in a
user-interactive manner, as shown in Fig.1. To achieve this, we propose
DragGAN, which consists of two main components: 1) a feature-based motion
supervision that drives the handle point to move towards the target position,
and 2) a new point tracking approach that leverages the discriminative
generator features to keep localizing the position of the handle points.
Through DragGAN, anyone can deform an image with precise control over where
pixels go, thus manipulating the pose, shape, expression, and layout of diverse
categories such as animals, cars, humans, landscapes, etc. As these
manipulations are performed on the learned generative image manifold of a GAN,
they tend to produce realistic outputs even for challenging scenarios such as
hallucinating occluded content and deforming shapes that consistently follow
the object's rigidity. Both qualitative and quantitative comparisons

  Adverse Scenes","10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D object detection plays a crucial role in numerous intelligent vision
systems. Detection in the open world inevitably encounters various adverse
scenes, such as dense fog, heavy rain, and low light conditions. Although
existing efforts primarily focus on diversifying network architecture or
training schemes, resulting in significant progress in 3D object detection,
most of these learnable modules fail in adverse scenes, thereby hindering
detection performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes a monocular
3D detection model designed to perceive twin depth in adverse scenes, termed
MonoTDP, which effectively mitigates the degradation of detection performance
in various harsh environments. Specifically, we first introduce an adaptive
learning strategy to aid the model in handling uncontrollable weather
conditions, significantly resisting degradation caused by various degrading
factors. Then, to address the depth/content loss in adverse regions, we propose
a novel twin depth perception module that simultaneously estimates scene and
object depth, enabling the integration of scene-level features and object-level
features. Additionally, we assemble a new adverse 3D object detection dataset
encompassing a wide range of challenging scenes, including rainy, foggy, and
low light weather conditions, with each type of scene containing 7,481 images.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current
state-of-the-art approaches by an average of 3.12% in terms of AP_R40 for car
category across various adverse environments.

For classification tasks, we have evaluated pre-trained models such as VGG16,
MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, ResNet50, and DenseNet121 models. Among them,
MobileNetV2 outperformed all other models in terms of Accuracy (Acc), Recall,

Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and related applications in 5G/6G networks

virtualization technique that replaced Virtual Memory (VM). Mobile IoT
applications, e.g., intelligent transportation and augmented reality,
incorporating fog-edge, have increased the demand for a millisecond-scale
response and processing time. Edge Computing reduces remote network traffic and
latency. These services must run on edge nodes that are physically close to
devices. However, classical migration techniques may not meet the requirements
of future mission-critical IoT applications. IoT mobile devices have limited
resources for running multiple services, and client-server latency worsens when
fog-edge services must migrate to maintain proximity in light of device
mobility. This study analyzes the performance of the MiGrror migration method
and the pre-copy live migration method when the migration of multiple
VMs/containers is considered. This paper presents mathematical models for the
stated methods and provides migration guidelines and comparisons for services
to be implemented as multiple containers, as in microservice-based
environments. Experiments demonstrate that MiGrror outperforms the pre-copy
technique and, unlike conventional live migrations, can maintain less than 10
milliseconds of downtime and reduce migration time with a minimal bandwidth
overhead. The results show that MiGrror can improve service continuity and
availability for users. Most significant is that the model can use average and
non-average values for different parameters during migration to achieve
improved and more accurate results, while other research typically only uses
average values. This paper shows that using only average parameter values in
migration can lead to inaccurate results.

selecting a clean sample of genuine LMC member stars and predicts the geometry

of axisymmetry. Our Jeans dynamical models describe well the rotation profile

sensing and communications will operate within the near-field region, thus
making the conventional designs based on the far-field channel models
inapplicable. This paper studies a near-field multiple-input-multiple-output
(MIMO) radar sensing system, in which the transceivers with massive antennas
aim to localize multiple near-field targets in the three-dimensional (3D)
space. In particular, we adopt a general wavefront propagation model by
considering the exact spherical wavefront with both channel phase and amplitude
variations over different antennas. Besides, we consider the general transmit
signal waveforms and also consider the unknown cluttered environments. Under
this setup, the unknown parameters to estimate include the 3D coordinates and
the complex reflection coefficients of the multiple targets, as well as the
noise and interference covariance matrix. Accordingly, we derive the
Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target coordinates and reflection
coefficients. Next, to facilitate practical localization, we propose an
efficient estimator based on the 3D approximate cyclic optimization (3D-ACO),
which is obtained following the maximum likelihood (ML) criterion. Finally,
numerical results show that considering the exact antenna-varying channel
amplitudes achieves more accurate CRB as compared to prior works based on
constant channel amplitudes across antennas, especially when the targets are
close to the transceivers. It is also shown that the proposed estimator
achieves localization performance close to the derived CRB, thus validating its
superior performance.

  Privacy Budget",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative models trained with Differential Privacy (DP) are increasingly
used to produce synthetic data while reducing privacy risks. Navigating their
specific privacy-utility tradeoffs makes it challenging to determine which
models would work best for specific settings/tasks. In this paper, we fill this
gap in the context of tabular data by analyzing how DP generative models
distribute privacy budgets across rows and columns, arguably the main source of
utility degradation. We examine the main factors contributing to how privacy
budgets are spent, including underlying modeling techniques, DP mechanisms, and
data dimensionality.
  Our extensive evaluation of both graphical and deep generative models sheds
light on the distinctive features that render them suitable for different
settings and tasks. We show that graphical models distribute the privacy budget
horizontally and thus cannot handle relatively wide datasets while the
performance on the task they were optimized for monotonically increases with
more data. Deep generative models spend their budget per iteration, so their
behavior is less predictable with varying dataset dimensions but could perform
better if trained on more features. Also, low levels of privacy
($\epsilon\geq100$) could help some models generalize, achieving better results
than without applying DP.

and reinforcement learning. While lifelong learning algorithms have been
investigated mainly within a single-agent approach, a question remains on how
multiple agents can share lifelong learning knowledge with each other. We show
that the parameter isolation mechanism used by modulating masks is particularly
suitable for exchanging knowledge among agents in a distributed and
decentralized system of lifelong learners. The key idea is that the isolation
of specific task knowledge to specific masks allows agents to transfer only
specific knowledge on-demand, resulting in robust and effective distributed
lifelong learning. We assume fully distributed and asynchronous scenarios with
dynamic agent numbers and connectivity. An on-demand communication protocol
ensures agents query their peers for specific masks to be transferred and
integrated into their policies when facing each task. Experiments indicate that
on-demand mask communication is an effective way to implement distributed
lifelong reinforcement learning and provides a lifelong learning benefit with
respect to distributed RL baselines such as DD-PPO, IMPALA, and PPO+EWC. The
system is particularly robust to connection drops and demonstrates rapid

similarity and (2) the sparsely-annotated training data only provide weak

address these two challenges. To tackle the intrinsic similarity challenge, we
design a multi-scale feature grouping module that first groups features at
different granularities and then aggregates these grouping results. By grouping
similar features together, it encourages segmentation coherence, helping obtain
complete segmentation results for both single and multiple-object images. For
the weak supervision challenge, we utilize the recently-proposed vision
foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and use the provided sparse
annotations as prompts to generate segmentation masks, which are used to train
the model. To alleviate the impact of low-quality segmentation masks, we
further propose a series of strategies, including multi-augmentation result
ensemble, entropy-based pixel-level weighting, and entropy-based image-level
selection. These strategies help provide more reliable supervision to train the
segmentation model. We verify the effectiveness of our method on various WSCOS
tasks, and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art

neutron stars (NSs) are often characterized by the iso-scalar and iso-vector
nuclear matter parameters (NMPs). Recent attempts to relate the radius and
tidal deformability of a NS to the individual NMPs have been inconclusive.
These properties display strong correlations with the pressure of NS matter
which depends on several NMPs. The knowledge of minimal NMPs that determine the
NS properties will be necessary to address any connection between NS properties
(e.g., tidal deformability) and that of finite nuclei.
  Purpose: To identify the important NMPs required to describe the tidal
deformability of neutron star for astrophysically relevant range of their
gravitational masses (1.2 -- 1.8 M$_\odot$) as encountered in the binary
neutron star merger events.
  Method: We construct a large set of EoSs using four iso-scalar and five
iso-vector NMPs. These EOSs are employed to perform a systematic analysis to
isolate the NMPs that predominantly determine the tidal deformability, over a
wide range of NS mass. The tidal deformability is then directly mapped to these
NMPs.
  Results: The tidal deformability of the NS with mass 1.2-1.8 M$_\odot$ can be
determined within 10$\%$ directly in terms of four nuclear matter parameters,
namely, the incompressibility $K_0$ and skewness $Q_0$ of symmetric nuclear
matter, and the slope $L_0$ and curvature parameter $K_{\rm sym,0}$ of symmetry
energy.
  Conclusion: A function that quickly estimates the value of tidal
deformability in terms of minimal nuclear matter parameters is developed. Our
method can also be extended to other NS observables.

each with its own notion of scale, and define this property as multi-relevance.
To understand how this property affects RG analysis, we construct a model that
has two distinct notions of scale, each corresponding to the state of an
unobserved latent variable. In the regime where this latent variable can be
inferred using a linear classifier, the vertex expansion approach in
non-perturbative RG can be applied successfully but will give different answers
depending the choice of expansion point in state space. Next, in the regime
where linear estimation of the latent state fails, we show that an application
of the vertex expansion predicts a decrease in the total number of relevant
couplings from four to three. One consequence of this is that PCA-like
coarse-graining can eliminate important, resolvable parameters, and further, it
may only identify meaningless collective degrees of freedom. Taken together,
these results suggest that using RG in these new domains may lead to
oversimplification if multi-relevance is not accounted for.

  We use a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with ReLU activation to model the

  We require a tiny network structure for MIP to scale. The Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis states that a large network is likely to contain a winning ticket --
a much smaller subnetwork that won the initialization lottery, which makes its
training particularly effective. We train a large network and prune it into a
tiny subnetwork (i.e., draw a ticket). We run MIP-based worst-case training on
the drawn subnetwork and evaluate the training result's worst-case performance
(i.e., scratch the ticket). If the subnetwork can not achieve good worst-case
performance, then we record the type profiles that cause the current draw to be
bad. To draw again, we restore the large network to its initial weights and
prune using recorded type profiles from earlier draws (i.e., redraw from the
original ticket pot while avoiding drawing the same ticket twice). With a large

eventually encounter a tiny trainable subnetwork.

as planners: given a task, generate a plan. We investigate whether LLMs can
serve as generalized planners: given a domain and training tasks, generate a
program that efficiently produces plans for other tasks in the domain. In
particular, we consider PDDL domains and use GPT-4 to synthesize Python
programs. We also consider (1) Chain-of-Thought (CoT) summarization, where the
LLM is prompted to summarize the domain and propose a strategy in words before
synthesizing the program; and (2) automated debugging, where the program is
validated with respect to the training tasks, and in case of errors, the LLM is
re-prompted with four types of feedback. We evaluate this approach in seven
PDDL domains and compare it to four ablations and four baselines. Overall, we
find that GPT-4 is a surprisingly powerful generalized planner. We also
conclude that automated debugging is very important, that CoT summarization has
non-uniform impact, that GPT-4 is far superior to GPT-3.5, and that just two
training tasks are often sufficient for strong generalization.

RE by being on the shortest dependency path between two entities. We then take
advantage of the high accuracy of current syntactic parsers in order to
automatically obtain large amounts of low-cost pre-training data. By
pre-training our RE model on the relevant syntactic relations, we are able to
outperform the baseline in five out of six cross-domain setups, without any

learning techniques. Many past research endeavors focused on using the
first-order policy gradient information to train policy networks. Different
from these works, we conduct research in this paper driven by the believe that
properly utilizing and controlling Hessian information associated with the
policy gradient can noticeably improve the performance of policy gradient
algorithms. One key Hessian information that attracted our attention is the
Hessian trace, which gives the divergence of the policy gradient vector field
in the Euclidean policy parametric space. We set the goal to generalize this
Euclidean policy parametric space into a general Riemmanian manifold by
introducing a metric tensor field $g_ab$ in the parametric space. This is
achieved through newly developed mathematical tools, deep learning algorithms,
and metric tensor deep neural networks (DNNs). Armed with these technical
developments, we propose a new policy gradient algorithm that learns to
minimize the absolute divergence in the Riemannian manifold as an important
regularization mechanism, allowing the Riemannian manifold to smoothen its
policy gradient vector field. The newly developed algorithm is experimentally
studied on several benchmark reinforcement learning problems. Our experiments
clearly show that the new metric tensor regularized algorithm can significantly
outperform its counterpart that does not use our regularization technique.
Additional experimental analysis further suggests that the trained metric
tensor DNN and the corresponding metric tensor $g_{ab}$ can effectively reduce
the absolute divergence towards zero in the Riemannian manifold.

perspective -- the sensitivity to degree of deformations in CT images. Although
some learning-based methods have shown success in terms of average accuracy,
their ability to handle regions with local large deformation (LLD) may
significantly decrease compared to dealing with regions with minor deformation.
This motivates our research into this issue. Two main causes of LLDs are organ
motion and changes in tissue structure, with the latter often being a long-term
process. In this paper, we propose a novel registration model called
Cascade-Dilation Inter-Layer Differential Network (CDIDN), which exhibits both
high deformation impedance capability (DIC) and accuracy. CDIDN improves its
resilience to LLDs in CT images by enhancing LLDs in the displacement field
(DF). It uses a feature-based progressive decomposition of LLDs, blending
feature flows of different levels into a main flow in a top-down manner. It
leverages Inter-Layer Differential Module (IDM) at each level to locally refine
the main flow and globally smooth the feature flow, and also integrates feature
velocity fields that can effectively handle feature deformations of various
degrees. We assess CDIDN using lungs as representative organs with large
deformation. Our findings show that IDM significantly enhances LLDs of the DF,
by which improves the DIC and accuracy of the model. Compared with other
outstanding learning-based methods, CDIDN exhibits the best DIC and excellent
accuracy. Based on vessel enhancement and enhanced LLDs of the DF, we propose a
novel method to accurately track the appearance, disappearance, enlargement,
and shrinkage of pulmonary lesions, which effectively addresses detection of
early lesions and peripheral lung lesions, issues of false enlargement, false
shrinkage, and mutilation of lesions.

Optimistic NPG is computationally efficient, and learns an

  Extraction with Wordpieces and Aspect Enhancement","Accepted at ACL 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  State-of-the-art target-oriented opinion word extraction (TOWE) models
typically use BERT-based text encoders that operate on the word level, along
with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) that incorporate syntactic information
extracted from syntax trees. These methods achieve limited gains with GCNs and
have difficulty using BERT wordpieces. Meanwhile, BERT wordpieces are known to
be effective at representing rare words or words with insufficient context
information. To address this issue, this work trades syntax trees for BERT
wordpieces by entirely removing the GCN component from the methods'
architectures. To enhance TOWE performance, we tackle the issue of aspect
representation loss during encoding. Instead of solely utilizing a sentence as
the input, we use a sentence-aspect pair. Our relatively simple approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and should serve as a
strong baseline for further research.

We fabricate photoelastic spherical particles of diameter d=2mm, and make a

water into the oil-filled photoelastic granular pack, varying the injection

different modes of fluid invasion: viscous fingering, and fracturing with
leak-off of the injection fluid. We directly visualize the evolving effective
stress field through the particles' photoelastic response, and discover a hoop
effective stress region behind the water invasion front, where we observe
tensile force chains in the circumferential direction. Outside the invasion

conceptualize the system's behavior by means of a two-phase poroelastic

the boundary delineated by the invasion front, which explains the observed
distinct alignments of the force chains. Finally, we rationalize the crossover
from viscous fingering to fracturing by comparing the competing forces behind
the process: viscous force from fluid injection that drives fractures, and
intergranular cohesion and friction that resist fractures.

systems (NIDS). Concurrently, the abilities of adversaries to evade security
have also increased with the support of AI/ML models. Therefore, defenders need
to proactively prepare for evasion attacks that exploit the detection
mechanisms of NIDS. Recent studies have found that the perturbation of
flow-based and packet-based features can deceive ML models, but these
approaches have limitations. Perturbations made to the flow-based features are
difficult to reverse-engineer, while samples generated with perturbations to
the packet-based features are not playable.
  Our methodological framework, Deep PackGen, employs deep reinforcement
learning to generate adversarial packets and aims to overcome the limitations
of approaches in the literature. By taking raw malicious network packets as
inputs and systematically making perturbations on them, Deep PackGen
camouflages them as benign packets while still maintaining their functionality.
In our experiments, using publicly available data, Deep PackGen achieved an
average adversarial success rate of 66.4\% against various ML models and across
different attack types. Our investigation also revealed that more than 45\% of
the successful adversarial samples were out-of-distribution packets that evaded
the decision boundaries of the classifiers. The knowledge gained from our study
on the adversary's ability to make specific evasive perturbations to different
types of malicious packets can help defenders enhance the robustness of their
NIDS against evolving adversarial attacks.

edges in a graph on $n$ vertices such that all the missing edges can be

it is possible to embed edges of $K_n$ in a vector space in a certain way

using cluster analysis. We then attempt to improve the diversity-preservation
qualities of well known recommendation techniques by adopting a parent
selection algorithm from the evolutionary computation literature known as
lexicase selection. Our results show that lexicase selection, or a mixture of
lexicase selection and ranking, outperforms its purely ranked counterparts in
terms of personalization, coverage and our specifically designed serendipity
benchmark, while only slightly under-performing in terms of accuracy (hit
rate). We verify these results across a variety of recommendation list sizes.
In this work we show that lexicase selection is able to maintain multiple
diverse clusters of item recommendations that are each relevant for the
specific user, while still maintaining a high hit-rate accuracy, a trade off
that is not achieved by other methods.

that for orbits with negative energy, the trajectory remains prograde despite
the negative angular momentum. Furthermore, we investigate the intriguing

  to Improve Generalization Ability of Dense Retrieval","Accepted by ACL 2023 Main",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when
trained on in-domain labeled datasets. However, previous studies have found
that dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak
modeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal
between two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this
paper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense
retrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained
expression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching
signal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and
two unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint
in training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit
balance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level
view and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a
fine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage
representation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching
information from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR
show that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval
training methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to
improve its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead
and target domain data.

problems. These problems have been introduced by Verbin and Yu [SODA 2011] and
have found numerous applications in proving streaming lower bounds. In the
noisy gap cycle counting problem (NGC), there is a small integer $k \geq 1$ and
an $n$-vertex graph consisted of vertex-disjoint union of either $k$-cycles or
$2k$-cycles, plus $O(n/k)$ disjoint paths of length $k-1$ in both cases
(``noise''). The edges of this graph are partitioned between Alice and Bob
whose goal is to decide which case the graph belongs to with minimal
communication from Alice to Bob.
  We study the robust communication complexity -- `a la Chakrabarti, Cormode,
and McGregor [STOC 2008] -- of NGC, namely, when edges are partitioned randomly
between the players. This is in contrast to all prior work on gap cycle
counting problems in adversarial partitions. While NGC can be solved trivially
with zero communication when $k < \log{n}$, we prove that when $k$ is a
constant factor larger than $\log{n}$, the robust (one-way) communication
complexity of NGC is $\Omega(n)$ bits.
  As a corollary of this result, we can prove several new graph streaming lower
bounds for random order streams. In particular, we show that any streaming
algorithm that for every $\varepsilon > 0$ estimates the number of connected
components of a graph presented in a random order stream to within an
$\varepsilon \cdot n$ additive factor requires $2^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$
space, settling a conjecture of Peng and Sohler [SODA 2018]. We further discuss
new implications of our lower bounds to other problems such as estimating size
of maximum matchings and independent sets on planar graphs, random walks, as
well as to stochastic streams.

of measures on the sphere, rational zonotopes, identified as finite sums of
Dirac masses, are dense in the class of all zonoids. Moreover, we show that a
rational zonoid can be obtained from a coercive Ising system if and only if the
corresponding measure satisfies some connectedness properties, while it is
always a continuum limit of discrete Wulff shapes under the only condition that
the support of the measure spans the whole space. Finally, we highlight the

  Inverse Problems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Inverse problems describe the task of recovering an underlying signal of
interest given observables. Typically, the observables are related via some
non-linear forward model applied to the underlying unknown signal. Inverting
the non-linear forward model can be computationally expensive, as it often
involves computing and inverting a linearization at a series of estimates.
Rather than inverting the physics-based model, we instead train a surrogate
forward model (emulator) and leverage modern auto-grad libraries to solve for
the input within a classical optimization framework. Current methods to train
emulators are done in a black box supervised machine learning fashion and fail
to take advantage of any existing knowledge of the forward model. In this
article, we propose a simple learned weighted average model that embeds
linearizations of the forward model around various reference points into the
model itself, explicitly incorporating known physics. Grounding the learned
model with physics based linearizations improves the forward modeling accuracy
and provides richer physics based gradient information during the inversion
process leading to more accurate signal recovery. We demonstrate the efficacy
on an ocean acoustic tomography (OAT) example that aims to recover ocean sound
speed profile (SSP) variations from acoustic observations (e.g. eigenray
arrival times) within simulation of ocean dynamics in the Gulf of Mexico.

$\kappa$, for a complete Riemannian metric and a three-form $H$ on a manifold
$M$. Its most salient feature is that it involves several terms quadratic in
the curvature tensor of a metric connection with skew-symmetric torsion $H$.
When $\kappa = 0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to the generalized Ricci

second-order correction prescribed by Heterotic string theory, whereas when
$H=0$ and $\kappa >0$ the Heterotic-Ricci flow reduces to a constrained version

is explored using the hot Jupiter WASP-33b as an example. We simulate
low-resolution spectroscopic data for observations with the JWST's NIRSpec
instrument and use high resolution observational data obtained from the Subaru
InfraRed Doppler instrument (IRD). Vibrational band-specific OH cross section
sets are constructed and used in retrievals on the (simulated) low and (real)
high resolution data. Low resolution observations are simulated for two
WASP-33b emission scenarios: under the assumption of local thermal equilibrium
(LTE) and a toy non-LTE model for vibrational excitation of selected bands. We
show that mixing ratios for individual bands can be retrieved with sufficient
precision to allow the vibrational population distributions of the forward
models to be reconstructed. A simple fit for the Boltzmann distribution in the
LTE case shows that the vibrational temperature is recoverable in this manner.
For high resolution, cross-correlation applications, we apply the individual
vibrational band analysis to an IRD spectrum of WASP-33b, applying an
'un-peeling' technique. Individual detection significances for the two
strongest bands are shown to be in line with Boltzmann distributed vibrational
state populations consistent with the effective temperature of the WASP-33b
atmosphere reported previously. We show the viability of this approach for
analysing the individual vibrational state populations behind observed and
simulated spectra including reconstructing state population distributions.

invariants, \textit{i.e.}, the Ricci scalar and the eigenvalues of the Riemann

respective onsets and regions of repulsive gravity. Afterwards, we compare the
repulsive regions obtained from these metrics among themselves and then with
the predictions got from the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m and Schwarzschild-de
Sitter. We find that the Dymnikova spacetime does not exhibit regions in which
gravity changes its sign. A notable characteristic, observed in all these
metrics, is that the repulsive regions appear to be unaffected by the mass that
generates the regular black hole. This property emerges due to the invariants
employed in our analysis, which do not change sign through \emph{linear
combinations} of the mass and the free coefficients of the metrics. As a
result, gravity can change sign independently of the specific values acquired
by the mass. This conclusion suggests a potential \emph{incompleteness} of
regular solutions, particularly in terms of their repulsive effects. To further
highlight this finding, we numerically compute, for the Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m

the repulsive effects found in the Bardeen and Hayward spacetimes. These
selected values of $M$ provide evidence that regular black holes do not

such, minimizing the latency of LLM inference by curtailing computational and

important. However, this process inevitably instigates a trade-off between
efficiency and accuracy, as compressed LLMs typically experience a reduction in
predictive precision. In this research, we introduce an innovative perspective:
to optimize this trade-off, compressed LLMs require a unique input format that
varies from that of the original models. Our findings indicate that the
generation quality in a compressed LLM can be markedly improved for specific
queries by selecting prompts with precision. Capitalizing on this insight, we
introduce a prompt learning paradigm that cultivates an additive prompt over a
compressed LLM to bolster their accuracy. Our empirical results imply that
through our strategic prompt utilization, compressed LLMs can match, and
occasionally even exceed, the accuracy of the original models. Moreover, we
demonstrated that these learned prompts have a certain degree of
transferability across various datasets, tasks, and compression levels. These
insights shine a light on new possibilities for enhancing the balance between
accuracy and efficiency in LLM inference. Specifically, they underscore the
importance of judicious input editing to a compressed large model, hinting at

column densities in the TMC-1 dark molecular cloud. In interstellar sources
further along the path of star formation, such as those where a protostar
itself has been formed, the chemistry is known to be drastically different from
that of largely quiescent dark clouds. To that end, we have tested the ability
of various machine learning models to fit the column densities of the molecules
detected in source B of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS 16293-2422. By
including a simple encoding of isotopic composition in our molecular feature

the isotopic ratios. Finally, we report the predicted column densities of the
chemically relevant molecules that may be excellent targets for
radioastronomical detection in IRAS 16293-2422B.

high solution quality, a data-driven optimization framework combining
techniques from the fields of Deep Learning and Approximation Algorithms is
introduced. The framework's key ingredient is a novel input-output processing

have witnessed increasing attention on prediction with only incomplete data
consisting of observed features and a mask that indicates the missing pattern.
Existing methods assume that the training and testing distributions are the
same, which may be violated in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we consider
prediction with incomplete data in the presence of distribution shift. We focus
on the case where the underlying joint distribution of complete features and
label is invariant, but the missing pattern, i.e., mask distribution may shift
agnostically between training and testing. To achieve generalization, we
leverage the observation that for each mask, there is an invariant optimal
predictor. To avoid the exponential explosion when learning them separately, we
approximate the optimal predictors jointly using a double parameterization
technique. This has the undesirable side effect of allowing the learned
predictors to rely on the intra-mask correlation and that between features and
mask. We perform decorrelation to minimize this effect. Combining the
techniques above, we propose a novel prediction method called StableMiss.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that
StableMiss is robust and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under agnostic
mask distribution shift.

satellite retrievals has enabled the development of machine learning (ML)
models to estimate dead FMC retrievals over the contiguous US (CONUS). In this
study, ML models were trained using variables from the National Water Model and
the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) NWP models, and static variables
characterizing the surface properties, as well as surface reflectances and land
surface temperature (LST) retrievals from the VIIRS instrument on board the
Suomi-NPP satellite system. Extensive hyper-parameter optimization yielded
skillful FMC models compared to a daily climatography RMSE (+44\%) and to an
hourly climatography RMSE (+24\%). Furthermore, VIIRS retrievals were important
predictors for estimating FMC, contributing significantly as a group due to
their high band-correlation. In contrast, individual predictors in the HRRR
group had relatively high importance according to the explainability techniques
used. When both HRRR and VIIRS retrievals were not used as model inputs, the
performance dropped significantly. If VIIRS retrievals were not used, the RMSE
performance was worse. This highlights the importance of VIIRS retrievals in
modeling FMC, which yielded better models compared to MODIS. Overall, the
importance of the VIIRS group of predictors corroborates the dynamic
relationship between the 10-h fuel and the atmosphere and soil moisture. These
findings emphasize the significance of selecting appropriate data sources for
predicting FMC with ML models, with VIIRS retrievals and selected HRRR
variables being critical components in producing skillful FMC estimates.

traveling from an origin to a destination across a national highway network
subject to a hard deadline, by optimizing path planning, speed planning, and
intermediary charging planning. Such a CFO problem is essential for
carbon-friendly e-truck operations. However, it is notoriously challenging to
solve due to (i) the hard deadline constraint, (ii) positive battery
state-of-charge constraints, (iii) non-convex carbon footprint objective, and
(iv) enormous geographical and temporal charging options with diverse carbon
intensity. Indeed, we show that the CFO problem is NP-hard. As a key
contribution, we show that under practical settings it is equivalent to finding
a generalized restricted shortest path on a stage-expanded graph, which extends
the original transportation graph to model charging options. Compared to
alternative approaches, our formulation incurs low model complexity and reveals
a problem structure useful for algorithm design. We exploit the insights to
develop an efficient dual-subgradient algorithm that always converges. As
another major contribution, we prove that (i) each iteration only incurs
polynomial-time complexity, albeit it requires solving an integer charging
planning problem optimally, and (ii) the algorithm generates optimal results if
a condition is met and solutions with bounded optimality loss otherwise.
Extensive simulations based on real-world traces show that our scheme reduces

Weinberg (2016) to a wide variety of non-solar type hosts. This process causes
the planet's orbit to decay and has potentially important consequences for the
evolution and fate of hot Jupiters. Previous studies either only accounted for
linear dissipation processes or assumed that the resonantly excited primary
mode becomes strongly nonlinear and breaks as it approaches the stellar center.
However, the great majority of hot Jupiter systems are in the weakly nonlinear
regime in which the primary mode does not break but instead excites a sea of
secondary modes via three-mode interactions. We simulate these nonlinear
interactions and calculate the net mode dissipation for stars that range in
mass from $0.5 M_\odot \le M_\star \le 2.0 M_\odot$ and in age from the early
main sequence to the subgiant phase. For stars with $M_\star \lesssim 1.0
M_\odot$ of nearly any age, we find that the orbital decay time is $\lesssim
100 \textrm{ Myr}$ for orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} \lesssim 1 \textrm{ day}$.
For $M_\star \gtrsim 1.2 M_\odot$, the orbital decay time only becomes short on
the subgiant branch, where it can be $\lesssim 10 \textrm{ Myr}$ for $P_{\rm

instabilities in Newtonian universes in 1902. This article contributes to a
fully nonlinear analysis of the gravitational instability for the Euler-Possion
system which models expanding Newtonian universes with inhomogeneous density
and pressure. The exponential or finite-time increasing blowups of the density
contrast $\varrho$ can be determined, which may account for the considerably
faster growth rate of nonlinear structures observed in astrophysics than that
suggested by the classical Jeans instability. We believe this is the first
rigorous result for the nonlinear Jeans instability with effective pressure and
the method is concise and robust.

to understand the behavior of magnetically confined plasma in numerical
simulations of a tokamak. These plots are created by the intersection of field
lines with a two-dimensional poloidal plane that is perpendicular to the axis
of the torus representing the tokamak. A plot is composed of multiple orbits,
each created by a different field line as it goes around the torus. Each orbit
can have one of four distinct shapes, or classes, that indicate changes in the
topology of the magnetic fields confining the plasma. Given the (x,y)
coordinates of the points that form an orbit, the analysis task is to assign a
class to the orbit, a task that appears ideally suited for a machine learning
approach. In this paper, we describe how we overcame two major challenges in
solving this problem - creating a high-quality training set, with few
mislabeled orbits, and converting the coordinates of the points into features
that are discriminating, despite the variation within the orbits of a class and
the apparent similarities between orbits of different classes. Our automated
approach is not only more objective and accurate than visual classification,
but is also less tedious, making it easier for plasma physicists to analyze the
topology of magnetic fields from numerical simulations of the tokamak.

to its lucrative and inherently chaotic nature. Many models looking to
accurately predict the trend of stocks have been based on Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). However, due to the limitations of RNNs, such as gradient
vanish and long-term dependencies being lost as sequence length increases, in
this paper we develop a Transformer based model that uses technical stock data
and sentiment analysis to conduct accurate stock trend prediction over long
time windows. This paper also introduces a novel dataset containing daily
technical stock data and top news headline data spanning almost three years.
Stock prediction based solely on technical data can suffer from lag caused by
the inability of stock indicators to effectively factor in breaking market
news. The use of sentiment analysis on top headlines can help account for
unforeseen shifts in market conditions caused by news coverage. We measure the
performance of our model against RNNs over sequence lengths spanning 5 business
days to 30 business days to mimic different length trading strategies. This
reveals an improvement in directional accuracy over RNNs as sequence length is
increased, with the largest improvement being close to 18.63% at 30 business
days.

integrating pixel color information as spatial coordinates. Next, we construct
a hypersurface composed of points based on the image dimensions, with each
smooth section within this hypersurface symbolizing a specific pixel location.
Polygonal face construction is achieved using an adjacency tensor. Finally, a
dense point cloud is generated by densely sampling the constructed
hypersurface, with a focus on regions of higher detail. The effectiveness of
our approach is demonstrated on a publicly accessible brain tumor dataset,
achieving significant improvements over existing classification techniques.
This methodology allows the extraction of intricate details from the original

  Configurations","30 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables; submitted to TOIS ACM journal",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In information retrieval systems, search parameters are optimized to ensure
high effectiveness based on a set of past searches and these optimized
parameters are then used as the system configuration for all subsequent
queries. A better approach, however, would be to adapt the parameters to fit
the query at hand. Selective query expansion is one such an approach, in which
the system decides automatically whether or not to expand the query, resulting
in two possible system configurations. This approach was extended recently to
include many other parameters, leading to many possible system configurations
where the system automatically selects the best configuration on a per-query
basis. To determine the ideal configurations to use on a per-query basis in
real-world systems we developed a method in which a restricted number of
possible configurations is pre-selected and then used in a meta-search engine
that decides the best search configuration on a per query basis. We define a
risk-sensitive approach for configuration pre-selection that considers the
risk-reward trade-off between the number of configurations kept, and system
effectiveness. For final configuration selection, the decision is based on
query feature similarities. We find that a relatively small number of
configurations (20) selected by our risk-sensitive model is sufficient to
increase effectiveness by about 15% according(P@10, nDCG@10) when compared to
traditional grid search using a single configuration and by about 20% when
compared to learning to rank documents. Our risk-sensitive approach works for
both diversity- and ad hoc-oriented searches. Moreover, the similarity-based
selection method outperforms the more sophisticated approaches. Thus, we
demonstrate the feasibility of developing per-query information retrieval
systems, which will guide future research in this direction.

and Scincus scincus, are capable of effectively and efficiently burying
themselves in soil. Biological Organisms employ various locomotion modes,
including coiling and uncoiling motions, asymmetric body twisting, and
undulating movements that generate motion waves. The coiling-uncoiling motion
drives a seed awn to bury itself like a corkscrew, while sandfish skinks use
undulatory swimming, which can be thought of as a 2D version of helical motion.
Studying burrowing behavior aims to understand how animals navigate
underground, whether in their natural burrows or underground habitats, and to
implement this knowledge in solving geotechnical penetration problems.
Underground horizontal burrowing is challenging due to overcoming the
resistance of interaction forces of granular media to move forward. Inspired by
the burrowing behavior of seed-awn and sandfish skink, a horizontal
self-burrowing robot is developed. The robot is driven by two augers and
stabilized by a fin structure. The robot's burrowing behavior is studied in a
laboratory setting. It is found that rotation and propulsive motion along the
axis of the auger's helical shape significantly reduce granular media's
resistance against horizontal penetration by breaking kinematic symmetry or
granular media boundary. Additional thrusting and dragging tests were performed
to examine the propulsive and resistive forces and unify the observed burrowing
behaviors. The tests revealed that the rotation of an auger not only reduces
the resistive force and generates a propulsive force, which is influenced by
the auger geometry, rotational speed, and direction. As a result, the burrowing
behavior of the robot can be predicted using the geometry-rotation-force
relations.

quantum neural networks on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
Recent studies have shown that a tensor-train network (TTN) for VQC, namely
TTN-VQC, can improve the representation and generalization powers of VQC.
However, the Barren Plateau problem leads to the gradients of the cost function
vanishing exponentially small as the number of qubits increases, making it
difficult to find the optimal parameters for the VQC. To address this issue, we
put forth a new learning approach called Pre+TTN-VQC that builds upon the
TTN-VQC architecture by incorporating a pre-trained TTN to alleviate the Barren
Plateau problem. The pre-trained TTN allows for efficient fine-tuning of target
data, which reduces the depth of the VQC required to achieve good empirical
performance and potentially alleviates the training obstacles posed by the
Barren Plateau landscape. Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of
Pre+TTN-VQC in terms of representation and generalization powers by exploiting
the error performance analysis. Moreover, we characterize the optimization
performance of Pre+TTN-VQC without the need for the Polyak-Lojasiewicz
condition, thereby enhancing the practicality of implementing quantum neural
networks on NISQ devices. We conduct experiments on a handwritten digit
classification dataset to corroborate our proposed methods and theorems.

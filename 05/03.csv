human motion retrieval. While previous work has only treated retrieval as a
proxy evaluation metric, we tackle it as a standalone task. Our method extends
the state-of-the-art text-to-motion synthesis model TEMOS, and incorporates a
contrastive loss to better structure the cross-modal latent space. We show that
maintaining the motion generation loss, along with the contrastive training, is
crucial to obtain good performance. We introduce a benchmark for evaluation and
provide an in-depth analysis by reporting results on several protocols. Our
extensive experiments on the KIT-ML and HumanML3D datasets show that TMR
outperforms the prior work by a significant margin, for example reducing the
median rank from 54 to 19. Finally, we showcase the potential of our approach
on moment retrieval. Our code and models are publicly available.

model such changes in depth and breadth of knowledge as a partitioning of the

algorithms that explicitly consider and adapt to the relationship between

drawbacks of a naive approach based on nearest neighbor queries. To address
these drawbacks we then introduce a novel algorithm - expertise trees - that
constructs decision trees enabling the learner to select appropriate models. We

  Entity Alignment",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-lingual and cross-domain knowledge alignment without sufficient
external resources is a fundamental and crucial task for fusing irregular data.
As the element-wise fusion process aiming to discover equivalent objects from
different knowledge graphs (KGs), entity alignment (EA) has been attracting
great interest from industry and academic research recent years. Most of
existing EA methods usually explore the correlation between entities and
relations through neighbor nodes, structural information and external
resources. However, the complex intrinsic interactions among triple elements
and role information are rarely modeled in these methods, which may lead to the
inadequate illustration for triple. In addition, external resources are usually
unavailable in some scenarios especially cross-lingual and cross-domain
applications, which reflects the little scalability of these methods. To tackle
the above insufficiency, a novel universal EA framework (OTIEA) based on
ontology pair and role enhancement mechanism via triple-aware attention is
proposed in this paper without introducing external resources. Specifically, an
ontology-enhanced triple encoder is designed via mining intrinsic correlations
and ontology pair information instead of independent elements. In addition, the
EA-oriented representations can be obtained in triple-aware entity decoder by
fusing role diversity. Finally, a bidirectional iterative alignment strategy is
deployed to expand seed entity pairs. The experimental results on three
real-world datasets show that our framework achieves a competitive performance
compared with baselines.

novel data cube search technique -- CUBGRISM -- originally developed for GALEX
can be applied to Roman grism data to produce a Ly$\alpha$ flux-limited sample
without the need for continuum detections. We investigate the impact of
altering the number of independent PAs and exposure time. A deep Roman grism
survey with 25 PAs and a total exposure time of $70$hrs can achieve Ly$\alpha$
line depths comparable to the deepest $z=7$ narrow-band surveys
($L_{{\rm{Ly}}\alpha}\gtrsim10^{43}$erg s$^{-1}$). Assuming a null result,
where the opacity of the intergalactic medium (IGM) remains unchanged from
$z\sim7$, this level of sensitivity will detect $\sim400$ deg$^{-2}$ Ly$\alpha$
emitters from $z=7.25-8.75$. A decline from this expected number density is the
signature of an increasing neutral hydrogen fraction and the onset of
reionization. Our simulations indicate that a deep Roman grism survey has the
ability to measure the timing and magnitude of this decline, allowing us to
infer the ionization state of the IGM and helping us to distinguish between

through experiments inside an oscillating box. The interactions between the
particles and the time-averaged (steady streaming) flow lead to the formation
of either one-particle-thick chains or multiple-particle-wide bands, depending
on the oscillatory conditions. Both the chains and the bands are oriented
perpendicular to the direction of oscillation with a regular spacing between
them. For all our experiments, this spacing is only a function of the relative
particle-fluid excursion length normalized by the particle diameter, $A_r/D$,
implying that it is an intrinsic quantity that is established only by the
hydrodynamics. In contrast, the width of the bands depends on both $A_r/D$ and
the confinement, characterized by the particle coverage fraction $\phi$. Using
the relation for the chain spacing, we accurately predict the transition from
one-particle-thick chains to wider bands as a function of $\phi$ and $A_r/D$.
Our experimental results are complemented with numerical simulations in which
the flow around the particles is fully resolved. These simulations show that
the regular chain spacing arises from the balance between long-range attractive
and short-range repulsive hydrodynamic interactions, caused by the vortices in
the steady streaming flow. We further show that these vortices induce an
additional attractive interaction at very short range when $A_r/D\gtrsim0.7$,
which stabilizes the multiple-particle-wide bands. Finally, we give a
comprehensive overview of the parameter space where we illustrate the different
regions using our experimental data.

we extend several theorems on the density, tightness, and contact numbers of
disk packings and totally separable disk packings to $\lambda$-separable
packings of circular disks of radius $\rho$ in the Euclidean, spherical, and

  Conditional Optimality","Preprint for ICALP'23 containing 25 pages and 10 figures",,,,"cs.FL cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Seminal results establish that the coverability problem for Vector Addition
Systems with States (VASS) is in EXPSPACE (Rackoff, '78) and is EXPSPACE-hard
already under unary encodings (Lipton, '76). More precisely, Rosier and Yen
later utilise Rackoff's bounding technique to show that if coverability holds
then there is a run of length at most $n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d \log d)}}$, where
$d$ is the dimension and $n$ is the size of the given unary VASS. Earlier,
Lipton showed that there exist instances of coverability in $d$-dimensional
unary VASS that are only witnessed by runs of length at least
$n^{2^{\Omega(d)}}$. Our first result closes this gap. We improve the upper
bound by removing the twice-exponentiated $\log(d)$ factor, thus matching
Lipton's lower bound. This closes the corresponding gap for the exact space
required to decide coverability. This also yields a deterministic
$n^{2^{\mathcal{O}(d)}}$-time algorithm for coverability. Our second result is
a matching lower bound, that there does not exist a deterministic
$n^{2^{o(d)}}$-time algorithm, conditioned upon the Exponential Time
Hypothesis.
  When analysing coverability, a standard proof technique is to consider VASS
with bounded counters. Bounded VASS make for an interesting and popular model
due to strong connections with timed automata. Withal, we study a natural
setting where the counter bound is linear in the size of the VASS. Here the
trivial exhaustive search algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^{d+1})$-time. We
give evidence to this being near-optimal. We prove that in dimension one this
trivial algorithm is conditionally optimal, by showing that $n^{2-o(1)}$-time
is required under the $k$-cycle hypothesis. In general fixed dimension $d$, we
show that $n^{d-2-o(1)}$-time is required under the 3-uniform hyperclique
hypothesis.

The search yielded one possible detection of OVII at a redshift z=0.1877 with
an OVI prior, with a statistical significance that is equivalent to a
2.6-$\sigma$ confidence level. The spectra were also stacked at the wavelengths
of the expected redshifted OVII and OVIII lines, but the analysis did not

framework for cosmological inferences from the analysis of absorption lines,

privacy (Abadi et al., 2016). Despite popularity and simplicity of the clipping
mechanism, its convergence guarantees often require specific values of $c$ and
strong noise assumptions.
  In this paper, we give convergence guarantees that show precise dependence on
arbitrary clipping thresholds $c$ and show that our guarantees are tight with
both deterministic and stochastic gradients. In particular, we show that (i)
for deterministic gradient descent, the clipping threshold only affects the
higher-order terms of convergence, (ii) in the stochastic setting convergence
to the true optimum cannot be guaranteed under the standard noise assumption,
even under arbitrary small step-sizes. We give matching upper and lower bounds
for convergence of the gradient norm when running clipped SGD, and illustrate
these results with experiments.

QUMOND, these GQUMOND theories require solving only the linear Poisson equation
(twice). Unlike QUMOND, their Lagrangian depends on higher derivatives of the
Newtonian potential. They thus dictate different ``phantom'' densities as
virtual sources in the Poisson equation for the MOND potential. These theories
might open new avenues to more fundamental theories, and have much heuristic
value. I use them to demonstrate that even within limited classes of
modified-gravity formulations of MOND, theories can differ substantially on
lower-tier MOND predictions. Such GQUMOND theories force, generically, the
introduction of dimensioned constants other than the MOND acceleration, $a_0$,
such as a length, a frequency, etc. As a result, some of these theories reduce
to QUMOND itself only, e.g., on length scales (or, in other versions, dynamical
times) larger than some critical value. But in smaller systems (or,
alternatively, in ones with shorter dynamical times), MOND effects are
screened, even if their internal accelerations are smaller than $a_0$. In such
theories it is possible that MOND (expressed as QUMOND) applies on galactic
scales, but its departures from Newtonian dynamics are substantially suppressed
in some subgalactic systems -- such as binary stars, and open, or globular star
clusters. The same holds for the effect of the galactic field on dynamics in
the inner solar system, which can be greatly suppressed compared with what
QUMOND predicts. Tidal effects of a galaxy on smaller subsystems are the same
as in QUMOND, for the examples I consider. I also describe briefly versions
that do not involve dimensioned constants other than $a_0$, and yet differ from
QUMOND in important ways.

helioseismic measurements in terms of magnetic field strength. We identify
three magnetograms on 18 November 2020, 3 October 2021, and 3 February 2022
displaying a total of six active regions on the far side. The first two dates
are from SO's cruise phase, the third from the beginning of the nominal
operation phase. We compute contemporaneous seismic phase maps for these three
dates using helioseismic holography applied to time series of Dopplergrams from
the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory

regions are identified on the seismic maps at almost the same positions as on
the magnetograms. One region is too weak to be detected above the seismic
noise. To calibrate the seismic maps, we fit a linear relationship between the
seismic phase shifts and the unsigned line-of-sight magnetic field averaged
over the active region areas extracted from the SO/PHI magnetograms. SO/PHI
provides the strongest evidence so far that helioseismic imaging provides

improves computational speed and the morphological properties of anatomical
structures; however, it also comes at the cost of substantial losses in spatial
specificity and sensitivity, especially when the signals exhibit high
within-ROI heterogeneity. Oftentimes, abnormally expressed functional
connectivity (FC) between a pair of ROIs caused by a brain disease is primarily
driven by only small subsets of voxel pairs within the ROI pair. This article
proposes a new network method for detection of voxel-pair-level neural
dysconnectivity with spatial constraints. Specifically, focusing on an ROI
pair, our model aims to extract dense sub-areas that contain aberrant
voxel-pair connections while ensuring that the involved voxels are spatially
contiguous. In addition, we develop sub-community-detection algorithms to
realize the model, and the consistency of these algorithms is justified.
Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate our method's effectiveness in
reducing the false-positive rate while increasing statistical power, detection
replicability, and spatial specificity. We apply our approach to reveal: (i)

bound. Such algorithmic results are rarely seen in the literature.
  Multiprocessor scheduling is one of the first combinatorial optimization
problems that have received numerous studies. Recently, several research groups
examined its testing variant, in which each job $J_j$ arrives with an upper
bound $u_j$ on the processing time and a testing operation of length $t_j$; one
can choose to execute $J_j$ for $u_j$ time, or to test $J_j$ for $t_j$ time to
obtain the exact processing time $p_j$ followed by immediately executing the
job for $p_j$ time. Our target problem is the fully online multiprocessor
scheduling with testing, in which the jobs arrive in sequence so that the
testing decision needs to be made at the job arrival as well as the designated
machine. We first use Yao's principle to prove lower bounds of 1.6682 and
1.6522 on the expected competitive ratio for any randomized algorithm at the
presence of at least three machines and only two machines, respectively, and
then propose an expected $(\sqrt{\varphi + 3} + 1) (\approx

distribution over arbitrarily many deterministic algorithms, where $\varphi =
\frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}2$ is the Golden ratio. When there are only two machines, we
show that our randomized algorithm based on two deterministic algorithms is
already expected $\frac{3 \varphi + 3 \sqrt{13 - 7\varphi}}4 (\approx
2.1839)$-competitive, while proving a lower bound of 2.2117 on the competitive

channel-state information at the transmitter (CSIT). However, true reciprocity
only exists in time division duplex (TDD). In this paper, we propose a novel
tracking method that exploits implicit reciprocity in FDD line-of-sight (LOS)
channels as in low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom). This
channel reciprocity, dubbed pseudo-reciprocity, is crucial for applying
multiple-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) to SatCom, which
requires CSIT. We consider an LEO SatCom system where multiple satellites
communicate with a multi-antenna land terminal (LT). In this innovative method,
the LT can track the downlink channel changes and use them to estimate the
uplink channels. The proposed method achieves precoding performance that is
comparable to precoding with full CSIT knowledge. Furthermore, the use of
pseudo reciprocity typically requires only initial CSIT feedback when the
satellite rises. Over very long periods of time, pseudo reciprocity can fail as
a result of phase ambiguity, which is referred to as cycle slip. We thus also
present a closed-form approximation for the expected time until cycle slip,
which indicates that in normal operating conditions, these cycle slips are
extremely rare. Our numerical results provide strong support for the derived
theory.

uncertainty often arises. Existing methods to reduce uncertainty typically
focus on iteratively improving specificity in the overall task instruction.
However, uncertainty can arise from multiple sources, such as ambiguity of the
item being judged due to limited context, or disagreements among the
participants due to different perspectives and an under-specified task. A
one-size-fits-all intervention may be ineffective if it is not targeted to the
right source of uncertainty. In this paper we introduce a new workflow,
Judgment Sieve, to reduce uncertainty in tasks involving group judgment in a
targeted manner. By utilizing measurements that separate different sources of
uncertainty during an initial round of judgment elicitation, we can then select
a targeted intervention adding context or deliberation to most effectively
reduce uncertainty on each item being judged. We test our approach on two
tasks: rating word pair similarity and toxicity of online comments, showing
that targeted interventions reduced uncertainty for the most uncertain cases.
In the top 10% of cases, we saw an ambiguity reduction of 21.4% and 25.7%, and
a disagreement reduction of 22.2% and 11.2% for the two tasks respectively. We
also found through a simulation that our targeted approach reduced the average
uncertainty scores for both sources of uncertainty as opposed to uniform
approaches where reductions in average uncertainty from one source came with an
increase for the other.

models which can be used for nonparametric regression and conditional density
estimation and which overcome a key disadvantage of jointly modeling the
response and predictors as a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model: when there
is a large number of predictors, the clusters induced by the DPM will be
overwhelmingly determined by the predictors rather than the response. A
truncation approximation to a DPM allows a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm to
be used rather than a Polya urn sampling algorithm. The blocked Gibbs sampler
offers potential improvement in mixing. The truncation approximation also
allows for implementation in standard software ($\textit{rjags}$ and
$\textit{rstan}$). In this paper we introduce an analogous truncation
approximation for an EDPM. We show that with sufficiently large truncation
values in the approximation of the EDP prior, a precise approximation to the
EDP is available. We verify that the truncation approximation and blocked Gibbs
sampler with minimum truncation values that obtain adequate error bounds
achieve similar accuracy to the truncation approximation and blocked Gibbs
sampler with large truncation values using a simulated example. Further, we use
the simulated example to show that the blocked Gibbs sampler improves upon the
mixing in the Polya urn sampler, especially as the number of covariates
increases.

liquid phase (0.01 S/cm), is predicted to be possible through couplings between
the mobile ion and the phonon vibrations of the crystal lattice. However, few
experimental techniques have directly probed the many-body phonon modes that
enable superionic conductivity. In this work, we develop a laser-driven
impedance technique to measure the relative contribution of specific phonon
modes to ion migration in a solid-state electrolyte Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO).
Through ab initio calculations, we find that a few collective phonon-ion modes,
mostly TiO6 rocking modes in the <6 Terahertz (THz) range, provide more than
40% of the energy required for the ion hop in the LLTO lattice. Next, we
experimentally measure the change in impedance of LLTO using electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) while driving the TiO6 octahedral rocking modes
with THz radiation. In agreement with our ab initio theoretical calculations
and molecular dynamics simulations, experimentally exciting these rocking modes
decreases the measured impedance ten-fold compared to exciting the acoustic and
optical phonon bath at similar populations or heating LLTO. The decreased
impedance also persists longer than the driving light. Our newly developed
experiments can quantify phonon-ion coupling in multiple classes of ion
conductors and suggest the potential for metastable states for opto-ionic

non-supersymmetric Wilson loops, which turn out to be two and to include an
R-symmetry preserving coupling to the scalar fields of the theory, contrary to
their four-dimensional counterpart defined solely in terms of the gauge field
holonomy. We then deform these operators by turning on bosonic and/or fermionic

is the different behavior of the two ordinary Wilson loops, of which one turns
out to be a UV unstable point while the other is IR stable. The same is true

Prior works mainly designed specific controllers to account for the added
payload and inertia from a manipulator. In contrast, biological systems
typically benefit from additional limbs, which can simplify postural control.
For instance, cats use their tails to enhance the stability of their bodies and
prevent falls under disturbances. In this work, we show that a manipulator can
be an important asset for maintaining balance during locomotion. To do so, we
train a sensorimotor policy using deep reinforcement learning to create a
synergy between the robot's limbs. This policy enables the robot to maintain
stability despite large disturbances. However, learning such a controller can
be quite challenging. To account for these challenges, we propose a stage-wise
training procedure to learn complex behaviors. Our proposed method decomposes
this complex task into three stages and then incrementally learns these tasks
to arrive at a single policy capable of solving the final control task,
achieving a success rate up to 2.35 times higher than baselines in simulation.
We deploy our learned policy in the real world and show stability during

facts and evaluating whether the model learns these facts while not changing
predictions on other contexts. We take a step forward and study LMs' abilities
to make inferences based on injected facts (or propagate those facts): for
example, after learning that something is a TV show, does an LM predict that
you can watch it? We study this with two cloze-style tasks: an existing dataset
of real-world sentences about novel entities (ECBD) as well as a new controlled
benchmark with manually designed templates requiring varying levels of
inference about injected knowledge. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods
for updating knowledge (gradient-based fine-tuning and modifications of this

performance on cloze instances only when there is lexical overlap between
injected facts and target inferences. Yet, prepending entity definitions in an
LM's context improves performance across all settings, suggesting that there is

break or conserve the Poincare (translation) symmetry. And the very same cutoff

perform a systematic study of the UV cutoff in regard to its gauge and Poincare
properties, and construct UV completions restoring the broken gauge symmetry.
In the case of Poincare-conserving UV cutoff, we find that the gauge symmetry
gets restored via the Higgs mechanism. In the case of Poincare-breaking UV
cutoff, however, we find that the flat spacetime affine curvature takes the
place of the Higgs field and, when taken to curved spacetime, gauge symmetry
gets restored at the extremum of the metric-affine action. We also find that
gravity emerges at the extremum if the QFT under concern consists of new
particles beyond the known ones. The resulting emergent gravity plus
renormalized QFT setup has the potential to reveal itself in various
astrophysical, cosmological and collider phenomena.

into a sequence of elementary gates. It is (depth-)optimal if it is impossible
to achieve the desired functionality with even shorter circuits. Optimal
synthesis is a central problem in both quantum and classical hardware design,
but also plagued by complexity-theoretic obstacles. Motivated by fault-tolerant
quantum computation, we consider the special case of synthesizing blocks of
Clifford unitaries. Leveraging entangling input stimuli and the stabilizer
formalism allows us to reduce the Clifford synthesis problem to a family of
poly-size satisfiability (SAT) problems -- one for each target circuit depth.
On a conceptual level, our result showcases that the Clifford synthesis problem
is contained in the first level of the polynomial hierarchy ($\mathsf{NP}$),
while the classical synthesis problem for logical circuits is known to be
complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy
($\Sigma_2^{\mathsf{P}}$). Based on this theoretical reduction, we formulate a
SAT encoding for depth-optimal Clifford synthesis. We then employ SAT solvers
to determine a satisfying assignment or to prove that no such assignment
exists. From that, the shortest depth for which synthesis is still possible
(optimality) as well as the actual circuit (synthesis) can be obtained.
Empirical evaluations show that the optimal synthesis approach yields a
substantial depth improvement for random Clifford circuits and Clifford+T
circuits for Grover search.

density below which the stream is unstable and is not self-gravitating; this
critical density is a factor of at least 40-50 smaller than the stream density

confines the stream, the oscillation period is exponentially long, and the
growth rate of the overstability scales as $t^{1/6}$. The power-law growth and
small power-law index of the overstability implies that the stream is
effectively stable to cylindrically symmetric perturbations. We also use this

the H alpha emission from multidimensional accretion onto a gas giant,
following the gas flow from Hill-sphere scales down to the circumplanetary disc
(CPD) and the planetary surface. We perform azimuthally-symmetric
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations around the planet and use modern tabulated
gas and dust opacities. Crucially, contrasting with most previous simulations,
we do not smooth the gravitational potential and do follow the flow down to the
planetary surface, where grid cells are 0.01 Jupiter radii small radially. We
find that only roughly one percent of the net gas inflow into the Hill sphere
reaches directly the planet. As expected for ballistic infall trajectories,
most of the gas falls at too large a distance on the CPD to generate H alpha.
Including radiation transport removes the high-velocity sub-surface flow
previously seen in hydrodynamics-only simulations, so that only the free planet
surface and the inner regions of the CPD emit substantially H alpha. Unless
magnetospheric accretion, which we neglect here, additionally produces H alpha,
the corresponding H alpha production efficiency is much smaller than usually
assumed, which needs to be taken into account when analysing (non-)detection

slow-fast dynamics with a broad separation of timescales. A systematic analysis

three symmetries that characterize the strongest resonances responsible for the

the disk to the BH inflate and reconnect a few gravitational radii above the
disk. Particles accelerate and accumulate in a few rotating macroscopic flux
ropes. Once flux ropes detach, they propagate in the current layer following
what appears as a rapidly opening spiral when seen face-on. A single flux rope
carries enough relativistic particles to emit synchrotron radiation at levels
suitable to reproduce the flares' peak-luminosity of Sgr A* but it quickly
fades away as it flows away. Our kinematic analysis of flux ropes' motion
favors a BH spin of 0.65 to 0.8 for Sgr A*. The flares' duration require that
the underlying magnetic loop seeded in the disk mid-plane has a finite lifetime
and azimuthal extent. In this scenario, the hot spot corresponds to a spinning
arc along which multiple reconnection sites power the net emission as flux
ropes episodically detach.

certain parity-violating component of the torsion enhance the power in the
large physical length scales, which can have important observational
implications. On the other hand, in the case of bouncing models, the power
spectrum is characterized by an initial region of growth, an intermediate
oscillatory region, and then again a final region of growth. The shape of the

new eV-scale bosons interacting with neutrinos, as these particles can
thermalize with neutrinos via the inverse decay process, $\nu\bar{\nu}
\rightarrow X$, and suppress neutrino free streaming near recombination -- even
for couplings as small as $\lambda_\nu \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-13})$. Here, we
revisit CMB constraints on such bosons, improving upon a number of
approximations previously adopted in the literature and generalizing the
constraints to a broader class of models. This includes scenarios in which the
boson is either spin-$0$ or spin-$1$, the number of interacting neutrinos is
either $N_{\rm int} = 1,2 $ or $3$, and the case in which a primordial
abundance of the species is present. We apply these bounds to well-motivated
models, such as the singlet majoron model or a light $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$
gauge boson, and find that they represent the leading constraints for masses
$m_X\sim 1\, {\rm eV}$. Finally, we revisit the extent to which neutrino-philic
bosons can ameliorate the Hubble tension, and find that recent improvements in
the understanding of how such bosons damp neutrino free streaming reduces the

occur in brittle as well as in ductile regimes. Modeling of shear zones is
essential in the geodynamic framework. Numerical modeling of strain
localization remains challenging due to the non-linearity and multi-scale

allows modeling both the compressible and incompressible visco-elasto-plastic

  Evaluation of Phenotyping Algorithms",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  $\textbf{Objective:}$ High-throughput phenotyping will accelerate the use of
electronic health records (EHRs) for translational research. A critical
roadblock is the extensive medical supervision required for phenotyping
algorithm (PA) estimation and evaluation. To address this challenge, numerous
weakly-supervised learning methods have been proposed to estimate PAs. However,
there is a paucity of methods for reliably evaluating the predictive
performance of PAs when a very small proportion of the data is labeled. To fill
this gap, we introduce a semi-supervised approach (ssROC) for estimation of the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) parameters of PAs (e.g., sensitivity,
specificity).
  $\textbf{Materials and Methods:}$ ssROC uses a small labeled dataset to
nonparametrically impute missing labels. The imputations are then used for ROC
parameter estimation to yield more precise estimates of PA performance relative
to classical supervised ROC analysis (supROC) using only labeled data. We
evaluated ssROC through in-depth simulation studies and an extensive evaluation
of eight PAs from Mass General Brigham.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ In both simulated and real data, ssROC produced ROC
parameter estimates with significantly lower variance than supROC for a given
amount of labeled data. For the eight PAs, our results illustrate that ssROC
achieves similar precision to supROC, but with approximately 60% of the amount
of labeled data on average.
  $\textbf{Discussion:}$ ssROC enables precise evaluation of PA performance to
increase trust in observational health research without demanding large volumes
of labeled data. ssROC is also easily implementable in open-source $\texttt{R}$
software.
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ When used in conjunction with weakly-supervised PAs,
ssROC facilitates the reliable and streamlined phenotyping necessary for
EHR-based research.

Continued Pre-training (PCP), which combines the idea of instruction tuning

performance of prompt-based FT by presenting both task-related texts and prompt
templates to LMs through unsupervised pre-training objectives before
fine-tuning for the target task. Our empirical evaluations on 21 benchmarks
demonstrate that the PCP consistently improves the performance of
state-of-the-art prompt-based FT approaches (up to 20.1% absolute) in both

$G$ such that any two edges sharing an endpoint receive different colors. By
Vizing's celebrated theorem, any graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ needs at
least $\Delta$ and at most $(\Delta + 1)$ colors to be properly edge colored.
In this paper, we study edge colorings in the streaming setting. The edges
arrive one by one in an arbitrary order. The algorithm takes a single pass over
the input and must output a solution using a much smaller space than the input
size. Since the output of edge coloring is as large as its input, the assigned
colors should also be reported in a streaming fashion.
  The streaming edge coloring problem has been studied in a series of works
over the past few years. The main challenge is that the algorithm cannot
""remember"" all the color assignments that it returns. To ensure the validity of
the solution, existing algorithms use many more colors than Vizing's bound.
Namely, in $n$-vertex graphs, the state-of-the-art algorithm with
$\widetilde{O}(n s)$ space requires $O(\Delta^2/s + \Delta)$ colors. Note, in
particular, that for an asymptotically optimal $O(\Delta)$ coloring, this
algorithm requires $\Omega(n\Delta)$ space which is as large as the input.
Whether such a coloring can be achieved with sublinear space has been left
open.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. We present a
randomized algorithm that returns an asymptotically optimal $O(\Delta)$ edge
coloring using $\widetilde{O}(n \sqrt{\Delta})$ space. More generally, our
algorithm returns a proper $O(\Delta^{1.5}/s + \Delta)$ edge coloring with
$\widetilde{O}(n s)$ space, improving prior algorithms for the whole range of

to emerge in the search for answers involves new physics at mass scales

phenomenon of the disk mass assembly believed to be driven by external

makes it possible to reveal the source of external accretion and establish the
details of this process. In this paper, we investigate the galaxy PGC 66551
(MaNGA ID~1-179561) which hosts two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks
suspected in the SDSS MaNGA data and then confirmed using deep follow-up
spectroscopy with the 10-m Southern African Large Telescope. We measured
properties of ionized gas and stellar populations of both counter-rotating
disks in PGC 66551. We found that the counter-rotating disk is compact,
contains young stars with subsolar metallicity, and has a stellar mass
$5\times10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ which amounts to $\approx$20\% of the galaxy's total.
Surprisingly, the main 8 Gyr old disk has a significantly lower metallicity
-0.8 dex than other counter-rotating galaxies. We developed a simple analytic
model for the metal enrichment history, which we applied to PGC 66551 and
constrained the parameters of the galactic outflow wind and estimated the
metallicity of the infalling gas that formed the counter-rotating disk to be
$-0.9 ... -0.5$ dex. Our interpretation prefers a merger with gas-rich
satellite over cold accretion from a cosmic filament as a source of gas, which
then formed the counter-rotating disk in PGC 66551.

to the extreme size of DES data, identifying these objects among many millions
of other celestial objects is a challenging task. The problem of outlier
detection is further magnified by the presence of noisy or saturated images.
When the number of tested objects is extremely high, even a small rate of noise
or false positives leads to a very large number of false detections, making an
automatic system impractical. This study applies an automatic method for
automatic detection of outlier objects in the first data release of the Dark
Energy Survey. By using machine learning-based outlier detection, the algorithm
is able to identify objects that are visually different from the majority of
the other objects in the database. An important feature of the algorithm is
that it allows to control the false-positive rate, and therefore can be used
for practical outlier detection. The algorithm does not provide perfect
accuracy in the detection of outlier objects, but it reduces the data
substantially to allow practical outlier detection. For instance, the selection
of the top 250 objects after applying the algorithm to more than $2\cdot10^6$
DES images provides a collection of uncommon galaxies. Such collection would
have been extremely time-consuming to compile by using manual inspection of the

to suggest an exotic decay channel for the neutron into scalar DM and an SM

$1\%$, a long-standing discrepancy in the measured neutron lifetime between two
different experimental methods, bottle and beam experiments, can be solved. The
mass of the scalar DM produced from neutron decay should be in a narrow range
and as a result, its production in the early universe is challenging. We
discuss that the freeze-in mechanism can produce this scalar DM in the early
universe with the correct relic abundance. Then we show that the model can

  radiotherapy I. Cellular dose enhancement in microscopic models",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: The introduction of Gold NanoParticles (GNPs) in radiotherapy
requires consideration of GNP size, location, and quantity, and more, as well
as beam quality. The work is presented in two parts, with Part I (this work)
investigating accurate and efficient MC modeling to calculate nucleus and
cytoplasm Dose Enhancement Factors (n,cDEFs). Part II then evaluates cell dose
enhancement factors across macroscopic length scales. Methods: Different
methods of modeling gold within cells are compared: a contiguous volume of
either pure gold or gold-tissue mixture or discrete GNPs. MC simulations with
EGSnrc are performed to calculate n,cDEF for a cell considering 10 to 370 keV
incident photons, gold concentrations from 4 to 24~mg of gold per gram, and
three different GNP configurations: GNPs distributed around the surface of the
nucleus or packed into one or four endosomes. Results: n,cDEFs are sensitive to
the model of gold in the cell, with differences of up to 17% observed between
models. Across cell/nucleus radii, source energies, and gold concentrations,
n,cDEF are highest for GNPs in the perinuclear configuration, compared with
GNPs in endosomes. Across all simulations of the default cell, nDEFs and cDEFs
range from one to 6.83 and 3.87, respectively. If the cell size is changed,
much higher n,cDEFs are observed. n,cDEF are maximized at photon energies at or
just above the K- or L-edges of gold. Conclusions: This work demonstrates many
physics trends on DEFs at the cellular level, including that cellular DEFs are
sensitive to gold modeling approach, GNP configuration, cell/nucleus size, gold
concentration, and incident source energy. These data will allow one to
optimize or estimate DEF using not only GNP uptake, but account for incident
photon energy and intracellular configuration of GNPs. Part II will expand the
investigation, applying the cell model in cm-scale phantoms.

assess variations in nucleus and cytoplasm dose enhancement factors (n,cDEFs)
over tumor-scale volumes. Methods: The intrinsic variation of n,cDEFs (due to
variations in local gold concentration and cell/nucleus size) are estimated via
MC modeling of varied cellular GNP uptake and cell/nucleus sizes. Then, a
Heterogeneous MultiScale (HetMS) model is implemented by combining detailed
models of populations of cells containing GNPs with simplified tissue models to
evaluate n,cDEFs. Simulations of tumors with spatially-uniform and -varying
gold concentrations are performed to determine n,cDEFs as a function of
distance from the source. All simulations are performed for three different GNP
configurations: GNPs distributed around the nucleus or packed into one or four
endosome(s). Results: Intrinsic variations in n,cDEFs can be substantial with
changes in GNP uptake and cell/nucleus radii. In HetMS models of tumors,
sub-unity n,cDEFs (dose decreases) can occur for low energies and high gold
concentrations due to attenuation of primary photons through the gold. In HetMS
simulations of tumors with spatially-uniform gold concentrations, n,cDEFs
decrease with depth into the tumor as photons are attenuated, with relative
differences between GNP models remaining approximately constant with depth in
the tumor. Similar initial n,cDEF decreases with radius are seen in tumors with
spatially-varying gold concentrations, but n,cDEFs for all configurations
converge to a single value for each energy as gold concentration reaches zero.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that cellular doses are highly sensitive
to cell/nucleus size, GNP intracellular distribution, gold concentration, and
cell position in the tumor. This work demonstrates the importance of proper
choice of computational model when simulating GNPT scenarios.

immunology and public health. Population heterogeneities in underlying
(pre-vaccination) susceptibility and vaccine response can cause measured
vaccine effectiveness (mVE) to change over time even in the absence of pathogen
evolution and any actual waning of immune responses. We use a multi-scale
agent-based models parameterized using epidemiological and immunological data,
to investigate the effect of these heterogeneities on mVE as measured by the
hazard ratio. Based on our previous work, we consider waning of antibodies
according to a power law and link it to protection in two ways: 1) motivated by
correlates of risk data and 2) using a within-host model of stochastic viral
extinction. The effect of the heterogeneities is given by concise and
understandable formulas, one of which is essentially a generalization of
Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to include higher
derivatives. Heterogeneity in underlying susceptibility accelerates apparent
waning, whereas heterogeneity in vaccine response slows down apparent waning.
Our models suggest that heterogeneity in underlying susceptibility is likely to
dominate. However, heterogeneity in vaccine response offsets <10% to >100%
(median of 29%) of this effect in our simulations. Our methodology and results
may be helpful in understanding competing heterogeneities and waning of
immunity and vaccine-induced protection. Our study suggests heterogeneity is
more likely to 'bias' mVE downwards towards faster waning of immunity but a
subtle bias in the opposite direction is also plausible.

focus on the negative mobility phenomenon in which the average velocity of the

that in the weak dissipation regime thermal fluctuations induce negative
mobility much more frequently than it happens if the dissipation is stronger.
In particular, for the very first time we report a parameter set in which
thermal noise causes this effect in the nonlinear response regime. Moreover, we
show that the coexistence of deterministic negative mobility and chaos is
routinely encountered when approaching the overdamped limit in which chaos does
not emerge rather than near the Hamiltonian regime of which chaos is one of the
hallmarks. On the other hand, at non-zero temperature the negative mobility in
the weak dissipation regime is typically affected by the weak ergodicity
breaking. Our findings can be corroborated experimentally in a multitude of

the pattern formation process. Our large-scale 3D DDD simulations demonstrate
the self-organization of dislocation networks into cell walls in deformed BCC

several crucial aspects of how the dislocation cell pattern affects metal
plasticity, as observed in experiments. Although experimental evidence is
inconclusive regarding whether cell wall formation takes place at the shock

formulation. Following this insight, we demonstrate the full generalisation of
pseudo labels under Bayes' principle, called Bayesian Pseudo Labels. We then
provide a variational approach to learn to approximate Bayesian Pseudo Labels,
by learning a threshold to select good quality pseudo labels. In the rest of
the paper, we demonstrate the applications of Pseudo Labelling and its
generalisation Bayesian Psuedo Labelling in semi-supervised segmentation of
medical images on: 1) 3D binary segmentation of lung vessels from CT volumes;
2) 2D multi class segmentation of brain tumours from MRI volumes; 3) 3D binary

can enhance the robustness of the learnt representations.

to the challenge of generalizing to a wide variety of possible natural language

between different knowledge bases often necessitates specialized training for
different knowledge base question-answering (KBQA) datasets. To handle
questions over diverse KBQA datasets with a unified training-free framework, we
propose KB-BINDER, which for the first time enables few-shot in-context
learning over KBQA tasks. Firstly, KB-BINDER leverages large language models
like Codex to generate logical forms as the draft for a specific question by
imitating a few demonstrations. Secondly, KB-BINDER grounds on the knowledge
base to bind the generated draft to an executable one with BM25 score matching.
The experimental results on four public heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that
KB-BINDER can achieve a strong performance with only a few in-context
demonstrations. Especially on GraphQA and 3-hop MetaQA, KB-BINDER can even
outperform the state-of-the-art trained models. On GrailQA and WebQSP, our
model is also on par with other fully-trained models. We believe KB-BINDER can
serve as an important baseline for future research. Our code is available at

  Power of Many Robots","19 pages, accepted at IPDPS 2023",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the years, much research involving mobile computational entities has
been performed. From modeling actual microscopic (and smaller) robots, to
modeling software processes on a network, many important problems have been
studied in this context. Gathering is one such fundamental problem in this
area. The problem of gathering $k$ robots, initially arbitrarily placed on the
nodes of an $n$-node graph, asks that these robots coordinate and communicate
in a local manner, as opposed to global, to move around the graph, find each
other, and settle down on a single node as fast as possible. A more difficult
problem to solve is gathering with detection, where once the robots gather,
they must subsequently realize that gathering has occurred and then terminate.
  In this paper, we propose a deterministic approach to solve gathering with
detection for any arbitrary connected graph that is faster than existing
deterministic solutions for even just gathering (without the requirement of
detection) for arbitrary graphs. In contrast to earlier work on gathering, it
leverages the fact that there are more robots present in the system to achieve
gathering with detection faster than those previous papers that focused on just
gathering. The state of the art solution for deterministic gathering~[Ta-Shma
and Zwick, TALG, 2014] takes $\Tilde{O}$$(n^5 \log \ell)$ rounds, where $\ell$
is the smallest label among robots and $\Tilde{O}$ hides a polylog factor. We
design a deterministic algorithm for gathering with detection with the
following trade-offs depending on how many robots are present: (i) when $k \geq
\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^3)$ rounds, (ii) when $k
\geq \lfloor n/3 \rfloor + 1$, the algorithm takes $O(n^4 \log n)$ rounds, and
(iii) otherwise, the algorithm takes $\Tilde{O}$$(n^5)$ rounds. The algorithm
is not required to know $k$, but only $n$.

for points far out-of-distribution, making uncertainty quantification (UQ) a
challenge. When they are employed to model interatomic potentials in materials
systems, this problem leads to unphysical structures that disrupt simulations,
or to biased statistics and dynamics that do not reflect the true physics.
Differentiable UQ techniques can find new informative data and drive active
learning loops for robust potentials. However, a variety of UQ techniques,
including newly developed ones, exist for atomistic simulations and there are
no clear guidelines for which are most effective or suitable for a given case.
In this work, we examine multiple UQ schemes for improving the robustness of NN
interatomic potentials (NNIPs) through active learning. In particular, we
compare incumbent ensemble-based methods against strategies that use single,
deterministic NNs: mean-variance estimation, deep evidential regression, and
Gaussian mixture models. We explore three datasets ranging from in-domain
interpolative learning to more extrapolative out-of-domain generalization
challenges: rMD17, ammonia inversion, and bulk silica glass. Performance is
measured across multiple metrics relating model error to uncertainty. Our
experiments show that none of the methods consistently outperformed each other
across the various metrics. Ensembling remained better at generalization and
for NNIP robustness; MVE only proved effective for in-domain interpolation,
while GMM was better out-of-domain; and evidential regression, despite its
promise, was not the preferable alternative in any of the cases. More broadly,
cost-effective, single deterministic models cannot yet consistently match or
outperform ensembling for uncertainty quantification in NNIPs.

connectivity queries in undirected graphs in the presence of vertex failures.
Specifically, given an undirected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges and
an integer $d_{\star}\ll n$, the goal is to preprocess the graph in order to
construct a data structure $\mathcal{D}$ such that, given a set of vertices $F$
with $|F|=d\leq d_{\star}$, we can derive an oracle from $\mathcal{D}$ that can
efficiently answer queries of the form ""is $x$ connected with $y$ in
$G\setminus F$?"". Very recently, Long and Saranurak (FOCS 2022) provided a
solution to this problem that is almost optimal with respect to the
preprocessing time, the space usage, the update time, and the query time.
However, their solution is highly complicated, and it seems very difficult to
be implemented efficiently. Furthermore, it does not settle the complexity of
the problem in the regime where $d_{\star}$ is a constant. Here, we provide a
much simpler solution to this problem, that uses only textbook data structures.
Our algorithm is deterministic, it has preprocessing time and space complexity
$O(d_{\star}m\log n)$, update time $O(d^4 \log n)$, and query time $O(d)$.
These bounds compare very well with the previous best, especially considering
the simplicity of our approach. In fact, if we assume that $d_{\star}$ is a
constant ($d_{\star}\geq 4$), then our algorithm improves on the
state-of-the-art in every respect, except space. Nevertheless, even our space
usage in this case is almost linear. Finally, the data structure that we
provide is flexible with respect to $d_{\star}$: it can be adapted to increases
and decreases, in time and space that are almost proportional to the change in
$d_{\star}$ and the size of the graph.

organisms from infected patients to selected antimicrobial drugs. Antibiograms
help clinicians to understand regional resistance rates and select appropriate
antibiotics in prescriptions. In practice, significant combinations of
antibiotic resistance may appear in different antibiograms, forming antibiogram
patterns. Such patterns may imply the prevalence of some infectious diseases in
certain regions. Thus it is of crucial importance to monitor antibiotic
resistance trends and track the spread of multi-drug resistant organisms. In
this paper, we propose a novel problem of antibiogram pattern prediction that
aims to predict which patterns will appear in the future. Despite its
importance, tackling this problem encounters a series of challenges and has not
yet been explored in the literature. First of all, antibiogram patterns are not
i.i.d as they may have strong relations with each other due to genomic
similarities of the underlying organisms. Second, antibiogram patterns are
often temporally dependent on the ones that are previously detected.
Furthermore, the spread of antibiotic resistance can be significantly
influenced by nearby or similar regions. To address the above challenges, we
propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Antibiogram Pattern Prediction framework,
STAPP, that can effectively leverage the pattern correlations and exploit the
temporal and spatial information. We conduct extensive experiments on a
real-world dataset with antibiogram reports of patients from 1999 to 2012 for
203 cities in the United States. The experimental results show the superiority

potential for designing novel circuits capable of inducing and manipulating

experimental progress towards this hybridization, concrete evidence for a
chiral QH Josephson junction -- the elemental building block for coherent
superconducting-QH circuits -- is still lacking. Its expected signature is an
unusual chiral supercurrent flowing in QH edge channels, which oscillates with
a specific $2\phi_0$ magnetic flux periodicity ($\phi_0=h/2e$ is the
superconducting flux quantum, $h$ the Planck constant and $e$ the electron
charge). Here, we show that ultra-narrow Josephson junctions defined in
encapsulated graphene nanoribbons exhibit such a chiral supercurrent, visible
up to 8 teslas, and carried by the spin-degenerate edge channel of the QH
plateau of resistance $h/2e^2\simeq 12.9$ k$\Omega$. We observe reproducible
$2\phi_0$-periodic oscillation of the supercurrent, which emerges at constant
filling factor when the area of the loop formed by the QH edge channel is
constant, within a magnetic-length correction that we resolve in the data.
Furthermore, by varying the junction geometry, we show that reducing the
superconductor/normal interface length is pivotal to obtain a measurable
supercurrent on QH plateaus, in agreement with theories predicting dephasing
along the superconducting interface. Our findings mark a critical milestone
along the path to explore correlated and fractional QH-based superconducting
devices that should host non-Abelian Majorana and parafermion zero modes.

since they gracefully scale to systems with a varying and high number of
agents. While there has been much progress made for deterministic interacting
systems, modeling is much more challenging for stochastic systems in which one
is interested in obtaining a predictive distribution over future trajectories.
Existing methods are either computationally slow since they rely on Monte Carlo
sampling or make simplifying assumptions such that the predictive distribution
is unimodal. In this work, we present a deep state-space model which employs
graph neural networks in order to model the underlying interacting dynamical
system. The predictive distribution is multimodal and has the form of a
Gaussian mixture model, where the moments of the Gaussian components can be
computed via deterministic moment matching rules. Our moment matching scheme
can be exploited for sample-free inference, leading to more efficient and
stable training compared to Monte Carlo alternatives. Furthermore, we propose
structured approximations to the covariance matrices of the Gaussian components
in order to scale up to systems with many agents. We benchmark our novel
framework on two challenging autonomous driving datasets. Both confirm the
benefits of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further
demonstrate the usefulness of our individual contributions in a carefully
designed ablation study and provide a detailed runtime analysis of our proposed
covariance approximations. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the
generalization ability of our method by evaluating its performance on unseen

Due to coupling between array individuals, the spontaneous oscillation is

method is generalized to handle multivariate covariates on any Riemannian

multivariate ILPR (ILPR-EPM). Asymptotic statistical properties of the ILPR-EPM
for the multivariate local linear case are established, including a formula for
the asymptotic bias, establishing estimator consistency. The paper showcases
possible applications of the method by focusing on a group of Riemannian

machine learning and neuroscience. It is demonstrated that several metrics on
the SPD manifold are EPMs, resulting in a closed analytical expression for the

estimator's performance under two specific EPMs, Log-Cholesky and
Log-Euclidean, on simulated data on the SPD manifold and compares it with
extrinsic LPR using the Affine-Invariant when scaling the manifold and
covariate dimension. The results show that the ILPR using the Log-Cholesky

high on-off ratio of 10^8 and 10^6, a low off-state current of 100 to 300 fA, a
negligible hysteresis, and an ideal subthreshold swing of 62 and 63 mV/dec are
measured in the p- and n-type transport, respectively. For the first time, we
demonstrate cascadable and cascaded logic gates using ambipolar TMD transistors
with minimal static power consumption, including inverters, XOR, NAND, NOR, and
buffers made by cascaded inverters. A thorough study of both the control gate
and polarity gate behavior is conducted, which has previously been lacking. The
noise margin of the logic gates is measured and analyzed. The large noise
margin enables the implementation of VT-drop circuits, a type of logic with
reduced transistor number and simplified circuit design. Finally, the speed
performance of the VT-drop and other circuits built by dual-gate devices are
qualitatively analyzed. This work lays the foundation for future developments
in the field of ambipolar dual-gate TMD transistors, showing their potential
for low-power, high-speed and more flexible logic circuits.

the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints that are imposed on the initial state.
Nevertheless, the quantum theory permits gauge invariant time evolution of
these states. The time evolution of these states is such that at the classical
level the full set of Einstein's equations would appear to hold, with the
physical effects of these states being attributable to an auxiliary,
covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor with no internal degrees of

that a homogeneous and isotropic initial background state contributes to
expansion identical to cold dark matter. The inhomogeneous components of this

This auxiliary contribution to Einstein's equations could have either sign and
thus provide a trivial way to violate the null energy condition, enabling novel

existing evaluations are performed under various inconsistent protocols.
Correspondingly, these replicability issues make it difficult to understand how
much benefit we can actually gain from these neural models. It then becomes
clear that a fair and comprehensive performance comparison between traditional
and neural models is needed.
  Motivated by these issues, we perform a large-scale, systematic study to
compare recent neural recommendation models against traditional ones in top-n
recommendation from implicit data. We propose a set of evaluation strategies
for measuring memorization performance, generalization performance, and
subgroup-specific performance of recommendation models. We conduct extensive
experiments with 13 popular recommendation models (including two neural models

experiments demonstrate that even with extensive hyper-parameter searches,
neural models do not dominate traditional models in all aspects, e.g., they
fare worse in terms of average HitRate. We further find that there are areas
where neural models seem to outperform non-neural models, for example, in
recommendation diversity and robustness between different subgroups of users

neural models in recommendation and is therefore an important step towards

here, we show that VNNs exhibit transferability of performance over datasets

important observations: (i) VNNs can assign anatomical interpretability to
elevated brain age gap in AD, and (ii) the interpretability offered by VNNs is
contingent on their ability to exploit specific principal components of the

Knowledge-Enhanced PLMs (KEPLMs) incorporate the interactions between tokens

entity-centric tasks such as entity linking and relation classification.
Although exploiting Wikipedia's rich structures to some extent, conventional
KEPLMs still neglect a unique layout of the corpus where each Wikipedia page is
around a topic entity (identified by the page URL and shown in the page title).
In this paper, we demonstrate that KEPLMs without incorporating the topic
entities will lead to insufficient entity interaction and biased (relation)
word semantics. We thus propose KEPLET, a novel Knowledge-Enhanced Pre-trained

identifies where to add the topic entity's information in a Wikipedia sentence,
fuses such information into token and mentioned entities representations, and
supervises the network learning, through which it takes topic entities back
into consideration. Experiments demonstrated the generality and superiority of
KEPLET which was applied to two representative KEPLMs, achieving significant
improvements on four entity-centric tasks.

us with a pertinent question 'what to do after abstention'. To this end, we

symplectic transformations (in the $C^\infty$-smooth and real-analytic

the transformations preserve the Hamiltonian of the system. The classification
is obtained by bringing the pair $(H, \omega)$ to a symplectic normal form $$(H

relationship between the rate function and covariates through two indices: the
shape index and the size index. The shape index allows the covariates to
flexibly affect the shape of the rate function, and the size index retains the
interpretability of covariate effects on the magnitude of the rate function. To
overcome the challenges in simultaneously estimating the two sets of
parameters, we propose a conditional pseudolikelihood approach to eliminate the
size parameters in shape estimation and an event count projection approach for
size estimation. The proposed estimators are asymptotically normal with a

modern, resonator-free, highfield electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)

detected EPR (cross-polar) signal is polarized orthogonal to the incident
(co-polar) radiation. The sample holder improves SNR in three modes: continuous
wave, pulsed, and rapid-scan. An adjustable sample positioner allows for
optimizing sample position to maximize the 240 GHz magnetic field B1, and a
rooftop mirror allows for small rotations of the cross-polar signal to maximize
the signal and minimize the co-polar background. When optimized, the co-polar
isolation (the ratio of incident to detected co-polar signal) was around 50 dB,
an improvement of over 20 dB. This large isolation is especially beneficial for
maximizing the SNR of rapidscan EPR, but also improves the SNR in pulsed and
cwEPR experiments. Through minimal modification, the sample holder may be
incorporated into a variety of homebuilt, induction-mode hfEPR spectrometers in
order to significantly improve the SNR (approx. 6x), and thereby reduce the
acquisition time (by more than a factor of 30).

paramount importance to accurately characterize the radio propagation in
diverse scenarios such as urban microcell (UMi), urban macrocell (UMa), rural
macrocell (RMa), indoor hotspot (InH), and indoor factory (InF) for a wide

oversimplified and restricted to the frequency range of 0.5-100 GHz. Thus, to

the drop-based NYU channel model (NYUSIM) for the frequency range of 0.5-150
GHz for the UMi, UMa, RMa, InH, and InF scenarios. NYUSIM allows researchers to
design and evaluate new algorithms and protocols for future sub-THz wireless

the immediate set of problems a chaotic coverage path planner needs to overcome

immediate problems are as follows: (1) an obstacle avoidance technique which
generally maintains the kinematic efficiency of the robot's motion, (2) a means
to spread chaotic trajectories across the environment (especially crucial for
large and/or complex-shaped environments) that need to be covered, and (3) a

produce generally smooth chaotic trajectories and provide high scanning

processes, analyses are optimised by tuning event selections on benchmark
models generated in 2D planes of parameters, with all other parameters held
fixed. Motivated by recent evidence that this removes sensitivity to a large
volume of viable SUSY models, we propose an alternative approach based on
dimensional reduction of global fit results. Starting from the results of a
global fit of the 4D electroweak minimal supersymmetric standard model
performed by the GAMBIT collaboration, we show how to define a 2D plane by
using a variational autoencoder to map points in the original 4D parameter
space to a 2D latent space. This allows for easy visualisation of the 4D global
fit results, which generates insights into what we may be missing at the LHC.
Furthermore, the invertible nature of the map to the 2D plane allows
experimentalists to choose and simulate benchmark models in a 2D plane (as they
could for a simplified model) whilst still accessing the full range of
phenomenological scenarios identified by the global fit in the 4D model. We
provide a demonstration of how our visualisation and benchmark model simulation

literature and validation of spray modelling for industrial applications like
fuel injection in internal combustion and turbine jet engines are available.
However, only a handful of studies, primarily limited to discrete phase
modelling, of low-pressure applications, such as nasal spray exists. This study
aims to provide insight into the external and near-nozzle spray
characterization of a continuous spray and establishes good validation against
the experiment. A 3-dimensional (3D) X-ray scanner was used to extract the
internal nasal spray nozzle geometry which was reconstructed to build a 3D
computational model. A novel volume-of-fluid to discrete phase transition model
(VOF-DPM) was used to track the liquid phase and its transition to droplets,
which was based on the shape and size of the liquid lumps. In this study, an
early pre-stable and stable phase of spray plume development was investigated.
Qualitative and quantitative analysis were carried out to validate the
computational model. A liquid column exited a nozzle which distorted at its
base with advancement in time and eventually formed a hollow-cone liquid sheet.
It then, disintegrated due to instability that produced fluctuations to form
ligaments resulting in secondary break-up. This study provides in-depth
understanding of liquid jet disintegration and droplet formation, which adds
value to future nasal spray device designs and techniques to facilitate more
effective targeted nasal drug delivery.

vulnerabilities in neural ranking models (NRMs), but current attack methods
often introduce grammatical errors, nonsensical expressions, or incoherent text
fragments, which can be easily detected. Additionally, current methods rely
heavily on the use of a well-imitated surrogate NRM to guarantee the attack
effect, which makes them difficult to use in practice. To address these issues,
we propose a framework called Imperceptible DocumEnt Manipulation (IDEM) to
produce adversarial documents that are less noticeable to both algorithms and
humans. IDEM instructs a well-established generative language model, such as
BART, to generate connection sentences without introducing easy-to-detect
errors, and employs a separate position-wise merging strategy to balance
relevance and coherence of the perturbed text. Experimental results on the
popular MS MARCO benchmark demonstrate that IDEM can outperform strong
baselines while preserving fluency and correctness of the target documents as
evidenced by automatic and human evaluations. Furthermore, the separation of
adversarial text generation from the surrogate NRM makes IDEM more robust and
less affected by the quality of the surrogate NRM.

the inner parts by convection, reaching regions even somewhat below the
convection zone, by non-standard transport mechanisms. In stars with deeper
convective zones, this element can reach regions with temperatures sufficient
enough to be destroyed, implying in a lower Li content. More metallic stars
show a deepening of their convective zones, so they could deplete more Li in
comparison with stars of lower metallicity. In order to verify this effect and
its amplitude, we selected stars with ~1 M$_{\odot}$ and metallicities within a
factor of two relative to the Sun. We studied a sample of 41 metal-rich and
-poor solar analogues, and carried out a joint analysis with a sample of 77
solar twins from our previous work, resulting in a total sample of 118 stars
covering the metallicity range -0.3 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ +0.3 dex. We employed
high-resolution (R = 115 000) and high-signal-to-noise ratio (S/N = 400-1000)
HARPS spectra and determined the atmospheric parameters using a line-by-line
differential analysis and the Li abundance through spectral synthesis. The ages

We also investigated the impact of planets on Li. We found robust
anticorrelations between Li abundance and both metallicity and age, with a
significance above 10$\sigma$ in both cases. Our results agree qualitatively
with theoretical predictions and are useful to constrain non-standard models of
Li depletion, and to better understand transport and mixing mechanisms inside

with unprecedented brightness
($10^{20}\sim10^{21}~\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{m}^2/\mathrm{rad}^2$) and $0.1\sim 1$
MeV energy spread can be produced through controlled injection in a slowly
expanding bubble that arises when a particle beam or laser pulse propagates in
density gradient, or when a particle beam self-focuses in uniform plasma or has
a superluminal flying focus. However, in previous simulations of work on
self-injection triggered by an evolving laser driver in a uniform plasma, the
resulting beams did not exhibit comparable brightnesses and energy spreads.
Here, we demonstrate through the use of large-scale high-fidelity PIC
simulations that a slowly expanding bubble driven by a laser pulse in a uniform
plasma can indeed produce self-injected electron beams with similar
brightnesses and energy spreads as for an evolving bubble driven by an electron
beam driver. We consider laser spot sizes roughly equal to the matched spot
sizes in a uniform plasma and find that the evolution of the bubble occurs
naturally through the evolution of the laser. The effects of the electron beam
quality on the choice of physical as well as numerical parameters, e.g. grid
sizes and field solvers used in the PIC simulations are presented. It is found
that this original and simplest injection scheme can produce electron beams
with beam quality exceeding that of the more recent concepts.

an efficient sharding simulator. Built upon this pre-trained cost model, we
then perform an online search to identify the best sharding plans given any

recommendation models (DLRMs) and propose NeuroShard for embedding table
sharding. NeuroShard pre-trains neural cost models on augmented tables to cover
various sharding scenarios. Then it identifies the best column-wise and
table-wise sharding plans with beam search and greedy grid search,
respectively. Experiments show that NeuroShard significantly and consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art on the benchmark sharding dataset, achieving
up to 23.8% improvement. When deployed in an ultra-large production DLRM with
multi-terabyte embedding tables, NeuroShard achieves 11.6% improvement in

hand we want our autonomous vehicles (AVs) to be safe, while at the same time
their performance (e.g., comfort or progression) is key to adoption. To
effectively walk the tight-rope between safety and performance, AVs need to be
risk-averse, but not entirely risk-avoidant. To facilitate safe-yet-performant
driving, in this paper, we develop a task-aware risk estimator that assesses
the risk a perception failure poses to the AV's motion plan. If the failure has
no bearing on the safety of the AV's motion plan, then regardless of how
egregious the perception failure is, our task-aware risk estimator considers
the failure to have a low risk; on the other hand, if a seemingly benign
perception failure severely impacts the motion plan, then our estimator
considers it to have a high risk. In this paper, we propose a task-aware risk
estimator to decide whether a safety maneuver needs to be triggered. To
estimate the task-aware risk, first, we leverage the perception failure -
detected by a perception monitor - to synthesize an alternative plausible model
for the vehicle's surroundings. The risk due to the perception failure is then
formalized as the ""relative"" risk to the AV's motion plan between the perceived
and the alternative plausible scenario. We employ a statistical tool called
copula, which models tail dependencies between distributions, to estimate this
risk. The theoretical properties of the copula allow us to compute probably
approximately correct (PAC) estimates of the risk. We evaluate our task-aware
risk estimator using NuPlan and compare it with established baselines, showing
that the proposed risk estimator achieves the best F1-score (doubling the score

weakly-attenuating materials, such as breast and brain tissue, but has yet to
be widely implemented clinically due to high coherence requirements and
expensive x-ray optics. Speckle-based phase contrast imaging has been proposed
as an affordable and simple alternative; however, obtaining high-quality
phase-contrast images requires accurate tracking of sample-induced speckle
pattern modulations. This study introduced a convolutional neural network to
accurately retrieve sub-pixel displacement fields from pairs of reference
(i.e., without sample) and sample images for speckle tracking. Speckle patterns
were generated utilizing an in-house wave-optical simulation tool. These images
were then randomly deformed and attenuated to generate training and testing
datasets. The performance of the model was evaluated and compared against
conventional speckle tracking algorithms: zero-normalized cross-correlation and
unified modulated pattern analysis. We demonstrate improved accuracy (1.7 times
better than conventional speckle tracking), bias (2.6 times), and spatial
resolution (2.3 times), as well as noise robustness, window size independence,
and computational efficiency. In addition, the model was validated with a
simulated geometric phantom. Thus, in this study, we propose a novel
convolutional-neural-network-based speckle-tracking method with enhanced
performance and robustness that offers improved alternative tracking while
further expanding the potential applications of speckle-based phase contrast

these resonators to measure the surface dielectric, conductor, and seam losses

are affected by chemical etching, diamond turning, and thin-film coating. We
find that chemical etching and diamond turning reduce both the surface

appreciable improvement to the seam. Coating the surfaces of diamond-turned
aluminum alloys with e-beam evaporated or sputtered aluminum thin-films
significantly reduces all three losses under study. In addition, we study the

a fundamental problem in various fields such as physics, applied mathematics,

exponential growth of the state space as the system size increases. Many
standard methods have significant weaknesses. For instance, message-passing
algorithms can be inaccurate and even fail to converge due to short loops. At
the same time, tensor network methods can have exponential computational
complexity in large graphs due to long loops. This work proposes a new method
called ``tensor network message passing.'' This approach allows us to compute
local observables like marginal probabilities and correlations by combining the
strengths of tensor networks in contracting small sub-graphs with many short
loops and the strengths of message-passing methods in globally sparse graphs,
thus addressing the crucial weaknesses of both approaches. Our algorithm is
exact for systems that are globally tree-like and locally dense-connected when
the dense local graphs have limited treewidth. We have conducted numerical
experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs to compute magnetizations of
Ising models and spin glasses, to demonstrate the superiority of our approach

combine to form structures and, by their design and the dynamics of the system,
are forced to follow the execution of algorithms. Motivated by applications in
DNA-nanotechnology, investigations in algorithmic tile-based self-assembly have
blossomed into a mature theory with research leveraging tools from
computability theory, complexity theory, information theory, and graph theory
to develop a wide range of models and show that many are computationally
universal, while also exposing powers and limitations of each. Beyond
computational universality, the abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) was shown
to be intrinsically universal (IU), a strong notion of completeness where a
single tile set is capable of simulating all systems within the model; however,
this result required non-deterministic tile attachments. This was later
confirmed necessary when it was shown that the class of directed aTAM systems
is not IU. Building on these results to further investigate the impacts of
other dynamics, Hader et al. examined several tile-assembly models which varied
across (1) the numbers of dimensions used, (2) restrictions based on diffusion
of tiles through space, and (3) whether each system is directed, and showed
which models are IU. Such results have shed much light on the roles of various
aspects of the dynamics of tile-assembly and their effects on the intrinsic
universality of each model. Here we provide direct comparisons of the various
models by considering intrinsic simulations between models. We show that in
some cases one model is more powerful than another, and in others, pairs of
models have mutually exclusive capabilities. This comparison helps to expose
the impacts of these three important aspects and further helps define a
hierarchy of tile-assembly models.

concerning, there is little guarantee that the generated rationales are
consistent with LM's predictions or faithfully justify the decisions. In this
work, we propose a faithful knowledge distillation method to learn a small,
self-consistent CoT model from a teacher model that is orders of magnitude
larger. To form better supervision, we elicit rationales supporting the gold
answers from a large LM (teacher) by contrastive decoding, which encourages the
teacher to generate tokens that become more plausible only when the answer is
considered. To ensure faithful distillation, we use the teacher-generated
rationales to learn a student LM with a counterfactual reasoning objective,
which prevents the student from ignoring the rationales to make inconsistent
predictions. Experiments show that, while yielding comparable end-task
performance, our method can generate CoT rationales that are more faithful than
baselines do. Further analysis suggests that such a model respects the
rationales more when making decisions; thus, we can improve its performance
more by refining its rationales.

cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. However, sound auscultation is
challenging due to noise. In this study, a modified version of the affine
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approach is proposed to blindly
separate lung and heart sounds recorded by a digital stethoscope. This method
applies a novel NMF algorithm, which embodies a parallel structure of
multilayer units on the input signal, to find a proper estimation of source
signals. Another key innovation is the use of the periodic property of the
signals which improves accuracy compared to previous works. The method is
tested on 100 cases. Each case consists of two synthesized mixtures of real
measurements. The effect of different parameters is discussed, and the results
are compared to other current methods. Results demonstrate improvements in the
source-to-distortion ratio (SDR), source-to-interference ratio (SIR), and
source-to-artifacts ratio (SAR) of heart and lung sounds, respectively.

deployment in the cloud and at the edge. However, especially at the edge, there
is a mismatch between the traditional focus on NFV throughput and the need to
meet very low latency SLOs, as edge services inherently require low latency.
Moreover, cloud-based NFV systems need to achieve such low latency while
minimizing CPU core usage.
  We find that real-world traffic exhibits burstiness that causes latency
spikes of up to 10s of milliseconds in existing NFV systems. To address this,
we built NetBlaze, which achieves sub-millisecond p99 latency SLOs, even for
adversarial traffic, using a novel multi-scale core-scaling strategy. NetBlaze
makes traffic-to-core allocation decisions at rack, server, and core-spatial
scales, and at increasingly finer timescales, to accommodate multi-timescale
bursts. In comparison with state-of-the-art approaches, NetBlaze is the only
one capable of achieving sub-millisecond p99 latency SLOs while using a

novel on-chip charge detector output stage for charge-coupled device (CCD)
image sensors, developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This technology uses a
p-MOSFET transistor with a depleted internal gate beneath the transistor
channel. The transistor source-drain current is modulated by the transfer of
charge into the internal gate. RNDR was realized by transferring the signal
charge non-destructively between the internal gate and the summing well (SW),
which is the last serial register. The advantage of the non-destructive charge
transfer is that the signal charge for each pixel can be measured at the end of
each transfer cycle and by averaging for a large number of measurements
($\mathrm{N_{cycle}}$), the total noise can be reduced by a factor of
1/$\mathrm{\sqrt{N_{cycle}}}$. In our experiments with a prototype SiSeRO
device, we implemented nine ($\mathrm{N_{cycle}}$ = 9) RNDR cycles, achieving
around 2 electron readout noise (equivalent noise charge or ENC) with spectral
resolution close to the fano limit for silicon at 5.9 keV. These first results
are extremely encouraging, demonstrating successful implementation of the RNDR
technique in SiSeROs. They also lay foundation for future experiments with more
optimized test stands (better temperature control, larger number of RNDR
cycles, RNDR-optimized SiSeRO devices) which should be capable of achieving
sub-electron noise sensitivities. This new device class presents an exciting
technology for next generation astronomical X-ray telescopes requiring very

probe interstellar and circumstellar magnetic fields, because aspherical grains
tend to align themselves with magnetic field lines. While the Radiative
Alignment Torque (RAT) mechanism provides a theoretical framework to this
phenomenon, some aspects of this alignment mechanism still need to be
quantitatively tested. One such aspect is the possibility that the reference
alignment direction changes from the magnetic field (""B-RAT"") to the radiation
field k-vector (""k-RAT"") in areas of strong radiation fields. We investigate
this transition toward the Orion Bar PDR, using multi-wavelength SOFIA HAWC+
dust polarization observations. The polarization angle maps show that the
radiation field direction is on average not the preferred grain alignment axis.
We constrain the grain sizes for which the transition from B-RAT to k-RAT occur
in the Orion Bar (grains > 0.1 {\mu}m toward the most irradiated locations),
and explore the radiatively driven rotational disruption that may take place in
the high-radiation environment of the Bar for large grains. While the grains
susceptible to rotational disruption should be in supra-thermal rotation and
aligned with the magnetic field, k-RAT aligned grains would rotate at thermal
velocities. We find that the grain size at which the alignment shifts from
B-RAT to k-RAT corresponds to grains too large to survive the rotational
disruption. Therefore, we expect a large fraction of grains to be aligned at
supra-thermal rotation with the magnetic field, and potentially be subject to
rotational disruption depending on their tensile strength.

Knowledge in chemical reactions to assist Molecular property prediction.
Specifically, the reaction-to-molecule distillation model within MolKD
transfers cross-modal knowledge from a pre-trained teacher network learning
with one modality (i.e., reactions) into a student network learning with
another modality (i.e., molecules). Moreover, MolKD learns effective molecular

efficiency of the reactant-product pair when pre-training on reactions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MolKD significantly outperforms various
competitive baseline models, e.g., 2.1% absolute AUC-ROC gain on Tox21. Further

can distinguish chemically reasonable molecular similarities, which enables

Transformation Telling (VTT). This task requires a machine to describe the
transformation that occurred between every two adjacent states (i.e. images) in
a series. Unlike most existing visual reasoning tasks that focus on state
reasoning, VTT emphasizes transformation reasoning. We collected 13,547 samples
from two instructional video datasets, CrossTask and COIN, and extracted
desired states and transformation descriptions to create a suitable VTT
benchmark dataset. Humans can naturally reason from superficial states
differences (e.g. ground wetness) to transformations descriptions (e.g.
raining) according to their life experience but how to model this process to
bridge this semantic gap is challenging. We designed TTNet on top of existing
visual storytelling models by enhancing the model's state-difference
sensitivity and transformation-context awareness. TTNet significantly
outperforms other baseline models adapted from similar tasks, such as visual
storytelling and dense video captioning, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
modeling on transformations. Through comprehensive diagnostic analyses, we
found TTNet has strong context utilization abilities, but even with some
state-of-the-art techniques such as CLIP, there remain challenges in
generalization that need to be further explored.

the X-ray analysis domain, introducing two complementary novelties. Firstly,
more efficient anchors are obtained by hierarchical clustering the sizes of the
ground-truth training set bounding boxes; thus, the resulting anchors follow a
natural hierarchy aligned with the semantic structure of the data. Secondly,
the default Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm at the end of the object
detection pipeline is modified to better handle occluded object detection and
to reduce the number of false predictions, by inserting the Efficient
Intersection over Union (E-IoU) metric into the Weighted Cluster NMS method.
E-IoU provides more discriminative geometrical correlations between the
candidate bounding boxes/Regions-of-Interest (RoIs). The proposed method is
implemented on a common single-stage object detector (YOLOv5) and its
experimental evaluation on a relevant public dataset indicates significant
accuracy gains over both the baseline and competing approaches. This highlights

always be represented as the sum of the interaction effects of all interactive

social media achieves that effect is by growing clusters of people and groups
with similar effervescent feelings, which in another case would never be in

as a consequence of the spontaneous and massive interactions, will attain the
growth and divergence of the correlation length, giving rise to important
simplifications on several statistics. In this work, we report the presence of
signs of criticality in social demonstrations. Namely, the same power-law
exponents are found whenever the distributions are calculated, either
considering the same windows-time or the same number of hashtags. The exponents
for the distributions during the event were found to be smaller than before
(and after) the event. The latter also happens whenever the hashtags are
counted only once per user or if all their usages are considered. By means of
network representations, we show that the systems present two kinds of high
correlations, characterised by either high or low values of modularity. The
temporal points of high modularity are characterised by a sustained correlation
while the ones of low modularity are characterised by a punctual correlation.
The importance of analysing systems near a critical point is that any small

computational demands and to ensure the autonomous operation of the instrument
during the data reduction process. We look at the magnitude and nature of
errors introduced in the different pipeline steps of the processing. We use an
MHD sunspot simulation to isolate the data processing from other sources of
inaccuracy. We process the data set with calibration data obtained from SO/PHI
in orbit, and compare results calculated on a representative SO/PHI model on
ground with a reference implementation of the same pipeline, without the
on-board processing trade-offs. Our investigation shows that the accuracy in
the Stokes vectors, achieved by the data processing, is at least two orders of
magnitude better than what the instrument was designed to achieve. We also
found that the errors in the physical parameters are within the accuracy of
typical RTE inversions with Milne-Eddington approximation of the atmosphere.
This paper demonstrates that the on-board data reduction of the data from
SO/PHI does not compromise the accuracy of the processing. This places on-board
data processing as a viable alternative for future scientific instruments that
would need more telemetry than many missions are able to provide, in particular
those in deep space.

topic with contradictory research findings. A comprehensive understanding of
the response of urban and rural areas to HWs, considering the underlying cause
of surface energy budget changes, remains elusive. This study attempts to
address this gap by investigating a 2020 HW event in the Greater Sydney Area
using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Findings
indicate that the HW intensifies the nighttime surface UHI by approximately
4{\deg}C. An analysis of surface energy budgets reveals that urban areas store
more heat during the HW due to receiving more solar radiation and less
evapotranspiration compared to rural areas. The maximum heat storage flux in
urban during the HW can be around 200 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. The
stored heat is released at nightime, raising the air temperature in the urban
areas. Forests and savannas have relatively lower storage heat fluxes due to
high transpiration and albedo, and the maximum heat storage flux is only around
50 W/m2 higher than that during post-HW. In contrast, a negative synergistic
effect is detected between the 2-m UHI and HW. This may be because other
meteorological conditions including wind have substantial impacts on the air
temperature pattern. The strong hot and dry winds coming from the west and the
proximity of tall buildings to the coast diminish the sea breeze coming from
the east, resulting in a higher air temperature in the western urban district.
Meanwhile, the western forest area also experiences higher temperatures due to
the westward winds. In addition, changes in wind direction alter the
temperature distribution in the northern rural region. Based on the present
study, urban climate simulation data and associated findings can be used to
develop urban heat mitigation strategies for UHI during HW.

which is driven through merger events and interactions. Thus, the analysis of
these systems can be valuable in understanding galaxy evolution and studying
structure formation. In this work, we present a new publicly available
catalogue of close galaxy pairs identified using photometric redshifts provided
by the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). To efficiently
detect them we take advantage of the high-precision photo$-z$ ($\sigma_{68} <
0.02$) and apply an identification algorithm previously tested using simulated
data. This algorithm considers the projected distance between the galaxies
($r_p < 50$ kpc), the projected velocity difference ($\Delta V < 3500$ km/s)
and an isolation criterion to obtain the pair sample. We applied this technique
to the total sample of galaxies provided by PAUS and to a subset with
high-quality redshift estimates. Finally, the most relevant result we achieved
was determining the mean mass for several subsets of galaxy pairs selected
according to their total luminosity, colour and redshift, using galaxy-galaxy
lensing estimates. For pairs selected from the total sample of PAUS with a mean
$r-$band luminosity $10^{10.6} h^{-2} L_\odot$, we obtain a mean mass of
$M_{200} = 10^{12.2} h^{-1} M_\odot$, compatible with the mass-luminosity ratio
derived for elliptical galaxies. We also study the mass-to-light ratio $M/L$ as
a function of the luminosity $L$ and find a lower $M/L$ (or steeper slope with
$L$) for pairs than the one extrapolated from the measurements in groups and
galaxy clusters.

designed for heterogeneous networks with massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output

Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem, where we optimize the HFL
device association and manage the wireless transmitted energy. However due to
its high complexity, we design a Heuristic Resource Management Algorithm,
namely H2RMA, that respects energy, channel quality, and accuracy constraints,
while presenting a low computational complexity. We also improve the energy
consumption of the network using an efficient device scheduling scheme.
Finally, we investigate device mobility and its impact on the HFL performance.
Our extensive experiments confirm the high performance of the proposed resource

improving the effectiveness of traditional campus friendship network and the

behavior regularity. This paper enriches the theoretical research of complex
friendship network considering the characteristics of time, and also provides

origami delta manipulator driven by three servomotors, enabling active motion
compensation at the end-effector. Its composite multimaterial links help reduce
the weight, while their flexibility allow for compliant aerial interaction with

bootstrap their language skills. The modelling encompasses properties of the
input data used for training the models, the cognitive hypotheses and their
algorithmic implementations being tested, and the evaluation methodologies to
compare models to human data. Recent developments have enabled the use of more
naturalistic training data for computational models. This also motivates
development of more naturalistic tests of model behaviour. A crucial step
towards such an aim is to develop representative speech datasets consisting of
speech heard by infants in their natural environments. However, a major
drawback of such recordings is that they are typically noisy, and it is
currently unclear how the sound quality could affect analyses and modelling
experiments conducted on such data. In this paper, we explore this aspect for
the case of infant-directed speech (IDS) and adult-directed speech (ADS)
analysis. First, we manually and automatically annotated audio quality of
utterances extracted from two corpora of child-centred long-form recordings (in
English and French). We then compared acoustic features of IDS and ADS in an
in-lab dataset and across different audio quality subsets of naturalistic data.
Finally, we assessed how the audio quality and recording environment may change
the conclusions of a modelling analysis using a recent self-supervised learning
model. Our results show that the use of modest and high audio quality
naturalistic speech data result in largely similar conclusions on IDS and ADS
in terms of acoustic analyses and modelling experiments. We also found that an
automatic sound quality assessment tool can be used to screen out useful parts
of long-form recordings for a closer analysis with comparable results to that
of manual quality annotation.

processed at the cloud, and the control signals are sent back to the relevant
actuators, as part of the IoT applications. This cloud-centric IoT model,
resulted in increased latencies and network load, and compromised privacy. To
address these problems, Fog Computing was coined by Cisco in 2012, a decade
ago, which utilizes proximal computational resources for processing the sensor
data. Ever since its proposal, fog computing has attracted significant
attention and the research fraternity focused at addressing different
challenges such as fog frameworks, simulators, resource management, placement
strategies, quality of service aspects, fog economics etc. However, after a
decade of research, we still do not see large-scale deployments of
public/private fog networks, which can be utilized in realizing interesting IoT
applications. In the literature, we only see pilot case studies and small-scale
testbeds, and utilization of simulators for demonstrating scale of the
specified models addressing the respective technical challenges. There are
several reasons for this, and most importantly, fog computing did not present a
clear business case for the companies and participating individuals yet. This
paper summarizes challenges, state-of-the-art and future research directions in
realizing real-time fog computing applications. Contrary to other survey

this work discusses the fog research challenges and solutions in much broader

collisions is that the dynamical models based on viscous hydrodynamics fail to
describe the experimental elliptic flow $v_2$ and the triangular flow $v_3$
simultaneously in ultra-central collisions. The problem, known as the
""ultra-central flow puzzle"", is specifically that hydrodynamics-based models
predict the flow ratio of the two-particle cumulant method $v_2\{2\}/v_3\{2\} >
1$ while $v_2\{2\}/v_3\{2\} \sim 1$ in the experimental data. In this Letter,
we focus on the effects of hydrodynamic fluctuations during the space-time
evolution of the QGP fluid on the flow observables in the ultra-central
collisions. Using the (3+1)-dimensional integrated dynamical model which
includes relativistic fluctuating hydrodynamics, we analyze the anisotropic
flow coefficients $v_n\{2\}$ in 0-0.2% central Pb+Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}=2.76~\text{TeV}$. We find that the hydrodynamic
fluctuations decrease the model overestimate of $v_2\{2\}/v_3\{2\}$ from the
experimental data by about 19% within the present setup of $\eta/s = 1/2\pi$.
This means that the hydrodynamic fluctuations qualitatively have an effect to
improve the situation for the puzzle, but the effect of the hydrodynamic
fluctuations alone is quantitatively insufficient to resolve the puzzle. The
decrease of the ratio largely depends on the shear viscosity $\eta/s$, which
calls for future comprehensive analyses with, for example, a realistic
temperature-dependent viscosity.

  distribution models can improve predictive performance",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  1. Species distribution models and maps from large-scale biodiversity data
are necessary for conservation management. One current issue is that
biodiversity data are prone to taxonomic misclassifications. Methods to account
for these misclassifications in multispecies distribution models have assumed
that the classification probabilities are constant throughout the study. In
reality, classification probabilities are likely to vary with several
covariates. Failure to account for such heterogeneity can lead to bias in
parameter estimates. 2. Here we present a general multispecies distribution
model that accounts for heterogeneity in the classification process. The
proposed model assumes a multinomial generalised linear model for the
classification confusion matrix. We compare the performance of the
heterogeneous classification model to that of the homogeneous classification
model by assessing how well they estimate the parameters in the model and their
predictive performance on hold-out samples. We applied the model to gull data
from Norway, Denmark and Finland, obtained from GBIF. 3. Our simulation study
showed that accounting for heterogeneity in the classification process
increased precision by 30% and reduced accuracy and recall by 6%. Applying the
model framework to the gull dataset did not improve the predictive performance
between the homogeneous and heterogeneous models due to the smaller
misclassified sample sizes. However, when machine learning predictive scores
are used as weights to inform the species distribution models about the
classification process, the precision increases by 70%. 4. We recommend
multiple multinomial regression to be used to model the variation in the
classification process when the data contains relatively larger misclassified
samples. Machine prediction scores should be used when the data contains
relatively smaller misclassified samples.

tessellation evolves with repeated 'wetting followed by drying' cycles. The
natural system here is a crack network in a drying colloidal material, for
example, a layer of mud. A spring network model is used to simulate consecutive
wetting and drying cycles in mud layers until the crack mosaic matures. The
simulated results compare favourably with reported experimental findings. The
evolution of these crack mosaics has been mapped as a trajectory of a 4-vector
tuple in a geometry-topology domain. A phenomenological relation between energy
and crack geometry as functions of time cycles is proposed based on principles
of crack mechanics. We follow the crack pattern evolution to find that the
pattern veers towards a Voronoi mosaic in order to minimize the system energy.
Some examples of static crack mosaics in nature have also been explored to
verify if nature prefers Voronoi patterns. In this context, the authors define
new geometric measures of Voronoi-ness of crack mosaics to quantify how close a
tessellation is to a Voronoi tessellation, or even, to a Centroidal Voronoi
tessellation.

modern physics. One of the most promising search strategy to detect DM at
laboratories is through the indirect search of cosmic particles that are
produced from DM annihilation in space. In particular, the flux of cosmic
positrons has been measured with high precision by the AMS-02 experiment
demonstrating that an excess above 10 GeV, with respect to the secondary
production, is present. We study in this paper the possible DM origin of the
positron excess finding the values of the DM mass $M$ and annihilation cross
section $\langle \sigma v \rangle$ that are needed to fit high-energy positron
data. In particular, we find that for DM annihilating into $b\bar{b}$ it is
required to have $M=43$ TeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 10^{-21}$ cm$^3$/s
while for $\tau^+\tau^-$ $M=2$ TeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle = 3\times
10^{-23}$ cm$^3$/s. If DM produce positrons, they are expected to generate
gamma rays from the center of the Milky Way and around dwarf galaxy satellites
of the Galaxy. We thus combine the values for the DM mass and annihilation
cross section obtained with the fit to AMS-02 positron data with the upper
limits derived with the non-detection of $\gamma$ rays with HESS in the
direction of the Galactic center and Fermi-LAT for the combined analysis of
dwarf galaxies. The main result of the paper is that only DM annihilating into
$\mu^+ \mu^-$ with a mass around 500 GeV and $\langle \sigma v \rangle =
4\times 10^{-24}$ cm$^3$/s can fit AMS-02 data and be compatible with the upper
limits found with $\gamma$ rays. As for the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ ($b\bar{b}$)
channel, DM can contribute at most at a few tens $\%$ (a few \%) level.

whether there is an $(s,t)$-path in $G$ whose vertex set contains a subset of

lemma for polynomial identity testing and thus are randomized, and therefore
the existence of a deterministic FPT algorithm for this problem remains open.
We present the first deterministic FPT algorithm that solves the problem in

our algorithm works on more general classes of matroids. In particular, this is
the first FPT algorithm for the case when matroid $M$ is represented over
rationals. Our main technical contribution is the nontrivial adaptation of the
classic irrelevant vertex technique to frameworks to reduce the given instance

needs. While onshore wind expansion faces public acceptance problems, for
offshore wind the European Commission has introduced ambitious goals to
increase capacity from 15GW to 300GW in 2050. Incorporating more offshore wind
electricity into the power grid may offer a more widely accepted way to satisfy
Europe's energy demand. In particular, the North Sea region has large potential
for offshore wind generation. However, to fully exploit the wind potential in
the North Sea, the grid integration of offshore wind and floating wind turbines
are vital, especially when onshore wind capacity and onshore grid expansion are
constrained. For the grid integration, a meshed offshore grid can offer a
viable alternative to the standard direct connection of offshore wind parks to
the nearest point on land combined with point-to-point HVDC connections. In
this paper, we investigate the benefits of having a meshed offshore grid in the
North Sea and considering floating wind besides fixed-bottom wind
installations. In our analysis, we look at eight different scenarios, where
onshore wind potentials and onshore line expansion are limited, to explore the
effects of low public acceptance. Our results demonstrate that the presence of
an offshore grid can reduce total system costs by up to 2.6 bn Euro/a. In the
scenarios with an offshore meshed grid, ~8% more offshore wind capacities are
built compared to the scenarios without a meshed grid. Furthermore, the
analysis shows that if onshore wind potentials are restricted, floating wind
turbines play a key role and compensate for lacking onshore wind capacities.

(DM) annihilation or decay are one of the most investigated signals in indirect

matter. However, such ``dark'' systems have a poorly known level of magnetic
turbulence, which determines the residence time of the electrons and positrons
and therefore also the strength of the expected signal. This typically leads to
significant uncertainties in the derived DM bounds. In a novel approach, we
compute the self-confinement of the DM-induced electrons and positrons. Indeed,
they themselves generate irregularities in the magnetic field, thus setting a
lower limit on the presence of the magnetic turbulence. We specifically apply
this approach to dwarf spheroidal galaxies. Finally, by comparing the expected
synchrotron emission with radio data from the direction of the Draco galaxy
collected at the Giant Metre Radio Telescope, we show that the proposed

ensure fairness and accountability has led to a large number of model proposals
in the literature, largely formulated as optimisation problems with constraints
reducing or eliminating the effect of sensitive attributes on the response.
While this approach is very flexible from a theoretical perspective, the
resulting models are somewhat black-box in nature: very little can be said
about their statistical properties, what are the best practices in their
applied use, and how they can be extended to problems other than those they
were originally designed for. Furthermore, the estimation of each model
requires a bespoke implementation involving an appropriate solver which is less
than desirable from a software engineering perspective.
  In this paper, we describe the fairml R package which implements our previous
work (Scutari, Panero, and Proissl 2022) and related models in the literature.
fairml is designed around classical statistical models (generalised linear
models) and penalised regression results (ridge regression) to produce fair
models that are interpretable and whose properties are well-known. The
constraint used to enforce fairness is orthogonal to model estimation, making
it possible to mix-and-match the desired model family and fairness definition
for each application. Furthermore, fairml provides facilities for model
estimation, model selection and validation including diagnostic plots.

parameterized algorithms. The idea is that many computational problems admit
``natural'' guarantees bringing to algorithmic questions whether a better
solution (above the guarantee) could be obtained efficiently. The above
guarantee paradigm has led to several exciting discoveries in the areas of
parameterized algorithms and kernelization. We argue that this paradigm could
bring forth fresh perspectives on well-studied problems in approximation
algorithms. Our example is the longest cycle problem. One of the oldest results
in extremal combinatorics is the celebrated Dirac's theorem from 1952. Dirac's
theorem provides the following guarantee on the length of the longest cycle:
for every 2-connected n-vertex graph G with minimum degree \delta(G)\leq n/2,
the length of a longest cycle L is at least 2\delta(G). Thus, the ``essential''
part in finding the longest cycle is in approximating the ``offset'' k = L - 2
\delta(G). The main result of this paper is the above-guarantee approximation
theorem for k. Informally, the theorem says that approximating the offset k is
not harder than approximating the total length L of a cycle. In other words,
for any (reasonably well-behaved) function f, a polynomial time algorithm
constructing a cycle of length f(L) in an undirected graph with a cycle of
length L, yields a polynomial time algorithm constructing a cycle of length
2\delta(G)+\Omega(f(k)).

security and industrial applications requiring high-resolution imaging of

essential to the performance of such applications and depends directly on
system bandwidth. However, because high-bandwidth systems face several
prohibitive hurdles, an alternative solution is to operate multiple radars at
distinct frequency bands and fuse the multiband signals. Current multiband
signal fusion methods assume a simple target model and a small number of point
reflectors, which is invalid for realistic security screening and industrial
imaging scenarios wherein the target model effectively consists of a large
number of reflectors. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the
first use of deep learning for multiband signal fusion. The proposed network,
called kR-Net, employs a hybrid, dual-domain complex-valued convolutional
neural network (CV-CNN) to fuse multiband signals and impute the missing
samples in the frequency gaps between subbands. By exploiting the relationships
in both the wavenumber domain and wavenumber spectral domain, the proposed
framework overcomes the drawbacks of existing multiband imaging techniques for
realistic scenarios at a fraction of the computation time of existing multiband
fusion algorithms. Our method achieves high-resolution imaging of intricate
targets previously impossible using conventional techniques and enables finer
resolution capacity for concealed weapon detection and occluded object
classification using multiband signaling without requiring more advanced
hardware. Furthermore, a fully integrated multiband imaging system is developed
using commercially available millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars for efficient

deep learning methods side-step the problem sub-optimally by using a proxy loss
for training, which was originally designed for another task and is not
tailored to the specifics of the objective. The proxy loss functions may or may
not align well with the original non-differentiable objective. An appropriate
proxy has to be designed for a novel task, which may not be feasible for a
non-specialist. This thesis makes four main contributions toward bridging the

it has been shown that when the SSH chain is coupled to an external laser field

studying an extended version of the SSH chain with extended-range hoppings,

quantum mechanics, we address what happens to each of these two velocity
components when the Orthodox kinetic energy thermalizes in closed systems, and
how the pertinent weak values yield experimental information about them. We
show that, after thermalization, the expectation values of both the (squared)
current and osmotic velocities approach the same stationary value, that is,
each of the Bohmian kinetic and quantum potential energies approaches half of
the Orthodox kinetic energy. Such a `kinetic energy equipartition' is a novel
signature of quantum thermalization that can empirically be tested in the

expectation values of (squared) real and imaginary parts of the

presented here is independent on any ontological status given to these hidden

challenges of cost-effectiveness and scalability inherent to near-field
imaging. In this paper, near-field MIMO-ISAR mmWave imaging systems are
discussed and developed. The rotational ISAR (R-ISAR) regime investigated in
this paper requires rotating the target at a constant radial distance from the
transceiver and scanning the transceiver along a vertical track. Using a 77GHz
mmWave radar, a high resolution three-dimensional (3-D) image can be
reconstructed from this two-dimensional scanning taking into account the
spherical near-field wavefront. While prior work in literature consists of
single-input-single-output circular synthetic aperture radar (SISO-CSAR)
algorithms or computationally sluggish MIMO-CSAR image reconstruction
algorithms, this paper proposes a novel algorithm for efficient MIMO 3-D
holographic imaging and details the design of a MIMO R-ISAR imaging system. The
proposed algorithm applies a multistatic-to-monostatic phase compensation to
the R-ISAR regime allowing for use of highly efficient monostatic algorithms.
We demonstrate the algorithm's performance in real-world imaging scenarios on a
prototyped MIMO R-ISAR platform. Our fully integrated system, consisting of a
mechanical scanner and efficient imaging algorithm, is capable of pairing the
scanning efficiency of the MIMO regime with the computational efficiency of
single pixel image reconstruction algorithms.

prediction task in the emerging area of computational pathology. There has been
a surge of research in deep learning models for WSI classification with
clinical applications such as cancer detection or prediction of molecular
mutations from WSIs. Most methods require expensive and labor-intensive manual
annotations by expert pathologists. Weakly supervised Multiple Instance
Learning (MIL) methods have recently demonstrated excellent performance;
however, they still require large slide-level labeled training datasets that
need a careful inspection of each slide by an expert pathologist. In this work,
we propose a fully unsupervised WSI classification algorithm based on mutual
transformer learning. Instances from gigapixel WSI (i.e., image patches) are
transformed into a latent space and then inverse-transformed to the original
space. Using the transformation loss, pseudo-labels are generated and cleaned
using a transformer label-cleaner. The proposed transformer-based pseudo-label
generation and cleaning modules mutually train each other iteratively in an
unsupervised manner. A discriminative learning mechanism is introduced to
improve normal versus cancerous instance labeling. In addition to unsupervised
classification, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for
weak supervision for cancer subtype classification as downstream analysis.
Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show excellent
performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. We intend to make the

likely, but also consider whether what they want to say fits the position. In
this paper, we present a model (an extension of TurnGPT) that conditions the
end-of-turn prediction on both conversation history and what the next speaker
wants to say. We found that our model consistently outperforms the baseline

scenarios where turn predictions can be ambiguous solely from the conversation
history: 1) when the current utterance contains a statement followed by a

attacks, and numerous such incidents have been reported in the last decade all
over the world. The notion of participatory sensing, or crowdsensing, is that a
large ensemble of voluntary contributors provides measurements, rather than
relying on a dedicated sensing infrastructure. The participatory sensing
network under consideration in this work is based on GNSS receivers embedded
in, for example, mobile phones. The provided measurements refer to the
receiver-reported carrier-to-noise-density ratio ($C/N_0$) estimates or
automatic gain control (AGC) values. In this work, we exploit $C/N_0$
measurements to locate a GNSS jammer, using multiple receivers in a
crowdsourcing manner. We extend a previous jammer position estimator by only
including data that is received during parts of the sensing period where
jamming is detected by the sensor. In addition, we perform hardware testing for
verification and evaluation of the proposed and compared state-of-the-art
algorithms. Evaluations are performed using a Samsung S20+ mobile phone as
participatory sensor and a Spirent GSS9000 GNSS simulator to generate GNSS and
jamming signals. The proposed algorithm is shown to work well when using
$C/N_0$ measurements and outperform the alternative algorithms in the evaluated
scenarios, producing a median error of 50 meters when the pathloss exponent is
2. With higher pathloss exponents the error gets higher. The AGC output from
the phone was too noisy and needs further processing to be useful for position

towards improving classification accuracy of non-moving (static) hand gestures
using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and
frequency-modulated-continuous-wave (FMCW) millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars.
Recently, non-contact hand pose and static gesture recognition have received
considerable attention in many applications ranging from human-computer
interaction (HCI), augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR), and even therapeutic
range of motion for medical applications. While most current solutions rely on
optical or depth cameras, these methods require ideal lighting and temperature
conditions. mmWave radar devices have recently emerged as a promising
alternative offering low-cost system-on-chip sensors whose output signals
contain precise spatial information even in non-ideal imaging conditions.
Additionally, deep convolutional neural networks have been employed extensively
in image recognition by learning both feature extraction and classification
simultaneously. However, little work has been done towards static gesture
recognition using mmWave radars and CNNs due to the difficulty involved in
extracting meaningful features from the radar return signal, and the results
are inferior compared with dynamic gesture classification. This article
presents an efficient data collection approach and a novel technique for deep
CNN training by introducing ``sterile'' images which aid in distinguishing
distinct features among the static gestures and subsequently improve the
classification accuracy. Applying the proposed data collection and training
methods yields an increase in classification rate of static hand gestures from
$85\%$ to $93\%$ and $90\%$ to $95\%$ for range and range-angle profiles,
respectively.

Majorana zero modes in the topological phase is a quantization of the zero-bias
conductance at $G(V=0)=2e^2/h$. However, the finite size of the wires and the
presence of the quantum dot in the junction generate more complicated features
which lead to deviations from this simple picture. Here, we analyze the
behavior of the conductance at zero and finite bias, $G(V)$, as a function of a
gate voltage applied at the quantum dot in the case of a finite-length wire. We
analyze the effect of the angle between the magnetic field and the orientation
associated to the spin-orbit coupling. We provide a detailed description of the
spectral features of the quantum wire weakly and also strongly coupled to the
quantum dot and describe the conditions to have zero-energy states in these two
regimes for both the topological and non-topological phases. We also analyze
the concomitant behavior of the noise. We identify qualitative features that
are useful to distinguish between the topological and non-topological phases.
We show that in a strongly coupled quantum dot the simultaneous hybridization
with the topological modes and the supragap states of the wire mask the
signatures of the Majorana bound states in both the conductance and the Fano

maximum likelihood parameter estimation of elliptically contoured

over which the Riemannian gradients can be calculated efficiently. The proposed

parameter (SOP) is not trivial as it varies with the number of species we use
to describe the system, M . Depending on the degree of polydispersity, there is
an optimum value of M = M0 where we show that the mutual information of the
system increases. However, surprisingly the correlation between a recently
proposed SOP and the dynamics is highest for M = 1. This effect increases with
polydispersity. We find that the SOP at M = 1 is coupled with the particle
size, {\sigma}, and this coupling increases with polydispersity and decreases
with an increase in M . Careful analysis shows that at lower polydispersity the
SOP is a good predictor of the dynamics. However, at higher polydispersity, the
dynamics is strongly dependent on {\sigma}. Since the coupling between the SOP
and {\sigma} is higher for M = 1 thus, it appears to be a better predictor of
the dynamics. We also study the Vibrality an order parameter independent of
structural information. Compared to SOP, at high polydispersity we find
Vibrality to be a marginally better predictor of the dynamics. However, this
high predictive power of Vibrality, which is not there at lower polydispersity,
appears to be due to its stronger coupling with {\sigma}. Thus our study
suggests that for systems with high polydispersity, the correlation of any
order parameter and {\sigma} will affect the correlation between the order
parameter and dynamics and need not project a generic predictive power of the
order parameter.

  matter search","60 pages 24 figures, 176 references",,,,"hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the paper expressions are obtained for the event rates expected in
experiments aimed at direct detection of dark matter (DM) particles. These
expressions allow one to estimate the rates taking into account simultaneously
elastic (coherent) and inelastic (incoherent) channels of DM particle
interaction with nuclei. The nonzero nuclear excitation energies are used in
the calculation of the inelastic scattering contributions. A strong correlation
between the excitation energy and the recoil energy of the excited nucleus
limits the possibility of the inelastic channel detection with a number of
nuclei. Together with the standard model of the DM distribution in the Galaxy
some models are considered, which allow higher speeds of the DM particle. As
the nuclear recoil energy, TA, increases, the dominance of the elastic
interaction channel is smoothly replaced by the dominance of the inelastic one.
Therefore, if a detector is set up to detect only elastic scattering events, it
starts to lose capability of seeing anything. The only way to notice the
interaction remains the gamma radiation from the deexcitation of the nucleus.
In the case of spin-independent DM interaction, as TA increases, the inelastic
contribution quickly dominates. If the DM particle interacts only
spin-dependently, the detectors focused on registration of the elastic
spin-dependent DM signal will see nothing, since the signal goes through the
inelastic channel. It looks like the desired DM interaction could have a
noticeable intensity, but the DM detector is unable to detect it. Therefore, a
setup aimed at the direct DM detection should register two signals. The first
is the nuclear recoil energy and the second is the gamma-quanta with a certain
energy from the target nucleus deexitation. The experiment will provide the
complete information about the DM interaction.

find its origins to be packets suboptimally mapped to either link before
carrying out the backoff, with the latter likely to be interrupted on the

  We develop a generalization of Courcelle's theorem that yields efficient

comparisons via the quantifier-alternation depth of the involved variables,

$1/\varepsilon$, allowing us to fully interpolate between faster approximate

limitations of individual sensors, allowing connected agents to perceive
environments beyond their line-of-sight and field of view. However, the
reliability of collaborative perception heavily depends on the data aggregation
strategy and communication bandwidth, which must overcome the challenges posed

a comprehensive and highly granular social network level: 17.2 million
registered residents of the Netherlands that are connected through around 1.3
billion ties distributed over four distinct tie types. We take income
assortativity as a measure of socio-economic segregation, compare a social
network and spatial neighborhood approach, and find that the social network
structure exhibits two times as much segregation. As such, this work challenges
the dominance of the spatial perspective on segregation in both literature and
policymaking. While at a particular scale of spatial aggregation (e.g., the
geographical neighborhood), patterns of socio-economic segregation may appear
relatively minimal, they may in fact persist in the underlying social network
structure. Furthermore, we discover higher socio-economic segregation in larger
cities, shedding a different light on the common view of cities as hubs for
diverse socio-economic mixing. A population-scale social network perspective
hence offers a way to uncover hitherto 'hidden' segregation that extends beyond

that the EOS becomes softer with increasing DM momentum, and the DM has
marginal effects on nuclear matter properties, except for the EOSs and binding
energy per particle. The study also calculated the properties of isolated,
static, and rotating DM admixed NS and found that the DM has significant
effects on both static and rotating NS. We have also observed that a tiny
amount of DM can accumulate inside the NS, and more amount of it makes the NS
unstable. The study also suggests that the secondary component might be a NS
with DM content if the underlying nuclear EOS is sufficiently stiff. The
$f$-mode oscillations of the DM admixed hyperon stars are calculated and found
that there exist a correlation between canonical $f$-mode frequency and the

limited emission in the \textit{photosynthetically active} region of the
spectrum ($400 - 700$ nm), suggesting that they may not be able to support
oxygenic photosynthesis. However, photoautotrophs on Earth frequently exploit
very dim environments with the aid of highly structured and extremely efficient
antenna systems. Moreover, the anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, which do not
need to oxidize water to source electrons, can exploit far red and near
infrared light. Here we apply a simple model of a photosynthetic antenna to a
range of model stellar spectra, ranging from ultra-cool (2300 K) to Sun-like
(5800 K). We assume that a photosynthetic organism will evolve an antenna that
maximizes the rate of energy input while also minimizing fluctuations. The
latter is the 'noise cancelling' principle recently reported by Arp et al.
2020. Applied to the Solar spectrum this predicts optimal antenna
configurations in agreement with the chlorophyll Soret absorption bands.
Applied to cooler stars, the optimal antenna peaks become redder with
decreasing stellar temperature, crossing to the typical wavelength ranges
associated with anoxygenic photoautotrophs at $\sim 3300$ K. Lastly, we compare
the relative input power delivered by antennae of equivalent size around
different stars and find that the predicted variation is within the same order

galaxies extends to the bulges of types S0 to Sb, whereas fainter and smaller
bulges of later Hubble types depart from it, with decreasing bulge-to-total
ratio (B/T) and S\'ersic indices. There is a continuous transition from
pseudo-bulges to classical ones, proposed to occur for g magnitudes between
-17.8 to -19.1. The size-luminosity relations for E and dE types are steeper
and similar to those from Binggeli et al. (1984), resp., below which EFIGI
lenticular and spiral bulges display a curved relation. The disks and
irregulars also follow a continuous curved size-luminosity relation such that
while they grow, they first brighten and then stabilize in surface brightness.
Moreover, we obtain the unprecedented result that the effective radii of both
the bulges and disks of spirals increase as power-laws of B/T, with a steeper
increase for the bulges. The increase with B/T is much steeper and similar for
the bulges and disks of lenticulars. The ratio of disk-to-bulge effective radii
varies accordingly across 2 orders of magnitude in B/T for all lenticular and
spiral types, with a mean disk-to-bulge ratio decreasing from ~15 for Sbc to
Scd types to ~6 for S0. We tabulate all derived scaling relations, so that they
can be used to build realistic mock images of nearby galaxies. The new curved
size-luminosity relations will prevent over or under estimates of bulge, disk
and galaxy sizes at all magnitudes. These results complement the analysis of
Quilley & de Lapparent (2022) by providing the joint size and luminosity
variations of bulges and disks, as they evolve reversely along the Hubble
sequence.

fifth-generation (5G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) devices are becoming
increasingly affordable and available, high-resolution SAR imaging is feasible
for end-user applications and non-laboratory environments. Emerging
applications such freehand imaging, wherein a handheld radar is scanned
throughout space by a user, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imaging, and
automotive SAR face several unique challenges for high-resolution imaging.
First, recovering a SAR image requires knowledge of the array positions
throughout the scan. While recent work has introduced camera-based positioning
systems capable of adequately estimating the position, recovering the algorithm
efficiently is a requirement to enable edge and Internet of Things (IoT)
technologies. Efficient algorithms for non-cooperative near-field SAR sampling
have been explored in recent work, but suffer image defocusing under position
estimation error and can only produce medium-fidelity images. In this paper, we
introduce a mobile-friend vision transformer (ViT) architecture to address
position estimation error and perform SAR image super-resolution (SR) under
irregular sampling geometries. The proposed algorithm, Mobile-SRViT, is the
first to employ a ViT approach for SAR image enhancement and is validated in

system for the generation of HD maps from vehicle fleet data, which is tolerant

reference lines. Using randomly selected drives as pivot drives, a step-wise
lateral sampling of detections is performed. These sampled points are then
clustered and aligned using Expectation Maximization (EM), estimating a lateral
offset for each drive to compensate localization errors. The clustered points
are replaced with the maxima of their probability density function (PDF) and
connected to form polylines using a modified rectangular linear assignment
algorithm. The data from vehicles on varying routes is then fused into a
hierarchical singular map graph. The proposed approach achieves an average
accuracy below 0.5 meters compared to a hand annotated ground truth map, as
well as correctly resolving lane splits and merges, proving the feasibility of
the use of vehicle fleet data for the generation of highway HD maps.

order to model two opposite configurations representing a solar activity
maximum and minimum respectively. Both were derived from magnetograms which
were obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar

which differ only by their initial magnetic flux. We especially investigate the
geometry of the flux rope during the early stages of the propagation as well as
the influence of its initial parameters and solar wind configuration on 1D
profiles derived at 0.1~AU. At the beginning of the propagation, the shape of
the flux ropes varies between simulations during low and high solar activity.
We find dynamics that are consistent with the standard CME model, such as the
pinching of the legs and the appearance of post-flare loops. Despite the
differences in geometry, the synthetic density and magnetic field time profiles
at 0.1~AU are very similar in both solar wind configurations. These profiles
are similar to those observed further in the heliosphere and suggest the
presence of a magnetic ejecta composed of the initially implemented flux rope

emerging modes of near-field synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. Recent
research extends convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures from the
optical to the electromagnetic domain to achieve super resolution on images
generated from radar signaling. Specifically, near-field synthetic aperture
radar (SAR) imaging, a method for generating high-resolution images by scanning
a radar across space to create a synthetic aperture, is of interest due to its
high-fidelity spatial sensing capability, low cost devices, and large
application space. Since SAR imaging requires large aperture sizes to achieve
high resolution, super-resolution algorithms are valuable for many
applications. Freehand smartphone SAR, an emerging sensing modality, requires
irregular SAR apertures in the near-field and computation on mobile devices.
Achieving efficient high-resolution SAR images from irregularly sampled data
collected by freehand motion of a smartphone is a challenging task. In this
paper, we propose a novel CNN architecture to achieve SAR image
super-resolution for mobile applications by employing state-of-the-art SAR
processing and deep learning techniques. The proposed algorithm is verified via
simulation and an empirical study. Our algorithm demonstrates high-efficiency
and high-resolution radar imaging for near-field scenarios with irregular
scanning geometries.

Existing works often assume that features are readily available for each
incoming data point. However, in many real world applications, both feature
values and the labels are unknown a priori and can only be obtained at a cost.
For example, in medical diagnosis, doctors have to choose which tests to
perform (i.e., making costly feature queries) on a patient in order to make a
diagnosis decision (i.e., predicting labels). We provide a fresh perspective to
tackle this practical challenge. Our framework consists of an active planning
oracle embedded in an online learning scheme for which we investigate several
information acquisition functions. Specifically, we employ a surrogate
information acquisition function based on adaptive submodularity to actively
query feature values with a minimal cost, while using a posterior sampling
scheme to maintain a low regret for online prediction. We demonstrate the
efficiency and effectiveness of our framework via extensive experiments on
various real-world datasets. Our framework also naturally adapts to the
challenging setting of online learning with concept drift and is shown to be
competitive with baseline models while being more flexible.

The answer is negative in four dimensions. We examine whether this negative

dilaton field. We determine the IWP metrics completely in terms of one complex

dilaton field, it is now possible to add a perfect fluid source. In this case
the field equations reduce to a complex cubic equation. Hence this procedure
provides interior solutions to each IWP metric; and it is possible to cover all
naked singularities inside a compact surface where there is matter

birds to identify species of concern while measuring the success of
conservation interventions is essential for ecologists. However, monitoring is
time consuming, costly and often difficult to manage over long durations and at
meaningfully large spatial scales. Technology such as camera traps, acoustic
monitors and drones provide methods for non-invasive monitoring. There are two
main problems with using camera traps for monitoring: a) cameras generate many
images, making it difficult to process and analyse the data in a timely manner;
and b) the high proportion of false positives hinders the processing and
analysis for reporting. In this paper, we outline an approach for overcoming
these issues by utilising deep learning for real-time classi-fication of bird
species and automated removal of false positives in camera trap data. Images
are classified in real-time using a Faster-RCNN architecture. Images are
transmitted over 3/4G cam-eras and processed using Graphical Processing Units

removing the requirement for manual observations. Our models achieved an

sequence on the color magnitude diagram in two branches: A and B. While the A
branch consists mostly of WDs with H-rich atmospheres, the B branch is not
completely understood. Although invoked to be populated mainly by He-rich WDs,
the B branch overlaps a $\sim 0.8M_\odot$ evolutionary track with a pure He
envelope, fact that would imply an unexpected peak in the WD mass distribution.
In cold He-rich WDs, it is expected that the outer convective zone penetrates
into deep C-rich layers, thus leading to a slight C contamination in their
surfaces at $\sim 10,000$K. Here we aim at studying the Gaia bifurcation as the
natural consequence of C dredge-up by convection in cold He-dominated WDs.
Relying on accurate atmosphere models, we provide a new set of evolutionary
models for He-rich WDs employing different prescriptions for the C enrichment.
On the basis of these models, we made a population synthesis study of the Gaia
100pc WD sample to constrain the models that best fit the bifurcation. Our
study shows that He-rich WD models with a slight C contamination below the
optical detection limit can accurately reproduce the Gaia bifurcation. We refer
to these stars as stealth DQ WDs because they do not exhibit detectable C
signatures in their optical spectra, but the presence of C in their atmosphere
produces a continuum absorption favouring the emission in bluer wavelengths,
thereby creating the B branch of the bifurcation. Also, we show that the mass
distribution for He-rich WDs obtained when a stealth C contamination is
considered is consistent with the mass distribution for H-rich WDs and with the
standard evolutionary channels for their formation. We conclude that stealth DQ
WDs can account for the lower branch in the Gaia bifurcation. The C signatures
of these stars could be detectable in Ultra-Violet spectra.

metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is dominated by optically bright and dark
excitons. These excitons can be fully localized within a single TMD layer, or
the electron- and the hole-component of the exciton can be charge-separated
over multiple TMD layers. Such intra- or interlayer excitons have been
characterized in detail using all-optical spectroscopies, and, more recently,
photoemission spectroscopy. In addition, there are so-called hybrid excitons
whose electron- and/or hole-component are delocalized over two or more TMD
layers, and therefore provide a promising pathway to mediate charge-transfer
processes across the TMD interface. Hence, an in-situ characterization of their
energy landscape and dynamics is of vital interest. In this work, using
femtosecond momentum microscopy combined with many-particle modeling, we
quantitatively compare the dynamics of momentum-indirect intralayer excitons in
monolayer WSe$_2$ with the dynamics of momentum-indirect hybrid excitons in
heterobilayer WSe$_2$/MoS$_2$, and draw three key conclusions: First, we find
that the energy of hybrid excitons is reduced when compared to excitons with
pure intralayer character. Second, we show that the momentum-indirect
intralayer and hybrid excitons are formed via exciton-phonon scattering from
optically excited bright excitons. And third, we demonstrate that the
efficiency for phonon absorption and emission processes in the mono- and the
heterobilayer is strongly dependent on the energy alignment of the intralayer
and hybrid excitons with respect to the optically excited bright exciton.
Overall, our work provides microscopic insights into exciton dynamics in TMD

instruments in the near-infrared (nIR) domain, such as SPIRou, have facilitated
the study of M-type stars to more effectively characterize planetary systems.
However, the nIR presents unique challenges in exoplanet detection due to
various sources of planet-independent signals which can result in systematic
errors in the RV data.
  Aims: In order to address the challenges posed by the detection of
exoplanetary systems around M-type stars using nIR observations, we introduce a
new data-driven approach for correcting systematic errors in RV data. The
effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through its application to the
star GJ 251.
  Methods: Our proposed method, referred to as $\texttt{Wapiti}$ (Weighted
principAl comPonent analysIs reconsTructIon), uses a dataset of per-line RV
time-series generated by the line-by-line (LBL) algorithm and employs a
weighted principal component analysis (wPCA) to reconstruct the original RV
time-series. A multi-step process is employed to determine the appropriate
number of components, with the ultimate goal of subtracting the wPCA
reconstruction of the per-line RV time-series from the original data in order
to correct systematic errors.
  Results: The application of $\texttt{Wapiti}$ to GJ 251 successfully
eliminates spurious signals from the RV time-series and enables the first
detection in the nIR of GJ 251b, a known temperate super-Earth with an orbital
period of 14.2 days. This demonstrates that, even when systematics in SPIRou
data are unidentified, it is still possible to effectively address them and
fully realize the instrument's capability for exoplanet detection.
Additionally, in contrast to the use of optical RVs, this detection did not
require to filter out stellar activity, highlighting a key advantage of nIR RV
measurements.

significantly enhanced for moderate rotation, i.e., for an intermediate range
of Rossby numbers $Ro$, compared to the non-rotating case. At Rayleigh numbers
$Ra\lesssim5\cdot10^8$, the largest heat transport enhancement (HTE) is
achieved when the thicknesses of kinetic and thermal boundary layer are equal.
However, experimental and numerical observations show that, at larger $Ra$
($\gtrsim5\cdot10^8$), the maximal HTE starts to deviate from the expected
optimal boundary layer ratio and its amplitude decreases drastically. We
present data from direct numerical simulations of rotating RBC in a periodic
domain in the range of $10^7\leq Ra\leq10^{10}$ and $0\leq Ro^{-1}\leq40$ for
Prandtl number $Pr=4.38$ and $6.4$ to identify the reason for the transition to
this large $Ra$ regime of HTE. Our analysis reveals that the transition occurs
once the bulk flow at the optimal boundary layer ratio changes to geostrophic
turbulence for large $Ra$. In that flow state, the vertically coherent
vortices, which support HTE by Ekman pumping at smaller $Ra$, dissolve into
vertically decorrelated structures in the bulk, such that the enhancing effect
of Ekman pumping and the influence of the boundary layer ratio become small.
Additionally, more heat leaks out of the Ekman vortices as the fraction of
thermal dissipation in the bulk increases. We find that the rotation induced
shearing at the plates helps to increase the thermal dissipation in the bulk,
and thus acts as a limiting factor for HTE at large $Ra$: beyond a certain
ratio of wall shear stress to vortex strength, the heat transport decreases
irrespectively of the boundary layer ratio. This $Pr$ dependent threshold,
which roughly corresponds to a bulk accounting for $\approx1/3$ of the total
thermal dissipation, sets the maximal HTE and the optimal rotation rate at
large $Ra$.

Yet, traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques commonly enforce

develop diverse behaviors, resulting in emergent complementarity that benefits
the system. Despite this feat, there is a surprising lack of tools that measure
behavioral diversity in systems of learning agents. Such techniques would pave
the way towards understanding the impact of diversity in collective resilience
and performance. In this paper, we introduce System Neural Diversity (SND): a
measure of behavioral heterogeneity for multi-agent systems where agents have
stochastic policies. %over a continuous state space. We discuss and prove its
theoretical properties, and compare it with alternate, state-of-the-art
behavioral diversity metrics used in cross-disciplinary domains. Through
simulations of a variety of multi-agent tasks, we show how our metric
constitutes an important diagnostic tool to analyze latent properties of
behavioral heterogeneity. By comparing SND with task reward in static tasks,
where the problem does not change during training, we show that it is key to
understanding the effectiveness of heterogeneous vs homogeneous agents. In
dynamic tasks, where the problem is affected by repeated disturbances during
training, we show that heterogeneous agents are first able to learn specialized
roles that allow them to cope with the disturbance, and then retain these roles
when the disturbance is removed. SND allows a direct measurement of this latent
resilience, while other proxies such as task performance (reward) fail to.

Frank number, which refines $k$-edge-connectivity. The Frank number is defined
as the minimum number of orientations of $G$ for which every edge of $G$ is
deletable in at least one of them. They showed that every $3$-edge-connected

$3$-edge-colourable graphs the parameter is at most $3$. Here we strengthen the
latter result by showing that such graphs have Frank number $2$, which also
confirms a conjecture by Bar\'at and Bl\'aszik. Furthermore, we prove two
sufficient conditions for cubic graphs to have Frank number $2$ and use them in

composition for stock & flow diagrams. We first describe a hierarchical means
of diagram composition, in which a single existing stock is replaced by a
diagram featuring compatible flow structure. Our composition method offers
extra flexibility by allowing a single flow in the stock being replaced to
split into several flows totalling to the same overall flow rate. Secondly, to
address the common need of docking a stock & flow diagram with another
""upstream"" diagram depicting antecedent factors, we contribute a composition
approach that allows a flow out of an upstream stock in one diagram to be
connected to a downstream stock in another diagram. Both of these approaches
are enabled by performing colimit decomposition of stock & flow diagrams into
single-stock corollas and unit flows.

most of the mass in solids is in particles with Stokes numbers St $\simeq 0.1$.
$\it{ii})$. For $\epsilon \gtrsim 0.02-0.05$, solids with small Stokes numbers,

transforms learned, non-progressive image compression approaches into
progressive ones. The design of ProgDTD is based on the observation that the
information stored within the bottleneck of a compression model commonly varies
in importance. To create a progressive compression model, ProgDTD modifies the
training steps to enforce the model to store the data in the bottleneck sorted
by priority. We achieve progressive compression by transmitting the data in
order of its sorted index. ProgDTD is designed for CNN-based learned image
compression models, does not need additional parameters, and has a customizable
range of progressiveness. For evaluation, we apply ProgDTDto the hyperprior
model, one of the most common structures in learned image compression. Our
experimental results show that ProgDTD performs comparably to its
non-progressive counterparts and other state-of-the-art progressive models in

higher level of accuracy when addressing non-monotonic reasoning tasks.
Continual learning is added to LTNs by adopting a curriculum of learning from

dewetting of the bound surface charge within the electric double layer by the

double layer structure close to the contact line, which is affected by the

Charge separation increases with increasing contact angle and decreases with
increasing dewetting velocity. Our findings reveal the universal mechanism of
charge separation at receding contact lines, relevant to many dynamic wetting

deliveries. Using the RADPOS 4D dosimetry system, point doses were measured
inside and outside the tumor. Dose profiles were acquired using films along the
motion path of the tumor (S-I). In addition to dose measurements, RADPOS was

accurately predict the sensitivity of delivered dose to the starting phase of

developments in achieving stable approximations of Helmholtz solutions by plane
wave superposition. The study shows that the numerical instability and
ill-conditioning inherent in plane wave-based Trefftz methods can be
effectively overcome with regularization techniques, provided there exist
accurate approximations in the form of expansions with bounded coefficients.
Whenever the target solution contains high Fourier modes, propagative plane
waves fail to yield stable approximations due to the exponential growth of the
expansion coefficients. Conversely, evanescent plane waves, whose modal content
covers high Fourier regimes, are able to provide both accurate and stable
results. The developed numerical approach, which involves constructing
evanescent plane wave approximation sets by sampling the parametric domain
according to a probability density function, results in substantial
improvements when compared to conventional propagative plane wave schemes. The
following work extends this research to the three-dimensional setting,
confirming the achieved results and introducing new ones. By generalizing the
3D Jacobi$-$Anger identity to complex-valued directions, we show that any
Helmholtz solution in a ball can be represented as a continuous superposition
of evanescent plane waves. This representation extends the classical Herglotz
one and provides a relevant stability result that cannot be achieved with the
use of propagative waves alone. The proposed numerical recipes have been
tailored for the 3D setting and extended with new sampling strategies involving
extremal systems of points. These methods are tested by numerical experiments,
showing the desired accuracy and bounded-coefficient stability, in line with
the two-dimensional case.

nouns/adjectives. Motivated by this, we design a Mixture-of-Expert (MOE)-based
decoder, where each expert is built on MHA, for discriminating the graph
embeddings to generate different kinds of words. Since both the encoder and
decoder are built based on the MHA, as a result, we construct a homogeneous
encoder-decoder unlike the previous heterogeneous ones which usually apply
Fully-Connected-based GNN and LSTM-based decoder. The homogeneous architecture
enables us to unify the training configuration of the whole model instead of
specifying different training strategies for diverse sub-networks as in the
heterogeneous pipeline, which releases the training difficulty. Extensive
experiments on the MS-COCO captioning benchmark validate the effectiveness of
our TSG. The code is in: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ACL23_TSG.

non-trivially change the equilibria by inducing a metagame of choosing which
strategies to commit to. In this model, we demonstrate a strategy that an

forcing the remaining agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining items
(albeit for free). The attack is thus detrimental to the auctioneer who loses
most of their revenue. For various types of auctions that are not too
congested, we show that the strategy works as long as the agents have
valuations that are somewhat concentrated. In this case, all agents will
voluntarily cooperate with the attacker to enter into the lottery, because
doing so gives them a chance of receiving a free item that would have otherwise
cost an amount commensurate with their valuation. The attack is robust to a
large constant fraction of the agents being either oblivious to the attack or
having exceptionally high valuations (thus reluctant to enter into the
lottery). For these agents, the attacker may coerce them into cooperating by
promising them a free item rather than entering in to the lottery. We show that
the conditions for the attack to work hold with high probability when (1) the
auction is not too congested, and (2) the valuations are sampled i.i.d. from
either a uniform distribution or a Pareto distribution. The attack works for
first-price auctions, second-price auctions and the transaction fee mechanism

using the Knizhnik, Polyakov and Zamolodchikov (KPZ) relations, with the

(i.e., a properly pruned sub-network together with original weight

(GNNs) for effectively accelerating GNN inference. UGS simultaneously prunes
the graph adjacency matrix and the model weights using the same masking
mechanism, but since the roles of the graph adjacency matrix and the weight

different performance characteristics. Specifically, we find that the
performance of a sparsified GNN degrades significantly when the graph sparsity
goes beyond a certain extent. Therefore, we propose two techniques to improve
GNN performance when the graph sparsity is high. First, UGS prunes the
adjacency matrix using a loss formulation which, however, does not properly
involve all elements of the adjacency matrix; in contrast, we add a new
auxiliary loss head to better guide the edge pruning by involving the entire
adjacency matrix. Second, by regarding unfavorable graph sparsification as
adversarial data perturbations, we formulate the pruning process as a min-max
optimization problem to gain the robustness of lottery tickets when the graph
sparsity is high. We further investigate the question: Can the ""retrainable""
winning ticket of a GNN be also effective for graph transferring learning? We
call it the transferable graph lottery ticket (GLT) hypothesis. Extensive
experiments were conducted which demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
sparsification method over UGS, and which empirically verified our transferable

streams depends not only on how many data have been received, but also on how
many data can be well exploited timely, with resource and rapidity concerns, in
addition to the ability of learning algorithm and complexity of the problem.
For this purpose, in this article we introduce the notion of machine learning
throughput, define Stream Efficient Learning and present a preliminary

utilizes intra-stream contrast pairs, but introduces inter-stream contrast
pairs as hard samples to formulate a better representation learning. Besides,
to further exploit the potential of positive pairs and increase the robustness

increase the variance of positive pairs. To validate the effectiveness of our

different search operators are applied for sampling new solutions in the

when to use which operator to find optimal solutions efficiently. However, it
is difficult to theoretically analyse this relationship, especially in the

we propose to empirically analyse the relationship between operators in terms
of the correlation between their local optima and develop a measure for

consistent pattern in the correlation between commonly used operators. Based on
this newly proposed local optima correlation metric, we propose a novel
approach for adaptively selecting among the operators during the search

and ask to select a subset of items that maximize the value for the user. The
values of subsets often display diminishing returns, and hence, submodular
functions have been used to model them. If the inputs defining the submodular
function are known, then existing algorithms can be used. In many applications,
however, inputs have been observed to have social biases that reduce the
utility of the output subset. Hence, interventions to improve the utility are
desired. Prior works focus on maximizing linear functions -- a special case of
submodular functions -- and show that fairness constraint-based interventions
can not only ensure proportional representation but also achieve near-optimal
utility in the presence of biases. We study the maximization of a family of
submodular functions that capture functions arising in the aforementioned
applications. Our first result is that, unlike linear functions,
constraint-based interventions cannot guarantee any constant fraction of the
optimal utility for this family of submodular functions. Our second result is
an algorithm for submodular maximization. The algorithm provably outputs
subsets that have near-optimal utility for this family under mild assumptions
and that proportionally represent items from each group. In empirical
evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world data, we observe that this
algorithm improves the utility of the output subset for this family of
submodular functions over baselines.

echocardiogram data of cardiac mechanics, where we show the advantageous

paradigm, meaning that the spline geometry parametrization is directly used for
the discretization of the physical fields. The IGA model is benchmarked with a

accurately captured by an IGA model with only 320 elements and 4,700 degrees of

Hence, clustering on real-world graph with various levels of homophily poses a
new challenge to the graph research community. To fill this gap, we propose a
novel graph clustering method, which contains three key components: graph
reconstruction, a mixed filter, and dual graph clustering network. To be
graph-agnostic, we empirically construct two graphs which are high homophily
and heterophily from each data. The mixed filter based on the new graphs
extracts both low-frequency and high-frequency information. To reduce the

Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark graphs demonstrate our promising
performance. In particular, our method dominates others on heterophilic graphs.

states when the pseudospin symmetry is broken by electron correlation. However,
experimental explorations of these opportunities are very limited so far, due
to a lack of devices with optimized layer numbers and configurations. Here we
present electron transport measurements of hBN-encapsulated pentalayer graphene

tight-binding calculation predicts a metallic ground state. By increasing the
displacement field, we observed a Chern insulator state with C = -5 and two
other states with C = -3 at a low magnetic field of ~1 Tesla. At high

quarter- and half-metals. Therefore, rhombohedral-stacked pentalayer graphene

on the van Mises stress, which corresponds to the rupture risk of the aorta.
This is modeled as a Gaussian Markov random field and we define our
approximation as a basis of vectors that solve a series of optimization
problems. Each of these problems describes the minimization of an expected
weighted quadratic loss. The weights, which encapsulate the importance of each

by incorporating domain knowledge. Along with a more general discussion of
mathematical properties we provide an effective numerical heuristic to compute
the basis under general conditions. We explicitly explore two such bases on the

Incidents in the recent past indicate that it is becoming necessary to transfer
the protective emblem to other dimensions of transmission and representation.
(Fully) Autonomous weapon systems are often launched from a great distance to
the aiming point and there may be no possibility for the operators to notice
protective emblems at the point of impact. In this case, the weapon system
would have to detect such protective emblems and, if necessary, disintegrate
autonomously or request an abort via human-in-the-loop. In our paper, we
suggest ways in which a cross-frequency protective emblem can be designed. On
the one hand, the technical deployment, e.g. in the form of RADAR beacons, is
considered, as well as the interpretation by methods of machine learning. With
regard to the technical deployment, possibilities are considered to address
different sensors and to send signals out as resiliently as possible. When
considering different signals, approaches are considered as to how software can
recognise the protective emblems under the influence of various boundary
conditions and react to them accordingly. In particular, a distinction is made
here between the recognition of actively emitted signals and passive protective
signals, e.g. the recognition of wounded or surrendering persons via
drone-based electro-optical and thermal cameras. Finally, methods of
distribution are considered, including encryption and authentication of the
received signal, and ethical aspects of possible misuse are examined.

Things (IoT) have contributed to the increase in the availability and
affordability of sensing technology. In this context, Structural Health
Monitoring (SHM) arises as an especially interesting field to integrate and
develop these new sensing capabilities, given the criticality of structural
application for human life and the elevated costs of manual monitoring. Due to
the scale of structural systems, one of the main challenges when designing a
modern monitoring system is the Optimal Sensor Placement (OSP) problem. The OSP
problem is combinatorial in nature, making its exact solution infeasible in
most practical cases, usually requiring the use of meta-heuristic optimization
techniques. While approaches such as genetic algorithms (GA) have been able to
produce significant results in many practical case studies, their ability to
scale up to more complex structures is still an area of open research. This
study proposes a novel quantum-based combinatorial optimization approach to
solve the OSP problem approximately, within the context of SHM. For this
purpose, a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model formulation
is developed, taking as a starting point the modal strain energy (MSE) of the
structure. The framework is tested using numerical simulations from two
relevant structures: a multi-story shear building and a Warren truss bridge.
The results obtained using the proposed framework are compared against
exhaustive search approaches to verify their approximation ratios. More
importantly, a detailed discussion of the current limitations of the technology
and the future paths of research in the area is presented to the reader.

through multiple independent stages. In viral replication, for example, virions
enter a cell to undergo a complex process comprising several disparate stages
before the eventual accumulation and release of replicated virions. While such
systems may have some control over the internal dynamics that make up this
progression, a challenge for many is to regulate behaviour under what are often
highly variable external environments acting as system inputs. In this work, we
study a simple analogue of this problem through a linear multicompartment model
subject to a stochastic input in the form of a mean-reverting
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a type of Gaussian process. By expressing the
system as a multidimensional Gaussian process, we derive several closed-form
analytical results relating to the covariances and autocorrelations of the
system, quantifying the smoothing effect discrete compartments afford
multicompartment systems. Semi-analytical results demonstrate that feedback and
feedforward loops can enhance system robustness, and simulation results probe
the intractable problem of the first passage time distribution, which has
specific relevance to eventual cell lysis in the viral replication cycle.
Finally, we demonstrate that the smoothing seen in the process is a consequence
of the discreteness of the system, and does not manifest in an equivalent
continuum limit description. While we make progress through analysis of a
simple linear problem, many of our insights are applicable more generally, and
our work enables future analysis into multicompartment processes subject to
stochastic inputs.

theories is an active area of research with deep connections to fundamental
aspects of the scattering theory of integrable quantum field theories,
generalised Gibbs ensembles, and string theory. Many features of these
theories, such as the peculiar behaviour of their ground state energy and the
form of their scattering matrices, have been studied in the literature.
However, so far, very few studies have approached these theories from the
viewpoint of the form factor program. From the perspective of scattering
theory, the effects of a $\mathrm{T}\overline{\mathrm{T}}$ perturbation (and
higher spin versions thereof) is encoded in a universal deformation of the
two-body scattering matrix by a CDD factor. It is then natural to ask how these
perturbations influence the form factor equations and, more generally, the form
factor program. In this paper, we address this question for free theories,
although some of our results extend more generally. We show that the form
factor equations admit general solutions and how these can help us study the
distinct behaviour of correlation functions at short distances in theories
perturbed by irrelevant operators.

undetected by deep JWST imaging observations, supporting the effectiveness of
ALMA in detecting dust obscured sources especially in the vicinity of optically

simply unavailable to a would-be algorithm. This raises a natural question
whether human experts add value which could not be captured by an algorithmic
predictor. We develop a statistical framework under which we can pose this
question as a natural hypothesis test. Indeed, as our framework highlights,
detecting human expertise is more subtle than simply comparing the accuracy of
expert predictions to those made by a particular learning algorithm. Instead,
we propose a simple procedure which tests whether expert predictions are
statistically independent from the outcomes of interest after conditioning on
the available inputs (`features'). A rejection of our test thus suggests that
human experts may add value to any algorithm trained on the available data, and
has direct implications for whether human-AI `complementarity' is achievable in

and temporal spectrum sharing in a variety of contexts, including cognitive
spectrum sharing (CSS). However, CSS along with omnidirectional sensing, is not
efficient at mmWave frequencies due to their directional nature of
transmission, as this limits secondary networks' ability to access the
spectrum. This inspired us to create an analytical approach using stochastic
geometry to examine the implications of directional cognitive sensing in mmWave
networks. We explore a scenario where multiple secondary transmitter-receiver
pairs coexist with a primary transmitter-receiver pair, forming a cognitive
network. The positions of the secondary transmitters are modelled using a
homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) with corresponding secondary receivers
located around them. A threshold on directional transmission is imposed on each
secondary transmitter in order to limit its interference at the primary
receiver. We derive the medium-access-probability of a secondary user along
with the fraction of the secondary transmitters active at a time-instant. To
understand cognition's feasibility, we derive the coverage probabilities of
primary and secondary links. We provide various design insights via numerical
results. For example, we investigate the interference-threshold's optimal value
while ensuring coverage for both links and its dependence on various
parameters. We find that directionality improves both links' performance as a
key factor. Further, allowing location-aware secondary directionality can help
achieve similar coverage for all secondary links.

that many of these planets contain a large amount of heavy elements, in sharp
contrast with the expectations of the conventional core-accretion model for the
origin of giant planets.
  Aims: The proposed explanations for the heavy-element enrichment of giant
planets fall short of explaining the most enriched planets. We look for
additional processes that can explain the full envelope of inferred
enrichments.
  Methods: We revisit the dynamics of pebbles and dust in the vicinity of giant
planets using analytic estimates. Although our results are derived in the
framework of a viscous alpha-disk we also discuss the case of disks driven by
angular momentum removal in magnetized winds.
  Results: When giant planets are far from the star, dust and pebbles are
confined in a pressure bump at the outer edge of the planet-induced gap.
Instead, when the planets reach the inner part of the disk (r << 2 au), dust
penetrates the gap together with the gas. The dust/gas ratio can be enhanced by
more than an order of magnitude if radial drift of dust is not impeded farther
out by other barriers. Thus, hot planets undergoing runaway gas accretion can
swallow a large amount of dust.
  Conclusions: Whereas the gas accreted by giant planets in the outer disk is
very dust-poor, that accreted by hot planets can be extremely dust-rich. Thus,
provided that a large fraction of the atmosphere of hot-Jupiters is accreted in
situ, a large amount of dust can be accreted as well. We draw a distinction
between this process and pebble accretion, which is ineffective at small
stellocentric radii, even for super-Earths. Giant planets farther out in the
disk are extremely effective barriers against the flow of pebbles and dust
across their gap.

This setting includes crowdsourcing and programmatic weak supervision. We focus
on the non-stationary case, where the accuracy of the weak supervision sources
can drift over time, e.g., because of changes in the underlying data
distribution. Due to the drift, older data could provide misleading information
to infer the label of the current data point. Previous work relied on a priori
assumptions on the magnitude of the drift to decide how much data to use from
the past. Comparatively, our algorithm does not require any assumptions on the
drift, and it adapts based on the input. In particular, at each step, our
algorithm guarantees an estimation of the current accuracies of the weak
supervision sources over a window of past observations that minimizes a
trade-off between the error due to the variance of the estimation and the error
due to the drift. Experiments on synthetic and real-world labelers show that
our approach indeed adapts to the drift. Unlike fixed-window-size strategies,
it dynamically chooses a window size that allows it to consistently maintain

characterize wave functions that are invariant under discrete rotations. For a
chiral system with screw symmetry, the rotational invariance is broken and the
Bloch orbital angular momentum is generally not acknowledged. Here, we show
that the wave functions of Bloch electrons in such a chiral system, denoted as
helical electrons, are helical or vortex waves and, therefore, have
well-defined orbital angular momentum along the screw axis. The collinear
orbital-momentum locking imposed by the screw-induced orbital helicity leads to
the orbital-selective transport as illustrated by tight-binding model
calculations. We verify the helical states and orbital selectivity for two real
chiral materials, namely, peptide helix and trigonal Se, by first-principles
band structure calculations. Finally, we show that the interconversion between
the orbital angular momentum and spin angular momentum at the chiral-achiral
interfaces together with the orbital selectivity of the propagating helical
electrons provide a fundamental principle for the chiral induced spin
selectivity. Our understandings of the screw symmetry induced orbital angular
momentum in chiral materials and the interplay between orbital angular momentum
and spin angular momentum at the chiral-achiral interface paves a way for
designing orbitronics and spintronics with chiral materials.

scam, the Ponzi scheme, has also emerged in the blockchain platform Ethereum.
This Ponzi scheme deployed through smart contracts, also known as the smart
Ponzi scheme, has caused a lot of economic losses and negative impacts.
Existing methods for detecting smart Ponzi schemes on Ethereum mainly rely on
bytecode features, opcode features, account features, and transaction behavior
features of smart contracts, and such methods lack interpretability and
sustainability. In this paper, we propose SourceP, a method to detect smart
Ponzi schemes on the Ethereum platform using pre-training models and data flow,
which only requires using the source code of smart contracts as features to
explore the possibility of detecting smart Ponzi schemes from another
direction. SourceP reduces the difficulty of data acquisition and feature
extraction of existing detection methods while increasing the interpretability
of the model. Specifically, we first convert the source code of a smart
contract into a data flow graph and then introduce a pre-training model based
on learning code representations to build a classification model to identify
Ponzi schemes in smart contracts. The experimental results show that SourceP
achieves 87.2\% recall and 90.7\% F-score for detecting smart Ponzi schemes
within Ethereum's smart contract dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in terms of performance and sustainability. We also demonstrate through
additional experiments that pre-training models and data flow play an important
contribution to SourceP, as well as proving that SourceP has a good
generalization ability.

often necessary to optimize their performance. However, a major obstacle is the
limited availability of labeled data. We study the use of pseudolabels, i.e.,
heuristic labels for unlabeled data, to enhance CLIP via prompt tuning.
Conventional pseudolabeling trains a model on labeled data and then generates
labels for unlabeled data. VLMs' zero-shot capabilities enable a ``second
generation'' of pseudolabeling approaches that do not require task-specific
training on labeled data. By using zero-shot pseudolabels as a source of
supervision, we observe that learning paradigms such as semi-supervised,
transductive zero-shot, and unsupervised learning can all be seen as optimizing
the same loss function. This unified view enables the development of versatile
training strategies that are applicable across learning paradigms. We
investigate them on image classification tasks where CLIP exhibits limitations,
by varying prompt modalities, e.g., textual or visual prompts, and learning
paradigms. We find that (1) unexplored prompt tuning strategies that
iteratively refine pseudolabels consistently improve CLIP accuracy, by 19.5
points in semi-supervised learning, by 28.4 points in transductive zero-shot
learning, and by 15.2 points in unsupervised learning, and (2) unlike
conventional semi-supervised pseudolabeling, which exacerbates model biases
toward classes with higher-quality pseudolabels, prompt tuning leads to a more
equitable distribution of per-class accuracy. The code to reproduce the

by prohibitive scaling costs and therefore quantum computers offer a unique
opportunity for extending their use to larger systems. Here, we propose a
quantum algorithm for the simulation of the time-evolution of molecular systems

slow and fast components, we show how the entanglement between the electronic

challenge to the governments and health sectors on a global scale. To
facilitate informed public health decision-making, the concerned parties
usually rely on short-term daily and weekly projections generated via
predictive modeling. Several deterministic and stochastic epidemiological
models, including growth and compartmental models, have been proposed in the
literature. These models assume that an epidemic would last over a short
duration and the observed cases/deaths would attain a single peak. However,
some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, extend over a longer duration than
expected. Moreover, time-varying disease transmission rates due to government
interventions have made the observed data multi-modal. To address these
challenges, this work proposes stochastic epidemiological models under a
unified Bayesian framework augmented by a change-point detection mechanism to
account for multiple peaks. The Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate
prior knowledge, such as dates of influential policy changes, to predict the
change-point locations precisely. We develop a trans-dimensional reversible

the resulting parameters. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to

resolution; 0.7 pc). In this first data release we present dust polarization
observations covering a ~0.5degree region of the Galactic Center's Central
Molecular Zone (CMZ), centered on the Sgr B2 complex. We detect ~25,000
Nyquist-sampled polarization pseudovectors, after applying the standard SOFIA
cuts for minimum signal-to-noise in fractional polarization and total intensity
of 3 and 200, respectively. Analysis of the magnetic field orientation suggests
a bimodal distribution in the field direction. This bimodal distribution shows
enhancements in the distribution of field directions for orientations parallel
and perpendicular to the Galactic plane, which is suggestive of a CMZ magnetic
field configuration with polodial and torodial components. Furthermore, a
detailed analysis of individual clouds included in our survey (i.e., Sgr B2,
Sgr B2-NW, Sgr B2-Halo, Sgr B1, and Clouds-E/F) shows these clouds have
fractional polarization values of 1-10% at 214-micron, with most of the
emission having values <5%. A few of these clouds (i.e., Sgr B2, Clouds-E/F)
show relatively low fractional polarization values toward the cores of the
cloud, with higher fractional polarization values toward the less dense
periphery. We also observe higher fractional polarization towards compact HII
regions which could indicate an enhancement in the grain alignment in the dust
surrounding these sources.

increase with $^{12}\rm{C}\left({\alpha},{\gamma}\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate for
the same initial mass, except in the high-mass edge region. With a high (about
twice the $\texttt{STARLIB}$ standard value) rate, the maximum amount of nickel
produced falls below 70 $M_\odot$, while with a low rate (about half of the
standard value) it increases up to 83.9 $M_\odot$. These results highlight that
carbon burning plays a crucial role in PISNe by determining when a star
initiates expansion. The initiation of expansion competes with collapse caused
by helium photodisintegration, and the maximum mass that can lead to an
explosion depends on the

design method. In this respect, deep generative conditional variational
autoencoder (CVAE) models are a powerful approach for generating novel
molecules with desired drug-like properties. However, molecular graph-based
models with disentanglement and multivariate explicit latent conditioning have
not been fully elucidated. To address this, we proposed a molecular-graph
$\beta$-CVAE model for de novo drug design. Here, we empirically tuned the
value of disentanglement and assessed its ability to generate molecules with
optimised univariate- or-multivariate properties. In particular, we optimised
the octanol-water partition coefficient (ClogP), molar refractivity (CMR),
quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility score
(SAS). Results suggest that a lower $\beta$ value increases the uniqueness of
generated molecules (exploration). Univariate optimisation results showed our
model generated molecular property averages of ClogP = 41.07% $\pm$ 0.01% and
CMR 66.76% $\pm$ 0.01% by the Ghose filter. Multivariate property optimisation
results showed that our model generated an average of 30.07% $\pm$ 0.01%
molecules for both desired properties. Furthermore, our model improved the QED
and SAS (exploitation) of molecules generated. Together, these results suggest
that the $\beta$-CVAE could balance exploration and exploitation through
disentanglement and is a promising model for de novo drug design, thus
providing a basis for future studies.

sensitive training data by ensuring that ML models will not reveal private

sensitive dataset to generate a new synthetic dataset which is differentially
private with respect to the original data. Doing so has several advantages:
synthetic data can be reused for other tasks (including for hyper parameter
tuning), retained indefinitely, or shared with third parties without
sacrificing privacy.
  However, obtaining DP data is much harder than introducing DP during
training. To make it feasible for text, recent work has utilized public data by
starting with a pre-trained generative language model and privately finetuning
it on sensitive data. This model can be used to sample a DP synthetic dataset.
While this strategy seems straightforward, executing it has proven problematic.
Previous approaches either show significant performance loss, or have, as we
show, critical design flaws.
  In this paper we demonstrate that a proper training objective along with
tuning fewer parameters results in excellent DP synthetic data quality. Our
approach is competitive with direct DP-training of downstream classifiers in
terms of performance on downstream tasks. We also demonstrate that our DP
synthetic data is not only useful for downstream classifier training, but also
to tune those same models.

properties of deep neural networks (DNNs). Second-order techniques, while
enjoying higher convergence rates vs first-order counterparts, have cubic
complexity with respect to either the model size and/or the training batch
size. Hence they exhibit poor scalability and performance in transformer
models, e.g. large language models (LLMs), because the batch sizes in these
models scale by the attention mechanism sequence length, leading to large model
size and batch sizes. MKOR's complexity is quadratic with respect to the model
size, alleviating the computation bottlenecks in second-order methods. Because
of their high computation complexity, state-of-the-art implementations of
second-order methods can only afford to update the second order information
infrequently, and thus do not fully exploit the promise of better convergence
from these updates. By reducing the communication complexity of the
second-order updates as well as achieving a linear communication complexity,
MKOR increases the frequency of second order updates. We also propose a hybrid
version of MKOR (called MKOR-H) that mid-training falls backs to a first order

modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) near and away from Fe vacancy
defects separately, we can identify quasiparticle interference (QPI) signals
originating from multiple regions of the Brillouin zone, including the bands at
the M and A points. We also observe that QPI signals coexist with a much
stronger LDOS modulation for states near the Fermi level whose period is
independent of energy. Our measurements further reveal that this strong pattern
appears in the STS measurements as short range stripe patterns that are locally
two-fold symmetric. Since these stripe patterns coexist with four-fold
symmetric QPI around Fe-vacancies, the origin of their local two-fold symmetry
must be distinct from that of nematic states in orthorhombic samples. To
further understand these stripe patterns, we explore several aspects related to
them, such as the role of S and Fe vacancy defects, and whether they can be
explained by QPI. We consider the possibility that the observed stripe patterns
may represent incipient charge order correlations, similar to those observed in
the cuprates.

Model (CMEM) to show that the optimal speed and the greenest path are slope
dependent (dynamic). When there are no elevation changes in a road network, the
most fuel-efficient path is the shortest path with a constant (static) optimal
speed throughout. However, if the network is not flat, then the shortest path
is not necessarily the greenest path, and the optimal driving speed is dynamic.
We prove that the greenest path converges to an asymptotic greenest path as the
payload approaches infinity and that this limiting path is attained for a
finite load. In a set of extensive numerical experiments, we benchmark the CO2
emissions reduction of our dynamic speed and the greenest path policies against
policies that ignore elevation data. We use the geo-spatial data of 25 major
cities across 6 continents, such as Los Angeles, Mexico City, Johannesburg,
Athens, Ankara, and Canberra. Our results show that, on average, traversing the
greenest path with a dynamic optimal speed policy can reduce the CO2 emissions
by 1.19% to 10.15% depending on the city and truck type for a moderate payload.
They also demonstrate that the average CO2 reduction of the optimal dynamic
speed policy is between 2% to 4% for most of the cities, regardless of the
truck type. We confirm that disregarding elevation data yields sub-optimal
paths that are significantly less CO2 efficient than the greenest paths.

localize using a Bayesian-PRP formulation that also incorporates an explicit

require minimal training. PRP can achieve meter level accuracy with just 6

auto-correlation signal of a photo-$z$ sample. We also quantify the

Representation bias can exist with respect to different groups of one or more
protected attributes and might lead to prejudicial and discriminatory outcomes
toward certain groups of individuals; in cases where a learning model is
trained on such biased data. This paper presents MASC, a data augmentation
approach that leverages affinity clustering to balance the representation of
non-protected and protected groups of a target dataset by utilizing instances
of the same protected attributes from similar datasets that are categorized in
the same cluster as the target dataset by sharing instances of the protected
attribute. The proposed method involves constructing an affinity matrix by
quantifying distribution discrepancies between dataset pairs and transforming
them into a symmetric pairwise similarity matrix. A non-parametric spectral
clustering is then applied to this affinity matrix, automatically categorizing
the datasets into an optimal number of clusters. We perform a step-by-step
experiment as a demo of our method to show the procedure of the proposed data
augmentation method and evaluate and discuss its performance. A comparison with
other data augmentation methods, both pre- and post-augmentation, is conducted,
along with a model evaluation analysis of each method. Our method can handle
non-binary protected attributes so, in our experiments, bias is measured in a
non-binary protected attribute setup w.r.t. racial groups distribution for two
separate minority groups in comparison with the majority group before and after
debiasing. Empirical results imply that our method of augmenting dataset biases
using real (genuine) data from similar contexts can effectively debias the

system where the effects of spin-conserving and spin-flip scattering can be
studied in a controlled way, namely NbSe$_2$ monolayers dozed with magnetic
$3d$ atoms. We predict that the critical temperature is slightly increased by
an in-plane magnetic field in NbSe$_2$ dozed with Cr. Due to the band spin
splitting, magnetic spin-flip scattering requires a finite momentum transfer,
while spin-conserving scattering does not. If the magnetic anisotropy is
easy-axis, an in-plane field reorients the impurity spins and transforms
spin-conserving scattering into spin-flip. The critical temperature is enhanced
if the induced magnetization of NbSe$_2$ has a substantial long-range

micromechanics models generally do not account for excluded volume interactions

excluded volume interactions on the mechanical response. The approach is based
on the framework of the self-consistent statistical field theory of polymers,
which provides an efficient mesoscale approach that enables the accounting of
excluded volume effects without the expense of large-scale molecular modeling.
A mesoscale representative volume element is populated with multiple
interacting chains, and the macroscale nonlinear elastic deformation is imposed
by mapping the end-to-end vectors of the chains by this deformation. In the
absence of excluded volume interactions, it recovers the closed-form results of
the classical theory of rubber elasticity. With excluded volume interactions,
the model is solved numerically in three dimensions using a finite element
method to obtain the energy, stresses, and linearized moduli under imposed
macroscale deformation. Highlights of the numerical study include: (i) the
linearized Poisson's ratio is very close to the incompressible limit without a
phenomenological imposition of incompressibility; (ii) despite the harmonic
Gaussian chain as a starting point, there is an emergent strain-softening and
strain-stiffening response that is characteristic of real polymer networks,
driven by the interplay between the entropy and the excluded volume
interactions; and (iii) the emergence of a deformation-sensitive localization
instability at large excluded volumes.

techniques: input-level alignment (such as generative modeling and stylization)
and feature-level alignment (which matches the distribution of the feature
maps, e.g. gradient reversal layers). Motivated from the success of generative
modeling for image classification, stylization-based methods were recently
proposed for regression tasks, such as pose estimation. However, use of
input-level alignment via generative modeling and stylization incur additional
overhead and computational complexity which limit their use in real-world DA
tasks. To investigate the role of input-level alignment for DA, we ask the
following question: Is generative modeling-based stylization necessary for
visual domain adaptation in regression? Surprisingly, we find that
input-alignment has little effect on regression tasks as compared to
classification. Based on these insights, we develop a non-parametric
feature-level domain alignment method -- Implicit Stylization (ImSty) -- which
results in consistent improvements over SOTA regression task, without the need
for computationally intensive stylization and generative modeling. Our work
conducts a critical evaluation of the role of generative modeling and

downstream performance, faster convergence, and better sample efficiency. These
advantages have led to a proliferation of task-specific fine-tuned models,
which typically can only perform a single task and do not benefit from one
another. Recently, model merging techniques have emerged as a solution to
combine multiple task-specific models into a single multitask model without
performing additional training. However, existing merging methods often ignore
the interference between parameters of different models, resulting in large
performance drops when merging multiple models. In this paper, we demonstrate
that prior merging techniques inadvertently lose valuable information due to
two major sources of interference: (a) interference due to redundant parameter
values and (b) disagreement on the sign of a given parameter's values across
models. To address this, we propose our method, TrIm, Elect Sign & Merge
(TIES-Merging), which introduces three novel steps when merging models: (1)
resetting parameters that only changed a small amount during fine-tuning, (2)
resolving sign conflicts, and (3) merging only the parameters that are in
alignment with the final agreed-upon sign. We find that TIES-Merging
outperforms several existing methods in diverse settings covering a range of

only in individual languages. For such purposes, the MMTs' language coverage
makes them unnecessarily expensive to deploy in terms of model size, inference
time, energy, and hardware cost. We thus propose to extract compressed,
language-specific models from MMTs which retain the capacity of the original
MMTs for cross-lingual transfer. This is achieved by distilling the MMT
bilingually, i.e., using data from only the source and target language of
interest. Specifically, we use a two-phase distillation approach, termed
BiStil: (i) the first phase distils a general bilingual model from the MMT,
while (ii) the second, task-specific phase sparsely fine-tunes the bilingual
""student"" model using a task-tuned variant of the original MMT as its
""teacher"". We evaluate this distillation technique in zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer across a number of standard cross-lingual benchmarks. The key results
indicate that the distilled models exhibit minimal degradation in target
language performance relative to the base MMT despite being significantly
smaller and faster. Furthermore, we find that they outperform multilingually
distilled models such as DistilmBERT and MiniLMv2 while having a very modest
training budget in comparison, even on a per-language basis. We also show that

$\textit{Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness}$

response to mechanical loading and can often accommodate substantial plastic

produce desirable behavior, such as increased ductility, or undesirable
behavior such as mechanically-induced coarsening. In this work a novel,
multiscale model is developed for capturing the combined effect of plasticity
mediated by multiple GBs simultaneously. This model is referred to as ""network
plasticity"" (NP). The mathematical framework of graph theory is used to
describe the microstructure connectedness, and the evolution of microstructure
is represented as volume flow along the graph. By using the principle of
minimum dissipation potential, which has previously been applied to grain
boundary migration, a set of evolution equations are developed that transfer
volume and eigendeformation along the graph edges in a physically consistent
way. It is shown that higher-order geometric effects, such as the pinning
effect of triple points, may be accounted for through the incorporation of a
geometric hardening that causes geometry-induced GB stagnation. The result is a
computationally efficient reduced order model that can be used to simulate the
initial motion of grain boundaries in a polycrystal with parameters informed by
atomistic simulations. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through
comparison to multiple bicrystal atomistic simulations, as well as a select
number of GB engineered and non-GB engineered data obtained from the
literature. The network plastic effect is demonstrated through mechanical
response tests and by examining the yield surfaces, and the transition from NP

investigated in this study. The organic molecule considered is mandelic acid,

process. Reaction conditions, purity of the components, supersaturation,
temperature, but possibly also temperature gradients play a central role during
crystal growth. In this study a numerical model based on a hybrid solver
combining the lattice Boltzmann method with finite differences is developed to
model the crystallization dynamics of (S)-mandelic acid (S-ma) taking
quantitatively into account temperature effects. At first, the fourth-order
finite-difference method used to model energy and species conservation is
validated. Then, comparisons are carried out regarding temperature changes
within the single-crystal growth cell. In practice, the molar heat generation
at the crystal interface shows only a small effect on the temperature field in
the surrounding domain, with temperature differences below $1.5$ degree.
Finally, the study is extended to investigate the impact of forced convection
on the crystal habits while taking into account temperature differences.

often called ""asymptotic"" tensor parameters, play a central role in several
areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix
multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and
distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets,
sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic
slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai,
Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated
notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or ""gaps"" in the values of
such tensor parameters.
  We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of
order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field, the
asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points,
and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation
points.
  Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic
subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The
first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor
is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound
says that any three-tensor that is ""narrow enough"" (has one dimension much
smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
  Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces
that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions.
We prove that for any concise tensor the product of any two such maximum ranks
must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions
with large max-rank.

twist angle ${\sim}3.6^\circ$. The CFL is a non-Fermi liquid phase that shows
metallic behavior despite the absence of Landau quasiparticles. We discuss
experimental implications including the competition between the CFL and a Fermi
liquid, which can be tuned with a displacement field. The topological valence

small bandwidth that is, remarkably, reduced by interactions for a range of

revealed several important findings, including: (1) a simple integration of
diffusion models into semantic segmentation is not sufficient, and a
poorly-designed diffusion process might lead to degradation in segmentation
performance; (2) during the training, the object to which noise is added is
more important than the type of noise; (3) during the inference, the strict

$c_{k}$-treewidth modulators to some surface of Euler-genus $c_{k}.$ This
reveals that minor-exclusion is essentially tree-decomposability to a
``modulator-target scheme'' where the modulator is measured by its treewidth
and the target is surface embeddability. We then fix the target condition by
demanding that $\Sigma$ is some particular surface and define a ``surface

on the assumption that the classifiers make independent errors. The first is
based on majority voting. The second, the main contribution of the paper, is
guaranteed to be correct. But how do we know the classifiers are independent on
any given test? This principal/agent monitoring paradox is ameliorated by
exploiting the failures of the independent evaluator to return sensible
estimates. A search for nearly error independent trios is empirically carried
out on the \texttt{adult}, \texttt{mushroom}, and \texttt{two-norm} datasets by
using the algebraic failure modes to reject evaluation ensembles as too
correlated. The searches are refined by constructing a surface in evaluation
space that contains the true value point. The algebra of arbitrarily correlated
classifiers permits the selection of a polynomial subset free of any
correlation variables. Candidate evaluation ensembles are rejected if their
data sketches produce independent estimates too far from the constructed
surface. The results produced by the surviving ensembles can sometimes be as
good as 1\%. But handling even small amounts of correlation remains a
challenge. A Taylor expansion of the estimates produced when independence is
assumed but the classifiers are, in fact, slightly correlated helps clarify how

OCBEV, which can carve the temporal and spatial cues of moving targets more
effectively. OCBEV comprises three designs: Object Aligned Temporal Fusion
aligns the BEV feature based on ego-motion and estimated current locations of
moving objects, leading to a precise instance-level feature fusion. Object
Focused Multi-View Sampling samples more 3D features from an adaptive local
height ranges of objects for each scene to enrich foreground information.
Object Informed Query Enhancement replaces part of pre-defined decoder queries

high-confidence locations, introducing more direct object positional priors.
Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted on the challenging nuScenes

Here we introduce Counterfactual World Modeling (CWM), a framework for

can be prompted to perform a wide variety of visual computations. CWM has two
key components, which resolve the core issues that have hindered application of
the foundation model concept to vision. The first is structured masking, a
generalization of masked prediction methods that encourages a prediction model
to capture the low-dimensional structure in visual data. The model thereby
factors the key physical components of a scene and exposes an interface to them
via small sets of visual tokens. This in turn enables CWM's second main idea --
counterfactual prompting -- the observation that many apparently distinct
visual representations can be computed, in a zero-shot manner, by comparing the
prediction model's output on real inputs versus slightly modified
(""counterfactual"") inputs. We show that CWM generates high-quality readouts on
real-world images and videos for a diversity of tasks, including estimation of
keypoints, optical flow, occlusions, object segments, and relative depth. Taken
together, our results show that CWM is a promising path to unifying the

binary SMBHs, which form following galaxy mergers, is expected to produce a
gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs).
PTAs are starting to see hints of what may be a GWB, and the amplitude of the
emerging signal is towards the higher end of model predictions. Simulated
populations of binary SMBHs can be constructed from observations of galaxies
and are used to make predictions about the nature of the GWB. The greatest
source of uncertainty in these observation-based models comes from the
inference of the SMBH mass function, which is derived from observed host galaxy
properties. In this paper, I undertake a new approach for inferring the SMBH
mass function starting from a velocity dispersion function rather than a galaxy
stellar mass function. I argue that this method allows for a more direct
inference by relying on a larger suite of individual galaxy observations as
well as relying on a more ""fundamental"" SMBH mass relation. I find that the

redshifts than previous models. Additionally, I explore the implications for
the detection of individually resolvable sources in PTA data.

upcoming follow-up searches. We outline a semi-analytical model that connects
the optical lightcurve properties to the SN parameters and find that a large
peak luminosity ($ L_{\rm{peak}}\gtrsim 10^{43}$-$10^{44}$ erg) and an average
rise time ($t_{\rm{rise}}\gtrsim 10$-$40$ days) are necessary for copious
neutrino emission. Nevertheless, the most promising $ L_{\rm{peak}}$ and
$t_{\rm{rise}}$ are not sufficient to guarantee ideal conditions for neutrino
detection. Comparable optical properties can be obtained for SN configurations
that are not optimal for neutrino emission. Such ambiguous correspondence
between the optical lightcurve properties and the number of IceCube neutrino
events implies that relying on optical observations only, a range of expected
neutrino events should be considered (e.g. the expected number of neutrino
events can vary up to two orders of magnitude for some among the brightest SNe
IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility up to now, SN 2020usa and SN
2020in). In addition, the peak in the high-energy neutrino curve should be
expected a few $t_{\rm{rise}}$ after the peak in the optical lightcurve. Our

in the comparison is the degree of alteration of the asteroids with respect to
the meteorites expressed via an exponential model. We derive an absolute scale
of similarity between the spectra using laboratory data from irradiation
experiments. CVOxA chondrites are the best match to the asteroids, in
particular to K-type (7 out of 11 asteroids matched) and Barbarians (11 out of

Barbarians (7 out of 16) as well. A single non-Barbarian L-type is matched to a

leveraged to construct quantum memories and have potential applications in
quantum information processing. Solid state and cold atom experimental
architectures have opened avenues for implementing local Floquet engineering
which can achieve spatially modulated quantum control of states. Here, we
uncover the novel memory effects of local periodic driving in a nonintegrable
spin-half staggered Heisenberg chain. For a boundary-driven protocol at the
dynamical freezing frequency, we show the formation of an approximate strong
zero mode, a prethermal quasi-local operator, due to the emergence of a
discrete global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. This is captured by constructing an
accurate effective Floquet Hamiltonian using a higher-order partially resummed
Floquet-Magnus expansion. The lifetime of the boundary spin can be
exponentially enhanced by enlarging the set of suitably chosen driven sites. We
demonstrate that in the asymptotic limit, achieved by increasing the number of
driven sites, a strong zero mode emerges, where the lifetime of the boundary
spin grows exponentially with system size. The non-local processes in the
Floquet Hamiltonian play a pivotal role in the total freezing of the boundary
spin in the thermodynamic limit. The novel dynamics of the boundary spin is
accompanied by a rich structure of entanglement in the Floquet eigenstates
where specific bipartitions yield an area-law scaling while the entanglement
for random bipartitions scales as a volume-law.

the entropy of states on which this algebra acts is UV finite, and we find that
it agrees, up to a state-independent constant, with the generalized entropy.
For spatially compact regions the algebra is type II$_1$, implying the
existence of an entropy maximizing state, which realizes a version of
Jacobson's entanglement equilibrium hypothesis. The construction relies on the

being 16x more efficient. Our binary model, while less accurate, achieves a

successful maximum likelihood training of unconstrained autoencoders for the

overcome two challenges: Firstly, existing maximum likelihood estimators for
free-form networks are unacceptably slow, relying on iteration schemes whose
cost scales linearly with latent dimension. We introduce an improved estimator

runtime per batch of a vanilla autoencoder). Secondly, we demonstrate that
naively applying maximum likelihood to autoencoders can lead to divergent

Here, we use the nearsighted-force training approach to make high-fidelity
machine-learned predictions on large nanoparticles with $>$5,000 atoms using
only systematically generated small structures ranging from 38-168 atoms. The
resulting ensemble model shows good accuracy and transferability in describing
relative energetics for CoPt nanoparticles with various shapes, sizes and Co
compositions. It is found that the fcc(100) surface is more likely to form a
L1$_0$ ordered structure than the fcc(111) surface. The energy convex hull of
the icosahedron shows the most stable particles have Pt-rich skins and Co-rich
underlayers. Although the truncated octahedron is the most stable shape across
all sizes of Pt nanoparticles, a crossover to icosahedron exists due to a large
downshift of surface energy for CoPt nanoparticle alloys. The downshift can be
attributed to strain release on the icosahedron surface due to Co alloying. We
introduced a simple empirical model to describe the role of Co alloying in the
crossover for CoPt nanoparticles. With Monte-Carlo simulations we additionally
searched for the most stable atomic arrangement for a truncated octahedron with
equal Pt and Co compositions, and also we studied its order-disorder phase
transition. We validated the most stable configurations with a new highly

order-disorder phase transition for a CoPt nanoparticle exhibits a lower

shock is sharp and well defined, consistent with magneto-hydrodynamic theory.
In contrast, we do not observe a well-defined shock using tungsten wires,

registration are performed to transfer patient abdominal volumes to a fixed
high-resolution atlas template. To generate and evaluate the pancreas atlas
template, multi-contrast modality CT scans of 443 subjects (without reported
history of pancreatic disease, age: 15-50 years old) are processed. Comparing
with different registration state-of-the-art tools, the combination of DEEDs
affine and non-rigid registration achieves the best performance for the
pancreas label transfer across all contrast phases. We further perform external
evaluation with another research cohort of 100 de-identified portal venous

our framework, the connectivity constraints are expressed by a simple graph of

comparisons for eliciting information from the bidder, arguably easier for
humans than assigning a numerical value. Our mechanism chooses allocations
using an epsilon-greedy strategy and relies on pairwise comparisons between
realized utility from allocated goods and an arbitrary value, avoiding the
learning-to-bid problem explored in previous work. We prove this mechanism to
be asymptotically truthful, individually rational, and welfare and revenue

security threats that exploit the non-volatile property. Compared to volatile

mainly based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), which incurs significant
performance and power overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight memory
encryption/decryption scheme by exploiting in-situ memory operations with
negligible overhead. To validate the feasibility of the encryption/decryption
scheme, device-level and array-level experiments are performed using
ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET) as an example NVM without loss of

evaluate the performance of our scheme over the AES-based scheme when deploying
different neural network workloads. Our scheme yields significant latency

asymptotic semiclassical analysis of partial differential equations.
Semiclassical theory yields the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the complex phase
factor and the transport equation for the amplitude. These two equations can be
combined to form a nonlinear semiclassical version of the KvH equation in
configuration space. Every solution of the configuration space KvH equation
satisfies both the semiclassical phase space KvH equation and the
Hamilton-Jacobi constraint. For configuration space solutions, this constraint
resolves the paradox that there are two different conserved densities in phase
space. For integrable systems, the KvH spectrum is the Cartesian product of a
classical and a semiclassical spectrum. If the classical spectrum is
eliminated, then, with the correct choice of Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
(JWKB) matching conditions, the semiclassical spectrum satisfies the
Einstein-Brillouin-Keller quantization conditions which include the correction
due to the Maslov index. However, semiclassical analysis uses different choices
for boundary conditions, continuity requirements, and the domain of definition.
For example, use of the complex JWKB method allows for the treatment of
tunneling through the complexification of phase space. Finally, although KvH
wavefunctions include the possibility of interference effects, interference is
not observable when all observables are approximated as local operators on
phase space. Observing interference effects requires consideration of nonlocal
operations, e.g. through higher orders in the asymptotic theory.

propagating in the terrestrial magnetosphere at lower wavenormal angles than
predicted by linear Vlasov theory of electron-proton plasmas. To explain these

this region may have strong, non-trivial effects that allow Alfv\'enic waves to
acquire right-handed polarization at lower angles with respect to the
background magnetic field, as in the case of typical electron-proton plasma.
Aims. We study the dispersion properties of Alfv\'enic waves in plasmas with
stationary phase-space distribution functions with different heavy ion
populations. Our extensive numerical analysis has allowed us to quantify the
role of the heavy ion components on the transition from the left-hand polarized
electromagnetic ion-cyclotron (EMIC) mode to the right-hand polarized kinetic
Alfv\'en wave (KAW) mode. Methods. We used linear Vlasov-Maxwell theory to
obtain the dispersion relation for oblique electromagnetic waves. The
dispersion relation of Alfv\'en waves was obtained numerically by considering
four different oxygen ion concentrations ranging between 0.0 and 0.2 for all
propagation angles, as a function of both the wavenumber and the plasma beta
parameter. Results. The inclusion of the heavy O+ ions is found to considerably
reduce the transition angle from EMIC to KAW both as a function of the wave
number and plasma beta. With increasing O+ concentrations, waves become more
damped in specific wavenumber regions. However, the inclusion of oxygen ions
may allow weakly damped KAW to effectively propagate at smaller wave-normal
angles than in the electron-proton case, as suggested by observations.

Optimized Speed Advisory (GLOSA). The evaluation method is to first develop and
use Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulator testing, followed by extension of the
HIL testing to road testing using an experimental connected vehicle. The HIL
simulator used in the testing is a state-of-the-art simulator that consists of
the same hardware like the road side unit and traffic cabinet as is used in
real intersections and allows testing of numerous different traffic and
intersection geometry and timing scenarios realistically. First, the RLVW V2I
algorithm is tested in the HIL simulator and then implemented in an
On-Board-Unit (OBU) in our experimental vehicle and tested at real world
intersections. This same approach of HIL testing followed by testing in real
intersections using our experimental vehicle is later extended to the GLOSA
application. The GLOSA application that is tested in this paper has both an
optimal speed advisory for passing at the green light and also includes a red
light violation warning system. The paper presents the HIL and experimental
vehicle evaluation systems, information about RLVW and GLOSA and HIL simulation
and road testing results and their interpretations.

out of univariate Krawtchouk and dual Hahn polynomials. The algebra based on
the bispectral operators is also studied together with the subconstituent

the spatial correlations existing between the photons of a photon pair that has

an image of an object with light that never interacted with that object.
Depending on the imaging configuration, either position or momentum
correlations are exploited. We hereby experimentally analyse how the crystal
length and pump waist affect the image resolution when using position
correlations of photons that have been generated via spontaneous parametric
down conversion in a nonlinear interferometer. Our results support existing
theoretical models for the dependency of the resolution on the crystal length.
In addition, we probe the resolution of our quantum imaging scheme for varying
pump waists over one order of magnitude. This analysis reveals the intricate
dependency of the resolution on the strength of the correlations within the
biphoton states for parameter combinations in which the crystal lengths are
much larger than the involved photon wavelengths. We extend the existing models
in this parameter regime to properly take nontrivial effects of finite pump
waists into account and demonstrate that they match the experimental results.

the agent may have to learn online without the system ever being reset to
states the agent has seen before. In such settings, we show that deep RL agents
can diverge into unseen states from which they can never recover due to the
lack of resets, especially in highly stochastic environments. Towards
overcoming this divergence, we introduce a Lyapunov-inspired reward shaping
approach that encourages the agent to first learn to be stable (i.e. to achieve
bounded cost) and then to learn to be optimal. We theoretically show that our
reward shaping technique reduces the rate of divergence of the agent and
empirically find that it prevents it. We further combine our reward shaping

issues, we propose a method, Unlearnable Diffusion Perturbation, to safeguard

algorithm to generate sample-wise perturbation noise for each image to be

unlearnable for diffusion models, i.e., diffusion models trained or fine-tuned
on the protected data cannot generate high-quality and diverse images related
to the protected training data. Theoretically, we frame this as a max-min

enhance the effectiveness of the protective noise. We evaluate our methods on
both Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model and Latent Diffusion Models,
demonstrating that training diffusion models on the protected data lead to a
significant reduction in the quality of the generated images. Especially, the
experimental results on Stable Diffusion demonstrate that our method
effectively safeguards images from being used to train Diffusion Models in

scratch as a dataset grows in size. Given the computational expense for
retraining networks, it has been argued that continual learning could make
updating networks more efficient. An obstacle to achieving this goal is the
stability gap, which refers to an observation that when updating on new data,
performance on previously learned data degrades before recovering. Addressing
this problem would enable continual learning to learn new data with fewer
network updates, resulting in increased computational efficiency. We study how
to mitigate the stability gap in rehearsal (or experience replay), a widely
employed continual learning method. We test a variety of hypotheses to
understand why the stability gap occurs. This leads us to discover a method
that vastly reduces this gap. In experiments on a large-scale incremental class
learning setting, we are able to significantly reduce the number of network
updates to recover performance. Our work has the potential to advance the
state-of-the-art in continual learning for real-world applications along with
reducing the carbon footprint required to maintain updated neural networks.

low-layer sentence representations encode fewer unbiased features than the
highlayer ones. Based on these conclusions, we propose a simple yet effective

stack a classifier on a selected low layer. Then, we introduce a residual

to ignore the common biased features encoded by the low-layer sentence

impulsive microwave burst event recorded by the Expanded Owens Valley Solar

enhanced in situ energetic electrons recorded by both PSP at 0.37 AU and WIND

construct a distribution of preferred directions of GW emission. Our findings
indicate CCSNe do not have a single `optimal' viewing angle along which the
strongest GWs can be detected. For nonrotating cases, this dominant viewing
angle drifts isotropically throughout the supernova, set by the dynamical
timescale of the protoneutron star. For rotating cases, during core bounce and
the following tens of ms, the strongest GW signal is observed along the
equator. During the accretion phase, comparable -- if not stronger -- GW
amplitudes are generated along the axis of rotation, which can be enhanced by
the low T/|W| instability. We show two dominant factors influencing the

perspective of active learning, where the learner is endowed with the power to
decide which examples are labeled from each distribution in the collection, and
the goal is to minimize the number of label queries while maintaining
PAC-learning guarantees. Our main challenge is that standard active learning
techniques such as disagreement-based active learning do not directly apply to
the multi-group learning objective. We modify existing algorithms to provide a
consistent active learning algorithm for an agnostic formulation of multi-group
learning, which given a collection of $G$ distributions and a hypothesis class
$\mathcal{H}$ with VC-dimension $d$, outputs an $\epsilon$-optimal hypothesis
using $\tilde{O}\left( (\nu^2/\epsilon^2+1) G d \theta_{\mathcal{G}}^2

$\theta_{\mathcal{G}}$ is the worst-case disagreement coefficient over the

of standard multi-group learning in regimes where disagreement-based active
learning algorithms may be expected to succeed, and the number of groups is not
too large. We also consider the special case where each distribution in the
collection is individually realizable with respect to $\mathcal{H}$, and
demonstrate $\tilde{O}\left( G d \theta_{\mathcal{G}} \log(1/\epsilon) \right)$
label queries are sufficient for learning in this case. We further give an

multiphysics problems of the multi-region coupling type within OpenFOAM

the same name. The design of the new framework is modular, allowing users to
assemble a multiphysics problem region-by-region and coupling conditions
interface-by-interface. The present approach allows users to choose between
deploying either monolithic or partitioned interface coupling for each
individual transport equation. The formulation of boundary conditions is
generalised in the sense that their implementation is based on the mathematical
jump/transmission conditions in the most general form for tensors of any rank.
  The present contribution focuses on the underlying mathematical model for
these types of multiphysics problems, as well as on the software design and
resulting code structure that enable a flexible and modular approach. Finally,
deployment for different multi-region coupling cases is demonstrated, including
conjugate heat, multiphase flows and fuel-cells.

  signal control",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A number of deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches propose to control
traffic signals. In this work, we study the robustness of such methods along
two axes. First, sensor failures and GPS occlusions create missing-data
challenges and we show that recent methods remain brittle in the face of these
missing data. Second, we provide a more systematic study of the generalization
ability of RL methods to new networks with different traffic regimes. Again, we
identify the limitations of recent approaches. We then propose using a
combination of distributional and vanilla reinforcement learning through a
policy ensemble. Building upon the state-of-the-art previous model which uses a
decentralized approach for large-scale traffic signal control with graph
convolutional networks (GCNs), we first learn models using a distributional
reinforcement learning (DisRL) approach. In particular, we use implicit
quantile networks (IQN) to model the state-action return distribution with
quantile regression. For traffic signal control problems, an ensemble of
standard RL and DisRL yields superior performance across different scenarios,
including different levels of missing sensor data and traffic flow patterns.
Furthermore, the learning scheme of the resulting model can improve zero-shot
transferability to different road network structures, including both synthetic
networks and real-world networks (e.g., Luxembourg, Manhattan). We conduct
extensive experiments to compare our approach to multi-agent reinforcement
learning and traditional transportation approaches. Results show that the
proposed method improves robustness and generalizability in the face of missing
data, varying road networks, and traffic flows.

to the performance of various timeseries analytics tasks. However, the
quadratic time and space complexities limit Transformers' scalability,
especially for long timeseries. To address these issues, we develop a
timeseries analytics tool, RITA, which uses a novel attention mechanism, named
group attention, to address this scalability issue. Group attention dynamically
clusters the objects based on their similarity into a small number of groups
and approximately computes the attention at the coarse group granularity. It
thus significantly reduces the time and space complexity, yet provides a
theoretical guarantee on the quality of the computed attention. The dynamic
scheduler of RITA continuously adapts the number of groups and the batch size
in the training process, ensuring group attention always uses the fewest groups
needed to meet the approximation quality requirement. Extensive experiments on
various timeseries datasets and analytics tasks demonstrate that RITA
outperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and is significantly faster --
with speedups of up to 63X.

  Methods: Knee MSI datasets were retrospectively undersampled with the
proposed variable resolution sampling scheme. A U-Net model was trained to
predict the full-resolution images from the VR input. Image quality was
assessed in 10 test subjects.
  Results: Spectral bin-combined images produced with the proposed variable
resolution sampling with deep learning reconstruction appear to be of high

  Conclusion: The proposed variable resolution sampling method shows promise
for drastically reducing the time it takes to collect multi-spectral imaging

the language present in a speech signal. Existing SLR models are either too
computationally expensive or too large to run effectively on devices with

handle unseen languages outside of the target language set, yet prior work has
focused on closed-set classification where all input languages are known
a-priori. In this paper we address these two limitations: we explore efficient
model architectures for SLR based on convolutional networks, and propose a
multilabel training strategy to handle non-target languages at inference time.
Using the VoxLingua107 dataset, we show that our models obtain competitive
results while being orders of magnitude smaller and faster than current
state-of-the-art methods, and that our multilabel strategy is more robust to
unseen non-target languages compared to multiclass classification.

crystal inelastic neutron scattering measurements observe that small transverse
fields lead to a breakup of the spectrum into three parts, each evolving very
differently upon increasing field. We show that this can be naturally
understood starting from the excitations of the ordered phase of the transverse
field Ising model, domain wall quasiparticles (solitons). The transverse field
and a staggered off-diagonal exchange create one-soliton hopping terms with
opposite signs. This leads to a rich spectrum and a special field, when the
strengths of the off-diagonal exchange and transverse field match, at which
solitons become localized; the highest field investigated is very close to this
special regime. We solve this case analytically and find three two-soliton
continua, along with three novel bound states. We also present calculations
using exact diagonalization of a recently refined Hamiltonian model for
CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and using diagonalization of the two-soliton subspace, both of
which provide a quantitative agreement with the observed spectrum. The
theoretical two-soliton model qualitatively and quantitatively captures a
variety of non-trivial features in the observed spectrum, providing insight

Park et al. (Nature, 2023) suggests that publications and patents are becoming
less disruptive over time. Here we show that the reported decrease in
disruptiveness is an artifact of systematic shifts in the structure of citation
networks unrelated to innovation system capacity. Instead, the decline is
attributable to 'citation inflation', an unavoidable characteristic of real
citation networks that manifests as a systematic time-dependent bias and
renders cross-temporal analysis challenging. One driver of citation inflation
is the ever-increasing lengths of reference lists over time, which in turn
increases the density of links in citation networks, and causes the disruption
index to converge to 0. A second driver is attributable to shifts in the
construction of reference lists, which is increasingly impacted by
self-citations that increase in the rate of triadic closure in citation
networks, and thus confounds efforts to measure disruption, which is itself a
measure of triadic closure. Combined, these two systematic shifts render the
disruption index temporally biased, and unsuitable for cross-temporal analysis.
The impact of this systematic bias further stymies efforts to correlate
disruption to other measures that are also time-dependent, such as team size
and citation counts. In order to demonstrate this fundamental measurement
problem, we present three complementary lines of critique (deductive, empirical
and computational modeling), and also make available an ensemble of synthetic
citation networks that can be used to test alternative citation-based indices
for systematic bias.

within graphs, finding applications in network security, fraud detection,
social media spam detection, and various other domains. A common method for GAD
is Graph Auto-Encoders (GAEs), which encode graph data into node
representations and identify anomalies by assessing the reconstruction quality
of the graphs based on these representations. However, existing GAE models are
primarily optimized for direct link reconstruction, resulting in nodes
connected in the graph being clustered in the latent space. As a result, they
excel at detecting cluster-type structural anomalies but struggle with more
complex structural anomalies that do not conform to clusters. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel solution called GAD-NR, a new variant of GAE
that incorporates neighborhood reconstruction for graph anomaly detection.
GAD-NR aims to reconstruct the entire neighborhood of a node, encompassing the
local structure, self-attributes, and neighbor attributes, based on the
corresponding node representation. By comparing the neighborhood reconstruction
loss between anomalous nodes and normal nodes, GAD-NR can effectively detect
any anomalies. Extensive experimentation conducted on six real-world datasets
validates the effectiveness of GAD-NR, showcasing significant improvements (by
up to 30% in AUC) over state-of-the-art competitors. The source code for GAD-NR
is openly available. Importantly, the comparative analysis reveals that the
existing methods perform well only in detecting one or two types of anomalies
out of the three types studied. In contrast, GAD-NR excels at detecting all
three types of anomalies across the datasets, demonstrating its comprehensive
anomaly detection capabilities.

Often tackled via the balls-into-bins paradigm, seminal results have shown that
a limited amount of flexibility goes a long way in order to maintain
(approximately) balanced loads throughout the decision-making horizon. This
paper is motivated by the fact that balance across time is too stringent a
requirement for some applications; rather, the only desideratum is approximate
balance at the end of the horizon. In this work we design
``limited-flexibility'' algorithms for three instantiations of the
end-of-horizon balance problem: the balls-into-bins problem, opaque selling
strategies for inventory management, and parcel delivery for e-commerce
fulfillment. For the balls-into-bins model, we show that a simple policy which
begins exerting flexibility toward the end of the time horizon (i.e., when
$\Theta\left(\sqrt{T\log T}\right)$ periods remain), suffices to achieve an
approximately balanced load (i.e., a maximum load within ${O}(1)$ of the
average load). Moreover, with just a small amount of adaptivity, a threshold
policy achieves the same result, while only exerting flexibility in
${O}\left(\sqrt{T}\right)$ periods, matching a natural lower bound. We then
adapt these algorithms to develop order-wise optimal policies for the opaque
selling problem. Finally, we show via a data-driven case study that the
adaptive policy designed for the balls-into-bins model can be modified to (i)
achieve approximate balance at the end of the horizon and (ii) yield
significant cost savings relative to policies which either never exert
flexibility, or exert flexibility aggressively enough to achieve anytime
balance. The unifying motivation behind our algorithms is the observation that
exerting flexibility at the beginning of the horizon is likely wasted when
system balance is only evaluated at the end.

convoying/platooning becomes a more widely explored technology option for

cruise control (CACC), the vehicles in a convoy follow each other under
adaptive cruise control (ACC) that is augmented by the sharing of preceding
vehicle acceleration through the vehicle to vehicle communication in a
feedforward control path. In general, the desired velocity optimization for
vehicles in the convoy is based on fuel economy optimization, rather than
driveability. This paper is a preliminary study on the impact of the desired
velocity profile on the driveability characteristics of a convoy of vehicles
and the controller gain impact on the driveability. A simple low-level
longitudinal model of the vehicle has been used along with a PD type cruise
controller and a generic spacing policy for ACC/CACC. The acceleration of the
previous vehicle is available to the next vehicle as input, and the simulations
are performed as Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control of a convoy of vehicles.
Individual vehicle acceleration profiles have been analyzed for driveability
for two different velocity profiles that are followed in a stretch of 720 m
between stop signs. The controller gains have been re-tuned based on the
parameter space robust control PID approach for driveability and compared with
the original gains. The US06 SFTP drive cycle has also been used for the
comparison of the two different controller gain sets.

global power system. In order to ensure the reliable operation of the power
system, it is necessary to accurately forecast the wind speed and power of the
wind turbines. At present, deep learning is progressively applied to the wind
speed prediction. Nevertheless, the recent deep learning methods still reflect
the embarrassment for practical applications due to model interpretability and
hardware limitation. To this end, a novel deep knowledge-based learning method
is proposed in this paper. The proposed method hybridizes pre-training method
and auto-encoder structure to improve data representation and modeling of the
deep knowledge-based learning framework. In order to form knowledge and
corresponding absorbers, the original data is preprocessed by an optimization
model based on correlation to construct multi-layer networks (knowledge) which
are absorbed by sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) models. Specifically, new
cognition and memory units (CMU) are designed to reinforce traditional deep
learning framework. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is
verified by three wind prediction cases from a wind farm in Liaoning, China.
Experimental results show that the proposed method increases the stability and
training efficiency compared to the traditional LSTM method and LSTM/GRU-based
Seq2Seq method for applications of wind speed forecasting.

quadratically with the increase of image spatial resolution, which is
unfavorable to very high-resolution (VHR) RS images. Second, these popular
Transformer networks tend to ignore the importance of fine-grained features,
which results in poor edge integrity and internal tightness for largely changed

Cross-dimension Interactive Self-attention (CISA) module with linear complexity
is designed to replace the vanilla self-attention in visual Transformer, which
effectively reduces the computational complexity while improving the feature
representation ability of the proposed LSAT. Second, a Structure-aware

detail information, which can achieve double enhancement by difference
refinement and detail aggregation so as to obtain fine-grained features of
bi-temporal RS images. Experimental results show that the proposed LSAT

  For fixed confidence, we give an algorithm with expected sample complexity
$O\left(\frac{\log (1/\eta)\log (1/\delta)}{\eta\varepsilon^2}\right)$. This is

its wide real-world applications. Due to the complete absence of supervision
signals, UAD methods rely on implicit assumptions about anomalous patterns
(e.g., scattered/sparsely/densely clustered) to detect anomalies. However,
real-world data are complex and vary significantly across different domains. No
single assumption can describe such complexity and be valid in all scenarios.
This is also confirmed by recent research that shows no UAD method is
omnipotent. Based on above observations, instead of searching for a magic
universal winner assumption, we seek to design a general UAD Booster (UADB)
that empowers any UAD models with adaptability to different data. This is a
challenging task given the heterogeneous model structures and assumptions
adopted by existing UAD methods. To achieve this, we dive deep into the UAD
problem and find that compared to normal data, anomalies (i) lack clear
structure/pattern in feature space, thus (ii) harder to learn by model without
a suitable assumption, and finally, leads to (iii) high variance between
different learners. In light of these findings, we propose to (i) distill the
knowledge of the source UAD model to an imitation learner (booster) that holds
no data assumption, then (ii) exploit the variance between them to perform
automatic correction, and thus (iii) improve the booster over the original UAD
model. We use a neural network as the booster for its strong expressive power
as a universal approximator and ability to perform flexible post-hoc tuning.
Note that UADB is a model-agnostic framework that can enhance heterogeneous UAD

representation learning to improve the performance and sample efficiency of
vision-based reinforcement learning algorithms in single-agent settings.
However, in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), these techniques face
challenges because each agent only receives partial observation from an
environment influenced by others, resulting in correlated observations in the
agent dimension. So it is necessary to consider agent-level information in
representation learning for MARL. In this paper, we propose an effective
framework called \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}asked
\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{L}earning (MA2CL), which
encourages learning representation to be both temporal and agent-level
predictive by reconstructing the masked agent observation in latent space.
Specifically, we use an attention reconstruction model for recovering and the
model is trained via contrastive learning. MA2CL allows better utilization of
contextual information at the agent level, facilitating the training of MARL
agents for cooperation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the performance and sample efficiency of different MARL
algorithms and outperforms other methods in various vision-based and
state-based scenarios. Our code can be found in

important ingredient in our understanding of the magnetism of low mass stars.
Their spatial distribution connects the field generated in the stellar interior
with the outer corona and the large scale field, and thereby affects the space
weather of planets. Unfortunately, we lack techniques that can locate them on
most low-mass stars. One strategy is to localize field concentrations using the
flares that occur in their vicinity.
  We explore a new method that adapts the spot simulation software fleck to
study the modulation of flaring times as a function of active latitude. We use
empirical relations to construct flare light curves similar to those available
from Kepler and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), search them
for flares, and use the waiting times between flares to determine the location
of active latitudes.
  We find that the mean and standard deviation of the waiting time distribution
provide a unique diagnostic of flaring latitudes as a function of the number of
active regions. Latitudes are best recovered when stars have three or less
active regions that flare repeatedly, and active latitude widths below 20 deg;
when either increases, the information about the active latitude location is
gradually lost. We demonstrate our technique on a sample of flaring G dwarfs
observed with the Kepler satellite, and furthermore suggest that combining
ensemble methods for spots and flares could overcome the limitations of each
individual technique for the localization of surface magnetic fields.

diffusion (Dslow) of the spleen are much underestimated is likely due to the
MRI properties of the spleen such as the much longer T2 relaxation time. It is
possible that longer T2 relaxation time partially mitigates the signal decay
effect of various gradients on diffusion weighted image. This phenomenon will
not be limited to the spleen. Most liver tumors have a longer T2 relaxation
time than their native normal tissue and this is considered to be associated
with oedema. On the other hand, most tumors are measured with lower MRI
diffusion (despite being oedematous). The reason why malignant tumors have
lower diffusion value [apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and Dslow] are
poorly understood but has been proposed to be related to a combination of
higher cellularity, tissue disorganization, and increased extracellular space
tortuosity. These explanations may be true, but it is also possible to that
many tumors have MRI properties similar to the spleen such as longer T2
(relative to the liver) and these MRI properties may also contribute to the
lower MRI measured ADC and Dslow . In other words, if we could hypothetically

For anabatic flows, these vortices have already been identified to exhibit an
unique topology that bears a striking resemblance to speaker-wires since they
stay coherent as a single unit without the presence of another vortex pair.
Under katabatic conditions and at a constant Prandtl number, we find that the
longitudinal vortices emerging at a range of different slope angles possess the
similar topology as their anabatic counterparts. We determine the existence of
both fundamental and subharmonic secondary instabilities depending on the slope
angle for the most likely transverse base flow wavelength. Our results indicate
that the most dominant instability shifts from a fundamental to subharmonic

responsible for the bending and movement of single or multiple speaker-wire

forms of natural distribution shift, i.e., (i) context shift, (ii) viewpoint

out-of-distribution benchmark pairs using available public datasets and a
series of evaluation protocols to stress-test the different methods under the
intended shifts. Our study uncovers a series of intriguing findings and
interesting behaviors of VSSL methods. For instance, we observe that while
video models generally struggle with context shifts, v-MAE and supervised
learning exhibit more robustness. Moreover, our study shows that v-MAE is a

separation between the internal and external dimensions: the negative external
conformal contribution must be sub-dominant to the positive internal
contribution. We then focus specifically on the families of solutions of
eleven-dimensional supergravity on AdS$_4 \times S^7$ and AdS$_7 \times S^4$.
For these, there is only a single further additional contribution to the action
metric coming from variations of the Freund-Rubin flux. This contribution is
subtle to implement, and the unique prescription we find requires singling out
the radial direction of AdS as special. Adding the flux contribution yields an
overall total action metric which becomes positive for both the AdS$_4$ and
AdS$_7$ families of solutions. The final result is therefore a procedure which
yields a well-defined distance for these families of solutions.

to its great significance in real-world applications. Although the existing
CISS methods demonstrate remarkable performance, they either leverage the
high-level knowledge (feature) only while neglecting the rich and diverse
knowledge in the low-level features, leading to poor old knowledge preservation
and weak new knowledge exploration; or use multi-level features for knowledge
distillation by retraining a heavy backbone, which is computationally
intensive. In this paper, we for the first time propose to efficiently reuse
the multi-grained knowledge for CISS by fusing multi-level features with the
frozen backbone and show a simple aggregation of varying-level features, i.e.,
naive feature pyramid, can boost the performance significantly. We further
introduce a novel densely-interactive feature pyramid (DEFY) module that
enhances the fusion of high- and low-level features by enabling their dense
interaction. Specifically, DEFY establishes a per-pixel relationship between
pairs of feature maps, allowing for multi-pair outputs to be aggregated. This
results in improved semantic segmentation by leveraging the complementary
information from multi-level features. We show that DEFY can be effortlessly
integrated into three representative methods for performance enhancement. Our
method yields a new state-of-the-art performance when combined with the current
SOTA by notably averaged mIoU gains on two widely used benchmarks, i.e., 2.5%
on PASCAL VOC 2012 and 2.3% on ADE20K.

extensive and costly real-world training data. In this paper, we propose a

data harvesting mission with limited knowledge about the environment,
significantly reducing the real-world training data demand. The proposed
algorithm alternates between learning an environment model from real-world
measurements and federated QMIX training in the simulated environment.
Specifically, collected measurements from the real-world environment are used
to learn the radio channel and estimate unknown IoT device locations to create
a simulated environment. Each UAV agent trains a local QMIX model in its
simulated environment and continuously consolidates it through federated
learning with other agents, accelerating the learning process and further
improving training sample efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that our
proposed model-aided FedQMIX algorithm substantially reduces the need for
real-world training experiences while attaining similar data collection
performance as standard MARL algorithms.

show that diversity is critical in sampling outliers for OOD detection

multiple access (CD-NOMA) techniques are one of the potential candidates to
address the next-generation wireless needs such as massive connectivity, and
high reliability. This work focuses on two primary CD-NOMA techniques:
sparse-code multiple access (SCMA) and dense-code multiple access (DCMA). One
of the primary challenges in implementing MIMO-CD-NOMA systems is designing the
optimal detector with affordable computation cost and complexity. This paper
proposes an iterative linear detector based on the alternating direction method
of multipliers (ADMM). First, the maximum likelihood (ML) detection problem is
converted into a sharing optimization problem. The set constraint in the ML
detection problem is relaxed into the box constraint sharing problem. An
alternative variable is introduced via the penalty term, which compensates for
the loss incurred by the constraint relaxation. The system models, i.e., the
relation between the input signal and the received signal, are reformulated so
that the proposed sharing optimization problem can be readily applied.
  The ADMM is a robust algorithm to solve the sharing problem in a distributed
manner. The proposed detector leverages the distributive nature to reduce
per-iteration cost and time. An ADMM-based linear detector is designed for
three MIMO-CD-NOMA systems: single input multi output CD-NOMA (SIMO-CD-NOMA),
spatial multiplexing CD-NOMA (SMX-CD-NOMA), and spatial modulated CD-NOMA
(SM-CD-NOMA). The impact of various system parameters and ADMM parameters on
computational complexity and symbol error rate (SER) has been thoroughly
examined through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

continual FL with intermediate controllers, i.e., icP2P-FL. Specifically,
different from the conventional FL model, the proposed icP2P-FL does not
require a central server that coordinates training information for a global
model. In the proposed icP2P-FL method, the peer-to-peer federated continual
learning is introduced wherein the DL-based model is continually trained one
client after another via model transferring and inter institutional parameter
sharing due to the common characteristics of CT data among the clients.
Furthermore, an intermediate controller is developed to make the overall
training more flexible. Numerous experiments were conducted on the AAPM
low-dose CT Grand Challenge dataset and local datasets, and the experimental
results showed that the proposed icP2P-FL method outperforms the other

overcome the aforementioned barriers that DSIC mechanisms face in both the

represents a promising platform for exploring the layer-dependent magnetism and
topological states of matter. Despite the realization of several quantized
phenomena, such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and the axion insulator
state, the recently observed discrepancies between magnetic and transport
properties have aroused controversies concerning the topological nature of
MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ in the ground state. Here, we demonstrate the existence of two
distinct types of zero Hall phenomena in few-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. In addition
to the robust zero Hall plateau associated with the axion insulator state, an
unexpected zero Hall phenomenon also occurs in some odd-number-septuple layer
devices. Importantly, a statistical survey of the optical contrast in more than
200 MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ reveals that such accidental zero Hall phenomenon arises
from the reduction of effective thickness during fabrication process, a factor
that was rarely noticed in previous studies of 2D materials. Our finding not
only resolves the controversies on the relation between magnetism and anomalous
Hall effect in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, but also highlights the critical issues
concerning the fabrication and characterization of devices based on 2D

indexed by a physical parameter $m$, which characterizes the constitutive
relation between density and pressure. Based on these models, we employ the
Bayesian inversion framework to infer parametric and nonparametric unknowns
that affect tumor growth from noisy observations of tumor cell density. We
establish the well-posedness and the stability theories for the Bayesian
inversion problem and further prove the convergence of the posterior
distribution in the so-called incompressible limit, $m \rightarrow \infty$.
Since the posterior distribution across the index regime $m\in[2,\infty)$ can
thus be treated in a unified manner, such theoretical results also guide the
design of the numerical inference for the unknown. We propose a generic
computational framework for such inverse problems, which consists of a typical

a balanced feature distribution, we introduce category-wise variation into the
network predictions in the training phase such that an instance is no longer

is highly dependent on the category scale, which appears as assigning smaller
variation to head classes and larger variation to tail classes. In this way, we
manage to close the gap between the feature areas of different categories,
resulting in a more balanced representation. It is noteworthy that the
introduced variation is discarded at the inference stage to facilitate a

remains unclear whether ODE-based probability flow or SDE-based diffusion

challenging due to dependencies on data distribution, score training, and other
numerical factors. In this paper, we examine the problem mathematically by
examining two limiting scenarios: the ODE case and the large diffusion case. We
first introduce a pulse-shape error to perturb the score function and analyze
error accumulation, with a generalization to arbitrary error. Our findings
indicate that when the perturbation occurs at the end of the generative
process, the ODE model outperforms the SDE model (with a large diffusion
coefficient). However, when the perturbation occurs earlier, the SDE model
outperforms the ODE model, and we demonstrate that the error of sample
generation due to pulse-shape error can be exponentially suppressed as the
diffusion term's magnitude increases to infinity. Numerical validation of this
phenomenon is provided using toy models such as Gaussian, Gaussian mixture
models, and Swiss roll. Finally, we experiment with MNIST and observe that
varying the diffusion coefficient can improve sample quality even when the

one-dimensional non-isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with shock data. The
limiting problem was solved in 1989 by Hoff-Liu in [13] for isentropic gas with
single shock, but was left open for non-isentropic case. In this paper, we
solve the non-isentropic case, i.e., we first establish the global existence of
solutions to the non-isentropic Navier-Stokes equations with initial
discontinuous shock data, and then show these solutions converge in
$L^{\infty}$ norm to a single shock wave of the corresponding Euler equations
away from the shock curve in any finite time interval, as both the viscosity
and heat-conductivity tend to zero.
  Different from [13] in which an integrated system was essentially used,
motivated by [21,22], we introduce a time-dependent shift
$\mathbf{X}^\varepsilon(t)$ to the viscous shock so that a weighted
Poincar\'{e} inequality can be applied to overcome the difficulty generated
from the ``bad"" sign of the derivative of viscous shock velocity, and the
anti-derivative technique is not needed. We also obtain an intrinsic property
of non-isentropic viscous shock, see Lemma 2.2 below. With the help of Lemma
2.2, we can derive the desired uniform a priori estimates of solutions, which
can be shown to converge in $L^{\infty}$ norm to a single inviscid shock in any
given finite time interval away from the shock, as the vanishing dissipation
limit. Moreover, the shift $\mathbf{X}^\varepsilon(t)$ tends to zero in any
finite time as viscosity tends to zero. The proof consists of a scaling
argument, $L^2$-contraction technique with time-dependent shift to the shock,

quantify the incremental gain, to some relevant pre-defined utility, of
aggregating an individual dataset to others. As seminal examples, dataset
valuation has been leveraged in collaborative and federated learning to create
incentives for data sharing across several data owners. The Shapley value has
recently been proposed as a principled tool to achieve this goal due to formal
axiomatic justification. Since its computation often requires exponential time,
standard approximation strategies based on Monte Carlo integration have been
considered. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in
some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the
dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We
propose a novel approximation of the Shapley value, referred to as discrete
uniform Shapley (DU-Shapley) which is expressed as an expectation under a
discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the
relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic
theoretical guarantees and show that DU-Shapley tends towards the Shapley value
when the number of data owners is large. The benefits of the proposed framework
are finally illustrated on several dataset valuation benchmarks. DU-Shapley
outperforms other Shapley value approximations, even when the number of data
owners is small.

computationally expensive and often yields poor visual fidelity. In this paper,
we propose DreamPortrait, which aims to generate text-guided 3D-aware portraits

Distillation Sampling from datapoint to distribution formulation, which injects
semantic prior into a 3D distribution. However, the direct extension will lead
to the mode collapse problem since the objective only pursues semantic
alignment. Hence, we propose to optimize a distribution with hierarchical
condition adapters and GAN loss regularization. For better 3D modeling, we
further design a 3D-aware gated cross-attention mechanism to explicitly let the
model perceive the correspondence between the text and the 3D-aware space.
These elaborated designs enable our model to generate portraits with robust

rays at TeV to PeV energies. The decays of heavy dark matter particles in the

The main background for the LHAASO's CR electron measurements is the hadron
residuals due to mis-identification of the particle species. In this paper, we
estimate the LHAASO's electron background using the known all-particle CR
spectrum and the hadron rejection efficiency of LHAASO. With the estimated
background, we predict the capability of LHAASO to constrain DM decay lifetime
at 95% confidence level for various channels. We find that, if neglecting
systematic uncertainties, the CR electron measurement by LHAASO can improve the
current best results by up to on order of magnitude for DM masses between 100 -
1000TeV. However, indirect measurements of CR electrons by ground-based
experiments suffer from uncertainties included in the calculation, the
projected constraints will be largely weakened. So for using the CR electron
observation of LHAASO to constrain the DM parameters, the key point is whether
the systematic error can be effectively reduced.

  revealed by machine-learning molecular dynamics simulations","12 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a family of materials that have high
porosity and structural tunability and hold great potential in various
applications, many of which requiring a proper understanding of the thermal
transport properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important
role in characterizing the thermal transport properties of various materials.
However, due to the complexity of the structures, it is difficult to construct
accurate empirical interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulations of MOFs.
To this end, we develop a set of accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned
potentials for three typical MOFs, including MOF-5, HKUST-1, and ZIF-8, using
the neuroevolution potential approach as implemented in the GPUMD package, and
perform extensive MD simulations to study thermal transport in the three MOFs.
Although the lattice thermal conductivity (LTC) values of the three MOFs are
all predicted to be smaller than 1 $\rm{W/(m\ K)}$ at room temperature, the
phonon mean free paths (MFPs) are found to reach the sub-micrometer scale in
the low-frequency region. As a consequence, the apparent LTC only converges to
the diffusive limit for micrometer single crystals, which means that the LTC is
heavily reduced in nanocrystalline MOFs. The sub-micrometer phonon MFPs are
also found to be correlated with a moderate temperature dependence of LTC
between those in typical crystalline and amorphous materials. Both the large
phonon MFPs and the moderate temperature dependence of LTC fundamentally change
our understanding of thermal transport in MOFs.

  Retrieval","11 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Language-guided image retrieval enables users to search for images and
interact with the retrieval system more naturally and expressively by using a
reference image and a relative caption as a query. Most existing studies mainly
focus on designing image-text composition architecture to extract
discriminative visual-linguistic relations. Despite great success, we identify
an inherent problem that obstructs the extraction of discriminative features
and considerably compromises model training: \textbf{triplet ambiguity}. This
problem stems from the annotation process wherein annotators view only one
triplet at a time. As a result, they often describe simple attributes, such as
color, while neglecting fine-grained details like location and style. This
leads to multiple false-negative candidates matching the same modification
text. We propose a novel Consensus Network (Css-Net) that self-adaptively
learns from noisy triplets to minimize the negative effects of triplet
ambiguity. Inspired by the psychological finding that groups perform better
than individuals, Css-Net comprises 1) a consensus module featuring four
distinct compositors that generate diverse fused image-text embeddings and 2) a
Kullback-Leibler divergence loss, which fosters learning among the compositors,
enabling them to reduce biases learned from noisy triplets and reach a
consensus. The decisions from four compositors are weighted during evaluation
to further achieve consensus. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets
demonstrate that Css-Net can alleviate triplet ambiguity, achieving competitive
performance on benchmarks, such as $+2.77\%$ R@10 and $+6.67\%$ R@50 on
FashionIQ.

its practice is discussed. Despite involving AI, in the form of ChatGPT, the
assessment adheres to the convention of posing questions invoking critical
thinking and problem solving skills. However, AI is characteristically
integrated in this assessment by instructing the learners to employ ChatGPT as
one of the primary sources. The learners are directed to report the use of
ChatGPT by including both the prompts and its responses, before expressing
their thoughts on AI-generated answers and their own concluding statement.
These three characteristic components of the present techniques -- the handling
of ChatGPT through the prompts, comments on the AI-responses and the concluding
thoughts -- are evaluated to gauge the learning.
  The proposed assessment was assigned as a take-home group activity for a
batch of seventy eight students, divided into thirteen groups. Despite
addressing the same questions, there was no significant overlap in the answers.
Moreover, a wide range of approaches were adopted by the groups in handling
ChatGPT, which in-turn rendered different responses, ultimately drawing
distinct answers. Besides preventing the undesired use of ChatGPT by explicitly
integrating it, the proposed assessment seemingly helped the learners question
the accuracy of its responses. This self-realised skepticism can be expected to
curtail blatant malpractices involving ChatGPT in the long run.

a novel interpretation of microbial data as attractors, or more precisely as

the latent space induced by TimeX. TimeX provides discrete attribution maps
and, unlike existing interpretability methods, it learns a latent space of

  Quy Tran","Simulating Noisy Quantum Circuits for Cryptographic Algorithms",,,,,"cs.CR quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emergence of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has
important consequences for cryptographic algorithms. It is theoretically
well-established that key algorithms used in cybersecurity are vulnerable to
quantum computers due to the fact that theoretical security guarantees,
designed based on algorithmic complexity for classical computers, are not
sufficient for quantum circuits. Many different quantum algorithms have been
developed, which have potentially broad applications on future computing
systems. However, this potential depends on the continued maturation of quantum
hardware, which remains an area of active research and development. Theoretical
limits provide an upper bound on the performance for algorithms. In practice,
threats to encryption can only be accurately be assessed in the context of the
rapidly evolving hardware and software landscape. Software co-design refers to
the concurrent design of software and hardware as a way to understand the
limitations of current capabilities and develop effective strategies to advance
the state of the art. Since the capabilities for classical computation
currently exceed quantum capabilities, quantum emulation techniques can play an
important role in the co-design process. In this paper, we describe how the
{\em cuQuantum} environment can support quantum algorithm co-design activities
using widely-available commodity hardware. We describe how emulation techniques
can be used to assess the impact of noise on algorithms of interest, and
identify limitations associated with current hardware. We present our analysis
in the context of areas of priority for cybersecurity and cryptography in
particular since these algorithms are extraordinarily consequential for
securing information in the digital world.

between the classical force calculation and the quantum topological theory, the
direction of the predicted deflection is opposite. Here we point out the simple

efforts and activities must be coordinated or regulated. Not readily observable
and measurable, this particular aspect often goes unnoticed and understudied in
complex systems. Diving into the Wikipedia ecosystem, where people are free to
join and voluntarily edit individual pages with no firm rules, we identified
and quantified three fundamental coordination mechanisms and found they scale
with an influx of contributors in a remarkably systemic way over three order of
magnitudes. Firstly, we have found a super-linear growth in mutual adjustments
(scaling exponent: 1.3), manifested through extensive discussions and activity
reversals. Secondly, the increase in direct supervision (scaling exponent:
0.9), as represented by the administrators' activities, is disproportionately
limited. Finally, the rate of rule enforcement exhibits the slowest escalation
(scaling exponent 0.7), reflected by automated bots. The observed scaling
exponents are notably robust across topical categories with minor variations
attributed to the topic complication. Our findings suggest that as more people
contribute to a project, a self-regulating ecosystem incurs faster mutual
adjustments than direct supervision and rule enforcement. These findings have
practical implications for online collaborative communities aiming to enhance
their coordination efficiency. These results also have implications for how we
understand human organizations in general.

17/RX J0440.9+4431 at two luminosity levels during the giant outburst in
January--February 2023. Considering the observed spectral variability and
changes in the pulse profiles, the source was likely caught in super- and
sub-critical states with significantly different emission region geometry,
associated with the presence of accretion columns and hot spots, respectively.
We focus here on the pulse-phase resolved polarimetric analysis and find that
the observed dependencies of the polarization degree and polarization angle
(PA) on pulse phase are indeed drastically different for the two observations.
The observed differences, if interpreted within the framework of the rotating
vector model (RVM), imply dramatic variations of the spin axis inclination and
the position angle and the magnetic colatitude by tens of degrees within just a
few days separating the observations. We suggest that the apparent changes in
the observed PA phase dependence are predominantly related to the presence of a
polarized unpulsed component in addition to the polarized radiation associated
with the pulsar itself. We show that the observed PA phase dependence in both
observations can then be explained with a single set of RVM parameters defining
the pulsar's geometry. We also suggest that the additional polarized component
is likely produced by scattering of the pulsar radiation off the equatorial
disk wind.

contrastive learning, it remains unclear whether GCL inherits the same
oversmoothing defect from GNNs. This work undertakes a fundamental analysis of
GCL from the perspective of oversmoothing on the first hand. We demonstrate
empirically that increasing network depth in GCL also leads to oversmoothing in
their deep representations, and surprisingly, the shallow ones. We refer to
this phenomenon in GCL as long-range starvation', wherein lower layers in deep
networks suffer from degradation due to the lack of sufficient guidance from
supervision (e.g., loss computing). Based on our findings, we present BlockGCL,
a remarkably simple yet effective blockwise training framework to prevent GCL
from notorious oversmoothing. Without bells and whistles, BlockGCL consistently
improves robustness and stability for well-established GCL methods with
increasing numbers of layers on real-world graph benchmarks. We believe our
work will provide insights for future improvements of scalable and deep GCL
frameworks.

strength of the spin-one field present in the massless gravitational multiplet
in the theory of closed bosonic strings (compactified to four dimensions).
Microscopic models for the emergence of such backgrounds are provided both by
low-energy string-inspired gravitational theories with torsion (including
(primordial) gravitational and axial gauge anomalies) and by Einstein-Cartan
gravity, a closely related simpler model. In this work we examine the
pseudoscalar quanta of the KR axion in this background using the methods of
effective field theory. In our model for leptogenesis there is a single sterile
{right-handed} neutrino (RHN) with mass $m_N$. At energies lower than $m_N$, an
axion potential is derived by integrating out {at one loop} the sterile
neutrino in the spirit of effective field theory. The stability of this axion
potential is important for the viability of our model. The vacuum of this
potential is generally metastable. The stability of the vacuum is determined by
the ratio of the torsion-induced-axion coupling (which depends on the string
mass scale) to $m_N$, which should be larger or equal to one, for the validity
of our effective field theory. The vacuum is metastable only for axion
couplings much larger than the sterile neutrino mass (large string mass scales,
e.g. comparable to the four-dimensional Planck mass), with a lifetime much
larger than the age of the observable Universe. By contrast, if axion couplings
are comparable to the RHN mass the false vacuum is highly unstable, with a
lifetime much smaller than the age of the observable Universe; in this case the

exchange bias is along the in-plane easy axis of CrSBr, perpendicular to the
out-of-plane anisotropy of the FGT, inducing a strongly tilted magnetic
configuration in the FGT. Furthermore, the in-plane exchange bias provides
sufficient symmetry breaking to allow deterministic spin-orbit torque switching
of the FGT in CrSBr/FGT/Pt samples at zero applied magnetic field. A minimum
thickness of the CrSBr greater than 10 nm is needed to provide a non-zero
exchange bias at 30 K.

methods, specifically fine-tuned large language models, for pre-annotating data
for a lexical extension task, namely adding descriptive words (verbs) to an
existing (but incomplete, as of yet) ontology of event types. Several research
questions have been focused on, from the investigation of a possible heuristics
to provide at least hints to annotators which verbs to include and which are
outside the current version of the ontology, to the possible use of the
automatic scores to help the annotators to be more efficient in finding a
threshold for identifying verbs that cannot be assigned to any existing class
and therefore they are to be used as seeds for a new class. We have also
carefully examined the correlation of the automatic scores with the human
annotation. While the correlation turned out to be strong, its influence on the
annotation proper is modest due to its near linearity, even though the mere
fact of such pre-annotation leads to relatively short annotation times.

and the coupling coefficients may also involve negative ones due to some
circumstances. This paper introduces these phenomena into a class of

been employed to overcome the difficulty of analysis on the introduced

for containing the effects caused by the unknown direction, and to analyze the
non-convexity by admitting the negative coupling coefficients in a certain
range. Under the actions of these phenomena, the constructed polytopes are
shown to be invariant in view of the contractive set method. It means that the
convergence of formation shape can be guaranteed. Subsequently, an example is

theoretical solutions for the conditions of cooperation success and the
cooperation level under weak selection, scanning the complete parameter space.
When the weight factors are equally strong, the promoting effect of
self-interaction to cooperation surpasses the inhibitory effect of updating
passivity. Intriguingly, however, we identify non-monotonous
cooperation-supporting effects when the weight of updating passivity increases
more rapidly. Our findings are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations and

incapable of handling handle missing modalities in real-life scenarios.
Motivated by the intuition that rumors in social media are more likely to have

proposed to detect rumors with multimedia contents. It uses two consistency
detection subnetworks to capture the inconsistency at the cross-modal level and
the content-knowledge level simultaneously. It also enables robust multi-modal

expanded on a random walker graph by using novel mechanisms to derive the edge

implicit and explicit edge detection to enhance detection of weak boundaries
between different classes in spatial domain. The implicit edge detection relied
on the outlier detection capability of the Tukey's function and the
classification reliabilities of the samples estimated by a hierarchical random

that pure $R^2$ theory propagates $\textit{massless}$ spin-2 graviton on a de
Sitter (dS) background but $\textit{not}$ on a locally flat background. We
build on this insight to derive a Newtonian limit for the theory. Unlike most
previous works that linearized the metric around a locally flat background, we
explicitly employ the dS background to start with. We directly solve the field
equation of the action $(2\kappa)^{-1}\int d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\,R^2$ coupled with
the stress-energy tensor of normal matter in the form
$T_{\mu\nu}=Mc^2\,\delta(\vec{r})\,\delta_\mu^0\,\delta_\nu^0$. We obtain the
following Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric
$ds^{2}=-\Bigl(1-\frac{\Lambda}{3}r^{2}-\frac{\kappa
c^{2}}{48\pi\Lambda}\frac{M}{r}\Bigr)c^2dt^2+\Bigl(1-\frac{\Lambda}{3}r^2-\frac{\kappa
c^2}{48\pi\Lambda}\frac{M}{r}\Bigr)^{-1}dr^2+r^2d\Omega^2$ which features a
potential $V(r)=-\frac{\kappa c^4}{96\pi\Lambda}\frac{M}{r}$ with the correct
Newtonian tail. The parameter $\Lambda$ plays a dual role: (i) it sets the
scalar curvature for the background dS metric, and (ii) it partakes in the
Newtonian potential $V(r)$. We reach two key findings. Firstly, the Newtonian
limit only emerges owing to the de Sitter background. Most existing studies of
the Newtonian limit in modified gravity chose to linearize the metric around a
locally flat background. However, this is a $\textit{false}$ vacuum to start
with for pure $R^2$ gravity. These studies unknowingly omitted the information
about $\Lambda$ of the de Sitter background, hence incapable of attaining a
Newtonian behavior in pure $R^2$ gravity. Secondly, as $\Lambda$ appears in
$V(r)$ in a $\textit{singular}$ manner, viz. $V(r)\propto\Lambda^{-1}$, the
Newtonian limit for pure $R^2$ gravity cannot be obtained by any perturbative
approach treating $\Lambda$ as a small parameter.

e.g., Functional Connectivity (FC) and Structural Connectivity (SC), from
multi-modal imaging techniques can take their complementary information into
account and therefore have the potential to get better decoding capability.
However, traditional approaches for integrating FC and SC overlook the
dynamical variations, which stand a great chance to over-generalize the brain
neural network. In this paper, we propose a Joint kernel Graph Attention
Network (JGAT), which is a new multi-modal temporal graph attention network
framework. It integrates the data from functional Magnetic Resonance Images
(fMRI) and Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) while preserving the dynamic
information at the same time. We conduct brain-decoding tasks with our JGAT on
four independent datasets: three of 7T fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome
Project (HCP) and one from animal neural recordings. Furthermore, with
Attention Scores (AS) and Frame Scores (FS) computed and learned from the
model, we can locate several informative temporal segments and build meaningful
dynamical pathways along the temporal domain for the HCP datasets. The URL to

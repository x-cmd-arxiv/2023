back-reaction from a quantum field onto the dynamics of a moving mirror. We
describe the coupling between the mirror and the field by using a microscopic
model from which the dielectric response of the mirror is obtained from first
principles. Using second-order perturbation theory, we derive the master
equation governing the mechanical motion of the mirror. Our analysis reveals
that the mirror experiences coloured noise and non-local dissipation, which
originate from the emission of particle pairs via the dynamical Casimir effect.
We show that the noise and dissipation kernels, that enter in the definition of
the time-dependent coefficients of the master equation, are related by
fluctuation-dissipation relations.

visibility domains. In this line we provide a general visibility criteria for a

Uniform domains, John domains and domains satisfying quasihyperbolic boundary

approach exploits a parametrization of the regression function that is tailored
toward estimating a low-dimensional parameter of interest. The key property of
the parametrization is that it generates a Neyman orthogonal moment condition
meaning that the low-dimensional parameter is less sensitive to the estimation
of nuisance parameters. Our large sample analysis supports this claim. In
particular, we derive sufficient conditions under which the posterior for the
low-dimensional parameter contracts around the truth at the parametric rate and
is asymptotically normal with a variance that coincides with the semiparametric
efficiency bound. These conditions allow for a larger class of nuisance
parameters relative to the original parametrization of the regression model.
Overall, we conclude that a parametrization that embeds Neyman orthogonality
can be a useful device for debiasing posterior distributions in semiparametric
models.

is possible, as 0.4% of the 250k users we simulate are re-identified. These

are uniquely re-identified after 15 weeks of browsing, increasing to 75% after

also find that advertisers and publishers can abuse the Topics API to
potentially assign unique identifiers to users, defeating the desired privacy

the observed signals from the current detector network have already been
carried out, though there have as yet been no confident detections. However,
predictions of the observation rate of lensing suggest detection in the future
is a realistic possibility. Therefore, preparations need to be made to
thoroughly investigate the candidate lensed signals. In this work, we present
some of the follow-up analyses and strategies that could be applied to assess
the significance of such events and ascertain what information may be extracted
about the lens-source system from such candidate signals by applying them to a
number of O3 candidate events, even if these signals did not yield a high
significance for any of the lensing hypotheses. For strongly-lensed candidates,
we verify their significance using a background of simulated unlensed events
and statistics computed from lensing catalogs. We also look for potential
electromagnetic counterparts. In addition, we analyse in detail a candidate for
a strongly-lensed sub-threshold counterpart that is identified by a new method.
For microlensing candidates, we perform model selection using a number of lens
models to investigate our ability to determine the mass density profile of the
lens and constrain the lens parameters. We also look for millilensing
signatures in one of the lensed candidates. Applying these additional analyses
does not lead to any additional evidence for lensing in the candidates that
have been examined. However, it does provide important insight into potential
avenues to deal with high-significance candidates in future observations.

framework and accounts for non-causal effects generated by the presence of
observations. It is based on a graphical model representation of the epidemic
stochastic process and utilizes dynamic cavity equations to derive a set of
self-consistent equations for probability marginals defined on the edges of the
contact graph. By performing a small-coupling expansion, a pair of
time-dependent cavity messages is obtained, which capture the probability of
individual infection and the conditioning power of observations. In its
efficient formulation, the computational cost per iteration of the SCDC
algorithm is linear in the duration of the epidemic dynamics and in the number
of contacts. The SCDC method is derived for the Susceptible-Infected (SI) model
and straightforwardly applicable to other Markovian epidemic processes,
including recurrent ones. It exhibits high accuracy in assessing individual
risk on par with Belief Propagation techniques and outperforming heuristic
methods based on individual-based mean-field approximations. Although
convergence issues may arise due to long-range correlations in contact graphs,
the estimated marginal probabilities remain sufficiently accurate for reliable
risk estimation. Future work includes extending the method to non-Markovian
recurrent epidemic models and investigating the role of second-order terms in
the small coupling expansion of the observation-reweighted Dynamic Cavity

neural networks can learn low-dimensional features efficiently, and in
particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have shown promising results in
classifying Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data. A key factor in the success of
deep neural networks is this astonishing expressive power. However, this power
comes at the cost of complex, black-boxed models, conflicting with the goals of
building reliable and human-understandable models. An essential criterion in
understanding such predictive deep models involves quantifying the contribution
of time-varying input variables to the classification. Hence, in this work, we
introduce a new framework for interpreting multivariate time series data by
extracting and clustering the input representative patterns that highly
activate CNN neurons. This way, we identify each signal's role and
dependencies, considering all possible combinations of signals in the MTS
input. Then, we construct a graph that captures the temporal relationship
between the extracted patterns for each layer. An effective graph merging
strategy finds the connection of each node to the previous layer's nodes.
Finally, a graph embedding algorithm generates new representations of the
created interpretable time-series features. To evaluate the performance of our
proposed framework, we run extensive experiments on eight datasets of the
UCR/UEA archive, along with HAR and PAM datasets. The experiments indicate the
benefit of our time-aware graph-based representation in MTS classification

Thoracic echocardiography (TTE) can provide sufficient cardiac structure
information, evaluate hemodynamics and cardiac function, and is an effective
method for atrial septal defect (ASD) examination. This paper aims to study a
deep learning method based on cardiac ultrasound video to assist in ASD
diagnosis. Materials and methods: We select two standard views of the atrial
septum (subAS) and low parasternal four-compartment view (LPS4C) as the two
views to identify ASD. We enlist data from 300 children patients as part of a
double-blind experiment for five-fold cross-validation to verify the
performance of our model. In addition, data from 30 children patients (15
positives and 15 negatives) are collected for clinician testing and compared to
our model test results (these 30 samples do not participate in model training).
We propose an echocardiography video-based atrial septal defect diagnosis
system. In our model, we present a block random selection, maximal agreement
decision and frame sampling strategy for training and testing respectively,
resNet18 and r3D networks are used to extract the frame features and aggregate
them to build a rich video-level representation. Results: We validate our model
using our private dataset by five-cross validation. For ASD detection, we
achieve 89.33 AUC, 84.95 accuracy, 85.70 sensitivity, 81.51 specificity and
81.99 F1 score. Conclusion: The proposed model is multiple instances
learning-based deep learning model for video atrial septal defect detection
which effectively improves ASD detection accuracy when compared to the
performances of previous networks and clinical doctors.

dissipation when learning operators in spherical coordinates since they
incorrectly assume a flat geometry. To overcome this limitation, we generalize
FNOs on the sphere, introducing Spherical FNOs (SFNOs) for learning operators
on spherical geometries. We apply SFNOs to forecasting atmospheric dynamics,

Furthermore, the additive impulsive noise at each node is modeled by an

the early screening and management of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). In
practice, it is common to see multiple co-occurring cardiac disorders, i.e.,
multi-label or multimorbidity in patients with CVDs, which increases the risk
for mortality. Most current research focuses on the single-label ECG
classification, i.e., each ECG record corresponds to one cardiac disorder,
ignoring ECG records with multi-label phenomenon. In this paper, we propose an
ensemble of attention-based temporal convolutional neural network (ATCNN)
models for the multi-label classification of 12-lead ECG records. Specifically,
a set of ATCNN-based single-lead binary classifiers are trained one for each
cardiac disorder, and the predictions from these classifiers with simple
thresholding generate the final multi-label decisions. The ATCNN contains a
stack of TCNN layers followed by temporal and spatial attention layers. The
TCNN layers operate at different dilation rates to represent the multi-scaled
pathological ECG features dynamics, and attention layers emphasize/reduce the
diagnostically relevant/redundant 12-lead ECG information. The proposed
framework is evaluated on the PTBXL-2020 dataset and achieved an average
F1-score of 76.51%. Moreover, the spatial and temporal attention weights
visualization provides the optimal ECG-lead subset selection for each disease

task and without explicitly optimizing reconstruction. The learned
representation is optimized by a blind auxiliary agent trained to navigate with
it on multiple short sub episodes branching out from a waypoint and, most
importantly, without any direct visual observation. We argue and show that the
blindness property is important and forces the (trained) latent representation
to be the only means for planning. With probing experiments we show that the
learned representation optimizes navigability and not reconstruction. On
downstream tasks we show that it is robust to changes in distribution, in
particular the sim2real gap, which we evaluate with a real physical robot in a
real office building, significantly improving performance.

used to induce a multitude of unique phenomena, the uncharged nature of photons
necessitates alternative approaches to bring about similar control over photons

two-dimensional photonic crystals through engineered strain of the lattice.
Analogous to strained graphene, this induces flat-band Landau levels at
discrete energies. We study the spatial and spectral properties of these states
in silicon photonic crystals at telecom wavelengths with far-field
spectroscopy. Moreover, taking advantage of the photonic crystal's design
freedom, we realize domains of opposite pseudomagnetic field and observe
topological edge states at their interface. We reveal that the strain-induced
states can achieve remarkably high quality factors despite being phase-matched
to the radiation continuum. Together with the high density of states and high
degeneracy associated with flat bands, this provides powerful prospects for
enhancing light-matter interactions, and demonstrates a design principle to
govern both on-chip and radiating light fields.

orbiting within its surrounding debris disk. Estimating the size of this

via sublimation from the surface of the orbiting solid body. The sublimation
rate can be estimated as a simple function of the surface area of the solid

estimating the accretion rate requires detailed modeling of the surface

addition to heavy element sedimentation to accurately constrain the sublimation

several orders of magnitude higher than the $\dot M_{\rm acc}=5.6\times

accretion rate implies that the minimum estimated radius of the orbiting solid

assume that it is an ideal gas with a constant equation of state parameter,
while for the scalar field potential and the coupling function of the chameleon
mechanism we consider four different sets which provide four different models.
We consider the $H$-normalization approach and we write the field equations
with the help of dimensionless variables. The asymptotic solutions are
determined from where we find that the theory can describe the main eras of
cosmological history and evolution. Future attractors which describe
acceleration exist, however we found past acceleration solutions related to the
inflationary era, as also the radiation epoch and the matter dominated eras are
provided by the dynamics. We conclude that the Chameleon dark energy model can
be used as a unified model for the elements which contribute to the dark sector
of the universe.

combines high-frequency mechanical resonances and optically broadband phase

the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and
may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network
architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with
the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system
uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder
class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve
scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction
method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses
the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more
trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.

  Perspective","107 pages, 39 figures, 2 tables, 380 references; invited review for
  Physics Reports",,,,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We review numerous arguments for primordial black holes (PBHs) based on
observational evidence from a variety of lensing, dynamical, accretion and
gravitational-wave effects. This represents a shift from the usual emphasis on
PBH constraints and provides what we term a positivist perspective.
Microlensing observations of stars and quasars suggest that PBHs of around
$1\,M_{\odot}$ could provide much of the dark matter in galactic halos, this
being allowed by the Large Magellanic Cloud observations if the PBHs have an
extended mass function. More generally, providing the mass and dark matter
fraction of the PBHs is large enough, the associated Poisson fluctuations could
generate the first bound objects at a much earlier epoch than in the standard
cosmological scenario. This simultaneously explains the recent detection of
high-redshift dwarf galaxies, puzzling correlations of the source-subtracted
infrared and X-ray cosmic backgrounds, the size and the mass-to-light ratios of
ultra-faint-dwarf galaxies, the dynamical heating of the Galactic disk, and the
binary coalescences observed by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA in a mass range not usually
associated with stellar remnants. Even if PBHs provide only a small fraction of
the dark matter, they could explain various other observational conundra, and
sufficiently large ones could seed the supermassive black holes in galactic
nuclei or even early galaxies themselves. We argue that PBHs would naturally
have formed around the electroweak, quantum chromodynamics and
electron-positron annihilation epochs, when the sound-speed inevitably dips.
This leads to an extended PBH mass function with a number of distinct bumps,
the most prominent one being at around $1\,M_{\odot}$, and this would allow
PBHs to explain much of the evidence in a unified way.

cosmic filaments that connect galaxy clusters. This gas is thought to
constitute an important part of the missing baryons in the Universe. In
addition to the thermal gas, cosmic filaments could contain a population of
relativistic particles and magnetic fields. A detection of magnetic fields in
filaments can constrain early magnetogenesis in the cosmos. So far, the
resulting diffuse synchrotron emission has only been indirectly detected. We
present our search for thermal and non-thermal diffuse emission from
inter-cluster regions of 106 paired galaxy clusters by stacking the
$0.6-2.3$~keV X-ray and 144~MHz radio data obtained with the eROSITA telescope
on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory and LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR), respectively. The stacked data do not show the presence of X-ray and
radio diffuse emission in the inter-cluster regions. This could be due to the
sensitivity of the data sets and/or the limited number of cluster pairs used in
this study. Assuming a constant radio emissivity in the filaments, we find that
the mean radio emissivity is not higher than $1.2\times10^{-44}\,{\rm erg \,
s^{-1} \, cm^{-3} \, Hz^{-1}}$. Under equipartition conditions, our upper limit
on the mean emissivity translates to an upper limit of $\sim75\,{\rm nG}$ for
the mean magnetic field strength in the filaments, depending on the spectral
index and the minimum energy cutoff. We discuss the constraint for the magnetic
field strength in the context of the models for the formation of magnetic
fields in cosmic filaments.

double-degenerate binaries in which the other WD exploded. The other two
objects have lower minimum velocities, $\gtrsim 600\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, and may
have formed through a different mechanism, such as pure deflagration of a WD in
a Type Iax supernova. The four fastest stars are hotter and smaller than the
previously known ""D$^6$ stars,"" with effective temperatures ranging from
$\sim$20,000 to $\sim$130,000 K and radii of $\sim 0.02-0.10\,R_{\odot}$. Three
of these have carbon-dominated atmospheres, and one has a helium-dominated
atmosphere. Two stars have RVs of $-1694$ and $-2285\rm \,km\,s^{-1}$ -- the
fastest systemic stellar RVs ever measured. Their inferred birth velocities,
$\sim 2200-2500\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, imply that both WDs in the progenitor binary
had masses $>1.0\,M_{\odot}$. The high observed velocities suggest that a
dominant fraction of the observed hypervelocity WD population comes from
double-degenerate binaries whose total mass significantly exceeds the
Chandrasekhar limit. However, the two nearest and faintest D$^6$ stars have the
lowest velocities and masses, suggesting that observational selection effects
favor rarer, higher-mass stars. A significant population of fainter low-mass

blazars monitored by the Steward Observatory between 2008 and 2018 in the

optical polarization, searching for differences between blazar types. We
observe that BL Lac objects are typically less polarized and less variable than
flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). Moreover, BL Lacs display a distribution
of their polarization angle typically oriented in a preferential direction,
contrary to the rather random distribution of FSRQs. For the latter blazar
type, as well as those sources showing a bright stellar emission, we take into
account the depolarizing effect introduced by the broad line region and the
host galaxy on the measured polarization degree. In this sample we also observe
that BL Lacs present an uncorrelated evolution of the flux and the
polarization. Contrary, FSRQs show a correlation before the depolarization
correction, that is lost however after considering this effect. In addition, we
study the behaviour of the polarization angle, searching for angle rotations in
its long-term evolution. We derive that the FSRQs studied here show rotations
more frequently than BL Lac objects by a factor $\sim$1.5. During these periods
we also observe a systematic decrease of the polarization fraction, as well as
a marginal flux increase, not significant however to connect rotations with
optical flares. We interpret these results within the extended shock-in-jet

impact of outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) on their host
galaxies is unclear. In part, this may be because electron densities of
outflowing gas are often underestimated: recent studies that use alternative
diagnostics have measured much higher densities than those from commonly used
techniques, and consequently find modest outflow masses and kinetic powers.
Furthermore, outflow ionisation mechanisms - which are often used to probe
acceleration mechanisms - are also uncertain. To address these issues, we have
analysed archival HST/STIS spectra of the inner regions (r<160pc) of the nearby
prototypical Seyfert galaxies NGC 1068 and NGC 4151, which show evidence of
warm-ionised outflows driven by the central AGN. We derive high electron
densities ($10^{3.6}$<$n_e$<$10^{4.8}$cm$^{-3}$) using the transauroral [OII]
and [SII] emission lines ratios for the first time with spatially-resolved
observations. Moreover, we find evidence that the gas along the radio axis in
NGC 1068 has a significant AGN-photoionised matter-bounded component, and there
is evidence for shock-ionisation and/or radiation-bounded AGN-photoionisation
along the radio axis in NGC 4151. We also note that the outflow extents are
similar to those of the radio structures, consistent with acceleration by
jet-induced shocks. Taken together, our investigation demonstrates the
diversity of physical and ionisation conditions in the narrow line regions of
Seyfert galaxies, and hence reinforces the need for robust diagnostics of

symmetry breaking driven by electronic correlations, in contrast to traditional
lattice-driven ferroelectricity, leads to the formation of electric dipoles.
Despite the potential application advantages arising from its electronic
nature, switchable electronic ferroelectricity remains exceedingly rare. Here,
we report the discovery of an electronic ratchet effect that manifests itself
as switchable electronic ferroelectricity in a layer-contrasting graphene-boron
nitride moir\'e heterostructure. Our engineered layer-asymmetric moir\'e
potential landscapes result in layer-polarized localized and itinerant
electronic subsystems. At particular fillings of the localized subsystem, we
find a ratcheting injection of itinerant carriers in a non-volatile manner,
leading to a highly unusual ferroelectric response. Strikingly, the remnant
polarization can be stabilized at multiple (quasi-continuous) states with
behavior markedly distinct from known ferroelectrics. Our experimental
observations, simulations, and theoretical analysis suggest that dipolar
excitons are the driving force and elementary ferroelectric units in our
system. This signifies a new type of electronic ferroelectricity where the
formation of dipolar excitons with aligned moments generates a macroscopic
polarization and leads to an electronically-driven ferroelectric response,
which we term excitonic ferroelectricity. Such new ferroelectrics, driven by
quantum objects like dipolar excitons, could pave the way to innovative quantum
analog memory and synaptic devices.

modest glitches induce biases on the black-hole parameters. On the other hand,
a joint inference approach fully sanitizes the reconstruction of both the

Davis (1998, SFD) map, was found to contain extragalactic large-scale structure
(LSS) imprints (Chiang & M\'enard 2019). Such contamination is inherent in maps
based on infrared emission, which pick up not only Galactic dust but also the
cosmic infrared background (CIB). When SFD is used for extinction correction,
over-correction occurs in a spatially correlated and redshift-dependent manner,
which could impact precision cosmology using galaxy clustering, lensing, and
supernova Ia distances. Similarly, LSS imprints in other Galactic templates can
affect intensity mapping and cosmic microwave background experiments. This
paper presents a generic way to remove LSS traces in Galactic maps and applies
it to SFD. First, we measure descriptive summary statistics of the CIB in SFD
by cross-correlating the map with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars in SDSS
tomographically as functions of redshift and angular scale. To reconstruct the
LSS on the map level, however, additional information on the phases is needed.
We build a large set of 180 overcomplete, full-sky basis template maps from the
density fields of over 450 million galaxies in WISE and find a linear
combination that reproduces all the high-dimensional tomographic two-point
statistics of the CIB in SFD. After subtracting this reconstructed LSS/CIB
field, the end product is a full-sky Galactic dust reddening map that
supersedes SFD, carrying all Galactic features therein, with maximally
suppressed CIB. We release this new dust map dubbed CSFD, the Corrected SFD, to

to predict the value of the ground truth labels. However, since their
predictions are not perfect, these systems also need to make human experts
understand when and how to use these predictions to update their own
predictions. Unfortunately, this has been proven challenging. In this context,
it has been recently argued that an alternative type of decision support
systems may circumvent this challenge. Rather than providing a single label
prediction, these systems provide a set of label prediction values constructed
using a conformal predictor, namely a prediction set, and forcefully ask
experts to predict a label value from the prediction set. However, the design
and evaluation of these systems have so far relied on stylized expert models,
questioning their promise. In this paper, we revisit the design of this type of
systems from the perspective of online learning and develop a methodology that
does not require, nor assumes, an expert model. Our methodology leverages the
nested structure of the prediction sets provided by any conformal predictor and
a natural counterfactual monotonicity assumption on the experts' predictions
over the prediction sets to achieve an exponential improvement in regret in
comparison with vanilla bandit algorithms. We conduct a large-scale human
subject study ($n = 2{,}751$) to verify our counterfactual monotonicity
assumption and compare our methodology to several competitive baselines. The
results suggest that decision support systems that limit experts' level of
agency may be practical and may offer greater performance than those allowing

actions over time often learn from experience by reflecting on specific cases

better outcomes. While recent machine learning methods to retrospectively
analyze sequential decision making processes promise to aid decision makers in
identifying such cases, they have focused on environments with finitely many
discrete states. However, in many practical applications, the state of the
environment is inherently continuous in nature. In this paper, we aim to fill
this gap. We start by formally characterizing a sequence of discrete actions
and continuous states using finite horizon Markov decision processes and a
broad class of bijective structural causal models. Building upon this
characterization, we formalize the problem of finding counterfactually optimal
action sequences and show that, in general, we cannot expect to solve it in
polynomial time. Then, we develop a search method based on the $A^*$ algorithm
that, under a natural form of Lipschitz continuity of the environment's
dynamics, is guaranteed to return the optimal solution to the problem.
Experiments on real clinical data show that our method is very efficient in
practice, and it has the potential to offer interesting insights for sequential
decision making tasks.

prism/clear configuration (but also using information from the

the galaxy population, reaching stellar masses Mstar as low as 10^7 Msun . We
find that the correlation between Balmer decrement and Mstar is already
established at these high redshifts, indicating a rapid build up of dust in
moderately massive galaxies at such early epochs. The lowest-mass galaxies in
our sample (Mstar = 1-3 x 10^7 Msun ) display a remarkably low Balmer decrement
of 2.88 $\pm$ 0.08, consistent with case B, suggesting very little dust
content. However, we warn that such a low observed Balmer decrement may also
partly be a consequence of an intrinsically lower H$\alpha$/ H$\beta$,
resulting from the extreme conditions of the ionized gas in these primeval and
unevolved systems. We further compare the Balmer decrement to continuum-derived
star-formation rates (SFR), finding tentative evidence of a correlation, which
likely traces the underlying connection between SFR and mass of cold gas.

computed tomography (CT) scans.
  Methods: We created a large-scale dataset of 10,021 thoracic CTs with 157
labels and applied an ensemble of 3D anatomy segmentation models to extract
anatomical pseudo-labels. These labels were projected onto a two-dimensional
plane, similar to the CXR, allowing the training of detailed semantic
segmentation models for CXR without any manual annotation effort.
  Results: Our resulting segmentation models demonstrated remarkable
performance on CXR, with a high average model-annotator agreement between two
radiologists with mIoU scores of 0.93 and 0.85 for frontal and lateral anatomy,
while inter-annotator agreement remained at 0.95 and 0.83 mIoU. Our anatomical
segmentations allowed for the accurate extraction of relevant explainable

  Conclusion: Our method of volumetric pseudo-labeling paired with CT
projection offers a promising approach for detailed anatomical segmentation of

important clinical implications, particularly in the analysis of various

ensure a very well-behaved representation theory upon Hilbert space. Moreover,
there are some well-known features of the representation theory leading to
subtle questions about norms on tensor products of C*-algebras, and thus to the
subclass of nuclear C*-algebras. The question whether all separable nuclear
C*-algebras satisfy the Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT) remains one of the
most important open problems in the structure and classification theory of such
algebras. One of the most promising ways to test the UCT conjecture depends on
finding C*-algebras that behave as idempotents under the tensor product, and
satisfy certain additional properties. Briefly put, %it has been shown
\cite{FarahCalkin} that if there exists a simple, separable, and nuclear
C*-algebra that is an idempotent under the tensor product, satisfies a certain
technical property, and is not one of the already known such elements $\left\{
O_\infty, O_2, \UHF , J, Z, \C, \compact \right\}$ then the UCT fails. Although
we do not disprove the UCT in this publication, we do find new idempotents in
the class of Villadsen algebras.

  Gender bias in language technologies has been widely studied, but research
has mostly been restricted to a binary paradigm of gender. It is essential also
to consider non-binary gender identities, as excluding them can cause further
harm to an already marginalized group. In this paper, we comprehensively
evaluate popular language models for their ability to correctly use English
gender-neutral pronouns (e.g., singular they, them) and neo-pronouns (e.g., ze,
xe, thon) that are used by individuals whose gender identity is not represented
by binary pronouns. We introduce MISGENDERED, a framework for evaluating large
language models' ability to correctly use preferred pronouns, consisting of (i)
instances declaring an individual's pronoun, followed by a sentence with a
missing pronoun, and (ii) an experimental setup for evaluating masked and
auto-regressive language models using a unified method. When prompted
out-of-the-box, language models perform poorly at correctly predicting
neo-pronouns (averaging 7.6% accuracy) and gender-neutral pronouns (averaging
31.0% accuracy). This inability to generalize results from a lack of
representation of non-binary pronouns in training data and memorized
associations. Few-shot adaptation with explicit examples in the prompt improves
the performance but plateaus at only 45.4% for neo-pronouns. We release the

flexible polymers such as hyaluronic acid (HA). The interplay between different

we use 2D coarse-grained models to study the nonlinear strain-stiffening

incompressibility of HA. We also perform rheology experiments on composites of
collagen with HA. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the

software package for parametric survival modelling of individual-level,
right-censored data, optionally combined with summary survival data on one or
more time periods. It could be used to estimate long-term survival based on
short-term data from a clinical trial, combined with longer-term disease
registry or population data, or elicited judgements. All data sources are
represented jointly in a Bayesian model. The hazard is modelled as an M-spline
function, which can represent potential changes in the hazard trajectory at any
time. Through Bayesian estimation, the model automatically adapts to fit the
available data, and acknowledges uncertainty where the data are weak. Therefore
long-term estimates are only confident if there are strong long-term data, and
inferences do not rely on extrapolating parametric functions learned from
short-term data. The effects of treatment or other explanatory variables can be
estimated through proportional hazards or with a flexible non-proportional
hazards model. Some commonly-used mechanisms for survival can also be assumed:
cure models, additive hazards models with known background mortality, and
models where the effect of a treatment wanes over time. All of these features
are provided for the first time in an R package, $\texttt{survextrap}$, in
which models can be fitted using standard R survival modelling syntax. This
paper explains the model, and demonstrates the use of the package to fit a

  Three Radial Zones in Filament Cross-Sections","30 pages, 20 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We analyze the internal cross-section structure and dynamics of inter-halo
cosmic-web filaments that connect to massive high-$z$ galaxies. Our analysis is
based on a high-resolution \texttt{AREPO} cosmological simulation zooming in on
a volume encompassing three filaments of $\sim 1 \, \Mpc$ length feeding three
massive haloes of $\sim 10^{12}\,\msun$ at $z \sim 4$, embedded in a
large-scale sheet. Each filament is surrounded by a strong cylindrical
accretion shock of radius $r_{\rm shock} \sim 50 \kpc$, within which the gas is
in virial equilibrium in the potential well set by an isothermal dark-matter
filament. The cross-section of the filament can be divided into three radial
zones. In the outer ``thermal'' (\textbf{T}) zone, $r \geq 0.65 \, r_{\rm
shock}$, the inward gravity and ram-pressure forces from the inflowing gas are
over-balanced by outward thermal pressure forces, causing the inflowing gas to
decelerate and the shock to expand outwards. In the intermediate ``vortex''
(\textbf{V}) zone, $0.25 \leq r/ r_{\rm shock} \leq 0.65$, the velocity field
is dominated by a quadrupolar vortex structure due to offset inflow along the
sheet through the post-shock gas. The outward force is provided mainly by
centrifugal forces associated with these vortices and, to a lesser extent, by
global rotation and thermal pressure, while shear and turbulent forces that are
also associated with the vortex structure add to the force inward. The inner
``stream'' (\textbf{S}) zone, $r < 0.25 \, r_{\rm shock}$, is a dense
isothermal core defining the cold streams that feed the galaxies, with $T\sim 3
\times 10^4 \, \Kdegree$ and $n_{\rm H}\sim 0.01 \cmc$. The core is formed by
an isobaric cooling flow that results from post-shock cooling on a free-fall
time, and is associated with a decrease in the outward forces, though the gas
within the core exhibits both inflows and outflows. [abridged]

the linearized Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood. In contrast to
previous estimators, these bounds are amenable to stochastic-gradient-based

develops a helmet-streamer configuration, characterized by outflows along open

of the trapped material to rise in time compared to the polar outflow regions,
ultimately leading to the expulsion of this matter from the closed zone on a
timescale of $\sim$60 ms, consistent with the predictions of
\citet{Thompson03}. The high entropies of these transient ejecta are still
growing at the end of our simulations and are sufficient to enable a successful

essentially organized and described by the underlying discourse, and thus
dialogue disentanglement requires the full understanding and harnessing of the

disentanglement by taking full advantage of the dialogue discourse
characteristics. First of all, \textbf{in feature encoding stage}, we construct
the heterogeneous graph representations to model the various dialogue-specific
discourse structural features, including the static speaker-role structures
(i.e., speaker-utterance and speaker-mentioning structure) and the dynamic
contextual structures (i.e., the utterance-distance and partial-replying
structure). We then develop a structure-aware framework to integrate the rich
structural features for better modeling the conversational semantic context.
Second, \textbf{in model learning stage}, we perform optimization with a
hierarchical ranking loss mechanism, which groups dialogue utterances into
different discourse levels and carries training covering pair-wise and
session-wise levels hierarchically. Third, \textbf{in inference stage}, we
devise an easy-first decoding algorithm, which performs utterance pairing under
the easy-to-hard manner with a global context, breaking the constraint of
traditional sequential decoding order. On two benchmark datasets, our overall
system achieves new state-of-the-art performances on all evaluations. In-depth

higher expressivity compared to more rigid rule-based and tree-based
approaches. The classifier is trained using native local optimization
techniques, efficiently searching the space of feasible formulas. Shallow rules
can be determined by fast Integer Linear Programming (ILP) or Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) solvers, potentially powered by
special purpose hardware or quantum devices. We combine the expressivity and
efficiency of the native local optimizer with the fast operation of these

several baselines on well-known public datasets. Based on the results, we find
that the native local rule classifier is generally competitive with the other

learn operators between function spaces from an essentially

we combine prior work in both the finite-dimensional ReLU and operator learning
setting by giving sharp conditions under which ReLU layers with linear neural
operators are injective. We then consider the case the case when the activation
function is pointwise bijective and obtain sufficient conditions for the layer
to be injective. We remark that this question, while trivial in the finite-rank
case, is subtler in the infinite-rank case and is proved using tools from
Fredholm theory. Next, we prove that our supplied injective neural operators
are universal approximators and that their implementation, with finite-rank
neural networks, are still injective. This ensures that injectivity is not
`lost' in the transcription from analytical operators to their finite-rank
implementation with networks. Finally, we conclude with an increase in
abstraction and consider general conditions when subnetworks, which may be many
layers deep, are injective and surjective and provide an exact inversion from a
`linearization.' This section uses general arguments from Fredholm theory and
Leray-Schauder degree theory for non-linear integral equations to analyze the
mapping properties of neural operators in function spaces. These results apply
to subnetworks formed from the layers considered in this work, under natural

However,
the market and the environment of economy is unstable and usually not
predictable. Furthermore, engaging in stock trading requires time and effort to
analyze, create strategies, and make decisions. It would be convenient and
effective if an agent could assist or even do the task of analyzing and
modeling the past data and then generate a strategy for autonomous trading.
Recently, reinforcement learning has been shown to be robust in various tasks
that involve achieving a goal with a decision making strategy based on
time-series data. In this project, we have developed a pipeline that simulates
the stock trading environment and have trained an agent to automate the stock
trading process with deep reinforcement learning methods, including deep
Q-learning, deep SARSA, and the policy gradient method. We evaluate our
platform during relatively good (before 2021) and bad (2021 - 2022) situations.
The stocks we've evaluated on including Google, Apple, Tesla, Meta, Microsoft,
and IBM. These stocks are among the popular ones, and the changes in trends are
representative in terms of having good and bad situations. We showed that
before 2021, the three reinforcement methods we have tried always provide
promising profit returns with total annual rates around $70\%$ to $90\%$, while
maintain a positive profit return after 2021 with total annual rates around 2%

derive a kinetic equation for weak interaction of internal waves using
non-canonical variables. We follow a formalism introduced by P. Ripa in the
80's. The advantage of this formalism is that it describes the system in terms
of the natural linear eigenfunctions of eastward and westward propagating
internal waves. Using properties of orthogonality of the eigenfunctions with
respect to a (pseudo) metric set by the energy we can write non perturbative
theory for the interaction of waves given in terms of the expansion amplitudes.
The evolution is controlled by a system of equations, with quadratic
nonlinearity, which is an exact representation of the original model equations.
The dynamics is constrained by the conservation of energy and pseudo-momentum,
which can be written simply as a linear combination of the squared absolute
value of the amplitudes. The possibility of a generalization of the Fjortoft's
argument to internal gravity waves and observation of a non trivial double
cascade of energy and pseudo-momentum is discussed.

identify the right scale for coarse-graining, or equivalently, the right number

Voronoi models, which differ only in their representation of the degrees of
freedom, have effectively been used to predict behavior, including fluid-solid
transitions and cell tissue compartmentalization, which are important for
biological function. However, recent work in 2D has hinted that there may be
differences between the two models in systems with heterotypic interfaces
between two tissue types, and there is a burgeoning interest in 3D tissue
models. Therefore, we compare the geometric structure and dynamic sorting
behavior in mixtures of two cell types in both 3D vertex and Voronoi models. We
find that while the cell shape indices exhibit similar trends in both models,
the registration between cell centers and cell orientation at the boundary are
significantly different between the two models. We demonstrate that these
macroscopic differences are caused by changes to the cusp-like restoring forces
introduced by the different representations of the degrees of freedom at the
boundary, and that the Voronoi model is more strongly constrained by forces
that are an artifact of the way the degrees of freedom are represented. This
suggests that vertex models may be more appropriate for 3D simulations of
tissues with heterotypic contacts.

centrifugal magnetospheres (CMs), as the relatively weak stellar wind becomes
magnetically confined and centrifugally supported above the Kepler co-rotation
radius. CM plasma is concentrated at and above the Kepler co-rotation radius at
the intersection between the rotation and magnetic field axis. Stellar rotation
can cause these clouds of material to intersect the viewer's line-of-sight,
leading to photometric eclipses. However, for stars with strong ($\sim 10\,{\rm
kG}$) magnetic fields and rapid rotation, CMs can become optically thick enough
for emission to occur via electron scattering. Using high-precision space
photometry from a sample of stars with strong H$\alpha$ emission, we apply
simulated light curves from the Rigidly Rotating Magnetosphere model to
directly infer magnetic and rotational properties of these stars. By comparing
the values inferred from photometric modelling to those independently
determined by spectropolarimetry, we find that magnetic obliquity angle
$\beta$, viewer inclination $i$ and critical rotation fraction $W$ can be
approximately recovered for 3 of the 4 stars studied here. However, there are
large discrepancies between the optical depth at the Kepler radius $\tau_{\rm

observations. We show that $\tau_{\rm K}$ of order unity is needed to
reasonably match the light curve morphology of our sample stars.

Prevailing numerical evidence, however, appears to indicate that an SSD is
unlikely to exist at very low magnetic Prandtl numbers ($Pr_M$) such as are
present in the Sun and other cool stars. We have performed high-resolution
simulations of isothermal forced turbulence employing the lowest $Pr_M$ values

possible for $Pr_M$ down to 0.0031, but even becomes increasingly easier to
excite for $Pr_M$ below $\simeq\,$0.05. We relate this behaviour to the known

the glass transition (MCT). Our results show that a high degree of
polydispersity tends to stabilize the liquid phase against vitrification, the
magnitude of which depends on the shape of the polydispersity distribution.
Further, we report on a separation between the localization lengths of the
smallest and largest particles. A diameter-resolved analysis of the
intermediate scattering functions reveals that this separation significantly
stretches the relaxation patterns, which we quantitatively study by an analysis
of the dynamical exponents predicted by the theory. Our observations have
strong implications for our understanding of the nature of dynamical
heterogeneities and localization lengths in continuously polydisperse systems.

However, none of these methods can cope with the rapid growth of network

resulting in packet loss, delay and inadequate QoS delivery. Recently, a deep

a dynamic traffic classifier that can detect elephant flows to prevent network

promising algorithms that does not require human class labeler. It achieves an
accuracy of 97.95% with a loss of 0.13 . Since the loss value is closer to

efforts to create, maintain, and update the lexicons. These methods are also
considered inferior to the deep learning-based approaches, such as transformer
models, which have become dominant in various NLP tasks due to their remarkable

resources for both training and testing. Additionally, they involve significant
prediction times, making them unsuitable for real-time production environments
or systems with limited processing capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a
novel methodology named eXplainable Lexicons (XLex) that combines the
advantages of both lexicon-based methods and transformer models. We propose an
approach that utilizes transformers and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)
for explainability to learn financial lexicons. Our study presents four main
contributions. Firstly, we demonstrate that transformer-aided explainable
lexicons can enhance the vocabulary coverage of the benchmark Loughran-McDonald

updating the lexicons. Secondly, we show that the resulting lexicon outperforms
the standard LM lexicon in SA of financial datasets. Thirdly, we illustrate
that the lexicon-based approach is significantly more efficient in terms of
model speed and size compared to transformers. Lastly, the XLex approach is
inherently more interpretable than transformer models as lexicon models rely on
predefined rules, allowing for better insights into the results of SA and
making the XLex approach a viable tool for financial decision-making.

a lack of uniformity between train and test metrics. This work integrates a
quality-aware learning process at the sample level into the classification
training paradigm (QAFace). In this regard, Softmax centers are adaptively
guided to pay more attention to low-quality samples by using a quality-aware

of traditional memory architectures by enabling memory to be decoupled from
compute nodes and shared across a data center. Cloud platforms have deployed
such systems to improve overall system memory utilization, but performance can
vary across workloads. High-performance computing (HPC) is crucial in
scientific and engineering applications, where HPC machines also face the issue
of underutilized memory. As a result, improving system memory utilization while
understanding workload performance is essential for HPC operators. Therefore,
learning the potential of a disaggregated memory system before deployment is a
critical step. This paper proposes a methodology for exploring the design space
of a disaggregated memory system. It incorporates key metrics that affect
performance on disaggregated memory systems: memory capacity, local and remote
memory access ratio, injection bandwidth, and bisection bandwidth, providing an
intuitive approach to guide machine configurations based on technology trends
and workload characteristics. We apply our methodology to analyze thirteen
diverse workloads, including AI training, data analysis, genomics, protein,
fusion, atomic nuclei, and traditional HPC bookends. Our methodology
demonstrates the ability to comprehend the potential and pitfalls of a
disaggregated memory system and provides motivation for machine configurations.
Our results show that eleven of our thirteen applications can leverage
injection bandwidth disaggregated memory without affecting performance, while
one pays a rack bisection bandwidth penalty and two pay the system-wide
bisection bandwidth penalty. In addition, we also show that intra-rack memory
disaggregation would meet the application's memory requirement and provide
enough remote memory bandwidth. }

simulations for cosmology and galaxy cluster physics. To ensure the simulations
are sufficiently realistic for studies of large-scale structure, the subgrid
prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback are calibrated to the observed
low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function and cluster gas fractions. The
calibration is performed using machine learning, separately for three
resolutions. This approach enables specification of the model by the
observables to which they are calibrated. The calibration accounts for a number
of potential observational biases and for random errors in the observed stellar
masses. The two most demanding simulations have box sizes of 1.0 and 2.8 Gpc
and baryonic particle masses of $1\times10^8$ and $1\times10^9 \text{M}_\odot$,
respectively. For the latter resolution the suite includes 12 model variations
in a 1 Gpc box. There are 8 variations at fixed cosmology, including shifts in
the stellar mass function and/or the cluster gas fractions to which we
calibrate, and two alternative implementations of AGN feedback (thermal or
jets). The remaining 4 variations use the unmodified calibration data but
different cosmologies, including different neutrino masses. The 2.8 Gpc
simulation follows $3\times10^{11}$ particles, making it the largest ever
hydrodynamical simulation run to $z=0$. Lightcone output is produced on-the-fly
for up to 8 different observers. We investigate numerical convergence, show
that the simulations reproduce the calibration data, and compare with a number
of galaxy, cluster, and large-scale structure observations, finding very good
agreement with the data for converged predictions. Finally, by comparing
hydrodynamical and `dark-matter-only' simulations, we confirm that baryonic
effects can suppress the halo mass function and the matter power spectrum by up
to $\approx20$ per cent.

and observational data to novel conditions. While it is in principle possible
to eventually learn a mapping from a novel experimental condition to an outcome
of interest, provided a sufficient variety of experiments is available in the
training data, coping with a large combinatorial space of possible
interventions is hard. Under a typical sparse experimental design, this mapping
is ill-posed without relying on heavy regularization or prior distributions.
Such assumptions may or may not be reliable, and can be hard to defend or test.
In this paper, we take a close look at how to warrant a leap from past
experiments to novel conditions based on minimal assumptions about the
factorization of the distribution of the manipulated system, communicated in
the well-understood language of factor graph models. A postulated
$\textit{interventional factor model}$ (IFM) may not always be informative, but
it conveniently abstracts away a need for explicit unmeasured confounding and
feedback mechanisms, leading to directly testable claims. We derive necessary
and sufficient conditions for causal effect identifiability with IFMs using
data from a collection of experimental settings, and implement practical
algorithms for generalizing expected outcomes to novel conditions never
observed in the data.

on undesirable prior assumptions. To tackle these issues, we introduce a class
of tools for language models called guides that use state and incremental
constraints to guide generation. A guide can be invoked by the model to
constrain its own generation to a set of valid statements given by the tool. In
turn, the model's choices can change the guide's state. We show how a general

Given a reasoning problem in natural language, a model can formalize its
assumptions for LogicGuide and then guarantee that its reasoning steps are
sound. In experiments with the PrOntoQA and ProofWriter reasoning datasets,
LogicGuide significantly improves the performance of GPT-3, GPT-3.5 Turbo and

ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared imaging surveys to investigate the
interplay between stellar structure, star formation and HI structural
parameters. We quantify the HI structure by the size of the HI relative to the
optical disc and the average HI surface density measured using effective and
isodensity radii. For galaxies resolved by >1.3 beams, we find that galaxies
with higher stellar masses and stellar surface densities tend to have less
extended HI discs and lower HI surface densities: the isodensity HI structural
parameters show a weak negative dependence on stellar mass and stellar mass
surface density. These trends strengthen when we limit our sample to galaxies
resolved by >2 beams. We find that galaxies with higher HI surface densities
and more extended HI discs tend to be more star forming: the isodensity HI
structural parameters have stronger correlations with star formation.
Normalising the HI disc size by the optical effective radius (instead of the
isophotal radius) produces positive correlations with stellar masses and
stellar surface densities and removes the correlations with star formation.
This is due to the effective and isodensity HI radii increasing with mass at
similar rates while, in the optical, the effective radius increases slower than
the isophotal radius. Our results demonstrate that with WALLABY we can begin to
bridge the gap between small galaxy samples with high spatial resolution HI
data and large, statistical studies using spatially unresolved, single-dish

turbulent flows with thin boundary layers, providing good agreement with
experiments, Fedoseyev and Alexeev (1998, 2010, 2012), Fedoseyev (2000, 2001a,
2001b). The GHE model has also been applied to the hypersonic flows which are
very challenging problems as such flows can exhibit both continuum and
non-continuum flow regimes. The results by Fedoseyev (2020), Fedoseyev and
Griaznov (2021) and Fedoseyev, Griaznov and Ouazzani (2022) demonstarted good
agreement with experiments, including the highly rarefied flows.
  In this work an approximate analytical solution of the GHE for turbulent flow
in channel is presented. The solution is a superposition of the laminar
(parabolic) and turbulent (superexponential) solutions.
  The analytical solution compares well with the experimental data by Van
Doorne (2007) for axial velocity and data by Nikuradse (1933) for axial
velocity, for flows in pipes. It helps to explain the nature of turbulence as
oscillations between the laminar (parabolic) and turbulent (superexponential)
solutions. Good comparison of the analytical formula, a difference of the
parabolic and superexponential solutions, for turbulent velocity fluctuations
with the experiment by Doorne (2007) confirmed this suggestion. The
Navier-Stokes equations can not have such superexponential solution.
  The obtained analytical solution provides a complete structure of the
turbulent boundary layer that compares well with the experiments by Wei and
Willmarth (1989). It also presents an explicit verifiable proof that Alexeev's
generalized hydrodynamic theory (GHE) is in closer agreement with experiments
for turbulent flows than currently available theories.

of operators includes the quasi-Hermitian operators, which reformulate quantum
theory while retaining real-valued measurement outcomes and unitary time
evolution. This thesis is devoted to the study of locality in quasi-Hermitian
theory, the symmetries and conserved quantities associated with non-Hermitian
operators, and the perturbative features of pseudo-Hermitian matrices. In
addition to the presented original research, scholars will appreciate the
lengthy introduction to non-Hermitian physics.
  Local quasi-Hermitian observable algebras are examined. Expectation values of
local quasi-Hermitian observables equal expectation values of local Hermitian
observables. Thus, quasi-Hermitian theories do not increase the values of
nonlocal games set by Hermitian theories. Furthermore, Bell's inequality
violations in quasi-Hermitian theories never exceed the Tsirelson bound of
Hermitian quantum theory.
  Exceptional points, which are branch points in the spectrum, are a
perturbative feature unique to non-Hermitian operators. Cusp singularities of
algebraic curves are related to higher-order exceptional points.
  To exemplify novelties of non-Hermiticity, one-dimensional lattice models
with a pair of non-Hermitian defect potentials with balanced loss and gain,
$\Delta \pm i \gamma$, are explored. When the defects are nearest neighbour,
the entire spectrum becomes complex when $\gamma$ is tuned past a second-order
exceptional point. When the defects are at the edges of the chain and the
hopping amplitudes are 2-periodic, as in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain, the
$\mathcal{PT}$-phase transition is dictated by the topological phase.
  Chiral symmetry and representation theory are used to derive large classes of

not only possess the ability to use audio-visual cues effectively, but also be
equipped to actively (but occasionally) seek human/oracle assistance without
sacrificing autonomy, e.g., when it is uncertain of where to navigate towards
locating a noisy or sporadic audio goal. To this end, we present CAVEN -- a
conversational audio-visual embodied navigation agent that is capable of posing
navigation questions to a human/oracle and processing the oracle responses;
both in free-form natural language. At the core of CAVEN is a multimodal
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) setup that is equipped with a
high-level policy that is trained to choose from one of three low-level
policies (at every step), namely: (i) to navigate using audio-visual cues, or
(ii) to frame a question to the oracle and receive a short or detailed
response, or (iii) ask generic questions (when unsure of what to ask) and
receive instructions. Key to generating the agent's questions is our novel
TrajectoryNet that forecasts the most likely next steps to the goal and a
QuestionNet that uses these steps to produce a question. All the policies are
learned end-to-end via the RL setup, with penalties to enforce sparsity in
receiving navigation instructions from the oracle. To evaluate the performance
of CAVEN, we present extensive experiments on the SoundSpaces framework for the
task of semantic audio-visual navigation. Our results show that CAVEN achieves
upto 12% gain in performance over competing methods, especially in localizing
new sound sources, even in the presence of auditory distractions.

  Robots",,,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Inflated-beam soft robots, such as tip-everting vine robots, can control
their curvature by contracting one side of the beam using pneumatic actuation.
In this work, a general finite element modeling approach is developed and
applied to characterize bending of inflated-beam soft robots. The model is
tested on four types of pneumatic actuators used in these robots (series,
compression, embedded, and fabric pneumatic artificial muscles) and can be
extended to other designs. Actuators rely on two types of bending mechanisms:
geometry-based contraction and material-based contraction. Geometry-based
contraction implies shape-change of the muscles from a flat to an inflated
shortened configuration that causes buckling of the inflated beam.
Material-based contraction relies on material anisotropy to produce a
contraction effect. The model depicts both mechanisms and accommodates for the
complex and highly nonlinear effects of buckling and anisotropy. Simulation
results are verified experimentally for each actuator type at three working
pressures (10, 20, and 30 kPa). Geometry-based contraction achieves the largest
deformation at accuracy values of 92.1% and higher once the buckling pattern is
established, and 80.7% and higher for lower pressures due to the stress
singularities occurring with buckling formation. Material-based contraction
achieves smaller bending angles but is at least 96.7% accurate. The models are
freely available online, and can thus be used by others to design inflated-beam
robots, such as tip-everting vine robots. Labor and material waste can be
reduced with this tool by optimizing designs that use knowledge of material
properties and stress to distributions to enable bending and manage stress
peaks.

has been extensively studied using all available observational methods,
including using the newly available technique of sensitive X-ray polarimetry.
X-ray polarization characteristics are distinct for coronal and jet emissions.
The low X-ray polarization measured below $\sim$100 keV is understood as
arising from the corona. In contrast, the high polarization measurements
reported above $\sim$400 keV required a separate jet-dominated spectral
component, which spectroscopy does not demonstrate conclusively. Here we report
precise polarization measurements in the 100-380 keV region made during three
different sub-classes of spectral states of the source using the CZTI

mainly in the Intermediate Hard State of the source, and the energy-resolved
measurements smoothly connect the coronal and the jet regimes. When high
polarization is observed, the simultaneous spectral data hints at a separate
power law component above 100 keV. We examine the possible sources of this

the radiation field transfers both momentum and energy to the plasma. At parsec
scale distances in AGN, energy transfer can dominate, in which case the only
force needed to launch an outflow is that from gas pressure. Much closer to the
black hole, gravity dominates thermal energy due to insufficient heating by the
radiation and the gas is in the so-called `cold' regime. Only magnetic or
radiation forces can then lead to outflow, but it is unclear at what
temperature and ionization state the radiation force weakens, as these
properties depend on the spectral energy distribution (SED). In this work, we
survey the parameter space of radiation forces due to spectral lines resulting
from blackbody SEDs with varying temperatures in the range $\sim 10^4 - 10^6$~K
to identify the radiation temperature at which line-driving begins to lose
efficiency. We find that the temperature $\lesssim4\times10^5$~K marks the
transition to inefficient line driving. We also self-consistently compute the
heating and cooling balance to estimate the gas temperature, so that our
parameter survey covers the transition where thermal driving goes from
negligible to comparable to line driving. We summarize a large set of
hydrodynamical simulations of radial flows to illustrate how the wind
properties change during the transition and the dependence of these properties

extensive experiments with prefix tuning, prompt tuning, and adapter tuning on
different language models and bias types to evaluate their debiasing
performance and abilities to preserve the internal knowledge of a pre-trained

allow us to probe the strong-field dynamics of general relativity (GR). One can
compare the observed gravitational-wave signals with theoretical waveform
models to constrain possible deviations from GR. Any physics that is not
included in these waveform models might show up as apparent GR deviations. The
waveform models used in current tests of GR describe binaries on quasicircular
orbits, since most of the binaries detected by ground-based gravitational-wave
detectors are expected to have negligible eccentricities. Thus, a signal from
an eccentric binary in GR is likely to show up as a deviation from GR in the
current implementation of these tests. We study the response of four standard
tests of GR to eccentric binary black hole signals with the forecast O4
sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Specifically, we consider two
parameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test, and
the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. To model eccentric signals, we
use non-spinning numerical relativity simulations from the SXS catalog with
three mass ratios $(1,2,3)$, which we scale to a redshifted total mass of
$80M_\odot$ and luminosity distance of $400$ Mpc. For each of these mass
ratios, we consider signals with eccentricities of $\sim0.05$ and $\sim 0.1$ at
$17$ Hz. We find that signals with larger eccentricity lead to very significant
false GR deviations in most tests while signals having smaller eccentricity
lead to significant deviations in some tests. For the larger eccentricity
cases, one would even get a deviation from GR with TIGER at $\sim 90\%$
credibility at a distance of $\gtrsim 1.5$ Gpc. Thus, it will be necessary to
exclude the possibility of an eccentric binary in order to make any claim about
detecting a deviation from GR.

massless signals. Namely, a massive brane curves the spacetime and affects the
trajectory of a signal in a way that allows a signal sent from the brane
through the bulk to arrive (upon returning) to a distant point on the brane
faster than the light can propagate along the brane. In particular, the signal
sent along the brane suffers a greater gravitational time delay than the bulk
signal due to the presence of matter on the brane. While the bulk signal never
moves with the speed greater than the speed of light in its own locality, this
effect still enables one to send signals faster than light from the brane
observer's perspective. For example, this effect might be used to resolve the
cosmological horizon problem. In addition, one of the striking observational
signatures would be arrival of the same gravitational wave signal at two
different times, where the first signals arrives before its electromagnetic
counterpart. We used GW170104 gravitational wave event to impose a strong limit

laser -- in such systems, the solitons manifest themselves as unique attractors
whose carrier frequency coincides with that of the external driving field.
Recent experiments have, however, shown that a qualitatively different type of
temporal soliton can arise via parametric down-conversion in resonators with
simultaneous quadratic and cubic nonlinearity. In contrast to conventional
solitons in pure-Kerr resonators, these parametrically driven solitons come in
two different flavours with opposite phases, and they are spectrally centred at
half of the frequency of the driving field. Here, we theoretically predict and
experimentally demonstrate that parametrically driven solitons can also arise
in resonators with pure Kerr nonlinearity under conditions of bichromatic
driving. In this case, the solitons arise through four-wave mixing mediated
phase-sensitive amplification, come with two distinct phases, and have a
carrier frequency in between the two external driving fields. Our experiments
are performed in an integrated silicon nitride microcavity, and we observe
frequency comb spectra in good agreement with theoretical predictions. In
addition to representing a fundamental discovery of a new type of temporal
dissipative soliton, our results constitute the first unequivocal realisation

eccentricities. A recently developed prior framework for orbit fitting called
''observable-based priors'' has the advantage of improving biases in derived
orbit parameters for objects with minimal phase coverage, which is the case for
the majority of directly imaged companions. We use observable-based priors to
fit the orbits of 21 exoplanets and brown dwarfs in an effort to obtain the
eccentricity distributions with minimized biases. We present the objects'
individual posteriors compared to their previously derived distributions,
showing in many cases a shift toward lower eccentricities. We analyze the
companions' eccentricity distribution at a population level, and compare this
to the distributions obtained with the traditional uniform priors. We fit a
Beta distribution to our posteriors using observable-based priors, obtaining
shape parameters $\alpha = 1.09^{+0.30}_{-0.22}$ and $\beta =
1.42^{+0.33}_{-0.25}$. This represents an approximately flat distribution of
eccentricities. The derived $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters are consistent with
the values obtained using uniform priors, though uniform priors lead to a tail
at high eccentricities. We find that separating the population into high and
low mass companions yields different distributions depending on the
classification of intermediate mass objects. We also determine via simulation
that the minimal orbit coverage needed to give meaningful posteriors under the
assumptions made for directly imaged planets is $\approx$ 15% of the inferred
period of the orbit.

First, although the CNN branch can capture image local features by using
convolution operation, the vanilla convolution is unable to achieve adaptive
extraction of image features. Second, although the Transformer branch can model
the global information of images, the conventional self-attention only focuses
on the spatial self-attention of images and ignores the channel and
cross-dimensional self-attention leading to low segmentation accuracy for
medical images with complex backgrounds. To solve these problems, we propose
vision Transformer embrace convolutional neural networks for medical image
segmentation (TEC-Net). Our network has two advantages. First, dynamic
deformable convolution (DDConv) is designed in the CNN branch, which not only
overcomes the difficulty of adaptive feature extraction using fixed-size
convolution kernels, but also solves the defect that different inputs share the
same convolution kernel parameters, effectively improving the feature
expression ability of CNN branch. Second, in the Transformer branch, a
(shifted)-window adaptive complementary attention module ((S)W-ACAM) and
compact convolutional projection are designed to enable the network to fully
learn the cross-dimensional long-range dependency of medical images with few

TEC-Net provides better medical image segmentation results than SOTA methods

multi-agent environmental dynamics from historical National Basketball

strategies, an auxiliary value function is trained using the play-by-play data
with corresponding rewards acting as the plan guidance. To accomplish
reward-guided trajectory generation, conditional sampling is introduced to
condition the diffusion model on the value function and conduct
classifier-guided sampling. We validate the effectiveness of PLAYBEST via
comprehensive simulation studies from real-world data, contrasting the
generated trajectories and play strategies with those employed by professional
basketball teams. Our results reveal that the model excels at generating
high-quality basketball trajectories that yield efficient plays, surpassing
conventional planning techniques in terms of adaptability, flexibility, and

Twitter) by researchers. In order to study the network interaction between
different nodes of large-scale networks, the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model
has been popularly employed. Despite its popularity, the estimation of a SAR
model on large-scale networks remains very challenging. On the one hand, due to
policy limitations or high collection costs, it is often impossible for
independent researchers to observe or collect all network information. On the
other hand, even if the entire network is accessible, estimating the SAR model
using the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) could be computationally
infeasible due to its high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
propose here a subnetwork estimation method based on QMLE for the SAR model. By
using appropriate sampling methods, a subnetwork, consisting of a much-reduced
number of nodes, can be constructed. Subsequently, the standard QMLE can be
computed by treating the sampled subnetwork as if it were the entire network.
This leads to a significant reduction in information collection and model
computation costs, which increases the practical feasibility of the effort.
Theoretically, we show that the subnetwork-based QMLE is consistent and
asymptotically normal under appropriate regularity conditions. Extensive
simulation studies, based on both simulated and real network structures, are

operator networks (DeepONets), for learning moving-solution operators of
parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), with application to real-time
earthquake localization. Leveraging the power of neural operators, X-DeepONet
learns to estimate traveltime fields associated with earthquake sources by
incorporating information from seismic arrival times and velocity models.
Similar to the DeepONet, X-DeepONet includes a trunk net and a branch net.
Additionally, we introduce a root network that not only takes the standard
DeepONet's multiplication operator as input, it also takes addition and
subtraction operators. We show that for problems with moving fields, the
standard multiplication operation of DeepONet is insufficient to capture field
relocation, while addition and subtraction operators along with the eXtended
root significantly improve its accuracy both under data-driven (supervised) and
physics-informed (unsupervised) training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
X-DeepONet through various experiments, including scenarios with variable
velocity models and arrival times. The results show remarkable accuracy in
earthquake localization, even for heterogeneous and complex velocity models.
The proposed framework also exhibits excellent generalization capabilities and
robustness against noisy arrival times. The method provides a computationally
efficient approach for quantifying uncertainty in hypocenter locations
resulting from traveltime pick errors and velocity model variations. Our
results underscore X-DeepONet's potential to improve seismic monitoring

the point where the number of available annotations changes the suitable active

that when combining active learning with self-supervised models to achieve
improved performance, the phase transition point occurs earlier. It becomes
challenging to determine which strategy should be used for previously unseen

resolution has long been a sought-after goal. Freeform nanophotonic devices are
critical building blocks for achieving this goal, as they provide access to a
design potential that could hardly be achieved by conventional fixed-shape
devices. However, finding an optimal device structure in the vast combinatorial
design space that scales exponentially with the number of freeform design
parameters has been an enormous challenge. In this study, we propose
physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) as an optimization method for
freeform nanophotonic devices, which combines the adjoint-based method with
reinforcement learning to enhance the sample efficiency of the optimization
algorithm and overcome the issue of local minima. To illustrate these
advantages of PIRL over other conventional optimization algorithms, we design a
family of one-dimensional metasurface beam deflectors using PIRL, obtaining
more performant devices. We also explore the transfer learning capability of
PIRL that further improves sample efficiency and demonstrate how the minimum
feature size of the design can be enforced in PIRL through reward engineering.
With its high sample efficiency, robustness, and ability to seamlessly
incorporate practical device design constraints, our method offers a promising
approach to highly combinatorial freeform device optimization in various
physical domains.

machine learning, which aims to predict whether a given sample was contained in
the target model's training set. Label-only membership inference attack is a
variant that exploits sample robustness and attracts more attention since it
assumes a practical scenario in which the adversary only has access to the
predicted labels of the input samples. However, since the decision boundary
distance, which measures robustness, is strongly affected by the random initial
image, the adversary may get opposite results even for the same input samples.
In this paper, we propose a new attack method, called muti-class adaptive
membership inference attack in the label-only setting. All decision boundary
distances for all target classes have been traversed in the early attack
iterations, and the subsequent attack iterations continue with the shortest
decision boundary distance to obtain a stable and optimal decision boundary
distance. Instead of using a single boundary distance, the relative boundary
distance between samples and neighboring points has also been employed as a new
membership score to distinguish between member samples inside the training set
and nonmember samples outside the training set. Experiments show that previous
label-only membership inference attacks using the untargeted HopSkipJump
algorithm fail to achieve optimal decision bounds in more than half of the
samples, whereas our multi-targeted HopSkipJump algorithm succeeds in almost
all samples. In addition, extensive experiments show that our multi-class
adaptive MIA outperforms current label-only membership inference attacks in the
CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets, especially for the true positive rate at low
false positive rates metric.

Sensitive attributes, such as race, gender, age, and medical condition, are
characteristics of individuals that are commonly associated with discrimination
or bias. In healthcare AI, these attributes can play a significant role in
determining the quality of care that individuals receive. For example, minority
groups often receive fewer procedures and poorer-quality medical care than
white individuals in US. Therefore, detecting and mitigating bias in data is
crucial to enhancing health equity. Bias mitigation methods include
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Among them, Reweighting
(RW) is a widely used pre-processing method that performs well in balancing
machine learning performance and fairness performance. RW adjusts the weights
for samples within each (group, label) combination, where these weights are
utilized in loss functions. However, RW is limited to considering only a single
sensitive attribute when mitigating bias and assumes that each sensitive
attribute is equally important. This may result in potential inaccuracies when
addressing intersectional bias. To address these limitations, we propose
M3Fair, a multi-level and multi-sensitive-attribute reweighting method by
extending the RW method to multiple sensitive attributes at multiple levels.

perturbations of the instability correspond to the distribution of active
regions observed during the solar cycles. The toroidal and poloidal flux
budgets are calculated by applying the Stokes theorem. The results are compared
with a baseline 2D dynamo model without bipolar magnetic regions and with the
synoptic observations from Kitt Peak Observatory and SoHO (Solar and

We find that while the regions of the high radial rotational shear at the
boundaries of the convection zone are important for maintaining the dynamo
process, the toroidal magnetic flux that results in the formation of BMR is
generated by the latitudinal differential rotation. The toroidal flux
generation reaches the maximum at the poles during the solar minima, which
explains the correlation between the polar field strength and the subsequent
sunspot maximum. However, we find that the generation rate of this flux
strongly depends on the radial magnetic field distribution near the solar

the model in DM mass regions where collider searches are not sensitive. The
relative EW corrections turn out to be large for scenarios with relatively
large couplings, threshold effects or small leading-order (LO) widths.
Otherwise, they are of typical EW size and can amount up to about 20-25%. The

in the one-loop corrections to charged pion and rho meson selfenergies. To
carry out this analysis we consider first a simple form for the meson-quark
interactions, and then we study the $\pi^+$ and $\rho^+$ propagators within the
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, performing a numerical analysis of the $B$ dependence
of meson lowest energy states. For both $\pi^+$ and $\rho^+$ mesons, we compare
the numerical results arising from the full calculation -- in which SPs are
included in the propagators, and meson wavefunctions correspond to states of
definite Landau quantum number -- and those obtained within alternative schemes
in which SPs are neglected (or somehow eliminated) and meson states are
described by plane waves of definite four-momentum.

investigated experimentally, in two scenarios; firstly, when the bubble is
generated in the bulk of the fluid (termed as ``free-field'' bubble) and
secondly when the bubble is generated near a free-surface (termed as
``free-surface'' bubble). The bubble is created using a low-voltage spark
circuit and its dynamics is captured using a high-speed camera with back-lit
illumination. The viscosity of the surrounding fluid is varied by using
different grades of silicone oil. For a ``free-field'' bubble, the bubble
oscillates radially and as the viscosity of the liquid increases, the number of
oscillations, as well as the time-period of each oscillation, are increased. At
high viscosities, the bubble also becomes stable and does not disintegrate into
smaller bubbles. For ``free-surface'' bubbles, two parameters, namely, the
initial distance of the bubble from the free-surface and the viscosity of the
surrounding fluid are varied. It is observed that beyond a certain initial
distance of the bubble from the free-surface, the bubble behaves as a
``free-field'' bubble with negligible influence of the free-surface on its
dynamics. This limiting initial distance decreases as the liquid viscosity is
increased and is not dependent on the bubble radius. For these bubbles,
different behaviours of the free-surface in each liquid are also presented as a
function of the two parameters.

learn the SDF for articulated robots. The learned composite SDF networks
combined with the kinematics of the robot allow for quick and accurate
estimates of the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles in a batch
fashion. Then, a stochastic optimization-based trajectory planning algorithm
generates a spatial-optimized and collision-free trajectory offline with the
learned composite SDF networks. This stochastic trajectory planner is
formulated as a Bayesian Inference problem with a time-normalized Gaussian
process prior and exponential likelihood function. The Gaussian process prior
can enforce initial and goal position constraints in Configuration Space.
Besides, it can encode the correlation of waypoints in time series. The
likelihood function aims at encoding task-related cost terms, such as collision
avoidance, trajectory length penalty, boundary avoidance, etc. The kernel
updating strategies combined with model-predictive path integral (MPPI) is
proposed to solve the maximum a posteriori inference problems. Lastly, we
integrate the learned composite SDF networks into the trajectory planning

first examine two approaches to diversify text generation: 1) logit
suppression, which minimizes the generation of languages that have already been
frequently generated, and 2) temperature sampling, which flattens the token
sampling probability. We found that diversification approaches can increase
data diversity but often at the cost of data accuracy (i.e., text and labels
being appropriate for the target domain). To address this issue, we examined
two human interventions, 1) label replacement (LR), correcting misaligned
labels, and 2) out-of-scope filtering (OOSF), removing instances that are out
of the user's domain of interest or to which no considered label applies. With
oracle studies, we found that LR increases the absolute accuracy of models
trained with diversified datasets by 14.4%. Moreover, we found that some models
trained with data generated with LR interventions outperformed LLM-based
few-shot classification. In contrast, OOSF was not effective in increasing
model accuracy, implying the need for future work in human-in-the-loop text

$\gamma$ photons via the nonlinear Compton scattering, dominated by the laser.
These $\gamma$ photons then generate polarized positrons via the nonlinear
Breit-Wheeler process, dominated by a strong self-generated quasi-static
magnetic field $\mathbf{B}^{\rm S}$. We find that placing the foil at an
appropriate angle can result in a directional orientation of $\mathbf{B}^{\rm
S}$, thereby polarizing positrons. Manipulating the laser polarization
direction can control the angle between the $\gamma$ photon polarization and
$\mathbf{B}^{\rm S}$, significantly enhancing the positron polarization degree.

calculated from the perspective of geometry. However, different techniques are
required for different scenarios in the practical implementation. This fact
leads to different GW methods. For the GW method for stationary axially

constructed by people is infinite, which is ill-defined for some asymptotically
nonflat spacetimes whose metric possesses singular behavior, and (b) the
calculation is too complicated, especially for highly accurate results and
complex spacetimes. To address these issues, a generalized GW method is
proposed in which the infinite region is replaced by a flexible region to avoid

perform an exact computation for the low-frequency Fourier modes and extract
damping in leading order estimates for the high-frequency modes using
singularly weighted norms in the energy estimates. The analysis for the viscous

use singular weights. We establish the blowup analysis for the viscous model by
carefully designing an energy norm that combines a singularly weighted energy

several unique advantages: (1) by separating ASQP into two subtasks and solving
them independently and simultaneously, we can avoid error propagation in
pipeline-based methods and overcome slow training and inference in
generation-based methods; (2) by introducing sentiment-specific horns tagging
schema in a token-pair-based two-dimensional matrix, we can exploit deeper

Despite the many successful efforts made to apply FL to wireless edge networks,
the adopted algorithms mostly follow the same spirit as FedAvg, thereby heavily
suffering from the practical challenges of label deficiency and device
heterogeneity. These challenges not only decelerate the model training in FL
but also downgrade the application performance. In this paper, we focus on the
algorithm design and address these challenges by investigating the personalized
semi-supervised FL problem and proposing an effective algorithm, namely
FedCPSL. In particular, the techniques of pseudo-labeling, and
interpolation-based model personalization are judiciously combined to provide a
new problem formulation for personalized semi-supervised FL. The proposed
FedCPSL algorithm adopts novel strategies, including adaptive client variance
reduction, local momentum, and normalized global aggregation, to combat the
challenge of device heterogeneity and boost algorithm convergence. Moreover,
the convergence property of FedCPSL is thoroughly analyzed and shows that
FedCPSL is resilient to both statistical and system heterogeneity, obtaining a
sublinear convergence rate. Experimental results on image classification tasks
are also presented to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms its
counterparts in terms of both convergence speed and application performance.

In order to expand the use cases for implicit neural representations, we need

to mitigate bias in robot decision-making for more fair services. In this
paper, we designed a self-reflective mechanism -- Fairness-Sensitive Policy
Gradient Reinforcement Learning (FSPGRL), to help robots to self-identify
biased behaviors during interactions with humans. FSPGRL identifies bias by
examining the abnormal update along particular gradients and updates the policy
network to support fair decision-making for robots. To validate FSPGRL's
effectiveness, a human-centered service scenario, ""A robot is serving people in

robots were proven to have a self-bias detection capability for a more fair

of the Poissons form are called pseudo-Poisson distributions. Such models have
simple exible dependence structures, possess fast computation algorithms and
generate a sufficiently large number of parametric families. It has been
strongly argued that the pseudo-Poisson model will be the first choice to
consider in modelling bivariate over-dispersed data with positive correlation
and having one of the marginal equi-dispersed. Yet, before we start fitting, it
is necessary to test whether the given data is compatible with the assumed
pseudo-Poisson model. Hence, in the present note we derive and propose a few
goodness-of-fit tests for the bivariate pseudo-Poisson distribution. Also we
emphasize two tests, a lesser known test based on the supremes of the absolute
difference between the estimated probability generating function and its
empirical counterpart. A new test has been proposed based on the difference
between the estimated bivariate Fisher dispersion index and its empirical
indices. However, we also consider the potential of applying the bivariate
tests that depend on the generating function (like the Kocherlakota and
Kocherlakota and Mu~noz and Gamero tests) and the univariate goodness-of-fit
tests (like the Chi-square test) to the pseudo-Poisson data. However, for each
of the tests considered we analyse finite, large and asymptotic properties.
Nevertheless, we compare the power (bivariate classical Poisson and Com-Max
bivariate Poisson as alternatives) of each of the tests suggested and also
include examples of application to real-life data. In a nutshell we are
developing an R package which includes a test for compatibility of the data

thermodynamics. R.C. Tolman initiated a correlation between gravity and
thermodynamics. The development of black hole thermodynamics and the
generalized second law of thermodynamics led to Penrose's conjecture that the
Weyl tensor should serve as a measure of the entropy of the free gravitational
field. This entropy reflects the degrees of freedom associated with the free
gravitational field. The proposition of gravitational entropy justifies the
initial entropy of the universe. This entropy function had to be associated
with the dynamics of the free gravitational field from the time of the big
bang, so that a gravity-dominated evolution of the universe preserves the
second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, the concept of black hole entropy
emerges as a particular case of the entropy of the free gravitational field.
However, a self-consistent notion of gravitational entropy in the context of
cosmological structure formation has eluded us till today. Various proposals
have been put forward, initially based on Penrose's Weyl Curvature Hypothesis,
and subsequently modified to fit the needs of specific geometries and matter
distributions. Such proposals were basically geometric in nature. A few years
back a new definition of gravitational entropy was proposed from the
considerations of the relativistic Gibb's equation and based on the square root
of the Bel-Robinson tensor, the simplest divergence-free tensor derived from
the Weyl tensor. Even this proposal is valid only for a restricted class of
spacetimes. A complete self-consistent description of gravitational entropy
encompassing black hole physics and cosmological dynamics is yet to emerge. In
this article, we gather an overview of the concept of gravitational entropy,
following it up with the development of the various proposals of gravitational
entropy.

the informative sources are known in the oracle sense, in the first step, we
acquire knowledge of the target parameter by pooling the useful source datasets

using the target dataset. In contrast to the existing literatures which exert
homogeneity conditions for Hessian matrices of various population loss
functions, our theoretical analysis shows that even if the Hessian matrices are
heterogeneous, the pooling estimators still provide adequate information by
slightly enlarging regularization, and numerical studies further validate the
assertion. Sparse regression and low-rank trace regression for both linear and
generalized linear cases are discussed as two specific examples under the

classify the scene or sound of an entire audio clip, e.g. audio tagging,
instrument recognition, etc. While frame-level tasks detect event-level
timestamps from an audio clip, e.g. sound event detection, speaker diarization,

Frame-level tasks are important for fine-grained acoustic scene/event
understanding, and are generally more challenging than clip-level tasks. In

accepted by third-party users and developers. However, the open inference APIs
may be utilized by malicious customers to conduct model extraction attacks,
i.e., attackers can replicate a cloud-based black-box model merely via querying
malicious examples. Existing model extraction attacks mainly depend on the
posterior knowledge (i.e., predictions of query samples) from Oracle. Thus,
they either require high query overhead to simulate the decision boundary, or
suffer from generalization errors and overfitting problems due to query budget
limitations. To mitigate it, this work proposes an efficient model extraction
attack based on prior knowledge for the first time. The insight is that prior
knowledge of unlabeled proxy datasets is conducive to the search for the
decision boundary (e.g., informative samples). Specifically, we leverage
self-supervised learning including autoencoder and contrastive learning to
pre-compile the prior knowledge of the proxy dataset into the feature extractor
of the substitute model. Then we adopt entropy to measure and sample the most
informative examples to query the target model. Our design leverages both prior

evidenced by field and laboratory studies. During the passage of seismic waves,
rocks exhibit a decrease in elastic moduli, slowly recovering after.Yet,
comprehensive physical models describing these moduli alterations remain sparse
and insufficiently validated against observations. Here, we demonstrate the
applicability of two physical damage models - the internal variable model (IVM)
and the continuum damage model (CDM) - to provide quantitative descriptions of
nonlinear co-seismic elastic wave propagation observations. We recast the IVM
and CDM models as nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations and
implement 1D and 2D numerical simulations using an arbitrary high-order
discontinuous Galerkin method. We verify the modeling results with
co-propagating acousto-elastic experimental measurements. We find that the IVM
time series of P-wave speed changes correlate slightly better with
observations, while the CDM better explains the peak damage delay relative to
peak strain. Subsequently, we infer the parameters for these nonlinear models
from laboratory experiments using probabilistic Bayesian inversion and 2D
simulations. By adopting the Adaptive Metropolis Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method, we quantify the uncertainties of inferred parameters for both physical
models, investigating their interplay in 70,000 simulations. We find that the
damage variables can trade off with the stress-strain nonlinearity in
discernible ways. We discuss physical interpretations of both damage models and
that our CDM quantitatively captures an observed damage increase with
perturbation frequency. Our results contribute to a more holistic understanding

systems, it is practically relevant to study composite oscillators built up
from basic quantum units that are commonly available and offer high
controllability. Here, we consider a minimal model for a composite oscillator
consisting of two interacting qubits coupled to separate baths, for which we
also propose and analyze an implementation on a circuit quantum electrodynamics
platform. We adopt a `microscopic' and `macroscopic' viewpoint and study the
response of the constituent qubits and of the composite oscillator when one of
the qubits is weakly driven. We find that the phase-locking of the individual
qubits to the external drive is strongly modified by interference effects
arising from their mutual interaction. In particular, we discover a
phase-locking blockade phenomenon at particular coupling strengths.
Furthermore, we find that interactions between the qubits can strongly enhance
or suppress the extent of synchronization of the composite oscillator to the
external drive. Our work demonstrates the potential for assembling complex
quantum synchronizing systems from basic building units, which is of pragmatic
importance for advancing the field of quantum synchronization.

  Out-of-Time-Order Correlators","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"nlin.CD quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-KAM (Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser) systems, when perturbed by weak
time-dependent fields, offer a fast route to the classical chaos through an
abrupt breaking of the invariant phase space tori. However, such behavior is
not ubiquitous but rather contingent on whether the total system is in
resonance. The resonances are usually determined by the ratios of
characteristic frequencies associated with the system and the perturbation.
Under the resonance condition, the classical dynamics are highly susceptible to
variations in the system parameters. In this work, we employ out-of-time-order
correlators (OTOCs) to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-KAM
system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the resonances
and non-resonances is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized
kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model with the kick being the external
time-dependent perturbation. Although the Lyapunov exponent of the KHO at
resonances remains close to zero in the weak perturbative regime, making the
system weakly chaotic in the conventional sense, the classical phase space
undergoes significant structural changes. Motivated by this, we study the OTOCs
when the system is in resonance and contrast the results with the non-resonant
case. At resonances, we observe that the asymptotic dynamics of the OTOCs are
sensitive to these structural changes, where they grow quadratically as opposed
to linear or stagnant growth at non-resonances. On the other hand, our findings
suggest that the short-time dynamics remain relatively more stable to the
variations in the parameter. We will back our results by providing analytical
expressions for the OTOCs for a few special cases. We will then extend our
findings concerning the non-resonant cases to a broad class of KAM systems.

superior performance of graph learning. However, fairness is always ignored
when designing GNNs. As a consequence, biased information in training data can
easily affect vanilla GNNs, causing biased results toward particular
demographic groups (divided by sensitive attributes, such as race and age).
There have been efforts to address the fairness issue. However, existing fair
techniques generally divide the demographic groups by raw sensitive attributes
and assume that are fixed. The biased information correlated with raw sensitive
attributes will run through the training process regardless of the implemented
fair techniques. It is urgent to resolve this problem for training fair GNNs.
To tackle this problem, we propose a brand new framework, FairMigration, which
can dynamically migrate the demographic groups instead of keeping that fixed
with raw sensitive attributes. FairMigration is composed of two training
stages. In the first stage, the GNNs are initially optimized by personalized
self-supervised learning, and the demographic groups are adjusted dynamically.
In the second stage, the new demographic groups are frozen and supervised
learning is carried out under the constraints of new demographic groups and
adversarial training. Extensive experiments reveal that FairMigration balances

  In a recent paper by Peletier, Po\v{z}\'ar and the author, one particular
particle system of this type was studied; that in which $f(x) = \frac1x$ is the
Coulomb force. Global well-posedness of this particle system was shown and a
discrete-to-continuum limit (i.e. $n \to \infty$) to a nonlocal PDE for the
signed particle density was established. Both results rely on innovative use of
techniques in ODE theory and viscosity solutions.
  In the present paper we extend these results to a large class of particle
systems in order to cover many new applications. Motivated by these
applications, we consider the presence of an external force $g$, consider
interaction forces $f$ with a large range of singularities and allow $f$ to
scale with $n$. To handle this class of $f$ we develop several new proof
techniques in addition to those used for the Coulomb force.

These severe delays are caused by the fact that, whenever the maximum capacity

paper is on real-time control of traffic input rates, thereby aiming to prevent
such detrimental capacity drops. To account for the fact that, by the
heterogeneity within and between traffic streams, the available capacity of a
road suffers from randomness, we introduce a stochastic flow model that
describes the impact of traffic input streams on the available road capacities.
Then, exploiting similarities with traffic control of telecommunication
networks, in which the available bandwidth is a stochastic function of the
input rate, and in which the use of effective bandwidths have proven an
effective input rate control framework, we propose a similar traffic rate
control policy based on the concept of effective bandwidths. This policy allows
for increased waiting times at the access boundaries of the network, so as to
limit the probability of large delays within the network. Numerical examples
show that, by applying such a control policy capacity violations are indeed
rare, and that the increased waiting at the boundaries of the network is of
much smaller scale, compared to uncontrolled delays in the network.

Specifically, we propose a Time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) enforced

small datasets and a new reliability measure for OOD samples based on
compliance with the T-symmetry. These can be readily used to construct a new
offline RL algorithm (TSRL) with less conservative policy constraints and a
reliable latent space data augmentation procedure. Based on extensive

outperforms the recent offline RL algorithms in terms of data efficiency and

widespread adoption in production database systems. Recently, a caching
technique called Radix-based additive caching of homomorphic encryption (Rache)
was proposed in SIGMOD'23. The primary objective of this paper is to address
the performance overhead resulting from the expensive randomization process in
Rache. To achieve this, we propose a novel encryption algorithm called $ASEnc$,
which replaces the computationally intensive full scan of radixes with the
caching of a polynomial number of radix-powers during an offline stage. This
design significantly reduces the performance impact caused by randomization.
Furthermore, this paper aims to extend Rache's capabilities to support
floating-point numbers. To accomplish this, we introduce a new encryption
algorithm named $FSEnc$, leveraging efficient constant multiplication available
in state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes. Notably,
$FSEnc$ offers the flexibility to cache the coefficients instead of the radixes
themselves, which may result in a large number of cached ciphertexts. However,
we manage this efficiently by streaming the dynamically cached ciphertexts
through a vector of circular buffers. We demonstrate that both encryption
algorithms guarantee semantic security (IND-CPA). To validate their
performance, we implement both algorithms as loadable functions in MySQL 8.0
and deploy the system prototype on a 96-core server hosted in the Chameleon

the reliability of PCFs by confidence maps. An interesting observation of this
work is that the learned confidence map converges to geometrically coherent and
semantically consistent regions, which facilitates robust coordinate
representation. By delivering the confident coordinates to keypoint/feature

source, which is intractable by using synthetic flares alone. Besides, the
previous flare removal pipeline relies on the manual threshold and blur kernel
settings to extract light sources, which may fail when the light sources are
tiny or not overexposed. To address this issue, we additionally provide the
annotations of light sources in Flare7K++ and propose a new end-to-end pipeline
to preserve the light source while removing lens flares. Our dataset and
pipeline offer a valuable foundation and benchmark for future investigations
into nighttime flare removal studies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Flare7K++ supplements the diversity of existing flare datasets and pushes the
frontier of nighttime flare removal towards real-world scenarios.

observed correlations between effective radius, effective surface intensity and
velocity dispersion, are important tools for understanding how evolution
proceeds. Aims. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that the evolution of the
SSRs back in time is governed by the combination of the virial theorem (VT) and
the relation $L=L'_0 \sigma^{\beta(t)}$, where the parameters $\beta$ and
$L'_0$ vary with time and from galaxy to galaxy. Methods. Using the WINGS
database for the galaxies at redshift $z=0$ and the Illustris-1 and
Illustris-TNG databases of artificial galaxies, for the galaxies up to redshift
$z=4$, we analyse the SSRs back in time and, by means of simple algebraic
expressions for $L'_0$ and $\beta$ (functions of time and other physical
quantities), we derive the expected paths followed by galaxies in the various
SSRs toward the distributions observed at $z=0$. Results. The distribution of
galaxies in the SSRs is ultimately related to the evolution in luminosity and
velocity dispersion that are empirically mirrored by the $L=L'_0
\sigma^{\beta(t)}$ law. Furthermore, the $\beta$ parameter works as a
thermometer of the virialization of a galaxy. This parameter can assume either
positive or negative values, and its absolute value attains high values when
the galaxy is close to the virial condition, while it tends to zero when the
galaxy is far from it. Conclusions. As the SSRs change with time, the method we
are proposing allows us to decipher the temporal evolution of galaxies.

concepts from model-observer theory and our understanding of the human visual
system to propose a Detection task-specific DL-based approach for denoising MPI
SPECT images (DEMIST). The approach, while performing denoising, is designed to
preserve features that are known to impact observer performance on detection
tasks. We objectively evaluated the proposed method on the task of detecting
perfusion defects using a retrospective study with anonymized clinical data in
patients who underwent MPI studies (N = 338). Performance on the task of
detecting perfusion defects was quantified with an anthropomorphic channelized
Hotelling observer. Images denoised with DEMIST yielded significantly improved
detection performance compared to the corresponding low-dose images and images
denoised with a commonly used task-agnostic DL-based denoising method. Similar
results were observed with stratified analysis based on patient sex and defect
type. Additionally, the proposed method significantly improved performance
compared to the low-dose images in terms of the task-agnostic metrics of root
mean squared error and structural similarity index metric. A mathematical
analysis reveals that DEMIST preserves detection-task-specific features while
improving the noise properties, thus resulting in improved observer
performance. The results provide strong evidence for further clinical

(SGD) that drives overly expressive networks to much simpler subnetworks,
thereby dramatically reducing the number of independent parameters, and
improving generalization. To reveal this bias, we identify invariant sets, or
subsets of parameter space that remain unmodified by SGD. We focus on two
classes of invariant sets that correspond to simpler subnetworks and commonly
appear in modern architectures. Our analysis uncovers that SGD exhibits a
property of stochastic attractivity towards these simpler invariant sets. We
establish a sufficient condition for stochastic attractivity based on a
competition between the loss landscape's curvature around the invariant set and
the noise introduced by stochastic gradients. Remarkably, we find that an
increased level of noise strengthens attractivity, leading to the emergence of
attractive invariant sets associated with saddle-points or local maxima of the
train loss. We observe empirically the existence of attractive invariant sets
in trained deep neural networks, implying that SGD dynamics often collapses to
simple subnetworks with either vanishing or redundant neurons. We further
demonstrate how this simplifying process of stochastic collapse benefits
generalization in a linear teacher-student framework. Finally, through this
analysis, we mechanistically explain why early training with large learning
rates for extended periods benefits subsequent generalization.

isolated MXenes and other 2D monolayers such as germanene or MoS$_2$. The
analysis of the evolution of the charge distribution with the size of the LH
shows that, for small systems, it tends to distribute homogeneously between the
two monolayers, whereas for larger systems electrons tend to accumulate in a
region of $\sim$~6 {\AA} around the interface. The work function of the
heterostructure, one crucial parameter in the design of electronic nanodevices,
is found to be lower than that of some conventional 2D LH. Remarkably, all the
heterostructures studied show a very high Curie temperature (between 696 K and
1082 K), high magnetic moments %present in the ferromagnetic ground state, and
high magnetic anisotropy energies. These features make (Ti$_2$C)/(Ta$_2$C)

their three-dimensional structure and for their interactions with drugs, we
also contributed to the field of biomolecular mass spectrometry, both in terms
of fundamental understanding and with new methodological developments. A first
goal was to develop mass spectrometry approaches to detect non-covalent
interactions between antitumor drugs and their DNA target. Twenty years ago,
our attention turned towards specific DNA structures such as the G-quadruplex
(a structure formed by guanine-rich strands). Mass spectrometry allows to
discern which molecules interact with one another by measuring the masses of
the complexes, and quantity the affinities by measuring their abundance. The
most important findings came from unexpected masses. For example, we showed the
formation of higher- or lower-order structures by G-quadruplexes used in
traditional biophysical assays. We can also derive complete thermodynamic and
kinetic description of G-quadruplex folding pathways by measuring cation
binding, one at a time. Getting quantitative information required accounting
for nonspecific adduct formation and for the response factors of the different
molecular forms. But with these caveats in mind, the approach is mature enough
for routine biophysical characterization of nucleic acids. A second goal is to
obtain more detailed structural information on each of the complexes separated
by the mass spectrometer. One such approaches is ion mobility spectrometry, and
even today the challenge lies in the structural interpretation of the
measurements. We showed that, although structures such as G-quadruplexes are
well-preserved in the MS conditions, double helices actually get more compact
in the gas phase. These major rearrangements forced us to challenge comfortable
assumptions. Further work is still needed to generalize how to deduce
structures in solution from ion mobility spectrometry data, and in particular
how to account for the electrospray charging mechanisms and for ion internal
energy effects. These studies also called for complementary approaches to ion
mobility. Recently, we applied isotope exchange labeling mass spectrometry to
characterize nucleic acid structures for the first time, and we reported the
first ever circular dichroism ion spectroscopy measurement on mass-selected
trapped ions. Circular dichroism plays a key role in assigning the stacking
topology, and our new method now opens the door to characterizing a wide
variety of chiral molecule by mass spectrometry. In summary, advanced mass
spectrometry approaches to characterize gas-phase structures work well for
G-quadruplexes because they are stiffened by inner cations. The next objective
will be to generalize these methodologies to a wider range of nucleic acid
structures.

Communication (MC) channel with fully absorbing receiver, which counts
particles absorbed along each symbol interval and resets the counter at every

thus inter-symbol interference (ISI), due to the delayed arrival of molecules.
To reduce complexity, our analysis is based on measuring the channel memory as
an integer number of symbol intervals and on a single-sample memoryless
detector. Thus, in our model the effect of released particles remains effective
for a limited number of symbol intervals. We optimize the detector threshold
for maximizing capacity, approximate as Gaussian the received signal
distribution, and calculate the channel mutual information affected by ISI, in
the case of binary concentration shift keying modulation. To the best of our
knowledge, in literature there are no previous investigations on the achievable
rate in this type of system. Our results demonstrate that, in general, the
optimal input probability distribution achieving the maximum achievable rate
may be not uniform. In particular, when the symbol interval is small (strong
ISI), the maximum achievable rate does not occur with equiprobable transmission
of bits.

compelling answers raise the question whether what is true for $\mathbb{R}^n$

the affirmative in this paper.
  Among other things, we discuss and investigate an analogue of the symplectic
invariance property of the Weyl quantization in the setting of graded groups,
as well as the notion of the Poisson bracket for symbols in the setting of

documents are also an important tool for the central bank to communicate with
the market, they are meticulously elaborated on grammatical syntax and wording,
and investors are urged to read more accurately about the central bank's policy
stance. Sentiment analysis on central bank documents has long been carried out,
but it has been difficult to interpret the meaning of the documents accurately
and to explicitly capture even the intentional change in nuance. This study
attempts to evaluate the implication of the zero-shot text classification
method for an unknown economic environment using the same model. We compare the
tone of the statements, minutes, press conference transcripts of FOMC meetings,
and the Fed officials' (chair, vice chair, and Governors) speeches. In

of changes in each policy stance since 1971.

However, such a pipeline approach not only makes the reader vulnerable to the
errors propagated from the retriever, but also demands additional effort to
develop both the retriever and the reader, which further makes it slower since
they are not runnable in parallel. In this work, we propose a method to
directly predict answers with a phrase retrieval scheme for a sequence of
words, reducing the conventional two distinct subtasks into a single one. Also,
for the first time, we study its capability for ODConvQA tasks. However, simply
adopting it is largely problematic, due to the dependencies between previous
and current turns in a conversation. To address this problem, we further
introduce a novel contrastive learning strategy, making sure to reflect
previous turns when retrieving the phrase for the current context, by
maximizing representational similarities of consecutive turns in a conversation
while minimizing irrelevant conversational contexts. We validate our model on
two ODConvQA datasets, whose experimental results show that it substantially
outperforms the relevant baselines with the retriever-reader. Code is available

long-term radial velocity surveys, but only a few dozen of these planets have a
precise radius measurement. Transiting gas giants are crucial targets for the
study of atmospheric composition across a wide range of equilibrium
temperatures and for shedding light on the formation and evolution of planetary
systems. Indeed, compared to hot Jupiters, the atmospheric properties and
orbital parameters of cooler gas giants are unaltered by intense stellar
irradiation and tidal effects. We identify long-period planets in the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data as duo-transit events. To
solve the orbital periods of TESS duo-transit candidates, we use the
CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) to observe the highest-probability
period aliases in order to discard or confirm a transit event at a given
period. We also collect spectroscopic observations with CORALIE and HARPS in
order to confirm the planetary nature and measure the mass of the candidates.
We report the discovery of a warm transiting Neptune-mass planet orbiting
TOI-5678. After four non-detections corresponding to possible periods, CHEOPS
detected a transit event matching a unique period alias. Joint modeling reveals
that TOI-5678 hosts a 47.73 day period planet. TOI-5678 b has a mass of 20
(+-4) Me and a radius of 4.91 (+-0.08 Re) . Using interior structure modeling,
we find that TOI-5678 b is composed of a low-mass core surrounded by a large
H/He layer with a mass of 3.2 (+1.7, -1.3) Me. TOI-5678 b is part of a growing
sample of well-characterized transiting gas giants receiving moderate amounts
of stellar insolation (11 Se). Precise density measurement gives us insight
into their interior composition, and the objects orbiting bright stars are

for which $g$ generates $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^\times$. By carefully
observing numerical deviations from Artin's originally predicted asymptotic,
Derrick and Emma Lehmer (1957) identified the need for an additional correction
factor; leading to a modified conjecture which was eventually proved to be
correct by Hooley (1967) under the assumption of the generalised Riemann
hypothesis. An appropriate analogue of Artin's primitive root conjecture may
moreover be formulated for an algebraic function field $K$ of $r$ variables
over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Relying on a soon to be established theorem of Weil
(1948), Bilharz (1937) provided a proof in the particular case that $K$ is a
global function field (i.e. $r=1$), which is correct under the assumption that
$g \in K$ is a $\textit{geometric}$ element. Under these same assumptions,
Pappalardi and Shparlinski (1995) established a quantitative version of
Bilharz's result. In this paper we build upon these works by both generalizing
to function fields in $r$ variables over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and removing the
assumption that $g \in K$ is geometric; thereby completing a proof of Artin's
primitive root conjecture for function fields over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. In doing
so, we moreover identify an interesting correction factor which emerges when
$g$ is not geometric. A crucial feature of our work is an exponential sum
estimate over varieties that we derive from Weil's Theorem.

optimization offers great benefits to businesses and other organizations.
Precisely timed process interventions are the cornerstones of effective
optimization. Prescriptive process monitoring (PresPM) is the sub-field of
process mining that concentrates on process optimization. The emerging PresPM
literature identifies state-of-the-art methods, causal inference (CI) and
reinforcement learning (RL), without presenting a quantitative comparison. Most
experiments are carried out using historical data, causing problems with the
accuracy of the methods' evaluations and preempting online RL. Our contribution
consists of experiments on timed process interventions with synthetic data that
renders genuine online RL and the comparison to CI possible, and allows for an
accurate evaluation of the results. Our experiments reveal that RL's policies
outperform those from CI and are more robust at the same time. Indeed, the RL
policies approach perfect policies. Unlike CI, the unaltered online RL approach
can be applied to other, more generic PresPM problems such as next best
activity recommendations. Nonetheless, CI has its merits in settings where
online learning is not an option.

low momenta but form a momentum shell with $f_{\rm B}=1$ on top of a quark

under a modified rainbow ladder truncation, which automatically generates a
quark anomalous magnetic moment term, weighted by a strenght parameter $\xi$.
This term, whose origin is also connected with DCSB, is interpreted as an
additional interaction that mimics the complex dynamics beyond the cutoff. By
fixing $\xi$ to produce the value of $G^{\gamma^* \pi^0 \gamma}(0)$ dictated by
the chiral anomaly, the computed transition form factor, as well as the
interaction radius and neutral pion decay width, turn out to be comparable with

and level-3 simulations, we apply the Jeans Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian
Expansion modelling to tracer stars before and after including binaries to
recover the dynamical masses. The recovered total masses within the half-mass
radius of tracers, $M(<r_\mathrm{half})$, are always inflated due to binary
motions, with greater inflations occurring for smaller $\sigma_{v_r}$. However,
many dwarf galaxies experience central density deflated due to binary motions,
with little dependences on $\sigma_{v_r}$. This is due to the negative radial
gradients in the velocity dispersion profiles, with the fractional inflation in
$\sigma_{v_r}$ due to binaries more significant in outskirts. An extreme binary
fraction of 70% can lead to central density deflation of up to 10-20% at 3
km/s$<\sigma_{v_r}<$8 km/s, with $M(<r_\mathrm{half})$ inflated by 4% at 9 km/s
and up to 15% at 3 km/s. A lower binary fraction of 36% leads to similar
deflations, with the inflations decreasing to approximately 10% at 3 km/s and
becoming statistically insignificant. The choice of binary orbit distribution
models does not result in significant differences, and observational errors
tend to slightly weaken the deflations in the recovered central density. Two
observations separated by one year to exclude binaries lead to almost zero
inflations/deflations for a binary fraction of 36% over 3 km/s$<\sigma_{v_r}<$9
km/s. For $\sigma_{v_r}\sim$1 km/s to 3 km/s, a binary fraction of 70% (36%)

non-collinear k = 0 inverse triangular antiferromagnetic order to a double-$k$
non-coplanar modulated incommensurate magnetic structure below $T_1$ = 280 K,
is primarily driven by the SDW instability. The double-$k$ nature of this
complex low-temperature magnetic order, which can be regarded as an intriguing
superposition of a longitudinal SDW with a modulation wavevector k$_L$ and a
transverse incommensurate helical magnetic order with a modulation wavevector
k$_T$, is unambiguously confirmed by our observation of the inter-modulation
high-order harmonics of the type of 2k$_L$+k$_T$. This discovery not only
solves a long-standing puzzle concerning the nature of the phase transition at
$T_1$, but also provides an extraordinary example on the intrinsic engineering
of correlated many-body phenomena in topological matter. The identified

'bias-unaware', i.e. the estimators are assumed unbiased, or (ii) they rely on
an a priori parametric model for the bias, or (iii) they can infer model biases
that are not unique for the same model and data. First, we design a data
assimilation framework to perform combined state, parameter, and bias

and Vet\H{o} in 2008 as a nearest-neighbor random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ that is
non-Markovian: at each step, the probability to cross a directed edge depends
on the number of previous crossings of this directed edge. T\'oth and Vet\H{o}
found this walk to have a very peculiar behavior, and conjectured that,
denoting the walk by $(X_m)_{m\in\mathbb{N}}$, for any $t \geq 0$ the quantity
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor}$ converges in distribution to a
non-trivial limit when $N$ tends to $+\infty$, but the process
$(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor})_{t \geq 0}$ does not converge in
distribution. In this paper, we prove not only that
$(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}X_{\lfloor Nt \rfloor})_{t \geq 0}$ admits no limit in
distribution in the standard Skorohod topology, but more importantly that the
trajectories of the random walk still satisfy another limit theorem, of a new
kind. Indeed, we show that for $n$ suitably smaller than $N$ and $T_N$ in a
large family of stopping times, the process
$(\frac{1}{n}(X_{T_N+tn^{3/2}}-X_{T_N}))_{t \geq 0}$ admits a non-trivial limit
in distribution. The proof partly relies on combinations of reflected and
absorbed Brownian motions which may be interesting in their own right.

AI-based communications. One of the possibilities offered by semantic
communication is the capability to regenerate, at the destination side, images
or videos semantically equivalent to the transmitted ones, without necessarily
recovering the transmitted sequence of bits. The current solutions still lack
the ability to build complex scenes from the received partial information.
Clearly, there is an unmet need to balance the effectiveness of generation
methods and the complexity of the transmitted information, possibly taking into
account the goal of communication. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by
proposing a novel generative diffusion-guided framework for semantic
communication that leverages the strong abilities of diffusion models in
synthesizing multimedia content while preserving semantic features. We reduce
bandwidth usage by sending highly-compressed semantic information only. Then,
the diffusion model learns to synthesize semantic-consistent scenes through
spatially-adaptive normalizations from such denoised semantic information. We
prove, through an in-depth assessment of multiple scenarios, that our method
outperforms existing solutions in generating high-quality images with preserved
semantic information even in cases where the received content is significantly
degraded. More specifically, our results show that objects, locations, and
depths are still recognizable even in the presence of extremely noisy

massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems is a practical solution
to decrease power consumption. The performance gap between the low and
high-resolution systems is small at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.
However, at high SNR and with high modulation orders, the achievable rate
saturates after a finite SNR value due to the stochastic resonance (SR)
phenomenon. This paper proposes a novel pseudo-random quantization (PRQ) scheme
by modifying the quantization thresholds that can help compensate for the
effects of SR and makes communication with high-order modulation schemes such
as $1024$-QAM in one-bit quantized uplink massive MIMO systems possible.
Moreover, modified linear detectors for non-zero threshold quantization are
derived, and a two-stage uplink detector for single-carrier (SC) multi-user
systems is proposed. The first stage is an iterative method called Boxed Newton
Detector (BND) that utilizes Newton's Method to maximize the log-likelihood
with box constraints. The second stage, Nearest Codeword Detector (NCD),
exploits the first stage solution and creates a small set of most likely
candidates based on sign constraints to increase detection performance. The
proposed two-stage method with PRQ outperforms the state-of-the-art detectors
from the literature with comparable complexity while supporting high-order
modulation schemes.

special and extremely relevant atmospheric states like blockings are associated

is in general densely populated by unstable periodic orbits that can be used to
approximate any forward trajectory through the so-called shadowing. Dynamical
heterogeneity can lead to the presence of unstable periodic orbits with
different number of unstable dimensions. This phenomenon - unstable dimensions
variability - implies a serious breakdown of hyperbolicity and has considerable
implications in terms of the structural stability of the system and of the
possibility to describe accurately its behaviour through numerical models. As a
step in the direction of better understanding the properties of
high-dimensional chaotic systems, we provide here an extensive numerical study
of the dynamical heterogeneity of the Lorenz '96 model in a parametric
configuration leading to chaotic dynamics. We show that the detected
variability in the number of unstable dimensions is associated with the
presence of many finite-time Lyapunov exponents that fluctuate about zero also
when very long averaging times are considered. The transition between regions
of the attractor with different degrees of instability comes with a significant
drop of the quality of the shadowing. By performing a coarse graining based on
the shadowing unstable periodic orbits, we can characterize the slow
fluctuations of the system between regions featuring, on the average,
anomalously high and anomalously low instability. In turn, such regions are
associated, respectively, with states of anomalously high and low energy, thus

through the acquisition of pharmacokinetic parameters. However, traditional
methods for estimating these pharmacokinetic parameters involve fitting tracer
kinetic models, which often suffer from computational complexity and low
accuracy due to noisy arterial input function (AIF) measurements. Although some
deep learning approaches have been proposed to tackle these challenges, most
existing methods rely on supervised learning that requires paired input DCE-MRI
and labeled pharmacokinetic parameter maps. This dependency on labeled data
introduces significant time and resource constraints, as well as potential
noise in the labels, making supervised learning methods often impractical. To
address these limitations, here we present a novel unpaired deep learning
method for estimating both pharmacokinetic parameters and the AIF using a
physics-driven CycleGAN approach. Our proposed CycleGAN framework is designed
based on the underlying physics model, resulting in a simpler architecture with
a single generator and discriminator pair. Crucially, our experimental results
indicate that our method, which does not necessitate separate AIF measurements,
produces more reliable pharmacokinetic parameters than other techniques.

their corresponding cause clauses from a document. Existing approaches tackle
this task through multi-task learning (MTL) framework in which the two subtasks
provide indicative clues for ECPE. However, the previous MTL framework
considers only one round of multi-task reasoning and ignores the reverse
feedbacks from ECPE to the subtasks. Besides, its multi-task reasoning only
relies on semantics-level interactions, which cannot capture the explicit
dependencies, and both the encoder sharing and multi-task hidden states
concatenations can hardly capture the causalities. To solve these issues, we
first put forward a new MTL framework based on Co-evolving Reasoning. It (1)
models the bidirectional feedbacks between ECPE and its subtasks; (2) allows
the three tasks to evolve together and prompt each other recurrently; (3)
integrates prediction-level interactions to capture explicit dependencies. Then
we propose a novel multi-task relational graph (MRG) to sufficiently exploit
the causal relations. Finally, we propose a Co-evolving Graph Reasoning Network
(CGR-Net) that implements our MTL framework and conducts Co-evolving Reasoning
on MRG. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art

deciding where to place sensors and how to orient them -- is an important
problem in MEG instrumentation development. In this paper, we propose a novel
principled approach to the MEG sensor-array optimization problem. We use the
Vector Spherical Harmonics (VSH) formalism to define a figure-of-merit for an
MEG sensor array. We start with an observation that, under certain reasonable
assumptions, any array of $m$ perfectly noiseless sensors will attain exactly
the same performance, regardless of the sensors' locations and orientations
(with the exception of a negligible set of singularly bad sensor
configurations). We proceed to the conclusion that under the aforementioned
assumptions, the only difference between different array configurations is the
effect of (sensor) noise on their performance. We then propose a
figure-of-merit that quantifies, with a single number, how much the sensor
array in question amplifies the sensor noise. With the figure-of-merit defined,
we can formulate the sensor array design problem as a high-dimensional
nonlinear optimization problem, amenable to general-purpose optimization
methods, such as simulated annealing, basin hopping, etc. We demonstrate the
proposed approach by generating optimized sensor arrays that can measure
neuromagnetic fields in the presence of environmental noise more accurately
than typical MEG sensor configurations.

given a graph with weights on the edges and a matroid imposed on the vertices,
our problem is to choose a subset of vertices that is independent in the
matroid, with the objective of maximizing the total weight of covered edges.
This problem is a generalization of the much studied max $k$-vertex cover
problem, in which the matroid is the simple uniform matroid, and it is also a
special case of the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function under
a matroid constraint.
  First, we give a Fixed-Parameter Tractable Approximation Scheme (FPT-AS) when
the given matroid is a partition matroid, a laminar matroid, or a transversal
matroid. Precisely, if $k$ is the rank of the matroid, we obtain $(1 -
\varepsilon)$ approximation using $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ time for
partition and laminar matroids and using $(1/\varepsilon+k)^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$
time for transversal matroids. This extends a result of Manurangsi for uniform
matroids [Manurangsi, 2018]. We also show that these ideas can be applied in
the context of (single-pass) streaming algorithms. Besides, our FPT-AS
introduces a new technique based on matroid union, which may be of independent
interest in extremal combinatorics.
  In the second part, we consider general matroids. We propose a simple local
search algorithm that guarantees $2/3 \approx 0.66$ approximation. For the more
general problem where two matroids are imposed on the vertices and a feasible
solution must be a common independent set, we show that a local search
algorithm gives a $2/3 \cdot (1 - 1/(p+1))$ approximation in $n^{O(p)}$ time,
for any integer $p$. We also provide some evidence to show that with the
constraint of one or two matroids, the approximation ratio of $2/3$ is likely
the best possible, using the currently known techniques of local search.

is proposed to adapt the pre-trained model to continually changing target

which aims to leverage a self-training manner to extract the target domain
knowledge. However, pseudo labels can be noisy and the updated model parameters
are uncertain under dynamic data distributions, leading to error accumulation
and catastrophic forgetting in the continual adaptation process. To tackle
these challenges and maintain the model plasticity, we tactfully design a
Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA, explicitly handling both domain-specific
and domain-agnostic knowledge. Specifically, we first comprehensively explore
the different domain representations of the adapters with trainable high and
low-rank embedding space. Then we inject ViDAs into the pre-trained model,
which leverages high-rank and low-rank prototypes to adapt the current domain
distribution and maintain the continual domain-shared knowledge, respectively.
To adapt to the various distribution shifts of each sample in target domains,
we further propose a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy, which
adaptively merges knowledge from each ViDA with different rank prototypes.
Extensive experiments conducted on four widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that
our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. In addition, our method can be
regarded as a novel transfer paradigm and showcases promising results in
zero-shot adaptation of foundation models to continual downstream tasks and

(APA). To ensure reliable operation, efficient and timely fault diagnosis of
APAs on-site is crucial. To date, fault diagnosis has relied on measurement of
frequency domain radiation patterns using costly equipment and multiple
strictly controlled measurement probes, which are time-consuming, complex, and
therefore infeasible for on-site deployment. This paper proposes a novel method
exploiting a Deep Neural Network (DNN) tailored to extract the features hidden
in the baseband in-phase and quadrature signals for classifying the different
faults. It requires only a single probe in one measurement point for fast and
accurate diagnosis of the faulty elements and components in APAs.
  Validation of the proposed method is done using a commercial 28 GHz APA.
Accuracies of 99% and 80% have been demonstrated for single- and multi-element
failure detection, respectively. Three different test scenarios are
investigated: on-off antenna elements, phase variations, and magnitude
attenuation variations. In a low signal to noise ratio of 4 dB, stable fault
detection accuracy above 90% is maintained. This is all achieved with a
detection time of milliseconds (e.g 6~ms), showing a high potential for on-site
deployment.

From the perspective of on-chip integration and reconfigurability of photonic

compact high-speed microdisk modulator to realize multiple NAFs. The fabricated
microdisk modulator has an add-drop configuration in which a lateral PN
junction is incorporated for tuning. Based on high-speed nonlinear
electrical-optical (E-O) effect, multiple NAFs are realized by electrically
controlling free-carrier injection. Thanks to its strong optical confinement of
the disk cavity, all-optical thermo-optic (TO) nonlinear effect can also be
leveraged to realize other four different NAFs, which is difficult to be
realized with the use of electrical-optical effect. With the use of the
realized nonlinear activation function, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is
studied to perform handwritten digit classification task, and an accuracy as
large as 98% is demonstrated, which verifies the effectiveness of the use of
the high-speed microdisk modulator to realize the NAFs. Thanks to its compact

modulator features multiple NAFs, which could serve as a flexible nonlinear

obtain workers' ability types and distances. A trust-directed graph in the

lack of annotated data. Cross-lingual transfer (CLT) is a way to circumvent
this issue thanks to the ability of multilingual large language models to be
fine-tuned on a specific task in one language and to provide high accuracy for
the same task in another language. However, other methods leveraging
translation models can be used to perform NER without annotated data in the
target language, by either translating the training set or test set. This paper
compares cross-lingual transfer with these two alternative methods, to perform
clinical NER in French and in German without any training data in those
languages. To this end, we release MedNERF a medical NER test set extracted
from French drug prescriptions and annotated with the same guidelines as an
English dataset. Through extensive experiments on this dataset and on a German
medical dataset (Frei and Kramer, 2021), we show that translation-based methods
can achieve similar performance to CLT but require more care in their design.
And while they can take advantage of monolingual clinical language models,
those do not guarantee better results than large general-purpose multilingual

a labeled source domain to improve the performance on an unlabeled target
domain. Prior works typically require the access to the source domain data for
adaptation, and the availability of sufficient data on the target domain.
However, these assumptions may not hold due to data privacy and rare data
collection. In this paper, we propose and investigate a more practical and
challenging domain adaptive object detection problem under both source-free and
few-shot conditions, named as SF-FSDA. To overcome this problem, we develop an
efficient labeled data factory based approach. Without accessing the source
domain, the data factory renders i) infinite amount of synthesized
target-domain like images, under the guidance of the few-shot image samples and
text description from the target domain; ii) corresponding bounding box and
category annotations, only demanding minimum human effort, i.e., a few manually
labeled examples. On the one hand, the synthesized images mitigate the
knowledge insufficiency brought by the few-shot condition. On the other hand,
compared to the popular pseudo-label technique, the generated annotations from
data factory not only get rid of the reliance on the source pretrained object
detection model, but also alleviate the unavoidably pseudo-label noise due to
domain shift and source-free condition. The generated dataset is further
utilized to adapt the source pretrained object detection model, realizing the
robust object detection under SF-FSDA. The experiments on different settings
showcase that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods
on SF-FSDA problem. Our codes and models will be made publicly available.

geometrical and invariant temporal properties of the system in question (like

networks (RNNs) on such systems by gradient-descent based techniques faces
severe challenges. This is mainly due to exploding gradients caused by the
exponential divergence of trajectories in chaotic systems. Moreover, for
(scientific) interpretability we wish to have as low dimensional
reconstructions as possible, preferably in a model which is mathematically
tractable. Here we report that a surprisingly simple modification of teacher
forcing leads to provably strictly all-time bounded gradients in training on
chaotic systems, and, when paired with a simple architectural rearrangement of
a tractable RNN design, piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs), allows for faithful
reconstruction in spaces of at most the dimensionality of the observed system.
We show on several DS that with these amendments we can reconstruct DS better
than current SOTA algorithms, in much lower dimensions. Performance differences
were particularly compelling on real world data with which most other methods
severely struggled. This work thus led to a simple yet powerful DS
reconstruction algorithm which is highly interpretable at the same time.

introduce a denoising diffusion algorithm that uses a set of point clouds
collected from the surface of individual sand grains to generate grains in the
latent space. By employing a point cloud autoencoder, the three-dimensional
point cloud structures of sand grains are first encoded into a
lower-dimensional latent space. A generative denoising diffusion probabilistic
model is trained to produce synthetic sand that maximizes the log-likelihood of
the generated samples belonging to the original data distribution measured by a
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed
method is capable of generating realistic grains with morphology, shapes and
sizes consistent with the training data inferred from an F50 sand database. We
then use a rigid contact dynamic simulator to pour the synthetic sand in a
confined volume to form granular assemblies in a static equilibrium state with
targeted distribution properties. To ensure third-party validation, 50,000
synthetic sand grains and the 1,542 real synchrotron microcomputed tomography

is proved that, if an initial condition $x\mapsto u(x,t=0)$ approaches, rapidly
enough, a critical point $e$ of $V$ to the right end of space, and if, for some
speed $c_0$ greater than the linear spreading speed associated with $e$, the
energy of this initial condition in a frame travelling at the speed $c_0$ is
negative $\unicode{x2013}$ with symbols, \[ \int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{c_0
x}\left(\frac{1}{2} u_x(x,0)^2 + V\bigl(u(x,0)\bigr)- V(e)\right)\, dx < 0 \,,
\] then the corresponding solution invades $e$ at a speed $c$ greater than
$c_0$, and approaches, around the leading edge and as time goes to $+\infty$,
profiles of pushed fronts (in most cases a single one) travelling at the speed
$c$. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of pushed fronts
invading a critical point at a speed greater than its linear spreading speed
follows as a corollary. In the absence of maximum principle, the arguments are
purely variational. The key ingredient is a Poincar\'e inequality showing that,
in frames travelling at speeds exceeding the linear spreading speed, the
variational landscape does not differ much from the case where the invaded
equilibrium $e$ is stable. The proof is notably inspired by ideas and
techniques introduced by Th. Gallay and R. Joly, and subsequently used by C.

with a minimum mass of $0.07 \pm 0.01 M_J$. The mass of HIP54597 b can
maximally increase by 10% - 30%, the minimum mass of HD74698 c is likely equal
to its true mass, and BD-210397 c has a mass of $2.66^{+0.63}_{-0.32} M_J$.
HD62364 hosts a brown dwarf with a true mass of $18.77^{+0.66}_{-0.63} M_J$ in
an orbit of 14 yr. HD56380B, HD221638B, and HD33473C have minimum masses within
the brown dwarf limits, in orbits of 8.9 yr, 16.6 yr, and 50 yr respectively;
however, astrometric measurements reveal them to be stellar binaries, with
masses of $375.3^{+8.6}_{-8.4}$, $110.0^{+3.9}_{-3.7}$, and
$271.0^{+3.9}_{-3.8} M_J$. The orbits of the stellar binaries HD11938 and
HD61383 are incomplete. The preliminary result for HD61383 is a 0.190
$M_{\odot}$ binary in a 39 yr orbit. The secondary of the binary system HD11938
has a mass of 0.33 $M_{\odot}$ - which is confirmed by a secondary peak in the

  June 2023",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Today, data analysis drives the decision-making process in virtually every
human activity. This demands for software platforms that offer simple
programming abstractions to express data analysis tasks and that can execute
them in an efficient and scalable way. State-of-the-art solutions range from
low-level programming primitives, which give control to the developer about
communication and resource usage, but require significant effort to develop and
optimize new algorithms, to high-level platforms that hide most of the
complexities of parallel and distributed processing, but often at the cost of
reduced efficiency.
  To reconcile these requirements, we developed Noir, a novel distributed data
processing platform written in Rust. Noir provides a high-level dataflow
programming model as mainstream data processing systems. It supports static and
streaming data, it enables data transformations, grouping, aggregation,
iterative computations, and time-based analytics, incurring in a low overhead.

  In this paper, we present the programming model and the implementation
details of Noir. We evaluate it under heterogeneous workloads. We compare it
with state-of-the-art solutions for data analysis and high-performance
computing, as well as alternative research products, which offer different
programming abstractions and implementation strategies. Noir programs are
compact and easy to write: developers need not care about low-level concerns
such as resource usage, data serialization, concurrency control, and
communication. Noir consistently presents comparable or better performance than
competing solutions, by a large margin in several scenarios.
  We conclude that Noir offers a good tradeoff between simplicity and
performance, allowing developers to easily express complex data analysis tasks
and achieve high performance and scalability.

substantially improve on tractability results for decision trees, obtaining a
$(6\delta D S)^S \cdot poly$-time algorithm, where $S$ is the number of cuts in
the tree ensemble, $D$ the largest domain size, and $\delta$ is the largest
number of features in which two examples differ. To achieve this, we introduce
the witness-tree technique which also seems promising for practice. Second, we
show that dynamic programming, which has been successful for decision trees,
may also be viable for tree ensembles, providing an $\ell^n \cdot poly$-time

Finally, we compare the number of cuts necessary to classify training data sets

into three parts: (1) a level generator, (2) a balancing agent and, (3) a
reward modeling simulation. By playing the level in a simulation repeatedly,
the balancing agent is rewarded for modifying it towards the same win rates for
all players. To this end, we introduce a novel family of swap-based
representations to increase robustness towards playability. We show that this
approach is capable to teach an agent how to alter a level for balancing better

  group-sequential trials",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP stat.OT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Adaptive designs(AD) are a broad class of trial designs that allow preplanned
modifications based on patient data providing improved efficiency and
flexibility. However, a delay in observing the primary outcome variable can
harm this added efficiency. In this paper, we aim to ascertain the size of such
outcome delay that results in the realised efficiency gains of ADs becoming
negligible compared to classical fixed sample RCTs.
  We measure the impact of delay by developing formulae for the no. of overruns
in 2 arm GSDs with normal data, assuming different recruitment models. The
efficiency of a GSD is usually measured in terms of the expected sample size
(ESS), with GSDs generally reducing the ESS compared to a standard RCT. Our
formulae measures the efficiency gain from a GSD in terms of ESS reduction that
is lost due to delay. We assess whether careful choice of design (e.g.,
altering the spacing of the IAs) can help recover the benefits of GSDs in
presence of delay. We also analyse the efficiency of GSDs with respect to time
to complete the trial.
  Comparing the expected efficiency gains, with and without consideration of
delay, it is evident GSDs suffer considerable losses due to delay. Even a small
delay can have a significant impact on the trial's efficiency. In contrast,
even in the presence of substantial delay, a GSD will have a smaller expected
time to trial completion in comparison to a simple RCT. Although the no. of
stages have little influence on the efficiency losses, the timing of IAs can
impact the efficiency of a GSDs with delay. Particularly, for unequally spaced
IAs, pushing IAs towards latter end of the trial can be harmful for the design
with delay.

when considering the deployment of a smaller student network trained from a

a domain-adaptive deep network based on cross-domain feature discrepancy
optimization. Our method comprises three stages: pre-training, cluster-centroid

Optimization (DRO) technique to deal with the vanishing worst-case training
loss. To enhance the richness of the features, we concatenate three temporal
features with the deep learning features. The cluster computing stage involves
computing centroids of distinctly separable clusters for the source using true
labels, and for the target using confident predictions. We propose a novel
technique to select confident predictions in the target domain. In the
adaptation stage, we minimize compacting loss within the same cluster,
separating loss across different clusters, inter-domain cluster discrepancy
loss, and running combined loss to produce a domain-robust model. Experiments
conducted in both cross-domain and cross-channel paradigms show the efficacy of
the proposed method. Our method achieves superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art approaches in detecting ventricular ectopic beats (V),
supraventricular ectopic beats (S), and fusion beats (F). Our method achieves

candidate actions by exploring possible future states. To simulate future
states when there is a high-dimensional action space, the knowledge of one's
decision making strategy must be used to limit the number of actions to be

self-model. While self-models are implicitly used widely in conjunction with
world models to plan actions, it remains unclear how self-models should be
designed. Inspired by current reinforcement learning approaches and
neuroscience, we explore the benefits and limitations of using a distilled

policy and a distilled policy are used for model-free actions and planned
actions, respectively. Our results on a ecologically relevant, parametric
environment indicate that distilled policy network for self-model stabilizes
training, has faster inference than using model-free policy, promotes better
exploration, and could learn a comprehensive understanding of its own

agreement and propose a respective modeling approach to alleviate this
constraint. Therefore, the Bland-Altman analysis is embedded in the framework
of recursive partitioning to explicitly define subgroups with heterogeneous
agreement in dependence of covariates in an exploratory analysis. Three
different modeling approaches, conditional inference trees with an appropriate
transformation of the modeled differences (CTreeTrafo), distributional
regression trees (DistTree), and model-based trees (MOB) are considered. The
performance of these models is evaluated in terms of type-I error probability
and power in several simulation studies. Further, the adjusted rand index (ARI)
is used to quantify the models' ability to uncover given subgroups. An
application example to real data of accelerometer device measurements is used
to demonstrate the applicability. Additionally, a two-sample Bland-Altman test
is proposed for exploratory or confirmatory hypothesis testing of differences
in agreement between subgroups. Results indicate that all models were able to
detect given subgroups with high accuracy as the sample size increased.
Relevant covariates that may affect agreement could be detected in the
application to accelerometer data. We conclude that conditional method
agreement trees (COAT) enable the exploratory analysis of method agreement in
dependence of covariates and the respective exploratory or confirmatory
hypothesis testing of group differences. It is made publicly available through

discretization of the the source terms inside each control volume in the
development of the well-balanced scheme. Based on the cell-averaged flow

evolution of planets. However, the long-period planets in these systems often
escape detection. HD 22946 is a bright star around which 3 transiting planets
were identified via TESS photometry, but the true orbital period of the
outermost planet d was unknown until now. We aim to use CHEOPS to uncover the
true orbital period of HD 22946d and to refine the orbital and planetary
properties of the system, especially the radii of the planets. We used the
available TESS photometry of HD 22946 and observed several transits of the
planets b, c, and d using CHEOPS. We identified 2 transits of planet d in the
TESS photometry, calculated the most probable period aliases based on these
data, and then scheduled CHEOPS observations. The photometric data were
supplemented with ESPRESSO radial velocity data. Finally, a combined model was
fitted to the entire dataset. We successfully determined the true orbital
period of the planet d to be 47.42489 $\pm$ 0.00011 d, and derived precise
radii of the planets in the system, namely 1.362 $\pm$ 0.040 R$_\oplus$, 2.328
$\pm$ 0.039 R$_\oplus$, and 2.607 $\pm$ 0.060 R$_\oplus$ for planets b, c, and
d, respectively. Due to the low number of radial velocities, we were only able
to determine 3$\sigma$ upper limits for these respective planet masses, which
are 13.71 M$_\oplus$, 9.72 M$_\oplus$, and 26.57 M$_\oplus$. We estimated that
another 48 ESPRESSO radial velocities are needed to measure the predicted
masses of all planets in HD 22946. Planet c appears to be a promising target
for future atmospheric characterisation. We can also conclude that planet d, as
a warm sub-Neptune, is very interesting because there are only a few similar
confirmed exoplanets to date. Such objects are worth investigating in the near
future, for example in terms of their composition and internal structure.

wave (MDCDW) in a dense and magnetized quark matter is studied. This phase is
supposed to exist in the extreme conditions prevailing, e.g., in neutron star
cores. These conditions are, apart from high densities and strong magnetic
fields, a relatively large angular velocity. To answer the question of whether
the rotation enhances or suppresses the formation of this phase, we first
determine the effect of rotation on the energy dispersion relation of a
fermionic system in the presence of a constant magnetic field, and then focus
on the thermodynamic potential of the model at zero temperature and finite
chemical potential. The thermodynamic potential consists, in particular, of an
anomalous part leading to certain topological effects. We show that in
comparison with the nonrotating case, a term proportional to the angular
velocity appears in this anomalous potential. We then solve the corresponding
gap equations to the chiral and spatial modulation condensates, and study the
dependence of these dynamical variables on the chemical potential ($\mu$),
magnetic field ($eB$), and angular velocity ($\Omega$). It turns out that the
interplay between these parameters suppresses the formation of the MDCDW phase
in relevant regimes for neutron stars. This is interpreted as the manifestation
of the inverse magnetorotational catalysis, which is also reflected in the

address these issues, a Focus and Separation Network (FoSp) is proposed. We
first introduce a Focus module employing bidirectional cascade which guides
low-resolution and high-resolution features towards mid-resolution to locate
and determine the scope of smoke, reducing the miss detection rate. Next, we
propose a Separation module that separates smoke images into a pure smoke
foreground and a smoke-free background, enhancing the contrast between smoke

Domain Fusion module is developed to integrate the distinctive features of the
two modules which can balance recall and precision to achieve high F_beta.
Futhermore, to promote the development of ESS, we introduce a high-quality
real-world dataset called SmokeSeg, which contains more small and transparent

the same number of degrees of freedom as GR and, in vacuum, it is
straightforwardly mapped into GR with a cosmological constant. The mapping
between GR and Palatini $f(R)$ inside matter is possible but at the expense of
reinterpreting the meaning of the matter fields. The physical meaning and
consequences of such mapping will depend on the physical context. Here we
consider three such cases within the weak field limit: Solar System dynamics,
planetary internal dynamics (seismology), and galaxies. After revising our
previous results on the Solar System and Earth's seismology, we consider here
the possibility of $f(R)$ Palatini as a dark matter candidate. For any $f(R)$
that admits a polynomial approximation in the weak field limit, we show here,
using SPARC data and a recent method that we proposed, that the theory cannot
be used to replace dark matter in galaxies. We also show that the same result
applies to the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld gravity. Differently from the
metric $f(R)$ case, the rotation curve data are sufficient for this conclusion.

Multi-Relational Nested contract Graph (MRNG) to better characterize the rich
syntactic and semantic information in the smart contract code, including the
relationships between data and instructions. An MRNG represents a smart
contract, where each node represents a function in the smart contract and each
edge describes the calling relationship between the functions. In addition, we
create a Multi-Relational Function Graph (MRFG) for each function, which
characterizes the corresponding function code. That is, each function is
characterized as an MRFG, which corresponds to a node in the MRNG. Each MRFG
uses different types of edges to represent the different control and data
relationships between nodes within a function. We also propose a
Multi-Relational Nested Graph Convolutional Network (MRN-GCN) to process the
MRNG. MRN-GCN first extracts and aggregates features from each MRFG, using the
edge-enhanced graph convolution network and self-attention mechanism. The
extracted feature vector is then assigned to the corresponding node in the MRNG

convolution is used to further extract features from the FCG. Finally, a feed

asymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn
interactions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences.
Under this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and
treat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and
reduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering.
However, in reality, users' preferences are often vague and volatile, with
uncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel scenario called Vague Preference
Multi-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR), which considers users' vague
and volatile preferences in CRS.VPMCR employs a soft estimation mechanism to
assign a non-zero confidence score for all candidate items to be displayed,
naturally avoiding the over-filtering problem. In the VPMCR setting, we
introduce an solution called Adaptive Vague Preference Policy Learning (AVPPL),
which consists of two main components: Uncertainty-aware Soft Estimation (USE)
and Uncertainty-aware Policy Learning (UPL). USE estimates the uncertainty of
users' vague feedback and captures their dynamic preferences using a
choice-based preferences extraction module and a time-aware decaying strategy.
UPL leverages the preference distribution estimated by USE to guide the
conversation and adapt to changes in users' preferences to make recommendations
or ask for attributes.
  Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the
VPMCR scenario, highlighting its potential for practical applications and
improving the overall performance and applicability of CRS in real-world

imperfections in the proxy reward may hinder the training and lead to
suboptimal results; the diversity of objectives in real-world tasks and human
opinions exacerbate the issue. This paper proposes embracing the heterogeneity
of diverse rewards by following a multi-policy strategy. Rather than focusing
on a single a priori reward, we aim for Pareto-optimal generalization across
the entire space of preferences. To this end, we propose rewarded soup, first
specializing multiple networks independently (one for each proxy reward) and
then interpolating their weights linearly. This succeeds empirically because we
show that the weights remain linearly connected when fine-tuned on diverse
rewards from a shared pre-trained initialization. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for text-to-text (summarization, Q&A, helpful

substrates, irradiated these devices with Xe$^{30+}$ ions at a kinetic energy
of 180 keV to deliberately introduce defects and studied the resulting changes

irradiation: While the charge carrier mobility decreases linearly with
increasing ion fluence (up to only 20% of its initial value) the conductivity
actually increases again after an initial drop of around two orders of
magnitude, likely due to the occurence of hopping transport via localized
states. We also find a significantly reduced $n$-doping ($\approx$ 10$^{12}$

hysteresis height increases with increasing ion fluence and enables us to

that realistic bokeh rendering should (i) model depth relations and distinguish

physically accurate Circle of Confusion (CoC). To this end, we present a
Defocus to Focus (D2F) framework to learn realistic bokeh rendering by fusing
defocus priors with the all-in-focus image and by implementing radiance priors
in layered fusion. Since no depth map is provided, we introduce defocus
hallucination to integrate depth by learning to focus. The predicted defocus
map implies the blur amount of bokeh and is used to guide weighted layered
rendering. In layered rendering, we fuse images blurred by different kernels
based on the defocus map. To increase the reality of the bokeh, we adopt
radiance virtualization to simulate scene radiance. The scene radiance used in
weighted layered rendering reassigns weights in the soft disk kernel to produce
the CoC. To ensure the sharpness of in-focus regions, we propose to fuse
upsampled bokeh images and original images. We predict the initial fusion mask
from our defocus map and refine the mask with a deep network. We evaluate our
model on a large-scale bokeh dataset. Extensive experiments show that our
approach is capable of rendering visually pleasing bokeh effects in complex
scenes. In particular, our solution receives the runner-up award in the AIM

In this work, we demonstrated how combining a mean density inversion with a fit
of frequencies separation ratios can efficiently damp the surface effects and
achieve precise and accurate stellar parameters for ten Kepler LEGACY targets,
well within the PLATO mission requirements.
  We applied and compared two modelling approaches, directly fitting the
individual frequencies, or coupling a mean density inversion with a fit of the
ratios, to six synthetic targets with a patched 3D atmosphere from Sonoi et al.
(2015) and ten actual targets from the LEGACY sample. The fit of the individual
frequencies is unsurprisingly very sensitive to surface effects and the stellar
parameters tend to be biased, which constitutes a fundamental limit to both
accuracy and precision. In contrast, coupling a mean density inversion and a
fit of the ratios efficiently damps the surface effects, and allows us to get
both precise and accurate stellar parameters. The average statistical precision
of our selection of LEGACY targets with this second strategy is 1.9% for the
mass, 0.7% for the radius, and 4.1% for the age, well within the PLATO

innovative crystal materials with specific properties. Recently, the problem of
generating crystal materials has received increasing attention, however, it
remains unclear to what extent, or in what way, we can develop generative
models that consider both the periodicity and equivalence geometric of crystal
structures. To alleviate this issue, we propose two unified models that act at
the same time on crystal lattice and atomic positions using periodic
equivariant architectures. Our models are capable to learn any arbitrary
crystal lattice deformation by lowering the total energy to reach thermodynamic
stability. Code and data are available at https://github.com/aklipf/GemsNet.

Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in sectors 4 and 31, revealing two
small transiting planets. The inner planet, HD 15906 b, was detected with an
unambiguous period but the outer planet, HD 15906 c, showed only two transits
separated by $\sim$ 734 days, leading to 36 possible values of its period. We
performed follow-up observations with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite
(CHEOPS) to confirm the true period of HD 15906 c and improve the radius
precision of the two planets. From TESS, CHEOPS and additional ground-based
photometry, we find that HD 15906 b has a radius of 2.24 $\pm$ 0.08 R$_\oplus$
and a period of 10.924709 $\pm$ 0.000032 days, whilst HD 15906 c has a radius
of 2.93$^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ R$_\oplus$ and a period of
21.583298$^{+0.000052}_{-0.000055}$ days. Assuming zero bond albedo and full
day-night heat redistribution, the inner and outer planet have equilibrium
temperatures of 668 $\pm$ 13 K and 532 $\pm$ 10 K, respectively. The HD 15906
system has become one of only six multiplanet systems with two warm ($\lesssim$
700 K) sub-Neptune sized planets transiting a bright star (G $\leq$ 10 mag). It
is an excellent target for detailed characterisation studies to constrain the
composition of sub-Neptune planets and test theories of planet formation and

can directly obtain the correlation between OCT A-lines at any distance, thus
accelerating the NURD correction. We develop an end-to-end stacked
cross-attention network and design three types of optimization constraints. We
compare our method with two traditional feature-based methods and a CNN-based

With the ViCTORIA (Virgo Cluster multi-Telescope Observations in Radio of

the impact of the environment on the evolution of galaxies and the contribution
of AGN to the ICM-heating, from the inner cluster regions out to beyond the
virial radius. We present a survey of the cluster at 120-168 MHz using LOFAR.
We image a 132 deg$^2$ region of the cluster, reaching an order of magnitude
greater sensitivity than existing wide-field radio surveys of this field at
three times higher spatial resolution compared to other low-frequency
observations. We developed a tailored data processing strategy to subtract the
bright central radio galaxy M87 from the data. This allowed us to correct for
the systematic effects due to ionospheric variation as a function of time and

three previously unreported candidates. In addition, we reveal for the first

millimeter wave (mmWave) ultra-reliable low-latency communication systems for
sixth-generation (6G) applications. Currently, there are a few working
prototypes of RISs operating in the mmWave frequency band and all of them are
based on passive reflective elements. However, to fabricate an efficiently
working RIS at mmWave frequencies, it is crucial to take care of the strong
signal attenuation, reflective element losses and undesired radio frequency
(RF) circuit effects. In this paper, we provide measurement campaign results
for an active RIS in the mmWave frequency band as well as its analysis and
system design. The obtained results demonstrate that an active RIS outperforms
a RIS working in passive mode and provides a higher signal-to-noise-ratio
(SNR). The active RIS consists of active reflective elements that amplify the
impinging signal and reflect the signal to the desired beam direction. To
obtain an efficient RIS in terms of power consumption and RIS state switch
time, we design a hexagonal RIS with 37 elements working at 26 GHz. These
elements are designed to work whether in passive state (binary phase shifting)
or in active state (switch OFF or amplifying). We provide a comparison between
the performance of a RIS working in passive and active mode using numerical
simulations and empirical measurements. This comparison reveals that the active
reflective intelligent surface (RIS) provides a received power that is at least
4 dB higher than that of the equivalent passive RIS. These results demonstrate
the strong advantage of using active RISs for future ultra-reliable low-latency
wireless communications.

Scaling these approaches to very long trajectories is a challenge and requires
introducing suitable approximations to make computations feasible. In this

analyses of the famous and highly cited EMO algorithm NSGA-II have emerged,
demonstrating that practical algorithms with thousands of applications can be
rigorously analysed. However, these results only show that NSGA-II has the same
performance guarantees as GSEMO and it is unclear how and when NSGA-II can
outperform GSEMO. We study this question in noisy optimisation and consider a
noise model that adds large amounts of posterior noise to all objectives with
some constant probability $p$ per evaluation. We show that GSEMO fails badly on
every noisy fitness function as it tends to remove large parts of the
population indiscriminately. In contrast, NSGA-II is able to handle the noise
efficiently on \textsc{LeadingOnesTrailingZeroes} when $p<1/2$, as the
algorithm is able to preserve useful search points even in the presence of

orientational order and destabilizes the quiescent isotropic state above a
critical activity value, eventually resulting in spatiotemporal chaotic
dynamics akin to the one observed ubiquitously in the nematic state. Here we
show that tuning substrate friction yields a variety of emergent structures at
intermediate activity, including lattices of flow vortices with associated
regular arrangements of topological defects and a new chiral state where flow
vortices trap pairs of $+1/2$ defect that chase each other tail. The length
scale of these emergent structures is set by the screening length
$l_\eta=\sqrt{\eta/\Gamma}$ of the flow, controlled by the shear viscosity
$\eta$ and the substrate friction $\Gamma$, and can be captured by simple mode
selection of the vortical flows. We demonstrate that the emergence of coherent
structures can be interpreted as a phase separation of vorticity, where
friction pays a role akin to that of birth/death processes in breaking
conservation of the phase separating species and selecting a characteristic
scale for the patterns. Our work shows that friction provides an experimentally

factors intrinsic to patient samples. In fluorescence imaging, these artifacts
stem from variations across experimental batches. The complexity and subtlety
of these artifacts make the enumeration of data domains intractable. Therefore,
augmentation-based methods of domain generalization that require domain
identifiers and manual fine-tuning are inadequate in this setting. To overcome
this challenge, we introduce ContriMix, a domain generalization technique that
learns to generate synthetic images by disentangling and permuting the
biological content (""content"") and technical variations (""attributes"") in
microscopy images. ContriMix does not rely on domain identifiers or handcrafted

properties nor with $\xi_{\textrm{ion}}$. We find a decrease in Ly$\alpha$
escape fractions with redshift, indicative of decreasing sizes of ionized
bubbles around LAEs at high redshifts. We use a range of galaxy properties to

Specifically, the location information of the target is unknown and random,

characterize the sensing performance, we derive the posterior Cram\'er-Rao

scatterers. This model is capable of analyzing the effect of both
deterministically and randomly moving scatterers on channel properties. The
mixture of Von Mises Fisher (VMF) distribution is considered for scatterers
resulting in a more general and practical model. The proposed motion path model
is applied to the clusters of scatterers with the mixture of VMF distribution,
and a closed form formula for calculating space time correlation function
(STCF) is achieved, allowing the study of the behavior of channel correlation
and channel capacity in the time domain with the presence of stationary and
moving scatterers. To obtain numerical results for channel capacity, we
employed Monte Carlo simulation method for channel realization purpose. The
impact of moving scatterers on the performance of polarized MIMO systems is
evaluated using 2 by 2 MIMO configurations with various dual polarizations,
i.e. V/V, V/H, and slanted 45{\deg} polarizations for different signal-to-noise
(SNR) regimes. The proposed motion path model can be applied to study various
dynamic systems with moving objects. The presented process and achieved formula
are general and can be applied to polarized MIMO systems with any arbitrary

function of a stochastic processes which is repeatedly and discretely observed
at fixed, multivariate, synchronous design points and with additional errors.
Similarly to the rates in $L_2$ obtained in Cai and Yuan (2011), for sparse
design a discretization term dominates, while in the dense case the $\sqrt n$
rate can be achieved as if the $n$ processes were continuously observed without
errors. However, our analysis differs in several respects from Cai and Yuan
(2011). First, we do not assume that the paths of the processes are as smooth
as the mean, but still obtain the $\sqrt n$ rate of convergence without
additional logarithmic factors in the dense setting. Second, we show that in
the supremum norm, there is an intermediate regime between the sparse and dense
cases dominated by the contribution of the observation errors. Third, and in
contrast to the analysis in $L_2$, interpolation estimators turn out to be
sub-optimal in $L_\infty$ in the dense setting, which explains their poor
empirical performance. We also obtain a central limit theorem in the supremum
norm and discuss the selection of the bandwidth. Simulations and real data

been regularly applied in the field of tele-communication. Since variations of
frequency with respect to time remains a vital distinction among radio signals

extraction by converting 1-D radio signals into frequency domain. In this
paper, we propose a scheme for Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) using
modern architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), through generating
spectrum images of eleven different modulation types. Additionally, we perform
resolution transformation of spectrograms that results up to 99.61% of
computational load reduction and 8x faster conversion from the received I/Q
data. This proposed AMC is implemented on CPU and GPU, to recognize digital as
well as analogue signal modulation schemes on signals. The performance is
evaluated on existing CNN models including SqueezeNet, Resnet-50,
InceptionResnet-V2, Inception-V3, VGG-16 and Densenet-201. Best results of
91.2% are achieved in presence of AWGN and other noise impairments in the
signals, stating that the transformed spectrogram-based AMC has good
classification accuracy as the spectral features are highly discriminant, and
CNN based models have capability to extract these high-dimensional features.
The spectrograms were created under different SNRs ranging from 5 to 30db with
a step size of 5db to observe the experimental results at various SNR levels.
The proposed methodology is efficient to be applied in wireless communication

AF-GLOSA model is evaluated in comparison to traditional GLOSA and

demonstrate that the AF-GLOSA model performs best in reducing average stop

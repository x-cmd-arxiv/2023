self-regulation of 262 eighth-grade students, employing information and
communication technology (ICT) and web-based self-assessment tools set against
science learning. The data were analyzed using both maximum likelihood and
Bayesian structural equation modeling to unravel the intricate relationships
between self-regulation, self-efficacy, perceptions of ICT, and self-assessment
tools. Our research findings underscored the direct and indirect impacts of
self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and perceived use of technology on
self-regulation. The results revealed the predictive power of self-assessment
tools in determining self-regulation outcomes, underlining the potential of
technology-enhanced self-regulated learning environments. The study posited the
necessity to transcend mere technology incorporation and to emphasize the
inclusion of monitoring strategies explicitly designed to augment
self-regulation. Interestingly, self-efficacy appeared to indirectly influence
self-regulation outcomes through perceived the use of technology rather than
direct influence. Analytically, this research indicated that Bayesian
estimation could offer a more comprehensive insight into structural equation
modeling by more accurately assessing our estimates' uncertainty. This research
substantially contributes to comprehending the influence of technology-enhanced
environments on students' self-regulated learning, stressing the importance of
constructing practical tools explicitly designed to cultivate self-regulation.

tunneling process. The shot noise power is proportional to both the magnitude
of the current and the effective charge of the carrier. Shot-noise spectroscopy
thus enables - in principle - to determine the effective charge q of the charge
carriers that tunnel. This can be used to detect electron pairing in
superconductors: in the normal state, the noise corresponds to single electron
tunneling (q = 1e), while in the paired state, the noise corresponds to q = 2e,
because of Andreev reflections. Here, we use a newly developed amplifier to
reveal that in typical mesoscopic superconducting junctions, the shot noise
does not reflect the signatures of pairing and instead stays at a level
corresponding to q = 1e. We show that transparency can control the shot noise
and this q = 1e is due to the large number of tunneling channels with each
having very low transparency. At such transparencies, the shot noise in the
junction resembles that of a metallic instead of a superconducting tunnel
junction. Our results indicate that in typical mesoscopic superconducting
junctions one should expect q = 1e noise, and lead to design guidelines for
junctions that allow the detection of electron pairing.

evaluate the quality of super-resolution images has become an urgent task.
However, existing blind SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics merely focus
on visual characteristics of super-resolution images, ignoring the available
scale information. In this paper, we reveal that the scale factor has a
statistically significant impact on subjective quality scores of SR images,
indicating that the scale information can be used to guide the task of blind SR
IQA. Motivated by this, we propose a scale guided hypernetwork framework that
evaluates SR image quality in a scale-adaptive manner. Specifically, the blind
SR IQA procedure is divided into three stages, i.e., content perception,
evaluation rule generation, and quality prediction. After content perception, a
hypernetwork generates the evaluation rule used in quality prediction based on
the scale factor of the SR image. We apply the proposed scale guided
hypernetwork framework to existing representative blind IQA metrics, and
experimental results show that the proposed framework not only boosts the
performance of these IQA metrics but also enhances their generalization

corrupted or missing data. Classic examples include decoding, tracking, signal
enhancement and denoising. Since the reconstructed signals are ultimately
viewed by humans, it is desirable to achieve reconstructions that are pleasing
to human perception. Mathematically, perfect perceptual-quality is achieved
when the distribution of restored signals is the same as that of natural
signals, a requirement which has been heavily researched in static estimation
settings (i.e. when a whole signal is processed at once). Here, we study the
problem of optimal causal filtering under a perfect perceptual-quality
constraint, which is a task of fundamentally different nature. Specifically, we
analyze a Gaussian Markov signal observed through a linear noisy
transformation. In the absence of perceptual constraints, the Kalman filter is
known to be optimal in the MSE sense for this setting. Here, we show that
adding the perfect perceptual quality constraint (i.e. the requirement of
temporal consistency), introduces a fundamental dilemma whereby the filter may
have to ""knowingly"" ignore new information revealed by the observations in
order to conform to its past decisions. This often comes at the cost of a
significant increase in the MSE (beyond that encountered in static settings).
Our analysis goes beyond the classic innovation process of the Kalman filter,
and introduces the novel concept of an unutilized information process. Using
this tool, we present a recursive formula for perceptual filters, and
demonstrate the qualitative effects of perfect perceptual-quality estimation on
a video reconstruction problem.

asphericity under compaction, we observe the emergence of local domains having

diagnosis, leading to medical imaging datasets where the modalities and

the training of medical residents, we explore universal medical image
segmentation, whose goal is to learn from diverse medical imaging sources
covering a range of clinical targets, body regions, and image modalities.
Following this paradigm, we propose Hermes, a context prior learning approach
that addresses the challenges related to the heterogeneity on data, modality,

diverse datasets, we demonstrate the appealing merits of the universal paradigm
over the traditional task-specific training paradigm. By leveraging the synergy

inferring a belief over task parameters, using variational inference methods.
Motivated by recent successes of contrastive learning approaches in RL, such as
contrastive predictive coding (CPC), we investigate whether contrastive methods

representations learned by CPC are indeed sufficient for Bayes optimality.
Based on this observation, we propose a simple meta RL algorithm that uses CPC

comparable performance to state-of-the-art in domains with state-based

reconstruction, enabling learning in domains with image-based observations. It
can also be combined with image augmentations for domain randomization and used

over-shadowed in recent years by increasingly more powerful and expressive
models that can ingest internet-scale data. However, in offline learning for
robotics, we simply lack internet scale data, and so high quality datasets are
a necessity. This is especially true in imitation learning (IL), a sample
efficient paradigm for robot learning using expert demonstrations. Policies
learned through IL suffer from state distribution shift at test time due to
compounding errors in action prediction, which leads to unseen states that the
policy cannot recover from. Instead of designing new algorithms to address
distribution shift, an alternative perspective is to develop new ways of
assessing and curating datasets. There is growing evidence that the same IL
algorithms can have substantially different performance across different
datasets. This calls for a formalism for defining metrics of ""data quality""
that can further be leveraged for data curation. In this work, we take the
first step toward formalizing data quality for imitation learning through the
lens of distribution shift: a high quality dataset encourages the policy to
stay in distribution at test time. We propose two fundamental properties that

{\bf 908}, 2021, p. R3; {\bf 933}, 2022, p. A20 -- together referred to as CS
hereafter), we present a self-consistent Reynolds number asymptotics for
wall-normal profiles of variances of streamwise and spanwise velocity
fluctuations as well as root-mean-square pressure, across the entire flow
region of channel and pipe flows and flat-plate boundary layers. It is first
shown that, when normalized by peak values, the Reynolds number dependence and
wall-normal variation of all three profiles can be decoupled, in excellent
agreement with available data, sharing the common inner expansion of the type
$\phi^+(y^+)=f_0(y^+)+f_1(y^+)/Re^{1/4}_\tau$, where $\phi^+$ is one of the
quantities just mentioned, and the functions $f_0$ and $f_1$ depend only on
$y^+$. Here, the superscript $+$ indicates normalization by wall variables.
Secondly, by matching the above inner expansion and the inviscid outer flow
similarity form, a bounded variation
$\phi^+(y^\ast)=\alpha_\phi-\beta_{\phi}y^{\ast{{1}/{4}}}$ is derived beyond
the peak where, for each $\phi^+$, the constants $\alpha_\phi$ and
$\beta_{\phi}$ are independent of $Re_\tau$ and $y^\ast$ ($=y^+/Re_\tau$,
$Re_\tau$ being the Reynolds number based on the friction velocity) -- also in
excellent agreement with simulations and experimental data. One of the
predictions of the analysis is that, for asymptotically high Reynolds numbers,
a finite plateau $\phi^+\approx\alpha_\phi$ appears in the outer region. This
result sheds light on the intriguing issue of the outer shoulder of the
variance of the streamwise velocity fluctuation, which should be bounded by the
asymptotic plateau of about 10.

Simultaneous triggers between detectors from two planes indicate a coincidence
event which is recorded using a data acquisition system from FNAL.
  In order to quantify the systematic uncertainties associated with the
detector, such as energy depositions and angular resolution of the detector
design, a Monte Carlo simulation using Geant4 is being developed. Simulated and
experimental data will drive the development and validation of a reconstruction
algorithm that, upon completion, is expected to predict average overburden and
rock density. Extended detector exposure to muons can be used as a means to
understand changes in the surrounding environment like rock porosity. On the
experimental front, the measured flux data will be used to benchmark

of this technology can open doors for long term non-invasive geological

the resolution to detect microlensing signatures in the shadows. However,
future expansions of EHT including space-based baselines at the Moon and L$_2$,

Generation System Analysis Model is an agent-based model that was developed to

capability to detail the interaction and movement of individual components and
groups, such as rail cars and casks. The SNF inventory from commercial nuclear
reactors is currently in temporary storage at multiple locations spread across
the US. Shipping of SNF from these locations relies on one of three
transportation modes: rail, heavy-haul truck, or barge. Rail is the most
preferred due to the size of the canisters and casks the SNF would be shipped
in. Under some scenarios, a rail route might not be available to a reactor site
or improving the rail infrastructure at shutdown sites might be too
cost-prohibitive for utilities to opt for a direct rail transfer. Under such
scenarios, using a barge or heavy haul truck to de-inventory the site and
transfer the SNF to a nearby intermodal transfer site with adequate rail
infrastructure where the payload could be transferred to a rail car might prove
to be an attractive option. This work presents the various intermodal
transportation options to move SNF from reactor sites to rail cars. Next, the
operational steps in each of these modes to move the SNF from a reactor site
and transfer it to a rail car is explored. The ideology, assumptions, and
future steps are presented.

which not only tackled the unbalancedness of the class-sample distribution of

reference labels of the training samples. This was achieved by proposing a
novel algorithm to find candidate classification labels of the training samples
from their prior probabilities and the currently estimated posteriors on the

the result of casting the generalized Kelly criterion for optimal betting into
a multiclass classification problem. The proposed objective function was the
expected free energy of a prospective active inference and could incorporate
the candidate labels, the original reference labels, and the priors of the
training samples while still being distribution-based. The incorporation of the
priors into the optimization not only helped to tackle errors in the reference

linear acoustic echo canceler which subtracts a loudspeaker echo estimate from
the recorded microphone signal. To obtain precise echo estimates, the
parameters of the echo canceler, i.e., the filter coefficients, need to be
estimated quickly and precisely from the observed loudspeaker and microphone
signals. For this a sophisticated adaptation control is required to deal with
high-power double-talk and rapidly track time-varying acoustic environments
which are often faced with portable devices. In this paper, we address this
problem by end-to-end deep learning. In particular, we suggest to infer the
step-size for a least mean squares frequency-domain adaptive filter update by a
Deep Neural Network (DNN). Two different step-size inference approaches are
investigated. On the one hand broadband approaches, which use a single DNN to
jointly infer step-sizes for all frequency bands, and on the other hand
narrowband methods, which exploit individual DNNs per frequency band. The
discussion of benefits and disadvantages of both approaches leads to a novel
hybrid approach which shows improved echo cancellation while requiring only
small DNN architectures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of different
loss functions, signal feature vectors, and DNN output layer architectures on
the echo cancellation performance from which we obtain valuable insights into
the general design and functionality of DNN-based adaptation control

and solve the set of dynamical equations corresponding to a steady,
axisymmetric, viscous, advective accretion flow using numerical methods. We
study the dynamical and thermodynamical properties of accreting matter in terms
of the input parameters, namely energy ($\varepsilon_0$), angular momentum
($\ell_0$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), and saturation constant ($\Phi_{\rm
s}$) regulating the effect of thermal conduction. We find that $\Phi_{\rm s}$
plays a pivotal role in deciding the transonic properties of the global
accretion solutions. In general, when $\Phi_{\rm s}$ is increased, the critical
point ($r_{\rm c}$) is receded away from the black hole, and flow variables are
altered particularly in the outer part of the disc. To quantify the physically
acceptable range of $\Phi_{\rm s}$, we compare the global transonic solutions
with the self-similar solutions, and observe that the maximum saturation
constant ($\Phi^{\rm max}_{\rm s}$) estimated from the global solutions exceeds
the saturated thermal conduction limit ($\Phi_{\rm sc}$) derived from the
self-similar formalism. Moreover, we calculate the correlation between $\alpha$
and $\Phi^{\rm max}_{\rm s}$ and find ample disagreement between global
solutions and self-similar solutions. Further, using the global flow variables,
we compute the Bernoulli parameter ($Be$) which remains positive all throughout
the disc, although flow becomes loosely unbound for higher $\Phi_{\rm s}$.
Finally, we indicate the relevance of this work in the astrophysical context in
explaining the possibility of massloss/outflows from the unbound disc.

molecules trapped in an optical tweezer array, achieving average radial (axial)
motional occupation as low as $\bar{n}_r=0.27(7)$ ($\bar{n}_z=7.0(10)$).
Notably, we measure a 1D ground state fraction as high as 0.79(4), and a

  three-dimensional fluid flow",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The present article proposes a partitioned Dirichlet-Neumann algorithm, that
allows to address unique challenges arising from a novel mixed-dimensional
coupling of very slender fibers embedded in fluid flow using a regularized
mortar finite element type discretization. Here, the fibers are modeled via
one-dimensional (1D) partial differential equations based on geometrically
exact nonlinear beam theory, while the flow is described by the
three-dimensional (3D) incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The arising
truly mixed-dimensional 1D-3D coupling scheme constitutes a novel numerical
strategy, that naturally necessitates specifically tailored algorithmic
solution schemes to ensure an accurate and efficient computational treatment.
In particular, we present a strongly coupled partitioned solution algorithm
based on a Quasi-Newton method for applications involving fibers with high
slenderness ratios that usually present a challenge with regard to the
well-known added mass effect. The influence of all employed algorithmic and
numerical parameters, namely the applied acceleration technique, the employed
constraint regularization parameter as well as shape functions, on efficiency
and results of the solution procedure is studied through appropriate examples.
Finally, the convergence of the two-way coupled mixed-dimensional problem
solution under uniform mesh refinement is demonstrated, and the method's
capabilities in capturing flow phenomena at large geometric scale separation is
illustrated by the example of a submersed vegetation canopy.

estimates each student's evolving knowledge states from their learning history
and a controlled text generation model that generates exercise sentences based
on the student's current estimated knowledge state and instructor requirements
of desired properties (e.g., domain knowledge and difficulty). We train and
evaluate our model on real-world learner interaction data from Duolingo and
demonstrate that LMs guided by student states can generate superior exercises.
Then, we discuss the potential use of our model in educational applications

developed to optimize the topology of neural networks (NN) with the joint

latency predictors have been used in NAS with great success, achieving high
sample efficiency and accurate modeling of hardware (HW) device latency

new NAS search space or NN task, and a new latency predictor needs to be
additionally trained for every new HW device. In this paper, we explore methods
to enable multi-task, multi-search-space, and multi-HW adaptation of accuracy

search-space independent NN encoding based on zero-cost proxies that achieves
sample-efficient prediction on multiple tasks and NAS search spaces, improving
the end-to-end sample efficiency of latency and accuracy predictors by over an
order of magnitude in multiple scenarios. For example, our NN encoding enables
multi-search-space transfer of latency predictors from NASBench-201 to FBNet

the GOODS-S field. We show how SEDz* assembles an SED to match observations,
from component stellar-population templates, graphing the contribution of each
by epoch to confirm the robustness of the technique. Very good SED fits for
most SFHs demonstrates the compatibility of our templates with generations of
stars in these first galaxies, even though they are derived from present-epoch
stars in our Galaxy -- as expected, because the light is dominated by
main-sequence A-stars, free of post-main-sequence complexity and insensitive to
heavy-element compositions. We confirm earlier results in Dressler+2023: (1)
Four types of star formation histories (SFHs) -- burst, stochastic, 3-epoch
`contiguous,' and longer `continuous' -- cover the variety of histories: (2)
Starbursts - both single and multiple -- play the lead role in this critical
period of cosmic history, even though less common, longer SFHs (0.5-1.0 Gyr)
produce comparable stellar mass. This buildup of stellar mass amounts to 10^8
to 10^9 Msun in an integer epoch, whether in a ~100 Myr burst or as part of a
longer history. We suggest that the absence of rising SFHs could be explained
by an intense dust-enshrouded phase lasting tens of Myr that precedes their
dust-free SFHs. With comparable contributions to the stellar mass by the four
different SFH types, the stellar mass of these ~1000 galaxies amounts to ~2
x10^12 Msun by z = 6. We find no strong dependencies of the different SFH types
with the large-scale environment. However, the discovery of a compact group of
16 galaxies, 9 of which had first star formation at z=11-12, suggests that long
SFHs are much more common in rare, dense environments, likely destined for the
most populated places of the modern universe.

star formation histories (SFHs) of a sample of 200 galaxies at 0.6$<$z$<$11 and
spanning stellar masses from $\rm 10^6$ to $\rm 10^{9.5}~M_\odot$. We find that
galaxies at high-redshift, galaxies above the Main Sequence (MS) and low-mass
galaxies tend to host younger stellar populations than their low-redshift,
massive, and below the MS counterparts. Interestingly, the correlation between
age, M$_*$ and SFR existed even earlier than Cosmic Noon, out to the earliest
cosmic epochs. However, these trends have a large scatter. Indeed, there are
examples of young stellar populations also below the MS, indicating recent
(bursty) star formation in evolved systems. We explore further the burstiness
of the SFHs by using the ratio between SFR averaged over the last 10 Myr and
averaged between 10 Myr and 100 Myr before the epoch of observation
($\mathrm{SFR_{cont, 10}/SFR_{cont, 90}}$). We find that high-redshift and
low-mass galaxies have particularly bursty SFHs, while more massive and
lower-redshift systems evolve more steadily. We also present the discovery of
another (mini-)quenched galaxy at z = 4.4 (in addition to the one at z=7.3

consequence of the extremely bursty evolution. Finally, we also find a steady
decline of dust reddening of the stellar population approaching the earliest
cosmic epochs, although some dust reddening is still observed in some of the

ionizing photons from young massive stars in star forming galaxies, but its
ability to be resonantly scattered by neutral gas complicates its
interpretation. For reionization era galaxies, a neutral intergalactic medium
(IGM) will scatter Ly-alpha from the line of sight, making Ly-alpha a useful
probe of the neutral fraction at z>6. Here, we explore Ly-alpha in JWST/NIRSpec
spectra from the ongoing GTO program JADES, which targets hundreds of galaxies
in the well-studied GOODS-S and GOODS-N fields. These sources are UV-faint
(-20.4<MUV<-16.4), and thus represent a poorly-explored class of galaxies. The
low spectral resolution (R~100) spectra of a subset of 93 galaxies in GOODS-S
with z_spec>5.5 (as derived with optical lines) are fit with line and continuum
models, in order to search for significant line emission. Through exploration
of the R100 data, we find evidence for Ly-alpha in 15 sources. Additional
analysis of the R1000 data from the same set of galaxies results in five
additional detections. This sample allows us to place observational constraints
on the fraction of galaxies with Ly-alpha emission in the redshift range
5.5<z<7.5, with a decrease from z=6 to z=7. We also find a positive correlation
between Ly-alpha equivalent width and MUV, as seen in other samples. These
results are used to estimate the neutral gas fraction at z~7, agreeing with
previous results (XHI~0.5-0.9).

Initially,~$M$ particles are placed on a vertex of $G$. At the beginning of

The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one

  Cooper et al. showed that when the underlying graph is the complete graph

$M = n/2$. They showed that if $M<(1-\varepsilon)n/2$ for some fixed

different techniques. The correlation functions $C_{nd}$ and $C_{pd}$ are
calculated based on scattering wave function, extending previous benchmarks for
the $Nd$ scattering matrix to this new observable. We use hyperspherical
harmonics and Faddeev techniques with one of the widely used nucleon-nucleon
($NN$) interactions, the Argonne $v_{18}$ potential. Moreover, in the
low-energy region we perform additional calculations in the framework of
pionless effective field theory. The $pd$ correlation function is computed in
the large-energy region to make contact with a recent measurement by the ALICE

different $NN$ and three-nucleon potentials are evaluated with the conclusion
that variations of around $2\%$ are observed. Although these effects are small,
future measurements can go beyond this accuracy allowing for new detailed
studies of strong interaction in light nuclear systems. The present study
supports the current efforts devoted to the measurement of correlation
functions in systems dominated by the strong interactions, such as $pd$, $ppp$,

outcome of an individual in social networks. While prominent methods for
estimating contagion effects in observational studies often assume that there
are no unmeasured confounders, contagion can be confounded due to latent
homophily: nodes in a homophilous network tend to have ties to peers with
similar attributes and can behave similarly without influencing one another.
One way to account for latent homophily is by considering proxies for the
unobserved confounders. However, in the presence of high-dimensional proxies,
proxy-based methods can lead to substantially biased estimation of contagion
effects, as we demonstrate in this paper. To tackle this issue, we introduce
the novel Proximal Embeddings (ProEmb), a framework which integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and adversarial networks to generate balanced
low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional proxies for different
treatment groups and identifies contagion effects in the presence of unobserved
network confounders. We empirically show that our method significantly
increases the accuracy of contagion effect estimation in observational network

people to engage in such interactive environments to conveniently create and
share content with the public. Among them, text data (e.g., tweets, blogs)
maintains the basic yet important social activities and generates a rich source
of user-oriented information. While those explicit sensitive user data like
credentials has been significantly protected by all means, personal private
attribute (e.g., age, gender, location) disclosure due to inference attacks is
somehow challenging to avoid, especially when powerful natural language
processing (NLP) techniques have been effectively deployed to automate
attribute inferences from implicit text data. This puts users' attribute
privacy at risk. To address this challenge, in this paper, we leverage the
inherent vulnerability of machine learning to adversarial attacks, and design a
novel text-space Adversarial attack for Social Good, called Adv4SG. In other
words, we cast the problem of protecting personal attribute privacy as an
adversarial attack formulation problem over the social media text data to
defend against NLP-based attribute inference attacks. More specifically, Adv4SG
proceeds with a sequence of word perturbations under given constraints such
that the probed attribute cannot be identified correctly. Different from the
prior works, we advance Adv4SG by considering social media property, and
introducing cost-effective mechanisms to expedite attribute obfuscation over
text data under the black-box setting. Extensive experiments on real-world
social media datasets have demonstrated that our method can effectively degrade
the inference accuracy with less computational cost over different attribute
settings, which substantially helps mitigate the impacts of inference attacks
and thus achieve high performance in user attribute privacy protection.

workers to determine the mass-inflow rate onto 20 high-redshift (z) and 80
Palomar-Green quasars. Based on several assumptions, it inexplicably implies
that the inflow rate is an inverse function of black-hole (BH) mass Mbh.
Moreover, its results remain untested. This paper offers a simple empirical
relation essentially free of assumptions, found using available data for 59
highest-z quasars and the so-called Salpeter relation. We find that the
accretion rate is proportional to Mbh(1+z)3, consistent with conventional
astrophysics that the accretion rate is a direct function of both Mbh and the
ambient gas density. We apply it to the 20 high-z and a subset of Palomar-Green
quasars. Comparative analyses show that all empirically derived accretion rates
and radiative efficiencies pass the tests, but their theoretical counterparts
fail in most cases. A secondary relation defines the Eddington ratio as a
function of z and radiative efficiency. Consistent with the empirical
relations, spline regression analysis of Kozlowski's data for 132,000 quasars
at z<2.4 shows that both the Eddington ratio and radiative efficiency are
functions of Mbh and z. The results show that bigger BHs accrete more
efficiently the smaller ones. For BHs > a billion solar masses, we get
radiative efficiency of ~0.23 at z>5.7 and ~0.84 at z<0.005. Notably, the
empirical relations predict a mass-inflow rate of 0.11-0,21 solar mass/year on

however, such manual practices do not suit anymore, making it increasingly hard
for data controllers to achieve regulatory compliance. To allow for proper

examine the specific challenges arising in determining the details of personal

also demonstrate how these components can be integrated with each other to

Furthermore, our experimental evaluation indicates reasonable overheads. On

(DPP) inference to enhance multi-source data diversification under limited
communication bandwidth. DPP is a popular probabilistic approach that improves
data diversity by enforcing the repulsion of elements in the selected subsets.
The well-studied Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference in DPP aims to identify
the subset with the highest diversity quantified by DPP. However, this approach
is limited by the presumption that all data samples are available at one point,
which hinders its applicability to real-world applications such as traffic
datasets where data samples are distributed across sources and communication
between them is band-limited.
  Inspired by the techniques used in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO)
communication systems, we propose a strategy for performing MAP inference among
distributed sources. Specifically, we show that a lower bound of the
diversity-maximized distributed sample selection problem can be treated as a
power allocation problem in MIMO systems. A determinant-preserved sparse
representation of selected samples is used to perform sample precoding in local
sources to be processed by DPP. Our method does not require raw data exchange
among sources, but rather a band-limited feedback channel to send lightweight
diversity measures, analogous to the CSI message in MIMO systems, from the
center to data sources. The experiments show that our scalable approach can
outperform baseline methods, including random selection, uninformed individual
DPP with no feedback, and DPP with SVD-based feedback, in both i.i.d and
non-i.i.d setups. Specifically, it achieves 1 to 6 log-difference diversity
gain in the latent representation of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, StanfordCars, and
GTSRB datasets.

separate the density of states into, fast and slow oscillations, which
determine the corresponding fast and slow parts of the magneto-oscillations. We
introduce an efficient scheme of partial diagonalization of our Hamiltonian,

efficient method for fitting numerically the SdH data, using the inherent

not necessarily prevent speciation; on the contrary, they have been suggested
as a driving force for diversification. Here we present a study on a two-island
neutral speciation model in scenarios with intermittent migration driven by
sea-level fluctuations. Mating is constrained to genetically compatible
individuals inhabiting the same island, and offspring inherit nuclear genomes
from both parents with recombination. We observe pulses of speciation that
would not occur in strict isolation or continuous migration. According to the
seabed height, which modulates the duration of the isolation and connection
periods, the maximum richness occurs at different times and in an ephemeral
fashion. The expansion-contraction dynamics can accelerate diversification, but
a long time in isolation can reduce the richness to one species per island,
resembling patterns described by the taxon pulse hypothesis of diversification.
Together with other studies, our results support the relevance of research on
the impact of variable migration on diversification, suggested to be related to

perform nearly all valuable tasks at human cost or less - which we will call
transformative AGI is a much higher bar than merely massive progress in AI, or
even the unambiguous attainment of expensive superhuman AGI or cheap but uneven

  Many steps are needed: The probability of transformative AGI by 2043 can be
decomposed as the joint probability of a number of necessary steps, which we
group into categories of software, hardware, and sociopolitical factors.
  No step is guaranteed: For each step, we estimate a probability of success by
2043, conditional on prior steps being achieved. Many steps are quite
constrained by the short timeline, and our estimates range from 16% to 95%.
  Therefore, the odds are low: Multiplying the cascading conditional
probabilities together, we estimate that transformative AGI by 2043 is 0.4%
likely. Reaching >10% seems to require probabilities that feel unreasonably
high, and even 3% seems unlikely.
  Thoughtfully applying the cascading conditional probability approach to this

helps enumerate the many future scenarios where humanity makes partial but

collocation solvers locally on the subdomains. These ideas are naturally
combined in the presented method since the singly diagonal coefficient in
ESDIRK and a fixed time-step ensures that the coefficient matrix in the

precomputed inverse can be efficiently reused, leading to a scheme with
complexity (in two dimensions) $\mathcal{O}(N^{1.5})$ for the precomputation

proportion of radiative energy converted into electrical energy. A common
method to significantly enhance POD is maintaining a sub-micron vacuum gap
between the emitter and PV cell to leverage the near-field thermal radiation.
On the other hand, bifacial TPV conversion, operating in the far-field regime,
has been proposed to enhance CE by efficiently recycling the sub-bandgap energy
radiation. However, bifacial TPV converters face a challenge in cooling the PV
cell because the excess heat should be transferred in the lateral direction to
side-edge cooling channels. Therefore, careful thermal engineering and
management are required when employing near-field thermal radiation effects on
bifacial TPV converters. In this study, we propose a bifacial near-field TPV

to enhance both POD and CE. Si layers cover both sides of the PV cell to play a

leverages the log-Euclidean distance metrics from the Riemannian manifold,
effectively addressing the swelling effect and arbitrarily incorrect label

developed for describing the electromagnetism of multi-slow-moving-media that
may move with acceleration following complex trajectories.The approach starts
from the integral forms of the four physics laws,and is different from the
classical approach of using Lorentz transformation for correlating the
electromagnetic phenomena observed in two inertia reference frames that have a
relative motion. The governing equations inside the moving object/medium are
the MEs-f-MDMS,and those in vacuum are the classical Maxwell's equations;the
full solutions of both meet at the medium surface/interface and satisfy the
boundary conditions. This paper reviews the background, physical principle,and
mathematical derivations for formulating the MEs-f-MDMS. Strategies are also
presented for mathematically solving the MEs-f-MDMS. The unique advances made
by the MEs-f-MDMS have been systematically summarized and their potential
applications in engineering are elaborated. We found that the Lorentz
transformation is perfect for treating the electromagnetic phenomena of moving
point charges in vacuum;but for moving objects,the covariance of the Maxwell's

velocity is low. Finally,recent advances for treating the boundary conditions

detailed study of polarization behaviour of these pulsars have been carried
out. We were able to fit the rotating vector model to the polarization position
angle sweeps in 68 pulsars, and in 34 pulsars the emission heights could be
measured. In all cases the radio emission was constrained to arise below 10\%
of the light cylinder radius. In pulsars with low spindown energy loss,
$\dot{E}<10^{34}$ ergs s$^{-1}$, we found the mean fractional linear
polarization of the individual times samples in single pulses to be around 0.57
(57\%) which is significantly larger than the fractional linear polarization of
0.29 (29\%) obtained from the average profiles. On the other hand the mean
fractional circular polarization of the individual time samples in single
pulses is around 0.08 (8\%), similar to the measurements from the average
profiles. To explain the observed polarization features, we invoke the
partially screened vacuum gap model of pulsars, where dense spark associated
plasma clouds exist with high pair plasma multiplicity, with significant
decrease of density in the regions between the clouds, that are dominated by
iron ions. The coherent radio emission is excited by curvature radiation from
charge bunches in these dense plasma clouds and escape as linearly polarized
waves near cloud boundaries. We suggest that the circular polarization arises
due to propagation of waves in the low pair multiplicity, ion dominated
inter-cloud regions.

symmetries we present a formulation of the Jacobi- Gordon field theory that
will manifest the strong/weak coupling duality at classical level; for certain
continuous limits for the elliptic modulus the model will reduce to the
standard sin/sinh Gordon field theories, for which such a strong/weak duality
is known only at the level of the S-matrix. It is shown that the so called
self-dual point for the standard sin/sinh Gordon field theory that divides the
strong and the weak coupling regimes, corresponds only to one point of a set of
fixed points under the duality transformations for the elliptic functions. The
potentials constructed in terms of elliptic functions have a critical behavior
near that self-dual point, showing a change of topology; in the weak coupling
regime the vacuum topology implies that there exists the possibility of
formation of topological defects, and in the strong regime coupling there no
exists the possibility of formation of those defects. Furthermore, the
equations of motion can be solved in exact form in terms of the inverse
elliptic functions; in a case the kink-like solitons asso\-cia\-ted with the
maxima of the potential can decay to cusp-like solitons associated with the
minima. The polynomial expansions of the generalized models show a critical
behavior at certain self-dual points; such points define the regions where the
spontaneous symmetry breaking scenarios are po\-ssi\-ble. By invoking the
duality symmetries for the elliptic functions, an explicit relation between the

training data. When the data are not already available, it is tedious and
costly to obtain them. Data markets help with identifying valuable training
data: model consumers pay to train a model, the market uses that budget to
identify data and train the model (the budget allocation problem), and finally
the market compensates data providers according to their data contribution
(revenue allocation problem). For example, a bank could pay the data market to
access data from other financial institutions to train a fraud detection model.
Compensating data contributors requires understanding data's contribution to
the model; recent efforts to solve this revenue allocation problem based on the
Shapley value are inefficient to lead to practical data markets.
  In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm to solve budget allocation and
revenue allocation problems simultaneously in linear time. The new algorithm
employs an adaptive sampling process that selects data from those providers who
are contributing the most to the model. Better data means that the algorithm
accesses those providers more often, and more frequent accesses corresponds to
higher compensation. Furthermore, the algorithm can be deployed in both
centralized and federated scenarios, boosting its applicability. We provide
theoretical guarantees for the algorithm that show the budget is used
efficiently and the properties of revenue allocation are similar to Shapley's.
Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation to show the performance of the
algorithm in practical scenarios and when compared to other baselines. Overall,
we believe that the new algorithm paves the way for the implementation of
practical data markets.

Ensuring the robustness of deep models against these domain shifts is crucial

approach called Fourier Test-time Adaptation (FTTA), which employs a
dual-adaptation design to integrate input and model tuning, thereby jointly
improving the model robustness. The main idea of FTTA is to build a reliable
multi-level consistency measurement of paired inputs for achieving
self-correction of prediction. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we
encourage consistency in global features and local attention maps between the
two transformed images of the same input. Here, the transformation refers to
Fourier-based input adaptation, which can transfer one unseen image into source
style to reduce the domain gap. Furthermore, we leverage style-interpolated
images to enhance the global and local features with learnable parameters,
which can smooth the consistency measurement and accelerate convergence.
Second, we introduce a regularization technique that utilizes style
interpolation consistency in the frequency space to encourage self-consistency
in the logit space of the model output. This regularization provides strong
self-supervised signals for robustness enhancement. FTTA was extensively
validated on three large classification datasets with different modalities and
organs. Experimental results show that FTTA is general and outperforms other

adjust the polarity of the vortices and thus modulate the direction of the

modulate the magnitude of the output current. Further numerical simulation
suggests how the flux inside the superconducting tape is controlled by
different applied fields. We build a controlled flux flow model to correctly

spectral index $D_n4000$. We use the Blooming Tree algorithm to identify the
substructures of the cluster and separate the galaxy sample into substructure
galaxies, halo galaxies and outskirt galaxies. The substructure and halo
galaxies are cluster members, whereas the outskirt galaxies are only weakly
gravitationally bound to the cluster. For the cluster members, the star
formation rate per stellar mass decreases with decreasing distance $R$ from the
cluster center. Similarly, the spectral index $D_n4000$ increases with $R$,
indicating an increasingly average age of the stellar population in galaxies
closer to the cluster center. In addition, star formation in substructure
galaxies is generally more active than in halo galaxies and less active than in
outskirt galaxies, proving that substructures tend to slow down the transition
between field galaxies and cluster galaxies. We finally show that most actively

designed to provide search or recommendation lists to the users, and one can
design different models to implement the recommender. All the users take

multiple turns. A query is strongly dependent on the conversation context. An
effective way to improve retrieval effectiveness is to expand the current query
with historical queries. However, not all the previous queries are related to,
and useful for expanding the current query. In this paper, we propose a new
method to select relevant historical queries that are useful for the current
query. To cope with the lack of labeled training data, we use a pseudo-labeling
approach to annotate useful historical queries based on their impact on the
retrieval results. The pseudo-labeled data are used to train a selection model.
We further propose a multi-task learning framework to jointly train the
selector and the retriever during fine-tuning, allowing us to mitigate the
possible inconsistency between the pseudo labels and the changed retriever.
Extensive experiments on four conversational search datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and broad applicability of our method compared with several

particular, critical commentaries~\cite{angelini2023modern}
and~\cite{boettcher2023inability} point out that simple greedy algorithm
performs better than GNN in the setting of random graphs, and in fact stronger
algorithmic performance can be reached with more sophisticated methods. A

Rather in this note we establish a fundamental limitation for running GNN on
random graphs considered in these references, for a broad range of choices of
GNN architecture. These limitations arise from the presence of the Overlap Gap
Property (OGP) phase transition, which is a barrier for many algorithms, both
classical and quantum. As we demonstrate in this paper, it is also a barrier to
GNN due to its local structure. We note that at the same time known algorithms
ranging from simple greedy algorithms to more sophisticated algorithms based on
message passing, provide best results for these problems \emph{up to} the OGP
phase transition. This leaves very little space for GNN to outperform the known
algorithms, and based on this we side with the conclusions made

scarcity of the target task samples, representation learning based on

However, up until now, most existing works design a source task selection
strategy from a purely empirical perspective. Recently, \citet{chen2022active}
gave the first active multi-task representation learning (A-MTRL) algorithm
which adaptively samples from source tasks and can provably reduce the total
sample complexity using the L2-regularized-target-source-relevance parameter
$\nu^2$. But their work is theoretically suboptimal in terms of total source
sample complexity and is less practical in some real-world scenarios where
sparse training source task selection is desired. In this paper, we address
both issues. Specifically, we show the strict dominance of the
L1-regularized-relevance-based ($\nu^1$-based) strategy by giving a lower bound
for the $\nu^2$-based strategy. When $\nu^1$ is unknown, we propose a practical
algorithm that uses the LASSO program to estimate $\nu^1$. Our algorithm
successfully recovers the optimal result in the known case. In addition to our
sample complexity results, we also characterize the potential of our
$\nu^1$-based strategy in sample-cost-sensitive settings. Finally, we provide

The model was separately tested on a daily basis case to predict the statuses
over time and after 15 days of the beginning of the spread, which resulted in
0.98 AUC at day 16 and remained above 0.80 AUC until day 128. Therefore,
although dealing with sparse tests remains unsolved, the results open the

massive 2D data. A fundamental challenge is to address the 2D-3D domain gap.
This paper proposes a novel approach to point-cloud pre-training that enables
learning 3D representations by leveraging pre-trained 2D-based networks. In
particular, it avoids overfitting to 2D representations and potentially
discarding critical 3D features for 3D recognition tasks. The key to our
approach is a novel multi-view representation, which learns a shared 3D feature
volume consistent with deep features extracted from multiple 2D camera views.
The 2D deep features are regularized using pre-trained 2D networks through the
2D knowledge transfer loss. To prevent the resulting 3D feature representations
from discarding 3D signals, we introduce the multi-view consistency loss that
forces the projected 2D feature representations to capture pixel-wise
correspondences across different views. Such correspondences induce 3D geometry
and effectively retain 3D features in the projected 2D features. Experimental
results demonstrate that our pre-trained model can be successfully transferred
to various downstream tasks, including 3D detection and semantic segmentation,

deferring LSH analysis to a centralized host is (i) slow if the device cluster
is large and (ii) requires access to input data which is forbidden in a
federated context. Using a new family of hash functions, we develop one of the
first private, personalized, and memory-efficient on-device LSH frameworks. Our
framework enables privacy and personalization by allowing each device to
generate hash tables, without the help of a central host, using device-specific
hashing hyper-parameters (e.g. number of hash tables or hash length). Hash
tables are generated with a compressed set of the full weights, and can be
serially generated and discarded if the process is memory-intensive. This
allows devices to avoid maintaining (i) the fully-sized model and (ii) large
amounts of hash tables in local memory for LSH analysis. We prove several
statistical and sensitivity properties of our hash functions, and
experimentally demonstrate that our framework is competitive in training
large-scale recommender networks compared to other LSH frameworks which assume

the spin of an atom or a molecule and then measuring the spin precession

to the polarization of this radiation. We show how systematic errors can arise
when both the polarization of the radiation and the magnitude of the electric

communication networks or computing systems, have a countably infinite
state-space. Algorithmic and learning procedures that have been developed to
produce optimal policies mainly focus on finite state settings, and do not
directly apply to these models. To overcome this lacuna, in this work we study
the problem of optimal control of a family of discrete-time countable
state-space Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) governed by an unknown parameter
$\theta\in\Theta$, and defined on a countably-infinite state space $\mathcal
X=\mathbb{Z}_+^d$, with finite action space $\mathcal A$, and an unbounded cost
function. We take a Bayesian perspective with the random unknown parameter
$\boldsymbol{\theta}^*$ generated via a given fixed prior distribution on
$\Theta$. To optimally control the unknown MDP, we propose an algorithm based
on Thompson sampling with dynamically-sized episodes: at the beginning of each
episode, the posterior distribution formed via Bayes' rule is used to produce a
parameter estimate, which then decides the policy applied during the episode.
To ensure the stability of the Markov chain obtained by following the policy
chosen for each parameter, we impose ergodicity assumptions. From this
condition and using the solution of the average cost Bellman equation, we
establish an $\tilde O(\sqrt{|\mathcal A|T})$ upper bound on the Bayesian
regret of our algorithm, where $T$ is the time-horizon. Finally, to elucidate
the applicability of our algorithm, we consider two different queuing models
with unknown dynamics, and show that our algorithm can be applied to develop
approximately optimal control algorithms.

that helicon has excellent accessibility under reactor-level conditions, and

its susceptibility to under-fitting due to imperfect pretreatment fit. It is
not uncommon for the linear combination, using nonnegative weights, of
pre-treatment period outcomes for the control units to inadequately approximate
the pre-treatment outcomes for the treated unit. To address both of these

Matching Control (SMC). The SMC method begins by performing the univariate
linear regression to establish a proper match between the pre-treatment periods

obtained by synthesizing (taking a weighted average) the matched controls. To
determine the weights in the synthesis procedure, we propose an approach that

When training neural network models with sounds recorded in only a few room

to those specific environments, resulting in overfitting. To address this
overfitting issue, we propose divided spectro-temporal attention. In comparison
to the baseline method, which utilizes a convolutional recurrent neural network
(CRNN) followed by a temporal multi-head self-attention layer (MHSA), we
introduce a separate spectral attention layer that aggregates spectral features
prior to the temporal MHSA. To achieve efficient spectral attention, we reduce
the frequency pooling size in the convolutional encoder of the baseline to
obtain a 3D tensor that incorporates information about frequency, time, and
channel. As a result, we can implement spectral attention with channel
embeddings, which is not possible in the baseline method dealing with only
temporal context in the RNN and MHSA layers. We demonstrate that the proposed
divided spectro-temporal attention significantly improves the performance of
sound event detection and localization scores for real test data from the
STARSS23 development dataset. Additionally, we show that various data
augmentations, such as frameshift, time masking, channel swapping, and moderate

rest-frame 0.1-2.4 keV band X-ray luminosities of $\sim$ 600,000 DESI groups
using two different algorithms in the overlap region of the two observations.
These groups span a large redshift range of $0.0 \le z_g \le 1.0$ and group
mass range of $10^{10.76}h^{-1}M_{\odot} \le M_h \le 10^{15.0}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$.
(1) Using the blind detection pipeline of eFEDS, we find that 10932 X-ray
emission peaks can be cross matched with our groups, $\sim 38 \%$ of which have
signal-to-noise ratio $\rm{S}/\rm{N} \geq 3$ in X-ray detection. Comparing to
the numbers reported in previous studies, this matched sample size is a factor
of $\sim 6$ larger. (2) By stacking X-ray maps around groups with similar
masses and redshifts, we measure the average X-ray luminosity of groups as a
function of halo mass in five redshift bins. We find, in a wide halo mass
range, the X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm X}$, is roughly linearly proportional to
$M_{h}$, and is quite independent to the redshift of the groups. (3) We use a
Poisson distribution to model the X-ray luminosities obtained using two
different algorithms and obtain best-fit $L_{\rm
X}=10^{28.46\pm0.03}M_{h}^{1.024\pm0.002}$ and $L_{\rm X}=10^{26.73 \pm
0.04}M_{h}^{1.140 \pm 0.003}$ scaling relations, respectively. The best-fit
slopes are flatter than the results previously obtained, but closer to a
self-similar prediction.

pretraining techniques, has led to the emergence of a vast zoo of publicly

become a crucial area of research. Previous research has primarily focused on
identifying the most powerful models within the model zoo, neglecting to fully
leverage the diverse inductive biases contained within. This paper argues that
the knowledge contained in weaker models is valuable and presents a method for
leveraging the diversity within the model zoo to improve out-of-distribution
generalization capabilities. Specifically, we investigate the behaviors of
various pretrained models across different domains of downstream tasks by
characterizing the variations in their encoded representations in terms of two
dimensions: diversity shift and correlation shift. This characterization
enables us to propose a new algorithm for integrating diverse pretrained
models, not limited to the strongest models, in order to achieve enhanced
out-of-distribution generalization performance. Our proposed method
demonstrates state-of-the-art empirical results on a variety of datasets, thus
validating the benefits of utilizing diverse knowledge.

stable relative to the competitor double-diamond (DD) and double-primitive (DP)
phases, and exhibits a window of stability intermediate to the classical
lamellar and columnar phases. This competition is widely thought to be
controlled by ""packing frustration"" -- the incompatibility of uniformly filling
melts with a locally preferred chain packing motif. Here, we reassess the
thermodynamics of cubic network formation in strongly-segregated diblock melts,
based on a recently developed medial strong segregation theory (""mSST"")
approach that directly connects the shape and thermodynamics of chain packing
environments to the medial geometry of tubular network surfaces. We first show
that medial packing significantly relaxes prior SST upper bounds on the free
energy of network phases, which we attribute to the spreading of terminal chain
ends within network nodal regions. Exploring geometric and thermodynamic
metrics of chain packing in network phases, we show that mSST reproduces
effects dependent on the elastic asymmetry of the blocks that are consistent
with SCFT at large $\chi N$. We then characterize geometric frustration in
terms of the spatially-variant distributions of local entropic and enthalpic
costs throughout the morphologies, extracted from mSST predictions. We find
that the DG morphology, due to its unique medial geometry in the nodal regions,
is stabilized by the incorporation of favorable, quasi-lamellar packing over
much of its morphology, motifs which are inaccessible to DD and DP morphologies
due to ""interior corners"" in their medial geometries. Finally, we use our
results to analyze ""hot spots"" of chain stretching and discuss implications for
network susceptibility to the uptake of guest molecules.

can achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple workload types. The
AULID approach combines the benefits from both traditional indexing techniques
and the learned indexes to reduce the I/O cost, the main overhead under disk
setting. Specifically, three aspects are taken into consideration in reducing
I/O costs: (1) reduce the overhead in updating the index structure; (2) induce
shorter paths from root to leaf node; (3) achieve better locality to minimize
the number of block reads required to complete a scan. Five principles are
proposed to guide the design of AULID which shows remarkable performance gains
and meanwhile is easy to implement. Our evaluation shows that AULID has
comparable storage costs to a B+-tree and is much smaller than other learned
indexes, and AULID is up to 2.11x, 8.63x, 1.72x, 5.51x, and 8.02x more

false positives and obtain the biggest catalog of planets in star clusters up

age validation, we obtain the radius--age diagram of these planets/candidates.
We find an increment of the fraction of Hot Jupiters(HJs) around 100 Myr and
attribute the increment to the flyby-induced high-e migration in star clusters.
An additional small bump of the fraction of HJs after 1 Gyr is detected, which
indicates the formation timescale of HJ around field stars is much larger than
that in star clusters. Thus, stellar environments play important roles in the
formation of HJs. The hot-Neptune desert occurs around 100 Myr in our sample. A
combination of photoevaporation and high-e migration may sculpt the hot-Neptune

platforms. With the growing concerns of algorithmic fairness, RSs are not only
expected to deliver high-quality personalized content, but are also demanded
not to discriminate against users based on their demographic information.
However, existing RSs could capture undesirable correlations between sensitive
features and observed user behaviors, leading to biased recommendations. Most
fair RSs tackle this problem by completely blocking the influences of sensitive
features on recommendations. But since sensitive features may also affect user
interests in a fair manner (e.g., race on culture-based preferences),
indiscriminately eliminating all the influences of sensitive features
inevitably degenerate the recommendations quality and necessary diversities. To
address this challenge, we propose a path-specific fair RS (PSF-RS) for
recommendations. Specifically, we summarize all fair and unfair correlations
between sensitive features and observed ratings into two latent proxy
mediators, where the concept of path-specific bias (PS-Bias) is defined based
on path-specific counterfactual inference. Inspired by Pearl's minimal change
principle, we address the PS-Bias by minimally transforming the biased factual
world into a hypothetically fair world, where a fair RS model can be learned
accordingly by solving a constrained optimization problem. For the technical
part, we propose a feasible implementation of PSF-RS, i.e., PSF-VAE, with
weakly-supervised variational inference, which robustly infers the latent
mediators such that unfairness can be mitigated while necessary recommendation
diversities can be maximally preserved simultaneously. Experiments conducted on
semi-simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PSF-RS.

magnetization switching is a key ingredient for the development of the
electrical controllable spintronic devices. Recently, the SOT induced
deterministic switching of the CoPt single layer has attracts a lot of
interests, as it could simplifies the structure and add new flexibility in the
design of SOT devices, compared with the Ferromagnet/Heavy metal bilayer
counterparts. Unfortunately, under the field-free switching strategies used
nowadays, the switching of the CoPt layer is often partial, which sets a major
obstacle for the practical applications. In this study, by growing the CoPt on
vicinal substrates, we could achieve the full-scale (100% switching ratio)
field-free switching of the CoPt layer. We demonstrate that when grown on
vicinal substrates, the magnetic easy axis of the CoPt could be tilted from the
normal direction of the film plane; the strength of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya
interaction (DMI) would be also be tuned as well. Micromagnetic simulation
further reveal that the field-free switching stems from tilted magnetic
anisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate, while the enhancement of DMI help
reducing the critical switching current. In addition, we also found that the
vicinal substrates could also enhance the SOT efficiency. With such simple
structure, full-scale switching, tunable DMI and SOT efficiency, our results
provide a new knob for the design SOT-MRAM and future spintronic devices.

minimizing impurities in the internal nodes. The most common impurity measures
are Shannon entropy and Gini impurity. These impurity measures are insensitive
to the order of training data and hence the final tree obtained is invariant to
any permutation of the data. This leads to a serious limitation in modeling
data instances that have order dependencies. In this work, we propose the use
of Effort-To-Compress (ETC) - a complexity measure, for the first time, as an
impurity measure. Unlike Shannon entropy and Gini impurity, structural impurity
based on ETC is able to capture order dependencies in the data, thus obtaining
potentially different decision trees for different permutations of the same
data instances (Permutation Decision Trees). We then introduce the notion of
Permutation Bagging achieved using permutation decision trees without the need
for random feature selection and sub-sampling. We compare the performance of
the proposed permutation bagged decision trees with Random Forests. Our model
does not assume that the data instances are independent and identically

perturbations. One of the strongest defense mechanisms is \emph{Adversarial
Training} (AT). In this paper, we aim to address two predominant problems in
AT. First, there is still little consensus on how to set hyperparameters with a
performance guarantee for AT research, and customized settings impede a fair
comparison between different model designs in AT research. Second, the robustly
trained neural networks struggle to generalize well and suffer from tremendous
overfitting. This paper focuses on the primary AT framework - Projected
Gradient Descent Adversarial Training (PGD-AT). We approximate the dynamic of
PGD-AT by a continuous-time Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), and show
that the diffusion term of this SDE determines the robust generalization. An
immediate implication of this theoretical finding is that robust generalization
is positively correlated with the ratio between learning rate and batch size.
We further propose a novel approach, \emph{Diffusion Enhanced Adversarial
Training} (DEAT), to manipulate the diffusion term to improve robust
generalization with virtually no extra computational burden. We theoretically
show that DEAT obtains a tighter generalization bound than PGD-AT. Our
empirical investigation is extensive and firmly attests that DEAT universally
outperforms PGD-AT by a significant margin.

quantum computers would provide a genuine advantage with respect to purely
classical approaches. In this work, we propose two criteria for evaluating the
potential of the two leading quantum approaches for this class of problems. The
first criterion applies to the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm
and sets an upper bound to the level of noise that can be tolerated in quantum
hardware as a function of the target precision and problem size. We find a
crippling effect of noise with an overall scaling of the precision that is
generically less favourable than in the corresponding classical algorithms.
This is due to the studied molecule being unrelated to the hardware dynamics,
hence its noise; conversely the hardware noise populates states of arbitrary
energy of the studied molecule. The second criterion applies to the Quantum
Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm that is often presented as the go-to
replacement of VQE upon availability of (noiseless) fault-tolerant quantum
computers. QPE suffers from the phenomenon known as the orthogonality
catastrophe that generically leads to an exponentially small success
probability when the size of the problem grows. Our criterion allows one to
estimate quantitatively the importance of this phenomenon from the knowledge of
the variance of the energy of the input state used in the calculation.

most important step toward understanding the mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity; critical behaviors of ordered phases are expected to be
correlated with superconductivity. Efforts to find such ordered phases have
been focused on symmetry breaking in the pseudogap region while the Fermi
liquid-like metal region beyond the so-called critical doping $p_{c}$ has been
regarded as a trivial disordered state. Here, we used rotational anisotropy
second harmonic generation and uncovered a broken mirror symmetry in the Fermi
liquid-like phase in (Bi,Pb)$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ with $p =
0.205 > p_{c}$. By tracking the temperature evolution of the symmetry-breaking
response, we verify an order parameter-like behavior with the onset temperature
$T_{up}$ at which the strange metal to Fermi liquid-like-metal crossover takes
place. Complementary angle-resolved photoemission study showed that the
quasiparticle coherence between $\mathrm{CuO_{2}}$ bilayers is enhanced in
proportion to the symmetry-breaking response as a function of temperature,
indicating that the change in metallicity and symmetry breaking are linked.
These observations contradict the conventional quantum disordered scenario for
over-critical-doped cuprates and provide new insight into the nature of the
quantum critical point in cuprates.

develop an out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmark termed Do-GOOD for the
fine-Grained analysis on Document image-related tasks specifically. The Do-GOOD

We then evaluate the robustness and perform a fine-grained analysis of 5 latest

recording to leverage two visual cues, namely speaker identity and
synchronization, to enhance performance compared to audio-only algorithms.
However, the visual front-end in AVSE is often derived from a pre-trained model
or end-to-end trained, making it unclear which visual cue contributes more to
the speaker extraction performance. This raises the question of how to better
utilize visual cues. To address this issue, we propose two training strategies
that decouple the learning of the two visual cues. Our experimental results
demonstrate that both visual cues are useful, with the synchronization cue
having a higher impact. We introduce a more explainable model, the Decoupled
Audio-Visual Speaker Extraction (DAVSE) model, which leverages both visual

  States",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Breaking parity (P) symmetry in C6 symmetric crystals is a common routine to
implement a valley-topological phase. At an interface between two crystals of
opposite valley phases, the so-called valley topological edge states emerge,
and they have been proven useful for wave transport with robustness against 120
degree bending and a certain level of disorder. However, whether these
attractive transport features are bound with the valley topology or due to
topological-irrelevant mechanisms remains unclear. In this letter, we discuss
this question by examining transport properties of photonic edge states with
varied degrees of the P-breaking that tune the valley topology, and reveal that
the edge states preserve their transport robustness insensitive to the topology
even when the P-symmetry is recovered. Instead, a unique modal character of the
edge states--with localized momentum hotspots around high-symmetric K (K')
points--is recognized to play the key role, which only concerns the existence
of the valleys in the bulk band structures, and has no special requirement on
the topology. The ""non-topological"" notion of valley edge states is introduced
to conceptualize this modal character, leading to a coherent understanding of
bending immunity in a range of edge modes implemented in C3 symmetric
crystals--such as valley topological edge states, topological edge states of 2D
Zak phase, topological-trivial edge states and so on--, and to new designs in
general rhombic lattices--with exemplified bending angle as large as 150

In this paper, we investigate the multiband GW detections of BBHs and

considering different formation models as well as the merger rate density
constrained by the current observations (GWTC-3). We specifically consider the
astrodynamical middle-frequency interferometer GW observatory (AMIGO) in the
middle-frequency band and estimate that it may detect $21$-$91$ BBHs with
signal-to-noise ratio $\varrho\geq8$ in a $4$-yr observation period. The
multiband observations by the low-frequency detectors [Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA) and Taiji] and AMIGO may detect $5$-$33$ BBHs with
$\varrho_{\rm LT}\geq5$ and $\varrho_{\rm AMI}\geq5$, which can evolve to the
high-frequency band within $4$ yr and can be detected by the Cosmic Explorer
(CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET). The joint observations of
LISA-Taiji-AMIGO-ET-CE may localize the majority of the detectable BBHs in sky
areas of $7\times10^{-7}$ to $2\times10^{-3}$ deg$^2$, which is improved by a

to do so is a fine study of the abstract numerical range and its relation with
the BJ-orthogonality. Among other results, we provide a characterization of
BJ-orthogonality for spaces of vector-valued bounded functions in terms of the
domain set and the dual of the target space, which is applied to get results
for spaces of vector-valued continuous functions, uniform algebras, Lipschitz

psycholinguistics and cognitive sciences [Jackson et al.,2019]. While several
multilingual colexification datasets exist, there is untapped potential in
using this information to bootstrap datasets across such semantic features. In
this paper, we aim to demonstrate how colexifications can be leveraged to
create such cross-lingual datasets. We showcase curation procedures which
result in a dataset covering 142 languages across 21 language families across
the world. The dataset includes ratings of concreteness and affectiveness,
mapped with phonemes and phonological features. We further analyze the dataset
along different dimensions to demonstrate potential of the proposed procedures
in facilitating further interdisciplinary research in psychology, cognitive
science, and multilingual natural language processing (NLP). Based on initial
investigations, we observe that i) colexifications that are closer in
concreteness/affectiveness are more likely to colexify; ii) certain
initial/last phonemes are significantly correlated with
concreteness/affectiveness intra language families, such as /k/ as the initial
phoneme in both Turkic and Tai-Kadai correlated with concreteness, and /p/ in
Dravidian and Sino-Tibetan correlated with Valence; iii) the type-to-token
ratio (TTR) of phonemes are positively correlated with concreteness across
several language families, while the length of phoneme segments are negatively
correlated with concreteness; iv) certain phonological features are negatively
correlated with concreteness across languages. The dataset is made public
online for further research.

enchanted biologists as well as researchers in other disciplines. It has been
established during the last decade that an aggregation of fire ants exhibits
viscoelasticity with respect to external compression and shearing among
numerous unusual mechanical properties. In addition to clarifying that the
Cheerios effect is neither sufficient nor essential for the ant raft, we
perform the force-displacement and creep experiments on the ant raft and
concentrate on unearthing properties that derive from the unique combination of
self-healing and activeness of its constituent. Varying pull speed results in
distinct mechanical responses and fracture patterns, characteristic of ductile
and brittle material. By image processing, we count the number of ants that
actively participate in the stress-strain relation and determine their
orientation to map out the force chain. The latter information reveals that the
pull force expedites the alignment of fire ants, in analogy to the effect of an
electric field on liquid crystal polymers. In addition, the raft can be
tailored not to transversely deform in response to the axial strain. Without
resorting to specific geometry structures, this property of zero Poisson's
ratio is enabled by the active recruitment of ants from the top to bottom layer
to keep the raft from disintegrating. Furthermore, effective Young's modulus
can also be customized and is proportion to either the raft length or its
inverse, depending on whether the raft is in the elastic or plastic region.

have garnered attention in the context of anytime computation due to their

address this shortcoming, we propose an elegant post-hoc modification, based on

are largely independent of initial conditions. For stellar masses $>
0.3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, we find that observed initial accretion rates
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{init}$ are comparable to or exceed $\dot{M}_\mathrm{crit}$.
Furthermore, stellar SAM after the disk phase scales with the stellar magnetic
field strength as a power-law with an exponent of $-1.1$. For lower stellar
masses, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{init}$ is predicted to be smaller than
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{crit}$ and the initial conditions are imprinted in the stellar

These values match observed large-scale magnetic field measurements of young

strength agrees with a theoretically-motivated scaling relation. The scaling
law between stellar SAM, mass, and the magnetic field strength is consistent
for young stars, where these parameters are constrained by observations. Due to

coordinate description, the configuration space dimension is reduced, which
provides real-time planning capability. The hybrid trajectory optimization is
transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem and solved in a
receding-horizon planning fashion. Mode switching is facilitated by associating
optimized motion durations with a predefined traversal sequence. A
multi-objective cost function is formulated to further improve the traversal
performance. Additionally, map sampling, terrain simplification, and tracking

In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the encountered curse of
dimensionality by mapping the problem to a significantly lower-dimensional
space via a Markovian projection (MP) idea. The output of this model reduction
technique is a low-dimensional SRN (potentially even one dimensional) that
preserves the marginal distribution of the original high-dimensional SRN
system. The dynamics of the projected process are obtained by solving a related
optimization problem via a discrete $L^2$ regression. By solving the resulting
projected Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations for the reduced-dimensional
SRN, we obtain projected IS parameters, which are then mapped back to the
original full-dimensional SRN system, resulting in an efficient IS-MC estimator
for rare events probabilities of the full-dimensional SRN. Our analysis and
numerical experiments reveal that the proposed MP-HJB-IS approach substantially
reduces the MC estimator variance, resulting in a lower computational
complexity in the rare event regime than standard MC estimators.

node set without explicit graph structures, i.e., graph-free data. Our idea is
to implicitly encode topology structure information into the node attributes in
the synthesized graph-free data, whose topology is reduced to an identity
matrix. Specifically, SFGC contains two collaborative components: (1) a
training trajectory meta-matching scheme for effectively synthesizing
small-scale graph-free data; (2) a graph neural feature score metric for
dynamically evaluating the quality of the condensed data. Through training
trajectory meta-matching, SFGC aligns the long-term GNN learning behaviors
between the large-scale graph and the condensed small-scale graph-free data,
ensuring comprehensive and compact transfer of informative knowledge to the
graph-free data. Afterward, the underlying condensed graph-free data would be
dynamically evaluated with the graph neural feature score, which is a
closed-form metric for ensuring the excellent expressiveness of the condensed
graph-free data. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of SFGC across
different condensation ratios.

is often taken for granted that optimal network parameters exist, and a common
practice is to apply available optimization algorithms to search for them. In
this work, we show that the existence of an optimal solution is not always
guaranteed, especially in the context of {\em sparse} ReLU neural networks. In
particular, we first show that optimization problems involving deep networks
with certain sparsity patterns do not always have optimal parameters, and that
optimization algorithms may then diverge. Via a new topological relation
between sparse ReLU neural networks and their linear counterparts, we derive --
using existing tools from real algebraic geometry -- an algorithm to verify
that a given sparsity pattern suffers from this issue. Then, the existence of a
global optimum is proved for every concrete optimization problem involving a
shallow sparse ReLU neural network of output dimension one. Overall, the
analysis is based on the investigation of two topological properties of the
space of functions implementable as sparse ReLU neural networks: a best
approximation property, and a closedness property, both in the uniform norm.
This is studied both for (finite) domains corresponding to practical training
on finite training sets, and for more general domains such as the unit cube.
This allows us to provide conditions for the guaranteed existence of an optimum
given a sparsity pattern. The results apply not only to several sparsity
patterns proposed in recent works on network pruning/sparsification, but also
to classical dense neural networks, including architectures not covered by
existing results.

this method prohibitively expensive to be employed in large-scale databases

framework can rapidly answer such queries at low cost without scanning the

for decision trees and random forests that transforms the inference phase of
these classification models into a set of range queries, which in turn can be
efficiently executed by leveraging multidimensional indexing structures. Our
experiments show that queries over large data catalogs with hundreds of
millions of objects can be processed in a few seconds using a single server,

model without privacy disclosure. Existing methods often take a common
assumption that the data from different hospitals have the same modalities.
However, such a setting is difficult to fully satisfy in practical
applications, since the imaging guidelines may be different between hospitals,
which makes the number of individuals with the same set of modalities limited.
To this end, we formulate this practical-yet-challenging cross-modal vertical
federated learning task, in which shape data from multiple hospitals have
different modalities with a small amount of multi-modality data collected from
the same individuals. To tackle such a situation, we develop a novel framework,
namely Federated Consistent Regularization constrained Feature Disentanglement
(Fed-CRFD), for boosting MRI reconstruction by effectively exploring the
overlapping samples (individuals with multi-modalities) and solving the domain
shift problem caused by different modalities. Particularly, our Fed-CRFD
involves an intra-client feature disentangle scheme to decouple data into
modality-invariant and modality-specific features, where the modality-invariant
features are leveraged to mitigate the domain shift problem. In addition, a
cross-client latent representation consistency constraint is proposed
specifically for the overlapping samples to further align the
modality-invariant features extracted from different modalities. Hence, our
method can fully exploit the multi-source data from hospitals while alleviating
the domain shift problem. Extensive experiments on two typical MRI datasets
demonstrate that our network clearly outperforms state-of-the-art MRI
reconstruction methods. The source code will be publicly released upon the

manifestations of intriguing physics in condensed matter. In this respect,
quantifying the dynamics of normal modes that themselves arise from these

importance. Of the different types of coupling that are often important,
spin-lattice coupling is relevant to several sub-fields of condensed matter
physics; examples include spintronics, high-TC superconductivity, and
topological materials. While theories of materials where spin-lattice coupling
is relevant can sometimes be used to infer the magnitude and character of this
interaction, experimental approaches that can directly measure it are rare and
incomplete. Here we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction to directly access the
spin-lattice coupling by measuring both ultrafast atomic motion and the
associated spin dynamics following the excitation of a coherent electromagnon
by an intense THz pulse in a multiferroic hexaferrite. Comparing the dynamics
of the two different components, one striking outcome is the different phase
shifts relative to the driving field. This phase shift provides insight into
the excitation process of such a coupled mode. This direct observation of
combined lattice and magnetization dynamics paves the way to access the
mode-selective spin-lattice coupling strength, which remains a missing
fundamental parameter for ultrafast control of magnetism and is relevant to a
wide variety of correlated electron physics.

learning on clinical data. To realize exact privacy preserving computation of
kernel methods, we propose FLAKE, a Federated Learning Approach for KErnel
methods on horizontally distributed data. With FLAKE, the data sources mask
their data so that a centralized instance can compute a Gram matrix without
compromising privacy. The Gram matrix allows to calculate many kernel matrices,
which can be used to train kernel-based machine learning algorithms such as
Support Vector Machines. We prove that FLAKE prevents an adversary from
learning the input data or the number of input features under a semi-honest
threat model. Experiments on clinical and synthetic data confirm that FLAKE is
outperforming the accuracy and efficiency of comparable methods. The time
needed to mask the data and to compute the Gram matrix is several orders of
magnitude less than the time a Support Vector Machine needs to be trained.
Thus, FLAKE can be applied to many use cases.

time by suggesting two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled
adaptation with guided exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context
embedding for subsequent adaptation of SAGE based on scale information. Then,
SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a
specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias, which encourages selecting
nearby locations to determine the next location. The locality bias gradually
decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that
Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves

problems include impactful real-world applications but are known as NP-hard.
Existing methods are facing challenges, particularly in large-scale problems
that require the coordination of numerous agents to cover thousands of cities.
This paper proposes a new deep-learning framework to solve large-scale min-max
routing problems. We model the simultaneous decision-making of multiple agents
as a sequential generation process, allowing the utilization of scalable
deep-learning models for sequential decision-making. In the sequentially
approximated problem, we propose a scalable contextual Transformer model,
Equity-Transformer, which generates sequential actions considering an equitable
workload among other agents. The effectiveness of Equity-Transformer is
demonstrated through its superior performance in two representative min-max
routing tasks: the min-max multiple traveling salesman problem (min-max mTSP)
and the min-max multiple pick-up and delivery problem (min-max mPDP). Notably,
our method achieves significant reductions of runtime, approximately 335 times,

value for disease analysis. Generally, fully-supervised algorithms for this
task require pixel-wise manual annotations, which is especially time-consuming
and laborious for the high nuclei density. To alleviate the annotation burden,
we seek to solve the problem through image-level weakly supervised learning,
which is underexplored for nuclei instance segmentation. Compared with most
existing methods using other weak annotations (scribble, point, etc.) for
nuclei instance segmentation, our method is more labor-saving. The obstacle to
using image-level annotations in nuclei instance segmentation is the lack of
adequate location information, leading to severe nuclei omission or overlaps.
In this paper, we propose a novel image-level weakly supervised method, called
cyclic learning, to solve this problem. Cyclic learning comprises a front-end
classification task and a back-end semi-supervised instance segmentation task
to benefit from multi-task learning (MTL). We utilize a deep learning
classifier with interpretability as the front-end to convert image-level labels
to sets of high-confidence pseudo masks and establish a semi-supervised
architecture as the back-end to conduct nuclei instance segmentation under the
supervision of these pseudo masks. Most importantly, cyclic learning is
designed to circularly share knowledge between the front-end classifier and the
back-end semi-supervised part, which allows the whole system to fully extract
the underlying information from image-level labels and converge to a better
optimum. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the good generality of our
method, which outperforms other image-level weakly supervised methods for
nuclei instance segmentation, and achieves comparable performance to
fully-supervised methods.

framework draws a precise decision boundary without accessing weights or

(1) extracting a refined pseudo-labeled dataset from an unlabeled dataset, and
(2) training a lightweight and robust model on the top of LM, which learns an
accurate decision boundary from an extracted noisy dataset. Throughout in-depth
investigations on various datasets, we demonstrated that CELDA reaches new
state-of-the-art in weakly-supervised text classification and narrows the gap

applied universally to any LM and has the potential to scale to larger models,

Social robots could alleviate the pain of loneliness, particularly for those

viewed a video of one of the three robots(machine-like, animal-like, and

revealed that when individuals were lonelier, the tendency to anthropomorphize
human-like robots increased more than that of animal-like robots. The

increase in anthropomorphic tendency predicted the heightened purchase intent.
The findings imply that human-like robots induce lonely individuals' desire to

of quantum gravity. In this letter we suggest a thermal mechanism whereby this
quantum of length arises in flat, Euclidean spacetime $\mathbb{R}^d$. For this
we consider the infinite sequence of all flat, Euclidean spacetimes
$\mathbb{R}^{d'}$ with $d'\geq d$, and postulate a probability distribution for
each $d'$ to occur. The distribution considered is that of a canonical ensemble
at temperature $T$, the energy levels those of a 1-dimensional harmonic
oscillator. Since both the harmonic energy levels and the spacetime dimensions
are evenly spaced, one can identify the canonical distribution of
harmonic-oscillator eigenvalues with that of dimensions $d'$. The state
describing this statistical ensemble has a mean square deviation in the
position operator, that can be interpreted as a quantum of length. Thus placing
an oscillator in thermal equilibrium with a bath provides a thermal mechanism
whereby a zero-point length is generated. The quantum-gravitational
implications of this construction are then discussed. In particular, a model is
presented that realises a conjectured duality between a weakly gravitational,
strongly quantum system and a weakly quantum, strongly gravitational system.

is parameterized by a positive integer s, which defines the required level of

queries, we first explore an oracle based on the line graph of the given
hypergraph and discuss its limitations: the main one is that the line graph is
typically orders of magnitude larger than the original hypergraph. We then
introduce HypED, a landmark-based oracle with a predefined size, built directly
on the hypergraph, thus avoiding constructing the line graph. Our framework
allows to approximately answer vertex-to-vertex, vertex-to-hyperedge, and
hyperedge-to-hyperedge s-distance queries for any value of s. A key observation
at the basis of our framework is that, as s increases, the hypergraph becomes
more fragmented. We show how this can be exploited to improve the placement of
landmarks, by identifying the s-connected components of the hypergraph. For
this task, we devise an efficient algorithm based on the union-find technique
and a dynamic inverted index. We experimentally evaluate HypED on several
real-world hypergraphs and prove its versatility in answering s-distance
queries for different values of s. Our framework allows answering such queries
in fractions of a millisecond, while allowing fine-grained control of the
trade-off between index size and approximation error at creation time. Finally,
we prove the usefulness of the s-distance oracle in two applications, namely,
hypergraph-based recommendation and the approximation of the s-closeness

involve a longer chain of divergence accumulation, they tend to manifest
greater divergence, subsequently leading to performance decline. Both

systems. However, anomaly detection for these systems remains challenging,
especially since that anomalous data is scarce and labeling such data is
tedious and even dangerous. Therefore, it is advisable to make use of
unsupervised or semi-supervised methods, especially for semi-supervised
learning which utilizes unsupervised learning as a feature extraction mechanism
to aid the supervised part when only a small number of labels are available.
This study systematically compares semi-supervised learning methods applied for
anomaly detection in hydraulic condition monitoring systems. Firstly, thorough
data analysis and feature learning were carried out to understand the
open-sourced hydraulic condition monitoring dataset. Then, various methods were
implemented and evaluated including traditional stand-alone semi-supervised
learning models (e.g., one-class SVM, Robust Covariance), ensemble models
(e.g., Isolation Forest), and deep neural network based models (e.g.,
autoencoder, Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine (HELM)). Typically, this
study customized and implemented an extreme learning machine based
semi-supervised HELM model and verified its superiority over other
semi-supervised methods. Extensive experiments show that the customized HELM
model obtained state-of-the-art performance with the highest accuracy (99.5%),
the lowest false positive rate (0.015), and the best F1-score (0.985) beating
other semi-supervised methods.

popular extension to mean regression models where each parameter of an
arbitrary distribution is modelled through covariates. While such models have
been developed for univariate and bivariate responses, the truly multivariate
case remains extremely challenging for both computational and theoretical
reasons. Alternative approaches to GAMLSS may allow for higher dimensional
response vectors to be modelled jointly but often assume a fixed dependence
structure not depending on covariates or are limited with respect to modelling
flexibility or computational aspects. We contribute to this gap in the
literature and propose a truly multivariate distributional model, which allows
one to benefit from the flexibility of GAMLSS even when the response has
dimension larger than two or three. Building on copula regression, we model the
dependence structure of the response through a Gaussian copula, while the
marginal distributions can vary across components. Our model is highly
parameterized but estimation becomes feasible with Bayesian inference employing
shrinkage priors. We demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach in a

suspension plasma sprayed GZ and YSZ layers while the latter had an additional

Both coatings performed similarly in furnace cycling test (FCT) and burner rig

  In [10] it was proved that if the order of a group is $pe$ then all
sufficiently large subsets of the non-identity elements are $t$-weakly

even elements which are those in the coset $\mathbb{Z}_p\rtimes_{\varphi}

of the non-identity elements admit an alternating parity $t$-weak sequencing.
This result has been obtained using a hybrid approach that combines both Ramsey

  The same procedure works also for studying the weak sequenceability for
generic sufficiently large (not necessarily balanced) sets. Here we have been

Therefore, moving the computational complexity required for HARQ schemes from
the transmitter to the receiver may provide a way to overcome this trade-off.
To achieve this, we propose the Reinforcement-based Adaptive Feedback (RAF)
scheme, in which the receiver adaptively learns how much additional redundancy
it requires to decode a packet and sends rich feedback (i.e., more than a
single bit), requesting the coded retransmission of specific symbols.
Simulation results show that the RAF scheme achieves a better trade-off between
energy-efficiency, reliability, and latency, compared to existing HARQ
solutions and a fixed threshold-based policy. Our RAF scheme can easily adapt
to different modulation schemes, and since it relies on the posterior
probabilities of the codeword symbols at the decoder, it can generalize to

negative queries corresponding to different moments. Specifically, our model
learns to predict the target moment from the joint probability of the given

way, it leverages the surrounding background to consider relative importance,
improving moment sensitivity. Extensive experiments on Charades-STA and

task graphs over dataflow architectures. We show how a task graph can be
statically analyzed to understand its steady-state behavior, and we use this
information to partition it into temporally multiplexed components of spatially
executed tasks. Results on synthetic and realistic workloads show how streaming
scheduling can increase speedup and device utilization over a traditional
scheduling approach.

predictive intervals. We study conformal prediction with missing values in the

quantification. We first show that the marginal coverage guarantee of conformal
prediction holds on imputed data for any missingness distribution and almost
all imputation functions. However, we emphasize that the average coverage
varies depending on the pattern of missing values: conformal methods tend to
construct prediction intervals that under-cover the response conditionally to
some missing patterns. This motivates our novel generalized conformalized
quantile regression framework, missing data augmentation, which yields
prediction intervals that are valid conditionally to the patterns of missing
values, despite their exponential number. We then show that a universally
consistent quantile regression algorithm trained on the imputed data is Bayes
optimal for the pinball risk, thus achieving valid coverage conditionally to
any given data point. Moreover, we examine the case of a linear model, which
demonstrates the importance of our proposal in overcoming the
heteroskedasticity induced by missing values. Using synthetic and data from
critical care, we corroborate our theory and report improved performance of our

a stable graph representation for states termed as causal-origin

impressive resilience to non-stationarity. We supplement our approach with a

all K-12 students as they lack adequately trained teachers. While cascade
models of in-service teacher-professional development (PD) can rapidly deploy
PD-programs through multiple levels of trainers to reach all teachers, they
suffer from many limitations and are often ineffective. We therefore propose an
adapted cascade model to deploy a primary school DE teacher-PD program

(i) are active teachers in the region, (ii) have a prolonged trainer-PD with
experts who piloted the teacher-PD program to acquire adult-trainer and
DE-related competences, and (iii) are supported by the experts throughout the
deployment. To validate the deployment model we used data from 14
teacher-trainers, the 700 teachers they trained, and 350 teachers trained by
experts. The teacher-trainer findings demonstrate that the adapted cascade
model effectively addresses most cascade models' limitations. The
teacher-related findings further validate the adapted cascade model in terms of
perception, motivation and adoption which are at least equivalent to those
obtained with the experts. To conclude, the adapted cascade model is an
effective means of spreading primary school DE PD-programs at a large scale and

the prime candidates to explain heating of the solar corona. However, direct
signatures of nanoflares are difficult to determine, and unambiguous
observational evidence is still lacking. Numerical models that include
accelerated electrons and can reproduce flaring conditions are essential in
understanding how low-energetic events act as a heating mechanism of the
corona, and how such events are able to produce signatures in the spectral
lines that can be detected through observations. We investigate the effects of
accelerated electrons in synthetic spectra from a 3D radiative
magnetohydrodynamics simulation to better understand small-scale heating events
and their impact on the solar atmosphere. We synthesised the chromospheric Ca
II and Mg II lines and the transition region Si IV resonance lines from a quiet
Sun numerical simulation that includes accelerated electrons. We calculated the
contribution function to the intensity to better understand how the lines are
formed, and what factors are contributing to the detailed shape of the spectral
profiles. The synthetic spectra are highly affected by variations in
temperature and vertical velocity. Beam heating exceeds conductive heating at
the heights where the spectral lines form, indicating that the electrons should
contribute to the heating of the lower atmosphere and hence affect the line
profiles. However, we find that it is difficult to determine specific
signatures from the non-thermal electrons due to the complexity of the
atmospheric response to the heating in combination with the relatively low
energy output (~1e21 erg/s). Even so, our results contribute to understanding
small-scale heating events in the solar atmosphere, and give further guidance
to future observations.

and discontinuous phase transitions. Discontinuous phase transitions are
normally accompanied with significant structural changes, and nearly all of
them have the kinetic pathway of nucleation and growth, if the system does not
suffer from glassy dynamics. Here, in a system of barrier-controlled reactive
particles, we find that the discontinuous freezing transition of a
non-equilibrium hyperuniform fluid into an absorbing state does not have the
kinetic pathway of nucleation and growth, and the transition is triggered by
long wavelength fluctuations. The transition rate decreases with increasing the
system size, which suggests that the metastable hyperuniform fluid is
kinetically stable in an infinitely large system. This challenges the common
understanding of metastability in discontinuous phase transitions. Moreover, we
find that the ``metastable yet kinetically stable'' hyperuniform fluid features
a new scaling in the structure factor $S(k \rightarrow 0) \sim k^{1.2}$ in 2D,
which is the third dynamic hyperuniform state in addition to the critical
hyperuniform state with $S(k \rightarrow 0) \sim k^{0.45}$ and the

the time reversal symmetry by applying the matrix transposition and examining
if it remains physical. However, recent discoveries regarding the indefinite
causal order of quantum processes suggest that there may be other, more general
symmetry transformations of time besides the complete reversal. In this work,
we introduce an expanded concept of matrix transposition, the generalized
transposition, that takes into account general bipartite unitary
transformations of a quantum operation's future and past Hilbert spaces,
allowing for making the time axis definitely lie in a superposed direction,
which generalizes the previously studied `indefinite direction of time', i.e.,
superposition of the forward and the backward time evolution. This framework
may have applications in approaches that treat time and space equally like
quantum gravity, where the spatio-temporal structure is explained to emerge
from quantum mechanics. We apply this generalized transposition to investigate
a continuous generalization of perfect tensors, a dynamic version of tracing
out a subsystem, and the compatibility of multiple time axes in bipartite
quantum interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that when a bipartite interaction
is consistent with more distinct local temporal axes, there is a reduced
allowance for information exchange between the two parties in order to prevent
causality violations.

We explore the current properties of ED-2 members in phase-space, and also
analyse the expected distribution via orbit integration. In addition, we study
the metallicity of ED-2 using APOGEE DR17 and LAMOST DR8 (and re-calibrated
DR3). ED-2 forms a compact group in the $x-z$ (or $R-z$) plane, showing a
pancake-like structure as it crosses the Solar neighbourhood. Dynamically it is
most similar the globular clusters NGC 3201 and NGC 6101, and the stellar
stream Ylgr and Phlegethon. However, its orbit is sufficiently different that
none of these objects is likely to be ED-2's progenitor. We also find ED-2 to
be quite metal-poor, with all of its stars $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \leq -2.42$, with a
median $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} = -2.60^{+0.20}_{-0.21}$. At this low metallicity, it
is unlikely that ED-2 stems from any known globular cluster, instead, ED-2
seems to be in a similar category as the recently discovered Phoenix and C-19
stellar streams. We find that ED-2 members are scattered across the whole sky,
which is due to its current orbital phase. We predict that as this object moves
to its next apocentre it will acquire an on-sky morphology that is akin to cold
stellar streams. Finally, since ED-2 is nearing pericentre, we predict that
additional members found below the plane should have large radial velocities,
close to $\sim$ 500 km/s in the present-day direction of the globular cluster

problems, where mismatches frequently occur because of inherent ambiguity. The
unique position information associated with repeated patterns makes coordinate

feature correspondences. However, the issue of appropriate coordinate
representation has remained unresolved. In this study, we demonstrate that
geometric-invariant coordinate representations, such as barycentric
coordinates, can significantly reduce mismatches between features. The first
step is to establish a theoretical foundation for geometrically invariant

that DEGREE alleviates the problem of repeated patterns and helps achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, DEGREE also reports competitive
performance in the third Image Matching Challenge at CVPR 2021. This approach

equations of thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes is well-known as a significant
source of uncertainty for accuracy of output predictions. This uncertainty,
called model uncertainty, is usually represented by multiplicative
(log)-Gaussian variables whose estimation requires solving an inverse problem
based on a set of adequately chosen real experiments. One method from the TH
field, called CIRCE, addresses it. We present in the paper a generalization of
this method to several groups of experiments each having their own properties,
including different ranges for input conditions and different geometries. An
individual Gaussian distribution is therefore estimated for each group in order
to investigate whether the model uncertainty is homogeneous between the groups,
or should depend on the group. To this end, a multi-group CIRCE is proposed
where a variance parameter is estimated for each group jointly to a mean
parameter common to all the groups to preserve the uniqueness of the
best-estimate model. The ECME algorithm for Maximum Likelihood Estimation
developed in \cite{Celeux10} is extended to the latter context, then applied to
a demonstration case. Finally, it is implemented on two experimental setups
that differ in geometry to assess uncertainty of critical mass flow.

accuracy and instability prediction. To solve this problem, we propose a
Self-adapTive Ambiguity Reduction (STAR) loss by exploiting the properties of
semantic ambiguity. We find that semantic ambiguity results in the anisotropic
predicted distribution, which inspires us to use predicted distribution to
represent semantic ambiguity. Based on this, we design the STAR loss that
measures the anisotropism of the predicted distribution. Compared with the
standard regression loss, STAR loss is encouraged to be small when the
predicted distribution is anisotropic and thus adaptively mitigates the impact
of semantic ambiguity. Moreover, we propose two kinds of eigenvalue restriction
methods that could avoid both distribution's abnormal change and the model's
premature convergence. Finally, the comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
STAR loss outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks, i.e.,
COFW, 300W, and WFLW, with negligible computation overhead. Code is at

depend on any prior assumptions about the shape of the coronal loops. We find
that the bundle of magnetic loops shows damped transverse oscillations in
response to perturbations in two separate instances with oscillation periods of
177 s and 191 s, velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 16 km/s and damping times
of 176 s and 198 s, respectively. The coronal oscillations lead to the
development of velocity shear in the simulated corona resulting in the
formation of vortices seen in the velocity field caused by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability, contributing to the damping and dissipation of the transverse
oscillations. The oscillation parameters and evolution observed are in line
with the values typically seen in observations of coronal loop oscillations.
The dynamic evolution of the coronal loop bundle suggests the models of
monolithic and static coronal loops with constant lengths might need to be
re-evaluated by relaxing the assumption of highly idealised waveguides.

Evaluation of style reproducing in natural poetry generation remains a problem.
I used 3 character-based LSTM-models to work with style reproducing assessment.
All three models were trained on the corpus of texts by famous Russian-speaking
poets. Samples were shown to the assessors and 4 answer options were offered,
the style of which poet this sample reproduces. In addition, the assessors were
asked how well they were familiar with the work of the poet they had named.
Students studying history of literature were the assessors, 94 answers were
received. It has appeared that accuracy of definition of style increases if the
assessor can quote the poet by heart. Each model showed at least 0.7
macro-average accuracy. The experiment showed that it is better to involve a

positive when the perturbation is turned on, uniformly in the length of the

describing their semantics as fixpoints of semantic operators. We define 2- and
3-valued semantic operators for dAEL. Using these operators, approximation
fixpoint theory allows us to define a class of semantics for dAEL, each based
on different intuitions that are well-studied in the context of AEL. We define
a mapping from dAEL to AEL and identify the conditions under which the mapping
preserves semantics, and furthermore argue that when it does not, the dAEL
semantics is more desirable than the AEL-induced semantics since dAEL manages
to contain inconsistencies.

robustness to perturbations over single neural networks partly due to their

enhance diversity by formalizing a repulsion term based on a network similarity

over-parameterization, while direct function-space repulsion has been found to
produce little improvement over DEs. To sidestep these difficulties, we propose
First-order Repulsive Deep Ensemble (FoRDE), an ensemble learning method based
on ParVI, which performs repulsion in the space of first-order input gradients.
As input gradients uniquely characterize a function up to translation and are
much smaller in dimension than the weights, this method guarantees that
ensemble members are functionally different. Intuitively, diversifying the
input gradients encourages each network to learn different features, which is
expected to improve the robustness of an ensemble. Experiments on image

here that the non-equilibrium excitation in an ultrafast magnetization

models can achieve cross-lingual transfer. One common way to improve this
transfer is to perform realignment steps before fine-tuning, i.e., to train the
model to build similar representations for pairs of words from translated
sentences. But such realignment methods were found to not always improve
results across languages and tasks, which raises the question of whether
aligned representations are truly beneficial for cross-lingual transfer. We
provide evidence that alignment is actually significantly correlated with
cross-lingual transfer across languages, models and random seeds. We show that
fine-tuning can have a significant impact on alignment, depending mainly on the
downstream task and the model. Finally, we show that realignment can, in some
instances, improve cross-lingual transfer, and we identify conditions in which
realignment methods provide significant improvements. Namely, we find that
realignment works better on tasks for which alignment is correlated with
cross-lingual transfer when generalizing to a distant language and with smaller
models, as well as when using a bilingual dictionary rather than FastAlign to
extract realignment pairs. For example, for POS-tagging, between English and
Arabic, realignment can bring a +15.8 accuracy improvement on distilmBERT, even
outperforming XLM-R Large by 1.7. We thus advocate for further research on

probability density function fit to the age distribution of the seismically
constrained models. Results. We estimate the age of Trumpler 10 to be
$30_{-20}{+30}$ Myr, and that of Praesepe to be $580 \pm 230$ Myr. In this
latter case, we find two apparent populations of $\delta$ Sct stars in the same
cluster, one at $510 \pm 140$ Myr and another at $890 \pm 140$ Myr. This may be
due to two different formation events, different rotational velocities of the
members in our sample of stars (as rapid rotation may modify the observed large
separation), or to membership of unresolved binary systems.

face several challenges that limit their usefulness in clinical practice.
Objective: To investigate the impact of multiple real-world dermoscopic views
of a single lesion of interest on a CNN-based melanoma classifier.
  Methods: This study evaluated 656 suspected melanoma lesions. Classifier
performance was measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC), expected calibration error (ECE) and maximum confidence change
(MCC) for (I) a single-view scenario, (II) a multiview scenario using multiple
artificially modified images per lesion and (III) a multiview scenario with
multiple real-world images per lesion.
  Results: The multiview approach with real-world images significantly
increased the AUROC from 0.905 (95% CI, 0.879-0.929) in the single-view
approach to 0.930 (95% CI, 0.909-0.951). ECE and MCC also improved
significantly from 0.131 (95% CI, 0.105-0.159) to 0.072 (95% CI: 0.052-0.093)
and from 0.149 (95% CI, 0.125-0.171) to 0.115 (95% CI: 0.099-0.131),
respectively. Comparing multiview real-world to artificially modified images
showed comparable diagnostic accuracy and uncertainty estimation, but
significantly worse robustness for the latter.
  Conclusion: Using multiple real-world images is an inexpensive method to
positively impact the performance of a CNN-based melanoma classifier.

dosimetry using the neutron activation method. It is worth noting that the
uncertainty in cross sections is the major source of uncertainty in
calculational predictions using nuclear data in simulations thus, cross section
validation is a key issue in any aims for refinement of any predictions. A
small compact neutron generator is a promising tool for performing integral
experiments and even for differential experiments. This paper deals with the
measurement of the differential dosimetry cross sections using a small compact
D-T neutron generator with 14.05 MeV neutron emission (10E8 n/s into 4pi).
Achieving measurable activation at such a low flux field is allowed by using a
larger amount of activation material placed in close measurement geometry
during decay gamma measurement. The experimentally determined cross sections
are in good agreement with the cross sections in the IRDFF-II dosimetry
library. The comparison with other nuclear data libraries was performed as
well. Its worth noting, the mean standard deviation in IRDFF-II library is
about 4 %, while in case of other data libraries they are from 5.5 % - 7.5 %.
This result can be understood as a validation of IRDFF-II using 14.05 MeV
neutrons and also a confirmation of the applicability of small compact
generators in the measurement of activation cross sections.

In this paper, a non-Hermitian three-dimensional metamaterial near the EP with

conventional non-Hermitian system, this metamaterial system is constructed with
a loss-assisted unique design. By tuning the anisotropic radiation loss between
split ring resonator (SRR) in the meta-atoms, extremely asymmetric absorption
and reflection unique to EPs are observed. This phenomenon is verified
theoretically and experimentally where the theoretical framework of
non-Hermitian physics is utilized to explain the formation of EP in the system.
By linking the equivalent circuit model (ECM) with the Hamiltonian quantum
physical model, a non-Hermitian transmission matrix is constructed. Finally, an

synthetic dimension that the conventional equivalent circuit theory can be
utilized to construct non-Hermitian systems. Our work lays down the way for the

spatiotemporal transportation services such as ride-sharing and freight
transport. Most existing region generation methods are manually specified

inflexibility to meet service operation requirements. In this paper, we propose
RegionGen, a data-driven region generation framework that can specify regions
with key characteristics (e.g., good spatial semantic meaning and
predictability) by modeling region generation as a multi-objective optimization
problem. First, to obtain good spatial semantic meaning, RegionGen segments the
whole city into atomic spatial elements based on road networks and obstacles
(e.g., rivers). Then, it clusters the atomic spatial elements into regions by
maximizing various operation characteristics, which is formulated as a
multi-objective optimization problem. For this optimization problem, we propose
a multi-objective co-optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments verify that
RegionGen can generate more suitable regions than traditional methods for
spatiotemporal service management.

model's behaviour on a given machine learning problem. For example, while the
quality of a model is commonly determined by the average loss assessed on a
testing set, this quantity does not reflect the existence of the true mean of
the loss distribution. Indeed, the finiteness of the statistical moments of the
loss distribution is related to the thickness of its tails, which are generally
unknown. Since typical cross-validation schemes determine a family of testing
loss distributions conditioned on the training samples, the total loss
distribution must be recovered by marginalizing over the space of training
sets. As we show in this work, the finiteness of the sampling procedure
negatively affects the reliability and efficiency of classical tail estimation
methods from the Extreme Value Theory, such as the Peaks-Over-Threshold
approach. In this work we tackle this issue by developing a novel general
theory for estimating the tails of marginal distributions, when there exists a
large variability between locations of the individual conditional distributions
underlying the marginal. To this end, we demonstrate that under some regularity
conditions, the shape parameter of the marginal distribution is the maximum
tail shape parameter of the family of conditional distributions. We term this
estimation approach as Cross Tail Estimation (CTE). We test cross-tail

if it is algebraically coherent, and it is also known that (both) these

  Our first aim is to separate them, by giving examples of action accessible

commutative associative algebras, of Jacobi-Jordan algebras and of
anti-commutative anti-associative algebras (over a field of characteristic
different from 2) are such. Thus we answer a question asked by George

selectively learn features in respective levels of abstraction. The performance
of this approach is examined regarding compression errors, pixelation and
random noise. An improvement in text extraction quality with a reduced error
rate of up to 53.9% on the synthetic data is archived. The pretrained

language processing, which relies on representations generated by pre-trained

of our work, which is highly compatible with statistical models such as PLMs.
Then a HyCxG framework is proposed to enhance language representation through a
three-stage solution. First, all constructions are extracted from sentences via
a slot-constraints approach. As constructions can overlap with each other,
bringing redundancy and imbalance, we formulate the conditional max coverage

discovery), aiming to identify causal relationships among variables, is a
fundamental task in machine learning. The recent invention of differentiable
score-based DAG learners is a crucial enabler, which reframes the combinatorial
optimization problem into a differentiable optimization with a DAG constraint
over directed graph space. Despite their great success, these cutting-edge DAG
learners incorporate DAG-ness independent score functions to evaluate the
directed graph candidates, lacking in considering graph structure. As a result,
measuring the data fitness alone regardless of DAG-ness inevitably leads to
discovering suboptimal DAGs and model vulnerabilities. Towards this end, we
propose a dynamic causal space for DAG structure learning, coined CASPER, that
integrates the graph structure into the score function as a new measure in the
causal space to faithfully reflect the causal distance between estimated and
ground truth DAG. CASPER revises the learning process as well as enhances the
DAG structure learning via adaptive attention to DAG-ness. Grounded by
empirical visualization, CASPER, as a space, satisfies a series of desired
properties, such as structure awareness and noise robustness. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets clearly validate the
superiority of our CASPER over the state-of-the-art causal discovery methods in
terms of accuracy and robustness.

Existing sparse gates are prone to convergence and performance issues when
training with first-order optimization methods. In this paper, we introduce two
improvements to current MoE approaches. First, we propose a new sparse gate:
COMET, which relies on a novel tree-based mechanism. COMET is differentiable,
can exploit sparsity to speed up computation, and outperforms state-of-the-art
gates. Second, due to the challenging combinatorial nature of sparse expert
selection, first-order methods are typically prone to low-quality solutions. To
deal with this challenge, we propose a novel, permutation-based local search
method that can complement first-order methods in training any sparse gate,
e.g., Hash routing, Top-k, DSelect-k, and COMET. We show that local search can
help networks escape bad initializations or solutions. We performed large-scale
experiments on various domains, including recommender systems, vision, and
natural language processing. On standard vision and recommender systems
benchmarks, COMET+ (COMET with local search) achieves up to 13% improvement in
ROC AUC over popular gates, e.g., Hash routing and Top-k, and up to 9% over
prior differentiable gates e.g., DSelect-k. When Top-k and Hash gates are
combined with local search, we see up to $100\times$ reduction in the budget
needed for hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, for language modeling, our approach
improves over the state-of-the-art MoEBERT model for distilling BERT on 5/7

(MM-DAGs), which are commonly observed in complex systems, e.g., traffic,
manufacturing, and weather systems, whose variables are multi-modal with
scalars, vectors, and functions. This paper takes the traffic congestion
analysis as a concrete case, where a traffic intersection is usually regarded
as a DAG. In a road network of multiple intersections, different intersections
can only have some overlapping and distinct variables observed. For example, a
signalized intersection has traffic light-related variables, whereas
unsignalized ones do not. This encourages the multi-task design: with each DAG
as a task, the MM-DAG tries to learn the multiple DAGs jointly so that their
consensus and consistency are maximized. To this end, we innovatively propose a
multi-modal regression for linear causal relationship description of different
variables. Then we develop a novel Causality Difference (CD) measure and its
differentiable approximator. Compared with existing SOTA measures, CD can
penalize the causal structural difference among DAGs with distinct nodes and
can better consider the uncertainty of causal orders. We rigidly prove our
design's topological interpretation and consistency properties. We conduct
thorough simulations and one case study to show the effectiveness of our
MM-DAG. The code is available under https://github.com/Lantian72/MM-DAG

probability of an unstable condition being included in the estimate is
independent of the system's complexity, while convergence in probability to the
true region of attraction is proven. Numerical examples demonstrate the
effectiveness for optimization-based control applications. Combining systems
theory and sampling, the complexity of Monte--Carlo-based verification

is a fundamental quantity that can be used in evaluation and validation of
nuclear data. Many experiments focused on the determination of Spectrum
Averaged Cross Sections (SACS) in 235U(nth,f). Prompt Fission Neutron Spectrum
(PFNS) in light water reactors using enriched uranium fuel. In these reactors,
there is already some amount of water moderator between the uranium fuel and
the irradiated sample. Due to the decrease of hydrogen cross-section with
neutron energy, the high energy tail of the reactor spectrum in cores with
water moderator may be harder than the pure PFNS. This paper aims to compare
the shape of the actual reactor spectrum in various core positions of a
research light-water reactor differing each from other by the effective water
thickness. The spectrum shape is determined both by calculations and
experimentally using various high energy threshold reactions. The impact of the
photo-nuclear reactions ({\gamma},n) competing with (n,2n) in production of the
same residual nucleus was shown to be less than a percent for most of studied
dosimeters. An important exception was found for 197Au(n,2n) 196Au dosimeter
irradiated in the outcore channel where a notable photo-neutron contribution to
the production of 196Au is caused by the neutron production from the high
energy {\gamma}-rays from thermal-neutron capture in 54Fe. The corresponding
ENDF/B-VIII.0 data turned out to underestimate such {\gamma}-yield by 40% in

was attributed to the underestimation of the evaluated cross section

This rigorously rules out the possibility of implementing well-known quantum

services via natural language conversations. Although a number of approaches
have been proposed for developing capable CRSs, they typically rely on
sufficient training data for training. Since it is difficult to annotate
recommendation-oriented dialogue datasets, existing CRS approaches often suffer
from the issue of insufficient training due to the scarcity of training data.
To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a CounterFactual data
simulation approach for CRS, named CFCRS, to alleviate the issue of data
scarcity in CRSs. Our approach is developed based on the framework of
counterfactual data augmentation, which gradually incorporates the rewriting to
the user preference from a real dialogue without interfering with the entire
conversation flow. To develop our approach, we characterize user preference and
organize the conversation flow by the entities involved in the dialogue, and
design a multi-stage recommendation dialogue simulator based on a conversation
flow language model. Under the guidance of the learned user preference and
dialogue schema, the flow language model can produce reasonable, coherent
conversation flows, which can be further realized into complete dialogues.
Based on the simulator, we perform the intervention at the representations of
the interacted entities of target users, and design an adversarial training
method with a curriculum schedule that can gradually optimize the data
augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our approach can
consistently boost the performance of several competitive CRSs, and outperform
other data augmentation methods, especially when the training data is limited.

PLBF requires a $O(N^3k)$ time complexity to construct the data structure,
where $N$ and $k$ are the hyperparameters of PLBF. One can improve memory

stochastic mixed-integer programming problems with continuous recourse. This
paper introduces Two-Step Benders Decomposition with Scenario Clustering (TBDS)
as a general exact solution methodology for solving such stochastic programs to
optimality. The method combines and generalizes Benders dual decomposition,
partial Benders decomposition, and Scenario Clustering techniques and does so
within a novel two-step decomposition along the binary and continuous
first-stage decisions. We use TBDS to provide the first exact solutions for the
so-called Time Window Assignment Traveling Salesperson problem. This is a
canonical optimization problem for service-oriented vehicle routing; it
considers jointly assigning time windows to customers and routing a vehicle
among them while travel times are stochastic. Extensive experiments show that
TBDS is superior to state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. It solves
instances with up to 25 customers to optimality. It provides better lower and
upper bounds that lead to faster convergence than related methods. For example,
Benders dual decomposition cannot solve instances of 10 customers to
optimality. We use TBDS to analyze the structure of the optimal solutions. By
increasing routing costs only slightly, customer service can be improved
tremendously, driven by smartly alternating between high- and low-variance
travel arcs to reduce the impact of delay propagation throughout the executed
vehicle route.

stellar objects (YSOs). If this early evolution were confirmed, it would impact
the usually assumed initial conditions of planet formation, where only

protostellar envelopes. We aim to determine the maximum grain size of the dust
population in the envelope of the Class 0/I protostar L1527 IRS, located in the
Taurus star-forming region (140 pc). We use Atacama Large
millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) archival
data and present new observations, in an effort to both enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio of the faint extended continuum emission and properly
account for the compact emission from the inner disc. Using observations
performed in four wavelength bands and extending the spatial range of previous
studies, we aim to place tight constraints on the spectral ($\alpha$) and dust
emissivity ($\beta$) indices in the envelope of L1527 IRS. We find a rather
flat $\alpha \sim$ 3.0 profile in the range 50-2000 au. Accounting for the
envelope temperature profile, we derive values for the dust emissivity index,
0.9 < $\beta$ < 1.6, and reveal a tentative, positive outward gradient. This
could be interpreted as a distribution of mainly ISM-like grains at 2000 au,
gradually progressing to (sub-)millimetre-sized dust grains in the inner
envelope, where at R=300 au, $\beta$ = 1.1 +/- 0.1. Our study supports a
variation of the dust properties in the envelope of L1527 IRS. We discuss how
this can be the result of in-situ grain growth, dust differential collapse from
the parent core, or upward transport of disc large grains.

representation degradation in contrastive learning. However, there are still a
mass of appearance similarities between positive pair constructed by the
existing methods, which inhibits the further representation improvement. In
this paper, we propose a novel asymmetric patch sampling strategy for
contrastive learning, to further boost the appearance asymmetry for better
representations. Specifically, dual patch sampling strategies are applied to
the given image, to obtain asymmetric positive pairs. First, sparse patch
sampling is conducted to obtain the first view, which reduces spatial
redundancy of image and allows a more asymmetric view. Second, a selective
patch sampling is proposed to construct another view with large appearance
discrepancy relative to the first one. Due to the inappreciable appearance
similarity between positive pair, the trained model is encouraged to capture
the similarity on semantics, instead of low-level ones. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the existing
self-supervised methods on both ImageNet-1K and CIFAR dataset, e.g., 2.5%
finetune accuracy improvement on CIFAR100. Furthermore, our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks, object detection and instance

our method is more efficient on both memory and computation during training.

bursts. We detected 1955 single pulses from RRAT J1913+1330 using the 19-beam
receiver of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST).
These pulses were detected in 19 distinct clusters, with 49.4% of them
occurring sequentially with a waiting time of one rotation period. The energy
distribution of these individual pulses exhibited a wide range, spanning three
orders of magnitude, reminiscent of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs).
Furthermore, we observed abrupt variations in pulse profile, width, peak flux,
and fluence between adjacent sequential pulses. These findings suggest that
this RRAT could be interpreted as pulsars with extreme pulse-to-pulse
modulation. The presence of sequential pulse trains during active phases, along
with significant pulse variations in profile, fluence, flux, and width, should
be intrinsic to a subset of RRATs. Our results indicate that J1913+1330
represents a peculiar source that shares certain properties with populations of
nulling pulsars, giant pulses, and FRBs from different perspectives. The
dramatic pulse-to-pulse variation observed in J1913+1330 could be attributed to
unstable pair creation above the polar cap region and the variation of the site
where streaming pairs emit coherently. Exploring a larger sample of RRATs

feature, encodes rich health information. We aim to show that, a high-quality
automatic sleep stage scoring based on a proper quantification of BPV
extracting from the single airflow signal can be achieved.
  Methods: Topological data analysis (TDA) is applied to characterize BPV from
the intrinsically nonstationary airflow signal, where the extracted features
are used to train an automatic sleep stage scoring model using the XGBoost
learner. The noise and artifacts commonly present in the airflow signal are
recycled to enhance the performance of the trained system. The state-of-the-art
approach is implemented for a comparison.
  Results: When applied to 30 whole night polysomnogram signals with standard
annotations, the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation shows that the proposed
features (overall accuracy 78.8\%$\pm$8.7\% and Cohen's kappa 0.56$\pm 0.15$)
outperforms those considered in the state-of-the-art work (overall accuracy
75.0\%$\pm$9.6\% and Cohen's kappa 0.50$\pm 0.15$) when applied to
automatically score wake, rapid eyeball movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM). The
TDA features are shown to contain complementary information to the traditional
features commonly used in the literature via examining the feature importance.
The respiratory quality index is found to be essential in the trained system.
  Conclusion: The proposed TDA-assisted automatic annotation system can
accurately distinguish wake, REM and NREM from the airflow signal.
  Significance: Since only one single airflow channel is needed and BPV is
universal, the result suggests that the TDA-assisted signal processing has
potential to be applied to other biomedical signals and homecare problems other
than the sleep stage annotation.

adopted, boosting is typically used in supervised learning where the data is

data is labeled through weak and noisy sources, it remains nontrivial to design
effective boosting approaches. In this work, we show that the standard
implementation of the convex combination of base learners can hardly work due
to the presence of noisy labels. Instead, we propose $\textit{LocalBoost}$, a
novel framework for weakly-supervised boosting. LocalBoost iteratively boosts
the ensemble model from two dimensions, i.e., intra-source and inter-source.
The intra-source boosting introduces locality to the base learners and enables
each base learner to focus on a particular feature regime by training new base
learners on granularity-varying error regions. For the inter-source boosting,
we leverage a conditional function to indicate the weak source where the sample
is more likely to appear. To account for the weak labels, we further design an
estimate-then-modify approach to compute the model weights. Experiments on

  Actor-Critic",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Learning high-quality Q-value functions plays a key role in the success of
many modern off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Previous
works focus on addressing the value overestimation issue, an outcome of
adopting function approximators and off-policy learning. Deviating from the
common viewpoint, we observe that Q-values are indeed underestimated in the
latter stage of the RL training process, primarily related to the use of
inferior actions from the current policy in Bellman updates as compared to the
more optimal action samples in the replay buffer. We hypothesize that this
long-neglected phenomenon potentially hinders policy learning and reduces
sample efficiency. Our insight to address this issue is to incorporate
sufficient exploitation of past successes while maintaining exploration
optimism. We propose the Blended Exploitation and Exploration (BEE) operator, a
simple yet effective approach that updates Q-value using both historical
best-performing actions and the current policy. The instantiations of our
method in both model-free and model-based settings outperform state-of-the-art
methods in various continuous control tasks and achieve strong performance in
failure-prone scenarios and real-world robot tasks.

architectures in learning functions with group symmetries. In contrary to
equivariant architectures, we use an arbitrary base model (such as an MLP or a

employing a small equivariant network that parameterizes the probabilistic
distribution underlying the symmetrization. The distribution is end-to-end
trained with the base model which can maximize performance while reducing
sample complexity of symmetrization. We show that this approach ensures not
only equivariance to given group but also universal approximation capability in
expectation. We implement our method on a simple patch-based transformer that
can be initialized from pretrained vision transformers, and test it for a wide
range of symmetry groups including permutation and Euclidean groups and their
combinations. Empirical tests show competitive results against tailored
equivariant architectures, suggesting the potential for learning equivariant
functions for diverse groups using a non-equivariant universal base
architecture. We further show evidence of enhanced learning in symmetric
modalities, like graphs, when pretrained from non-symmetric modalities, like
vision. Our implementation will be open-sourced at

sufficient enough to pre-train a transformer network for retrieval and hence
propose various tasks to do so. Intrigued by those novel methods, we noticed
that all these models used different finetuning protocols, making it hard to
assess the benefits of middle training. We propose in this paper a benchmark of
CoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE, under the same finetuning conditions. We
compare both dense and sparse approaches under various finetuning protocols and
middle training on different collections (MS MARCO, Wikipedia or Tripclick). We
use additional middle training baselines, such as a standard MLM finetuning on
the retrieval collection, optionally augmented by a CLS predicting the passage
term frequency. For the sparse approach, our study reveals that there is almost
no statistical difference between those methods: the more effective the
finetuning procedure is, the less difference there is between those models. For
the dense approach, RetroMAE using MS MARCO as middle-training collection shows
excellent results in almost all the settings. Finally, we show that middle
training on the retrieval collection, thus adapting the language model to it,
is a critical factor. Overall, a better experimental setup should be adopted to

but not physical-world entities -- are immune from lawsuits related to content
authored by their users or customers. As a result, online entities have been
able to avoid claims for harms caused by their negligence and defective product
designs simply because they operate online.
  The reason for the disparate treatment is the internet's dramatic evolution
over the last two decades. The internet of 1996 served as an information
repository and communications channel and was well governed by Section 230,
which treats internet entities as another form of mass media: Because Facebook,
Twitter and other online companies could not possibly review the mass of
content that flows through their systems, Section 230 immunizes them from
claims related to user content. But content distribution is not the internet's
only function, and it is even less so now than it was in 1996. The internet
also operates as a platform for the delivery of real-world goods and services
and requires a correspondingly diverse immunity doctrine. This Article proposes
refining online immunity by limiting it to claims that threaten to impose a
content-moderation burden on internet defendants. Where a claim is preventable
other than by content moderation -- for example, by redesigning an app or
website -- a plaintiff could freely seek relief, just as in the physical world.
This approach empowers courts to identify culpable actors in the virtual world

example, SNR-driven shocks may form new molecular gas or compress pre-existing
clouds and trigger the formation of new stars. To test this scenario, we
measure the deuteration of $N_2H^+$, $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$, a well-studied tracer
of pre-stellar cores, across the Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) G034.77-00.55,
known to be experiencing a shock interaction with the SNR W44. We use
N$_2$H$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$ J=1-0 single pointing observations obtained with the
30m antenna at the Instituto de Radioastronomia Millimetrica to infer
$D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ toward five positions across the cloud, namely a massive
core, different regions across the shock front, a dense clump and ambient gas.
We find $D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ in the range 0.03-0.1, several orders of magnitude
larger than the cosmic D/H ratio ($\sim$10$^{-5}$). Across the shock front,
$D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$ is enhanced by more than a factor of 2
($D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}\sim$0.05-0.07) with respect to the ambient gas ($\leq$0.03)
and similar to that measured generally in pre-stellar cores. Indeed, in the
massive core and dense clump regions of this IRDC we measure
$D_{frac}^{N_2H^+}$}$\sim$0.1. We find enhanced deuteration of $N_2H^+$ across
the region of the shock, at a level that is enhanced with respect to regions of
unperturbed gas. It is possible that this has been induced by shock
compression, which would then be indirect evidence that the shock is triggering
conditions for future star formation. However, since unperturbed dense regions
also show elevated levels of deuteration, further, higher-resolution studies
are needed to better understand the structure and kinematics of the deuterated
material in the shock region, e.g., if it still in relatively diffuse form or
already organised in a population of low-mass pre-stellar cores.

accuracy of an SVDE method hugely depends on the diversity and volume of the

reconstruction are typically small, synthetic datasets are not photorealistic
enough, and all these datasets lack diversity. The large-scale and diverse data
can be sourced from stereo images or stereo videos from the web. Typically
being uncalibrated, stereo data provides disparities up to unknown shift
(geometrically incomplete data), so stereo-trained SVDE methods cannot recover
3D geometry. It was recently shown that the distorted point clouds obtained
with a stereo-trained SVDE method can be corrected with additional point cloud

contrary, we propose GP$^{2}$, General-Purpose and Geometry-Preserving training

(SIMO) model that can generate multiple enhanced images from a single lowlight

from a pool of enhanced images. Human subjective analysis of SIMO results shows
that the distribution of preferred images varies, endorsing the importance of
SIMO-type models. Lastly, we propose a low-light road scene (LLRS) dataset

fixed camera settings. Exhaustive comparisons on publicly available datasets,
and the proposed dataset reveal that the results of our model outperform prior

non-deterministic physical phenomena that can be well described by classical
physics. The stochastic processes we are interested in are akin to Brownian
Motion and can be described by an overdamped Langevin equation comprised of a
deterministic drift term and a random noise term. In Part I we examine
stochastic processes in the Mesoscale. For us this means that the Langevin
equation is driven by thermal noise, with amplitude proportional to the
temperature $T$ and there exists a genuine equilibrium thermal state. We apply
a technique known as the Functional Renormalisation Group (FRG) which allows us
to coarse-grain in temporal scales. We describe how to obtain effective
equations of motion for the 1- and 2-point functions of a particle evolving in
highly non-trivial potentials and verify their accuracy by comparison to direct
numerical simulations. In this way we outline a novel procedure for describing
the behaviour of stochastic processes without having to resort to time
consuming numerical simulations. In Part II we turn to the Early Universe and
in particular examine stochastic processes occurring during a period of
accelerated expansion known as inflation. This inflationary period is driven by
a scalar field called the inflaton which also obeys a Langevin equation in the
Stochastic Inflation formalism. We use this to study the formation of
Primordial Black Holes during a period of Ultra Slow-Roll. We finish this
thesis by applying the techniques developed in Part I to a spectator field
during inflation. FRG techniques can compute cosmologically relevant
observables such as the power spectrum and spectral tilt. We also extend the
FRG formalism to solve first-passage time problems and verify that it gives the
correct prediction for the average time taken for a field (or particle) to
overcome a barrier in the potential.

the following: (1) a novel convolutional operator called Faster Fourier
Convolution (FasterFC) to replace the two consecutive convolution operations
typically used in convolutional neural networks (e.g., U-Net, ResNet). Based on
the spectral convolution theorem in Fourier theory, FasterFC employs
alternating kernels of size 1 in 3D case) in different domains to extend the
dual-domain receptive field to the global and achieves faster calculation speed
than traditional Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC). (2) A 2D accelerated MRI
method, FasterFC-End-to-End-VarNet, which uses FasterFC to improve the
sensitivity maps and reconstruction quality. (3) A multi-stage 3D accelerated
MRI method called FasterFC-based Single-to-group Network (FAS-Net) that
utilizes a single-to-group algorithm to guide k-space domain reconstruction,
followed by FasterFC-based cascaded convolutional neural networks to expand the
effective receptive field in the dual-domain. Experimental results on the

set of functional dependencies. The entropy value represents the likelihood of
inferring the cell's value based on the dependencies and the remaining tuples.
By highlighting cells with lower entropy, we effectively visualize redundancies

that a straightforward approach is insufficient for handling practical problem

prove to be correct. Additionally, we present a Monte Carlo approximation

fundamentally asymmetric cost: queries detected as ""bad"" come at a higher cost
because they trigger additional security filters, e.g., usage throttling or

large number of ""bad"" queries, which likely renders them ineffective against
security-critical systems. We then design new attacks that reduce the number of
bad queries by $1.5$-$7.3\times$, but often at a significant increase in total

step for the downstream tractography and connectivity analyses. With recent
advantages in data sharing, large-scale multi-site DW-MRI datasets are being

model-based methods (e.g., constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD)) and
learning based methods (e.g., deep learning (DL)) do not explicitly consider

wireless access networks for the battery-constrained Internet of Things (IoT)

problem is finding the location of devices carried by a lost person. However,
using a LoRa-based IoT network for SAR operations will have a limited coverage
caused by high signal attenuation due to the terrestrial blockages especially
in highly remote areas. To overcome this challenge, the use of unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) as a flying LoRa gateway to transfer messages from ground LoRa
nodes to the ground rescue station can be a promising solution. In this paper,
the problem of the flying LoRa (FL) gateway control in the search-and-rescue
system using the UAV-assisted LoRa network is modeled as a partially observable
Markov decision process. Then, a deep meta-RL-based policy is proposed to
control the FL gateway trajectory during SAR operation. For initialization of
proposed deep meta-RL-based policy, first, a deep RL-based policy is designed
to determine the adaptive FL gateway trajectory in a fixed search environment
including a fixed radio geometry. Then, as a general solution, a deep meta-RL
framework is used for SAR in any new and unknown environments to integrate the
prior FL gateway experience with information collected from the other search
environments and rapidly adapt the SAR policy model for SAR operation in a new
environment. The proposed UAV-assisted LoRa network is then experimentally
designed and implemented. Practical evaluation results show that if the deep
meta-RL based control policy is applied instead of the deep RL-based one, the
number of SAR time slots decreases from 141 to 50.

underlying mapping from clean to underwater images is one-to-many, resulting in
an inaccurate constraint on the cycle consistency loss. To address these

unpaired data. Our model disentangles haze and content information from
underwater images using a Haze Disentanglement Network (HDN). The disentangled
content is used by a restoration network to generate a clean image using
adversarial losses. The disentangled haze is then used as a guide for
underwater image regeneration resulting in a strong constraint on cycle
consistency loss and improved performance gains. Different ablation studies
show that the haze and content from underwater images are effectively

nature due to small adsorption energy, charge transfer, and long adsorption
distance. It is found that both N-vacancy defected GaN-ML and Fe-doped GaN-ML
can significantly increase the adsorption energy and charge transfer for CO.
The CO adsorption induces the metallic characteristics of N-vacancy GaN-ML to
be converted to the half-metallic characteristics together with 100% spin
polarization, and it also drastically changes the magnetic moment, implying
that N-vacancy GaN-ML exhibits excellent sensitivity to CO. However, Fe-doped
GaN-ML is not conducive to CO detection. Moreover, N-vacancy defected and
Pt-doped GaN-ML greatly improve the adsorption ability for NO compared to other

tidal forces from the star have eroded planets' obliquities and synchronized
their rotation rates. These rotation vectors may be tracers of formation and
evolution histories and also enable a range of atmospheric circulation states.
Here we delineate the orbital space over which tidal synchronization and
alignment assumptions may no longer apply and present three-dimensional
atmospheric models of a hypothetical warm Jupiter over a range of rotation
rates and obliquities. We simulate the secondary eclipses of this planet for
different possible viewing orientations and times during its orbital, seasonal
cycle. We find that the eclipse depth can be strongly influenced by rotation
rate and obliquity through the timing of the eclipse relative to the planet's
seasonal cycle, and advise caution in attempting to derive properties such as
albedo or day-night transport from this measurement. We predict that if warm
Jupiters beyond the tidal limit have intrinsic diversity in their rotation
vectors, then it will manifest itself as dispersion in their secondary eclipse
depths. We explore eclipse mapping as a way to uniquely constrain the rotation
vector of warm Jupiters but find that the associated signals are likely at the
edge of JWST performance. Nevertheless, as JWST begins to measure the secondary
eclipses of longer orbital period planets, we should expect to observe the
consequences of a wider range of rotation states and circulation patterns.

However, in many real scenarios, due to the lack of medical knowledge, it is
usually difficult for patients to determine clear goals with all necessary
slots. In this paper, we identify this challenge as how to construct medical
consultation dialogue systems to help patients clarify their goals. To mitigate
this challenge, we propose a novel task and create a human-to-human mixed-type
medical consultation dialogue corpus, termed MidMed, covering five dialogue
types: task-oriented dialogue for diagnosis, recommendation, knowledge-grounded
dialogue, QA, and chitchat. MidMed covers four departments
(otorhinolaryngology, ophthalmology, skin, and digestive system), with 8,175
dialogues. Furthermore, we build baselines on MidMed and propose an
instruction-guiding medical dialogue generation framework, termed InsMed, to
address this task. Experimental results show the effectiveness of InsMed.

operator for linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The Green's function
is well-sought after due to its ability to directly map inputs to solutions,
bypassing the need for common numerical methods such as finite difference and
finite elements methods. However, obtaining an explicit form of the Green's
function kernel for most PDEs has been a challenge due to the Dirac delta
function singularity present. To address this issue, we propose the Deep
Generalized Green's Function (DGGF) as an alternative, which can be solved for
in an efficient and accurate manner using neural network models. The DGGF
provides a more efficient and precise approach to solving linear PDEs while
inheriting the reusability of the Green's function, and possessing additional
desirable properties such as mesh-free operation and a small memory footprint.
The DGGF is compared against a variety of state-of-the-art (SOTA) PDE solvers,
including direct methods, namely physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
Green's function approaches such as networks for Gaussian approximation of the
Dirac delta functions (GADD), and numerical Green's functions (NGFs). The
performance of all methods is compared on four representative PDE categories,
each with different combinations of dimensionality and domain shape. The
results confirm the advantages of DGGFs, and benefits of Generalized Greens
Functions as an novel alternative approach to solve PDEs without suffering from
singularities.

it is not possible to infer which one causes the other. Much of the causal
literature has focused on guaranteeing identifiability of causal direction in
statistical models for datasets where strong assumptions hold, such as additive
noise or restrictions on parameter count. These methods are then subsequently
tested on realistic datasets, most of which violate their assumptions. Building
on previous attempts, we show how to use causal assumptions within the Bayesian
framework. This allows us to specify models with realistic assumptions, while
also encoding independent causal mechanisms, leading to an asymmetry between
the causal directions. Identifying causal direction then becomes a Bayesian
model selection problem. We analyse why Bayesian model selection works for
known identifiable cases and flexible model classes, while also providing
correctness guarantees about its behaviour. To demonstrate our approach, we
construct a Bayesian non-parametric model that can flexibly model the joint. We
then outperform previous methods on a wide range of benchmark datasets with

folding and activation of client proteins using the free energy of ATP
hydrolysis. The Hsp90 active site is in its N-terminal domain (NTD). Our goal
is to characterize the dynamics of NTD using an autoencoder-learned collective
variable (CV) in conjunction with adaptive biasing force (ABF) Langevin
dynamics. Using dihedral analysis, we cluster all available experimental Hsp90
NTD structures into distinct native states. We then perform unbiased molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations to construct a dataset that represents each state and
use this dataset to train an autoencoder. Two autoencoder architectures are
considered, with one and two hidden layers respectively, and bottlenecks of
dimension $k$ ranging from 1 to 10. We demonstrate that the addition of an
extra hidden layer does not significantly improve the performance, while it
leads to complicated CVs that increases the computational cost of biased MD
calculations. In addition, a 2D bottleneck can provide enough information of
the different states, while the optimal bottleneck dimension is five. For the
2D bottleneck, the two-dimensional CV is directly used in biased MD
simulations. For the 5D bottleneck, we perform an analysis of the latent CV
space and identify the pair of CV coordinates that best separates the states of
Hsp90. Interestingly, selecting a 2D CV out of the 5D CV space leads to better
results than directly learning a 2D CV, and allows to observe transitions
between native states when running free energy biased dynamics.

determinism within gravitational singularities, showcasing the ability to
uniquely extend Einstein's equations across the singularity in certain
symmetry-reduced models. This extension can be achieved by allowing the
orientation of spatial hypersurfaces to dynamically change. Furthermore, a
crucial aspect of the analysis revolves around the formulation of the dynamical
equations in terms of physical degrees of freedom, demonstrating their
regularity at the singularity. Remarkably, singular behavior is found to be
confined solely to the gauge/unphysical degrees of freedom. This paper extends
these results to gravity coupled with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields in a
symmetry-reduced model (homogeneous anisotropic universe). Near the Big Bang,
the dynamics of the geometry and the gauge fields is reformulated in a way that
shows that determinism is preserved, assuming a change in orientation at the
singularity. The gauge fields are demonstrated to maintain their orientation
throughout the singularity, indicating that the predicted orientation change of
spatial hypersurfaces holds physical significance. This observation suggests
that an observer can discern the specific side of the Big Bang they inhabit.

environments limits the applicability of neural networks to real-world tasks.
This issue is critical in practical supervised learning settings, such as the
ones in which a pre-trained model computes projections toward a latent space
where different task predictors are sequentially learned over time. As a matter
of fact, incrementally fine-tuning the whole model to better adapt to new tasks
usually results in catastrophic forgetting, with decreasing performance over
the past experiences and losing valuable knowledge from the pre-training stage.
In this paper, we propose a novel strategy to make the fine-tuning procedure
more effective, by avoiding to update the pre-trained part of the network and
learning not only the usual classification head, but also a set of
newly-introduced learnable parameters that are responsible for transforming the
input data. This process allows the network to effectively leverage the
pre-training knowledge and find a good trade-off between plasticity and
stability with modest computational efforts, thus especially suitable for
on-the-edge settings. Our experiments on four image classification problems in
a continual learning setting confirm the quality of the proposed approach when
compared to several fine-tuning procedures and to popular continual learning
methods.

machine learning models that can be used (along with assignment algorithms) to
match families to locations, with the goal of maximizing a policy-relevant
integration outcome such as employment status after a certain duration.
Existing implementations and research train models to predict the policy
outcome directly, and use these predictions in the assignment procedure.
However, the merits of this approach, particularly in non-stationary settings,
has not been previously explored. This study proposes and compares three
different modeling strategies: the standard approach described above, an
approach that uses newer data and proxy outcomes, and a hybrid approach. We
show that the hybrid approach is robust to both distribution shift and weak
proxy relationships -- the failure points of the other two methods,
respectively. We compare these approaches empirically using data on asylum
seekers in the Netherlands. Surprisingly, we find that both the proxy and
hybrid approaches out-perform the standard approach in practice. These insights
support the development of a real-world recommendation tool currently used by

To overcome this limitation, we propose a method (INDigo) that combines

arbitrary degradation process and use the inverse as a reconstruction process.
During the diffusion sampling process, we impose an additional data-consistency
step that minimizes the distance between the intermediate result and the
INN-optimized result at every iteration, where the INN-optimized image is
composed of the coarse information given by the observed degraded image and the
details generated by the diffusion process. With the help of INN, our algorithm
effectively estimates the details lost in the degradation process and is no

degradation model. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm obtains
competitive results compared with recently leading methods both quantitatively

better probability to observe subsequent transit events owing to its longer
uninterrupted time-series observations compared to the ground-based telescopes.
Especially, for the exoplanets around bright host-stars, TESS time-series
observations provides high SNR lightcurves, which can be used for higher
precision studies for these exoplanets. In this work, I have studied the TESS
transit photometric follow-up observations of 28 exoplanets around bright stars
with $V_{mag}\le$10. The already high SNR lightcurves from TESS have been
further processed with a critical noise treatment algorithm, using the wavelet
denoising and the Gaussian-process regression techniques, to effectively reduce
the noise components both correlated and uncorrelated in time, which were then
used to estimate the physical properties of these exoplanets. The study has
resulted in very precise values for the physical properties of the target
exoplanets, with the improvements in precision being significant for most of
the cases compared to the previous studies. Also, since a comparatively large
number of transit lightcurves from TESS observations were used to estimate
these physical properties for each of the target exoplanets, which removes any
bias due to the lack of sufficient datasets, these updated physical properties
can be considered extremely accurate and reliable for future studies.

binary activation function etc. Moreover, an additional data structure
""membrane potential"" responsible for keeping track of temporal information,
must be fetched and updated at every timestep in SNNs. To overcome these, we
propose a novel SNN-ANN hybrid architecture that combines the strengths of
both. Specifically, we leverage the asynchronous compute capabilities of SNN
layers to effectively extract the input temporal information. While the ANN
layers offer trouble-free training and implementation on standard machine
learning hardware such as GPUs. We provide extensive experimental analysis for
assigning each layer to be spiking or analog in nature, leading to a network
configuration optimized for performance and ease of training. We evaluate our
hybrid architectures for optical flow estimation using event-data on DSEC-flow
and Mutli-Vehicle Stereo Event-Camera (MVSEC) datasets. The results indicate
that our configured hybrid architectures outperform the state-of-the-art
ANN-only, SNN-only and past hybrid architectures both in terms of accuracy and
efficiency. Specifically, our hybrid architecture exhibit a 31% and 24.8% lower
average endpoint error (AEE) at 2.1x and 3.1x lower energy, compared to an
SNN-only architecture on DSEC and MVSEC datasets, respectively.

introduced by \citet{mannor2011} and received considerable attention in recent

for this problem is of order $\sqrt{\alpha T}$, where $\alpha$ is the
independence number of the graph, and $T$ is the time horizon. However, this is

mechanisms provides the opportunity to utilize both unlabeled speech and
speech-related visual information based on data availability. This has shown to
enhance the quality of learned representations, especially at encoding
semantic- and lexical-level knowledge. In this work, we further study the joint
optimization of wav2vec 2.0-based SSL and transformer-based VGS as a multi-task

speech representations are shared or transferred between the two tasks, and
what is the optimal training strategy for cross-modal semantic retrieval and
phoneme discrimination performance. As a result, we find that sequential
training with wav2vec 2.0 first and VGS next provides higher performance on
audio-visual retrieval compared to simultaneous optimization of both learning

catastrophic forgetting when switching between optimization criteria. Moreover,

symmetry $G$ of a theory in $(d+1)$D spacetime can yield an unconventional
critical point if the original theory has a continuous transition where
$\Gamma$ is completely spontaneously broken and if $G$ is a nontrivial
extension of $G/\Gamma$ by $\Gamma$. The gauged theory has symmetry $G/\Gamma
\times \hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$, where $\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$ is the $(d-1)$-form
dual symmetry of $\Gamma$, and a 't Hooft anomaly between them. Thus it can be
viewed as a boundary of a topological phase protected by $G/\Gamma \times
\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$. The ordinary critical point, upon gauging, is mapped to
a deconfined quantum critical point between two ordinary symmetry-breaking
phases ($d =1$) or an unconventional quantum critical point between an ordinary
symmetry-breaking phase and a topologically ordered phase ($d\ge 2$) associated
with $G/\Gamma$ and $\hat{\Gamma}^{(d-1)}$, respectively. Order parameters and

concrete example, we gauge the $\mathbb{z}_2$ subgroup of $\mathbb{z}_4$

Since the symmetry of the clock model contains $D_8$, the dihedral group of
order 8, we also analyze the anomaly structure which is similar to that in the
compactified $SU(2)$ gauge theory with $\theta =\pi$ in $(3+1)$D and its mixed

molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which finds widespread applications in

reaching chemical accuracy can require hundreds of frames of force and energy
labels generated by expensive quantum mechanical algorithms, which may scale as
$O(n^3)$ to $O(n^7)$, with $n$ proportional to the number of basis functions.
To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage computational framework --
ASTEROID, which lowers the data cost of MLFFs by leveraging a combination of
cheap inaccurate data and expensive accurate data. The motivation behind
ASTEROID is that inaccurate data, though incurring large bias, can help capture
the sophisticated structures of the underlying force field. Therefore, we first
train a MLFF model on a large amount of inaccurate training data, employing a
bias-aware loss function to prevent the model from overfitting tahe potential
bias of this data. We then fine-tune the obtained model using a small amount of
accurate training data, which preserves the knowledge learned from the
inaccurate training data while significantly improving the model's accuracy.
Moreover, we propose a variant of ASTEROID based on score matching for the
setting where the inaccurate training data are unlabeled. Extensive experiments
on MD datasets and downstream tasks validate the efficacy of ASTEROID. Our code

obtained with crowd-sourcing services. Multiple annotators each complete their
own small part of the annotations, where labeling mistakes that depend on
annotators occur frequently. Modeling the label-noise generation process by the
noise transition matrix is a power tool to tackle the label noise. In
real-world crowd-sourcing scenarios, noise transition matrices are both
annotator- and instance-dependent. However, due to the high complexity of
annotator- and instance-dependent transition matrices (AIDTM),
\textit{annotation sparsity}, which means each annotator only labels a little
part of instances, makes modeling AIDTM very challenging. Prior works simplify
the problem by assuming the transition matrix is instance-independent or using
simple parametric way, while lose modeling generality. Motivated by this, we
target a more realistic problem, estimating general AIDTM in practice. Without
losing modeling generality, we parameterize AIDTM with deep neural networks. To
alleviate the modeling challenge, we suppose every annotator shares its noise
pattern with similar annotators, and estimate AIDTM via \textit{knowledge
transfer}. We hence first model the mixture of noise patterns by all
annotators, and then transfer this modeling to individual annotators.
Furthermore, considering that the transfer from the mixture of noise patterns
to individuals may cause two annotators with highly different noise generations
to perturb each other, we employ the knowledge transfer between identified
neighboring annotators to calibrate the modeling. Experiments confirm the
superiority of the proposed approach on synthetic and real-world crowd-sourcing
data. Source codes will be released.

inhomogeneity, heat dissipation and correction terms are found responsible to
induce complexity within the self-gravitating objects. The scalar functions are
determined using Herrera's orthogonal splitting approach, which results in a
complexity factor that includes all of the system's essential features.
Furthermore, we investigate the dynamics of charged spherical distribution by
choosing homologous mode as the simplest evolutionary pattern. Dissipative and
non-dissipative cases associated with complexity free and homologous conditions
are also discussed. Finally, we study the components responsible for producing
complexity during the evolution process. We deduce that the inclusion of extra
curvature terms and charge in $f(G, T)$ gravity enhances the complexity of the
self-gravitating structure.

high-level abstractions from low-level sensory data. An essential component of
such inference is the ability to discover modularized generative mechanisms.
Despite many efforts to use statistical learning and pattern recognition for
finding disentangled factors, arguably human intelligence remains unmatched in
this area.
  In this paper, we investigate a problem of learning, in a fully unsupervised
manner, the inverse of a set of independent mechanisms from distorted data
points. We postulate, and justify this claim with experimental results, that an
important weakness of existing machine learning solutions lies in the
insufficiency of cross-module diversification. Addressing this crucial
discrepancy between human and machine intelligence is an important challenge
for pattern recognition systems.
  To this end, our work proposes an unsupervised method that discovers and
disentangles a set of independent mechanisms from unlabeled data, and learns
how to invert them. A number of experts compete against each other for
individual data points in an adversarial setting: one that best inverses the
(unknown) generative mechanism is the winner. We demonstrate that introducing
an orthogonalization layer into the expert architectures enforces additional
diversity in the outputs, leading to significantly better separability.
Moreover, we propose a procedure for relocating data points between experts to
further prevent any one from claiming multiple mechanisms. We experimentally
illustrate that these techniques allow discovery and modularization of much
less pronounced transformations, in addition to considerably faster
convergence.

  This analysis, which examines the text and history of Section 230 in light of
two strains of pre-Internet vicarious liability defamation doctrine, concludes
that the immunity provision of Section 230, though broad, was not intended to
abrogate entirely traditional common law notions of vicarious liability. Some
bases of vicarious liability remain, and their continuing validity both
explains the textual puzzles courts have faced in applying Section 230 and

Court has yet to articulate how that case's doctrine of deference to agency
statutory interpretations relates to one of the most compelling federalism
issues of our time: regulatory preemption of state law. Should courts defer to
preemptive agency interpretations under Chevron, or do preemption's federalism
implications demand a less deferential approach? Commentators have provided no
shortage of possible solutions, but thus far the Court has resisted all of
them.
  This Article makes two contributions to the debate. First, through a detailed
analysis of the Court's recent agency-preemption decisions, I trace its
hesitancy to adopt any of the various proposed rules to its high regard for
congressional intent where areas of traditional state sovereignty are at risk.
Recognizing that congressional intent to delegate preemptive authority varies
from case to case, the Court has hesitated to adopt an across-the-board rule.
Any such rule would constrain the Court and risk mismatch with congressional
intent -- a risk it accepts under Chevron generally but which it finds
particularly troublesome in the delicate area of federal preemption.
  Second, building on this previously underappreciated factor in the Court's
analysis, I suggest a novel solution of variable deference that avoids the
inflexibility inherent in an across-the-board rule while providing greater
predictability than the Court's current haphazard approach. The proposed rule
would grant full Chevron-style deference in those cases where congressional
delegative intent is most likely -- where Congress has expressly preempted some
state law and the agency interpretation merely resolves preemptive scope --
while withholding deference in those cases where Congress has remained
completely silent as to preemption and delegative intent is least likely.

techniques. Such model-based methods utilize mathematical formulations that
represent the underlying physics, prior information and additional domain
knowledge. Simple classical models are useful but sensitive to inaccuracies and
may lead to poor performance when real systems display complex or dynamic
behavior. More recently, deep learning approaches that use deep neural networks
are becoming increasingly popular. Deep learning systems do not rely on
mathematical modeling, and learn their mapping from data, which allows them to
operate in complex environments. However, they lack the interpretability and
reliability of model-based methods, typically require large training sets to
obtain good performance, and tend to be computationally complex. Model-based
signal processing methods and data-centric deep learning each have their pros
and cons. These paradigms can be characterized as edges of a continuous
spectrum varying in specificity and parameterization. The methodologies that
lie in the middle ground of this spectrum, thus integrating model-based signal
processing with deep learning, are referred to as model-based deep learning,
and are the focus here. This monograph provides a tutorial style presentation
of model-based deep learning methodologies. These are families of algorithms
that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems to benefit
from the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep learning methods
exploit both partial domain knowledge, via mathematical structures designed for
specific problems, as well as learning from limited data. We accompany our
presentation with running examples, in super-resolution, dynamic systems, and
array processing. We show how they are expressed using the provided
characterization and specialized in each of the detailed methodologies.

this paper, we propose the notion of Sustainable Adaptive Security (SAS) which
reflects such enduring protection by augmenting adaptive security systems with
the capability of mitigating newly discovered threats. To achieve this
objective, a SAS system should be designed by combining automation (e.g., to
discover and mitigate security threats) and human intervention (e.g., to
resolve uncertainties during threat discovery and mitigation). In this paper,
we use a smart home example to showcase how we can engineer the activities of
the MAPE (Monitor, Analysis, Planning, and Execution) loop of systems
satisfying sustainable adaptive security. We suggest that using anomaly
detection together with abductive reasoning can help discover new threats and
guide the evolution of security requirements and controls. We also exemplify
situations when humans can be involved in the execution of the activities of
the MAPE loop and discuss the requirements to engineer human interventions.

Pol'y 1177 (2010)",,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In Wyeth v. Levine the Supreme Court once again failed to reconcile the
interpretive presumption against preemption with the sometimes competing
Chevron doctrine of deference to agencies' reasonable statutory
interpretations. Rather than resolve the issue of which principle should govern
where the two principles point toward opposite results, the Court continued its
recent practice of applying both principles halfheartedly, carving exceptions,
and giving neither its proper weight.
  This analysis situates Wyeth within the larger framework of the Court's
recent preemption decisions in an effort to explain the Court's hesitancy to
resolve the conflict. The analysis concludes that the Court, motivated by its
strong respect for congressional intent and concern to protect federalism,
applies both the presumption against preemption and the Chevron doctrine on a
sliding scale. Where congressional intent to preempt is clear and vague only as
to scope, the Court is usually quite deferential to agency determinations, but
where congressional preemptive intent is unclear, agency views are accorded
less weight.
  The Court's variable approach to deference is defensible as necessary to
prevent unauthorized incursion into areas of traditional state sovereignty, but
its inherent unpredictability sows confusion among regulated parties, and the
need for flexibility prevents the Court from adopting any of the more
predictable across-the-board approaches to deference proposed by the Court's
critics. A superior approach would combine the Court's concern for federalism
with the certainty of a bright-line rule by granting deference to agency views
where Congress has spoken via a preemption clause of ambiguous scope and no
deference where Congress has remained silent.

oral argument receives an out-sized share of attention in the popular media.
Despite its prominence, however, the basic function and operation of oral
argument as an institution remains poorly understood, as political scientists
and legal scholars continue to debate even the most fundamental questions about
its role.
  Past study of oral argument has tended to focus on discrete, quantifiable
attributes of oral argument, such as the number of questions asked to each
advocate, the party of the Justices' appointing president, or the ideological
implications of the case on appeal. Such studies allow broad generalizations
about oral argument and judicial decision making: Justices tend to vote in
accordance with their ideological preferences, and they tend to ask more
questions when they are skeptical of a party's position. But they tell us
little about the actual goings on at oral argument -- the running dialog
between Justice and advocate that is the heart of the institution.
  This Article fills that void, using machine learning techniques to, for the
first time, construct predictive models of judicial decision making based not
on oral argument's superficial features or on factors external to oral
argument, such as where the case falls on a liberal-conservative spectrum, but
on the actual content of the oral argument itself -- the Justices' questions to
each side. The resultant models offer an important new window into aspects of
oral argument that have long resisted empirical study, including the Justices'
individual questioning styles, how each expresses skepticism, and which of the
Justices' questions are most central to oral argument dialog.

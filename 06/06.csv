balance intermittent generation from wind and solar energy, for example,
through frequency regulation. Here, we derive an analytical solution to the
decision-making problem of storage operators who sell frequency regulation
power to grid operators and trade electricity on day-ahead markets.
Mathematically, we treat future frequency deviation trajectories as functional
uncertainties in a receding horizon robust optimization problem. We constrain
the expected terminal state-of-charge to be equal to some target to allow
storage operators to make good decisions not only for the present but also the
future. Thanks to this constraint, the amount of electricity traded on
day-ahead markets is an implicit function of the regulation power sold to grid
operators. The implicit function quantifies the amount of power that needs to
be purchased to cover the expected energy loss that results from providing
frequency regulation. We show how the marginal cost associated with the
expected energy loss decreases with roundtrip efficiency and increases with
frequency deviation dispersion. We find that the profits from frequency
regulation over the lifetime of energy-constrained storage devices are roughly
inversely proportional to the length of time for which regulation power must be
committed.

Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted edge devices are particularly advantageous for
FEEL due to their flexibility and mobility in efficient data collection. In
UAV-assisted FEEL, sensing, computation, and communication are coupled and
compete for limited onboard resources, and UAV deployment also affects sensing
and communication performance. Therefore, the joint design of UAV deployment
and resource allocation is crucial to achieving the optimal training
performance. In this paper, we address the problem of joint UAV deployment
design and resource allocation for FEEL via a concrete case study of human
motion recognition based on wireless sensing. We first analyze the impact of
UAV deployment on the sensing quality and identify a threshold value for the
sensing elevation angle that guarantees a satisfactory quality of data samples.
Due to the non-ideal sensing channels, we consider the probabilistic sensing
model, where the successful sensing probability of each UAV is determined by
its position. Then, we derive the upper bound of the FEEL training loss as a
function of the sensing probability. Theoretical results suggest that the
convergence rate can be improved if UAVs have a uniform successful sensing
probability. Based on this analysis, we formulate a training time minimization
problem by jointly optimizing UAV deployment, integrated sensing, computation,
and communication (ISCC) resources under a desirable optimality gap constraint.
To solve this challenging mixed-integer non-convex problem, we apply the
alternating optimization technique, and propose the bandwidth, batch size, and
position optimization (BBPO) scheme to optimize these three decision variables
alternately.

molecules confined in optical tweezers or optical lattices may be used to
encode interacting qubits for quantum computation or pseudo-spins for
simulating quantum magnetism. As with all quantum platforms, the engineering of
robust coherent superpositions of states is vital. However, for optically
trapped molecules, the coherence time between rotational states is typically
limited by inhomogeneous light shifts. Here we demonstrate a rotationally-magic
optical trap for RbCs molecules that supports a Ramsey coherence time of
0.78(4) seconds in the absence of dipole-dipole interactions. This extends to
>1.4 seconds at the 95% confidence level using a single spin-echo pulse. In our
magic trap, dipolar interactions become the dominant mechanism by which Ramsey
contrast is lost for superpositions that generate oscillating dipoles. By
changing the states forming the superposition, we tune the effective dipole

strength of the dipolar interaction. Our work unlocks the full potential of the
rotational degree of freedom in molecules for quantum computation and quantum

solid lubrication performance with different normal loads (100 and 200 mN) and
sliding frequencies (1 and 2.4 Hz) using linear-reciprocating ball-on-disk
tribometry. We demonstrate that MXenes' tribological performance depends on
their initial state (delaminated few-layer vs. multi-layer particles), coating
thickness and sliding velocity. Specifically, the best behavior is observed for
thinner multi-layer coatings tested at the lower frequency. In contrast,
coatings made of delaminated few-layer MXene are not as effective as their
multi-layer counterparts. Our high-resolution interface characterization by

small angles and a distant observer. To establish the formal conditions for
this limit, we first resort to a simplified shape of the 3D power spectrum,
which allows us to obtain analytic results for both the full- and flat-sky
angular power spectra. Using a saddle-point approximation, we find that the
flat-sky results are obtained in the limit when the comoving distance and wave
modes $\ell$ approach infinity at the same rate. This allows us to obtain an
analogous asymptotic expansion of the full-sky angular power spectrum for
general 3D power spectrum shapes, including the LCDM Universe. In this way, we
find a robust limit of correspondence between the full- and flat-sky results.
These results also establish a mathematical relation, i.e., an asymptotic
expansion of the ordinary hypergeometric function of a particular choice of
arguments that physically corresponds to the flat-sky approximation of a

is obtained in two ways: relying on our saddle-point approximation and using
some of the known properties of the hypergeometric function.

challenge for the EMI model is the generation of high-quality meshes conforming
to the complex geometries of brain cells. To overcome this challenge we propose
a novel cut finite element method (CutFEM) where the membrane geometry can be
represented independently of a structured and easy-to-generated background mesh
for the remaining computational domain.
  Starting from a Godunov splitting scheme, the EMI model is split into
separate PDE and ODE parts. The resulting PDE part is a non-standard elliptic
interface problem, for which we devise two different CutFEM formulations: one
single-dimensional formulation with the intra/extracellular electrical
potentials as unknowns, and a multi-dimensional formulation which also
introduces the electrical current over the membrane as an additional unknown
leading to a generalized saddle point problem with a penalty-like term. Both
formulations are augmentied by suitably designed ghost penalties to ensure that
the stability and convergence properties of the resulting discretizations are
insensitive to how the membrane surface mesh cuts the background mesh.For the
ODE part, we introduce a new unfitted discretization which is based on a
stabilized mass matrix approach and allows us to solve the membrane bound ODEs
even if the membrane interface is not aligned with the background mesh.
Finally, we perform extensive numerical to demonstrate that CutFEM is a
promising approach to efficiently simulate electrical activity in geometrically

photochemistry. We find that stratospheric dayside-to-nightside overturning
circulation can advect ozone-rich air to the nightside. On the nightside,
ozone-rich air subsides at the locations of two quasi-stationary Rossby gyres,
resulting in an exchange between the stratosphere and troposphere and the
accumulation of ozone at the gyre locations. We identify the hemispheric

dimension-seven (dim-7) operators, which are suitable for the matching of
ultraviolet models onto the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) and
the deviation of renormalization group equations (RGEs) for dim-7 operators in
the SMEFT. The reduction relations to convert operators in the Green's basis to
those in the physical basis are achieved as well, where some redundant dim-6
operators in the Green's basis are involved if the dim-5 operator exists.
Working in these two bases for dim-7 operators and with the help of the
reduction relations, we work out the one-loop RGEs resulting from the mixing
among different dimensional operators for the dim-5 and dim-7 operators up to
$\mathcal{O} \left( \Lambda^{-3} \right)$ in the SMEFT. These new results
complete the previous results for RGEs of the dim-5 and dim-7 operators and
hence can be used for a consistent one-loop analysis of the SMEFT at
$\mathcal{O} \left( \Lambda^{-3} \right)$.

electricity demand is critical for maintaining the reliability of electricity
generation and distribution. Load forecasting studies typically exclude
households with home EV charging, focusing on offices, schools, and public

Long Short-Term Memory Bayesian Neural Networks (LSTM-BNNs) for household load
forecasting in presence of EV charging. The approach takes advantage of the
LSTM model to capture the time dependencies and uses the dropout layer with
Bayesian inference to generate prediction intervals. Results show that the

advantage of prediction intervals. Moreover, the impact of lockdowns related to

exposure-response and confounding scenarios via simulation. Additionally, we
apply these methods to estimate the ERC between long-term $PM_{2.5}$ exposure

in the United States. Our simulation indicates that regression methods not
placed within a causal inference framework are unsuitable when anticipating
heterogeneous exposure effects. Under the setting of a large sample size and

relationship between annual average $PM_{2.5}$ and all-cause mortality in the

by predictive (discriminative) approaches, such as spectral mapping or masking.
Recently, however, novel generative approaches have been applied to speech
enhancement, attaining good denoising performance with high subjective quality
scores. At the same time, advances in deep learning also allowed for the
creation of neural network-based metrics, which have desirable traits such as
being able to work without a reference (non-intrusively). Since generatively
enhanced speech tends to exhibit radically different residual distortions, its
evaluation using instrumental speech metrics may behave differently compared to
predictively enhanced speech. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of the
same speech enhancement backbone trained under predictive and generative
paradigms on a variety of metrics and show that intrusive and non-intrusive
measures correlate differently for each paradigm. This analysis motivates the
search for metrics that can together paint a complete and unbiased picture of

shows that the SOP of all of the NOMA users is compromised, and that our

absorption-based contrast in soft tissue at depths of several centimeters. When

This effect is directly proportional to bone thickness. As a result,
transcranial PA imaging in humans has been challenging to demonstrate. We
measured the acoustic constraints imposed by the human skull to design an
ultrasound sensor suitable for transcranial PA imaging and sensing. We imaged
the phantoms using a planar Fabry-Perot sensor and employed a range of
piezoelectric and optical ultrasound sensors to measure the frequency dependent
acoustic transmission through human cranial bone. Transcranial PA images show
typical frequency and thickness dependent attenuation and aberration effects
associated with acoustic propagation through bone. The skull insertion loss
measurements showed significant transmission at low frequencies. In comparison
to conventional piezoelectric sensors, the performance of plano-concave optical
resonator (PCOR) ultrasound sensors was found to be highly suitable for
transcranial PA measurements. They possess high acoustic sensitivity at a low
acoustic frequency range that coincides with the transmission window of human
skull bone. PCOR sensors showed low noise equivalent pressures and flat
frequency response which enabled them to outperform conventional piezoelectric
transducers in transcranial PA sensing experiments. Transcranial PA sensing and
imaging requires ultrasound sensors with high sensitivity at low acoustic

Interestingly, many real-world systems modeled as hypergraphs contain
edge-dependent node labels, i.e., node labels that vary depending on
hyperedges. For example, on co-authorship datasets, the same author (i.e., a

corresponding author in another paper (i.e., another hyperedge).
  In this work, we introduce a classification of edge-dependent node labels as

aspects: (1) They rely mostly on a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model
whilst missing the necessary 3D awareness and head priors. This makes them
prone to inconsistency and geometric distortions in the generated avatars. (2)
They fall short in fine-grained editing. This is primarily due to the inherited
limitations from the pre-trained 2D image diffusion models, which become more
pronounced when it comes to 3D head avatars. In this work, we address these
challenges by introducing a versatile coarse-to-fine pipeline dubbed HeadSculpt

leveraging landmark-based control and a learned textual embedding representing
the back view appearance of heads, enabling 3D-consistent head avatar

represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game
structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system
specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing
incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on
some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL
properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the
complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality

that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy.
Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis

cooperation between the UAV and the surrounding transponder-equipped aviation
obstacles. To do so, the aviation obstacles share their altitude and their
identification code with the UAV by using a miniaturized Mode S operation
Secondary surveillance radar (SSR) after interrogation. The proposed SAA
algorithm removes the need for a primary radar and a clock synchronization
since it relies on the estimate of the aviation obstacle's elevation angle for
ranging. This results in more accurate ranging compared to the round-trip
time-based ranging. We also propose a new radial velocity estimator for the
Mode S operation of the SSR which is employed in the proposed SAA system. The
root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed estimators are analytically
derived. Moreover, by considering the pulse-position modulation (PPM) of the
transponder reply as a waveform of pulse radar with staggered multiple pulse
repetition frequencies, the maximum unambiguous radial velocity is obtained.
Given these estimated parameters, our proposed SAA method classifies the
aviation obstacles into high-, medium-, and low-risk intruders. The output of
the classifier enables the UAV to plan its path or maneuver for safe navigation
accordingly. The effectiveness of the proposed estimators and the SAA method is

flood depth for determining flood risk and extent of damage to properties. We
used image segmentation for detecting door bottoms and roadside edges from
Google Street View images. The characteristic of equirectangular projection
with constant spacing representation of horizontal and vertical angles allows
extraction of the pitch angle from the camera to the door bottom. The depth
from the camera to the door bottom was obtained from the depthmap paired with
the Google Street View image. LFEs were calculated from the pitch angle and the
depth. The testbed for application of the proposed method is Meyerland (Harris
County, Texas). The results show that the proposed method achieved mean
absolute error of 0.190 m (1.18 %) in estimating LFE. The height difference
between the street and the lowest floor (HDSL) was estimated to provide
information for flood damage estimation. The proposed automatic LFE estimation
algorithm using Street View images and image segmentation provides a rapid and
cost-effective method for LFE estimation compared with the surveys using total

this issue the relativistic feedback mechanism was suggested by Joseph Dwyer.
The Monte Carlo simulations and analytical descriptions of this type of
feedback assume that acceleration region has a large size in a plane
perpendicular to the direction of the electric field. Therefore these studies
do not take into account transverse diffusion of RREAs starting points and the
finite transverse size of the accelerating region. Electrons created by the
feedback outside this region can not be accelerated by the electric field and
form an avalanche, which may lead to a decrease in the total number of new
avalanches and an increase in the requirements for self-sustaining RREA
production by the feedback. In this article the transverse propagation of
avalanches starting points was described using a modified two-dimensional
diffusion equation. A correction to the criterion for self-sustaining
production of RREAs was obtained. Monte Carlo simulation was also performed to

functions in which the loss function of each data point is defined in a way
that contrasts the data point with a large number of others. They have broad
applications in AI for solving classical and emerging problems, including but
not limited to classification for imbalanced data (CID), learning to rank

developing LibAUC is to address the convergence issues of existing libraries
for solving these problems. In particular, existing libraries may not converge
or require very large mini-batch sizes in order to attain good performance for
these problems, due to the usage of the standard mini-batch technique in the
empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our library is for deep X-risk

tasks for CID, LTR and CLR. The contributions of this paper include: (1) It
introduces a new mini-batch based pipeline for implementing DXO algorithms,
which differs from existing DL pipeline in the design of controlled data
samplers and dynamic mini-batch losses; (2) It provides extensive benchmarking
experiments for ablation studies and comparison with existing libraries. The
LibAUC library features scalable performance for millions of items to be

learning a policy that $\textit{explores}$ the domain effectively is harder to
memorize than a policy that maximizes reward for a specific task, and therefore
we expect such learned behavior to generalize well; we indeed demonstrate this
empirically on several domains that are difficult for invariance-based
approaches. Our $\textit{Explore to Generalize}$ algorithm (ExpGen) builds on
this insight: We train an additional ensemble of agents that optimize reward.
At test time, either the ensemble agrees on an action, and we generalize well,
or we take exploratory actions, which are guaranteed to generalize and drive us
to a novel part of the state space, where the ensemble may potentially agree
again. We show that our approach is the state-of-the-art on several tasks in
the ProcGen challenge that have so far eluded effective generalization. For
example, we demonstrate a success rate of $82\%$ on the Maze task and $74\%$ on
Heist with $200$ training levels.

  Compression","Extended preprint",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to
high-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via
quantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited
devices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However,
quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high
accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range,
which are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we
introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format
and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless
compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression
levels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier
weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them
in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and
achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for
highly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B
parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance
degradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer
without any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding
weights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime.
Specifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which
yields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while
enabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.

temperatures and oxygen abundances using the direct T$_e$ method. We directly
compare against a suite of locally calibrated strong-line diagnostics and
recent high-$z$ calibrations. We find the calibrations fail to simultaneously
match our JADES sample, thus warranting a self-consistent revision of these
calibrations for the high-$z$ Universe. We find weak dependence between R2 and
O3O2 with metallicity, thus suggesting these line-ratios are ineffective in the
high-$z$ Universe as metallicity diagnostics and degeneracy breakers. We find
R3 and R23 still correlate with metallicity, but we find tentative flattening
of these diagnostics, thus suggesting future difficulties when applying these
strong-line ratios as metallicity indicators in the high-$z$ Universe. We also
propose and test an alternative diagnostic based on a different combination of
R3 and R2 with a higher dynamic range. We find a reasonably good agreement
(median offset of 0.002 dex, median absolute offset of 0.13 dex) with the JWST
sample at low metallicity. Our sample demonstrates higher ionization/excitation
ratios than local galaxies with rest-frame EWs(H$\beta$) $\approx 200 -300$
Angstroms. However, we find the median rest-frame EWs(H$\beta$) of our sample
to be $\sim 2\text{x}$ less than the galaxies used for the local calibrations.
This EW discrepancy combined with the high ionization of our galaxies does not

surrogate single-impurity generalized Kondo model and employ the poor man's
scaling approach. The scale-dependent $J_K$ and $J$ are derived analytically
within the one-loop poor man's scaling approach, and the Kondo temperature
($T_K$) and the characteristic Hund's rule coupling ($J^*$, defined by the
renormalized value of $J$ at some small finite energy scale) are estimated over
a wide range of filling factors. We find that $T_K$ depends strongly on the
filling factors as well as the value of $J_K$. Slightly doping away from
integer fillings and/or increasing $J_K$ may substantially enhance $T_K$ in the
parameter regime relevant to experiments. $J^*$ is always reduced from the bare
value of $J$, but the filling factor dependence is not as significant as it is
for $T_K$. Our results suggest that it is essential to incorporate the
renormalization of $J_K$ and $J$ in the many-body calculations, and Kondo
screening should occur for a wide range of fractional fillings in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene, implying the existence of Kondo-driven correlated
metallic phases. We also point out that the observation of distinct phases at
integer fillings in different samples may be due to the variation of $J_K$ in
addition to disorder and strain in the experiments.

recently discovered hydride superconductor, CeH$_9$. By performing simultaneous
magnetometry and electrical transport measurements, we observe the dual
signatures of superconductivity: local diamagnetism characteristic of the
Meissner effect and a sharp drop of the resistance to near zero. By locally
mapping the Meissner effect and flux trapping, we directly image the geometry

baryons. Both these transition rates are governed by the effective Yukawa
coupling for the dissociation of $S$ into two baryons with the same quantum

observational constraints on $\tilde{g}$, improving on various previous limits.
The stability of deuterium severely disfavors $m_S<1800$ MeV, while if
$m_S>2050$ MeV its lifetime is too short to be the dark matter. Laboratory
experimental searches for the H-dibaryon, which has the same quark content as

to filaments is important, as it is related to the process of matter accretion
onto the former. For this reason, investigating the connections to the cosmic
web of massive clusters, especially well known ones for which a lot of
information is available, is a hot topic in astrophysics. In a previous work we
performed an analysis of the filament connections of the Coma cluster of
galaxies, as detected from the observed galaxy distribution. In this work we
resort to a numerical simulation whose initial conditions are constrained to
reproduce the Local Universe, including the region of the Coma cluster to
interpret our observations in an evolutionary context. We detect the filaments
connected to the simulated Coma cluster and perform an accurate comparison with
the cosmic web configuration we detected in observations. We perform an
analysis of the halos' spatial and velocity distributions close to the
filaments in the cluster outskirts. We conclude that, although not
significantly larger than the average, the flux of accreting matter on the
simulated Coma cluster is significantly more collimated close to the filaments
with respect to the general isotropic accretion flux. This paper is the first
example of such a result and the first installment in a series of publications

rejuvenated thick disc objects, most probably evolved blue stragglers. This is
confirmed by their position in the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Extending
our selection to dwarfs allows us to obtain the first general straggler

enhancement in cerium may be the signature of a mass transfer from an

galaxy samples with accurate redshifts. The current theoretical modeling of
this estimator involves an approximate treatment only applicable at small
scales. As the measurement fidelity rapidly improves, we find it necessary to
move beyond the original treatment and hence derive an improved theoretical
model for this estimator without these previous approximations. We show that
the differences between the predicted signal from the two models are
scale-dependent and will be significant for future measurements from the Simons
Observatory and CMB-S4 in combination with galaxy data from WISE or the Rubin
Observatory, which have high forecasted signal-to-noise ratios ($>100$). Thus,
adopting our improved model in future analyses will be important to avoid
biases. Equipped with our model, we explore the cosmological dependence of this
kSZ signal for future measurements. With a Planck prior, residual uncertainty
on $\Lambda$CDM parameters leads to $\sim7\%$ marginalized uncertainties on the
signal amplitude, compared to a sub-percent level forecasted with a fixed
cosmology. To illustrate the potential of this kSZ estimator as a cosmological
probe, we forecast initial constraints on $\Lambda$CDM parameters and the sum
of neutrino masses, paving the way for jointly fitting both baryonic

non-active supermassive black holes. For that purpose, we use 551 X-ray
detected active galactic nuclei (AGN) and 16,917 non-AGN galaxies in the
COSMOS-Legacy survey, for which the surface-density field measurements are
available. The sources lie at redshift of $\rm 0.3<z<1.2$, probe X-ray
luminosities of $\rm 42<log\,[L_{X,2-10keV}(erg\,s^{-1})]<44$ and have stellar
masses, $\rm 10.5<log\,[M_*(M_\odot)]<11.5$. Our results show that isolated AGN
(field) have lower SFR compared to non AGN, at all L$_X$ spanned by our sample.
However, in denser environments (filaments, clusters), moderate L$_X$ AGN ($\rm
log\,[L_{X,2-10keV}(erg\,s^{-1})]>43$) and non-AGN galaxies have similar SFR.
We, also, examine the stellar populations and the morphology of the sources in
different cosmic fields. For the same morphological type, non-AGN galaxies tend
to have older stellar populations and are less likely to have undergone a
recent burst in denser environments compared to their field counterparts. The
differences in the stellar populations with the density field are, mainly,
driven by quiescent systems. Moreover, low L$_X$ AGN present negligible
variations of their stellar populations, in all cosmic environments, whereas
moderate L$_X$ AGN have, on average, younger stellar populations and are more
likely to have undergone a recent burst, in high density fields. Finally, in
the case of non-AGN galaxies, the fraction of bulge-dominated (BD) systems
increases with the density field, while BD AGN are scarce in denser
environments. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which a common
mechanism, such as mergers, triggers both the SF and the AGN activity.

systems are mainly formed via close stellar encounters. We also find an
unexpected rise in the number of X-ray sources for GCs with low rates of
stellar encounters, suggesting that there is a dynamical threshold where the
formation of X-ray sources is dominated by stellar encounters. Furthermore, we
use the Heggie-Hills law to find that subsequent stellar encounters in these

the rare strong gravitational lenses from large imaging data sets, their
selection remains significantly affected by the large number and diversity of
nonlens contaminants. This work evaluates and compares systematically the
performance of neural networks in order to move towards a rapid selection of
galaxy-scale strong lenses with minimal human input in the era of deep,
wide-scale surveys. We used multiband images from PDR2 of the HSC Wide survey
to build test sets mimicking an actual classification experiment, with 189
strong lenses previously found over the HSC footprint and 70,910 nonlens
galaxies in COSMOS. Multiple networks were trained on different sets of
realistic strong-lens simulations and nonlens galaxies, with various
architectures and data pre-processing. The overall performances strongly depend
on the construction of the ground-truth training data and they typically, but
not systematically, improve using our baseline residual network architecture.
Improvements are found when applying random shifts to the image centroids and
square root stretches to the pixel values, adding z band, or using random
viewpoints of the original images, but not when adding difference images to
subtract emission from the central galaxy. The most significant gain is
obtained with committees of networks trained on different data sets, and
showing a moderate overlap between populations of false positives.
Nearly-perfect invariance to image quality can be achieved by training networks
either with large number of bands, or jointly with the PSF and science frames.
Overall, we show the possibility to reach a TPR0 as high as 60% for the test
sets under consideration, which opens promising perspectives for pure selection
of strong lenses without human input using the Rubin Observatory and other
forthcoming ground-based surveys.

with corresponding $k$-ranges of $0.02<k<0.15$ and $0.02<k<0.12$ each, the
diagonal covariance approximation recovers $\sim 10\%$ larger error-bars on the

underestimating the true errors by a factor of $\sim 10\%$. This is caused by
the diagonal approximation weighting the elements of the data-vector in a
sub-optimal way, resulting in a less efficient estimator than the maximum
likelihood estimator featuring the full covariance matrix. We further
investigate intermediate approximations to the full covariance matrix, with up
to $\sim 80\%$ of zero elements, which could be advantageous for theoretical
and hybrid approaches. We expect these results to be qualitatively insensitive
to variations of the total cosmological volume, predominantly depending on the
bin size and shot-noise, thus making them particularly significant for present

white dwarf interiors. The most ideal benchmarks for understanding this
discrepancy would be bright and nearby crystallizing white dwarfs with total
ages that can be externally constrained. In this work we report that a recently
discovered white dwarf is a bound companion to the triple star HD 190412,
forming a new Sirius-like system in the solar neighbourhood. The location of HD
190412 C on the $T_{\text{eff}}-\text{mass}$ diagram implies it is undergoing

whose total age can be externally constrained. Motivated by the possibility
that a cooling delay caused by crystallization can be directly detected for
this white dwarf we employ a variety of methods to constrain the age of the
system; however, our empirical age anomaly of $+3.1\pm1.9$ Gyr is ultimately
too imprecise to reach statistical significance, preventing us from making
strong constraints to models of white dwarf crystallization. Our results are
nonetheless compatible with the recent hypothesis that $^{22}$Ne phase

fundamental challenge in contemporary astrophysics. Recent advances in the

crucially important for our understanding of cosmological galaxy formation and
evolution. The appealing features of CRs are their relatively long cooling
times and relatively strong dynamical coupling to the gas. In galaxies, CRs can
be close to equipartition with the thermal, magnetic, and turbulent energy
density in the interstellar medium, and can be dynamically very important in
driving large-scale galactic winds. Similarly, CRs may provide a significant
contribution to the pressure in the circumgalactic medium. In galaxy clusters,
CRs may play a key role in addressing the classic cooling flow problem by
facilitating efficient heating of the intracluster medium and preventing
excessive star formation. Overall, the underlying physics of CR interactions
with plasmas exhibit broad parallels across the entire range of scales
characteristic of the interstellar, circumgalactic, and intracluster media.

bond-dependent frustrated interactions presents an ideal system to test QuCl.
The model hosts a wealth of quantum spin liquid states: gapped and gapless
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquids, and a chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase in a small
external magnetic field. Recently, various simulations have found a new
intermediate gapless phase (IGP), sandwiched between the CSL and a partially
polarized phase, launching a debate over its elusive nature. We reveal
signatures of phases in the model by contrasting two phases pairwise using an
interpretable neural network, the correlator convolutional neural network
(CCNN). We train the CCNN with a labeled collection of sampled projective
measurements and reveal signatures of each phase through regularization path
analysis. We show that QuCl reproduces known features of established spin
liquid phases and ordered phases. Most significantly, we identify a signature
motif of the field-induced IGP in the spin channel perpendicular to the field

(CGM) of galaxies has been confirmed both in observations and high-resolution
simulations, but its origin still represents a puzzle. Possible mechanisms are
cold accretion from the intergalactic medium (IGM), clumps embedded in outflows
and transported from the disk, gas detaching from the hot CGM phase via thermal
instabilities. In this work, we aim at characterizing the history of cold CGM
gas, in order to identify the dominant origin channels at different
evolutionary stages of the main galaxy. To this goal, we track gas particles in
different snapshots of the SPH cosmological zoom-in simulation Eris2k. We
perform a backward tracking of cold gas, starting from different redshifts,
until we identify one of the followings origins for the particle: cold inflow,
ejected from the disk, cooling down in-situ or stripped from a satellite. We
also perform a forward tracking of gas in different components of the galaxy
(such as the disk and outflows). We find a clear transition between two epochs.
For $z>2$, most cold gas (up to 80%) in the CGM comes from cold accretion
streams as the galaxy is accreting in the ""cold mode"" from the IGM. At lower
$z$, gas either cools down in-situ after several recycles (with 10-20% of the
gas cooling in outflow), or it is ejected directly from the disk (up to 30%).
Outflows have a major contribution to the cold CGM gas budget at $z<1$, with
almost 50% of hot gas cooling in outflow. Finally, we discuss possible
mechanisms for CGM cooling, showing that the thermally unstable gas with
$t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}<1$ (precipitation-regulated feedback) is abundant up
to $r\sim 100$ kpc and cooling times are shorter than 50 Myr for densities

predicts a global 21cm signal which reaches a minimum brightness temperature of

the impact of dust on galaxy properties (such as the star formation rate

impact on the global 21cm signal; (iii) the ``maximal"" model predicts $T_{\rm

21cm parameters have a degenerate impact on the global 21cm signal. A
combination of the minimum temperature and its redshift will therefore be
crucial in constraining galaxy formation parameters and their coupling to the

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are large organic molecules that trace
millimeter-size dust grains and regulate the cooling of the interstellar gas

been difficult due to the limited sensitivity and wavelength coverage of
previous infrared telescopes. Here we present JWST observations that detect the

formation, rather than black hole accretion, dominates the infrared emission

stars and hot dust are spatially distinct from one another, leading to
order-of-magnitude variations in the PAH equivalent width and the ratio of PAH
to total infrared luminosity across the galaxy. The spatial variations we
observe suggest either a physical offset between the PAHs and large dust grains
or wide variations in the local ultraviolet radiation field. Our observations
demonstrate that differences in the emission from PAH molecules and large dust
grains are a complex result of localized processes within early galaxies.

role in driving the intense star-formation rates hosted in these galaxies. We
aim to estimate the molecular gas content of high-z DSFGs by using various gas
mass tracers such as the [CI], CO, [CII] emission lines and the dust content.
These tracers need to be well calibrated as they are all limited by
uncertainties on factors such as aCO, XCI, aCII and GDR, thereby affecting the
determination of the gas mass accurately. The main goal of our work is to check
the consistency between the gas mass tracers and cross-calibrate the uncertain
factors. We observe the two [CI] line transitions for 29 SPT-SMGs with the
ALMA-ACA. Additionally, we also present new APEX observations of [CII] line for
9 of these galaxies. We find a nearly linear relation between the infrared
luminosity and [CI] luminosity if we fit the starbursts and main-sequence
galaxies separately. We measure a median [CI]-derived excitation temperature of
34.5+/-2.1 K. We probe the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as
density and radiation field intensity using [CI] to mid- or high-J CO lines and
[CI] to infrared luminosity ratio, and find similar values to the SMG
populations in literature. Finally, the gas masses estimated from [CI], CO,
dust, and [CII] do not exhibit any significant trend with the infrared
luminosity or the dust temperature. We provide the various cross-calibrations
between these tracers. Our study confirms that [CI] is a suitable tracer of the
molecular gas content, and shows an overall agreement between all the classical
gas tracers used at high redshift. However, their absolute calibration and thus
the gas depletion timescale measurements remain uncertain.

different Astraeus and 21cmFAST reionisation simulations covering a physically
plausible range of scenarios where either low-mass ($<10^{9.5}M_\odot$) or
massive ($>10^{9.5}M_\odot$) galaxies drive reionisation. Our key findings are:
(i) the negative small-scale ($<2$ cMpc) cross-correlation amplitude scales
with the intergalactic medium's (IGM) average HI fraction
($\langle\chi_\mathrm{HI}\rangle$) and spin-temperature weighted overdensity in
neutral regions ($\langle1+\delta\rangle_\mathrm{HI}$); (ii) the inversion
point of the cross-correlation function traces the peak of the size
distribution of ionised regions around LAEs; (iii) the cross-correlation
amplitude at small scales is sensitive to the reionisation topology, with its
anti-correlation or correlation decreasing the stronger the ionising emissivity
of the underlying galaxy population is correlated to the cosmic web gas
distribution (i.e. the more low-mass galaxies drive reionisation); (iv) the
required simulation volume to not underpredict the 21cm-LAE anti-correlation
amplitude when the cross-correlation is derived via the cross-power spectrum
rises as the size of ionised regions and their variance increases. Our analytic
expression can serve two purposes: to test whether simulation volumes are

three different statistical quantities of one-dimensional Brownian motion: the
time at which the process reaches its maximum position, the total time the
process spends in the positive half-space and the time at which the process
crosses the origin for the last time. Remarkably the cumulative probabilities
of these three observables all follows the same distribution, the Arcsine
distribution. But in real systems, space is often heterogeneous, and these laws
are likely to hold no longer. In this paper we explore such a scenario and
study how the presence of a spatial heterogeneity alters these Arcsine laws.
Specifically we consider the case of a thin permeable barrier, which is often
employed to represent diffusion impeding heterogeneities in physical and
biological systems such as multilayer electrodes, electrical gap junctions,
cell membranes and fragmentation in the landscape for dispersing animals. Using
the Feynman-Kac formalism and path decomposition techniques we are able to find
the exact time-dependence of the probability distribution of the three
statistical quantities of interest. We show that a permeable barrier has a
large impact on these distributions at short times, but this impact is less
influential as time becomes long. In particular, the presence of a barrier
means that the three distributions are no longer identical with symmetry about
their means being broken. We also study a closely related statistical quantity,
namely, the distribution of the maximum displacement of a Brownian particle and
show that it deviates significantly from the usual half-Gaussian form.

an unknown $f$ from the concept class $C\subseteq \{f:\{0,1\}^n\rightarrow
[k]\}$ given copies of $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}}\sum_x \vert x,f(x)\rangle$. We
show that, if $T$ copies suffice to learn $f$ using entangled measurements,

  $\textbf{Entangled versus statistical measurements}$ The goal here is to
learn a function $f \in C$ given access to separable measurements and
statistical measurements. We exhibit a class $C$ that gives an exponential
separation between QSQ learning and quantum learning with entangled

classical SQ and PAC learning with classification noise.

equivalence. Under strong equivalence, we only allow adding ancillas carrying
the original on-site representation of the symmetry, while under stable
equivalence, we allow adding ancillas carrying any representation of the
symmetry. The former may be more realistic, because in physical systems
especially in AMO/quantum computing contexts, we would not expect additional
spins carrying arbitrary representations of the symmetry to be present.
Ref.~\onlinecite{mpu} proposed two kinds of symmetry-protected indices (SPIs)
for QCA with discrete symmetries under strong equivalence. In this note, we
show that the more refined of these SPIs still only has a one-to-one
correspondence to equivalence classes of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric QCA when $N$
is prime. We show a counter-example for $N=4$. We show that QCA with
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry under strong equivalence, for a given on-site
representation, are classified by $\mathbb{Z}^{pq}$ where $p$ is the number of
prime factors of the on-site Hilbert space dimension and $q$ is the number of
prime factors of the trace of the nontrivial on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2$ element.
Finally, we show that the GNVW index has a formulation in terms of a

flagella. The beat is thought to emerge from interactions between forces of the
surrounding fluid, passive elastic response from deformations of the flagellum,
and active forces from internal molecular motors. The beat varies in response
to changes in the fluid rheology, including elasticity, but there is limited
data on how systematic changes in elasticity alters the beat. This work
analyzes a related problem with fixed-strength driving force: the emergence of
beating of an elastic planar filament driven by a follower force at the tip in
a viscoelastic fluid. This analysis examines how the onset of oscillations
depends on the strength of the force and viscoelastic parameters. Compared to a
Newtonian fluid, it takes more force to induce the instability in viscoelastic
fluids, and the frequency of the oscillation is higher. The linear analysis
predicts that the frequency increases with the fluid relaxation time. Using
numerical simulations, the model predictions are compared with experimental
data on frequency changes in bi-flagellated alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. The
model shows the same trends in response to changes in both fluid viscosity and
Deborah number, and thus provides a mechanistic understanding of the
experimental observations.

  Methods: We defined a new loss function, called weighted loss function, in
the deep representation learning model to balance the importance of different
groups of patients and features. We applied the proposed model, called Fair
Patient Model (FPM), to a sample of 34,739 patients from the MIMIC-III dataset

  Results: FPM outperformed the baseline models in terms of three fairness

baselines, with an average accuracy of 0.7912. Feature analysis revealed that
FPM captured more information from clinical features than the baselines.
  Conclusion: FPM is a novel method to pre-train fair and unbiased patient

directed motion or work. We use molecular simulation to examine a family of
catenane molecular motors and to analyze their performance compared to the
physical limit provided by thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). By
varying the pair potentials and designs of the catenane motors, we find that
the precision of the molecular motor currents can vary over orders of
magnitude, but that precision is always observed to be far lower than the TUR
limit. We further quantitatively rationalize the deviation from the TUR bound,
illustrating that we can anticipate the degree to which a motor fails to
saturate the TUR in terms of four physical parameters: the chemical potential
driving the motor, the rate of fuel decomposition, the coupling between fuel
decomposition and motor motion, and the rate of undriven motor motion. The
analysis suggests that, for the catenane motors to become appreciably more
efficient with respect to the TUR, it will be necessary to (i) make the fueling
reaction less exergonic and (ii) couple the consumption of fuel more tightly to
biased motion.

significant limitation of weighted majority quorum systems lies in their
dependence on static weights, which are inappropriate for systems subject to
the dynamic nature of networked environments. To overcome this limitation, such
quorum systems require mechanisms for reassigning weights over time according
to the performance variations. We study the problem of node weight reassignment
in asynchronous systems with a static set of servers and static fault
threshold. We prove that solving such a problem is as hard as solving
consensus, i.e., it cannot be implemented in asynchronous failure-prone
distributed systems. This result is somewhat counter-intuitive, given the
recent results showing that two related problems -- replica set reconfiguration
and asset transfer -- can be solved in asynchronous systems. Inspired by these
problems, we present two versions of the problem that contain restrictions on
the weights of servers and the way they are reassigned. We propose a protocol
to implement one of the restricted problems in asynchronous systems. As a case
study, we construct a dynamic-weighted atomic storage based on such a protocol.
We also discuss the relationship between weight reassignment and asset transfer

mechanical properties of liquid crystal elastomers transitioning from the
nematic to isotropic phase when illuminated or heated. For the material
constitutive model, purely elastic and neoclassical-type strain energy
densities, applicable to a wide range of monodomain nematic elastomers, are

the effect of such patterns on the formation of convective cells. This
patterning is made possible by assuming the plates are chemically reactive or
release reagents into the fluid, both of which we model as chemical fluxes. We
consider this as a specific example of boundary-bound reactions. When the
chemical reagents do not produce significant solutal buoyancy forces, chemical
instabilities such as the diffusion-driven instabilities described by Turing
are still possible with nonlinear reactions. In the other extreme, constant
fluxes at the two plates do not produce diffusion-driven instabilities but
could give rise to hydrodynamic instabilities analogous to Rayleigh-Benard
instabilities. If we are able to influence the chemical fluxes along the domain
and select suitable reaction systems, then this presents a mechanism for the
control of chemical and hydrodynamic instabilities and pattern formation. We
study a generic class of models and find necessary conditions for a bifurcation
to pattern formation. Two examples derived from the Schnakenberg-Selkov
reaction are presented. Our results demonstrate that buoyancy-driven
instabilities can occur even in the absence of density variations in the steady
state. We also find parameter combinations that result in the formation of
convective cells whether gravity acts upwards or downwards relative to the

a wide range of the maximum rotation velocities (117 - 340 km s -1 ), with a
mean value of 200 km s -1 . In addition we found that the total stellar and
dynamical masses are in the range of log(M star /M sun ) = 10.1 - 11.5, with a

According to these results, barred galaxies exhibit similar behaviour to that
of normal spiral galaxies with respect to these relations, as well as in terms

to poor performance in high-dimensional settings. We propose stabJGL, which
equips the joint graphical lasso with a stable and accurate penalty parameter
selection approach that combines the notion of model stability with
likelihood-based similarity selection. The resulting method makes the powerful
joint graphical lasso available for use in omics settings, and outperforms the
standard joint graphical lasso, as well as state-of-the-art joint methods, in
terms of all performance measures we consider. Applying stabJGL to proteomic
data from a pan-cancer study, we demonstrate the potential for novel
discoveries the method brings. A user-friendly R package for stabJGL with

field topology in the solar source regions by taking advantage of
high-resolution observations. In this study, we employ a nonlinear force-free
field (NLFFF) extrapolation method based on a nonuniform grid setting for an
M-class flare eruption event (SOL2015-06-22T17:39) with embedded magnetograms
from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Goode Solar Telescope (GST).

with the simultaneous GST/H$\alpha$ and SDO/AIA observations for fine-scale
structures associated with precursor brightenings. Then we perform a
topological analysis of the field line connectivity corresponding to fine-scale

adversarial attacks, perturbations of the input that are imperceptible to
humans yet powerful enough to change the visual decision of a model.
Adversarial attacks have long been considered the ""Achilles' heel"" of deep
learning, which may eventually force a shift in modeling paradigms.
Nevertheless, the formidable capabilities of modern large-scale DNNs have
somewhat eclipsed these early concerns. Do adversarial attacks continue to pose
a threat to DNNs?
  Here, we investigate how the robustness of DNNs to adversarial attacks has
evolved as their accuracy on ImageNet has continued to improve. We measure
adversarial robustness in two different ways: First, we measure the smallest
adversarial attack needed to cause a model to change its object categorization
decision. Second, we measure how aligned successful attacks are with the
features that humans find diagnostic for object recognition. We find that
adversarial attacks are inducing bigger and more easily detectable changes to
image pixels as DNNs grow better on ImageNet, but these attacks are also
becoming less aligned with features that humans find diagnostic for
recognition. To better understand the source of this trade-off, we turn to the
neural harmonizer, a DNN training routine that encourages models to leverage
the same features as humans to solve tasks. Harmonized DNNs achieve the best of
both worlds and experience attacks that are detectable and affect features that
humans find diagnostic for recognition, meaning that attacks on these models
are more likely to be rendered ineffective by inducing similar effects on human
perception. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of DNNs to adversarial
attacks can be mitigated by DNN scale, data scale, and training routines that
align models with biological intelligence.

of red galaxies, when moving to denser environments, is driven by the red
massive normal-size galaxies. Red nuggets, similarly to red intermediate-mass

found in various types of environments, with consistent (within $1\sigma$)
fractions across all local densities. Analysis of red nugget stellar ages
suggests that relics are preferably found in high-density regions while
quiescent red nuggets are overabundant in low-density environments. We
speculate that red nuggets have survived to lower redshifts via two channels:
i) in low-density environments where the fraction of red nuggets decreases as
time passes due to (very) limited merger activity, ii) in high-density
environments, where the number of red nuggets drops at higher redshift due to
merger activity and is preserved at lower redshift as the high velocities of

  Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 23)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep Learning (DL) models to analyze source code have shown immense promise
during the past few years. More recently, self-supervised pre-training has
gained traction for learning generic code representations valuable for many
downstream SE tasks, such as clone and bug detection.
  While previous work successfully learned from different code abstractions
(e.g., token, AST, graph), we argue that it is also essential to factor in how
developers code day-to-day for general-purpose representation learning. On the
one hand, human developers tend to write repetitive programs referencing
existing code snippets from the current codebase or online resources (e.g.,
Stack Overflow website) rather than implementing functions from scratch; such
behaviors result in a vast number of code clones. In contrast, a deviant clone
by mistake might trigger malicious program behaviors.
  Thus, as a proxy to incorporate developers' coding behavior into the
pre-training scheme, we propose to include code clones and their deviants. In
particular, we propose CONCORD, a self-supervised, contrastive learning
strategy to place benign clones closer in the representation space while moving
deviants further apart. We show that CONCORD's clone-aware contrastive learning
drastically reduces the need for expensive pre-training resources while

increasing attention in recent years. Current methods use some combination of
global novelty bonuses, computed using the agent's entire training experience,
and \textit{episodic novelty bonuses}, computed using only experience from the
current episode. However, the use of these two types of bonuses has been ad-hoc
and poorly understood. In this work, we shed light on the behavior of these two
types of bonuses through controlled experiments on easily interpretable tasks
as well as challenging pixel-based settings. We find that the two types of
bonuses succeed in different settings, with episodic bonuses being most
effective when there is little shared structure across episodes and global
bonuses being effective when more structure is shared. We develop a conceptual
framework which makes this notion of shared structure precise by considering
the variance of the value function across contexts, and which provides a
unifying explanation of our empirical results. We furthermore find that
combining the two bonuses can lead to more robust performance across different
degrees of shared structure, and investigate different algorithmic choices for
defining and combining global and episodic bonuses based on function
approximation. This results in an algorithm which sets a new state of the art
across 16 tasks from the MiniHack suite used in prior work, and also performs
robustly on Habitat and Montezuma's Revenge.

architecture for realizing quantum queries. However, implementing QRAM in

  In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end system architecture for QRAM.
First, we introduce a novel QRAM that hybridizes two existing implementations
and achieves asymptotically superior scaling in space (qubit number) and time
(circuit depth). Like in classical virtual memory, our construction enables
queries to a virtual address space larger than what is actually available in
hardware. Second, we present a compilation framework to synthesize, map, and

demonstrate how to embed large-scale QRAM on a 2D Euclidean space, such as a
grid layout, with minimal routing overhead. Third, we show how to leverage the
intrinsic biased-noise resilience of the proposed QRAM for implementation on
either Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) or Fault-Tolerant Quantum

that in a linear graph, the number of ``sections'' (a sequence of consecutive

is crucial for predicting laminar to turbulent boundary layer transition.
Input-output analysis as a receptivity tool considers which free-stream
disturbances lead to the largest response from the boundary layer using the
global linear dynamics. Two technical challenges are addressed. First, we
extend recent work by Kamal et al (Kamal 2023) and restrict the allowable
forcing to physically realizable inputs via a free-stream boundary modification
to the classic input-output formulation. Second, we develop a hierarchical
input-output (H-IO) analysis which allows us to solve the three-dimensional
problem at a fraction of the computational cost otherwise associated with
directly inverting the fully three-dimensional resolvent operator. Next, we
consider Mach 5.8 flows over a sharp cone and blunt cone with a 3.6 mm
spherically blunt tip. H-IO correctly predicts that the sharp cone boundary
layer is most receptive to slow acoustic waves at an optimal incidence angle of
10 degrees, validating the method. We then investigate the effect of
free-stream disturbances on the blunt cone boundary layer, and identify two
distinct vorticity-dominated receptivity mechanisms for the oblique first mode
instability at 10 kHz and an entropy layer instability at 75 kHz. Our results
reveal these receptivity processes to be highly three-dimensional in nature,
involving both the nose-tip and excitation along narrow bands at certain
azimuthal angles along the oblique shock downstream. We interpret these
processes in terms of critical angles from linear shock/perturbation
interaction theory.

graph-structured data. However, recent empirical studies suggest that GNNs are
very susceptible to distribution shift. There is still significant ambiguity
about why graph-based models seem more vulnerable to these shifts. In this work
we provide a thorough theoretical analysis on it by quantifying the magnitude
of conditional shift between the input features and the output label. Our
findings show that both graph heterophily and model architecture exacerbate
conditional shifts, leading to performance degradation. To address this, we
propose an approach that involves estimating and minimizing the conditional
shift for unsupervised domain adaptation on graphs. In our controlled synthetic
experiments, our algorithm demonstrates robustness towards distribution shift,
resulting in up to 10% absolute ROC AUC improvement versus the second-best
algorithm. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments on both node classification
and graph classification show its robust performance under various distribution
shifts.

synthetic data that approximate the statistical properties of an underlying
sensitive dataset. In recent years, there has been a growing line of work that
approaches this problem using first-order optimization techniques. However,
such techniques are restricted to optimizing differentiable objectives only,
severely limiting the types of analyses that can be conducted. For example,
first-order mechanisms have been primarily successful in approximating
statistical queries only in the form of marginals for discrete data domains. In
some cases, one can circumvent such issues by relaxing the task's objective to
maintain differentiability. However, even when possible, these approaches
impose a fundamental limitation in which modifications to the minimization
problem become additional sources of error. Therefore, we propose Private-GSD,
a private genetic algorithm based on zeroth-order optimization heuristics that
do not require modifying the original objective. As a result, it avoids the
aforementioned limitations of first-order optimization. We empirically evaluate
Private-GSD against baseline algorithms on data derived from the American
Community Survey across a variety of statistics--otherwise known as statistical
queries--both for discrete and real-valued attributes. We show that Private-GSD
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on non-differential queries while

adsorption (RSA) protocol built of identical rectangles deposited on a flat,
continuous plane. An aspect ratio of rectangles is defined as the
length-to-width ratio, $f=l/w$. The rectangles have a fixed unit area (i.e., $l
\times w=1$), and therefore, their shape is defined by the value of $f$
($l=\sqrt{f}$ and $w=1/\sqrt{f}$). The rectangles are allowed to align either
vertically or horizontally with equal probability. The particles are deposited
on a flat square substrate of side length $L$ (measured in units of particle
length, $L \in [20, 1000]$) and periodic boundary conditions are applied along
both directions. The finite-size scaling effects are characterized by a scaled
anisotropy defined as $\alpha = l/L = \sqrt{f}/L$. We showed that the
properties of such packings strongly depend on the value of aspect ratio $f$
and the most significant scaling effects are observed for relatively long
rectangles when $l\ge L/2$ (i.e. $\alpha \ge 0.5$). It is especially visible
for the mean packing fraction as a function of the scaled anisotropy $\alpha$.
The kinetics of packing growth for low to moderate rectangle anisotropy is to
be governed by $\ln t/t$ law, where $t$ is proportional to the number of RSA
iterations, which is the same as in the case of RSA of parallel squares. We
also analyzed global orientational ordering in such packings and properties of
domains consisting of a set of neighboring rectangles of the same orientation,

framework of graph neural networks (GNNs) in recent years. However, their
expressive power is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test.
Some works are inspired by $k$-WL/FWL (Folklore WL) and design the
corresponding neural versions. Despite the high expressive power, there are
serious limitations in this line of research. In particular, (1) $k$-WL/FWL
requires at least $O(n^k)$ space complexity, which is impractical for large
graphs even when $k=3$; (2) The design space of $k$-WL/FWL is rigid, with the
only adjustable hyper-parameter being $k$. To tackle the first limitation, we
propose an extension, $(k, t)$-FWL. We theoretically prove that even if we fix
the space complexity to $O(n^2)$ in $(k, t)$-FWL, we can construct an
expressiveness hierarchy up to solving the graph isomorphism problem. To tackle
the second problem, we propose $k$-FWL+, which considers any equivariant set as
neighbors instead of all nodes, thereby greatly expanding the design space of
$k$-FWL. Combining these two modifications results in a flexible and powerful
framework $(k, t)$-FWL+. We demonstrate $(k, t)$-FWL+ can implement most
existing models with matching expressiveness. We then introduce an instance of
$(k,t)$-FWL+ called Neighborhood$^2$-FWL (N$^2$-FWL), which is practically and
theoretically sound. We prove that N$^2$-FWL is no less powerful than 3-WL, can
encode many substructures while only requiring $O(n^2)$ space. Finally, we
design its neural version named N$^2$-GNN and evaluate its performance on
various tasks. N$^2$-GNN achieves superior performance on almost all tasks,
with record-breaking results on ZINC-Subset (0.059) and ZINC-Full (0.013),
outperforming previous state-of-the-art results by 10.6% and 40.9%,

both NLP and software engineering. Models in OpenAI's GPT series now dwarf
Google's BERT and Meta's RoBERTa, which previously set new benchmarks on a wide
range of NLP applications. These models are trained on massive corpora of
heterogeneous data from web crawls, which enables them to learn general
language patterns and semantic relationships. However, the largest models are
both expensive to train and deploy and are often closed-source, so we lack
access to their data and design decisions. We argue that this trend towards
large, general-purpose models should be complemented with single-purpose, more
modestly sized pre-trained models. In this work, we take StackOverflow (SO) as
a domain example in which large volumes of rich aligned code and text data is
available. We adopt standard practices for pre-training large language models,
including using a very large context size (2,048 tokens), batch size (0.5M

(Megatron-LM), to train two models: SOBertBase, with 109M parameters, and
SOBertLarge with 762M parameters, at a budget of just $\$187$ and $\$800$ each.
We compare the performance of our models with both the previous SOTA model
trained on SO data exclusively as well general-purpose BERT models and OpenAI's
ChatGPT on four SO-specific downstream tasks - question quality prediction,
closed question prediction, named entity recognition and obsoletion prediction
(a new task we introduce). Not only do our models consistently outperform all

radiation-induced necrosis (RN) or recurrent brain tumor (rBT). Screening for

better outcomes for the patients. Differentiating rBT from RN is challenging as

Moreover, learning-based rBT versus RN classification using MRI may suffer from
class imbalance due to lack of patient data. While synthetic data generation
using generative models has shown promise to address class imbalance, the
underlying data representation may be different in synthetic or augmented data.
This study proposes computational modeling with statistically rigorous repeated

demonstrate the feasibility of using MRF radiomic features as a non-invasive
biomarker to identify patients who are at higher risk of recurrence or
radiation necrosis. The cross-validated results show that the MRF model
provides the best overall performance with an AUC of 0.770+-.032.

featuring seven of the eight NIRCam broadband filters, 2) wide-field slitless
spectroscopy (WFSS) at a resolving power of $\sim$150 between 0.8 and 2.2
$\mu$m, 3) single-object cross-dispersed slitless spectroscopy (SOSS) enabling
simultaneous wavelength coverage between 0.6 and 2.8 $\mu$m at R$\sim$700, a
mode optimized for exoplanet spectroscopy of relatively bright ($J<6.3$) stars
and 4) aperture masking interferometry (AMI) between 2.8 and 4.8 $\mu$m
enabling high-contrast ($\sim10^{-3}-10^{-4}$) imaging at angular separations
between 70 and 400 milliarcsec for relatively bright ($M<8$) sources. This
paper presents an overview of the NIRISS instrument, its design, its scientific
capabilities, and a summary of in-flight performance. NIRISS shows
significantly better response shortward of $\sim2.5\,\mu$m resulting in 10-40%
sensitivity improvement for broadband and low-resolution spectroscopy compared
to pre-flight predictions. Two time-series observations performed during
instrument commissioning in the SOSS mode yield very stable spectro-photometry
performance within $\sim$10% of the expected noise. The first space-based
companion detection of the tight binary star AB Dor AC through AMI was
demonstrated.

mount, foreseeing the downstream effects of deploying AI systems remains a
challenging task. We developed AHA! (Anticipating Harms of AI), a generative
framework to assist AI practitioners and decision-makers in anticipating
potential harms and unintended consequences of AI systems prior to development
or deployment. Given an AI deployment scenario, AHA! generates descriptions of
possible harms for different stakeholders. To do so, AHA! systematically
considers the interplay between common problematic AI behaviors as well as
their potential impacts on different stakeholders, and narrates these
conditions through vignettes. These vignettes are then filled in with
descriptions of possible harms by prompting crowd workers and large language
models. By examining 4113 harms surfaced by AHA! for five different AI
deployment scenarios, we found that AHA! generates meaningful examples of
harms, with different problematic AI behaviors resulting in different types of
harms. Prompting both crowds and a large language model with the vignettes
resulted in more diverse examples of harms than those generated by either the
crowd or the model alone. To gauge AHA!'s potential practical utility, we also
conducted semi-structured interviews with responsible AI professionals (N=9).
Participants found AHA!'s systematic approach to surfacing harms important for
ethical reflection and discovered meaningful stakeholders and harms they
believed they would not have thought of otherwise. Participants, however,
differed in their opinions about whether AHA! should be used upfront or as a
secondary-check and noted that AHA! may shift harm anticipation from an
ideation problem to a potentially demanding review problem. Drawing on our
results, we discuss design implications of building tools to help practitioners
envision possible harms.

computation to the inclusion of application specific integrated circuits
(ASICs), such as Tensor Cores and Ray Tracing (RT) cores. Although these
special purpose GPU cores were designed to further accelerate specific fields
such as AI and real-time rendering, recent research has managed to exploit them
to further accelerate other tasks that typically used regular GPU computing. In
this work we present RTXRMQ, a new approach that can compute range minimum
queries (RMQs) with RT cores. The main contribution is the proposal of a
geometric solution for RMQ, where elements become triangles that are placed and
shaped according to the element's value and position in the array,
respectively, such that the closest hit of a ray launched from a point given by
the query parameters corresponds to the result of that query. Experimental
results show that RTXRMQ is currently best suited for small query ranges
relative to the problem size, achieving up to $5\times$ and $2.3\times$ of
speedup over state of the art CPU (HRMQ) and GPU (LCA) approaches,
respectively. Although for medium and large query ranges RTXRMQ is currently
surpassed by LCA, it is still competitive by being $2.5\times$ and $4\times$
faster than HRMQ which is a highly parallel CPU approach. Furthermore,
performance scaling experiments across the latest RTX GPU architectures show
that if the current RT scaling trend continues, then RTXRMQ's performance would
scale at a higher rate than HRMQ and LCA, making the approach even more
relevant for future high performance applications that employ batches of RMQs.

learning (RL) algorithms: on many benchmark datasets, offline RL can produce
well-performing and safe policies even when trained with ""wrong"" reward labels,
such as those that are zero everywhere or are negatives of the true rewards.
This phenomenon cannot be easily explained by offline RL's return maximization
objective. Moreover, it gives offline RL a degree of robustness that is
uncharacteristic of its online RL counterparts, which are known to be sensitive
to reward design. We demonstrate that this surprising robustness property is
attributable to an interplay between the notion of pessimism in offline RL
algorithms and a certain bias implicit in common data collection practices. As
we prove in this work, pessimism endows the agent with a ""survival instinct"",
i.e., an incentive to stay within the data support in the long term, while the
limited and biased data coverage further constrains the set of survival
policies. Formally, given a reward class -- which may not even contain the true
reward -- we identify conditions on the training data distribution that enable
offline RL to learn a near-optimal and safe policy from any reward within the
class. We argue that the survival instinct should be taken into account when
interpreting results from existing offline RL benchmarks and when creating
future ones. Our empirical and theoretical results suggest a new paradigm for
RL, whereby an agent is ""nudged"" to learn a desirable behavior with imperfect
reward but purposely biased data coverage.

In this paper, we demonstrate an efficient spectral approach to the simulation

CFTD provides excellent agreement with finite-difference integration of the

chaos. We also develop a modal linear stability analysis using CFTD to
efficiently predict multimode instabilities in lasers. The combination of

easy parameter estimation, but are parameter intensive when modeling long

while ameliorating the weaknesses. SALT parameterizes the tensor of an ARHMM

longer range dependencies without overfitting. We prove theoretical and discuss

experiments, intense electron-capture sources were fabricated to measure the
responses of the radiochemical SAGE and GALLEX/GNO detectors to known fluxes of
low-energy neutrinos. Such tests were viewed at the time as a cross-check,
given the many tests of $^{71}$Ge recovery and counting that had been routinely
performed, with excellent results. However, the four $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar
source experiments yielded rates below expectations, a result commonly known as
the Ga anomaly. As the intensity of the electron-capture sources can be
measured to high precision, the neutrino lines they produce are fixed by known
atomic and nuclear rates, and the neutrino absorption cross section on
$^{71}$Ga is tightly constrained by the lifetime of $^{71}$Ge, no simple
explanation for the anomaly has been found. To check these calibration
experiments, a dedicated experiment BEST was performed, utilizing a neutrino
source of unprecedented intensity and a detector optimized to increase
statistics while providing some information on counting rate as a function of
distance from the source. The results BEST obtained are consistent with the
earlier solar neutrino calibration experiments, and when combined with those
measurements, yield a Ga anomaly with a significance of approximately
$4\sigma$, under conservative assumptions. But BEST found no evidence of
distance dependence and thus no explicit indication of new physics. In this
review we describe the extensive campaigns carried out by SAGE, GALLEX/GNO, and
BEST to demonstrate the reliability and precision of their experimental
procedures, including $^{71}$Ge recovery, counting, and analysis. We also
describe efforts to define uncertainties in the neutrino capture cross section.
With the results from BEST, an anomaly remains.

have additional knowledge about the target distribution which constrains the

framework that enables statistical inference in the presence of distribution
shifts which obey user-specified constraints in the form of functions whose
expectation is known under the target distribution. The output is
high-probability bounds on the value an estimand takes on the target

which are thicker than wires usually fielded on wire array experiments. To test
ablation with thicker wires, we perform a parametric study by varying the

efficiently transfer declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, or the
mixture of both; 2) how to design effective policy architectures and 3)
effective algorithms for LLDM; 4) the robustness of a lifelong learner with

However, the current accuracy rate in behavior detection is low. To address
this challenge, we propose the Student Classroom Behavior Detection method,
based on improved YOLOv7. First, we created the Student Classroom Behavior
dataset (SCB-Dataset), which includes 18.4k labels and 4.2k images, covering
three behaviors: hand raising, reading, and writing. To improve detection
accuracy in crowded scenes, we integrated the biformer attention module and
Wise-IoU into the YOLOv7 network. Finally, experiments were conducted on the
SCB-Dataset, and the model achieved an mAP@0.5 of 79%, resulting in a 1.8%
improvement over previous results. The SCB-Dataset and code are available for

construct a reference sample of Li-normal (doppelg\""anger) stars with matched
evolutionary state and fiducial supernova abundances. Comparing Li-rich and
doppelg\""anger spectra reveals systematic differences in the H-$\alpha$ and
Ca-triplet line profiles associated with the velocity broadening measurement.
We also find twice as many Li-rich stars appear to be fast rotators (2% with
$v_\textrm{broad} \gtrsim 20$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to doppelg\""angers. On
average, Li-rich stars have higher abundances than their doppelg\""angers, for a
subset of elements, and Li-rich stars at the base of RGB have higher mean
$s-$process abundances ($\geq 0.05$ dex for Ba, Y, Zr), relative to their
doppelg\""angers. External mass-transfer from intermediate-mass AGB companions
could explain this signature. Additional companion analysis excludes binaries
with mass ratios $\gtrsim$ 0.5 at $\gtrsim$ 7 AU. We also discover that highly
Ba-enriched stars are missing from the Li-rich population, possibly due to
low-mass AGB companions which preclude Li-enrichment. Finally, we confirm a
prevalence of Li-rich stars on the red clump that increases with lithium, which
supports an evolutionary state mechanism for Li-enhancement. Multiple culprits,

we present an optimization problem that configures networked microgrids to

neutron-rich nuclei, immersed in a sea of superfluid neutrons with background
relativistic electron gas. A proper quantum mechanical treatment for such a
system under a periodic potential is the band theory of solids. The effect of
band structure on the effective mass of dripped neutrons, the so-called
\textit{entrainment effect}, is currently in a debatable situation, and it has
been highly desired to develop a nuclear band theory taking into account
neutron superfluidity in a fully self-consistent manner.
  Purpose: The main purpose of the present work is twofold: 1) to develop a
formalism of the time-dependent self-consistent band theory, taking full
account of nuclear superfluidity, based on time-dependent density functional
theory (TDDFT) extended for superfluid systems, and 2) to quantify the effects
of band structure and superfluidity on crustal properties, applying the
formalism to the slab phase of nuclear matter in the $\beta$ equilibrium.
  Results: Static calculations have been performed for a range of baryon
(nucleon) number density ($n_b=0.04$--0.07 fm$^{-3}$) under the
$\beta$-equilibrium condition with and without superfluidity, for various
inter-slab spacings. From a dynamic response to an external potential, we
extract the collective mass of a slab and that of protons immersed in neutron
superfluid. From the results, we find that the collective mass of a slab is
substantially reduced by 57.5--82.5\% for $n_b=0.04$--0.07 fm$^{-3}$, which
corresponds to an enhancement of conduction neutron number density and, thus,
to a reduction of the neutron effective mass, which we call the
anti-entrainment effect. We discuss novel phenomena associated with
superfluidity, quasiparticle resonances in the inner crust, which are absent in
normal systems.

non-binding samples and exact amino acid sequences. To overcome these
limitations, we have developed AVIDa-hIL6, a large-scale dataset for predicting
antigen-antibody interactions in the variable domain of heavy chain of heavy
chain antibodies (VHHs), produced from an alpaca immunized with the human
interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein, as antigens. By leveraging the simple structure
of VHHs, which facilitates identification of full-length amino acid sequences
by DNA sequencing technology, AVIDa-hIL6 contains 573,891 antigen-VHH pairs
with amino acid sequences. All the antigen-VHH pairs have reliable labels for

via introduction of artificial mutations, AVIDa-hIL6 contains 30 different
mutants in addition to wild-type IL-6 protein. This characteristic provides
opportunities to develop machine learning models for predicting changes in
antibody binding by antigen mutations. We report experimental benchmark results
on AVIDa-hIL6 by using neural network-based baseline models. The results
indicate that the existing models have potential, but further research is

bins that are dominated by Poisson noise and find that the model can tolerate
the frequency-bin removal up to $\sim 10$ bins to maintain a prediction
accuracy of $R^{2} > 0.9$. The black hole mass and inclination should be fixed
so that the accuracy in predicting the source height is still $> 0.9$. The

both AGN are then predicted using the RFR model developed from the simulated

the encoder-projector framework (e.g., SimCLR) used in contrastive learning. We
aim to demystify the observed phenomenon where representations learned before
projectors outperform those learned after -- measured using the downstream
linear classification accuracy, even when the projectors themselves are linear.
  In this paper, we make two significant contributions towards this aim.
Firstly, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we identify two crucial
effects -- expansion and shrinkage -- induced by the contrastive loss on the
projectors. In essence, contrastive loss either expands or shrinks the signal
direction in the representations learned by an encoder, depending on factors
such as the augmentation strength, the temperature used in contrastive loss,
etc. Secondly, drawing inspiration from the expansion and shrinkage phenomenon,
we propose a family of linear transformations to accurately model the
projector's behavior. This enables us to precisely characterize the downstream
linear classification accuracy in the high-dimensional asymptotic limit. Our
findings reveal that linear projectors operating in the shrinkage (or
expansion) regime hinder (or improve) the downstream classification accuracy.
This provides the first theoretical explanation as to why (linear) projectors
impact the downstream performance of learned representations. Our theoretical
findings are further corroborated by extensive experiments on both synthetic
data and real image data.

we must scale currently demonstrated quantum computers up significantly.
Leading platforms such as trapped ions face physical challenges in including
more information carriers. A less explored avenue for scaling up the
computational space involves utilizing the rich energy level structure of a
trapped ion to encode multi-level qudits rather than two-level qubits. Here we
show control and single-shot readout of qudits with up to 13 computational
states, using protocols which can be extended directly to manipulate qudits of
up to 25 levels in our chosen information host, $^{137}\text{Ba}^{+}$. This
represents more than twice as many computational states per qudit compared with
prior work in trapped ions. In addition to the preparation and readout
protocols we demonstrate, universal quantum computation requires other quantum
logic primitives such as entangling gates. These primitives have been
demonstrated for lower qudit dimensions and can be directly generalized to the
higher dimensions we employ. Hence, our advance opens an avenue towards using
high-dimensional qudits for large-scale quantum computation. We anticipate
efficiently utilizing available energy states in a trapped ion to play a
significant and complementary role in tackling the challenge in scaling up the
computational space of a trapped ion quantum computer. A qudit architecture
also offers other practical benefits, which include affording relaxed fault
tolerance thresholds for quantum error correction, providing an avenue for
efficient quantum simulation of higher spin systems, and more efficient qubit

not show ultrahigh electrostrain if the thickness of the discs is above 0.3 mm
(the disc diameters were in the range 10- 12 mm diameter). The ultrahigh strain

electrostrain obtained from specimens designed to exhibit defect dipoles with
specimens that were not designed to have defect dipoles in Na0.5Bi0.5TiO3 (NBT)

off-nucleus AGNs. Studying such systems is essential to learn the dynamical

novel astrometry-based method named varstrometry has been put forward to search
for dual SMBHs at high redshift, as the unsynchronized flux variability of dual
AGNs (or off-nucleus AGNs) will cause astrometric jitters detectable by Gaia
without spatially resolving them. Based on Gaia varstrometry we select a rare
sample of 5 radio loud quasars with clear Gaia astrometric jitters. With
e-MERLIN observations we have revealed a single compact radio source for each
of them. Remarkably all but one exhibit clear Gaia-radio offsets of ~ 9 -- 60

These detected Gaia-radio offsets suggest these candidate dual SMBHs may have

their training efficiency in online tasks, but challenging due to the inherent

sidesteps the accompanied action records in offline datasets and instead
focuses on pretraining a task-irrelevant, action-free world model within the

transfer valuable action-conditioned dynamics and potentially useful action
demonstrations from offline to online settings. The main idea is to use the
world models not only as simulators for behavior learning but also as tools to
measure the domain relevance for both dynamics representation transfer and
policy transfer. Specifically, we train the world models to generate a set of
time-varying task similarities using a domain-selective knowledge distillation
loss. These similarities serve two purposes: (i) adaptively transferring the
most useful source knowledge to facilitate dynamics learning, and (ii) learning
to replay the most relevant source actions to guide the target policy. We
demonstrate the advantages of Vid2Act over the action-free visual RL
pretraining method in both Meta-World and DeepMind Control Suite.

learning (RL) to balance the policy's performance and interaction costs. In

catastrophic for high-stake scenarios like healthcare and autonomous driving.
In this work, we introduce an interaction-free training scheme dubbed
Offline-with-Action-Preferences (OAP). The main insight is that, compared to
online fine-tuning, querying the preferences between pre-collected and learned

By adaptively encouraging or suppressing policy constraint according to action
preferences, OAP could distinguish overestimation from beneficial policy
improvement and thus attains a more accurate evaluation of unseen data.
Theoretically, we prove a lower bound of the behavior policy's performance
improvement brought by OAP. Moreover, comprehensive experiments on the D4RL

localization in the brain, with different anatomical regions preferentially
activating for different types of sensory input. Many such localized structures
are known, including the fusiform face area and parahippocampal place area.
This raises the question of whether additional brain regions (or conjunctions
of brain regions) are also specialized for other important semantic concepts.
To identify such brain regions, we developed a data-driven approach to uncover
visual concepts that are decodable from a massive functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) dataset. Our analysis is broadly split into three sections.
First, a fully connected neural network is trained to map brain responses to
the outputs of an image-language foundation model, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021).
Subsequently, a contrastive-learning dimensionality reduction method reveals
the brain-decodable components of CLIP space. In the final section of our
analysis, we localize shared decodable concepts in the brain using a
voxel-masking optimization method to produce a shared decodable concept (SDC)
space. The accuracy of our procedure is validated by comparing it to previous
localization experiments that identify regions for faces, bodies, and places.
In addition to these concepts, whose corresponding brain regions were already
known, we localize novel concept representations which are shared across
participants to other areas of the human brain. We also demonstrate how this
method can be used to inspect fine-grained semantic networks for individual
participants. We envisage that this extensible method can also be adapted to

specific model for a specific low input resolution for optimal results. By
contrast, we explore in this work a unified framework that is trained once and
then used to super-resolve input face images of varied low resolutions. For
that purpose, we propose a novel neural network architecture that is composed
of three anchor auto-encoders, one feature weight regressor and a final image
decoder. The three anchor auto-encoders are meant for optimal FSR for three
pre-defined low input resolutions, or named anchor resolutions, respectively.
An input face image of an arbitrary low resolution is firstly up-scaled to the
target resolution by bi-cubic interpolation and then fed to the three
auto-encoders in parallel. The three encoded anchor features are then fused
with weights determined by the feature weight regressor. At last, the fused
feature is sent to the final image decoder to derive the super-resolution
result. As shown by experiments, the proposed algorithm achieves robust and
state-of-the-art performance over a wide range of low input resolutions by a
single framework. Code and models will be made available after the publication
of this work.

approach for perturbing phase information during the training of time-domain CM
systems. Communication networks often employ lossy compression codec that
encodes only magnitude information, therefore heavily altering phase
information. Also, state-of-the-art CM systems rely on phase information to
identify spoofed speech. Thus, we believe the information loss in the phase
domain induced by lossy compression codec degrades the performance of the
unseen channel. We first establish the dependence of time-domain CM systems on
phase information by perturbing phase in evaluation, showing strong
degradation. Then, we demonstrated that perturbing phase during training leads
to a significant performance improvement, whereas perturbing magnitude leads to
further degradation.

user engagement in video recommender systems. To achieve this, there are four
properties that a watch time prediction framework should satisfy: first,
despite its continuous value, watch time is also an ordinal variable and the
relative ordering between its values reflects the differences in user
preferences. Therefore the ordinal relations should be reflected in watch time
predictions. Second, the conditional dependence between the video-watching
behaviors should be captured in the model. For instance, one has to watch half
of the video before he/she finishes watching the whole video. Third, modeling
watch time with a point estimation ignores the fact that models might give
results with high uncertainty and this could cause bad cases in recommender
systems. Therefore the framework should be aware of prediction uncertainty.
Forth, the real-life recommender systems suffer from severe bias amplifications
thus an estimation without bias amplification is expected. Therefore we propose
TPM for watch time prediction. Specifically, the ordinal ranks of watch time
are introduced into TPM and the problem is decomposed into a series of
conditional dependent classification tasks which are organized into a tree
structure. The expectation of watch time can be generated by traversing the
tree and the variance of watch time predictions is explicitly introduced into
the objective function as a measurement for uncertainty. Moreover, we
illustrate that backdoor adjustment can be seamlessly incorporated into TPM,
which alleviates bias amplifications. Extensive offline evaluations have been
conducted in public datasets and TPM have been deployed in a real-world video
app Kuaishou with over 300 million DAUs. The results indicate that TPM
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and indeed improves video consumption
significantly.

  Federated Averaging",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC cs.IT math.IT math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In federated learning (FL), clients usually have diverse participation
probabilities that are unknown a priori, which can significantly harm the
performance of FL if not handled properly. Existing works aiming at addressing
this problem are usually based on global variance reduction, which requires a
substantial amount of additional memory in a multiplicative factor equal to the
total number of clients. An important open problem is to find a lightweight
method for FL in the presence of clients with unknown participation rates. In
this paper, we address this problem by adapting the aggregation weights in
federated averaging (FedAvg) based on the participation history of each client.
We first show that, with heterogeneous participation probabilities, FedAvg with
non-optimal aggregation weights can diverge from the optimal solution of the
original FL objective, indicating the need of finding optimal aggregation
weights. However, it is difficult to compute the optimal weights when the
participation probabilities are unknown. To address this problem, we present a
new algorithm called FedAU, which improves FedAvg by adaptively weighting the
client updates based on online estimates of the optimal weights without knowing
the probabilities of client participation. We provide a theoretical convergence
analysis of FedAU using a novel methodology to connect the estimation error and
convergence. Our theoretical results reveal important and interesting insights,
while showing that FedAU converges to an optimal solution of the original
objective and has desirable properties such as linear speedup. Our experimental
results also verify the advantage of FedAU over baseline methods.

both theory and practice; however, dealing with instance (i.e., feature) and

arises from the fact that the noise rate varies for each instance, making it
challenging to estimate accurately. The question of whether it is possible to
learn a reliable model using only noisy samples remains unresolved. We answer
this question with a theoretical analysis that provides matching upper and
lower bounds. Surprisingly, our results show that, without any additional
assumptions, empirical risk minimization achieves the optimal excess risk
bound. Specifically, we derive a novel excess risk bound proportional to the
noise level, which holds in very general settings, by comparing the empirical
risk minimizers obtained from clean samples and noisy samples. Second, we show
that the minimax lower bound for the 0-1 loss is a constant proportional to the
average noise rate. Our findings suggest that learning solely with noisy
samples is impossible without access to clean samples or strong assumptions on
the distribution of the data.

drop a lot when inputting panoramic images with the 3D disturbance. To be more
robust to 3D disturbance, we propose our Spherical Geometry-Aware Transformer

spherical geometry-aware constraint on the existing deformable patch embedding,

Experimental results on Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets show that SGAT4PASS

often underperform on complex and long videos in real world, primarily due to
two factors. Firstly, offline methods are limited by the tightly-coupled
modeling paradigm, which treats all frames equally and disregards the
interdependencies between adjacent frames. Consequently, this leads to the
introduction of excessive noise during long-term temporal alignment. Secondly,
online methods suffer from inadequate utilization of temporal information. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a decoupling strategy for VIS by dividing
it into three independent sub-tasks: segmentation, tracking, and refinement.
The efficacy of the decoupling strategy relies on two crucial elements: 1)
attaining precise long-term alignment outcomes via frame-by-frame association
during tracking, and 2) the effective utilization of temporal information
predicated on the aforementioned accurate alignment outcomes during refinement.
We introduce a novel referring tracker and temporal refiner to construct the

SOTA performance in both VIS and VPS, surpassing the current SOTA methods by

trial solution for GL relaxation method. In consecutive steps we increase the
nonlinear term in the GL equation which results in achieving a stable approach

accurately localizing moments, i.e., the query should provide precise
information about the target moment so that the localization model can
understand what to look for in the videos. However, the natural language
queries in current datasets may not be easy to understand for existing models.
For example, the Ego4D dataset uses question sentences as the query to describe
relatively complex moments. While being natural and straightforward for humans,
understanding such question sentences are challenging for mainstream moment
localization models like 2D-TAN. Inspired by the recent success of large
language models, especially their ability of understanding and generating
complex natural language contents, in this extended abstract, we make early
attempts at reformulating the moment queries into a set of instructions using
large language models and making them more friendly to the localization models.

examination of responses reveals that refusal is not cleanly binary, and lies
on a continuum; as such, we map several different kinds of responses to a
binary of compliance or refusal. The small manually-labeled dataset is used to
train a refusal classifier, which achieves an accuracy of 92%. Second, we use
this refusal classifier to bootstrap a larger (n=10,000) dataset adapted from
the Quora Insincere Questions dataset. With this machine-labeled data, we train
a prompt classifier to predict whether ChatGPT will refuse a given question,
without seeing ChatGPT's response. This prompt classifier achieves 76% accuracy

researchers have utilized pre-trained denoising diffusion probabilistic models

months of training time and a substantial volume of unlabeled remote sensing

change map. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end
DDPM-based model architecture called change-aware diffusion model (CADM), which

  interchange reconnection",,,,,"astro-ph.SR physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The role of interchange reconnection as a drive mechanism for the solar wind
is explored by solving the global magnetic-field-aligned equations describing
wind acceleration. Boundary conditions in the low corona, including a
reconnection-driven Alfv\'enic outflow and associated heating differ from
previous models. Additional heating of the corona associated with Alfv\'en
waves or other MHD turbulence, which has been the foundation of many earlier
models, is neglected. For this simplified model a sufficient condition for
interchange reconnection to overcome gravity to drive the wind is derived. The
combination of Alfv\'enic ejection and reconnection-driven heating yields a
minimum value of the Alfv\'en speed of the order of 350-400$km/s$ that is
required to drive the wind. Recent evidence based on Parker Solar Probe (PSP)
observations suggests that this threshold is typically exceeded in the coronal
holes that are the source regions of the fast wind. On the other hand, since
reconnection in the coronal environment is predicted to have a bursty
character, the magnitude of reconnection outflows can be highly variable. The
consequence is a highly non-uniform wind in which in some regions the velocity
increases sharply to super-Alfv\'enic values while in adjacent regions the
formation of an asymptotic wind fails. A simple model is constructed to
describe the turbulent mixing of these highly-sheared super-Alfv\'enic flows
that suggests these flows are the free-energy source of the Alfv\'enic
turbulence and associated switchbacks that have been documented in the PSP data
in the near coronal environment. The global wind profiles are presented and
benchmarked with Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations at 12 solar radii.

distinction between standard and robust models in the filters' weight

is an intrinsic property for DNNs, and thus a static network architecture is
difficult to improve the accuracy and robustness at the same time. Secondly,
based on this observation, we propose a sample-wise dynamic network
architecture named Adversarial Weight-Varied Network (AW-Net), which focuses on
dealing with clean and adversarial examples with a ``divide and rule"" weight
strategy. The AW-Net dynamically adjusts network's weights based on regulation
signals generated by an adversarial detector, which is directly influenced by
the input sample. Benefiting from the dynamic network architecture, clean and

provides the potentiality to enhance the accuracy and robustness
simultaneously. A series of experiments demonstrate that our AW-Net is
architecture-friendly to handle both clean and adversarial examples and can
achieve better trade-off performance than state-of-the-art robust models.

provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand inhabitants' behavior and
their interactions with the built environments. Among the widely used data
resources, mobile phone data is the one passively collected and has the largest
coverage in the population. However, mobile operators cannot pinpoint one user
within meters, leading to the difficulties in activity inference. To that end,
we propose a data analysis framework to identify user's activity via coupling
the mobile phone data with location-based social networks (LBSN) data. The two
datasets are integrated into a Bayesian inference module, considering people's
circadian rhythms in both time and space. Specifically, the framework considers
the pattern of arrival time to each type of facility and the spatial
distribution of facilities. The former can be observed from the LBSN Data and
the latter is provided by the points of interest (POIs) dataset. Taking
Shanghai as an example, we reconstruct the activity chains of 1,000,000 active
mobile phone users and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of each
activity type. We assess the results with some official surveys and a
real-world check-in dataset collected in Shanghai, indicating that the proposed
method can capture and analyze human activities effectively. Next, we cluster
users' inferred activity chains with a topic model to understand the behavior
of different groups of users. This data analysis framework provides an example
of reconstructing and understanding the activity of the population at an urban
scale with big data fusion.

by the Earth surface per unit time as a function of the solar ephemerids and
derives a model of climate changes at periods longer than a few thousand years
and more. In this paper, we investigate the potential connections of global
temperature and Earth rotation at much shorter periods, in the complementary
range of one to a few hundred years. For temperature, we select the HadCrut05.
For Earth rotation, defined by pole coordinates and length of day, we use the
IERS data sets. Using iterative Singular Spectrum Analysis (iSSA), we extract
the trend and quasi-periodic components of these time series. The first
quasi-periodic components (period ~80-90 years) are expressions of the
Gleissberg cycle and are identical (at the level of uncertainty of the data).
Taken together, the trend and Gleissberg components allow one to reconstruct
87% of the variance of the data for lod and 48% for temperature. The next four
iSSA components, with periods ~40, 22, 15 and 9 years. The Lagrange and Laplace
theories imply that the derivative of pole motion should be identical to lod
variations: this strong check is passed by the trend + Gleissberg
reconstructions. The annual oscillations of pole motion and lod are linked to
annual variations in Sun-Earth distance, in agreement with an astronomical, but
not a climatic origin. The results obtained in this paper for the observed
temperature/rotation couple add to the growing list of evidence of solar and
planetary forcings of gravitational nature on a number of geophysical processes
(including sea-level, sea-level pressure, sea-ice extent, oceanic climate
indices).

brings challenges to the model's adaptiveness. In this paper, we address this

adaptive representation. Towards this goal, MetaGait injects meta-knowledge,
which could guide the model to perceive sample-specific properties, into the
calibration network of the attention mechanism to improve the adaptiveness from
the omni-scale, omni-dimension, and omni-process perspectives. Specifically, we
leverage the meta-knowledge across the entire process, where Meta Triple
Attention and Meta Temporal Pooling are presented respectively to adaptively
capture omni-scale dependency from spatial/channel/temporal dimensions
simultaneously and to adaptively aggregate temporal information through
integrating the merits of three complementary temporal aggregation methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the
proposed MetaGait. On CASIA-B, we achieve rank-1 accuracy of 98.7%, 96.0%, and

novel allotropic transformation on the original graph, wherein the nodes and

Weisfeiler-Leman tests, and therefore, the additional inductivity to unseen

demonstrated over four real-world graphs, GRAFENNE empowers the underlying GNN

projective class groups $K_0(\mathcal{H}(U))$ where U varies over the compact

massive quark will disappear, if the electroweak symmetry of the Standard Model
(SM) is restored at a high energy scale. This disappearance is taken as the
high-energy input for the dispersion relation, which must be obeyed by the
width difference between two meson mass eigenstates. The solution to the
dispersion relation at low energy, i.e., in the symmetry broken phase, then
connects the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements to the quark
masses involved in the box diagrams responsible for meson mixing. It is
demonstrated via the analysis of the $D$ meson mixing that the typical $d$, $s$
and $b$ quark masses demand the CKM matrix elements in agreement with measured
values. In particular, the known numerical relation $V_{us}\approx
\sqrt{m_s/m_b}$ with the $s$ ($b$) quark mass $m_s$ ($m_b$) can be derived
analytically from our solution. Next we apply the same formalism to the mixing
of the $\mu^- e^+$ and $\mu^+ e^-$ states through similar box diagrams with
intermediate neutrino channels. It is shown that the neutrino masses in the
normal hierarchy (NH), instead of in the inverted hierarchy or quasi-degenerate
spectrum, match the observed Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata matrix elements.
The lepton mixing angles larger than the quark ones are explained by means of
the inequality $m_2^2/m_3^2\gg m_s^2/m_b^2$, $m_{2,3}$ being the neutrino
masses in the NH. At last, the solution for the $\tau^-e^+$-$\tau^+e^-$ mixing
specifies the mixing angle $\theta_{23}\approx 45^\circ$ with slight preference
for the first octant. Our work suggests that the fermion masses and mixing
parameters are constrained dynamically, and the neutrino mass orderings can be
discriminated by the internal consistency of the SM.

that the Gaussian noise is not the adequate noise model in this setting, we
propose to generalize PnP using theBregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) method. BPG
replaces the Euclidean distance with a Bregman divergence that can better
capture the smoothness properties of the problem. We introduce the Bregman

  The proposed method is based on a flexible direct model of the high-contrast

instrumental response and for the contributions of both the star and the
companion. The contributions of these two components and the calibration
parameters are jointly estimated by solving a regularized inverse problem. This

injecting synthetic companion signals in these data. The proposed

self-subtraction bias, even for companions observed very close to the
coronagraphic mask. Careful modeling and calibration of the angular and
spectral dispersion laws of the instrument clearly reduce the contamination by
the stellar leakages. In practice, the outputs of the method are mostly driven

an analytical understanding of how the entanglement degree in data affects

impact of entangled data on prediction error exhibits a dual effect, depending
on the number of permitted measurements. With a sufficient number of
measurements, increasing the entanglement of training data consistently reduces
the prediction error or decreases the required size of the training data to

Driven by end-to-end deep learning, recent studies suggest vision and language
processing are effective for scene text recognition. Yet, solving edit errors
such as add, delete, or replace is still the main challenge for existing
approaches. In fact, the content of the text and its audio are naturally
corresponding to each other, i.e., a single character error may result in a
clear different pronunciation. In this paper, we propose the AudioOCR, a simple
yet effective probabilistic audio decoder for mel spectrogram sequence
prediction to guide the scene text recognition, which only participates in the
training phase and brings no extra cost during the inference stage. The
underlying principle of AudioOCR can be easily applied to the existing
approaches. Experiments using 7 previous scene text recognition methods on 12
existing regular, irregular, and occluded benchmarks demonstrate our proposed
method can bring consistent improvement. More importantly, through our
experimentation, we show that AudioOCR possesses a generalizability that
extends to more challenging scenarios, including recognizing non-English text,
out-of-vocabulary words, and text with various accents. Code will be available

manipulation tasks. However, teaching a robot to grasp objects with an
anthropomorphic hand is an arduous problem due to the high dimensionality of
state and action spaces. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers techniques to
design control policies for this kind of problems without explicit environment
or hand modeling. However, training these policies with state-of-the-art
model-free algorithms is greatly challenging for multi-fingered hands. The main
problem is that an efficient exploration of the environment is not possible for
such high-dimensional problems, thus causing issues in the initial phases of
policy optimization. One possibility to address this is to rely on off-line
task demonstrations. However, oftentimes this is incredibly demanding in terms
of time and computational resources. In this work, we overcome these
requirements and propose the A Grasp Pose is All You Need (G-PAYN) method for
the anthropomorphic hand of the iCub humanoid. We develop an approach to
automatically collect task demonstrations to initialize the training of the
policy. The proposed grasping pipeline starts from a grasp pose generated by an
external algorithm, used to initiate the movement. Then a control policy
(previously trained with the proposed G-PAYN) is used to reach and grab the
object. We deployed the iCub into the MuJoCo simulator and use it to test our
approach with objects from the YCB-Video dataset. The results show that G-PAYN
outperforms current DRL techniques in the considered setting, in terms of
success rate and execution time with respect to the baselines. The code to

and combustion engines are prone to dynamical transitions from one state to
another, with catastrophic consequences. State variables of such systems often
exhibit aperiodic fluctuations, either chaotic or stochastic in nature. Often,
the parameters describing a system vary with time, showing time dependency.
Constrained by these effects, it becomes difficult to be warned of an impending
critical transition, as such effects contaminate the precursory signals of the
transition. Therefore, a need for efficient and reliable early-warning signals
(EWS) in such complex systems is in pressing demand. Motivated by this fact, in
the present work, we analyze various EWS in the context of a non-autonomous
turbulent thermoacoustic system. In particular, we investigate the efficacy of
different EWS in forecasting the onset of thermoacoustic instability (TAI) and
their reliability with respect to the rate of change of the control parameter.
We consider the Reynolds number (Re) as the control parameter, which is varied
linearly with time at finite rates. The considered EWS are derived from
critical slowing down, spectral properties, and fractal characteristics of the
system variables. The state of TAI is associated with large amplitude acoustic
pressure oscillations that could lead thermoacoustic systems to break down. Our
analysis shows that irrespective of the rate of variation of the control
parameter, the Hurst exponent and variance of autocorrelation coefficients warn
of an impending transition well in advance and are more reliable than other EWS
measures. We also investigate the variation of amplitudes of the most
significant modes of acoustic pressure oscillations with the Hurst exponent.
Such variations lead to scaling laws which could be significant in prediction
and devising control actions to mitigate TAI.

promising platform for quantum information processing. In DPQA, atomic qubits
are selectively loaded into arrays of optical traps that can be reconfigured
during the computation itself. Leveraging qubit transport and parallel,
entangling quantum operations, different pairs of qubits, even those initially
far away, can be entangled at different stages of the quantum program
execution. Such reconfigurability and non-local connectivity present new
challenges for compilation, especially in the layout synthesis step which
places and routes the qubits and schedules the gates. In this paper, we
consider a DPQA architecture that contains multiple arrays and supports 2D
array movements, representing cutting-edge experimental platforms. Within this
architecture, we discretize the state space and formulate layout synthesis as a
satisfactory modulo theories problem, which can be solved by existing solvers
optimally in terms of circuit depth. For a set of benchmark circuits generated
by random graphs with complex connectivities, our compiler OLSQ-DPQA reduces
the number of two-qubit entangling gates on small problem instances by 1.7x
compared to optimal compilation results on a fixed planar architecture. To
further improve scalability and practicality of the method, we introduce a
greedy heuristic inspired by the iterative peeling approach in classical
integrated circuit routing. Using a hybrid approach that combined the greedy
and optimal methods, we demonstrate that our DPQA-based compiled circuits
feature reduced scaling overhead compared to a grid fixed architecture,
resulting in 5.1X less two-qubit gates for 90 qubit quantum circuits. These
methods enable programmable, complex quantum circuits with neutral atom quantum

forms of correlated (pseudo)randomness, using minimal interactions followed
solely by local computations, yielding silent secure two-party computation
protocols (protocols where the preprocessing phase requires almost no

this to build N-party protocols. However, known constructions for programmable
PCG's can only produce OLE's over large fields, and use rather new splittable
Ring-LPN assumption.
  In this work, we overcome both limitations. To this end, we introduce the
quasi-abelian syndrome decoding problem (QA-SD), a family of assumptions which
generalises the well-established quasi-cyclic syndrome decoding assumption.
Building upon QA-SD, we construct new programmable PCG's for OLE's over any

during training and the detector needs to discover anomalies on-the-fly. The
recently proposed deep-learning-based approaches could somehow alleviate the
problem but there is still a long way to go in obtaining an industrial-class
anomaly detector for real-world applications. On the other hand, in some
particular AD tasks, a few anomalous samples are labeled manually for achieving
higher accuracy. However, this performance gain is at the cost of considerable
annotation efforts, which can be intractable in many practical scenarios.
  In this work, the above two problems are addressed in a unified framework.
Firstly, inspired by the success of the patch-matching-based AD algorithms, we
train a sliding vision transformer over the residuals generated by a novel
position-constrained patch-matching. Secondly, the conventional pixel-wise
segmentation problem is cast into a block-wise classification problem. Thus the
sliding transformer can attain even higher accuracy with much less annotation
labor. Thirdly, to further reduce the labeling cost, we propose to label the
anomalous regions using only bounding boxes. The unlabeled regions caused by
the weak labels are effectively exploited using a highly-customized
semi-supervised learning scheme equipped with two novel data augmentation
methods. The proposed method outperforms all the state-of-the-art approaches
using all the evaluation metrics in both the unsupervised and supervised
scenarios. On the popular MVTec-AD dataset, our SemiREST algorithm obtains the
Average Precision (AP) of 81.2% in the unsupervised condition and 84.4% AP for
supervised anomaly detection. Surprisingly, with the bounding-box-based
semi-supervisions, SemiREST still outperforms the SOTA methods with full

A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation
of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and

existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT

applies a subgraph network generation strategy to produce augmented views. This
strategy converts the original graph into an Edge-to-Node mapping network with
both topological and attribute features. The single-shot augmented view is a
first-order subgraph network that mines the interaction between nodes,
node-edge, and edges. In addition, we also investigate the impact of the
second-order subgraph augmentation on mining graph structure interactions, and
further, propose a contrastive objective that fuses the first-order and
second-order subgraph information. We compare SGNCL with classical and
state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning methods on multiple benchmark
datasets of different domains. Extensive experiments show that SGNCL achieves
competitive or better performance (top three) on all datasets in unsupervised

  Bias",,,,,"eess.AS cs.AI cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scaling text-to-speech to a large and wild dataset has been proven to be
highly effective in achieving timbre and speech style generalization,
particularly in zero-shot TTS. However, previous works usually encode speech
into latent using audio codec and use autoregressive language models or
diffusion models to generate it, which ignores the intrinsic nature of speech
and may lead to inferior or uncontrollable results. We argue that speech can be
decomposed into several attributes (e.g., content, timbre, prosody, and phase)
and each of them should be modeled using a module with appropriate inductive
biases. From this perspective, we carefully design a novel and large zero-shot
TTS system called Mega-TTS, which is trained with large-scale wild data and
models different attributes in different ways: 1) Instead of using latent
encoded by audio codec as the intermediate feature, we still choose spectrogram
as it separates the phase and other attributes very well. Phase can be
appropriately constructed by the GAN-based vocoder and does not need to be
modeled by the language model. 2) We model the timbre using global vectors
since timbre is a global attribute that changes slowly over time. 3) We further
use a VQGAN-based acoustic model to generate the spectrogram and a latent code
language model to fit the distribution of prosody, since prosody changes
quickly over time in a sentence, and language models can capture both local and
long-range dependencies. We scale Mega-TTS to multi-domain datasets with 20K
hours of speech and evaluate its performance on unseen speakers. Experimental
results demonstrate that Mega-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art TTS systems on
zero-shot TTS, speech editing, and cross-lingual TTS tasks, with superior
naturalness, robustness, and speaker similarity due to the proper inductive
bias of each module. Audio samples are available at

enhancing the autonomy of computer-aided diagnosis and intervention systems.
Medical data collection normally involves different scanners, protocols, and
populations, making domain adaptation (DA) a highly demanding research field to
alleviate model degradation in the deployment site. To preserve the model
performance across multiple testing domains, this work proposes the
Curriculum-based Augmented Fourier Domain Adaptation (Curri-AFDA) for robust
medical image segmentation. In particular, our curriculum learning strategy is
based on the causal relationship of a model under different levels of data
shift in the deployment phase, where the higher the shift is, the harder to
recognize the variance. Considering this, we progressively introduce more
amplitude information from the target domain to the source domain in the
frequency space during the curriculum-style training to smoothly schedule the
semantic knowledge transfer in an easier-to-harder manner. Besides, we
incorporate the training-time chained augmentation mixing to help expand the
data distributions while preserving the domain-invariant semantics, which is
beneficial for the acquired model to be more robust and generalize better to
unseen domains. Extensive experiments on two segmentation tasks of Retina and
Nuclei collected from multiple sites and scanners suggest that our proposed
method yields superior adaptation and generalization performance. Meanwhile,
our approach proves to be more robust under various corruption types and
increasing severity levels. In addition, we show our method is also beneficial
in the domain-adaptive classification task with skin lesion datasets. The code

requires that the ancestral line occupy the top position in the graph just
`before' the event (in forward time). Relative to the neutral case (that is,
without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the beneficial type, an
increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a decrease in the deleterious
mutation rate. This sheds new light on previous analytical results. We discuss
our findings in the light of a well-known observation at the interface of

descent (SGD), have close parallels to natural processes that navigate a
high-dimensional parameter space -- for example protein folding or evolution.
Our study uses a Fokker-Planck approach, adapted from statistical physics, to
explore these parallels in a single, unified framework. We focus in particular
on the stationary state of the system in the long-time limit, which in
conventional SGD is out of equilibrium, exhibiting persistent currents in the
space of network parameters. As in its physical analogues, the current is
associated with an entropy production rate for any given training trajectory.
The stationary distribution of these rates obeys the integral and detailed
fluctuation theorems -- nonequilibrium generalizations of the second law of
thermodynamics. We validate these relations in two numerical examples, a
nonlinear regression network and MNIST digit classification. While the
fluctuation theorems are universal, there are other aspects of the stationary
state that are highly sensitive to the training details. Surprisingly, the
effective loss landscape and diffusion matrix that determine the shape of the
stationary distribution vary depending on the simple choice of minibatching
done with or without replacement. We can take advantage of this nonequilibrium
sensitivity to engineer an equilibrium stationary state for a particular
application: sampling from a posterior distribution of network weights in
Bayesian machine learning. We propose a new variation of stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics (SGLD) that harnesses without replacement minibatching. In an
example system where the posterior is exactly known, this SGWORLD algorithm
outperforms SGLD, converging to the posterior orders of magnitude faster as a
function of the learning rate.

  Out-of-Distribution Detection",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key feature of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is to exploit a trained
neural network by extracting statistical patterns and relationships through the
multi-layer classifier to detect shifts in the expected input data
distribution. Despite achieving solid results, several state-of-the-art methods
rely on the penultimate or last layer outputs only, leaving behind valuable
information for OOD detection. Methods that explore the multiple layers either
require a special architecture or a supervised objective to do so. This work
adopts an original approach based on a functional view of the network that
exploits the sample's trajectories through the various layers and their
statistical dependencies. It goes beyond multivariate features aggregation and
introduces a baseline rooted in functional anomaly detection. In this new
framework, OOD detection translates into detecting samples whose trajectories
differ from the typical behavior characterized by the training set. We validate
our method and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in OOD detection
compared to strong state-of-the-art baselines on computer vision benchmarks.

selected by the model itself, their distribution differs from the inference
distribution and thus exhibits sample selection bias (SSB) that affects model
performance. Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting
techniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration. Another
line of work relies on costly uniform data that is inadequate to train
industrial models. Thus mitigating SSB in industrial models with a
uniform-data-free framework is worth exploring. Fortunately, many platforms
display mixed results of organic items (i.e., recommendations) and sponsored
items (i.e., ads) to users, where impressions of ads and recommendations are
selected by different systems but share the same user decision rationales.
Based on the above characteristics, we propose to leverage recommendations

elaborating data augmentation, Rec4Ad learns disentangled representations with

process that follows a power law with periodic boundary conditions on the

extend well below $1/T_\mathrm{span}$, and many pulsars are known to exhibit
quasi-periodic timing noise. In this paper we investigate several adaptions
that try to account for these differences between the observed behaviour and
the simple power-law model. Firstly, we propose to include an additional term
that models the quasi-periodic spin-down variations known to be present in many
pulsars. Secondly, we show that a Fourier basis of $1/2T_\mathrm{span}$ can be
more suited for estimating long term timing parameters such as the spin
frequency second derivative (F2), and is required when the exponent of the
power spectrum is greater than ~4. We also implement a Bayesian version of the
generalised least squares `Cholesky' method which has different limitations at
low frequency, but find that there is little advantage over Fourier-basis
methods. We apply our quasi-periodic spin down model to a sample of pulsars
with known spin-down variations and show that this improves parameter
estimation of F2 and proper motion for the most pathological cases, but in
general the results are consistent with a power-law model. The models are all

BackpropTools to be used seamlessly on a heterogeneous set of platforms, from

algorithms with simulation environments, BackpropTools can solve popular RL
problems like the Pendulum-v1 swing-up about 7 to 15 times faster in terms of
wall-clock training time compared to other popular RL frameworks when using

importantly, isolated data. In parts, federated learning lifts this assumption,
as it sets out to solve the real-world challenge of collaboratively learning a
shared model from data distributed across clients. However, motivated primarily
by privacy and computational constraints, the fact that data may change,
distributions drift, or even tasks advance individually on clients, is seldom
taken into account. The field of continual learning addresses this separate
challenge and first steps have recently been taken to leverage synergies in
distributed supervised settings, in which several clients learn to solve
changing classification tasks over time without forgetting previously seen
ones. Motivated by these prior works, we posit that such federated continual
learning should be grounded in unsupervised learning of representations that
are shared across clients; in the loose spirit of how humans can indirectly
leverage others' experience without exposure to a specific task. For this
purpose, we demonstrate that masked autoencoders for distribution estimation
are particularly amenable to this setup. Specifically, their masking strategy
can be seamlessly integrated with task attention mechanisms to enable selective
knowledge transfer between clients. We empirically corroborate the latter
statement through several continual federated scenarios on both image and
binary datasets.

cloud storage services. It comes with the vulnerability of being accessed by
third parties. Security is one of the major hurdles in the cloud server for the
user when the user data that reside in local storage is outsourced to the
cloud. It has given rise to security concerns involved in data confidentiality
even after the deletion of data from cloud storage. Though, it raises a serious
problem when the encrypted data needs to be shared with more people than the
data owner initially designated. However, searching on encrypted data is a
fundamental issue in cloud storage. The method of searching over encrypted data
represents a significant challenge in the cloud.
  Searchable encryption allows a cloud server to conduct a search over
encrypted data on behalf of the data users without learning the underlying
plaintexts. While many academic SE schemes show provable security, they usually
expose some query information, making them less practical, weak in usability,
and challenging to deploy. Also, sharing encrypted data with other authorized
users must provide each document's secret key. However, this way has many
limitations due to the difficulty of key management and distribution.
  We have designed the system using the existing cryptographic approaches,
ensuring the search on encrypted data over the cloud. The primary focus of our
proposed model is to ensure user privacy and security through a less
computationally intensive, user-friendly system with a trusted third party
entity. To demonstrate our proposed model, we have implemented a web
application called CryptoSearch as an overlay system on top of a well-known
cloud storage domain. It exhibits secure search on encrypted data with no

nature complicates the understanding of their prediction process. In this
context, recent advances in the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) have proposed the extraction and localization of concepts, or which
visual cues intervene on the prediction process of CNNs. This paper tackles the
application of concept extraction (CE) methods to industry 4.0 scenarios. To
this end, we modify a recently developed technique, ``Extracting Concepts with
Local Aggregated Descriptors'' (ECLAD), improving its scalability.
Specifically, we propose a novel procedure for calculating concept importance,
utilizing a wrapper function designed for CNNs. This process is aimed at
decreasing the number of times each image needs to be evaluated. Subsequently,
we demonstrate the potential of CE methods, by applying them in three
industrial use cases. We selected three representative use cases in the context
of quality control for material design (tailored textiles), manufacturing
(carbon fiber reinforcement), and maintenance (photovoltaic module inspection).
In these examples, CE was able to successfully extract and locate concepts
directly related to each task. This is, the visual cues related to each
concept, coincided with what human experts would use to perform the task
themselves, even when the visual cues were entangled between multiple classes.
Through empirical results, we show that CE can be applied for understanding
CNNs in an industrial context, giving useful insights that can relate to domain

trained on data with dynamics shift, i.e., with different underlying
environment dynamics. A majority of current methods address such issue by
training context encoders to identify environment parameters. Data with
dynamics shift are separated according to their environment parameters to train
the corresponding policy. However, these methods can be sample inefficient as
data are used \textit{ad hoc}, and policies trained for one dynamics cannot
benefit from data collected in all other environments with different dynamics.
In this paper, we find that in many environments with similar structures and
different dynamics, optimal policies have similar stationary state
distributions. We exploit such property and learn the stationary state
distribution from data with dynamics shift for efficient data reuse. Such
distribution is used to regularize the policy trained in a new environment,
leading to the SRPO (\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{O}ptimization) algorithm. To conduct theoretical analyses, the
intuition of similar environment structures is characterized by the notion of
homomorphous MDPs. We then demonstrate a lower-bound performance guarantee on
policies regularized by the stationary state distribution. In practice, SRPO
can be an add-on module to context-based algorithms in both online and offline
RL settings. Experimental results show that SRPO can make several context-based
algorithms far more data efficient and significantly improve their overall
performance.

  Sliding",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  By interlayer sliding in van der Waals (vdW) materials, the switching
electric polarization of ultrathin ferroelectric materials leads to the widely
studied slidetronics. In this work, we report that such sliding can further
tailor anharmonic effects and hence thermal transport properties due to the
changed intrinsic coupling between atomic layers. And we propose an
unprecedented concept dubbed as slidephononics, where the phonons and
associated physical properties can be controlled by varying the intrinsic
stacking configurations of slidetronic vdW materials. Based on the
state-of-the-art first-principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the
thermal conductivity of boron nitride (BN) bilayers can be significantly
modulated (by up to four times) along the sliding pathways. Detailed analysis
reveals that the variation of thermal conductivities can be attributed to the
tunable (de-)coupling of the out-of-plane acoustic phonon branches with the
other phonon modes, which is induced by the interlayer charge transfer. Such
strongly modulated thermal conductivity via interlayer sliding in vdW materials
paves the way to engineer thermal management materials in emerging vdW
electronic devices, which would shed light on future studies of slidephononics.

technique based on the Fourier-Hermite transform of the particle distribution

energy spread, highly conditioned by collisions, which involves velocity scales
more quickly than the spatial scales, even when nonlinear effects are dominant.

more disparate groups are present in the network, so that the groups are highly
connected internally, but loosely connected to each other. In many cases it is
of interest to increase the connectivity of disparate groups so as to, e.g.,
minimize social friction, or expose individuals to diverse viewpoints. A
commonly-used mechanism for increasing the network connectivity is to add edge
shortcuts between pairs of nodes. In many applications of interest, edge
shortcuts typically translate to recommendations, e.g., what video to watch, or
what news article to read next. The problem of reducing structural bias or
segregation via edge shortcuts has recently been studied in the literature, and
random walks have been an essential tool for modeling navigation and
connectivity in the underlying networks. Existing methods, however, either do
not offer approximation guarantees, or engineer the objective so that it
satisfies certain desirable properties that simplify the optimization~task. In
this paper we address the problem of adding a given number of shortcut edges in
the network so as to directly minimize the average hitting time and the maximum
hitting time between two disparate groups. Our algorithm for minimizing average
hitting time is a greedy bicriteria that relies on supermodularity. In
contrast, maximum hitting time is not supermodular. Despite, we develop an
approximation algorithm for that objective as well, by leveraging connections
with average hitting time and the asymmetric k-center problem.

in [E. McDonald, J. Pestana, and A. Wathen. SIAM J. Sci. Comput.,
40(2):A1012-A1033, 2018], we propose an absolute value version of the block

Hermitian positive definite variant of the block $\alpha$-circulant

matrix-vector multiplication of the preconditioner can be fast implemented via

convergence rate independent of the matrix size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first attempt to generalize the original absolute value block

However, evaluating whether or not these approximations can be trusted remains
a challenge. Most approaches evaluate the posterior estimator only in
expectation over the observation space. This limits their interpretability and
is not sufficient to identify for which observations the approximation can be
trusted or should be improved. Building upon the well-known classifier
two-sample test (C2ST), we introduce L-C2ST, a new method that allows for a
local evaluation of the posterior estimator at any given observation. It offers
theoretically grounded and easy to interpret - e.g. graphical - diagnostics,
and unlike C2ST, does not require access to samples from the true posterior. In
the case of normalizing flow-based posterior estimators, L-C2ST can be
specialized to offer better statistical power, while being computationally more
efficient. On standard SBI benchmarks, L-C2ST provides comparable results to
C2ST and outperforms alternative local approaches such as coverage tests based
on highest predictive density (HPD). We further highlight the importance of
local evaluation and the benefit of interpretability of L-C2ST on a challenging

to optimally size solar photovoltaic and lithium battery storage systems,
reducing Oxford's grid electricity reliance in buildings. The analysis starts
with modeling the electricity demand. The model uses Elexon electricity
settlement profiles, and assembles them into the demand profile according to
the quantity and types of buildings in Oxford. Then, solar generation is
modeled using Pfenninger and Staffell's method. Solar photovoltaic and lithium
storage systems are sized using a hybridized analytical and iterative method.
First, the method calculates the solar system size search range, then iterates
through the range. At each solar size, the method calculates and iterates
through the storage system size search range. Within each iteration, the
renewable system is simulated using demand and generation data with a
simplified system set-up and the conventional operation strategy. The method
outputs combinations of solar system capacity, storage system capacity, and
grid electricity import. Each combination's levelized cost of electricity is
calculated, and the lowest cost combination is the optimal sizing. Solar and
storage system costs are projected from 2019 to 2100, and the optimal sizing is
calculated for each year. The result shows that solar photovoltaic is
economically competitive, but lithium storage cost is still too high. As solar
and storage prices continue to drop, they will take up greater portions of the
energy system. However, there will always be a need for the grid, as it
provides flexibility and can meet demands that are too costly for solar and

dichotomy is between Everettian fission (splitting) and Saunders-Wallace-Wilson
divergence. For fission, an observer may have multiple futures, whereas for
divergence they always have a single future. Divergence was explicitly
introduced to resolve the problem of pre-measurement uncertainty for Everettian
theory, which is universally believed to be absent for fission. Here, I
maintain that there is indeed uncertainty about future observations prior to
fission, so long as objective probability is a property of Everettian branches.
This is made possible if the universe is a set and branches are subsets with
probability measure. A universe which is a set of universes which are
macroscopically isomorphic and span all possible configurations of microscopic
local be\""ables fulfils that role. If objective probability is a property of
branches, a successful Deutsch-Wallace decision-theoretic argument would
justify the Principal Principle and be part of probability theory rather than
being specific to Many Worlds. Any macroscopic object in our environment
becomes a set of isomorphs with different microscopic configurations, each in
an elemental universe (elemental in the set-theoretic sense). This is similar
to Many Interacting Worlds theory but the observer inhabits the set of worlds,
not an individual world. An observer has many elemental bodies.

  review. An earlier version has been accepted by CVPR 2022 (arXiv:2203.10856)",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The raw depth image captured by indoor depth sensors usually has an extensive
range of missing depth values due to inherent limitations such as the inability
to perceive transparent objects and the limited distance range. The incomplete
depth map with missing values burdens many downstream vision tasks, and a
rising number of depth completion methods have been proposed to alleviate this
issue. While most existing methods can generate accurate dense depth maps from
sparse and uniformly sampled depth maps, they are not suitable for
complementing large contiguous regions of missing depth values, which is common
and critical in images captured in indoor environments. To overcome these
challenges, we design a novel two-branch end-to-end fusion network named
RDFC-GAN, which takes a pair of RGB and incomplete depth images as input to
predict a dense and completed depth map. The first branch employs an
encoder-decoder structure, by adhering to the Manhattan world assumption and
utilizing normal maps from RGB-D information as guidance, to regress the local
dense depth values from the raw depth map. In the other branch, we propose an
RGB-depth fusion CycleGAN to transfer the RGB image to the fine-grained
textured depth map. We adopt adaptive fusion modules named W-AdaIN to propagate
the features across the two branches, and we append a confidence fusion head to
fuse the two outputs of the branches for the final depth map. Extensive
experiments on NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D demonstrate that our proposed method
clearly improves the depth completion performance, especially in a more
realistic setting of indoor environments, with the help of our proposed pseudo
depth maps in training.

quasi-stationary distributions (QSDs), with a Yaglom limit given by the unique
QSD minimising the survival probability. On the other hand, for fixed
$N<\infty$, this particle system converges to a unique stationary distribution
as time $t\rightarrow\infty$. We prove the following selection principle: the
empirical measure of the $N$-particle stationary distribution converges to the
aforedescribed Yaglom limit as $N\rightarrow\infty$. The selection problem for
this particular Fleming-Viot process is closely connected to the microscopic

stages, whereby they first learn to categorize phonemes before they develop
their lexicon and eventually master increasingly complex syntactic structures.
However, the computational principles that lead to this learning trajectory
remain largely unknown. To investigate this, we here compare the learning
trajectories of deep language models to those of children. Specifically, we
test whether, during its training, GPT-2 exhibits stages of language
acquisition comparable to those observed in children aged between 18 months and
6 years. For this, we train 48 GPT-2 models from scratch and evaluate their
syntactic and semantic abilities at each training step, using 96 probes curated
from the BLiMP, Zorro and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We then compare these
evaluations with the behavior of 54 children during language production. Our
analyses reveal three main findings. First, similarly to children, the language
models tend to learn linguistic skills in a systematic order. Second, this
learning scheme is parallel: the language tasks that are learned last improve
from the very first training steps. Third, some - but not all - learning stages
are shared between children and these language models. Overall, these results
shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlight
important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process
natural language.

learning on graph-structured data. The most popular class of GNNs operate by

Neural Networks (MPNNs). Given their widespread use, understanding the
expressive power of MPNNs is a key question. However, existing results
typically consider settings with uninformative node features. In this paper, we
provide a rigorous analysis to determine which function classes of node
features can be learned by an MPNN of a given capacity. We do so by measuring
the level of pairwise interactions between nodes that MPNNs allow for. This
measure provides a novel quantitative characterization of the so-called
over-squashing effect, which is observed to occur when a large volume of
messages is aggregated into fixed-size vectors. Using our measure, we prove
that, to guarantee sufficient communication between pairs of nodes, the

over-squashing hinders the expressive power of MPNNs. We validate our

reduce the model performance, or targeted, so-called backdoors, which add
adversarial behavior that can be triggered with appropriately crafted inputs.
Striving for stealthiness, backdoor attacks are harder to deal with.
  Mitigation techniques against poisoning attacks rely on monitoring certain
metrics and filtering malicious model updates. However, previous works didn't
consider real-world adversaries and data distributions. To support our
statement, we define a new notion of strong adaptive adversaries that can
simultaneously adapt to multiple objectives and demonstrate through extensive
tests, that existing defense methods can be circumvented in this adversary
model. We also demonstrate, that existing defenses have limited effectiveness
when no assumptions are made about underlying data distributions.
  To address realistic scenarios and adversary models, we propose
Metric-Cascades (MESAS) a new defense that leverages multiple detection metrics
simultaneously for the filtering of poisoned model updates. This approach
forces adaptive attackers into a heavy multi-objective optimization problem,
and our evaluation with nine backdoors and three datasets shows that even our
strong adaptive attacker cannot evade MESAS's detection. We show that MESAS
outperforms existing defenses in distinguishing backdoors from distortions

Overall, MESAS is the first defense that is robust against strong adaptive

significant amount of storage space that can only be deployed on remote cloud
server nodes. Additionally, using commercial LLMs can be costly since they may
charge based on usage frequency. In this paper, we explore how to enable
intelligent cost-effective interactions between the agent and an LLM. We
propose a reinforcement learning based mediator model that determines when it
is necessary to consult LLMs for high-level instructions to accomplish a target
task. Experiments on 4 MiniGrid environments that entail planning sub-goals
demonstrate that our method can learn to solve target tasks with only a few
necessary interactions with an LLM, significantly reducing interaction costs in
testing environments, compared with baseline methods. Experimental results also
suggest that by learning a mediator model to interact with the LLM, the agent's
performance becomes more robust against partial observability of the
environment. Our Code is available at https://github.com/ZJLAB-AMMI/LLM4RL.

which are set systems that generalize matroids, with important connections to
matching theory and graph embeddings. Furthermore, our proof uses a new
approach of sieving polynomial families, which generalizes the linear algebra
approach of the representative sets lemma to a setting of bounded-degree
polynomials. The representative sets statements for linear delta-matroids then
follow by analyzing the Pfaffian of the skew-symmetric matrix representing the
delta-matroid. Applying the same framework to the determinant instead of the
Pfaffian recovers the representative sets lemma for linear matroids.
Altogether, this significantly extends the toolbox available for kernelization.
  As an application, we show an exact sparsification result for Mader networks:
Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph and $\mathcal{T}$ a partition of a set of terminals $T
\subseteq V(G)$, $|T|=k$. A $\mathcal{T}$-path in $G$ is a path with endpoints
in distinct parts of $\mathcal{T}$ and internal vertices disjoint from $T$. In
polynomial time, we can derive a graph $G'=(V',E')$ with $T \subseteq V(G')$,
such that for every subset $S \subseteq T$ there is a packing of
$\mathcal{T}$-paths with endpoints $S$ in $G$ if and only if there is one in
$G'$, and $|V(G')|=O(k^3)$. This generalizes the (undirected version of the)
cut-covering lemma, which corresponds to the case that $\mathcal{T}$ contains
only two blocks.
  To prove the Mader network sparsification result, we furthermore define the
class of Mader delta-matroids, and show that they have linear representations.

also supporting entities with missing attributes. We additionally propose an
efficient pretraining strategy for reducing the required training runtime. We
train models using a biomedical KG containing approximately 2 million triples,

link prediction, and drug-protein interaction prediction, comparing against
methods that do not take attribute data into account. In the standard link

query-adaptive weights for each bit can better retrieve query-related items.
However, search using WHD is slower than that using HD. One main challenge is
that the complexity of extending a monotone increasing sequence using WHD to

the square of the sequence length, while that using HD is proportional to the

computational complexity and the total complexity is proportional to the
sequence length, which is justified by theoretical analysis. Experimental
results show that our method is faster than other WHD-based search methods.
Also, compared with the HD-based non-exhaustive search method, our method has

efficacy in aligning rewards with human intentions. However, a significant
challenge lies in the need of substantial human labels, which is costly and
time-consuming. Additionally, the expensive preference data obtained from prior
tasks is not typically reusable for subsequent task learning, leading to
extensive labeling for each new task. In this paper, we propose a novel
zero-shot preference-based RL algorithm that leverages labeled preference data
from source tasks to infer labels for target tasks, eliminating the requirement
for human queries. Our approach utilizes Gromov-Wasserstein distance to align
trajectory distributions between source and target tasks. The solved optimal
transport matrix serves as a correspondence between trajectories of two tasks,
making it possible to identify corresponding trajectory pairs between tasks and
transfer the preference labels. However, learning directly from inferred labels
that contains a fraction of noisy labels will result in an inaccurate reward
function, subsequently affecting policy performance. To this end, we introduce
Robust Preference Transformer, which models the rewards as Gaussian
distributions and incorporates reward uncertainty in addition to reward mean.
The empirical results on robotic manipulation tasks of Meta-World and Robomimic

FaaSwap leverages model swapping to support fast inference execution at low

keep-alive cost and enabling efficient GPU sharing across much more functions.
FaaSwap also supports swapping models between GPUs for load balancing and

mainly due to the non-differentiability of the spike activation, which prevents
the use of classical backpropagation. This is because state-of-the-art spiking
neural networks are usually derived from biologically-inspired neuron models,
to which are applied machine learning methods for training. Nowadays, research
about spiking neural networks focuses on the design of training algorithms
whose goal is to obtain networks that compete with their non-spiking version on
specific tasks. In this paper, we attempt the symmetrical approach: we modify
the dynamics of a well-known, easily trainable type of recurrent neural network
to make it event-based. This new RNN cell, called the Spiking Recurrent Cell,
therefore communicates using events, i.e. spikes, while being completely
differentiable. Vanilla backpropagation can thus be used to train any network
made of such RNN cell. We show that this new network can achieve performance
comparable to other types of spiking networks in the MNIST benchmark and its
variants, the Fashion-MNIST and the Neuromorphic-MNIST. Moreover, we show that
this new cell makes the training of deep spiking networks achievable.

  Graph Collaborative Filtering",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collaborative filtering (CF) is an important research direction in
recommender systems that aims to make recommendations given the information on

recent years due to its effectiveness in leveraging high-order information in
the user-item bipartite graph for better recommendations. Specifically, recent
studies show the success of graph neural networks (GNN) for CF is attributed to
its low-pass filtering effects. However, current researches lack a study of how
different signal components contributes to recommendations, and how to design
strategies to properly use them well. To this end, from the view of spectral
transformation, we analyze the important factors that a graph filter should
consider to achieve better performance. Based on the discoveries, we design
JGCF, an efficient and effective method for CF based on Jacobi polynomial bases
and frequency decomposition strategies. Extensive experiments on four widely
used public datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed
methods, which brings at most 27.06% performance gain on Alibaba-iFashion.
Besides, the experimental results also show that JGCF is better at handling
sparse datasets, which shows potential in making recommendations for cold-start

successful platform to explore quantum impurity problems. A single impurity
immersed in a Fermi gas leads to the formation of a polaron, a quasiparticle
consisting of the impurity being dressed by the surrounding medium. With a
radius of about the Fermi wavelength, the density profile of a polaron cannot
be explored using in-situ optical imaging techniques. In this work, we propose
a new experimental measurement technique that enables the in-situ imaging of
the polaron cloud in ultracold quantum gases. The impurity atom is first
excited to an interacting state which induces the formation of a polaron cloud.
This is followed by the excitation of the impurity atom to a Rydberg state. Due
to the mesoscopic interaction range of Rydberg excitations, which can be tuned
by the principal numbers of the Rydberg state, atoms extracted from the polaron
cloud form dimers with the impurity. By performing first principle calculations
of the absorption spectrum based on a functional determinant approach, we show
how the occupation of the dimer state can be directly observed in spectroscopy
experiments and can be mapped onto the density profile of the gas particles,
hence providing a direct, real-time, and in-situ measure of the polaron cloud.

present analyses of our observations of the comet taken from the LOOK project

splitting. The two fragments Components A and B, estimated to be $\sim\!60$ m
to 4 km in radius, remained highly similar to each other in terms of
brightness, colour, and dust morphology throughout our observing campaign from
2020 September to 2021 December. Our fragmentation model yielded that the two
components split at a relative speed of $3.00 \pm 0.18$ m s$^{-1}$ in 2020 late
April, implying a specific energy change of $\left(5.3 \pm 2.8 \right) \times
10^3$ J kg$^{-1}$, and that Component B was subjected to a stronger
nongravitational acceleration than Component A in both the radial and normal
directions of the orbit. The obtained splitting time is broadly consistent with
the result from the dust morphology analysis, which further suggested that the
dominant dust grains were millimeter-sized and ejected at speed $\sim\!2$ m
s$^{-1}$. We postulate that the pre-split nucleus of the comet consisted of two
lobes resembling the one of 67P, or that the comet used to be a binary system

We suggest the first DSL for garment modeling -- GarmentCode -- that applies
principles of object-oriented programming to garment construction and allows

focusing on phonemes and syllables. Additionally, we present a new dataset of
40 onomatopoeia-dance motion pairs collected through a user survey. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method enables more intuitive dance generation

representation learning ability. For addressing this issue, a Proximal
Symmetric Nonnegative Latent-factor-analysis (PSNL) model is proposed. It
incorporates a proximal term into symmetry-aware and data density-oriented
objective function for high representation accuracy. Then an adaptive
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based learning scheme is
implemented through a Tree-structured of Parzen Estimators (TPE) method for

dataset by leveraging prior knowledge of a labeled set comprising disjoint but
related classes. Given that most existing literature focuses primarily on
utilizing supervised knowledge from a labeled set at the methodology level,
this paper considers the question: Is supervised knowledge always helpful at
different levels of semantic relevance? To proceed, we first establish a novel
metric, so-called transfer flow, to measure the semantic similarity between
labeled/unlabeled datasets. To show the validity of the proposed metric, we
build up a large-scale benchmark with various degrees of semantic similarities
between labeled/unlabeled datasets on ImageNet by leveraging its hierarchical
class structure. The results based on the proposed benchmark show that the
proposed transfer flow is in line with the hierarchical class structure; and
that NCD performance is consistent with the semantic similarities (measured by
the proposed metric). Next, by using the proposed transfer flow, we conduct
various empirical experiments with different levels of semantic similarity,
yielding that supervised knowledge may hurt NCD performance. Specifically,
using supervised information from a low-similarity labeled set may lead to a
suboptimal result as compared to using pure self-supervised knowledge. These
results reveal the inadequacy of the existing NCD literature which usually
assumes that supervised knowledge is beneficial. Finally, we develop a
pseudo-version of the transfer flow as a practical reference to decide if
supervised knowledge should be used in NCD. Its effectiveness is supported by
our empirical studies, which show that the pseudo transfer flow (with or
without supervised knowledge) is consistent with the corresponding accuracy
based on various datasets. Code is released at

affective responses of humans to external events and they are tightly
intertwined with each other. Such events may be expressed in multiple

conversations. Joint analysis of humans' multi-modal sarcasm, sentiment, and
emotion is an important yet challenging topic, as it is a complex cognitive
process involving both cross-modality interaction and cross-affection
correlation. From the probability theory perspective, cross-affection
correlation also means that the judgments on sarcasm, sentiment, and emotion
are incompatible. However, this exposed phenomenon cannot be sufficiently
modelled by classical probability theory due to its assumption of
compatibility. Neither do the existing approaches take it into consideration.
In view of the recent success of quantum probability (QP) in modeling human

first step towards introducing QP into joint multi-modal sarcasm, sentiment,

CentRA, the first algorithm based on progressive sampling to compute
high-quality approximations of the set of k most central nodes. CentRA is based
on a novel approach to efficiently estimate Monte Carlo Rademacher Averages, a
powerful tool from statistical learning theory to compute sharp data-dependent

maximization using the VC-dimension, a key concept from statistical learning
theory. We show that the number of random samples required to compute
high-quality approximations scales with finer characteristics of the graph,
such as its vertex diameter, or of the centrality of interest, significantly
improving looser bounds derived from standard techniques. We apply CentRA to

  Two very distinct approaches to logic are currently providing interesting
contributions to this debate. The first, oftentimes called logical ecumenism,
aims to provide a unified framework in which two ""rival"" logics may peacefully
coexist, thus providing some sort of neutral ground for the contestants. The
second, proof-theoretic semantics, aims not only to elucidate the meaning of a

recent years. These models learn a vector representation of knowledge graph
entities and relations, a.k.a. knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). Learning
versatile KGEs is desirable as it makes them useful for a broad range of tasks.
However, KGEMs are usually trained for a specific task, which makes their
embeddings task-dependent. In parallel, the widespread assumption that KGEMs
actually create a semantic representation of the underlying entities and
relations (e.g., project similar entities closer than dissimilar ones) has been
challenged. In this work, we design heuristics for generating protographs --
small, modified versions of a KG that leverage schema-based information. The
learnt protograph-based embeddings are meant to encapsulate the semantics of a
KG, and can be leveraged in learning KGEs that, in turn, also better capture
semantics. Extensive experiments on various evaluation benchmarks demonstrate
the soundness of this approach, which we call Modular and Agnostic SCHema-based
Integration of protograph Embeddings (MASCHInE). In particular, MASCHInE helps
produce more versatile KGEs that yield substantially better performance for
entity clustering and node classification tasks. For link prediction, using
MASCHInE has little impact on rank-based performance but increases the number

contrast between SDE and parallel DDE signals at the same b-value.
Multi-Gaussian exchange (MGE) is a diffusion MRI framework that utilises DDE to
measure exchange. The highest exchange sensitivity in MGE is obtained by
contrasting SDE and DDE signals at the same b-value. CTI and MGE can thus be
applied to analyse the same data but provide conflicting interpretations of
that data. We perform Monte Carlo simulations in different geometries with
varying levels of exchange to determine which approach is more compatible with
the data. Simulations reveal that in all microstructures considered, CTI
microscopic kurtosis drastically increases when exchange is introduced.
Furthermore, in microstructures that are well-described by the multi-Gaussian
assumption, CTI-estimated microscopic kurtosis increases with both the exchange
rate and the mixing time, despite fulfilment of the long-mixing-time condition
of CTI. Increasing the exchange rate by a factor of 2 positively biases CTI
microscopic kurtosis by approximately the same factor. At a modest exchange
rate of 10 /s, varying the mixing time from 12 to 100 ms increases CTI
microscopic kurtosis by at least a factor of 3. To address this problem, we
propose a heuristic approach to combine CTI and MGE to estimate
intra-compartmental kurtosis unconfounded by exchange and demonstrate its

energy characterizing the source spectra, reflecting the many different
properties inherent to the most commonly assumed UHECR accelerators. A recent
analysis of Auger and TA data exposed strong evidence for a correlation between
UHECRs and nearby starburst galaxies, with a global significance post-trial of
$4.7\sigma$. Since these galaxies are in our cosmic backyard, the flux
attenuation factor due to cosmic ray interactions en route to Earth turns out
to be negligible. This implies that for each source, the shape of the observed
spectrum should roughly match the emission spectrum, providing a unique testing
ground for the dark dimension hypothesis. Using Auger data, we carry out a
maximum likelihood analysis to characterize the shape of the UHECR emission
from the galaxies dominating the anisotropy signal. We show that the observed
spectra could be universal only if $\lambda \lesssim 10^{-3}$.

  It was found that flare-driven changes to chemical composition and
temperature give rise to prolonged trends in evolution across a broad range of
pressure levels and species. Allowing feedback between chemistry and
temperature plays an important role in establishing the quiescent structure of
these atmospheres, and determines their evolution due to flares. It was found
that cooler planets are more susceptible to flares than warmer ones, seeing
larger changes in composition and temperature, and that temperature-chemistry
feedback modifies their evolution.
  Long-term exposure to flares changes the transmission spectra of gas giant
atmospheres; these changes differed when the temperature structure was allowed
to evolve self-consistently with the chemistry. Changes in spectral features
due to the effects of flares on these atmospheres can be associated with
changes in composition. The effects of flares on the atmospheres of
sufficiently cool planets will impact observations made with JWST. It is

major reasons. First, the TEGR is a well established and widely accepted
formulation of the gravitational field, whose basic field strength is the
torsion tensor of the Weitzenb\""ock connection. Second, in the phase space of
the TEGR there exists an algebra of the Poincar\'e group. Not only the
definitions of the gravitational energy-momentum and 4-angular momentum satisfy
this algebra, but also the first class constraints related to these definitions
satisfy the algebra. And third, innumerous applications of these definitions
lead to physically consistent results. These definitions follow from a well
established Hamiltonian formulation, and rely on the idea of localization of
the gravitational energy. In this review we revisit the concept of
localizability of the gravitational energy, in light of results obtained in
recent years. We have studied the behaviour of free particles in the space-time
of plane fronted gravitational waves (pp-waves). Free particles are here
understood as particles that are not subject to external forces other than the
gravitational acceleration due to pp-waves. Since these particles acquire or
loose kinetic energy locally, the transfer of energy from or to the
gravitational field must also be localized. We consider this theoretical result
an important and definite argument in favour of the localization of the
gravitational energy-momentum, and by extension, of the gravitational 4-angular
momentum.

become ``human-imperceptible, machine-recognizable'' via one of the two
encryption strategies: (1) random shuffling to a set of equally-sized patches

to vision transformer to enable it to learn on the encrypted images for vision
tasks, including image classification and object detection. Extensive
experiments on ImageNet and COCO show that the proposed paradigm achieves
comparable accuracy with the competitive methods. Decrypting the encrypted
images requires solving an NP-hard jigsaw puzzle or an ill-posed inverse
problem, which is empirically shown intractable to be recovered by various

show that the proposed paradigm can ensure the encrypted images have become

training for existing video detection models. Additionally, the concealed

frame and conducts polyp detection on the current frame without multi-frame
collaborations. Specifically, for the foreground, YONA adaptively aligns the
current frame's channel activation patterns with its adjacent reference frames
according to their foreground similarity. For the background, YONA conducts
background dynamic alignment guided by inter-frame difference to eliminate the
invalid features produced by drastic spatial jitters. Moreover, YONA applies
cross-frame contrastive learning during training, leveraging the ground truth
bounding box to improve the model's perception of polyp and background.
Quantitative and qualitative experiments on three public challenging benchmarks

transmit time- and safety-critical data to monitor and control industrial

solutions to meet these requirements (e.g., priority-based real-time schedules

different vendors may come out with distinct solutions, and this makes the
large-scale integration of devices from different vendors difficult or
impossible. IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a standardization
group formed to enhance and optimize the IEEE 802.1 network standards,
especially for Ethernet-based networks. These solutions can be evolved and

consumption and event-driven property during the inference process. To take
full advantage of low power consumption and improve the efficiency of these
models further, the pruning methods have been explored to find sparse SNNs
without redundancy connections after training. However, parameter redundancy
still hinders the efficiency of SNNs during training. In the human brain, the
rewiring process of neural networks is highly dynamic, while synaptic
connections maintain relatively sparse during brain development. Inspired by
this, here we propose an efficient evolutionary structure learning (ESL)
framework for SNNs, named ESL-SNNs, to implement the sparse SNN training from
scratch. The pruning and regeneration of synaptic connections in SNNs evolve
dynamically during learning, yet keep the structural sparsity at a certain
level. As a result, the ESL-SNNs can search for optimal sparse connectivity by
exploring all possible parameters across time. Our experiments show that the
proposed ESL-SNNs framework is able to learn SNNs with sparse structures
effectively while reducing the limited accuracy. The ESL-SNNs achieve merely
0.28% accuracy loss with 10% connection density on the DVS-Cifar10 dataset. Our
work presents a brand-new approach for sparse training of SNNs from scratch
with biologically plausible evolutionary mechanisms, closing the gap in the
expressibility between sparse training and dense training. Hence, it has great
potential for SNN lightweight training and inference with low power consumption
and small memory usage.

on the concepts of fractional isomorphisms, and substructure counts via tree

the $1$-WL and MPNNs on graphons. Empirically, we validate our theoretical
findings by showing that randomly initialized MPNNs, without training, exhibit

the material ejected through radiation-driven winds and its significance for
Galactic abundances. It also reports on the evolution of pysical quantities
during the wind phase that could help constrain the mass-radius relation in
neutron stars. A non-relativistic radiative wind model was implemented and
linked, through a new technique, to a series of XRB hydrodynamic simulations,
that include over 300 isotopes. This allows us to construct a quasi-stationary
time evolution of the wind during the XRB. The simulations resulted in the
first realistic quantification of mass-loss for each isotope synthesized in the
XRB. The total mass ejected by the wind was about $6\times10^{19}g$, the
average ejected mass per unit time represents 2.6% of the accretion rate, with
0.1% of the envelope mass ejected per burst and ~90% of the ejecta composed by
$^{60}$Ni, $^{64}$Zn, $^{68}$Ge and $^{58}$Ni. The ejected material also
contained a small fraction ($10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) of some light p-nuclei, but not
enough to account for their Galactic abundances. Additionally, the observable
magnitudes during the wind phase showed remarkable correlations, some of which
involve wind parameters like energy and mass outflows, that are determined by
the conditions at the base of the wind envelope. These correlations could be
used to link observable magnitudes to the physics of the innermost parts of the

driven by an external perturber, be it a tertiary companion (as in the
Lidov-Kozai (LK) mechanism) or the tidal field of the stellar cluster in which
the binary orbits. The simplest theoretical models of these oscillations use a
'doubly-averaged' (DA) approximation, averaging both over the binary's internal
Keplerian orbit and its 'outer' barycentric orbit relative to the perturber.
However, DA theories do not account for fluctuations of the perturbing torque
on the outer orbital timescale, which are known to increase a binary's
eccentricity beyond the maximum DA value, potentially accelerating mergers.
Here we reconsider the impact of these short-timescale fluctuations in the
test-particle quadrupolar limit for binaries perturbed by arbitrary spherical
cluster potentials (including LK as a special case), {in particular including
1pN} general relativistic (GR) apsidal precession of the internal orbit.
Focusing on the behavior of the binary orbital elements around peak
eccentricity, we discover a new effect, relativistic phase space diffusion
(RPSD), in which a binary can jump to a completely new dynamical trajectory on
an outer orbital timescale, violating the approximate conservation of DA
integrals of motion. RPSD arises from an interplay between secular behavior at
extremely high eccentricity, short-timescale fluctuations, and rapid GR
precession, and can change the subsequent secular evolution dramatically. This
effect occurs even in hierarchical triples, but has not been uncovered until

quantum advantage. While there is evidence that noiseless Gaussian boson
sampling is hard to efficiently simulate using a classical computer, the
current Gaussian boson sampling experiments inevitably suffer from loss and
other noise models. Despite a high photon loss rate and the presence of noise,
they are currently claimed to be hard to classically simulate with the
best-known classical algorithm. In this work, we present a classical
tensor-network algorithm that simulates Gaussian boson sampling and whose
complexity can be significantly reduced when the photon loss rate is high. By
generalizing the existing thermal-state approximation algorithm of lossy
Gaussian boson sampling, the proposed algorithm enables us to achieve increased
accuracy as the running time of the algorithm scales, as opposed to the
algorithm that samples from the thermal state, which can give only a fixed
accuracy. The generalization allows us to assess the computational power of
current lossy experiments even though their output state is not believed to be
close to a thermal state. We then simulate the largest Gaussian boson sampling
implemented in experiments so far. Much like the actual experiments,
classically verifying this large-scale simulation is challenging. To do this,
we first observe that in our smaller-scale simulations the total variation
distance, cross-entropy, and two-point correlation benchmarks all coincide.
Based on this observation, we demonstrate for large-scale experiments that our
sampler matches the ground-truth two-point and higher-order correlation

the sources. We find a spectral flattening towards low flux density sources.
Using the spectral index limits from Apertif non-detections we derive that up

-1.2. Steepening of the spectral index with increasing redshift is also seen in
the data showing a different dependency for the low-frequency spectral index
and the high frequency one. This can be explained by a population of sources
having concave radio spectra with a turnover frequency around the LOFAR band.
Additionally, we discuss cases of individual extended sources with an
interesting resolved spectral structure. With the improved pipeline, we aim to
continue processing data from the Apertif wide-area surveys and release the
improved 1.4 GHz images of several famous fields.

representation learning for individual modalities. Thus, it provides a
versatile and efficient approach to handle limited modalities during testing.
Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the high efficiency
of MAG-MS and its superior segmentation performance than current
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, using MAG-MS, we provide valuable
insight and guidance on selecting input modalities for medical image
segmentation tasks.

algorithms and efficient quantum error correction protocols. Geometric phase,
as a key element with intrinsic fault-tolerant feature, can be well integrated
into quantum control processes to enhance control robustness. However, the
current geometric quantum control is still controversial in robust
universality, which leads to the unsatisfactory result that cannot sufficiently
enhance the robustness of arbitrary type of geometric gate. In this study, we
find that the finite choice on geometric evolution trajectory is one of the
main roots that constrain the control robustness of previous geometric schemes,
as it is unable to optionally avoid some trajectory segments that are seriously
affected by systematic errors. In view of this, we here propose a new scheme
for universal robust geometric control based on geometric trajectory
correction, where enough available evolution parameters are introduced to
ensure that the effective correction against systematic errors can be executed.
From the results of our numerical simulation, arbitrary type of geometric gate
implemented by using the corrected geometric trajectory has absolute robustness
advantages over conventional quantum one. In addition, we also verify the
feasibility of the high-fidelity physical implementation of our scheme in
superconducting quantum circuit, and finally discuss in detail the potential
researches based on our scheme. Therefore, our theoretical work is expected to
offer an attractive avenue for realizing practical fault-tolerant quantum
computation in existing experimental platforms.

numerical integrators that are accurate and fast. The challenge is often
formidable because the chaotic nature of many systems requires relative
numerical error bounds at or close to machine precision (~1e-16,
double-precision arithmetic), otherwise numerical chaos may dominate over
physical chaos. Currently, the speed/accuracy demands are usually only met by
symplectic integrators. For example, the most up-to-date long-term astronomical
solutions for the solar system in the past (widely used in, e.g.,
astrochronology and high-precision geological dating) have been obtained using
symplectic integrators. Yet, the source codes of these integrators are
unavailable. Here I present the symplectic integrator orbitN (lean version 1.0)
with the primary goal of generating accurate and reproducible long-term orbital
solutions for near-Keplerian planetary systems (here the solar system) with a
dominant mass M0. Among other features, orbitN-1.0 includes M0's quadrupole
moment, a lunar contribution, and post-Newtonian corrections (1PN) due to M0
(fast symplectic implementation). To reduce numerical roundoff errors, Kahan
compensated summation was implemented. I use orbitN to provide insight into the
effect of various processes on the long-term chaos in the solar system.
Notably, 1PN corrections have the opposite effect on chaoticity/stability on
100-Myr vs. Gyr-time scale. For the current application, orbitN is about as
fast or faster (factor 1.15-2.6) than comparable integrators, depending on
hardware. The orbitN source code (C) is available at github.com/rezeebe/orbitN.

galactic chemical evolution results in variations in the relative abundances of
rock-forming elements spatially and temporally on galaxy-wide scales, the
current sample of polluted white dwarfs are sufficiently young and close to
Earth that they are not affected by this process. We conclude that exotic

The monochromatic opacities computed with the SYNSPEC code are used to
construct opacity distribution function (ODF) that is then verified through
detailed comparison with the results of the ATLAS code. The opacity binning
method is implemented with the SYNSPEC opacities for four representative cool
main-sequence stellar spectral types (F3V, G2V, K0V, and M2V). Results. The
ODFs from SYNSPEC and ATLAS show consistent results for the opacity and
bolometric radiative energy exchange rate Q in case of the F, G, and K -- type
stars. Significant differences, coming mainly from the molecular line lists,
are found for the M -- type star. It is possible to optimise a small number of
bins to reduce the deviation of the results coming from the opacity grouping
with respect to the ODF for the F, G, and K -- type stars. In the case of the M
-- type star, the inclusion of splitting in wavelength is needed in the
grouping to get similar results, with a subsequent increase in computing time.
In the limit of a large number of bins, the deviation for all the binning
configurations tested saturates and the results do not converge to the ODF
solution. Due to this saturation, the Q rate cannot be improved by increasing
the number of bins to more than about 20 bins. The more effective strategy is
to select the optimal location of fewer bins.

the viscoelastic one (of Brinkman's type) and the inviscid one (of Darcy's

sequence of user-cascade and user-user interactions and then chronologically
learns on the sequence by maintaining the dynamic states of users and cascades.
Specifically, for each interaction, we present an evolution learning module to
continuously update the dynamic states of the related users and cascade based
on their currently encoded messages and previous dynamic states. We also devise
a cascade representation learning component to embed the temporal information

robots capable of performing multiple tasks at an expert level. Most work in
this field is focused on the development of more sophisticated learning
algorithms for a robot's controller given a largely static and presupposed
robotic design. By focusing on the development of robotic bodies, rather than
neural controllers, I have discovered that robots can be designed such that
they overcome many of the current pitfalls encountered by neural controllers in
multitask settings. Through this discovery, I also present novel metrics to
explicitly measure the learning ability of a robotic design and its resistance
to common problems such as catastrophic interference.
  Traditionally, the physical robot design requires human engineers to plan
every aspect of the system, which is expensive and often relies on human
intuition. In contrast, within the field of evolutionary robotics, evolutionary
algorithms are used to automatically create optimized designs, however, such
designs are often still limited in their ability to perform in a multitask
setting. The metrics created and presented here give a novel path to automated
design that allow evolved robots to synergize with their controller to improve
the computational efficiency of their learning while overcoming catastrophic
interference.
  Overall, this dissertation intimates the ability to automatically design
robots that are more general purpose than current robots and that can perform
various tasks while requiring less computation.

heuristic PdM policies or algorithms' hyperparameters. The effect of different
PdM policies on the metric is initially investigated through a theoretical
numerical example. Subsequently, we employ four data-driven prognostic
algorithms on a simulated turbofan engine degradation problem, and investigate
the joint effect of prognostic algorithm and PdM policy on the metric,

transient events on the Sun and magnetically active stars, solar and stellar
flares. The light curves of flare events from the Sun and stars show remarkably
similar shapes, typically with a sharp rise and protracted decay phase. The
duration of solar and stellar flares has been found to be correlated with the
intensity of the event in some wavelengths, such as white light, but not in
other wavelengths, such as soft X-rays, but it is not evident why this is the
case. In this study, we use a radiative hydrodynamics code to examine factors
affecting the duration of flare emission at various wavelengths. The duration
of a light curve depends on the temperature of the plasma, the height in the
atmosphere at which the emission forms, and the relative importance of cooling
due to radiation, thermal conduction, and enthalpy flux. We find that there is
a clear distinction between emission that forms low in the atmosphere and
responds directly to heating, and emission that forms in the corona, indirectly
responding to heating-induced chromospheric evaporation, a facet of the Neupert

subject to the laws of physics. Through an analysis of the Turing machine, it
becomes evident that Turing and his contemporaries overlooked a physical
possibility: information carriers can be quantum systems. As a result,
computing models like the Turing machine can only process classical
information, limiting their computing power. G\""odel's incompleteness theorem
highlights the basic fact that mathematicians and computers are made up of
finite numbers of atoms and molecules. They can only start with a finite number
of axioms, use a finite number of symbols and deduction rules, and arrive at
theorems with a finite number of steps. While the number of proofs may be
infinite after including all future mathematicians and computers, they must
still be enumerable. In contrast, the number of mathematical statements is
uncountable, meaning that there will always be mathematical statements that

performed to investigate implant-induced artefacts and artefact reduction
methods more in-depth. This study describes the design and evaluation of a
realistic head phantom for pre-clinical implant-induced artefact testing in a
relevant environment. A case study is performed where a state-of-the-art
piezoelectric bone conduction implant is used in the 1.5 T and 3 T MRI
environments. Images were acquired using clinical and novel metal artefact
reducing (MARS) sequences at both field strengths. Artefact width and length
were measured in a healthy volunteer and compared with artefact sizes obtained
in the phantom. Artefact sizes are reported that are similar in shape between
the phantom and a volunteer, yet with dimensions differing up to 20% between
both. When the implant magnet is removed, the artefact size can be reduced
below a diameter of 5 cm, whilst the presence of an implant magnet and splint
creates higher artefacts up to 20 cm in diameter. Pulse sequences have been
altered to reduce the scan time up to 7 minutes, while preserving the image
quality. These results show that the anthropomorphic phantom can be used at a
preclinical stage to provide clinically relevant images, illustrating the

conservative approach would be to combine only trials conducted in the
biomarker-positive subgroup. However, this discards potentially useful
information on treatment effects in the biomarker-positive subgroup concealed
within observed treatment effects in biomarker-mixed populations. We extend
standard random-effects meta-analysis to combine treatment effects obtained
from trials with different populations to estimate pooled treatment effects in
a biomarker subgroup of interest. The model assumes a systematic difference in
treatment effects between biomarker-positive and biomarker-negative subgroups,
which is estimated from trials which report either or both treatment effects.
The estimated systematic difference and proportion of biomarker-negative
patients in biomarker-mixed studies are used to interpolate treatment effects
in the biomarker-positive subgroup from observed treatment effects in the
biomarker-mixed population. The developed methods are applied to an
illustrative example in metastatic colorectal cancer and evaluated in a
simulation study. In the example, the developed method resulted in improved
precision of the pooled treatment effect estimate compared to standard
random-effects meta-analysis of trials investigating only biomarker-positive
patients. The simulation study confirmed that when the systematic difference in
treatment effects between biomarker subgroups is not very large, the developed

  models of inferotemporal visual cortex",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the most impactful findings in computational neuroscience over the
past decade is that the object recognition accuracy of deep neural networks
(DNNs) correlates with their ability to predict neural responses to natural
images in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex. This discovery supported the
long-held theory that object recognition is a core objective of the visual
cortex, and suggested that more accurate DNNs would serve as better models of
IT neuron responses to images. Since then, deep learning has undergone a
revolution of scale: billion parameter-scale DNNs trained on billions of images
are rivaling or outperforming humans at visual tasks including object
recognition. Have today's DNNs become more accurate at predicting IT neuron
responses to images as they have grown more accurate at object recognition?
  Surprisingly, across three independent experiments, we find this is not the
case. DNNs have become progressively worse models of IT as their accuracy has
increased on ImageNet. To understand why DNNs experience this trade-off and
evaluate if they are still an appropriate paradigm for modeling the visual
system, we turn to recordings of IT that capture spatially resolved maps of
neuronal activity elicited by natural images. These neuronal activity maps
reveal that DNNs trained on ImageNet learn to rely on different visual features
than those encoded by IT and that this problem worsens as their accuracy
increases. We successfully resolved this issue with the neural harmonizer, a
plug-and-play training routine for DNNs that aligns their learned
representations with humans. Our results suggest that harmonized DNNs break the
trade-off between ImageNet accuracy and neural prediction accuracy that assails
current DNNs and offer a path to more accurate models of biological vision.

  metamorphosis of the running scale","26 pages",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We discuss the structure of nonlocal effective action generating the
conformal anomaly in classically Weyl invariant theories in curved spacetime.
By the procedure of conformal gauge fixing, selecting the metric representative
on a conformal group orbit, we split the renormalized effective action into
anomalous and Weyl invariant parts. A wide family of thus obtained anomalous
actions is shown to include two special cases of Riegert--Fradkin--Tseytlin and
Fradkin--Vilkovisky actions. Both actions are shown to be contained in the
first three orders of the curvature expansion for a generic one-loop effective
action obtained by covariant perturbation theory. The complementary Weyl
invariant part of the action is given by the ``conformization'' of the full
effective action -- restricting its argument to the conformally invariant
representative of the orbit of the conformal group. This is likely to resolve a
long-standing debate between the proponents of the Riegert action and adherents
of the perturbation expansion for the effective action with typical nonlocal
logarithmic form factors. We derive the relation between quantum stress tensors
on conformally related metric backgrounds, which generalizes the known
Brown-Cassidy equation to the case of nonzero Weyl tensor, and discuss
applications of this relation in the cosmological model driven by conformal
field theory. We also discuss the issue of renormalization group running for
the cosmological and gravitational coupling constants and show that it exhibits
a kind of a metamorphosis to the nonlocal form factors of the so-called
partners of the cosmological and Einstein terms -- nonlocal curvature squared
terms of the effective action.

In the regime where the model dimensions grow faster than any constant multiple

governed by the phase transition in the signal-to-noise ratio. They also
asymptotically agree with each other when the number of samples grow faster

illustrate finer distributional properties of the two quantities for finite

the large values of a random potential, and a self-repellent one in the spirit
of the well-known weakly self-avoiding random walk. We take the potential to be
i.i.d.~Pareto-distributed with parameter $\alpha>d$, and we tune the strength
of the interactions in such a way that they both contribute on the same scale

  Our main results are (1) the identification of the logarithmic asymptotics of
the partition function of the model in terms of a random variational formula,
and, (2) the identification of the path behaviour that gives the overwhelming
contribution to the partition function for $\alpha>2d$: the random-walk path
follows an optimal trajectory that visits each of a finite number of random
lattice sites for a positive random fraction of time. We prove a law of large
numbers for this behaviour, i.e., that all other path behaviours give strictly
less contribution to the partition function. The joint distribution of the
variational problem and of the optimal path can be expressed in terms of a
limiting Poisson point process arising by a rescaling of the random potential.
The latter convergence is in distribution and is in the spirit of a standard
extreme-value setting for a rescaling of an i.i.d. potential in large boxes,
like in \cite{KLMS09}.

In high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) plasmas, the ions have also

loaded unsafely, and III) unusable image. By applying several architectures of
convolutional neural networks (CNN), it can be shown that it is possible to
distinguish between unusable and usable images for cargo safety assessment.
This distinction is quite crucial since the truck driver and the loadmaster

Markovian noise and cavity disorders with specific attention to entanglement
sudden death and revivals. The study is focused on the glassy disorders, which
remain unchanged during the observations. The field is initially assumed to be
in a vacuum state, while the atoms are considered to be in a specific two-qubit
superposition state. Specifically, the study has revealed that the presence of
noise, or a nonlinear pump results in interesting behaviors in the entanglement
dynamics. Further, entanglement sudden death is observed in the presence of
Markovian noise and nonlinear pump. The presence of entanglement sudden deaths
and revivals have also been observed in cases where they were absent initially
for the chosen states. The effect of noise on the dynamics of the system is to
decay the characteristics, while that of the disorder is to wash them out. On
the other hand, the introduction of nonlinearity is found to cause the dynamics
of the system to speed up.

non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions, where the extensive bulk
eigenstates tend to accumulate at the lattice edges. In this article, we
investigate how an electric field affects the localization properties in a
non-Hermitian mosaic Stark lattice, exploring the interplay between the Stark
localization, mobility edge (ME), and the NHSE induced by nonreciprocity. We
analytically obtain the Lyapunov exponent and the phase transition points as
well as numerically calculate the density distributions and the spectral
winding number. We reveal that in the nonreciprocal Stark lattice with the
mosaic periodic parameter $\kappa=1$, there exists a critical electric field
strength that describes the transition of the existence-nonexistence of NHSE
and is inversely proportional to the lattice size. This transition is
consistent with the real-complex transition and topological transition
characterized by spectral winding number under periodic boundary conditions. In
the strong fields, the Wannier-Stark ladder is recovered, and the Stark
localization is sufficient to suppress the NHSE. When the mosaic period
$\kappa=2$, we show that the system manifests an exact non-Hermitian ME and the
skin states are still existing in the strong fields, in contrast to the
gigantic field can restrain the NHSE in the $\kappa=1$ case. Moreover, we
further study the expansion dynamics of an initially localized state and
dynamically probe the existence of the NHSE and the non-Hermitian ME. These
results could help us to control the NHSE and the non-Hermitian ME by using
electric fields in the disorder-free systems.

central open question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of
intelligence itself. A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in
Papadimitriou [2020] and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical
proofs and simulations, to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive
operations via the creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However,
many intelligent behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and
manipulate temporal sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to
list a few). Here we show that, in the same model, time can be captured
naturally as precedence through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a
result, a range of computations on sequences of assemblies can be carried out.
In particular, repeated presentation of a sequence of stimuli leads to the
memorization of the sequence through corresponding neural assemblies: upon
future presentation of any stimulus in the sequence, the corresponding assembly
and its subsequent ones will be activated, one after the other, until the end
of the sequence. Finally, we show that any finite state machine can be learned
in a similar way, through the presentation of appropriate patterns of
sequences. Through an extension of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be
capable of universal computation. We support our analysis with a number of
experiments to probe the limits of learning in this model in key ways. Taken
together, these results provide a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the

big-data-related application concerning the complex interactions among numerous
nodes, e.g., a protein interaction network from a bioinformatics application. A
Symmetric High-Dimensional and Incomplete (SHDI) matrix can smoothly illustrate
such an UWN, which contains rich knowledge like node interaction behaviors and
local complexes. To extract desired knowledge from an SHDI matrix, an analysis
model should carefully consider its symmetric-topology for describing an UWN's
intrinsic symmetry. Representation learning to an UWN borrows the success of a
pyramid of symmetry-aware models like a Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix
Factorization (SNMF) model whose objective function utilizes a sole Latent
Factor (LF) matrix for representing SHDI's symmetry rigorously. However, they
suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) their computational complexity is high;
and 2) their modeling strategy narrows their representation features, making
them suffer from low learning ability. Aiming at addressing above critical
issues, this paper proposes a Multi-constrained Symmetric Nonnegative
Latent-factor-analysis (MSNL) model with two-fold ideas: 1) introducing
multi-constraints composed of multiple LF matrices, i.e., inequality and
equality ones into a data-density-oriented objective function for precisely
representing the intrinsic symmetry of an SHDI matrix with broadened feature
space; and 2) implementing an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM)-incorporated learning scheme for precisely solving such a
multi-constrained model. Empirical studies on three SHDI matrices from a real
bioinformatics or industrial application demonstrate that the proposed MSNL
model achieves stronger representation learning ability to an SHDI matrix than
state-of-the-art models do.

indicate that galaxy formation must have taken place much earlier than expected
in this model. Another viable class of cosmological models is that of the
so-called coasting models, in which the scale factor of the universe varies
proportionately with time. In these models, the universe at redshift $z=12$ has
ample time ($\sim 1070$ Myrs) for galaxy formation. The earliest such model is
the one proposed by E.A. Milne, based on his `kinematic relativity', but it is
considered unrealistic for not treating gravity as relevant at cosmological
scales. A closed version of an eternal coasting FLRW model was proposed by the
present authors even before SNe Ia data began to pour in. Subsequently we
developed a more general model of the same class, which is valid for all the
three possible geometries, with open, closed or flat spatial sections. In the
nonrelativistic era, this model makes the falsifiable prediction that the ratio
of matter density to dark energy density is 2. This avoids the cosmic
coincidence problem. Moreover, this eternal coasting model allows room for
creation of matter from dark energy, that may speed up galaxy and structure
formation at the early epochs, as implied by the JWST data. The paper also
attempts to review some similar coasting models, but emphasizes the eternal
coasting cosmology as the most probable candidate model capable of explaining
the presence of high redshift galaxies discovered by JWST.

with addition-{\L}ukasiewicz composition. We mainly establish two necessary and
sufficient conditions that a solution of the fuzzy relational inequalities is a
minimal one and explore the existence condition of the unique minimal solution.
We also show that for each solution of the fuzzy relational inequalities there
is a minimal one that is less than or equal to the solution, and supply an
algorithm to search for minimal solutions of a given solution to the fuzzy
relational inequalities, which is explained by using numerical examples.

approaches usually exploit the visual backbone in a passive way, i.e., the
visual backbone extracts features with fixed weights without expression-related
hints. The passive perception may lead to mismatches (e.g., redundant and
missing), limiting further performance improvement. Ideally, the visual
backbone should actively extract visual features since the expressions already
provide the blueprint of desired visual features. The active perception can
take expressions as priors to extract relevant visual features, which can
effectively alleviate the mismatches. Inspired by this, we propose an active
perception Visual Grounding framework based on Language Adaptive Weights,
called VG-LAW. The visual backbone serves as an expression-specific feature
extractor through dynamic weights generated for various expressions. Benefiting
from the specific and relevant visual features extracted from the
language-aware visual backbone, VG-LAW does not require additional modules for
cross-modal interaction. Along with a neat multi-task head, VG-LAW can be
competent in referring expression comprehension and segmentation jointly.
Extensive experiments on four representative datasets, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+,
RefCOCOg, and ReferItGame, validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework
and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

management system that provides a data-driven approach to three use cases: (i)
analyze traffic information to reduce the risk of traffic collisions and
improve driver and pedestrian safety, (ii) identify when and where energy
consumption can be reduced to improve cost savings, and (iii) detect
maintenance issues like potholes in the city's roads and sidewalks, as well as
the beginning of hazards like floods and fires. A case study in Aveiro City

  Point-Level Consistency","IJCAI 2023 accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective transformer framework for
self-supervised learning called DenseDINO to learn dense visual
representations. To exploit the spatial information that the dense prediction
tasks require but neglected by the existing self-supervised transformers, we
introduce point-level supervision across views in a novel token-based way.
Specifically, DenseDINO introduces some extra input tokens called reference
tokens to match the point-level features with the position prior. With the
reference token, the model could maintain spatial consistency and deal with
multi-object complex scene images, thus generalizing better on dense prediction
tasks. Compared with the vanilla DINO, our approach obtains competitive
performance when evaluated on classification in ImageNet and achieves a large
margin (+7.2% mIoU) improvement in semantic segmentation on PascalVOC under the
linear probing protocol for segmentation.

  War","9 pages",,,,"cs.CY cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The present-day Russia-Ukraine military conflict has exposed the pivotal role
of social media in enabling the transparent and unbridled sharing of
information directly from the frontlines. In conflict zones where freedom of
expression is constrained and information warfare is pervasive, social media
has emerged as an indispensable lifeline. Anonymous social media platforms, as
publicly available sources for disseminating war-related information, have the
potential to serve as effective instruments for monitoring and documenting
Human Rights Violations (HRV). Our research focuses on the analysis of data
from Telegram, the leading social media platform for reading independent news
in post-Soviet regions. We gathered a dataset of posts sampled from 95 public
Telegram channels that cover politics and war news, which we have utilized to
identify potential occurrences of HRV. Employing a mBERT-based text classifier,
we have conducted an analysis to detect any mentions of HRV in the Telegram
data. Our final approach yielded an $F_2$ score of 0.71 for HRV detection,
representing an improvement of 0.38 over the multilingual BERT base model. We
release two datasets that contains Telegram posts: (1) large corpus with over
2.3 millions posts and (2) annotated at the sentence-level dataset to indicate
HRVs. The Telegram posts are in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war. We posit
that our findings hold significant implications for NGOs, governments, and
researchers by providing a means to detect and document possible human rights
violations.

ubiquitous across science and engineering. Bayesian approaches to the problem
are the gold standard as they allow for the quantification of uncertainties and
enable the seamless fusion of different experimental modalities. When the
dynamics are discrete and stochastic, one may employ powerful techniques such
as Kalman, particle, or variational filters. Practitioners commonly apply these
methods to continuous-time, deterministic dynamical systems after discretizing
the dynamics and introducing fictitious transition probabilities. However,
approaches based on time-discretization suffer from the curse of dimensionality
since the number of random variables grows linearly with the number of
time-steps. Furthermore, the introduction of fictitious transition
probabilities is an unsatisfactory solution because it increases the number of
model parameters and may lead to inference bias. To address these drawbacks,
the objective of this paper is to develop a scalable Bayesian approach to state
and parameter estimation suitable for continuous-time, deterministic dynamical
systems. Our methodology builds upon information field theory. Specifically, we
construct a physics-informed prior probability measure on the function space of
system responses so that functions that satisfy the physics are more likely.
This prior allows us to quantify model form errors. We connect the system's
response to observations through a probabilistic model of the measurement
process. The joint posterior over the system responses and all parameters is
given by Bayes' rule. To approximate the intractable posterior, we develop a
stochastic variational inference algorithm. In summary, the developed
methodology offers a powerful framework for Bayesian estimation in dynamical
systems.

propose a novel approach that assumes the formation of a small, deconfined, and

rescattering and hadronization. We make use of the same in-medium hadronization
mechanism developed for heavy-ion collisions, which involves local
color-neutralization through recombination of charm quarks with nearby opposite

of diquark excitations in the hot medium, which promotes the formation of
charmed baryons. Moreover, the recombination process, involving closely aligned
partons from the same fluid cell, effectively transfers the collective flow of
the system to the final charmed hadrons. We show that this framework can
qualitatively reproduce the observed experimental findings in heavy-flavor

tree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the
connectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The
nodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,
these neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major
drawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years
to more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these
methods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we
propose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the
same level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a
neural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information
transfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of
the method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the
traditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN
and propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our
model, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and
edges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity
constraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned
structure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized
structure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum
cut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This
learning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.
The obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned

information under the assumption that the objective function is highly smooth

zero-order projected gradient descent algorithms, which differ in the form of
the gradient estimator. The first algorithm uses a gradient estimator based on
randomization over the $\ell_2$ sphere due to Bach and Perchet (2016). We
present an improved analysis of this algorithm on the class of highly smooth
and strongly convex functions studied in the prior work, and we derive rates of
convergence for two more general classes of non-convex functions. Namely, we
consider highly smooth functions satisfying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition
and the class of highly smooth functions with no additional property. The
second algorithm is based on randomization over the $\ell_1$ sphere, and it
extends to the highly smooth setting the algorithm that was recently proposed
for Lipschitz convex functions in Akhavan et al. (2022). We show that, in the
case of noiseless oracle, this novel algorithm enjoys better bounds on bias and
variance than the $\ell_2$ randomization and the commonly used Gaussian
randomization algorithms, while in the noisy case both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$
algorithms benefit from similar improved theoretical guarantees. The
improvements are achieved thanks to a new proof techniques based on Poincar\'e
type inequalities for uniform distributions on the $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$
spheres. The results are established under weak (almost adversarial)
assumptions on the noise. Moreover, we provide minimax lower bounds proving

planetary exploration missions. Ambitious objectives and increasingly demanding
mission constraints stress the importance associated with faster surface
mobility. Driving speeds approaching or surpassing 1 m/s have been rarely used
and their effect on performance is today unclear. This study presents
experimental evidence and preliminary observations on the impact that
increasing velocity has on the tractive performance of planetary rovers.
Single-wheel driving tests were conducted using two different metallic,
grousered wheels-one rigid and one flexible-over two different soils, olivine
sand and CaCO3-based silty soil. Experiments were conducted at speeds between
0.01-1 m/s throughout an ample range of slip ratios (5-90%). Three performance
metrics were evaluated: drawbar pull coefficient, wheel sinkage, and tractive
efficiency. Results showed similar data trends among all the cases
investigated. Drawbar pull and tractive efficiency considerably decreased for
speeds beyond 0.2 m/s. Wheel sinkage, unlike what published evidence suggested,
increased with increasing velocities. The flexible wheel performed the best at
1m/s, exhibiting 2 times higher drawbar pull and efficiency with 18% lower
sinkage under low slip conditions. Although similar data trends were obtained,
a different wheel-soil interactive behavior was observed when driving over the
different soils. Overall, despite the performance reduction experienced at
higher velocities, a speed in the range of 0.2-0.3 m/s would enable 5-10 times
faster traverses, compared to current rovers driving capability, while only
diminishing drawbar pull and efficiency by 7%. The measurements collected and
the analysis presented here lay the groundwork for initial stages in the
development of new locomotion subsystems for planetary surface exploration. At

analysis with several applications. Two canonical problems here are to find a
maxcore (subgraph of maximum min degree) and to find a densest subgraph
(subgraph of maximum average degree). Both of these problems can be solved in
polynomial time. Veldt, Benson, and Kleinberg [VBK21] introduced the
generalized $p$-mean densest subgraph problem which captures the maxcore
problem when $p=-\infty$ and the densest subgraph problem when $p=1$. They
observed that the objective leads to a supermodular function when $p \ge 1$ and
hence can be solved in polynomial time; for this case, they also developed a
simple greedy peeling algorithm with a bounded approximation ratio. In this
paper, we make several contributions. First, we prove that for any $p \in
(-\frac{1}{8}, 0) \cup (0, \frac{1}{4})$ the problem is NP-Hard and for any $p
\in (-3,0) \cup (0,1)$ the weighted version of the problem is NP-Hard, partly
resolving a question left open in [VBK21]. Second, we describe two simple
$1/2$-approximation algorithms for all $p < 1$, and show that our analysis of
these algorithms is tight. For $p > 1$ we develop a fast near-linear time
implementation of the greedy peeling algorithm from [VBK21]. This allows us to
plug it into the iterative peeling algorithm that was shown to converge to an
optimum solution [CQT22]. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms by
running extensive experiments on large graphs. Together, our results provide a
comprehensive understanding of the complexity of the $p$-mean densest subgraph

reddening and composition. As a result, most studies focus only on the
\textit{relative age} by assuming that stellar evolution calculations are
accurate and using age determinations techniques that are relatively
independent of distance and reddening. Here, we construct $20,000$ sets of
theoretical isochrones through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth
Stellar Evolution Program to measure the absolute age of the globular cluster
M92. For each model, we vary a range of input physics used in the stellar
evolution models, including opacities, nuclear reaction rates, diffusion
coefficients, atmospheric boundary conditions, helium abundance, and treatment
of convection. We also explore variations in the distance and reddening as well
as its overall metallicity and $\alpha$ enhancement. We generate simulated Hess
diagrams around the main-sequence turn-off region from each set of isochrones
and use a Voronoi binning method to fit the diagrams to HST ACS data. We find
the age of M92 to be $13.80 \pm 0.75$ Gyr. The $5.4\%$ error in the absolute
age is dominated by the uncertainty in the distance to M92 ($\sim 80\%$ of the

is an algebraic proof system that uses algebraic circuits to refute the
solvability of unsatisfiable systems of polynomial equations. One potential
drawback of IPS is that verifying an IPS proof is only known to be doable using
Polynomial Identity Testing (PIT), which is solvable by a randomized algorithm,
but whose derandomization, even into NSUBEXP, is equivalent to strong lower
bounds. However, the circuits that are used in IPS proofs are not arbitrary,
and it is conceivable that one could get around general PIT by leveraging some
structure in these circuits. This proposal may be even more tempting when IPS
is used as a proof system for Boolean Unsatisfiability, where the equations
themselves have additional structure.
  Our main result is that, on the contrary, one cannot get around PIT as above:
we show that IPS, even as a proof system for Boolean Unsatisfiability, can be

transmit spin-angular momentum with negligible dissipation. This quantum of a
spin wave, introduced more than nine decades ago, has always been manipulated
through magnetic dipoles, (i.e., timereversal symmetry). Here, we report the
experimental observation of chiral-spin transport in multiferroic BiFeO3, where
the spin transport is controlled by reversing the ferroelectric polarization
(i.e., spatial inversion symmetry). The ferroelectrically controlled magnons
produce an unprecedented ratio of up to 18% rectification at room temperature.
The spin torque that the magnons in BiFeO3 carry can be used to efficiently
switch the magnetization of adja-cent magnets, with a spin-torque efficiency
being comparable to the spin Hall effect in heavy metals. Utilizing such a
controllable magnon generation and transmission in BiFeO3, an alloxide,
energy-scalable logic is demonstrated composed of spin-orbit injection,
detection, and magnetoelectric control. This observation opens a new chapter of
multiferroic magnons and paves an alternative pathway towards low-dissipation
nanoelectronics.

$\chi_{\textrm{sub}}(G^2)\le 43$ when $G$ is planar, improving their bound of
135. We give even better bounds when the planar graph $G$ has larger girth.
Moreover, we show that $\chi_{\textrm{sub}}(G^{3})\le 95$, improving the

a clique or biclique as a minor. For this we introduce a family of parameters

  Insights from Explainable AI","17 pages, plus SI",,,,"q-bio.BM cond-mat.soft cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As the importance of high-throughput screening (HTS) continues to grow due to
its value in early stage drug discovery and data generation for training
machine learning models, there is a growing need for robust methods for
pre-screening compounds to identify and prevent false-positive hits. Small,
colloidally aggregating molecules are one of the primary sources of
false-positive hits in high-throughput screens, making them an ideal candidate
to target for removal from libraries using predictive pre-screening tools.
However, a lack of understanding of the causes of molecular aggregation
introduces difficulty in the development of predictive tools for detecting
aggregating molecules. Herein, we present an examination of the molecular
features differentiating datasets of aggregating and non-aggregating molecules,
as well as a machine learning approach to predicting molecular aggregation. Our
method uses explainable graph neural networks and counterfactuals to reliably
predict and explain aggregation, giving additional insights and design rules
for future screening. The integration of this method in HTS approaches will
help combat false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and
thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.

Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), particularly with the

In this paper, we present pioneering research that explores the application of
prompt tuning to stimulate speech LMs for various generation tasks, within a

extensively in recent years. In the single-pass setting with $K$ arms and $T$
trials, a regret lower bound of $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ has been proved for any
algorithm with $o(K)$ memory (Maiti et al. [NeurIPS'21]; Agarwal at al.
[COLT'22]). On the other hand, however, the previous best regret upper bound is
still $O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}\log^{1/3}(T))$, which is achieved by the streaming
implementation of the simple uniform exploration. The $O(K^{1/3}\log^{1/3}(T))$
gap leaves the open question of the tight regret bound in the single-pass MABs
with sublinear arm memory.
  In this paper, we answer this open problem and complete the picture of regret
minimization in single-pass streaming MABs. We first improve the regret lower
bound to $\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ for algorithms with $o(K)$ memory, which
matches the uniform exploration regret up to a logarithm factor in $T$. We then
show that the $\log^{1/3}(T)$ factor is not necessary, and we can achieve
$O(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ regret by finding an $\varepsilon$-best arm and committing
to it in the rest of the trials. For regret minimization with high constant
probability, we can apply the single-memory $\varepsilon$-best arm algorithms
in Jin et al. [ICML'21] to obtain the optimal bound. Furthermore, for the
expected regret minimization, we design an algorithm with a single-arm memory
that achieves $O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3}\log(K))$ regret, and an algorithm with
$O(\log^{*}(n))$-memory with the optimal $O(K^{1/3} T^{2/3})$ regret following
the $\varepsilon$-best arm algorithm in Assadi and Wang [STOC'20].
  We further tested the empirical performances of our algorithms. The
simulation results show that the proposed algorithms consistently outperform
the benchmark uniform exploration algorithm by a large margin, and on occasion,
reduce the regret by up to 70%.

PassiFi uses a passive WiFi Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) approach that

However, there is little work on evaluating the generated arcs in English

evaluating emotion arcs for low-resource languages. Work on generating emotion
arcs in low-resource languages such as those indigenous to Africa, the
Americas, and Australia is stymied by the lack of emotion-labeled resources and
large language models for those languages. Work on evaluating emotion arcs (for

quantitatively evaluates automatically generated emotion arcs. We also compare
two common ways of generating emotion arcs: Machine-Learning (ML) models and
Lexicon-Only (LexO) methods. By running experiments on 42 diverse datasets in 9
languages, we show that despite being markedly poor at instance level emotion
classification, LexO methods are highly accurate at generating emotion arcs
when aggregating information from hundreds of instances. (Predicted arcs have
correlations ranging from 0.94 to 0.99 with the gold arcs for various
emotions.) We also show that for languages with no emotion lexicons, automatic
translations of English emotion lexicons can be used to generate high-quality
emotion arcs -- correlations above 0.9 with the gold emotion arcs in all six

study investigates the feasibility of utilizing quantum annealing-based
computed tomography (QACT) with current quantum bit levels. Approach: The QACT
algorithm aims to precisely solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization
(QUBO) problems. Furthermore, a novel approach is proposed to reconstruct
images by approximating real numbers using the variational method. This
approach allows for accurate CT image reconstruction using a small number of
qubits. The study examines the impact of projection data quantity and noise on
various image sizes ranging from 4x4 to 24x24 pixels. The reconstructed results
are compared against conventional reconstruction algorithms, namely maximum
likelihood expectation maximization (MLEM) and filtered back projection (FBP).
Main result: By employing the variational approach and utilizing two qubits for
each pixel of the image, accurate reconstruction was achieved with an adequate
number of projections. Under conditions of abundant projections and lower noise
levels, the image quality in QACT outperformed that of MLEM and FBP. However,
in situations with limited projection data and in the presence of noise, the
image quality in QACT was inferior to that in MLEM. Significance: This study
developed the QACT reconstruction algorithm using the variational approach for
real-number reconstruction. Remarkably, only 2 qubits were required for each
pixel representation, demonstrating their sufficiency for accurate
reconstruction.

avoiding the need for multiple photoluminescence measurement techniques. We
validate our model by comparing the extracted implied open-circuit voltage,
effective luminescence escape probabilities, absorptivity, and absorption
coefficient with values obtained using established methods and found that our
results are consistent with previous findings. Next, we compare the implied
1-Sun radiative open-circuit voltage and radiative recombination current
obtained from our method with literature values. We then convert the implied
open-circuit voltage and implied radiative open-circuit voltage to the
injection-dependent apparent-effective and apparent-radiative carrier
lifetimes, which allow us to decouple the different recombination coefficients.
Using this lifetime analysis, we predict the efficiency losses due to each
recombination mechanism. Finally, by comparing several different thicknesses,
we conclude that the non-radiative bimolecular recombination is likely caused

single-step method to realize a multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gate with
one photonic qubit simultaneously controlling n-1 target photonic qubits, by
employing n microwave cavities coupled to one superconducting flux qutrit. This
proposal can be applied not only to implement nonhybrid multi-target-qubit

to realize hybrid multi-target-qubit controlled-phase gates using photonic
qubits with different encodings. The gate realization requires only a

integrated into our daily lives, such as assistance for visually-impaired
people and description generation in Microsoft Powerpoint. However, even the
cutting-edge IC systems (e.g., Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services) and
algorithms (e.g., OFA) could produce erroneous captions, leading to incorrect
captioning of important objects, misunderstanding, and threats to personal
safety. The existing testing approaches either fail to handle the complex form
of IC system output (i.e., sentences in natural language) or generate unnatural
images as test cases. To address these problems, we introduce Recursive Object
MElting (Rome), a novel metamorphic testing approach for validating IC systems.
Different from existing approaches that generate test cases by inserting
objects, which easily make the generated images unnatural, Rome melts (i.e.,
remove and inpaint) objects. Rome assumes that the object set in the caption of
an image includes the object set in the caption of a generated image after
object melting. Given an image, Rome can recursively remove its objects to
generate different pairs of images. We use Rome to test one widely-adopted
image captioning API and four state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. The results
show that the test cases generated by Rome look much more natural than the SOTA
IC testing approach and they achieve comparable naturalness to the original
images. Meanwhile, by generating test pairs using 226 seed images, Rome reports
a total of 9,121 erroneous issues with high precision (86.47%-92.17%). In
addition, we further utilize the test cases generated by Rome to retrain the
Oscar, which improves its performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

the two arbitrary encoding states can take various quantum states, this

quite simple because only a basic operation is needed. During the gate

this information, DG then masks conflicting prompts and enhances related

Processing and plays an important role in various tasks. The recent
breakthrough in sentence embedding is achieved by pre-trained language models
(PLMs). Despite its success, an embedded vector (Sen2Vec) representing a point
estimate does not naturally express uncertainty in a taskagnostic way. This
paper thereby proposes an efficient framework on probabilistic sentence
embedding (Sen2Pro) from PLMs, and it represents a sentence as a probability
density distribution in an embedding space to reflect both model uncertainty
and data uncertainty (i.e., many-to-one nature) in the sentence representation.
The proposed framework performs in a plug-and-play way without retraining PLMs
anymore, and it is easy to implement and generally applied on top of any PLM.
The superiority of Sen2Pro over Sen2Vec has been theoretically verified and
practically illustrated on different NLP tasks.

quasi-thermal to non-thermal emission. The quasi-thermal emission is always
well described by a multi-color blackbody function, and based on this modeling,
a characteristic temperature with corresponding flux is taken as a probe to
diagnose the magnetization properties of the central engine with the `top-down'
approach proposed by Gao \& Zhang. Furthermore, the initial radius of the
acceleration for the outflow as well as the magnetization parameter
($\sigma_0$) could be constrained to within a narrower range than those with a
pair of temperature and flux from modeling with a single blackbody plus an
empirical function (BAND function or exponential cut-off power law). We apply
this method to some bursts with known emission properties, such as GRB 210121A
from a typical pure hot fireball and GRB 210610B from a hybrid jet. It is found
that this method works well on these control samples. With this method, we find
it is suggestive that the photospheric emission of GRB 221022B is mainly from a
fireball, rather than from a hybrid jet, while the non-thermal component is
caused by internal shock (IS) mechanism, due to the increasing Lorentz Factor
with time.

promise the accuracy of first principles methods while retaining the low cost
and parallel efficiency of empirical potentials. While ML potentials
traditionally use atom-centered descriptors as inputs, different models such as
linear regression and neural networks can map these descriptors to atomic
energies and forces. This begs the question: what is the improvement in
accuracy due to model complexity irrespective of choice of descriptors? We
curate three datasets to investigate this question in terms of ab initio energy
and force errors: (1) solid and liquid silicon, (2) gallium nitride, and (3)
the superionic conductor LGPS. We further investigate how these errors affect
simulated properties with these models and verify if the improvement in fitting
errors corresponds to measurable improvement in property prediction. Since
linear and nonlinear regression models have different advantages and
disadvantages, the results presented herein help researchers choose models for
their particular application. By assessing different models, we observe
correlations between fitting quantity (e.g. atomic force) error and simulated
property error with respect to ab initio values. Such observations can be
repeated by other researchers to determine the level of accuracy, and hence
model complexity, needed for their particular systems of interest.

variants for differential privacy all suffer from \textbf{the curse of
full-rank covariance matrices}, and hence the expected accuracy losses of these
mechanisms applied to high dimensional query results, e.g., in $\mathbb{R}^M$,
all increase linearly with $M$.
  To lift this curse, we design a Rank-1 Singular Multivariate Gaussian
Mechanism (R1SMG). It achieves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP on query results in
$\mathbb{R}^M$ by perturbing the results with noise following a singular
multivariate Gaussian distribution, whose covariance matrix is a
\textbf{randomly} generated rank-1 positive semi-definite matrix. In contrast,
the classic Gaussian mechanism and its variants all consider
\textbf{deterministic} full-rank covariance matrices. Our idea is motivated by
a clue from Dwork et al.'s work on Gaussian mechanism that has been ignored in
the literature: when projecting multivariate Gaussian noise with a full-rank
covariance matrix onto a set of orthonormal basis in $\mathbb{R}^M$, only the
coefficient of a single basis can contribute to the privacy guarantee.
  This paper makes the following technical contributions.
  (i) R1SMG achieves $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee on query results in
$\mathbb{R}^M$, while the magnitude of the additive noise decreases with $M$.
Therefore, \textbf{less is more}, i.e., less amount of noise is able to
sanitize higher dimensional query results. When $M\rightarrow \infty$, the
expected accuracy loss converges to ${2(\Delta_2f)^2}/{\epsilon}$, where
$\Delta_2f$ is the $l_2$ sensitivity of the query function $f$.
  (ii) Compared with other mechanisms, R1SMG is less likely to generate noise
with large magnitude that overwhelms the query results, because the kurtosis
and skewness of the nondeterministic accuracy loss introduced by R1SMG is
larger than that introduced by other mechanisms.

often described in the literature within two approaches: i) the coupled
channels model accounting for structure of the colliding nuclei and ii)
trajectory models with friction and thermal fluctuations (dissipative effects).
The first approach does not account for friction whereas the second one is not
able to deal with sub-barrier CSs. In the present work, we have developed an
algorithm for calculating the capture CSs of collision of spherical nuclei
accounting for both zero-point oscillations (ZPO) of the nuclear shapes
(structure effects) and for dissipative effects; i.e., in a sense we have
combined the above two approaches. The bare nucleus-nucleus potential is
evaluated using the semi-microscopic double-folding model with M3Y-Paris
nucleon-nucleon forces. The nucleon densities are taken from the IAEA data
base. For each collision partner several deformations of quadrupole and
octupole type are accounted for with the probabilities corresponding to the
harmonic oscillator at the ground state. The dissipative effects enter into our
combined approach within the surface friction model well known in the
literature. The final fate of a trajectory is decided by means of quantum
transmission coefficients. There are two fitting parameters in the model, tau
and K_R. Parameter tau reflects to what extent ZPO survives when the reagents
approach each other. Parameter K_R is the friction strength for the radial
motion. All calculations have been performed for 16O+92Zr reaction. The
calculated CSs and barrier distribution are found in good agreement with the
precision experimental data at reasonable values of tau and K_R. Calculations
show that the CSs are mostly sensitive to tau at low (sub-barrier) collision
energies whereas the value of K_R is important at the above barrier energies.

proposed for nonlinear degenerate interface problems. The scheme combines deep
neural network on the singular subdomain with finite difference method on the
regular subdomain. The key of the new approach is to split nonlinear degenerate
partial differential equation with interface into two independent boundary
value problems based on deep learning. The outstanding advantages of the
proposed schemes are that not only the convergence order of the degenerate
interface problems on whole domain is determined by the finite difference
scheme on the regular subdomain, but also can calculate $\mathbf{VERY}$

performance and analyze the cost, it is indispensable to model the training
throughput of distributed DNN training. However, complex parallelization
strategies and the resulting complex runtime behaviors make it challenging to
construct an accurate performance model. In this paper, we present Proteus, the
first standalone simulator to model the performance of complex parallelization
strategies through simulation execution. Proteus first models complex
parallelization strategies with a unified representation named Strategy Tree.
Then, it compiles the strategy tree into a distributed execution graph and
simulates the complex runtime behaviors, comp-comm overlap and bandwidth
sharing, with a Hierarchical Topo-Aware Executor (HTAE). We finally evaluate
Proteus across a wide variety of DNNs on three hardware configurations.
Experimental results show that Proteus achieves $3.0\%$ average prediction
error and preserves order for training throughput of various parallelization
strategies. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, Proteus reduces prediction
error by up to $133.8\%$.

has been observed that low-quality pseudo-labels severely limit the performance
of SSOD. In this paper, we examine the root causes of low-quality pseudo-labels
and present novel learning mechanisms to improve the label generation quality.
To cope with high false-negative and low precision rates, we introduce an
adaptive thresholding mechanism that helps the proposed network to filter out
optimal bounding boxes. We further introduce a Jitter-Bagging module to provide
accurate information on localization to help refine the bounding boxes.
Additionally, two new losses are introduced using the background and foreground
scores predicted by the teacher and student networks to improvise the
pseudo-label recall rate. Furthermore, our method applies strict supervision to
the teacher network by feeding strong & weak augmented data to generate robust
pseudo-labels so that it can detect small and complex objects. Finally, the
extensive experiments show that the proposed network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets and allows the
baseline network to achieve 100% supervised performance with much less (i.e.,
20%) labeled data.

subspaces. Subspace methods, such as Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC) and
Root-MUSIC, rely on several restrictive assumptions, including narrowband
non-coherent sources and fully calibrated arrays, and their performance is
considerably degraded when these do not hold. In this work we propose
SubspaceNet; a data-driven DoA estimator which learns how to divide the
observations into distinguishable subspaces. This is achieved by utilizing a
dedicated deep neural network to learn the empirical autocorrelation of the
input, by training it as part of the Root-MUSIC method, leveraging the inherent
differentiability of this specific DoA estimator, while removing the need to
provide a ground-truth decomposable autocorrelation matrix. Once trained, the
resulting SubspaceNet serves as a universal surrogate covariance estimator that
can be applied in combination with any subspace-based DoA estimation method,
allowing its successful application in challenging setups. SubspaceNet is shown
to enable various DoA estimation algorithms to cope with coherent sources,

task that enables object detection with the ability to detect unknown objects.
Existing methods typically estimate the object likelihood with an additional

training objective. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective
learning strategy, namely Decoupled Objectness Learning (DOL), which divides
the learning of these two boundaries into suitable decoder layers. Moreover,
detecting unknown objects comprehensively requires a large amount of
annotations, but labeling all unknown objects is both difficult and expensive.
Therefore, we propose to take advantage of the recent Large Vision Model (LVM),
specifically the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to enhance the detection of
unknown objects. Nevertheless, the output results of SAM contain noise,
including backgrounds and fragments, so we introduce an Auxiliary Supervision

Consequently, they usually achieve degraded performance for low-resolution face

Each agent needs to select one of available strategies to take on one or more
tasks. Since each strategy allows an agent to perform multiple tasks at a time,
possibly at distinct rates, the strategy selection of the agents need to be
coordinated. The main objective of this work is to design a decentralized
decision-making model that coordinates the agents in selecting strategies and
allows them to asymptotically adopt the optimal strategies, e.g., the
strategies that minimize remaining jobs in all assigned tasks.
  We formulate the problem using the population game formalism and refer to it

As key contributions, we propose a method to find a payoff-driven

perceived benefits and drawbacks of using a mobile app that allows them to
co-manage mobile privacy, safety, and security within their families. While the
primary goal of the study was to understand the use case as it pertained to
parents and teens, an emerging finding from our study was that participants
found value in extending app use to other family members (siblings, cousins,
and grandparents). Participants felt that it would help bring the necessary
expertise into their immediate family network and help protect the older adults
and children of the family from privacy and security risks. However,
participants expressed that co-monitoring by extended family members might
cause tensions in their families, creating interpersonal conflicts. To
alleviate these concerns, participants suggested more control over the privacy
features to facilitate sharing their installed apps with only trusted family
members.

  Perturbations",,,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The capacity of information delivered by single photons is boosted by
encoding high-dimensional quantum dits in their transverse shape. Transporting
such high-dimensional quantum dits in optical networks may be accomplished
using multimode optical fibers, which support the low-loss transmission of
multiple spatial modes over existing infrastructure. However, when photons
propagate through a multimode fiber their transverse shape gets scrambled
because of mode mixing and modal interference. This is usually corrected using
free-space spatial light modulators, inhibiting a robust all-fiber operation.
In this work, we demonstrate an all-fiber approach for controlling the shape of
single photons and the spatial correlations between entangled photon pairs,
using carefully controlled mechanical perturbations of the fiber. We optimize
these perturbations to localize the spatial distribution of a single photon or
the spatial correlations of photon pairs in a single spot, enhancing the signal
in the optimized spot by over an order of magnitude. Using the same approach we
show a similar enhancement for coupling light from a multimode fiber into a
single-mode fiber.

stars while focusing on G-type dwarfs using entire Kepler data to study
statistical properties of the occurrence rate of super-flares. Using these new
data, as a by-product, we found fourteen cases of super-flare detection on
thirteen slowly rotating Sun-like stars with rotation periods of 24.5 to 44
days. This result supports earlier conclusion by others that the Sun may
possibly have a surprise super-flare. Moreover, we found twelve and seven new
cases of detection of exceptionally large amplitude super-flares on six and
four main-sequence stars of G- and M-type, respectively. No large-amplitude
flares were detected in A, F, or K main-sequence stars. Here we present
preliminary analysis of these cases. The super-flare detection, i.e. an
estimation of flare energy, is based on a more accurate method compared to
previous studies. We fit an exponential decay function to flare light curves
and study the relation between e-folding decay time, $\tau$, vs. flare
amplitude and flare energy. We find that for slowly rotating Sun-like stars,
large values of $\tau$ correspond to small flare energies and small values of
$\tau$ correspond to high flare energies considered. Similarly, $\tau$ is large
for small flare amplitudes and $\tau$ is small for large amplitudes considered.
However, there is no clear relation between these parameters for large
amplitude super-flares in the main sequence G- and M-type stars, as we could
not establish clear functional dependence between the parameters via standard
fitting algorithms.

networks, which is a well-known $NP$-hard problem. Coflow is a relatively new
network abstraction used to characterize communication patterns in data
centers. We consider both flow-level scheduling and coflow-level scheduling
problems. In the flow-level scheduling problem, flows within a coflow can be
transmitted through different network cores. However, in the coflow-level
scheduling problem, flows within a coflow must be transmitted through the same
network core. The key difference between these two problems lies in their
scheduling granularity. Previous approaches relied on linear programming to
solve the scheduling order. In this paper, we enhance the efficiency of solving
by utilizing the primal-dual method. For the flow-level scheduling problem, we
propose a $(6-\frac{2}{m})$-approximation algorithm with arbitrary release
times and a $(5-\frac{2}{m})$-approximation algorithm without release time,
where $m$ represents the number of network cores. Additionally, for the
coflow-level scheduling problem, we introduce a $(4m+1)$-approximation

without release time. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms,
we conduct simulations using both synthetic and real traffic traces. The
results demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithms compared to

dynamical systems, enables thorough formal analyses. We focus specifically on a
family of networks dubbed Large Kernel Convolutional Neural Networks (LKCNN),

that LKCNNs use qualitative properties of the input sequence. In particular, we
show that the relation between input periodicity and activation periodicity is
key for the performance of LKCNN models. Low performing models show, in fact,
analogous periodic activations to random untrained models. This could give very

signals and seem to have a limited ability to cope with noisy. In this paper, a
linear self-supervised reconstruction task was designed for extracting the
inherent self-similar prior in physiological signals. Besides, a specific
noise-insensitive strategy was explored for reducing the interference of motion

demonstrates excellent performance even on the challenging VIPL-HR dataset. We

systems, featuring a characteristic size $L(t)$ and a propagation velocity
$c_{\rm p}(t)$ ($t$ is time). Here, we develop a theory of slip pulses in
realistic rate-and-state dependent frictional systems. We show that slip pulses
are intrinsically unsteady objects, yet their dynamical evolution is closely
related to their unstable steady-state counterparts. In particular, we show
that each point along the time-independent $L^{\mbox{{(0)}}}\!(\tau_{\rm
d})\!-\!c^{\mbox{{(0)}}}_{\rm p}\!(\tau_{\rm d})$ line, obtained from a family
of steady-state pulse solutions parameterized by the driving shear stress
$\tau_{\rm d}$, is unstable. Nevertheless, and remarkably, the
$c^{\mbox{{(0)}}}_{\rm p}[L^{\mbox{{(0)}}}]$ line is a dynamic attractor such
that the unsteady dynamics of slip pulses -- whether growing
($\dot{L}(t)\!>\!0$) or decaying ($\dot{L}(t)\!<\!0$) -- reside on the
steady-state line. The unsteady dynamics along the line are controlled by a
single slow unstable mode. The slow dynamics of growing pulses, manifested by
$\dot{L}(t)/c_{\rm p}(t)\!\ll\!1$, explain the existence of sustained pulses,
i.e.~pulses that propagate many times their characteristic size without
appreciably changing their properties. Our theoretical picture of unsteady
frictional slip pulses is quantitatively supported by large-scale, dynamic
boundary-integral method simulations.

still require (post-)processing to yield satisfactory explanatory insights.

In this work, we demonstrate a robust recipe for efficient generation of
circularly-polarized harmonics with the same helicity. For this purpose, a
nontrivial tailored driving field, consisting of two co-rotating laser pulses
with frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$, is utilized to generate harmonics from
graphene. The Lissajous figure of the total driving pulse exhibits an absence
of the rotational symmetry, which imposes no constraint on the helicity of the

with the same helicity is robust against various perturbations in the setup,
such as variation in the subcycle phase difference or the intensity ratio of
the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ pulses, as rotational symmetry of the total driving
pulse remains absent. Our approach is expected to be equally applicable to
other two-dimensional materials, among others, transition-metal dichalcogenides

common practice is to select the highly confident predictions as the

classes, however, it should be confident about the pixel not belonging to the
remaining classes. Hence, such a pixel can be convincingly treated as a
negative key to those most unlikely categories. Therefore, we develop an
effective pipeline to make sufficient use of unlabeled data. Concretely, we
separate reliable and unreliable pixels via the entropy of predictions, push
each unreliable pixel to a category-wise queue that consists of negative keys,
and manage to train the model with all candidate pixels. Considering the

of identifying the root cause of the fault by narrowing down the space of
likely fault locations. Simulating variants of the faulty program called
mutants, several Mutation Based Fault Localisation (MBFL) techniques have been
proposed to automatically locate faults. Despite their success, existing MBFL
techniques suffer from the cost of performing mutation analysis after the fault
is observed. Method: To overcome this shortcoming, we propose a new MBFL
technique named SIMFL (Statistical Inference for Mutation-based Fault
Localisation). SIMFL localises faults based on the past results of mutation
analysis that has been done on the earlier version in the project history,
allowing developers to make predictions on the location of incoming faults in a
just-in-time manner. Using several statistical inference methods, SIMFL models
the relationship between test results of the mutants and their locations, and
subsequently infers the location of the current faults. Results: The empirical
study on Defects4J dataset shows that SIMFL can localise 113 faults on the
first rank out of 224 faults, outperforming other MBFL techniques. Even when
SIMFL is trained on the predicted kill matrix, SIMFL can still localise 95
faults on the first rank out of 194 faults. Moreover, removing redundant
mutants significantly improves the localisation accuracy of SIMFL by the number
of faults localised at the first rank up to 51. Conclusion: This paper proposes
a new MBFL technique called SIMFL, which exploits ahead-of-time mutation
analysis to localise current faults. SIMFL is not only cost-effective, as it
does not need a mutation analysis after the fault is observed, but also capable
of localising faults accurately.

Nevertheless, when a PLM's scale grows up to tens of billions of parameters,
all PET methods achieve almost the same performance and even perform on par
with the full-parameter fine-tuning method. Hence, we hypothesize that model
scaling can mitigate the design differences (the module structures and the
number of trainable parameters) among PET methods. To study this hypothesis, we
introduce a more flexible PET method - arbitrary PET (APET) method - to be
compatible with arbitrary module structures and any number of trainable
parameters. Then, we experiment on $11$ NLP tasks of $5$ types and $2$
representative PLMs. From our investigations, we find that the model scaling
(1) mitigates the effects of the arbitrary module structure on the performance
of tuning methods, and (2) enables the tuning methods to optimize fewer
parameters to achieve the full-parameter fine-tuning performance. Intriguingly,
we also observe that all tuning methods require almost the same number of
trainable parameters to drive PLMs. We discuss this phenomenon and the above
two findings collectively from optimization perspectives to fathom the
mechanisms behind them. These conclusions not only demonstrate the positive
impact of model scaling on tuning methods but disclose its mechanisms, which
help us design more effective and efficient tuning methods on larger-scale

This is generally attributed to an alignment of the update of the random walker

To fill this gap, we find that convolution, a traditional technique but

respectively capturing the cross-time and cross-variable dependency. Based on
this finding, we propose a modern pure convolution structure, namely
Cross-LKTCN, to better utilize both cross-time and cross-variable dependency

depth-wise large kernel convolution with large receptive field is proposed to
capture cross-time dependency, and then two successive point-wise group
convolution feed forward networks are proposed to capture cross-variable

Nevertheless, tradition dictates that an enigmatic 'invisible hand' governs

testable energy cost theories of economic valuation, and have shown the gross
correlation between energy consumption and economic output at the national
level through input-output energy analysis. However, due to the difficulty of
precise energy analysis and highly complicated real markets, no decisive
evidence directly linking energy costs to the selling prices of individual
commodities has yet been found. Over the past century, the US metal market has
accumulated a huge body of price data, which for the first time ever provides
us the opportunity to quantitatively examine the direct energy-value
correlation. Here, by analyzing the market price data of 65 purified chemical
elements (mainly metals) relative to the total energy consumption for refining
them from naturally occurring geochemical conditions, we found a clear
correlation between the energy cost and their market prices. The underlying
physics we proposed has compatibility with conventional economic concepts such
as the ratio between supply and demand or scarcity's role in economic

controlling the temporal features of the electron pulses. One promising
suggestion is the nano-selective driving of quantum optics with
multi-electrons, which can occur if laser-structured consecutive electrons are
bunched within the decoherence time of the quantum system. Compressing electron
pulses with terahertz (THz) radiation formed in optical nonlinear crystals is
an attractive methodology to generate the rapidly varying electric fields
necessary for electron compression, with an inherent temporal locking to
laser-triggered electrons. Sub-THz are especially appealing as they can
compress longer (picosecond-) pulses, however, the generation of such low
frequencies is inefficient and their focusability is fundamentally limited by
diffraction. This work proposes electron-pulse compression with sub-THz fields
directly in the vicinity of their dipolar origin, thereby avoiding their
mediation through radiation. We analyze the merits of such nearfields for
electron compression and find that it is particularly advantageous for small
numerical apertures and micro-joule-level optical pulses, and hence can be
implemented within the tight constraints of standard electron microscopes and
work at high repetition rates. We target temporal compression within low-eV
electron microscopes but the new paradigm we suggest offers a realistic
approach for controlling electron pulses spatially and temporally in many
experiments, opening the path of flexible multi-electron manipulation for

political opinion, the lack of diversity can lead to lawsuits.
  In this work, we focus on the problem of finding a densest diverse subgraph
in a graph whose nodes have different attribute values/types that we refer to
as colors. We propose two novel formulations motivated by different realistic
scenarios. Our first formulation, called the densest diverse subgraph problem
(DDSP), guarantees that no color represents more than some fraction of the
nodes in the output subgraph, which generalizes the state-of-the-art due to
Anagnostopoulos et al. (CIKM 2020). By varying the fraction we can range the
diversity constraint and interpolate from a diverse dense subgraph where all
colors have to be equally represented to an unconstrained dense subgraph. We
design a scalable $\Omega(1/\sqrt{n})$-approximation algorithm, where $n$ is
the number of nodes. Our second formulation is motivated by the setting where
any specified color should not be overlooked. We propose the densest
at-least-$\vec{k}$-subgraph problem (Dal$\vec{k}$S), a novel generalization of
the classic Dal$k$S, where instead of a single value $k$, we have a vector
${\mathbf k}$ of cardinality demands with one coordinate per color class. We
design a $1/3$-approximation algorithm using linear programming together with
an acceleration technique. Computational experiments using synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed algorithms are effective in
extracting dense diverse clusters.

in \cite{Fo1,Fo3}, when the flow is minimal over the entire surface and the
function $f$ satisfies some Sobolev regularity conditions. We deal with the
flow restricted to any its minimal component and any smooth function $f$
whenever the flow satisfies the Full Filtration Diophantine Condition (FFDC)
(this is a full measure condition). The main goal of this article is to
quantify optimal regularity of solutions. For this purpose we construct a
family of invariant distributions $\mathfrak{F}_{\bar t}$,
$\bar{t}\in\mathscr{TF}^*$ that play the roles of the Forni's invariant
distributions introduced in \cite{Fo1,Fo3} by using the language of translation

images restored by the model, it can significantly improve the perceptual
quality and/or the MSE of the model for newly restored images without further
training. Our approach is motivated by a recent theoretical result that links
between the minimum MSE (MMSE) predictor and the predictor that minimizes the
MSE under a perfect perceptual quality constraint. Specifically, it has been
shown that the latter can be obtained by optimally transporting the output of
the former, such that its distribution matches the source data. Thus, to
improve the perceptual quality of a predictor that was originally trained to
minimize MSE, we approximate the optimal transport by a linear transformation
in the latent space of a variational auto-encoder, which we compute in
closed-form using empirical means and covariances. Going beyond the theory, we
find that applying the same procedure on models that were initially trained to
achieve high perceptual quality, typically improves their perceptual quality
even further. And by interpolating the results with the original output of the
model, we can improve their MSE on the expense of perceptual quality. We
illustrate our method on a variety of degradations applied to general content

omnipresent temperatures as the input-output mechanical bits, which consists of
a metamaterial thermal channel as the gate terminal driving a nonlinear
bistable soft actuator to selectively connect the output terminal to two other

can establish a universal processing core comprising an arithmetic circuit and
a register in a compact, reprogrammable network involving periodic read, write,

realizing a non-electric universal mechanical computing architecture that

fault diagnosis has gained attention as it aims to diagnose both seen and
unseen faults. Nevertheless, the lack of unseen fault data for training poses a
challenging domain shift problem (DSP), where unseen faults are often
identified as seen faults. In this article, we propose a knowledge space
sharing (KSS) model to address the DSP in the generalized zero-shot industrial
fault diagnosis task. The KSS model includes a generation mechanism (KSS-G) and
a discrimination mechanism (KSS-D). KSS-G generates samples for rare faults by
recombining transferable attribute features extracted from seen samples under
the guidance of auxiliary knowledge. KSS-D is trained in a supervised way with
the help of generated samples, which aims to address the DSP by modeling seen
categories in the knowledge space. KSS-D avoids misclassifying rare faults as
seen faults and identifies seen fault samples. We conduct generalized zero-shot

  Language Models for Passage Retrieval","10 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Passage retrieval is a fundamental task in many information systems, such as
web search and question answering, where both efficiency and effectiveness are
critical concerns. In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained
language models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet,
studies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due
to the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate
passages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to
improve the performance of vanilla dual-encoders. Particularly, recent
state-of-the-art methods often introduce late-interaction during the model
inference process. However, such late-interaction based methods usually bring
extensive computation and storage cost on large corpus. Despite their
effectiveness, the concern of efficiency and space footprint is still an
important factor that limits the application of interaction-based neural
retrieval models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate implicit interaction
into dual-encoders, and propose I^3 retriever. In particular, our implicit
interaction paradigm leverages generated pseudo-queries to simulate
query-passage interaction, which jointly optimizes with query and passage
encoders in an end-to-end manner. It can be fully pre-computed and cached, and
its inference process only involves simple dot product operation of the query
vector and passage vector, which makes it as efficient as the vanilla dual
encoders. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC2019 Deep
Learning Datasets, demonstrating the I^3 retriever's superiority in terms of
both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, the proposed implicit interaction
is compatible with special pre-training and knowledge distillation for passage
retrieval, which brings a new state-of-the-art performance.

and chemical information, within 4.5 $\leq$ $R$ $\leq$ 15.0 kpc and $|Z|$

stars are accurately described as $\alpha$ = $\alpha_{0}$ $\mathrm{arctan}$
($Z$/$R$) with $\alpha_{0}$ = (0.68 $\pm$ 0.05). This indicates the alignment
of velocity ellipsoids is between cylindrical and spherical, implying that any
deviation from the spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoids may be caused
by the gravitational potential of the baryonic disk. The results of various
populations suggest that the $\alpha_{0}$ displays an age and population
dependence, with the thin and thick disks respectively values $\alpha_{0}$ =
(0.72 $\pm$ 0.08) and $\alpha_{0}$ = (0.64 $\pm$ 0.07), and the $\alpha_{0}$
displays a decreasing trend with age (and [$\alpha$/Fe]) increases, meaning
that the velocity ellipsoids of the kinematically relaxed stars are mainly
dominated by the gravitational potential of the baryonic disk. We determine the
$\alpha_{0} - R$ for various populations, finding that the $\alpha_{0}$
displays oscillations with $R$ for all the different populations. The
oscillations in $\alpha_{0}$ appear in both kinematically hot and cold

likely origin for these oscillations.

considered using the orbital mapping method. It is demonstrated that when mode
damping is negligible the mode amplitude will generically grow in time for all
values of orbital eccentricity and semi-major axis, even for small kicks
outside the regime exhibiting diffusive growth. The origin of the small-kick
growth is the change in kick size from orbit to orbit, an effect quadratic in
the mode amplitude. When damping of the mode is included, the growth is shut
off when the damping time is shorter than the growth time. Hence, in practice,
kicks of sufficient size and long mode damping times are required for
interesting levels of growth to occur. Application to the circularization of
hot Jupiters is discussed. Previous investigations found that diffusive growth
of the planetary f-mode in the large-kick regime would lead to rapid orbital
shrinkage, but upon exiting the diffusive regime at $e \sim 0.9$ the theory
would predict a large population of highly eccentric orbits. Simulations
presented here show that subsequent orbital evolution relying on the small-kick

less than the Gyrs ages of these systems.

focuses on a challenging issue in MVC called the incomplete continual data

available in advance and overlook the scenarios where data observations of
views are accumulated over time. Due to privacy considerations or memory
limitations, previous views cannot be stored in these situations. Some works
are proposed to handle it, but all fail to address incomplete views. Such an
incomplete continual data problem (ICDP) in MVC is tough to solve since
incomplete information with continual data increases the difficulty of
extracting consistent and complementary knowledge among views. We propose Fast
Continual Multi-View Clustering with Incomplete Views (FCMVC-IV) to address it.
Specifically, it maintains a consensus coefficient matrix and updates knowledge
with the incoming incomplete view rather than storing and recomputing all the
data matrices. Considering that the views are incomplete, the newly collected
view might contain samples that have yet to appear; two indicator matrices and
a rotation matrix are developed to match matrices with different dimensions.
Besides, we design a three-step iterative algorithm to solve the resultant
problem in linear complexity with proven convergence. Comprehensive experiments

its stochastic optimization succeeds. We suggest this is due to a theoretical
gap in existing stochastic optimization proofs-namely the challenge of gradient
estimators with unusual noise bounds, and a composite non-smooth objective. For
dense Gaussian variational families, we observe that existing gradient
estimators based on reparameterization satisfy a quadratic noise bound and give
novel convergence guarantees for proximal and projected stochastic gradient
descent using this bound. This provides the first rigorous guarantee that
black-box variational inference converges for realistic inference problems.

external regions of a simulated cluster of galaxy at high resolution, including
the effect of radiative losses and turbulent re-acceleration acting on
relativistic electrons. We conclude that turbulent re-acceleration is enough
prolonged in time to produce a large reservoir of radio emitting electrons in
the large regions illuminated by Mega Radiohalos observed by LOFAR.

significant threats to the LEO operation satellites. An Active Debris Removal
$(ADR)$ concept continuously evolves for space junk removal. One of the ADR
methods is Space Robotics, whose function is to chase, capture and de-orbit the
space junk. This paper presents the development of an on-ground space robotics
facility in the TCS Research for on-orbit servicing $(OOS)$ like refueling and
debris capture experiments. A Hardware in Loop Simulation (HILS) system will be
used for integrated system development, testing, and demonstration of on-orbit
docking mechanisms. The HiLS test facility of TCS Research Lab will use two URs
in which one UR is attached to the RG2 gripper, and the other is attached to a
force-torque sensor and with a scaled mock-up model. The first UR5 will be
mounted on a 7-axis linear rail and contain the docking probe. First, UR5 with
a suitable gripper has to interface its control boxes. The grasping algorithm
was run through the ROS interface line to demonstrate and validate the on-orbit
operations. The manipulator will be mounted with LIDAR and a camera to
visualize the mock-up model, find the target model's pose and rotational
velocity estimation, and a gripper that will move relative to the target model.
The other manipulator has the UR10 control, providing rotational and random
motion to the mockup, enabling a dynamic simulator fed by force-torque data.
The dynamic simulator is fed up with the orbit propagator, which will provide
the orbiting environment to the target model. For the simulation of the docking
and grasping of the target model, a linear rail of a 6m setup is still in the
procurement process. Once reaching proximity, the grasping algorithm will be
launched to capture the target model after reading the random motion of the
mock-up model.

  Unsupervised Learning Setup","12 pages, The paper is under review",,,,"eess.SY cs.LG cs.SY eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a
model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. In the article, we
propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE
provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given
linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form
posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used
in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends
on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior
of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN
captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The
training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using
an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to
a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but
we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not
have access to state information in the training data and can not use
supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models
(Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised
learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the
process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive
performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF),
extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), and a recently proposed hybrid method
called KalmanNet.

  Auto-Encoder",,,,,"cs.CV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video anomaly detection has great potential in enhancing safety in the
production and monitoring of crucial areas. Currently, most video anomaly
detection methods are based on RGB modality, but its redundant semantic
information may breach the privacy of residents or patients. The 3D data
obtained by depth camera and LiDAR can accurately locate anomalous events in 3D
space while preserving human posture and motion information. Identifying
individuals through the point cloud is difficult due to its sparsity, which
protects personal privacy. In this study, we propose Point Spatio-Temporal
Auto-Encoder (PSTAE), an autoencoder framework that uses point cloud videos as
input to detect anomalies in point cloud videos. We introduce PSTOp and
PSTTransOp to maintain spatial geometric and temporal motion information in
point cloud videos. To measure the reconstruction loss of the proposed
autoencoder framework, we propose a reconstruction loss measurement strategy
based on a shallow feature extractor. Experimental results on the TIMo dataset
show that our method outperforms currently representative depth modality-based
methods in terms of AUROC and has superior performance in detecting Medical
Issue anomalies. These results suggest the potential of point cloud modality in
video anomaly detection. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the
TIMo dataset.

replacing traditional systems and platforms that are driven by digital circuits
and modular software -- with hardware and software that operates on the
principle of quantum mechanics. QCs that rely on quantum mechanics can exploit
quantum circuits (i.e., quantum bits for manipulating quantum gates) to achieve
""quantum computational supremacy"" over traditional, i.e., digital computing
systems. Currently, the issues that impede mass-scale adoption of quantum
systems are rooted in the fact that building, maintaining, and/or programming
QCs is a complex and radically distinct engineering paradigm when compared to
challenges of classical computing and software engineering. Quantum service
orientation is seen as a solution that synergises the research on service
computing and quantum software engineering (QSE) to allow developers and users
to build and utilise quantum software services based on pay-per-shot utility
computing model. The pay-per-shot model represents a single execution of
instruction on quantum processing unit and it allows vendors (e.g., Amazon
Braket) to offer their QC platforms, simulators, software services etc. to
enterprises and individuals who do not need to own or maintain quantum systems.
This research contributes by 1) developing a reference architecture for
enabling quantum computing as a service, 2) implementing microservices with the
quantum-classic split pattern as an architectural use-case, and 3) evaluating
the reference architecture based on feedback by 22 practitioners. In the QSE
context, the research focuses on unifying architectural methods and
service-orientation patterns to promote reuse knowledge and best practices to
tackle emerging and futuristic challenges of architecting and implementing
Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS).

that have captivated mathematicians, scientists, and artists across centuries.
Its intriguing nature lies in its profound connection to the golden ratio, as
well as its prevalence in the natural world, exhibited through phenomena such
as spiral galaxies, plant seeds, the arrangement of petals, and branching
structures. This report delves into the fundamental characteristics of the FS,
explores its relationship with the golden ratio using Linear Time Invariant
(LTI) systems, and investigates its diverse applications in various fields.
Approaching the topic from the standpoint of a digital signal processing
instructor in a grade course, we depict the FS as the consequential outcome of
an LTI system when subjected to the unit impulse function. This LTI system can
be regarded as the original source from which one of the most renowned formulas
in mathematics emerges, and its parametric definition, along with the
associated systems, is intricately tied to the golden ratio, symbolized by the
irrational number Phi. This perspective naturally elucidates the
well-established intricate relationship between the FS and Phi. Furthermore,
building upon this perspective, we showcase other LTI systems that exhibit the
same magnitude in the frequency domain. These systems are characterized by
either an impulse response or a difference equation, resulting in a comparable
or equivalent FS in terms of absolute value. By exploring these connections, we
shed light on the remarkable similarities and variations that arise within the
FS under different LTI systems.

interesting challenges to tackle, such as limited field view of the cameras and
a relatively closed and small environment. The pipeline consists of training a
2D markerless pose estimation model to work on every viewpoint, then applying
it to the videos and performing triangulation. We present numerical evaluation
of the results (error analysis), as well as show the utility of the achieved
poses in downstream tasks of selected behavioral predictions. Our analysis of
the predictive model for equine behavior showed a bias towards pain-induced
horses, which aligns with our understanding of how behavior varies across

scheme for large-scale integration of superconducting qubits. The key feature
of the scheme is the insertion of connecting pads between qubit and tunable
coupling element. In such a way, the distance between two qubits can be
increased considerably to a few millimeters, leaving enough space for arranging
control lines, readout resonators and other necessary structures. The increased
inter-qubit distance provides more wiring space for flip-chip process and
reduces crosstalk between qubits and from control lines to qubits. We use the
term Tunable Coupler with Capacitively Connecting Pad (TCCP) to name the
tunable coupling part that consists of a transmon coupler and capacitively
connecting pads. With the different placement of connecting pads, different
TCCP architectures can be realized. We have designed and fabricated a few
multi-qubit devices in which TCCP is used for coupling. The measured results
show that the performance of the qubits coupled by the TCCP, such as $T_1$ and
$T_2$, was similar to that of the traditional transmon qubits without TCCP.
Meanwhile, our TCCP also exhibited a wide tunable range of the effective
coupling strength and a low residual ZZ interaction between the qubits by
properly tuning the parameters on the design. Finally, we successfully
implemented an adiabatic CZ gate with TCCP. Furthermore, by introducing TCCP,
we also discuss the realization of the flip-chip process and tunable coupling
qubits between different chips.

collective spins. These large spins are then coupled with XXZ anisotropic
interactions along a third direction of the lattice. This system can be
realized via superexchange interactions in a 3D optical lattice subject to an
external linear potential, such as gravity, and in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) to generate spin anisotropic interactions. We show there is a
wide range of parameters in this setting where the spin squeezing improves with

large dimensions, and in some experiments, such high dimensional data arrive
sequentially rather than full data being available all at a time. We develop
multiple testing procedures with simultaneous control of false discovery and
nondiscovery rates when $m$-variate data vectors $\mathbf{X}_1, \mathbf{X}_2,
\dots$ are observed sequentially or in groups and each coordinate of these
vectors leads to a hypothesis testing. Existing multiple testing methods for
sequential data uses fixed stopping boundaries that do not depend on sample
size, and hence, are quite conservative when the number of hypotheses $m$ is
large. We propose sequential tests based on adaptive stopping boundaries that
ensure shrinkage of the continue sampling region as the sample size increases.
Under minimal assumptions on the data sequence, we first develop a test based
on an oracle test statistic such that both false discovery rate (FDR) and false
nondiscovery rate (FNR) are nearly equal to some prefixed levels with strong
control. Under a two-group mixture model assumption, we propose a data-driven
stopping and decision rule based on local false discovery rate statistic that
mimics the oracle rule and guarantees simultaneous control of FDR and FNR
asymptotically as $m$ tends to infinity. Both the oracle and the data-driven
stopping times are shown to be finite (i.e., proper) with probability 1 for all
finite $m$ and converge to a finite constant as $m$ grows to infinity. Further,
we compare the data-driven test with the existing gap rule proposed in He and
Bartroff (2021) and show that the ratio of the expected sample sizes of our
method and the gap rule tends to zero as $m$ goes to infinity. Extensive
analysis of simulated datasets as well as some real datasets illustrate the
superiority of the proposed tests over some existing methods.

subcellular cytoskeletal remodelling, through tissue development in
embryogenesis, to population-level bacterial colonies expansion. In each of
these, biological functionality requires collective flows to occur while
self-organized structures are protected; however, the mechanisms by which
active flows can spontaneously constrain their dynamics to preserve structure
have not previously been explained. By studying collective flows and defect
dynamics in active nematic films, we demonstrate the existence of a
self-constraint -- a two-way, spontaneously arising relationship between
activity-driven isosurfaces of flow boundaries and mesoscale nematic
structures. Our results show that self-motile defects are tightly constrained
to viscometric surfaces -- contours along which vorticity and strain-rate
balance. This in turn reveals that self-motile defects break mirror symmetry
when they move along a single viscometric surface, in contrast with
expectations. This is explained by an interdependence between viscometric
surfaces and bend walls -- elongated narrow kinks in the orientation field.
Although we focus on extensile nematic films, numerical results show the
constraint holds whenever activity leads to motile half-charge defects. This
mesoscale cross-field self-constraint offers a new framework for tackling
complex 3D active turbulence, designing dynamic control into biomimetic
materials, and understanding how biological systems can employ active stress
for dynamic self-organization.

the Poisson equation in the PLUTO code for astrophysical fluid dynamics. Our
solver relies on a relaxation method in which convergence is sought as the
steady-state solution of a parabolic equation, whose time-discretization is
governed by the \textit{Runge-Kutta-Legendre} (RKL) method. Our findings
indicate that the RKL-based Poisson solver, which is both fully parallel and
rapidly convergent, has the potential to serve as a practical alternative to
conventional iterative solvers such as the \textit{Gauss-Seidel} (GS) and
\textit{successive over-relaxation} (SOR) methods. Additionally, it can
mitigate some of the drawbacks of these traditional techniques. We incorporate
our algorithm into a multigrid solver to provide a simple and efficient gravity
solver that can be used to obtain the gravitational potentials in
self-gravitational hydrodynamics. We test our implementation against a broad
range of standard self-gravitating astrophysical problems designed to examine
different aspects of the code. We demonstrate that the results match
excellently with the analytical predictions (when available), and the findings
of similar previous studies.

missing energy ($\slashed E$) can serve as potentially promising hunting
grounds for hints of new physics, as the standard-model backgrounds are very
suppressed. A few of such processes have been searched for in recent
experiments, particularly $D^0\to\slashed E$ by Belle and $D^0\to\pi^0\slashed
E$ and $\Lambda_c^+\to p\slashed E$ by BESIII, resulting in upper bounds on
their branching fractions. We consider them to illuminate the possible
contributions of the quark transition $c\to u\slashed E$ with a couple of
invisible spinless bosons carrying away the missing energy, assuming that they
are not charge conjugates of each other and hence can have unequal masses. We
find that these data are complementary in that they constrain different sets of
the underlying operators and do not cover the same ranges of the bosons'
masses, but there are regions not yet accessible. From the allowed parameter
space, we show that other $D$-meson decays, such as $D\to\rho\slashed E$, and
the charmed-baryon ones $\Xi_c\to(\Sigma,\Lambda)\slashed E$ can have sizable
branching fractions and therefore may offer further probes of the new-physics
interactions. We point out the importance of $D^0\to\gamma\slashed E$ which are
not yet searched for but could access parts of the parameter space beyond the
reach of the other modes. In addition, we look at a scenario where the
invisibles are instead fermionic, namely sterile neutrinos, and a scalar
leptoquark mediates $c\to u\slashed E$. We discuss the implications of the
aforesaid bounds for this model. The predictions we make for the various
charmed-hadron decays in the different scenarios may be testable in the near
future by BESIII and Belle II.

concept that is not directly measurable. Aim: This study intends to identify,

empirical software engineering literature and use the findings to suggest ways
to improve the reporting of construct validity issues. Method: We analyzed 83
articles that report human-centric experiments published in five top-tier
software engineering journals from 2015 to 2019. The articles' text concerning
threats to construct validity was divided into segments (the unit of analysis)
based on predefined categories. The segments were then evaluated regarding
whether they clearly discussed a threat and a construct. Results: Three-fifths
of the segments were associated with topics not related to construct validity.
Two-thirds of the articles discussed construct validity without using the
definition of construct validity given in the article. The threats were clearly
described in more than four-fifths of the segments, but the construct in
question was clearly described in only two-thirds of the segments. The
construct was unclear when the discussion was not related to construct validity
but to other types of validity. Conclusions: The results show potential for
improving the understanding of construct validity in software engineering.
Recommendations addressing the identified weaknesses are given to improve the

formation of dislocations. However, it remains unclear at which concentrations
H begins to play any role in the mechanical properties of Cu. In the current
study, we use density functional theory (DFT) to assess the accuracy of a bond
order potential (BOP) in simulating the segregation of H in Cu GB. BOP
accurately predicts the most favorable segregation sites of H in Cu GB, along
with the induced lattice relaxation effects. H is found to weaken the crystal

simulations using BOP are performed to evaluate the concentration of H in
bicrystalline Cu required to substantially impact the crystal's mechanical

the yield strength of bicrystalline Cu samples during uniaxial tensile strain
application. This effect was attributed to the fact that H interstitials within
the GB promoted the formation of partial dislocations.

  Over-Generalization","21 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over-generalization is a thorny issue in cognitive science, where people may
become overly cautious due to past experiences. Agents in multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) also have been found to suffer relative
over-generalization (RO) as people do and stuck to sub-optimal cooperation.
Recent methods have shown that assigning reasoning ability to agents can
mitigate RO algorithmically and empirically, but there has been a lack of
theoretical understanding of RO, let alone designing provably RO-free methods.
This paper first proves that RO can be avoided when the MARL method satisfies a
consistent reasoning requirement under certain conditions. Then we introduce a
novel reasoning framework, called negotiated reasoning, that first builds the
connection between reasoning and RO with theoretical justifications. After
that, we propose an instantiated algorithm, Stein variational negotiated
reasoning (SVNR), which uses Stein variational gradient descent to derive a
negotiation policy that provably avoids RO in MARL under maximum entropy policy
iteration. The method is further parameterized with neural networks for
amortized learning, making computation efficient. Numerical experiments on many
RO-challenged environments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of SVNR
compared to state-of-the-art methods in addressing RO.

strain-tuning in these materials. Consequently, we grew epitaxial EuPd$_2$
(magnetic Eu$^{2+}$) and EuPd$_3$ (nonmagnetic Eu$^{3+}$) thin films on
MgO(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Ambient X-ray diffraction
confirms an epitaxial relationship of cubic Laves-type (C15) EuPd$_2$ with an
(111)-out-of plane orientation, whereby four distinct in-plane crystallographic
domains develop. For simple cubic EuPd$_3$ two different out-of-plane
orientations can be obtained by changing the substrate annealing temperature
under ultra-high vacuum conditions from 600{\deg} C to 1000{\deg} C for one
hour. A small resistance minimum evolves for EuPd$_3$ thin films grown with low
temperature substrate annealing, which was previously found even in single
crystals of EuPd$_3$ and might be attributed to a Kondo or weak localization
effect. Absence of influence of an applied magnetic fields and magnetotransport
measurements suggest always a nonmagnetic ground state for EuPd$_3$ thin films,
i. e., a purely trivalent Eu valence, as previously found in EuPd3 single
crystals. For EuPd$_2$ magnetic ordering below ~72 K is observed, quite similar
to single crystal behaviour. Additional field dependent measurements of the
magnetoresistance and the Hall effect show hysteresis effects below ~0.4 T and
an anomalous Hall effect below ~70 K, which saturates around 1.4 T, thus
proving a ferromagnetic ground state of the divalent Eu.

wellbeing before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. A statistical
challenge in well-being survey studies lies in that outcome variables are often
recorded in different scales, be it continuous, binary, or ordinal. The
presence of mixed data complicates the assessment of the associations between
them while adjusting for covariates. In our study, of particular interest are
the associations between college students' wellbeing and other mental health
measures and how other risk factors moderate these associations during the
pandemic. To this end, we propose a unifying framework for studying partial
association between mixed data. This is achieved by defining a unified residual
using the surrogate method. The idea is to map the residual randomness to the
same continuous scale, regardless of the original scales of outcome variables.
It applies to virtually all commonly used models for covariate adjustments. We
demonstrate the validity of using such defined residuals to assess partial
association. In particular, we develop a measure that generalizes classical
Kendall's tau in the sense that it can size both partial and marginal
associations. More importantly, our development advances the theory of the
surrogate method developed in recent years by showing that it can be used
without requiring outcome variables having a latent variable structure. The use
of our method in the well-being survey analysis reveals (i) significant
moderation effects (i.e., the difference between partial and marginal
associations) of some key risk factors; and (ii) an elevated moderation effect
of physical health, loneliness, and accommodation after the onset of COVID-19.

$x$, $y$, $z$, if $x$ is better than $y$, and $y$ is better than $z$, then $x$
is better than $z$. It was recently observed that the Elo rating fails at
preserving transitive relations among strategies and therefore cannot correctly
extract the transitive component of a game. Our first contribution is to show
that the Elo rating actually does preserve transitivity when computed in the
right space. Precisely, using a suitable invertible mapping $\varphi$, we first
apply $\varphi$ to the game, then compute Elo ratings, then go back to the
original space by applying $\varphi^{-1}$. We provide a characterization of
transitive games as a weak variant of ordinal potential games with additively
separable potential functions. Leveraging this insight, we introduce the
concept of transitivity order, the minimum number of invertible mappings
required to transform the payoff of a transitive game into (differences of) its
potential function. The transitivity order is a tool to classify transitive
games, with Elo games being an example of transitive games of order one. Most
real-world games have both transitive and non-transitive (cyclic) components,
and we use our analysis of transitivity to extract the transitive (potential)
component of an arbitrary game. We link transitivity to the known concept of
sign-rank: transitive games have sign-rank two; arbitrary games may have higher
sign-rank. Using a neural network-based architecture, we learn a decomposition
of an arbitrary game into transitive and cyclic components that prioritises
capturing the sign pattern of the game. In particular, a transitive game always
has just one component in its decomposition, the potential component. We
provide a comprehensive evaluation of our methodology using both toy examples

restricted connectivity between qubits, as captured by the hardware's coupling
graph. This limitation poses a challenge for running algorithms that require a
coupling graph different from what the hardware can provide. To overcome this
challenge and fully utilize the hardware, efficient qubit routing strategies
are necessary. In this paper, we introduce line-graph qubit routing, a general
method for routing qubits when the algorithm's coupling graph is a line graph
and the hardware coupling graph is a heavy graph. Line-graph qubit routing is
fast, deterministic, and effective; it requires a classical computational cost
that scales at most quadratically with the number of gates in the original
circuit, while producing a circuit with a SWAP overhead of at most two times
the number of two-qubit gates in the original circuit. We implement line-graph
qubit routing and demonstrate its effectiveness in mapping quantum circuits on
kagome, checkerboard, and shuriken lattices to hardware with heavy-hex,
heavy-square, and heavy-square-octagon coupling graphs, respectively.
Benchmarking shows the ability of line-graph qubit routing to outperform
established general-purpose methods, both in the required classical wall-clock
time and in the quality of the solution that is found. Line-graph qubit routing
has direct applications in the quantum simulation of lattice-based models and
aids the exploration of the capabilities of near-term quantum hardware.

particle-in-cell simulations. Calculated electron energy probability functions
exhibit three distinct ``temperatures'' for low-, mid-, and high-energy
electrons. When compared to published experimental data, the calculated
probability functions show a reasonable agreement for the energy range resolved
in the measurements (about 2 eV to 10 eV). Discrepancies outside this range
lead to differences between computational and experimental values of the
electron number density determined from the distribution functions, but the
predicted effective electron temperature is within 25\% of experimental values.
The impedance of the discharge is interpreted in terms of a homogeneous
equivalent circuit model and the driving frequency dependence of the inferred
combined sheath thickness is found to obey a known, theoretically-derived,
power law. The average power transferred from the field to the electrons
(electron heating) is computed, and a region of negative heating near the
sheath edge, particularly at higher driving frequencies, is identified.
Analysis of the electron momentum equation shows that electron inertia, which
would average to zero in a linear regime, is responsible for negative values of
power deposition near the sheath edge at high driving frequencies due to the
highly nonlinear behavior of the discharge.

dominance) with age and a consistent decreasing valence with age. We also find
increasing emotional variability, rise rates (i.e., emotional reactivity), and
recovery rates (i.e., emotional regulation) with age. These results act as a
useful baselines for further research in how patterns of emotions expressed by

that the gravitational wave will not produce a scalar waveform in a vacuum. The

atmospheres >~1 bar since heat redistribution is expected to yield dayside
emission temperature below the ~500 K observed. Given the similar densities of
Trappist-1 planets, and the theoretical potential for atmospheric erosion
around late M-dwarfs, this observation might be assumed to imply substantial
atmospheres are also unlikely for the outer planets. However, the processes
governing atmosphere erosion and replenishment are fundamentally different for
inner and outer planets. Here, an atmosphere-interior evolution model is used
to show that an airless Trappist-1b (and c) only weakly constrains stellar
evolution, and that the odds of outer planets e and f retaining substantial
atmospheres remain largely unchanged. This is true even if the initial volatile
inventories of planets in the Trappist-1 system are highly correlated. The
reason for this result is that b and c sit unambiguously interior to the
runaway greenhouse limit, and so have potentially experienced ~8 Gyr of
XUV-driven hydrodynamic escape; complete atmospheric erosion in this
environment only weakly constrains stellar evolution and escape
parameterizations. In contrast, e and f reside within the habitable zone, and
likely experienced a comparatively short steam atmosphere during Trappist-1's
pre-main sequence, and consequently complete atmospheric erosion remains
unlikely across a broad swath of parameter space (e and f retain atmospheres in
~98% of model runs). Naturally, it is still possible that all Trappist-1
planets formed volatile-poor and are all airless today. But the airlessness of
b (and c) does not require this, and as such, JWST transit spectroscopy of e
and f remains the best near-term opportunity to characterize the atmospheres of
habitable zone terrestrial planets.

for various sources of uncertainties in pattern formation and data acquisition.
This method extracts the azimuthally-averaged power spectrum (AAPS) of the
top-down microscopy characterization of Di-BCP thin film patterns as summary
statistics for Bayesian inference of model parameters via the pseudo-marginal
method. We derive the analytical and approximate form of a conditional
likelihood for the AAPS of image data. We demonstrate that AAPS-based image
data reduction retains the mutual information, particularly on important length
scales, between image data and model parameters while being relatively agnostic
to the aleatoric uncertainties associated with the random long-range disorder
of Di-BCP patterns. Additionally, we propose a phase-informed prior
distribution for Bayesian model calibration. Furthermore, reducing image data
to AAPS enables us to efficiently build surrogate models to accelerate the
proposed Bayesian model calibration procedure. We present the formulation and
training of two multi-layer perceptrons for approximating the
parameter-to-spectrum map, which enables fast integrated likelihood
evaluations. We validate the proposed Bayesian model calibration method through

remote client data and the submodel information. In addition, a subset of
databases may fail, negatively affecting the FSL process, as FSL process may
take a non-negligible amount of time for large models. To resolve these two
issues together (i.e., security and database repair), we propose a novel coding
mechanism coined ramp secure regenerating coding (RSRC), to store the full
model in a distributed manner. Using our new RSRC method, the eavesdropper is
permitted to learn a controllable amount of submodel information for the sake
of reducing the communication and storage costs. Further, during the database
repair process, in the construction of the replacement database, the submodels
to be updated are stored in the form of their latest version from updating
clients, while the remaining submodels are obtained from the previous version
in other databases through routing clients. Our new RSRC-based distributed FSL
approach is constructed on top of our earlier two-database FSL scheme which
uses private set union (PSU). A complete one-round FSL process consists of
FSL-PSU phase, FSL-write phase and additional auxiliary phases. Our proposed
FSL scheme is also robust against database drop-outs, client drop-outs, client

Although continued pre-training on a large domain-specific corpus is effective,
it is costly to tune all the parameters on the domain. In this paper, we
investigate whether we can adapt PLMs both effectively and efficiently by only
tuning a few parameters. Specifically, we decouple the feed-forward networks
(FFNs) of the Transformer architecture into two parts: the original pre-trained
FFNs to maintain the old-domain knowledge and our novel domain-specific
adapters to inject domain-specific knowledge in parallel. Then we adopt a
mixture-of-adapters gate to fuse the knowledge from different domain adapters
dynamically. Our proposed Mixture-of-Domain-Adapters (MixDA) employs a
two-stage adapter-tuning strategy that leverages both unlabeled data and
labeled data to help the domain adaptation: i) domain-specific adapter on
unlabeled data; followed by ii) the task-specific adapter on labeled data.
MixDA can be seamlessly plugged into the pretraining-finetuning paradigm and
our experiments demonstrate that MixDA achieves superior performance on
in-domain tasks (GLUE), out-of-domain tasks (ChemProt, RCT, IMDB, Amazon), and

model is capable of understanding and generating human-like conversations about
videos. We introduce a new dataset of 100,000 video-instruction pairs used to
train Video-ChatGPT acquired via manual and semi-automated pipeline that is
easily scalable and robust to label noise. We also develop a quantiative
evaluation framework for video-based dialogue models to objectively analyse the
strengths and weaknesses of proposed models. Our code, models, instruction-sets
and demo are released at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-ChatGPT.

performance of large language models on interactive natural language tasks. For
interactive vision-language tasks involving intricate visual scenes, a large
quantity of diverse and creative instruction-response pairs should be
imperative to tune vision-language models (VLMs). Nevertheless, the current
availability of vision-language instruction-response pairs in terms of
quantity, diversity, and creativity remains limited, posing challenges to the
generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present MultI-Modal In-Context
Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT), a dataset comprising 2.8 million multimodal
instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instructions derived from
images and videos. Each pair is accompanied by multi-modal in-context
information, forming conversational contexts aimed at empowering VLMs in
perception, reasoning, and planning. The instruction-response collection
process, dubbed as Syphus, is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline
that combines human expertise with GPT's capabilities. Using the MIMIC-IT
dataset, we train a large VLM named Otter. Based on extensive evaluations
conducted on vision-language benchmarks, it has been observed that Otter
demonstrates remarkable proficiency in multi-modal perception, reasoning, and
in-context learning. Human evaluation reveals it effectively aligns with the
user's intentions. We release the MIMIC-IT dataset, instruction-response
collection pipeline, benchmarks, and the Otter model.

  with Backtracking",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In many domains, autoregressive models can achieve low log-likelihood on the
task of predicting the next observation. However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE)
objective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively
generating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences
proportionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance
for the model's behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding
error during autoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding
error problem, we formulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL)
problem. This allows us to minimize a variety of divergences between the
distribution of sequences generated by an autoregressive model and sequences
from a dataset, including divergences with weight on OOD generated sequences.
The IL framework also allows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a
backspace action into the generation process. This further mitigates the
compounding error problem by allowing the model to revert a sampled token if it
takes the sequence OOD. Our resulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented
without adversarial training or major architectural changes. We identify the
SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for
autoregressive models which are used for generation. We show that empirically,
SequenceMatch training leads to improvements over MLE on text generation with
language models.

datasets, text-to-image synthesis methods have shown compelling results.
However, these models still fail to precisely follow the text prompt when
multiple objects, attributes, and spatial compositions are involved in the
prompt. In this paper, we identify the potential reasons in both the
cross-attention and self-attention layers of the diffusion model. We propose
two novel losses to refocus the attention maps according to a given layout
during the sampling process. We perform comprehensive experiments on the
DrawBench and HRS benchmarks using layouts synthesized by Large Language
Models, showing that our proposed losses can be integrated easily and
effectively into existing text-to-image methods and consistently improve their
alignment between the generated images and the text prompts.

many vision, robotics, and graphics applications. However, current methods
often fail to produce accurate depth for objects in diverse scenes. In this
work, we propose a simple yet effective Background Prompting strategy that
adapts the input object image with a learned background. We learn the
background prompts only using small-scale synthetic object datasets. To infer
object depth on a real image, we place the segmented object into the learned
background prompt and run off-the-shelf depth networks. Background Prompting
helps the depth networks focus on the foreground object, as they are made
invariant to background variations. Moreover, Background Prompting minimizes
the domain gap between synthetic and real object images, leading to better
sim2real generalization than simple finetuning. Results on multiple synthetic
and real datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in real object depths for
a variety of existing depth networks. Code and optimized background prompts can

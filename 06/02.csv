dynamics, as is natural in the real-space framework of molecular simulations.
An alternative Fourier-space picture, that involves the collective charge
fluctuation modes of both the liquid and the confining wall, has recently been
successful at predicting new nanofluidic phenomena such as quantum friction and
near-field heat transfer, that rely on the coupling of those fluctuations.
Here, we study the charge fluctuation modes of a two-dimensional (planar)
nanofluidic channel. Introducing confined response functions that generalize
the notion of surface response function, we show that the channel walls exhibit
coupled plasmon modes as soon as the confinement is comparable to the plasmon
wavelength. Conversely, the water fluctuations remain remarkably bulk-like,
with significant confinement effects arising only when the wall spacing is
reduced to 7 A. We apply the confined response formalism to predict the
dependence of the solid-water quantum friction and thermal boundary conductance
on channel width for model channel wall materials. Our results provide a
general framework for Coulomb interactions of fluctuating matter in nanoscale
confinement.

Brain Metastases (RANO-BM) guideline, which utilizes the unidimensional longest

response to therapy in patients with brain metastases. However, accurate
volumetric assessment of the lesion and surrounding peri-lesional edema holds
significant importance in clinical decision-making and can greatly enhance
outcome prediction. The unique challenge in performing segmentations of brain
metastases lies in their common occurrence as small lesions. Detection and
segmentation of lesions that are smaller than 10 mm in size has not
demonstrated high accuracy in prior publications. The brain metastases
challenge sets itself apart from previously conducted MICCAI challenges on
glioma segmentation due to the significant variability in lesion size. Unlike
gliomas, which tend to be larger on presentation scans, brain metastases
exhibit a wide range of sizes and tend to include small lesions. We hope that
the BraTS-METS dataset and challenge will advance the field of automated brain
metastasis detection and segmentation.

driving, surgical robots, and industrial manipulators. Existing planning
methods lack scalability to higher-dimensional spaces, while recent learning
based planners have shown promise in accelerating sampling-based motion
planners (SMP) but lack generalizability to out-of-distribution environments.
To address this, we present a novel approach, Vector Quantized-Motion Planning
Transformers (VQ-MPT) that overcomes the key generalization and scaling
drawbacks of previous learning-based methods. VQ-MPT consists of two stages.
Stage 1 is a Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder model that learns to
represent the planning space using a finite number of sampling distributions,
and stage 2 is an Auto-Regressive model that constructs a sampling region for
SMPs by selecting from the learned sampling distribution sets. By splitting
large planning spaces into discrete sets and selectively choosing the sampling
regions, our planner pairs well with out-of-the-box SMPs, generating
near-optimal paths faster than without VQ-MPT's aid. It is generalizable in
that it can be applied to systems of varying complexities, from 2D planar to
14D bi-manual robots with diverse environment representations, including
costmaps and point clouds. Trained VQ-MPT models generalize to environments
unseen during training and achieve higher success rates than previous methods.

action spaces in a broad range of reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios.
However, theoretical understanding of non-stationary MDPs with general function
approximation is still limited. In this paper, we make the first such an
attempt. We first propose a new complexity metric called dynamic Bellman Eluder
(DBE) dimension for non-stationary MDPs, which subsumes majority of existing
tractable RL problems in static MDPs as well as non-stationary MDPs. Based on
the proposed complexity metric, we propose a novel confidence-set based
model-free algorithm called SW-OPEA, which features a sliding window mechanism
and a new confidence set design for non-stationary MDPs. We then establish an
upper bound on the dynamic regret for the proposed algorithm, and show that
SW-OPEA is provably efficient as long as the variation budget is not
significantly large. We further demonstrate via examples of non-stationary
linear and tabular MDPs that our algorithm performs better in small variation
budget scenario than the existing UCB-type algorithms. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dynamic regret analysis in non-stationary MDPs
with general function approximation.

indispensable recipes for generalizable forgery detection. Recently, large
pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown promising generalization
capability. In this paper, we propose the first parameter-efficient tuning
approach for deepfake detection, namely DeepFake-Adapter, to effectively and
efficiently adapt the generalizable high-level semantics from large pre-trained
ViTs to aid deepfake detection. Given large pre-trained models but limited
deepfake data, DeepFake-Adapter introduces lightweight yet dedicated dual-level
adapter modules to a ViT while keeping the model backbone frozen. Specifically,
to guide the adaptation process to be aware of both global and local forgery
cues of deepfake data, 1) we not only insert Globally-aware Bottleneck Adapters
in parallel to MLP layers of ViT, 2) but also actively cross-attend
Locally-aware Spatial Adapters with features from ViT. Unlike existing deepfake
detection methods merely focusing on low-level forgery patterns, the forgery
detection process of our model can be regularized by generalizable high-level
semantics from a pre-trained ViT and adapted by global and local low-level
forgeries of deepfake data. Extensive experiments on several standard deepfake
detection benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach. Notably,
DeepFake-Adapter demonstrates a convincing advantage under cross-dataset and

two-stage model that refines the state change prediction conditioned on
entities predicted from the first stage. Empirical results show the

conditions the infinite-volume critical point is an effective finite-volume
critical point, whereas for free boundary conditions the effective critical
point is shifted smaller by an amount of order $R^{-2}$. For both boundary
conditions, the average field has the same non-Gaussian limit within a critical
window of width $R^{-d/2}$ around the effective critical point, and in that
window we compute the universal scaling profile for the susceptibility. In
contrast, and again for both boundary conditions, the average field has a
massive Gaussian limit when above the effective critical point by an amount
$R^{-2}$. In particular, at the infinite-volume critical point the
susceptibility scales as $R^{d/2}$ for periodic boundary conditions and as
$R^{2}$ for free boundary conditions. We identify a mass generation mechanism

typically quantified in terms of the characteristic strain, $A_{\rm 1 yr}$, at
a frequency $1\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, encodes significant astrophysical information
about the SMBH binary (SMBHB) population, including the mass and redshift
distributions of SMBHBs. Recent results from a number of pulsar timing arrays
have identified a common-spectrum noise process that is consistent with a loud
GWB signal with amplitude $A_{\rm 1 yr}{\sim}2\times10^{-15}$, which is higher
than typical predictions $A_{\rm 1 yr} \lesssim 10^{-15}$. These predictions
usually assume theoretically-motivated but highly uncertain prescriptions for

to the GWB from high redshift ($z\gtrsim 1$) SMBHBs, for which few robust
observational constraints exist. We find that the GWB amplitude may be higher

observations of the high redshift SMBH population from the James Webb Space

three common pitfalls in message passing for link prediction. Particularly, in
prevalent GNN frameworks (e.g., DGL and PyTorch-Geometric), the target edges
(i.e., the edges being predicted) consistently exist as message passing edges
in the graph during training. Consequently, this results in overfitting and
distribution shift, both of which adversely impact the generalizability to test
the target edges. Additionally, during test time, the failure to exclude the
test target edges leads to implicit test leakage caused by neighborhood
aggregation. In this paper, we analyze these three pitfalls and investigate the
impact of including or excluding target edges on the performance of nodes with
varying degrees during training and test phases. Our theoretical and empirical
analysis demonstrates that low-degree nodes are more susceptible to these
pitfalls. These pitfalls can have detrimental consequences when GNNs are
implemented in production systems. To systematically address these pitfalls, we
propose SpotTarget, an effective and efficient GNN training framework. During
training, SpotTarget leverages our insight regarding low-degree nodes and
excludes train target edges connected to at least one low-degree node. During
test time, it emulates real-world scenarios of GNN usage in production and
excludes all test target edges. Our experiments conducted on diverse real-world

applications of RNNs, only a specific subset of the neurons generally receive

Considering recurrent neural networks with such restricted input, we
investigate how the proportion, $p$, of the neurons receiving inputs (the
""inputs neurons"") and a quantity, $\xi$, representing the strength of the input
signals affect the dynamics by analytically deriving the conditional maximum
Lyapunov exponent. Our results show that for sufficiently large $p$, the
maximum Lyapunov exponent decreases monotonically as a function of $\xi$,
indicating the suppression of chaos, but if $p$ is smaller than a critical
threshold, $p_c$, even significantly amplified inputs cannot suppress
spontaneous chaotic dynamics. Furthermore, although the value of $p_c$ is
seemingly dependent on several model parameters, such as the sparseness and
strength of recurrent connections, it is proved to be intrinsically determined
solely by the strength of chaos in spontaneous activity of the RNN. This is to
say, despite changes in these model parameters, it is possible to represent the
value of $p_c$ as a common invariant function by appropriately scaling these
parameters to yield the same strength of spontaneous chaos. Our study suggests
that if $p$ is above $p_c$, we can bring the neural network to the edge of
chaos, thereby maximizing its information processing capacity, by adjusting

of previously unknown candidate structures in the small Pt NP limit, where
exposure to hydrogen leads to the appearance of a `quasi-icosahedral'
intermediate symmetry, followed by the formation of `rosettes' on the NP
surface. Hydrogen adsorption is found to catalyze these shape transitions by
lowering their temperatures and increasing the apparent rates, revealing the
dual catalytic and dynamic nature of interaction between nanoparticle and
adsorbate. Our study also offers a new pathway for deciphering the reversible
evolution of catalyst structure resulting from the chemisorption of reactive

J1846-0258 with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the
timing and spectral evolution during its outburst in August 2020.
Phase-coherent timing solutions were maintained from March 2017 through
November 2021, including a coherent solution throughout the outburst. We
detected a large spin-up glitch of magnitude \Delta\nu/\nu = 3 X 10^{-6} at the
start of the outburst and observed an increase in pulsed flux that reached a
factor of more than 10 times the quiescent level, a behavior similar to that of
the 2006 outburst. Our monitoring observations in June and July 2020 indicate
that the flux was rising prior to the SWIFT announcement of the outburst on
August 1, 2020. We also observed several sharp rises in the pulsed flux
following the outburst and the flux reached quiescent level by November 2020.
The pulse profile was observed to change shape during the outburst, returning
to the pre-outburst shape by 2021. Spectral analysis of the pulsed emission of
NICER data shows that the flux increases result entirely from a new black body
component that gradually fades away while the power-law remains nearly constant
at its quiescent level throughout the outburst. Joint spectral analysis of
NICER and simultaneous NuSTAR data confirms this picture. We discuss the
interpretation of the magnetar-like outburst and origin of the transient
thermal component in the context of both a pulsar-like and a magnetar-like
model.

solving a sparsity-regularized inverse problem. Traditional CS solvers use

space to the original image space. The latter outperforms the former, but is
restrictive to a pre-defined measurement domain. More recent, deep unrolling
methods combine traditional proximal gradient methods and data-driven
approaches to iteratively refine an image approximation. To achieve higher
accuracy, it has also been suggested to learn both the sampling matrix, and the
choice of measurement vectors adaptively. Contrary to the current trend, in
this work we hypothesize that a general inverse mapping from a random set of
compressed measurements to the image domain exists for a given measurement
basis, and can be learned. Such a model is single-shot, non-restrictive and
does not parametrize the sampling process. To this end, we propose MOSAIC, a
novel compressive sensing framework to reconstruct images given any random
selection of measurements, sampled using a fixed basis. Motivated by the uneven
distribution of information across measurements, MOSAIC incorporates an
embedding technique to efficiently apply attention mechanisms on an encoded

molecules are modeled as 2-dimensional Lennard-Jones disks with three hydrogen
bonding arms arranged symmetrically, resembling the Mercedes-Benz logo. The MB
model qualitatively predicts both the anomalous properties of pure water and
the anomalous solvation thermodynamics of non-polar molecules. One of the
features of this earlier model was to have a pair correlation function with
first peak for the Lennard-Jones contact distinct of that corresponding to the
hydrogen bonding, which is very different from real water which has a single
first peak, but a dual peak for the structure factor. The site-site model
proposed here reproduces this typical feature of real water, both in real and
reciprocal space. It also reproduces several of the known anomalies of real
water, such as the density maximum. In addition, because of the screened
Coulomb interaction between the sites, the new model appear to exhibit more
homogeneity that the MB models and their variants, the latter which is
highlighted by a k=0 increase of their structure factors. The new model
transfers the usual bond order paradigm into a charge order paradigm, enforcing
atom-atom interactions over orientational interactions.

system-reservoirs correlations in stochastic thermodynamics (ST). More
specifically, we first show that boundary conditions at the macroscopic level
define a natural decomposition of the entropy production rate (EPR) in terms of
thermodynamic forces multiplying their conjugated currents, as well as a change
in suitable nonequilibrium potential that acts as a Lyapunov function in
absence of forces. At the microscale, for isolated Hamiltonian systems, we
identify the exact identities at the origin of these dissipative contributions.
Indeed, the molecular chaos hypothesis, which gives rise to the Boltzmann
equation at the mesoscale, leads to a positive rate of loss of many-particle
correlations which we identify with the Boltzmann entropy production rate. By
generalizing the Boltzmann equation to account for boundaries with nonuniform
temperature and nonzero velocity, and resorting to the Chapman--Enskog
expansion, we reproduce the macroscopic theory we started from. We also show
that an equivalent mesoscale description in terms of a linearized Boltzmann
equation obeys local detailed balance (LDB) and thus reproduces a ST theory.

Typical simple disorder liquid are liquid nitrogen, or weakly polar liquids.
Complex liquids concern those who can form long lived local assemblies, and
cover a large range from water to soft matter and biological liquids. The
existence of such structures leaves characteric features upon the atom-atom
correlation functions, concerning both atoms which directly participate to
these structure and those who do not. The question we ask here is: does these
features have also characteristic dynamical aspects, which could be tracked
through dynamical correlation functions. Herein, we compare the van Hove
function, intermediate scattering function and the dynamical structure factor,
for both types of liquids, using force field models and computer simulations.
The calculations reveal the paradoxical fact that neighbouring atom
correlations for simple disorder liquids relax slower than that for complex
disorder liquids, while prepeak features typical of complex disorder liquids
relax even slower. This is an indication of the existence of fast kinetic
self-assembly processes in complex disorder liquids, while the lifetime of such
assemblies itself is quite slow. This is further confirmed by the existence of
a very low-k dynamical pre-peak uncovered in the case of water and ethanol.

on more than one set of features, guaranteeing a more fine-grained control over
the generated face images. We evaluate our approach on the CelebA-HQ dataset,

task, termed as Vocabulary-free Image Classification (VIC), where we aim to
assign to an input image a class that resides in an unconstrained
language-induced semantic space, without the prerequisite of a known
vocabulary. VIC is a challenging task as the semantic space is extremely large,
containing millions of concepts, with hard-to-discriminate fine-grained
categories. In this work, we first empirically verify that representing this

effective way to obtain semantically relevant content for classifying the

extracts a set of candidate categories from captions retrieved from the

$\alpha$-dependence of the scalar spectral tilt yields novel constraints on
$\alpha$. In particular, for small $\alpha$, the scalar spectral tilt scales
with $\log_{10}\alpha$, regardless of the specific potential shape. For
decreasing $\alpha$, this eventually puts the models in tension with CMB

off-the-shelf neural networks' theory of mind in a zero-shot setting while
showing robust out-of-distribution performance compared to supervised

a method for selecting the single best reconstruction from among the samples

generation to address the data scarcity problem in low-resource complex NER.
ACLM alleviates the context-entity mismatch issue, a problem existing NER data
augmentation techniques suffer from and often generates incoherent
augmentations by placing complex named entities in the wrong context. ACLM
builds on BART and is optimized on a novel text reconstruction or denoising
task - we use selective masking (aided by attention maps) to retain the named
entities and certain keywords in the input sentence that provide contextually
relevant additional knowledge or hints about the named entities. Compared with
other data augmentation strategies, ACLM can generate more diverse and coherent
augmentations preserving the true word sense of complex entities in the

quantitatively on monolingual, cross-lingual, and multilingual complex NER
across various low-resource settings. ACLM outperforms all our neural baselines

half-BPS operators with $R$-charge $J$ in the limit $J\to\infty$ with
$\lambda_{J}\equiv g_{\rm YM}^2 J/2$ fixed. The dynamics in this {\it large

$\mathfrak{psu}(2|2)^2$ symmetry that played a crucial role for the planar
integrability. To the leading order in $1/J$, the spectrum is fully fixed by
this symmetry, manifesting the magnon dispersion relation familiar from the
planar limit, while it is constrained up to a few constants at the next order.
We also determine the structure constant of two large charge operators and the
Konishi operator, revealing a rich structure interpolating between the
perturbative series at weak coupling and the worldline instantons at strong
coupling. In addition we compute heavy-heavy-light-light (HHLL) four-point
functions of half-BPS operators in terms of resummed conformal integrals and
recast them into an integral form reminiscent of the hexagon formalism in the
planar limit. For general ${\rm SU}(N)$ gauge groups, we study integrated HHLL
correlators by supersymmetric localization and identify a dual matrix model of

expensive (few labs can participate), everyone uses different robots (findings

take on these challenges via a new benchmark: Train Offline, Test Online
(TOTO). TOTO provides remote users with access to shared robotic hardware for
evaluating methods on common tasks and an open-source dataset of these tasks
for offline training. Its manipulation task suite requires challenging
generalization to unseen objects, positions, and lighting. We present initial
results on TOTO comparing five pretrained visual representations and four
offline policy learning baselines, remotely contributed by five institutions.
The real promise of TOTO, however, lies in the future: we release the benchmark
for additional submissions from any user, enabling easy, direct comparison to
several methods without the need to obtain hardware or collect data.

convenient in conveying the overall scene context, it may be insufficient to

utilizing text as context description and motion structure (e.g. frame-wise
depth) as concrete guidance. Our method, dubbed Make-Your-Video, involves
joint-conditional video generation using a Latent Diffusion Model that is
pre-trained for still image synthesis and then promoted for video generation
with the introduction of temporal modules. This two-stage learning scheme not
only reduces the computing resources required, but also improves the
performance by transferring the rich concepts available in image datasets
solely into video generation. Moreover, we use a simple yet effective causal
attention mask strategy to enable longer video synthesis, which mitigates the
potential quality degradation effectively. Experimental results show the
superiority of our method over existing baselines, particularly in terms of
temporal coherence and fidelity to users' guidance. In addition, our model
enables several intriguing applications that demonstrate potential for
practical usage.

Our framework extends the standard setup by allowing for general types of data,

generalization covers many cases of practical interest, such as data acquired
in transform domains (e.g., Fourier data), vector-valued data (e.g.,
gradient-augmented data), data acquired along continuous curves, and,
multimodal data (i.e., combinations of different types of measurements). Our
framework considers random sampling according to a finite number of sampling
measures and arbitrary nonlinear approximation spaces (model classes). We
introduce the concept of generalized Christoffel functions and show how these
can be used to optimize the sampling measures. We prove that this leads to
near-optimal sample complexity in various important cases. This paper focuses
on applications in scientific computing, where active learning is often
desirable, since it is usually expensive to generate data. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our framework for gradient-augmented learning with polynomials,

pragmatics, and abstract thought. Towards making sense of this fundamentally
unsolved problem, this work identifies and analyzes the phenomenon of attention
glitches, in which the Transformer architecture's inductive biases
intermittently fail to capture robust reasoning. To isolate the issue, we
introduce flip-flop language modeling (FFLM), a parametric family of synthetic

over long-range dependencies, ignoring the tokens in between. We find that
Transformer FFLMs suffer from a long tail of sporadic reasoning errors, some of

mechanistic analyses show why the remaining errors may be very difficult to
diagnose and resolve. We hypothesize that attention glitches account for (some

reranking hypotheses by using Transformers to efficiently encode lattices of

the entire lattice, we can approximately compute a contextualized

that emerge from cosmological sources and last for $\sim$ a few milliseconds.
However, their origin remains a highly debated topic in astronomy. Recent
studies have argued for a possible association between the binary neutron star
(BNS) merger GW190425 and FRB20190425A at a confidence level of 2.8$\sigma$.
The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived highly
magnetized supramassive neutron star (SMNS) that formed after the BNS merger
and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a
black hole. In this study, we investigate the proposed association, carefully
considering the constraint that the FRB signal must traverse the high-density
merger ejecta without experiencing noticeable attenuation to enable its
detection at 400 MHz. Furthermore, we find that if the FRB is indeed linked to
the gravitational wave event, the GW data strongly support a highly off-axis
configuration, with a probability of the BNS merger viewing angle $p(\theta_v$
$>$ 30$^{\circ}$) to be $\approx$ 99.99%. Our findings therefore strongly
exclude an on-axis system, which we find on the other hand to be required in
order for this FRB to be detectable. Hence, we conclude that GW190425 is not
related to FRB20190425A. We also discuss implications of our results for future
detections of coincident multi-messenger observations of FRBs from BNS remnants

of an all-loop, all-multiplicity amplituhedron for three-dimensional planar

We show that by simply changing the overall sign of the positive region of the
original amplituhedron for four-dimensional planar $\mathcal{N}{=}4$
super-Yang-Mills (sYM) and performing a symplectic reduction, only
three-dimensional kinematics in the middle sector of even-multiplicity survive.
The resulting form of the geometry, combined with its parity images, gives the
full loop integrand. This simple modification geometrically enforces the
vanishing of odd-multiplicity cuts, and manifests the correct soft and
two-particle unitarity cuts. Furthermore, the so-called ``bipartite structures""
of four-point all-loop negative geometries also directly generalize to all
multiplicities. We introduce a novel triangulation of the loop amplituhedron
based on the kinematics of the tree region, resulting in local integrands
tailored to ``prescriptive unitarity"". This construction sheds a fascinating
new light on the interplay between loop and tree amplituhedra for both ABJM and
$\mathcal{N}{=}4$ sYM: the loop-geometry demands that the tree region must be
dissected into \textit{chambers}, defined by the simultaneous positivity of
maximal cuts. The loop geometry is then ``fibration"" of the tree region. Using
the new construction, we give explicit results of one-loop integrands up to ten
points and two-loop integrands up to eight points by computing the canonical
form of ABJM loop amplituhedron.

Universe, known as Population III (PopIII) stars, is one of the most important
goals of modern astrophysics. Recent models suggest that PopIII stars may form
in pockets of pristine gas in the halo of more evolved galaxies. Here we
present NIRSpec-IFU and NIRSpec-MSA observations of the region around GN-z11,
an exceptionally luminous galaxy at $z=10.6$, which reveal a $>$5$\sigma$
detection of a feature consistent with being HeII$\lambda$1640 emission at the
redshift of GN-z11. The very high equivalent width of the putative HeII
emission in this clump (170 A), and the lack of metal lines, can be explained
in terms of photoionisation by PopIII stars, while photoionisation by PopII
stars is inconsistent with the data. It would also indicate that the putative
PopIII stars likely have a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF), with an upper
cutoff reaching at least 500 M$_\odot$. The PopIII bolometric luminosity
inferred from the HeII line would be $\sim 2\times 10^{10}~L_\odot$, which
(with a top-heavy IMF) would imply a total stellar mass formed in the burst of
$\sim 6\times 10^{5}~M_\odot$. We find that photoionisation by the Active
Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in GN-z11 cannot account for the HeII luminosity
observed in the clump, but can potentially be responsible for additional HeII
emission observed closer to GN-z11. We also consider the possibility of in-situ
photoionisation by an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH) hosted by the
HeII clump; we find that this scenario is less favoured, but it remains a
possible alternative interpretation. We also report the detection of a
Ly$\alpha$ halo stemming out of GN-z11 and extending out to $\sim$2 kpc, as
well as resolved, funnel-shaped CIII] emission, likely tracing the ionisation
cone of the AGN.

thermalized buckling of isotopically compressed thin (perhaps atomically thin)
sheets of materials such as graphene or MoS$_2$. These investigations were
inspired by Michael's beautiful work on the effect of constraints at critical
points, with fluctuations at all length scales, which leads to 'Fisher
renormalization' of critical exponents. [1] Thin fluctuating sheets embedded in
three dimensions, when they are tensionless as in a cantilever or 'diving
board' geometry, are automatically at a critical point everywhere in a low
temperature flat phase. However, when we consider thin sheets supported on
multiple sides in various ways, Fisher's ideas lead to the inequivalence of
isotensional and isometric thermodynamic ensembles, which triggers dramatic
differences in some of the critical exponents associated with the two types of
boundary conditions. [2] Readers not interested in my experiences while a
student at Cornell University may only want to read parts I and III. There are

to a power law, is a feature of debated physical origin found in the X-ray
spectra of many type-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). The eROSITA instrument
aboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission will provide an all-sky census
of AGN suitable for spectral analysis. Aims. The primary goal of this work is
to test a variety of models for the soft X-ray emission of AGN (thermal
emission, non-thermal emission, ionised absorption, or neutral partial covering
absorption) to help identify the physical origin of the soft X-ray spectral
complexity. Differences between these models are examined in the context of
this sample to understand the physical properties. Methods. We used Bayesian
X-ray analysis to fit a sample of 200 AGN from the eFEDS hard X-ray--selected
sample with a variety of phenomenological and physically motivated models.
Model selection was performed using the Bayes factor to compare the
applicability of each model. Results. We find that 29 sources have evidence for
a soft excess at a confidence level >97.5%, all of which are better modelled by
an additional soft power law than by thermal blackbody emission. We find 23 of
these sources prefer a warm corona model, while six sources prefer relativistic
blurred reflection. Additionally many sources show evidence for complex
absorption, with 29 preferring a warm absorber and 25 a partial covering
absorber. Sources with a soft excess show a significantly higher Eddington
ratio than those with warm absorbers. We discuss the implication of these
results for the physical processes in the central regions of AGN. Conclusions.
Spectral fitting with Bayesian statistics is ideal for the identification of
complex absorption and soft excesses in the X-ray spectra of AGN and can allow
one to distinguish between different physical interpretations. (Abridged)

cooling techniques. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to create ultracold
polyatomic molecules by electroassociation in a degenerate Fermi gas of
microwave-dressed polar molecules through a field-linked resonance. Starting
from ground state NaK molecules, we create around $1.1\times 10^3$ tetratomic
(NaK)$_2$ molecules, with a phase space density of $0.040(3)$ at a temperature
of $134(3)\,\text{nK}$, more than $3000$ times colder than previously realized
tetratomic molecules. We observe a maximum tetramer lifetime of
$8(2)\,\text{ms}$ in free space without a notable change in the presence of an
optical dipole trap, indicating these tetramers are collisionally stable. The
measured binding energy and lifetime agree well with parameter-free
calculations, which outlines pathways to further increase the lifetime of the
tetramers. Moreover, we directly image the dissociated tetramers through
microwave-field modulation to probe the anisotropy of their wave function in
momentum space. Our result demonstrates a universal tool for assembling
ultracold polyatomic molecules from smaller polar molecules, which is a crucial
step towards Bose--Einstein condensation (BEC) of polyatomic molecules and
towards a new crossover from a dipolar Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluid to a BEC of tetramers. Additionally, the long-lived FL state
provides an ideal starting point for deterministic optical transfer to deeply
bound tetramer states.

problem. A recent advance proposes a panoptic 3D scene reconstruction task that
performs both 3D reconstruction and 3D panoptic segmentation from a single
image. Although having made substantial progress, recent works only focus on
top-down approaches that fill 2D instances into 3D voxels according to
estimated depth, which hinders their performance by two ambiguities. (1)
instance-channel ambiguity: The variable ids of instances in each scene lead to
ambiguity during filling voxel channels with 2D information, confusing the
following 3D refinement. (2) voxel-reconstruction ambiguity: 2D-to-3D lifting
with estimated single view depth only propagates 2D information onto the
surface of 3D regions, leading to ambiguity during the reconstruction of
regions behind the frontal view surface. In this paper, we propose BUOL, a
Bottom-Up framework with Occupancy-aware Lifting to address the two issues for
panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from a single image. For instance-channel
ambiguity, a bottom-up framework lifts 2D information to 3D voxels based on
deterministic semantic assignments rather than arbitrary instance id
assignments. The 3D voxels are then refined and grouped into 3D instances
according to the predicted 2D instance centers. For voxel-reconstruction
ambiguity, the estimated multi-plane occupancy is leveraged together with depth
to fill the whole regions of things and stuff. Our method shows a tremendous
performance advantage over state-of-the-art methods on synthetic dataset

parameters. In this paper, we present accurate measurements of the quadratic
shape bias parameters by combining the $\textit{full three-dimensional}$ power
spectrum of the intrinsic alignments (i.e., without any projection) with the
quadratic field method. In order to benefit from the full three-dimensional
power spectrum we employ the spherical tensor decomposition of the
three-dimensional shape field and measure their power spectra for the first
time. In particular, we detect the vector and tensor power spectra in this
basis, which cannot be explained by the widely-used nonlinear alignment model.
Further, by cross-correlating the three-dimensional halo shape field with the
quadratic shape bias operators from the initial condition of the same
simulation to cancel cosmic variance, we effectively extract bispectrum
information and detect quadratic shape bias parameters in the intrinsic
alignments with high significance for the first time. We also compare these
measurements with the prediction where quadratic shape biases are dynamically
generated from the linear Lagrandian shape bias through the large-scale bulk
flow. We find general agreement for all three biases with small deviations,
which in practice could be negligible for the current photometric surveys. This
implies that the advection prediction for the higher-order shape biases can be
used as a prior in the cosmological analyses of intrinsic alignments.

\emph{ab initio} simulations to accurately predict the inhomogeneous response
of two widely different fluids: liquid water and molten NaCl. Although the
advantages of NNPs is that they can be readily trained to model complex
systems, one limitation in modeling the inhomogeneous response of liquids is
the need for including the correct configurations of the system in the training
data. Therefore, first we establish protocols, based on molecular dynamics
simulations in external atomic potentials, to sufficiently sample the correct

inhomogeneous fluid configurations can predict several properties such as the

ability on different domains and modalities, without overfitting to the

${w}$, then for each type of intrinsic image, there is a fixed offset ${d}_c$
so that $G({w}+{d}_c)$ is that type of intrinsic image for $G({w})$. Here

an innovative architecture designed specifically for continuous organ and tumor

involves replacing the conventional output layer with a suite of lightweight,

new classes on old ones during the course of continual learning. We further

establish two results using the statistical mechanics of $k$-fold replicated

that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group
of number conserving unitaries. Specifically, the circuits form a $k_c$-design
with $k_c = O(L^d)$ for a system in $d$ spatial dimensions with linear

conservation $\tau \gtrsim k L^{d}$. The convergence of the circuit ensemble is
controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum

spectral and flux variability observed in this AGN. Detections of rSMBHs are
important for understanding the processes by which SMBH binaries merge and how
rSMBHs influence their galactic environment through feedback mechanisms.
However, conclusive identification of any rSMBHs has remained elusive to date.
In this paper, we present an analysis of 6.5 years of multi-frequency Very Long
Baseline Array (VLBA) monitoring of Mrk 1018. We find that the radio emission
is compact down to 2.4 pc, and displays flux density and spectral variability
over the length of our campaign, typical of a flat spectrum radio core. We
observe proper motion in RA of the radio core at -36.4 $\pm$ 8.6 $\mu$as

significant proper motion is found in DEC (31.3 $\pm$ 25.1 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$).
We discuss possible physical mechanisms driving the proper motion, including a
rSMBH. We conclude that the apparent velocity we observe of the VLBI radio core
is too high to reconcile with theoretical predictions of rSMBH velocities and
that the proper motion is most likely dominated by an unresolved, outflowing
jet component. Future observations may yet reveal the true nature of Mrk 1018.
However, our observations are not able to confirm it as a true rSMBH.

results on key observables such as $V_{ud}$, the invisible decay width of the

considering the full correlations among the different observables and
explicitly calibrating the test statistic, which may present significant
deviations from a $\chi^2$ distribution. The results are provided for three
different Type-I seesaw scenarios: the minimal scenario with only two
additional right-handed neutrinos, the next to minimal one with three extra
neutrinos, and the most general one with an arbitrary number of heavy neutrinos
that we parametrize via a generic deviation from a unitary leptonic mixing
matrix. Additionally, we also analyze the case of generic deviations from
unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix, not necessarily induced by the
presence of additional neutrinos. This last case relaxes some correlations
among the parameters and is able to provide a better fit to the data.
Nevertheless, inducing only leptonic unitarity deviations avoiding both the
correlations implied by the right-handed neutrino extension as well as more
strongly constrained operators is challenging and would imply significantly
more complex UV completions.

Three-dimensional non-local thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE)
radiative transfer calculations are a fundamental tool for a detailed spectral
analysis in stellar atmospheres, but require vast amounts of computer power.
This prevents their broader application. Aims. We undertake a first exploration
of the use of 3D irregular grids in stellar atmospheres. In particular, we aim
to test whether irregular grids can be used to speed up the 3D NLTE problem, in
the same way as depth optimisation can lead to faster running times in 1D.
Methods. We created irregular grids based on 3D Voronoi diagrams, sampling
different distributions from a 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamic Bifrost
simulation. We developed a method for solving radiation on the 3D irregular
grid and implemented a simple NLTE solver using $\Lambda$-iteration and
statistical equilibrium. We applied this to a simplified hydrogen-like atom and
studied the convergence properties and accuracy of the irregular grid methods.
For reference, we compared them to a standard short-characteristics solver on a
regular grid. Results. We find that our method for radiation in irregular grids
gives similar results to those from regular grids, and that it is possible to
obtain nearly the same results with about ten times fewer points in the
irregular grid for the continuum intensity in local thermodynamical
equilibrium. We find that the irregular grid can give good results for the NLTE
problem, but it takes four times longer per iteration than the regular grid,
and it converges in about the same number of iterations. This makes it
particularly inefficient. Our formulation therefore does not lead to an
improvement. We also find that the design of the irregular grid is crucial for
accurate results, and find it non-trivial to design an irregular grid that can
work well across a wide range of heights.

galaxy is challenging as the quasar largely overshines its host. Here, we
present a novel technique to probe quasar-host relations beyond the local
universe with strong gravitational lensing, hence overcoming the use of stellar
population models or velocity dispersion measurements, both prone to
degeneracies. We study in detail one of the three known cases of strong lensing
by a quasar to accurately measure the mass of its host and to infer a total
lensing mass of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm Tot, h}/M_{\odot}) = 10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}~$

motion of baryons and dark matter at recombination, could be the progenitors of
early globular clusters. In order to become GCs, SIGOs must form stars
relatively efficiently despite forming outside of dark matter halos. We
investigate the potential for star formation in SIGOs using cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations, including the aforementioned relative motions of
baryons and dark matter, molecular hydrogen cooling in primordial gas clouds,
and including explicit star formation. We find that SIGOs do form stars and
that the nascent star clusters formed through this process are accreted by dark
matter halos on short timescales (a few hundreds of Myr). Thus, SIGOs may be
found as intact substructures within these halos, analogous to many present-day
GCs. From this result, we conclude that SIGOs are capable of forming star
clusters with similar properties to globular clusters in the early Universe and
we discuss their detectablity by upcoming JWST surveys.

\times K$, where the internal space is a compact manifold equipped with a
vacuum metric, denoted $g_K^0$, whose isometry group becomes the gauge group in
four dimensions. In these notes we discuss a variant approach where part of the
gauge group does not come from full isometries of $g_K^0$, but instead comes
from weaker internal symmetries that only preserve the Einstein-Hilbert action
on $K$. Then the weaker symmetries are spontaneously broken by the choice of
vacuum metric and generate massive gauge bosons within the Kaluza-Klein
framework, with no need to introduce ad hoc Higgs fields. Using the language of
Riemannian submersions, it is shown that a gauge boson's classical mass depends
on the Lie derivative of $g_K^0$ along the associated internal symmetry. The
presence of gauge fields that are not associated with exact isometries of
$g_K^0$ may help to circumvent certain no-go arguments against the existence of
chiral fermions in Kaluza-Klein theories. In parallel, we also discuss the
traditional assumption that the Kaluza-Klein vacuum is represented by a product
Einstein metric. This should not be true when that metric is unstable. In fact,
the unravelling of the Einstein metric along unstable perturbations may be a
desirable feature of the model. It allows certain components of the metric to
change length scale and become compatible with a small cosmological constant.
In the case of the Lie group $K=SU(3)$, the unravelling of the bi-invariant
metric along an unstable perturbation also breaks the isometry group from
$(SU(3)\times SU(3))/Z_3$ down to $(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1))/ Z_6$, the
gauge group of the Standard Model. We tentatively suggest a mechanism to
stabilize the internal metric after that symmetry breaking and discuss a
subsequent electroweak symmetry breaking at a different mass scale.

lower detection rate of HI absorption lines ($\sim$$11.5\%$) in low-power radio

more extended sources and dilution by HI emission at lower redshifts may
contribute to the lower detection rate of HI absorption lines. These detected
absorbers present relatively narrow line widths and comparable column densities
consistent with previous observations. One absorber has a symmetric profile
with a large velocity offset, while the other two show asymmetric profiles that
can be decomposed into multiple components, suggesting various possibilities of

integrated and spatially-resolved -- and to different galaxy formation models

simulation, the fraction of accreted stars can be inferred with very high
accuracy, with an error $\sim5$ per cent (10 per cent) from 2D integral-field
spectroscopic maps (integrated quantities) throughout the considered stellar
mass range. A bias (> 5 per cent) and an increase in scatter by a factor of 2
are introduced when testing with a different simulation, revealing a lack of
generalization to distinct galaxy-formation models. Interestingly, upon using
only stellar mass and kinematics maps in the central galactic regions for
training, we find that this bias is removed and the ex-situ stellar mass
fraction can be recovered in both simulations with < 15 per cent scatter,
independently of the training set's origin. This opens up the door to a

$\Delta(\epsilon,T)/\Delta(\epsilon=0,T)$ up to exponentially small

(LMs) improves processing of visually-rich documents such as scientific papers.
Layout-infused LMs are often evaluated on documents with familiar layout
features (e.g., papers from the same publisher), but in practice models
encounter documents with unfamiliar distributions of layout features, such as
new combinations of text sizes and styles, or new spatial configurations of
textual elements. In this work we test whether layout-infused LMs are robust to
layout distribution shifts. As a case study we use the task of scientific
document structure recovery, segmenting a scientific paper into its structural
categories (e.g., ""title"", ""caption"", ""reference""). To emulate distribution
shifts that occur in practice we re-partition the GROTOAP2 dataset. We find
that under layout distribution shifts model performance degrades by up to 20
F1. Simple training strategies, such as increasing training diversity, can
reduce this degradation by over 35% relative F1; however, models fail to reach
in-distribution performance in any tested out-of-distribution conditions. This
work highlights the need to consider layout distribution shifts during model
evaluation, and presents a methodology for conducting such evaluations.

terms of the topological data of the mirror Calabi-Yau manifold. The aim of
this work is to characterize the period data near other boundaries in moduli

provide the general form of these periods in a quantized three-cycle basis.
Based on these periods we compute the prepotential and related physical
couplings of the underlying supergravity theory. Moreover, we elucidate the
meaning of the model-dependent coefficients that appear in these expressions:
these can be identified with certain topological and arithmetic numbers
associated to the singular geometry at the moduli space boundary. We illustrate
our findings by studying a wide set of examples.

our simulations confirm the formation of Beltrami-like bulk flows with

that the mean of linking number distribution converges to the global helicity,

characterised by a trade-off between accuracy and resolution. In this study, we
bridge this gap using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) constrained by
the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and accurate sparse
pointwise mean velocity measurements for data assimilation (DA). Firstly, by
constraining the PINN with sparse data and the under-determined RANS equations
without closure, we show that the mean flow is reconstructed to a higher
accuracy than a RANS solver using the Spalart-Allmaras (SA) turbulence model.
Secondly, we propose the SA turbulence model augmented PINN (PINN-DA-SA), which
outperforms the former approach - up to 73% reduction in mean velocity
reconstruction error with coarse measurements. The additional SA physics
constraints improve flow reconstructions in regions with high velocity and
pressure gradients and separation. Thirdly, we compare the PINN-DA-SA approach
to a variational data assimilation using the same sparse velocity measurements

across a range of data resolutions. This is attributed to discretisation errors
in the variational methodology that are avoided by PINNs. We demonstrate the

the evidence for a distinct population of short filaments with PA close to the

concentrated close to the Galactic plane within $60^\circ < \rm PA <120^\circ$.
Remarkably, the short filament PAs are radial with respect to the Galactic

scale, the prominent Sgr E HII complex G358.7-0.0 provides a vivid example of
the nearly radial distribution of short filaments. The bimodal PA distribution
suggests different origin for two distinct filament populations. We argue that
alignment of the short filament population results from the ram pressure of a
degree-scale outflow from Sgr A* that exceeds the internal filament pressure,
and aligns them along the Galactic plane. The ram pressure is estimated to be
2$\times10^6\,$ cm$^{-3}\,$ K at a distance of 300pc, requiring biconical mass
outflow rate $10^{-4}$ \msol\, yr$^{-1}$ with an opening angle of

only 14 steps for high-quality optical plate testing. Optical plate testing
produces an infinite number of simultaneous fringe patterns due to multiple
reflections. However, because of the small reflection of common optical
materials, only a few simultaneous fringes have amplitudes above the measuring
noise. From these fringes, only the variations of the plate's surfaces and
thickness are of interest. To measure these plates, one must use
wavelength-stepping, which corresponds to phase-stepping in standard digital
interferometry. The designed PSA must phase-demodulate a single fringe sequence
and filter out the remaining temporal fringes. In the available literature,
researchers have adapted PSAs to the dimensions of particular plates. As a
consequence, there are as many PSAs published as different testing plate
conditions. Moreover, these PSAs are designed with too many phase-steps to
provide detuning robustness well above the required level. Instead, we
mathematically prove that a single 14-step LS-PSA can adapt to several testing
setups. As is well known, this 14-step LS-PSA has a maximum signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) and the highest harmonics rejection among any other 14-step PSA.
Due to optical dispersion and experimental length measuring errors, the fringes
may have a slight phase detuning. Using propagation error theory, we
demonstrate that measuring distances with around 1% uncertainty produces a
small and acceptable detuning error for the proposed 14-step LS-PSA.

deployment of constellations of satellites in low-Earth orbit. As a result,
physics-based models of the ionosphere and thermosphere have emerged as a
necessary tool for the prediction of atmospheric outputs under highly variable
space weather conditions.
  This paper proposes a high-fidelity approach for physics-based space weather
modeling based on the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations using a
high-order discontinuous Galerkin method, combined with a matrix-free strategy
suitable for high-performance computing on GPU architectures. The approach
consists of a thermospheric model that describes a chemically frozen neutral
atmosphere in non-hydrostatic equilibrium driven by the external excitation of
the Sun. A novel set of variables is considered to treat the low densities
present in the upper atmosphere and to accommodate the wide range of scales
present in the problem. At the same time, and unlike most existing approaches,
radial and angular directions are treated in a non-segregated approach.
  The study presents a set of numerical examples that demonstrate the accuracy
of the approximation and validate the current approach against observational
data along a satellite orbit, including estimates of established empirical and
physics-based models of the ionosphere-thermosphere system. Finally, a 1D
radial derivation of the physics-based model is presented and utilized for
conducting a parametric study of the main thermal quantities under various
solar conditions.

III camera housing by the Apollo 12 astronauts, allowing detailed analysis of
the composition of dust deposited by the LM plume. It was soon realized after
the initial analysis of the camera housing that the LM plume tended to remove
more dust than it had deposited. In the present study, coupons from the camera
housing have been reexamined. In addition, plume effects recorded in landing
videos from each Apollo mission have been studied for possible clues. Several
likely scenarios are proposed to explain the Surveyor III dust observations.
These include electrostatic levitation of the dust from the surface of the Moon
as a result of periodic passing of the day-night terminator; dust blown by the
Apollo 12 LM flyby while on its descent trajectory; dust ejected from the lunar
surface due to gas forced into the soil by the Surveyor III rocket nozzle,
based on Darcy's law; and mechanical movement of dust during the Surveyor

light curves, we find that the inner cluster SNe Ia have a higher fraction of
fast-evolving objects (SALT3 $x_1 < -1$) than the outer cluster or field
quiescent samples. This implies an intrinsically different population of SNe Ia
occurs in inner cluster environments, beyond known correlations based on host

with a fast-evolving component that dominates the inner cluster objects

we analyze the vulnerability of the summarization systems and explore improving
the robustness by data augmentation. Specifically, the first brittleness factor
we found is the poor understanding of infrequent words in the input.
Correspondingly, we feed the encoder with more diverse cases created by
SummAttacker in the input space. The other factor is in the latent space, where
the attacked inputs bring more variations to the hidden states. Hence, we
construct adversarial decoder input and devise manifold softmixing operation in
hidden space to introduce more diversity. Experimental results on Gigaword and

evolution in the country or if it may hide important localized trends. This is
particularly relevant in the scenario where health authorities use information
obtained from such indicators in the design of non-pharmaceutical intervention
policies to control the epidemic. A comparison between R(t) estimates and the
moving average (MA) of daily reported infections is also presented, which is
another commonly monitored variable. The analysis carried out in this paper is

The correlations between the time series of R(t) and MA in different geographic

of correlation are found for the time series of R(t) estimates, compared to the

trends are observed for both indicators, suggesting that local epidemiological
surveillance would be more suitable as an input to the design of

""fallibilism"" for the ""... the doctrine that our knowledge is never absolute
but always swims, as it were, in a continuum of uncertainty and of
indeterminacy"". In terms of scientific practice, this means we are obliged to
reexamine the assumptions, the evidence, and the arguments for conclusions that
subsequent experience has cast into doubt. In this paper we examine an
assumption that underpinned the development of the Internet architecture,
namely that a loosely synchronous point-to-point datagram delivery service
could adequately meet the needs of all network applications, including those
which deliver content and services to a mass audience at global scale. We
examine how the inability of the Networking community to provide a public and
affordable mechanism to support such asynchronous point-to-multipoint
applications led to the development of private overlay infrastructure, namely
CDNs and Cloud networks, whose architecture stands at odds with the Open Data
Networking goals of the early Internet advocates. We argue that the
contradiction between those initial goals and the monopolistic commercial
imperatives of hypergiant overlay infrastructure operators is an important
reason for the apparent contradiction posed by the negative impact of their
most profitable applications (e.g., social media) and strategies (e.g.,
targeted advertisement). We propose that, following the prescription of Peirce,
we can only resolve this contradiction by reconsidering some of our deeply held
assumptions.

competencies in the US Space Force's doctrine document, there is a growing
interest in developing technologies to enable in-space refueling, servicing,

Modeling for space mobility and logistics requires a new approach that differs
from conventional astrodynamics because it needs to consider the coordination
of multiple vehicles to satisfy an overall demand; namely, the optimal
trajectory of one vehicle does not necessarily lead to the optimal campaign
solution that contains multiple vehicles and infrastructure elements. In
addition, for in-space servicing applications, we need additional analysis
capabilities to analyze and optimize the sizes of the fuel/spare depots and
their inventory/sparing policies with orbital mechanics in mind. To tackle
these challenges, there have been various attempts to leverage terrestrial
logistics-driven techniques, coupled with astrodynamics, to enhance in-space
operations; an earlier primary domain of interest was refueling and resource
utilization for human space exploration, and more recent studies focus on
in-space servicing, in-space manufacturing, and mega-scale constellations. This
paper aims to provide a review of the literature by categorizing the

  Wearables-Based Human Activity Recognition",,,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human activity recognition (HAR) in wearable computing is typically based on
direct processing of sensor data. Sensor readings are translated into
representations, either derived through dedicated preprocessing, or integrated
into end-to-end learning. Independent of their origin, for the vast majority of
contemporary HAR, those representations are typically continuous in nature.
That has not always been the case. In the early days of HAR, discretization
approaches have been explored - primarily motivated by the desire to minimize
computational requirements, but also with a view on applications beyond mere
recognition, such as, activity discovery, fingerprinting, or large-scale
search. Those traditional discretization approaches, however, suffer from
substantial loss in precision and resolution in the resulting representations
with detrimental effects on downstream tasks. Times have changed and in this
paper we propose a return to discretized representations. We adopt and apply
recent advancements in Vector Quantization (VQ) to wearables applications,
which enables us to directly learn a mapping between short spans of sensor data
and a codebook of vectors, resulting in recognition performance that is
generally on par with their contemporary, continuous counterparts - sometimes
surpassing them. Therefore, this work presents a proof-of-concept for
demonstrating how effective discrete representations can be derived, enabling
applications beyond mere activity classification but also opening up the field
to advanced tools for the analysis of symbolic sequences, as they are known,
for example, from domains such as natural language processing. Based on an
extensive experimental evaluation on a suite of wearables-based benchmark HAR
tasks, we demonstrate the potential of our learned discretization scheme and
discuss how discretized sensor data analysis can lead to substantial changes in

from the potential application of these defects in modern technologies. A range
of techniques can be employed to create large areas of engineered defects in
LCs, including mechanical shearing, chemical surface treatment, external
fields, or geometric confinement. The technology of 3D printing has recently
emerged as a powerful method to fabricate novel patterning topographies
inaccessible by other microfabrication techniques, especially confining
geometries with curved topographies. In this work, we show the advantages of
using 3D-printed curved surfaces and controlled anchoring properties to confine
LCs and engineer new structures of topological defects, whose structure we
elucidate by comparison with a novel application of Landau-de Gennes free
energy minimization to the smectic A-nematic phase transition. We also
demonstrate the ability of these defects to act as a scaffold for assembling
gold (Au) nanoparticles (NPs) into reconfigurable 3D structures. We discuss the
characteristics of this templated self-assembly (TSA) approach and explain the
relationship between NP concentrations and defect structures with insights
gained from numerical modeling. This work paves the way for a versatile
platform of LC defect-templated assembly of a range of functional nanomaterials
useful in the field of energy technology.

the Infrared Spectrograph on the Spitzer Space Telescope has shown that
absorption by silicates in the 8--11 micron region is seen in most L-type (1300
K to 2200 K) dwarfs. The absorption is caused by silicate-rich clouds in the
atmospheres of L dwarfs and is strongest at L4--L6 spectral types. Herein we
compare averages of the mid-infrared silicate absorption signatures of L3--L7
dwarfs that have low ($\lesssim$10$^{4.5}$ cm s$^{-2}$) vs.\ high
($\gtrsim$10$^5$ cm s$^{-2}$) surface gravity. We find that the silicate
absorption feature is sensitive to surface gravity and indicates a difference
in grain size and composition between dust condensates in young and old mid-L
dwarfs. The mean silicate absorption profile of low-gravity mid-L dwarfs
matches expectations for $\sim$1 micron-sized amorphous iron- and
magnesium-bearing pyroxene (Mg$_x$Fe$_{1-x}$SiO$_3$) grains. High-gravity mid-L
dwarfs have silicate absorption better represented by smaller ($\lesssim$0.1
$\mu$m) and more volatile amorphous enstatite (MgSiO$_3$) or SiO grains. This
is the first direct spectroscopic evidence for gravity-dependent sedimentation
of dust condensates in ultracool atmospheres. It confirms theoretical
expectations for lower sedimentation efficiencies in low-gravity atmospheres
and independently confirms their increased dustiness.

allows us to produce passive controllers with excellent in-band disturbance
attenuation performance at the expense of some of the out-of-band performance.
This paper focuses on control design of linear systems in the presence of
disturbances with non-strictly or non-stationary limited frequency spectrum. We
first propose a class of frequency-dependent excited energy functions (FD-EEF)
as well as frequency-dependent excited power functions (FD-EPF), which possess
a desirable frequency-selectiveness property with regard to the in-band and
out-of-band excited energy as well as excited power of the system. Based upon a
group of frequency-selective passive controllers, we then develop a
frequency-dependent switching control (FDSC) scheme that selects the most
appropriate controller at runtime. We show that our FDSC scheme is capable to
approximate the solid in-band performance while maintaining acceptable
out-of-band performance with regard to global time horizons as well as
localized time horizons. The method is illustrated by a commonly used benchmark
model.

where reward distributions have only finite $(1+v)$-th moments with some $v \in

two frameworks for heavy-tailed MDPs, i.e., one is for value iteration and
another is for policy optimization. Under each framework, we consider both
joint differential privacy (JDP) and local differential privacy (LDP) models.
Based on our frameworks, we provide regret upper bounds for both JDP and LDP

significant impacts on regrets. Finally, we establish a lower bound of regret
minimization for heavy-tailed MDPs in JDP model by reducing it to the
instance-independent lower bound of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits in DP

variational inference (VI) is becoming more and more popular for approximating
intractable posterior distributions in large-scale Bayesian models due to its
comparable efficacy and superior efficiency. Several recent works provide
theoretical justifications of VI by proving its statistical optimality for
parameter estimation under various settings; meanwhile, formal analysis on the
algorithmic convergence aspects of VI is still largely lacking. In this paper,
we consider the common coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) algorithm
for implementing the mean-field (MF) VI towards optimizing a Kullback--Leibler
divergence objective functional over the space of all factorized distributions.
Focusing on the two-block case, we analyze the convergence of CAVI by
leveraging the extensive toolbox from functional analysis and optimization. We
provide general conditions for certifying global or local exponential
convergence of CAVI. Specifically, a new notion of generalized correlation for
characterizing the interaction between the constituting blocks in influencing
the VI objective functional is introduced, which according to the theory,
quantifies the algorithmic contraction rate of two-block CAVI. As

sorting, recognizing Dyck-languages), and NLP tasks including named entity
recognition and text classification. The Transformer Programs can automatically
find reasonable solutions, performing on par with standard Transformers of

compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens,
towards a mixture of low-dimensional Gaussian distributions supported on
incoherent subspaces. The quality of the final representation can be measured
by a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this
perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed
as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally.
Particularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from
alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the
multi-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to
compress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the
subsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the
representation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box
transformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully
interpretable. Despite their simplicity, experiments show that these networks
indeed learn to optimize the designed objective: they compress and sparsify
representations of large-scale real-world vision datasets such as ImageNet, and
achieve performance very close to thoroughly engineered transformers such as
ViT. Code is at \url{https://github.com/Ma-Lab-Berkeley/CRATE}.

three-mirror resonator of alternating layers of ZnS and cryolite with a
PT-symmetric spectral degeneracy of two reflectionless modes. The optical
limiting is demonstrated by measurements of single 532-nm 6-ns laser pulses. At
fluences below 10 mJ/cm2, the multilayer exhibits a flat-top passband at 532

addition to a magnetic field component that is parallel to the shock velocity.
While the linear polarisation computed for on-axis observers is consistent with
previous analytical estimates, we found that lateral expansion, which is
accurately handled in our simulations, plays a crucial role in determining the
linear polarisation for off-axis observers. Our results show that the off-axis
linear polarisation, as seen by off-axis observers, exhibits a single peak, in
contrast to the two peaks inferred by previous analytical studies. The maximum
polarisation degree is 40\% at an observing angle $\theta_{\rm obs}=0.4$ rad,
and it decreases as the observing angle increases, which is opposite to what
predicted by analytical models, where polarisation increases with larger
observing angles. From the upper limit of 12\% in the linear polarisation

opportunities for both IoT and XR to converge toward hybrid XR objects with
strong real-world connectivity, and IoT objects with rich XR interfaces. The
paper contributes i) an understanding of this multi-disciplinary domain XR-IoT

realize the coupling, suitable transmission conditions on the interface between
the two domains are (weakly) embedded in the formulation. The proposed PolydG

despite the fact that all weight parameters are updated throughout training.
This simplicity in learning dynamics could have significant implications for
both efficient training and a better understanding of deep networks. First, the
analysis enables us to considerably improve training efficiency by taking
advantage of the low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. We can
construct smaller, equivalent deep linear networks without sacrificing the
benefits associated with the wider counterparts. Second, it allows us to better

applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling
quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While
many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce
the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by
implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over
the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions
often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full
attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend
FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns

This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a
multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low

their illnesses. The aim of our study was to investigate the use of Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to identify the spoken content of YouTube vlogs
related to the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) for public
health screening. Methods: COVID-19 videos on YouTube were searched using
relevant keywords. A total of 1000 videos being spoken in English were
downloaded out of which 791 were classified as vlogs, 192 were non-vlogs, and
17 were deleted by the channel. The videos were converted into a textual format
using Microsoft Streams. The textual data was preprocessed using basic and
advanced preprocessing methods. A lexicon of 200 words was created which
contained words related to COVID-19. The data was analyzed using topic
modeling, word clouds, and lexicon matching. Results: The word cloud results
revealed discussions about COVID-19 symptoms like ""fever"", along with generic
terms such as ""mask"" and ""isolation"". Lexical analysis demonstrated that in
96.46% of videos, patients discussed generic terms, and in 95.45% of videos,
people talked about COVID-19 symptoms. LDA Topic Modeling results also
generated topics that successfully captured key themes and content related to

structure change in a selected region during a 20 ns voltage pulse, showing how
a charge density wave transition evolves during and after the applied field.
Then, time-resolved nanoimaging is demonstrated, revealing heterogeneous

First, our system directly operates on raw fisheye images, enabling us to fully
exploit the wide Field-of-View (FoV) of fisheye cameras. Second, to overcome
the low-texture challenge, we explore the tightly-coupled integration of
multi-camera inputs and complementary inertial measurements via a unified
factor graph and jointly optimize the poses and dense depth maps. Third, for
global consistency, the wide FoV of the fisheye camera allows the system to
find more potential loop closures, and powered by the broad convergence basin
of RFT, our system can perform very wide baseline loop closing with little
overlap. Furthermore, we introduce a semi-pose-graph BA method to avoid the
expensive full global BA. By combining relative pose factors with loop closure
factors, the global states can be adjusted efficiently with modest memory
footprint while maintaining high accuracy. Evaluations on TUM-VI, Hilti-Oxford

small-scales is marginalized to obtain the deterministic evolution of the LES

latent neural SDE to model the evolution of the stochastic process and an
encoder-decoder pair for transforming between the latent space and the desired

parameterization of closure models where each trajectory is treated as a

approach (niLES - neural ideal LES) on a challenging chaotic dynamical system:
Kolmogorov flow at a Reynolds number of 20,000. Compared to competing methods,

models are trained with a single hardware instance, whose performance is
vulnerable to hardware perturbation or replacement, demonstrating an
overfitting issue to the physical configuration. This defect limits the
deployment of pre-trained models since they would suffer from large performance
degradation when are assembled to unseen hardware. To better facilitate the
reconstruction model with new hardware, previous efforts resort to centralized
training by collecting multi-hardware and data, which is impractical when
dealing with proprietary assets among institutions. In light of this, federated
learning (FL) has become a feasible solution to enable cross-hardware
cooperation without breaking privacy. However, the naive FedAvg is subject to
client drift upon data heterogeneity owning to the hardware inconsistency. In
this work, we tackle this challenge by marrying prompt tuning with FL to
snapshot compressive imaging for the first time and propose an federated
hardware-prompt learning (FedHP) method. Rather than mitigating the client
drift by rectifying the gradients, which only takes effect on the learning
manifold but fails to touch the heterogeneity rooted in the input data space,
the proposed FedHP globally learns a hardware-conditioned prompter to align the

quasi-two dimensions, in order to gain insights into the aligning mechanisms at
work in these gliding assay systems. We find that, without aligning torques in
the microscopic model, long-range orientational order can only be achieved when
the filaments are able to overlap. The symmetry (nematic or polar) of the
long-range order that first emerges is shown to depend on the energy cost of
filament overlap and on filament flexibility. However, our model also predicts
that a long-range-ordered active nematic state is merely transient, whereas
long-range polar order is the only active dynamical steady state in systems
with finite filament rigidity.

  Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transfer learning has become an increasingly popular technique in machine
learning as a way to leverage a pretrained model trained for one task to assist
with building a finetuned model for a related task. This paradigm has been
especially popular for privacy in machine learning, where the pretrained model
is considered public, and only the data for finetuning is considered sensitive.
However, there are reasons to believe that the data used for pretraining is
still sensitive, making it essential to understand how much information the
finetuned model leaks about the pretraining data. In this work we propose a new
membership-inference threat model where the adversary only has access to the
finetuned model and would like to infer the membership of the pretraining data.
To realize this threat model, we implement a novel metaclassifier-based attack,
TMI, that leverages the influence of memorized pretraining samples on
predictions in the downstream task. We evaluate TMI on both vision and natural
language tasks across multiple transfer learning settings, including finetuning
with differential privacy. Through our evaluation, we find that TMI can
successfully infer membership of pretraining examples using query access to the
finetuned model.

Maxwell's equations on unstructured grids efficiently. Similar to the

explicit time-stepping without solving linear systems. The method is
constructed by algebraic reduction of another underlying finite element scheme
which involves two degrees of freedom for every edge. Mass-lumping and
additional modifications are used in the construction of this method to allow
for the mentioned algebraic reduction in the presence of source terms and lossy

which by construction also carries over to the reduced scheme and allows to
prove convergence rates for the latter. The efficiency and accuracy of both

applications in topological data analysis and visualization of scientific data.
Recently, Munch and Stefanou introduced a labeled interleaving distance for
comparing two labeled merge trees, which enjoys a number of theoretical and
algorithmic properties. In particular, the labeled interleaving distance
between merge trees can be computed in polynomial time. In this work, we define
the labeled interleaving distance for labeled Reeb graphs. We then prove that
the (ordinary) interleaving distance between Reeb graphs equals the minimum of
the labeled interleaving distance over all labelings. We also provide an
efficient algorithm for computing the labeled interleaving distance between two
labeled contour trees (which are special types of Reeb graphs that arise from
simply-connected domains). In the case of merge trees, the notion of the
labeled interleaving distance was used by Gasparovic et al. to prove that the
(ordinary) interleaving distance on the set of (unlabeled) merge trees is
intrinsic. As our final contribution, we present counterexamples showing that,
on the contrary, the (ordinary) interleaving distance on (unlabeled) Reeb

estimates of key VCA QoE metrics such as frames rate and video resolution. We
develop a method that uses machine learning with a combination of flow

of materials based on both experiment and theoretical works. Chiral
superconductors host a finite Chern number set by the winding of the
superconducting order parameter and associated topologically protected chiral
edge modes. However, the chiral edge currents and orbital angular momentum
(OAM) generated by the edge modes are not topologically protected and another,
more robust, experimental probe is therefore needed to facilitate experimental
verification of chiral $d$-wave superconductors. We have recently shown the
appearance of quadruply quantized coreless vortices (CVs) in chiral $d$-wave
superconductors, consisting of a closed domain wall decorated with eight
fractional vortices, and generating a smoking-gun signature of the Chern
number, chirality, and the superconducting pairing symmetry [P. Holmvall and A.
M. Black-Schaffer, arXiv:2212.08156 (2023)]. Specifically, the CV spontaneously
breaks axial symmetry for parallel chirality and vorticity, with a signature
appearing directly in the local density of states (LDOS) measurable with
scanning-tunneling spectroscopy (STS). In this work, we first demonstrate a
strong tunability of the CV size and shape directly reflected in the LDOS and
then show that the LDOS signature is robust in the presence of regular
Abrikosov vortices, strong confinement, system and normal-state anisotropy,
different Fermi surfaces (FSs), non-degenerate order parameters, and even
non-magnetic impurities. In conclusion, our work establishes CVs as a tunable
and robust signature of chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

congestion reduction for mobile robots navigation without inter-robot

that can provide optimal paths from distinct topological classes available in
the underlying configuration space. However, these methods usually require
non-trivial and non-universal geometrical constructions, which are
prohibitively complex or expensive in 3 or higher dimensional configuration
spaces with complex topology. Furthermore, topological methods are unable to
distinguish between locally optimal paths that belong to the same topological
class but are distinct because of genus-zero obstacles in 3D or due to
high-cost or high-curvature regions. In this paper we propose an universal and
generalized approach to multi-class path planning using the concept of a novel
neighborhood-augmented graph, search-based planning in which can compute paths
in distinct topo-geometric classes. This approach can find desired number of
locally optimal paths in a wider variety of configuration spaces without
requiring any complex pre-processing or geometric constructions. Unlike the
existing topological methods, resulting optimal paths are not restricted to
distinct topological classes, thus making the algorithm applicable to many
other problems where locally optimal and geometrically distinct paths are of
interest. For the demonstration of an application of the proposed approach, we
implement our algorithm to planning for shortest traversible paths for a
tethered robot with cable-length constraint navigating in 3D and validate it in

  Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Asynchronous federated learning aims to solve the straggler problem in
heterogeneous environments, i.e., clients have small computational capacities
that could cause aggregation delay. The principle of asynchronous federated
learning is to allow the server to aggregate the model once it receives an
update from any client rather than waiting for updates from multiple clients or
waiting a specified amount of time in the synchronous mode. Due to the
asynchronous setting, the stale model problem could occur, where the slow
clients could utilize an outdated local model for their local data training.
Consequently, when these locally trained models are uploaded to the server,
they may impede the convergence of the global training. Therefore, effective
model aggregation strategies play a significant role in updating the global
model. Besides, client scheduling is also critical when heterogeneous clients
with diversified computing capacities are participating in the federated
learning process. This work first investigates the impact of the convergence of
asynchronous federated learning mode when adopting the aggregation coefficient
in synchronous mode. The effective aggregation solutions that can achieve the
same convergence result as in the synchronous mode are then proposed, followed
by an improved aggregation method with client scheduling. The simulation
results in various scenarios demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges
with a similar level of accuracy as the classical synchronous federated
learning algorithm but effectively accelerates the learning process, especially

However, accurately predicting which patients will respond to CRT remains a
challenge. This study explores the application of deep transfer learning
techniques to train a predictive model for CRT response. Methods: In this
study, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) technique was employed to
transform ECG signals into two-dimensional images. A transfer learning approach
was then applied on the MIT-BIT ECG database to pre-train a convolutional
neural network (CNN) model. The model was fine-tuned to extract relevant
features from the ECG images, and then tested on our dataset of CRT patients to
predict their response. Results: Seventy-one CRT patients were enrolled in this
study. The transfer learning model achieved an accuracy of 72% in
distinguishing responders from non-responders in the local dataset.
Furthermore, the model showed good sensitivity (0.78) and specificity (0.79) in

utilization of ECG images as input and leveraging the power of transfer

measurement primes respondents to react differently to the treatment. This
paper formally analyzes this trade-off between post-treatment and priming
biases in three experimental designs that vary when moderators are measured:
pre-treatment, post-treatment, or a randomized choice between the two. We
derive nonparametric bounds for interactions between the treatment and the
moderator in each design and show how to use substantive assumptions to narrow
these bounds. These bounds allow researchers to assess the sensitivity of their
empirical findings to either source of bias. We extend the basic framework in
two ways. First, we apply the framework to the case of post-treatment attention
checks and bound how much inattentive respondents can attenuate estimated
treatment effects. Second, we develop a parametric Bayesian approach to
incorporate pre-treatment covariates in the analysis to sharpen our inferences
and quantify estimation uncertainty. We apply these methods to a survey
experiment on electoral messaging. We conclude with practical recommendations

Linked Gaussian process (LGP) emulation tackles this challenge through a

individual computer models in a network. However, the required stationarity of
the component Gaussian process emulators within the LGP framework limits its
applicability in many real-world applications. In this work, we conceptualize a
network of computer models as a deep Gaussian process with partial exposure of
its hidden layers. We develop a method for inference for these partially
exposed deep networks that retains a key strength of the LGP framework, whereby
each model can be emulated separately using a DGP and then linked together. We
show in both synthetic and empirical examples that our linked deep Gaussian
process emulators exhibit significantly better predictive performance than
standard LGP emulators in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
They also outperform single DGPs fitted to the network as a whole because they
are able to integrate information from the partially exposed hidden layers. Our

ALAVI in the current paper, for solving a general constrained VI model. Under
an assumption, to be called the primal-dual variational coherence condition in
the paper, we prove the convergence of ALAVI. Next, we show that many existing
generalized monotonicity properties are sufficient -- though by no means
necessary -- to imply the above mentioned coherence condition, thus are
sufficient to ensure convergence of ALAVI. Under that assumption, we further
show that ALAVI has in fact an $o(1/\sqrt{k})$ global rate of convergence where
$k$ is the iteration count. By introducing a new gap function, this rate
further improves to be $O(1/k)$ if the mapping is monotone. Finally, we show
that under a metric subregularity condition, even if the VI model may be
non-monotone the local convergence rate of ALAVI improves to be linear.
Numerical experiments on some randomly generated highly nonlinear and
non-monotone VI problems show practical efficacy of the newly proposed method.

when the angular separation is greater than 3--4$\times 10^{-1}\lambda/D$. For
sub-$\lambda/D$ separated sources, the peak positions (obtained with Gaussian
fitting) of the output point spread functions are different from the angular

$1.0\lambda/D$ as the angular separation of the light source varies from
$0.1\lambda/D$ to $1.0\lambda/D$. The off-axis throughput including the
fiber-coupling efficiency (with respect to no focal plane mask) is about 40%

While semi-supervised learning has shown promise in FER, most current methods
from general computer vision literature have not been explored in the context

unconstrained learning. Our results demonstrate that FixMatch consistently
achieves better performance on in-distribution unlabelled data, while

semi-supervised learning produces a reasonable improvement over supervised

recovered intensity images. Our portable pol-CP prototype can resolve the
435-nm linewidth on the resolution target and the imaging field of view for a
single acquisition is limited only by the detector size of 41 mm^2. The
prototype allows for the acquisition of gigapixel birefringence images with a
180-mm^2 field of view in ~3.5 minutes, achieving an imaging throughput
comparable to that of a conventional whole slide scanner. To demonstrate its
biomedical applications, we perform high-throughput imaging of malaria-infected

birefringence maps of label-free thyroid smears to identify thyroid follicles.

become an increasingly important challenge of machine learning when applied in
practice. Existing distributed learning paradigms, such as Federated Learning,
enable this via model aggregation which enforces a strong form of modeling
homogeneity and synchronicity across clients. This is however not suitable to
many practical scenarios. For example, in distributed sensing, heterogeneous
sensors reading data from different views of the same phenomenon would need to
use different models for different data modalities. Local learning therefore
happens in isolation but inference requires merging the local models to achieve
consensus. To enable consensus among local models, we propose a feature fusion
approach that extracts local representations from local models and incorporates
them into a global representation that improves the prediction performance.
Achieving this requires addressing two non-trivial problems. First, we need to
learn an alignment between similar feature components which are arbitrarily
arranged across clients to enable representation aggregation. Second, we need
to learn a consensus graph that captures the high-order interactions between
local feature spaces and how to combine them to achieve a better prediction.

real-world applications on time series data such as power grids and traffic

propose CREST, the first scalable framework with rigorous theoretical
guarantees to identify the most valuable examples for training non-convex
models, particularly deep networks. To guarantee convergence to a stationary
point of a non-convex function, CREST models the non-convex loss as a series of
quadratic functions and extracts a coreset for each quadratic sub-region. In
addition, to ensure faster convergence of stochastic gradient methods such as
(mini-batch) SGD, CREST iteratively extracts multiple mini-batch coresets from
larger random subsets of training data, to ensure nearly-unbiased gradients
with small variances. Finally, to further improve scalability and efficiency,
CREST identifies and excludes the examples that are learned from the coreset
selection pipeline. Our extensive experiments on several deep networks trained
on vision and NLP datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, and
SNLI, confirm that CREST speeds up training deep networks on very large
datasets, by 1.7x to 2.5x with minimum loss in the performance. By analyzing
the learning difficulty of the subsets selected by CREST, we show that deep
models benefit the most by learning from subsets of increasing difficulty
levels.

absorption clouds, which are found to be located $2.7^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$ kpc away,
just beyond the Perseus Arm. We also obtain a direct distance estimation of the

that PSR B0458+46 should be located beyond the Perseus Arm, with a lower limit

efficiently training models of code with less human effort has become an
emergent problem. Active learning is such a technique to address this issue
that allows developers to train a model with reduced data while producing
models with desired performance, which has been well studied in computer vision

paper, we bridge this gap by building the first benchmark to study this
critical problem - active code learning. Specifically, we collect 11
acquisition functions~(which are used for data selection in active learning)
from existing works and adapt them for code-related tasks. Then, we conduct an
empirical study to check whether these acquisition functions maintain
performance for code data. The results demonstrate that feature selection
highly affects active learning and using output vectors to select data is the
best choice. For the code summarization task, active code learning is
ineffective which produces models with over a 29.64\% gap compared to the
expected performance. Furthermore, we explore future directions of active code

prediction uncertainty to identify critical areas for informative data
collection. Gaussian Processes (GPs) with stationary kernels have been widely
adopted for spatial modeling. However, real-world spatial data is typically
non-stationary -- different locations do not have the same degree of
variability. As a result, the prediction uncertainty does not accurately reveal
prediction error, limiting the success of RIG algorithms. We propose a family
of non-stationary kernels named Attentive Kernel (AK), which is simple, robust,
and can extend any existing kernel to a non-stationary one. We evaluate the new
kernel in elevation mapping tasks, where AK provides better accuracy and
uncertainty quantification over the commonly used stationary kernels and the
leading non-stationary kernels. The improved uncertainty quantification guides
the downstream informative planner to collect more valuable data around the
high-error area, further increasing prediction accuracy. A field experiment

unexplored. In this paper, through extensive empirical studies, we identify
current multimodal classification methods suffer from unreliable predictive

Specifically, we find that the confidence estimated by current models could
even increase when some modalities are corrupted. To address the issue, we
introduce an intuitive principle for multimodal learning, i.e., the confidence

interest as per an existing sequence interaction of items, has attracted
growing applications of Contrastive Learning (CL) with improved user and item
representations. However, these contrastive objectives: (1) serve a similar
role as the cross-entropy loss while ignoring the item representation space
optimisation; and (2) commonly require complicated modelling, including complex
positive/negative sample constructions and extra data augmentation. In this
work, we introduce Self-Contrastive Learning (SCL), which simplifies the
application of CL and enhances the performance of state-of-the-art CL-based
recommendation techniques. Specifically, SCL is formulated as an objective
function that directly promotes a uniform distribution among item
representations and efficiently replaces all the existing contrastive objective
components of state-of-the-art models. Unlike previous works, SCL eliminates
the need for any positive/negative sample construction or data augmentation,
leading to enhanced interpretability of the item representation space and
facilitating its extensibility to existing recommender systems. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that SCL consistently
improves the performance of state-of-the-art models with statistical
significance. Notably, our experiments show that SCL improves the performance
of two best-performing models by 8.2% and 9.5% in P@10 (Precision) and 9.9% and
11.2% in MRR@10 (Mean Reciprocal Rank) on average across different benchmarks.
Additionally, our analysis elucidates the improvement in terms of alignment and
uniformity of representations, as well as the effectiveness of SCL with a low
computational cost.

dramatically different than degree sets of curves over finitely generated

cylindrical black hole (or black string) spacetime that is surrounded by a thin
shell rotating synchronously with the black string's axis. The existence of the
thin shell leads to a piecewise metric of the black hole spacetime beyond the
horizon, which is divided into two stationary spacetime parts by the radius of
the thin shell. As a result, the potential function $V(r)$ of the QNM equation
is also discontinuous. To solve the QNM equation with the discontinuous
potential function, we propose two methods, matrix method and generalized
Horowitz-Hubeny Method. We find that the influence of the thin shell can reduce
the QNM frequency of the black string while alleviating their amplitude decay
rate. Our suggested method can be easily applied to other QNM calculations of
black hole spacetime with discontinuous potential function, thus facilitating
investigations into more intricate and realistic black hole spacetimes, such as
those with accretion disks. Additionally, the finite difference method is
employed to investigate the spacetime too. This analysis discloses a
substantial gap in the potential function when the thin shell's mass and charge
achieve sufficiently high values, resulting in the outer spacetime nearing
gravitational collapse and extreme black hole scenarios. Within this gap, the
QNM wave displays oscillations, producing an echo effect. Moreover, it is
established that the closeness of the spacetime to the collapse threshold and
charge extremality have positive correlation with the beat interval of this

us exploring what mechanism leads to both $\textit{clean generalization and

First, we propose a theoretical framework of adversarial training, where we
analyze $\textit{feature learning process}$ to explain how adversarial training
leads network learner to CGRO regime. Specifically, we prove that, under our
patch-structured dataset, the CNN model provably partially learns the true

  Our main results are four-fold: (i)~without appropriate policy, the shocked
economy can take years to recover, or even tip over into a deep recession;
(ii)~the response to policy is non-monotonic, leading to a narrow window of
``optimal'' policy responses due to the trade-off between inflation and
unemployment; (iii)~the success of monetary policy in curbing inflation is
primarily due to expectation anchoring, rather than to direct impact of
interest rate hikes; (iv)~the two most sensitive model parameters are those

experimentally by shadowgraphy and particle image velocimetry techniques. In
swirl flow, the droplet experiences oppose-flow, cross-flow, and co-flow
conditions depending on its ejection location, the velocity of the airstream,
and swirl strength, which results in distinct droplet morphologies as compared
to the straight airflow situation. We observe a new breakup phenomenon, termed
as `retracting bag breakup', as the droplet encounters a differential flow
field created by the wake of the swirler's vanes and the central recirculation
zone in swirl airflow. A regime map demarcating the various modes, such as no
breakup, vibrational breakup, retracting bag breakup, and bag breakup modes, is
presented for different sets of dimensionless parameters influencing the
droplet morphology and its trajectory. In contrast to the straight flow, the
swirl flow promotes the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,
enhancing the stretching factor in the droplet deformation process, resulting
in a larger number of fingers on the droplet's surface. In order to gain
physical insight, a modified theoretical analysis based on the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability is proposed for the swirl flow. The experimental behaviour of
droplet deformation phenomena in swirl flow conditions can be determined by
modifying the stretching factor in the theoretical model.

flat peak followed by a rapid decline. We present theoretical light curves for
CN Cha, based on hydrostatic approximation, and estimate the white dwarf (WD)
mass to be $\sim 0.6 ~M_\odot$ for a low metal abundance of Z = 0.004. This
kind of flat peak novae are border objects between classical novae having a
sharp optical peak and extremely slow novae, the evolutions of which are too
slow to be recognized as a nova outburst in human timescale. Theoretically,
there are two types of nova envelope solutions, static and optically-thick
wind, in low mass WDs ($\lesssim 0.7 ~M_\odot$). Such a nova outburst begins
first in a hydrostatic manner, and later it could change to an optically-thick
wind evolution due to perturbation by the companion star in the nova envelope.
Multiple peaks are a reflection of the relaxation process of transition. CN Cha
supports our explanation on the difference between long-lasted flat peak novae
like CN Cha and multiple peak novae like V723 Cas, because the companion star
is located far outside, and does not perturb, the nova envelope in CN Cha.

discretization of the Piano-mover's problem into a 3D volume of 2D position

edges to six neighbors each, we have three vertices with a total of ten edges,
increasing the graph size by less than a factor of two, and this factor does

Minimization (IRM) and its FL equivalent, dubbed FL Games, we solve the RIS
configuration problem by learning invariant causal representations across
multiple environments and then predicting the phases. The solution corresponds
to playing according to Best Response Dynamics (BRD) which yields the Nash
Equilibrium of the FL game. The representation learner and the phase predictor
are modeled by two neural networks, and their performance is validated via
simulations against other benchmarks from the literature. Our results show that
causality-based learning yields a predictor that is 15% more accurate in unseen
Out-of-Distribution (OoD) environments.

we show that STAR-RIS can significantly outperform a regular RIS when the
regular RIS cannot cover all the users. We also show that RS can highly

and are being commercialized. A Level 3 ADS prompts the driver to take control
by requesting to intervene (RtI) when its operational design domain (ODD) or
system limitations are exceeded. However, complex traffic situations may lead
drivers to perceive multiple potential triggers of RtI simultaneously, causing
hesitation or confusion during take-over. Therefore, drivers must clearly
understand the ADS's system limitations to understand the triggers of RtI and
ensure safe take-over. In this study, we propose a voice-based HMI for
providing RtI trigger cues to help drivers understand ADS's system limitations.
The results of a between-group experiment using a driving simulator showed that
incorporating effective trigger cues into the RtI enabled drivers to comprehend
the ADS's system limitations better and reduce collisions. It also improved the
subjective evaluations of drivers, such as the comprehensibility of system
limitations, hesitation in response to RtI, and acceptance of ADS behaviors
when encountering RtI while using the ADS. Therefore, enhanced comprehension

the low-frequency oscillator which controls the slowly time-varying nature of

transfer function based on typical analog phaser circuit topology. We show that
the model can be trained to emulate an analog reference device, while retaining
interpretable and adjustable parameters. The frame duration is an important

two geometries inspired by pulsar and magnetar magnetospheres, namely the

the frequency vs. time plane (dynamic spectrum). This envelope notably
characterises spectral occupancy and frequency drifts (both burst-to-burst and

pattern of the object scene coherently in the focal plane of the imaging system

resolution, which can be reached, depends on one hand on the wavelength of the
radiation, but also on the capability to measure - in the focal plane - Fourier
components with high spatial wave-vectors. This leads to a conflicting
situation at THz frequencies, because choosing a shorter wavelength for better
resolution usually comes at the cost of less radiation power, concomitant with
a loss of dynamic range, which limits the detection of higher Fourier
components. Here, aiming at maintaining a high dynamic range and limiting the
system costs, we adopt heterodyne detection at the 2nd sub-harmonic, working
with continuous-wave (CW) radiation for object illumination at 600 GHz and
local-oscillator (LO) radiation at 300 GHz. The detector is a single-pixel
broad-band Si CMOS TeraFET equipped with substrate lenses on both the front-

illuminated by the object wave, and the Fourier spectrum is recorded by raster
scanning of the single detector unit through the focal plane. With only 56 uW
of power of the 600-GHz radiation, a dynamic range of 60 dB is reached,
sufficient to detect the entire accessible Fourier space spectrum in the test
measurements. A lateral spatial resolution of better than 0.5 mm, at the

of the annotator preference and stochastic error, which are modeled by
convolution blocks located after decoder and pixel-wise independent Gaussian
distribution, respectively. It is unlikely that convolution blocks can
effectively model the varying degrees of preference at the full resolution
level. Additionally, the independent pixel-wise Gaussian distribution
disregards pixel correlations, leading to a discontinuous boundary. This paper
proposes a Transformer-based Annotation Bias-aware (TAB) medical image
segmentation model, which tackles the annotator-related bias via modeling
annotator preference and stochastic errors. TAB employs the Transformer with
learnable queries to extract the different preference-focused features. This
enables TAB to produce segmentation with various preferences simultaneously
using a single segmentation head. Moreover, TAB takes the multivariant normal
distribution assumption that models pixel correlations, and learns the
annotation distribution to disentangle the stochastic error. We evaluated our
TAB on an OD/OC segmentation benchmark annotated by six annotators. Our results
suggest that TAB outperforms existing medical image segmentation models which

the modeling conundrum from distribution discrepancy across different scenes.
To remedy this, we first explore relationships between diverse low-light scenes

paradigm to model the above latent correspondence from the perspective of
hyperparameter optimization. A bilevel learning framework is constructed to
endow the scene-irrelevant generality of the encoder towards diverse scenes

$\psi$-Hilfer fractional derivatives with state-dependent control constraints
and optimal control for a particular type of cost functional. Then, we
investigate the approximate controllability of the abstract fractional
semilinear differential inclusion involving $\psi$-Hilfer fractional derivative
in reflexive Banach spaces. It is known that the existence, uniqueness, optimal
control, and approximate controllability of fractional differential equations
or inclusions have been demonstrated for a similar type of fractional
differential equations or inclusions with different fractional order derivative
operators. Hence it has to research fractional differential equations with more
general fractional operators which incorporate all the specific fractional
derivative operators. This motivates us to consider the $\psi$-Hilfer
fractional differential inclusion. We assume the compactness of the
corresponding semigroup and the approximate controllability of the associated
linear control system and define the control with the help of duality mapping.
We observe that convexity is essential in determining the controllability
property of semilinear differential inclusion. In the case of Hilbert spaces,
there is no issue of convexity as the duality map becomes simply the identity
map. In contrast to Hilbert spaces, if we consider reflexive Banach spaces,
there is an issue of convexity due to the nonlinear nature of duality mapping.
The novelty of this paper is that we overcome this convexity issue and
establish our main result. Finally, we test our outcomes through an example.

computed tomography (CT) scans in childhood. The health effects of ionizing
radiation are then estimated from the absorbed dose to the organs of interest
which is calculated, for each CT scan, from dosimetric numerical models, like
the one proposed in the NCICT software. Given that a dosimetric model depends
on input parameters which are most often uncertain, the calculation of absorbed
doses is inherently uncertain. A current methodological challenge in radiation
epidemiology is thus to be able to account for dose uncertainty in risk
estimation. A preliminary important step can be to identify the most
influential input parameters implied in dose estimation, before modelling and
accounting for their related uncertainty in radiation-induced health risks
estimates. In this work, a variance-based global sensitivity analysis was
performed to rank by influence the uncertain input parameters of the NCICT

classes of CT examinations. Two recent sensitivity indices, especially adapted
to the case of dependent input parameters, were estimated, namely: the Shapley
effects and the Proportional Marginal Effects (PME). This provides a first
comparison of the respective behavior and usefulness of these two indices on a
real medical application case. The conclusion is that Shapley effects and PME
are intrinsically different, but complementary. Interestingly, we also observed
that the proportional redistribution property of the PME allowed for a clearer
importance hierarchy between the input parameters.

considering abundant recurrent connections in the mouse visual system, we
design a recurrent module based on the hierarchy of the mouse cortex and add it
into Deep Spiking Neural Networks, which have been demonstrated to be a more
compelling computational model for the visual cortex. Using Time-Series
Representational Similarity Analysis, we measure the representational
similarity between networks and mouse cortical regions under natural movie

highest representational similarity and significantly outperforms feedforward

the increase of surface temperature after sunrise and usually reached its
maximum value in the afternoon around 18:00, then rapidly decreased until
sunset. (2) The average ABLH in April was the highest at about 1200 m, while it

the development of downstream applications using generative models ranging from
data augmentation over image and video generation to anomaly detection. Despite
publicly available trained models, their potential to be used for privacy
preserving data sharing has not been fully explored yet. Training diffusion
models on private data and disseminating the models and weights rather than the
raw dataset paves the way for innovative large-scale data-sharing strategies,
particularly in healthcare, where safeguarding patients' personal health
information is paramount. However, publishing such models without individual
consent of, e.g., the patients from whom the data was acquired, necessitates
guarantees that identifiable training samples will never be reproduced, thus
protecting personal health data and satisfying the requirements of policymakers
and regulatory bodies. This paper introduces a method for estimating the upper
bound of the probability of reproducing identifiable training images during the
sampling process. This is achieved by designing an adversarial approach that
searches for anatomic fingerprints, such as medical devices or dermal art,
which could potentially be employed to re-identify training images. Our method
harnesses the learned score-based model to estimate the probability of the
entire subspace of the score function that may be utilized for one-to-one
reproduction of training samples. To validate our estimates, we generate
anomalies containing a fingerprint and investigate whether generated samples
from trained generative models can be uniquely mapped to the original training
samples. Overall our results show that privacy-breaching images are reproduced
at sampling time if the models were trained without care.

be represented from the distributional discrepancies characterized by the
completion models, which are stable, generalized, and robust for detecting
unknown fake patterns. Then, a multi-view classification is devised with
elaborated intra- and inter-view learning strategies to enhance view-specific

the nuclear quantum effects in $LaH_{10}$ should be significant and have an
impact on its various physical properties. Here, we adopt the method combines
deep-potential (DP) and quantum thermal bath (QTB), which was verified to be
able to account for quantum effects in high-accuracy large-scale molecular
dynamics simulations. Our method can actually reproduce pressure-temperature
phase diagrams of $LaH_{10}$ consistent with experimental and theoretical
results. After incorporating quantum effects, the quantum fluctuation driven
diffusion of proton is found even in the absence of thermal fluctuation near 0
K. The high mobility of proton is found to be compared to liquid, yet the
structure of $LaH_{10}$ is still rigid. These results would greatly enrich our
vision to study quantum behavior of hydrogen-rich superconductors.

observed link between two a priori unrelated notions: firstly the dynamical
degree of the mapping and secondly the evolution of parameters required for its
singularity structure to remain unchanged under a sufficiently general
deautonomisation. We give a proof of this conjectured correspondence for a
large class of birational mappings of the plane via the spaces of initial
conditions for their deautonomised versions. We show that even for
non-integrable mappings in this class, the surfaces forming these spaces have
effective anticanonical divisors and one can define a kind of period map
similar to that in the theory of rational surfaces associated with discrete
Painlev\'e equations. This provides a bridge between the evolution of
coefficients in the deautonomised mapping and the induced dynamics on the
Picard lattice which encode the dynamical degree.

Existing FCD detection methods are limited by high numbers of false positive

segmentation using graph convolutional networks (GCN), which allows our model
to learn spatial relationships between brain regions. To address the specific
challenges of FCD identification, our proposed model includes an auxiliary loss
to predict distance from the lesion to reduce false positives and a weak
supervision classification loss to facilitate learning from uncertain lesion

features and manual lesion masks from structural MRI data, the proposed GCN
achieved an AUC of 0.74, a significant improvement against a previously used
vertex-wise multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier (AUC 0.64). With
sensitivity thresholded at 67%, the GCN had a specificity of 71% in comparison

solution in renormalizable quantum gravity that asymptotically indicates
background freedom represented by a special conformal invariance. Inflation
ignites at the Planck scale and continues until spacetime phase transition
occurs at a dynamical scale about $10^{17}$GeV. We can show that during
inflation, the initially large scale-invariant fluctuations reduce in amplitude
to the appropriate magnitude suggested by tiny CMB anisotropies. The goal of
this research is to derive spectra of fluctuations at the phase transition
point, that is, the primordial spectra. A system of nonlinear evolution
equations for the fluctuations is derived from the quantum gravity effective
action. The running coupling constant is then expressed by a time-dependent
average following the spirit of the mean field approximation. In this paper, we
determine and examine various nonlinear terms, not treated in previous studies
such as the exponential factor of the conformal mode, that contribute at the
early stage of inflation with still large amplitude. Moreover, in order to
verify their effects concretely, we numerically solve the evolution equation by
making a simplification to extract the most contributing parts of the terms in
comoving momentum space. The result indicates that they serve to maintain the
initial scale invariance over a wide range beyond the comoving Planck scale.
This is a challenge toward derivation of the precise primordial spectra, and we
expect in the future that it will lead to the resolution of the tensions that
have arisen in cosmology.

infrared thermal imager. Firstly, in order to determine the inverse heat flux
solving method, a physical model based on the geometric characteristics of the
RDC is constructed and its thermal conductive process is simulated, given by
different heat flux boundary conditions. Then the wall heat fluxes are
inversely calculated by the Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) method based on the above
numerical data. Results show that the L-M method can obtain more accurate heat
flux distribution even in the zones with large heat flux gradients, considering
the axial heat conduction within the combustor outer wall caused by the
non-uniform heat flux. Finally, the wall heat flux distribution is analyzed
coupling the L-M method together with the experimental measurements in kerosene
two-phase RDC. The analyses show that the highest temperature of combustor
outer surface and the highest wall heat flux occurs within the region of 20mm
from the combustor head, which corresponds to nearly 14% of the combustor
length. With the increase of axial distance, the heat flux is rapidly reduced,
and then the heat flux distribution is more uniform at the downstream region of
the combustor. The heat flux peak and thermal heat rate are positively
correlated with the combustor equivalence ratio in the range between 0.44 and

quantum physics, due to the impact on the system of the measurement action and
the resulting interpretation issues. Scholars proposed weak measurements to
amplify measured signals by exploiting a quantity called a weak value, but also
to overcome philosophical difficulties related to the system perturbation
induced by the measurement process. The method finds many applications and
raises many philosophical questions as well, especially about the proper
interpretation of the observations. In this paper, we show that any weak value
can be expressed as the expectation value of a suitable non-normal operator. We
propose a preliminary explanation of their anomalous and amplification behavior
based on the theory of non-normal matrices and their link with non-normality:
the weak value is different from an eigenvalue when the operator involved in
the expectation value is non-normal. Our study paves the way for a deeper
understanding of the measurement phenomenon, helps the design of experiments,
and it is a call for collaboration to researchers in both fields to unravel new
quantum phenomena induced by non-normality.

writing Python programs, it also brings type errors at run-time. There exist
rule-based approaches for automatically repairing Python type errors. The
approaches can generate accurate patches but they require domain experts to
design patch synthesis rules and suffer from low template coverage of
real-world type errors. Learning-based approaches alleviate the manual efforts
in designing patch synthesis rules. Among the learning-based approaches, the
prompt-based approach which leverages the knowledge base of code pre-trained
models via pre-defined prompts, obtains state-of-the-art performance in general
program repair tasks. However, such prompts are manually defined and do not
involve any specific clues for repairing Python type errors, resulting in
limited effectiveness. How to automatically improve prompts with the domain
knowledge for type error repair is challenging yet under-explored. In this
paper, we present TypeFix, a novel prompt-based approach with fix templates
incorporated for repairing Python type errors. TypeFix first mines generalized
fix templates via a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm. The identified fix
templates indicate the common edit patterns and contexts of existing type error
fixes. TypeFix then generates code prompts for code pre-trained models by
employing the generalized fix templates as domain knowledge, in which the masks
are adaptively located for each type error instead of being pre-determined.
Experiments on two benchmarks, including BugsInPy and TypeBugs, show that
TypeFix successfully repairs 26 and 55 type errors, outperforming the best
baseline approach by 9 and 14, respectively. Besides, the proposed fix template
mining approach can cover 75% of developers' patches in both benchmarks,
increasing the best rule-based approach PyTER by more than 30%.

Analysis (MOXHA) for hydrodynamic simulations of massive halos, and use it to
investigate X-ray scaling relations and hydrostatic mass bias in the Simba
cosmological hydrodynamic simulation for halos with $M_{500}\sim
10^{13-15}M_\odot$. MOXHA ties together existing yT-based software packages and
adds new functionality to provide an end-to-end pipeline for generating mock
X-ray halo data from large-scale or zoom simulation boxes. We compare
MOXHA-derived halo properties in Simba to their emission-weighted counterparts,
and forecast the systematic mass bias in mock Athena observations. Overall, we
find inferred hydrostatic masses are biased low compared to true Simba values.
For simple mass-weighting, we find $b_\text{MW} = 0.15^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$
($16-84\%$ range), while emission-weighting increases this to
$b_\text{LW}=0.30^{+0.19}_{-0.10}$. The larger bias versus mass-weighted values
we attribute to the spectroscopic and emission-weighted temperatures being
biased systematically lower than mass-weighted temperatures. The full MOXHA
pipeline recovers the emission-weighted hydrostatic masses at $R_{500}$
reasonably well, yielding $b_\text{X}=0.33^{+0.28}_{-0.34}$. MOXHA-derived halo
X-ray scalings are in very good agreement with observed scaling relations, with
the inclusion of lower-mass groups significantly steepening the
$L_\text{X}-M_{500}$, $M_{500}-T_\text{X}$, and $L_\text{X}-T_\text{X}$
relations. This indicates the strong effect the Simba feedback model has on
low-mass halos, which strongly evacuates poor groups but still retains enough
gas to reproduce observations. We find similar trends for analogous scaling
relations measured at $R_{500}$, as expected for halo-wide gas evacuation.

different copies based on the original model and distributes them to different

likely not work on other copies. A known approach achieves this using
attractor-based rewriter which injects different attractors to different
copies. This induces different adversarial regions in different copies, making
adversarial samples generated on one copy not replicable on others. In this
paper, we focus on a scenario where multiple malicious buyers collude to
attack. We first give two formulations and conduct empirical studies to analyze
effectiveness of collusion attack under different assumptions on the attacker's
capabilities and properties of the attractors. We observe that existing
attractor-based methods do not effectively mislead the colluders in the sense
that adversarial samples found are influenced more by the original model
instead of the attractors as number of colluders increases. Based on this
observation, we propose using adaptive attractors whose weight is guided by a
U-shape curve to cover the shortfalls. Experimentation results show that when
using our approach, the attack success rate of a collusion attack converges to
around 15% even when lots of copies are applied for collusion. In contrast,
when using the existing attractor-based rewriter with fixed weight, the attack
success rate increases linearly with the number of copies used for collusion.

to deal with the analysis of a large number of adaptation options is reducing

momentum $L$. The formation of the axis-symmetric clustered vortex states
(azimuthal angle independent) involves the separating of vortices with opposite
circulation and the clustering of vortices with same circulation around origin

Unlike conventional approaches that employ cascading frameworks to remove
undesirable noise first and then restore missing signal components, our model
performs these tasks in parallel using two heterogeneous decoder networks.
Based on the U-Net style encoder-decoder framework, we attach an additional
decoder so that each decoder network performs noise suppression or restoration
separately. We carefully design each decoder architecture to operate
appropriately depending on its objectives. Additionally, we improve performance
by leveraging a learnable weighting factor, aggregating the two decoder output
waveforms. Experimental results with objective metrics across various

\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ corrupted by additive Gaussian noise, is considered for
two regimes of growth of the rank $M$ as a function of $N$. For sub-linear
ranks $M=\Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha\in(0,1)$ the mutual information and
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) are derived for two classes of
signal-matrices: (a) $\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{X}\mathbf{X}^\intercal$ with entries
of $\mathbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times M}$ independent identically distributed;
(b) $\mathbf{S}$ sampled from a rotationally invariant distribution.
Surprisingly, the formulas match the rank-one case. Two efficient algorithms
are explored and conjectured to saturate the MMSE when no
statistical-to-computational gap is present: (1) Decimation Approximate Message
Passing; (2) a spectral algorithm based on a Rotation Invariant Estimator. For
linear ranks $M=\Theta(N)$ the mutual information is rigorously derived for
signal-matrices from a rotationally invariant distribution. Close connections
with scalar inference in free probability are uncovered, which allow to deduce
a simple formula for the MMSE as an integral involving the limiting spectral
measure of the data matrix only. An interesting issue is whether the known
information theoretic phase transitions for rank-one, and hence also
sub-linear-rank, still persist in linear-rank. Our analysis suggests that only
a smoothed-out trace of the transitions persists. Furthermore, the change of
behavior between low and truly high-rank regimes only happens at the linear
scale $\alpha=1$.

be comprehensively and efficiently described by the motion of a few control
points located on the movable parts of the face, i.e., landmarks. The
underlying musculoskeletal structure then allows us to learn how their motion
influences the geometrical deformations of the whole face. The proposed method
employs two distinct models to this aim: the first one learns to generate the
motion of a sparse set of landmarks from the given audio. The second model
expands such landmarks motion to a dense motion field, which is utilized to
animate a given 3D mesh in neutral state. Additionally, we introduce a novel
loss function, named Cosine Loss, which minimizes the angle between the
generated motion vectors and the ground truth ones. Using landmarks in 3D
talking head generation offers various advantages such as consistency,

simulations that reproduce the spatial resolution we will obtain with future
observations made by the 4m class telescopes DKIST and EST. We first study
multiple inversion configurations using the SIR code and the Fe I transitions
at 630 nm until we obtain minor differences between the input and the inferred
atmosphere in a wide range of heights. Also, we examine how the inversion
accuracy depends on the noise level of the Stokes profiles. The results
indicate that when the majority of the inverted pixels come from strongly
magnetised areas, there are almost no restrictions in terms of the noise,
obtaining good results for noise amplitudes up to 1$\times10^{-3}$ of $I_c$. At
the same time, the situation is different for observations where the dominant
magnetic structures are weak, and noise restraints are more demanding.
Moreover, we find that the accuracy of the fits is almost the same as that
obtained without noise when the noise levels are on the order of
1$\times10^{-4}$of $I_c$. We, therefore, advise aiming for noise values on the
order of or lower than 5$\times10^{-4}$ of $I_c$ if observers seek reliable
interpretations of the results for the magnetic field vector reliably. We
expect those noise levels to be achievable by next-generation 4m class
telescopes thanks to an optimised polarisation calibration and the large
collecting area of the primary mirror.

and thus belongs to the most fine-grained type of inference in Pearl's
causality ladder. Existing methods for counterfactual inference with continuous
outcomes aim at point identification and thus make strong and unnatural
assumptions about the underlying structural causal model. In this paper, we
relax these assumptions and aim at partial counterfactual identification of
continuous outcomes, i.e., when the counterfactual query resides in an
ignorance interval with informative bounds. We prove that, in general, the
ignorance interval of the counterfactual queries has non-informative bounds,
already when functions of structural causal models are continuously
differentiable. As a remedy, we propose a novel sensitivity model called
Curvature Sensitivity Model. This allows us to obtain informative bounds by
bounding the curvature of level sets of the functions. We further show that
existing point counterfactual identification methods are special cases of our
Curvature Sensitivity Model when the bound of the curvature is set to zero. We
then propose an implementation of our Curvature Sensitivity Model in the form
of a novel deep generative model, which we call Augmented Pseudo-Invertible
Decoder. Our implementation employs (i) residual normalizing flows with (ii)
variational augmentations. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our
Augmented Pseudo-Invertible Decoder. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the

However, limited efforts are devoted to studying empirical robustness for

the spinodal regimes. [$\ell(t)$ is the average size of the condensate at time
$t$ after the quench.] While the spatial growth is governed by the expected
conserved order parameter dynamics, the growth of magnetic order in the
spinodal regime exhibits unexpected non-conserved dynamics. The equilibrium
morphologies have density-dependent shapes which typically include the
isotropic sphere and spherical bubble morphologies in the nucleation region,
and the anisotropic cylinder, planar slab, cylindrical bubble morphologies in
the spinodal region. The structures are robust and non-volatile and exhibit
characteristic magnetic properties. For example, the oppositely magnetized
hemispheres in the spherical morphology impart the characteristics of a {\it

widely acknowledged that straightforwardly applying stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) on the overall framework when learning over a sequence of tasks results
in the phenomenon known as ``catastrophic forgetting''. Consequently, much FL
research has centered on devising federated increasing learning methods to
alleviate forgetting while augmenting knowledge. On the other hand, forgetting
is not always detrimental. The selective amnesia, also known as federated
unlearning, which entails the elimination of specific knowledge, can address
privacy concerns and create additional ``space'' for acquiring new knowledge.
However, there is a scarcity of extensive surveys that encompass recent
advancements and provide a thorough examination of this issue. In this
manuscript, we present an extensive survey on the topic of knowledge editing
(augmentation/removal) in Federated Learning, with the goal of summarizing the
state-of-the-art research and expanding the perspective for various domains.
Initially, we introduce an integrated paradigm, referred to as Federated
Editable Learning (FEL), by reevaluating the entire lifecycle of FL. Secondly,
we provide a comprehensive overview of existing methods, evaluate their
position within the proposed paradigm, and emphasize the current challenges
they face. Lastly, we explore potential avenues for future research and

high-frequency spectra from bandlimited observations. In cases where the
lowpass degradation is unknown, such as in restoring historical audio
recordings, this becomes a blind problem. This paper introduces a novel method
called BABE (Blind Audio Bandwidth Extension) that addresses the blind problem
in a zero-shot setting, leveraging the generative priors of a pre-trained
unconditional diffusion model. During the inference process, BABE utilizes a
generalized version of diffusion posterior sampling, where the degradation
operator is unknown but parametrized and inferred iteratively. The performance
of the proposed method is evaluated using objective and subjective metrics, and
the results show that BABE surpasses state-of-the-art blind bandwidth extension
baselines and achieves competitive performance compared to non-blind
filter-informed methods when tested with synthetic data. Moreover, BABE
exhibits robust generalization capabilities when enhancing real historical
recordings, effectively reconstructing the missing high-frequency content while
maintaining coherence with the original recording. Subjective preference tests
confirm that BABE significantly improves the audio quality of historical music
recordings. Examples of historical recordings restored with the proposed method

conventional deep networks with a fixed-point iteration of a single-layer

real-world scenarios, the adversarial robustness of general DEQs becomes
increasingly crucial for their reliable deployment. Existing works improve the
robustness of general DEQ models with the widely-used adversarial training (AT)
framework, but they fail to exploit the structural uniquenesses of DEQ models.
To this end, we interpret DEQs through the lens of neural dynamics and find
that AT under-regulates intermediate states. Besides, the intermediate states
typically provide predictions with a high prediction entropy. Informed by the
correlation between the entropy of dynamical systems and their stability
properties, we propose reducing prediction entropy by progressively updating
inputs along the neural dynamics. During AT, we also utilize random
intermediate states to compute the loss function. Our methods regulate the
neural dynamics of DEQ models in this manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods substantially increase the robustness of DEQ models and even

specializes in capturing an object's 3D shape while Radar provides longer

efficiently combine them for improved feature representation is still unclear.
The main challenge arises from that Radar data are extremely sparse and lack
height information. Therefore, directly integrating Radar features into
LiDAR-centric detection networks is not optimal. In this work, we introduce a
bi-directional LiDAR-Radar fusion framework, termed Bi-LRFusion, to tackle the

Bi-LRFusion involves two steps: first, it enriches Radar's local features by
learning important details from the LiDAR branch to alleviate the problems
caused by the absence of height information and extreme sparsity; second, it
combines LiDAR features with the enhanced Radar features in a unified
bird's-eye-view representation. We conduct extensive experiments on nuScenes

understanding the rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms. Several
investigations have reported in the literature corresponding flow instabilities
using established computational fluid dynamics tools. In this study, the
occurrence of flow fluctuations is investigated using either Newtonian or
non-Newtonian fluid models in patient-specific intracranial aneurysms using
high-resolution lattice Boltzmann method simulations. Flow instabilities are
quantified by computing power spectral density, proper orthogonal decomposition
and spectral entropy, and fluctuating kinetic energy of velocity fluctuations.
Furthermore, these hemodynamic parameters are compared between the ruptured and
unruptured aneurysms. Our simulations reveal that the pulsatile inflow through
the neck in a ruptured aneurysm is subject to a hydrodynamic instability
leading to high-frequency fluctuations around the rupture position throughout
the entire cardiac cycle. At other locations, the flow instability is only
observed during the deceleration phase; typically, the fluctuations begin there
just after peak systole, gradually decay, and the flow returns to its original,
laminar pulsatile state during diastole. In the unruptured aneurysm, there is
only minimal difference between Newtonian and non-Newtonian results. In the
ruptured case, using the non-Newtonian model leads to a considerable increase
of the fluctuations within the aneurysm sac.

X-ray flares, with average luminosities exceeding 10$^{36}$~erg~s$^{-1}$. Our

previous flares ($\phi=0.35$) in this source detected by other telescopes. We
conclude that this flare occurs as a result of the periastron passage of the
neutron star, rather than due to the presence of a corotating interaction
region (CIR). Furthermore, from the energy-resolved pulse profile analysis of
IGR J16320-4751, we find that the pulse fraction is lower in hard X-rays

a cyclotron absorption feature in either target. We provide estimates of the
surface magnetic field strength of NS in IGR J16320-4751 using two indirect

that transforms visual sensor data into polygonal shapes with Diffusion Models
(DM), an emerging machinery amid exploding generative AI, while formulating
reconstruction as a generation process conditioned on sensor data. The task of
structured reconstruction poses two fundamental challenges to DM: 1) A
structured geometry is a ``set'' (e.g., a set of polygons for a floorplan
geometry), where a sample of $N$ elements has $N!$ different but equivalent
representations, making the denoising highly ambiguous; and 2) A
``reconstruction'' task has a single solution, where an initial noise needs to
be chosen carefully, while any initial noise works for a generation task. Our
technical contribution is the introduction of a Guided Set Diffusion Model
where 1) the forward diffusion process learns guidance networks to control
noise injection so that one representation of a sample remains distinct from
its other permutation variants, thus resolving denoising ambiguity; and 2) the
reverse denoising process reconstructs polygonal shapes, initialized and
directed by the guidance networks, as a conditional generation process subject
to the sensor data. We have evaluated our approach for reconstructing two types
of polygonal shapes: floorplan as a set of polygons and HD map for autonomous
cars as a set of polylines. Through extensive experiments on standard

clarify that the mixing layer of the Mixer has an effective expression as a
wider MLP whose weights are sparse and represented by the Kronecker product.
This expression naturally defines a permuted-Kronecker (PK) family, which can
be regarded as a general class of mixing layers and is also regarded as an
approximation of Monarch matrices. Subsequently, because the PK family
effectively constitutes a wide MLP with sparse weights, one can apply the
hypothesis proposed by Golubeva, Neyshabur and Gur-Ari (2021) that the

between different molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small
molecule, etc. Designing a generalist model to learn universal molecular
interactions is valuable yet challenging, given that different molecules are
usually represented in different granularity. In this paper, we first propose
to universally represent a 3D molecule as a geometric graph of sets, in
contrast to conventional single-level representations. Upon the proposed
unified representation, we then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer
(GET) to effectively capture both sparse block-level and dense atom-level
interactions. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a
feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where, notably, each
module is E(3) equivariant to meet the symmetry of 3D world. Extensive
experiments on the prediction of protein-protein affinity, ligand binding
affinity, and ligand efficacy prediction verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method against existing methods, and reveal its potential to learn
transferable knowledge across different domains and different tasks.

aspect information, or using data mining or machine learning approaches to
extract aspects from implicit user feedback such as user reviews. It however
remains under-explored how the extracted aspects can help generate more
meaningful recommendations to the users. Meanwhile, existing research on
aspect-based recommendations often relies on separate aspect extraction models
or assumes the aspects are given, without accounting for the fact the optimal
set of aspects could be dependent on the recommendation task at hand.
  In this work, we propose to combine aspect extraction together with
aspect-based recommendations in an end-to-end manner, achieving the two goals
together in a single framework. For the aspect extraction component, we
leverage the recent advances in large language models and design a new prompt
learning mechanism to generate aspects for the end recommendation task. For the
aspect-based recommendation component, the extracted aspects are concatenated
with the usual user and item features used by the recommendation model. The
recommendation task mediates the learning of the user embeddings and item
embeddings, which are used as soft prompts to generate aspects. Therefore, the
extracted aspects are personalized and contextualized by the recommendation
task. We showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive
experiments on three industrial datasets, where our proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both the personalized
aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation tasks. In particular, we
demonstrate that it is necessary and beneficial to combine the learning of
aspect extraction and aspect-based recommendation together. We also conduct
extensive ablation studies to understand the contribution of each design

to new interests, has been shown to improve users' long-term experience on
recommendation platforms \cite{chen2021values}. Users however are not
constantly looking to explore novel content. It is therefore crucial to
understand their novelty-seeking intent and adjust the recommendation policy
accordingly. Most existing literature models a user's propensity to choose
novel content or to prefer a more diverse set of recommendations at individual
interactions. Hierarchical structure, on the other hand, exists in a user's
novelty-seeking intent, which is manifested as a static and intrinsic user
preference for seeking novelty along with a dynamic session-based propensity.
To this end, we propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning-based
method to model the hierarchical user novelty-seeking intent, and to adapt the
recommendation policy accordingly based on the extracted user novelty-seeking
propensity. We further incorporate diversity and novelty-related measurement in
the reward function of the hierarchical RL (HRL) agent to encourage user
exploration \cite{chen2021values}. We demonstrate the benefits of explicitly
modeling hierarchical user novelty-seeking intent in recommendations through
extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets. In particular, we
demonstrate that the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical RL-based method

which the degrees of freedom are coupled through synaptic connections and
evolve according to a set of differential equations. When the synaptic
connections are sufficiently strong and random, such models display a chaotic
phase which can be used to perform a task if the network is carefully trained.
It is fair to say that this setting applies to many other complex systems, from
biological organisms (from cells, to individuals and populations) to financial
markets. For all these out-of-equilibrium systems, elementary units live in a
chaotic environment and need to adapt their strategies to survive by extracting
information from the environment and controlling the feedback loop on it. In
this work we consider a prototypical high-dimensional chaotic system as a
simplified model for a recurrent neural network and more complex learning
systems. We study the model under two particular training strategies: Hebbian
training and FORCE training. In the first case we show that Hebbian training
can be used to tune the level of chaos in the dynamics and this reproduces some
results recently obtained in the study of standard models of RNN. In the latter
case, we show that the dynamical system can be trained to reproduce a simple
periodic function. We show that the FORCE algorithm drives the dynamics close
to an asymptotic attractor the larger the training time. We also discuss
possible extensions of our setup to other learning strategies.

both interlayer and intralayer coupling in 2DLM 2H$_c$-MoS$_2$. The analysis of
the low-temperature (10-300 K) Mo K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine

means-squared relative displacements $\sigma^2$ for nearest and distant Mo-S

characteristic Einstein frequencies $\omega_E$ and the effective force

The studied temperature range was extended up to 1200 K employing AIMD
simulations which were validated at 300 K using the EXAFS data. Both RMC and

design pruning techniques that reduce the resource demand of deep learning

factorizations to represent the network weights. Although able to retain
accuracy, we observe that low-rank methods tend to compromise model robustness
against adversarial perturbations. By modeling robustness in terms of the
condition number of the neural network, we argue that this loss of robustness
is due to the exploding singular values of the low-rank weight matrices. Thus,
we introduce a robust low-rank training algorithm that maintains the network's
weights on the low-rank matrix manifold while simultaneously enforcing
approximate orthonormal constraints. The resulting model reduces both training

adversarial robustness, without compromising model accuracy. This is shown by

the eight-level manifold of the $^2F_{7/2}$ state, which is highly sensitive to
a possible violation of LLI, and show that the UR10 sequence can be used for
high-fidelity Ramsey spectroscopy in noisy environments. The UR10 sequence is
implemented experimentally in the $^2F_{7/2}$ manifold and a coherent signal of

perform the most stringent test of LLI in the electron-photon sector to date.
Due to the robustness of the UR10 sequence, it can be applied on larger ion

depending on the observer's ability to interact with the system. Graded monads
have been shown to provide a unifying framework for spectra of behavioural
equivalences. Here, we transfer this principle to spectra of behavioural
metrics, working at a coalgebraic level of generality, that is, parametrically
in the system type. In the ensuing development of quantitative graded
semantics, we discuss presentations of graded monads on the category of metric
spaces in terms of graded quantitative equational theories. Moreover, we obtain
a canonical generic notion of invariant real-valued modal logic, and provide

inference, which finds important applications in various scientific domains.
The most wide-spread message passing scheme is the sum-product algorithm (SPA)

cycles. We search for an alternative message passing algorithm that works
particularly well on such cyclic graphs. Therefore, we challenge the extrinsic
principle of the SPA, which loses its objective on graphs with cycles. We
further replace the local SPA message update rule at the factor nodes of the
underlying graph with a generic mapping, which is optimized in a data-driven
fashion. These modifications lead to a considerable improvement in performance
while preserving the simplicity of the SPA. We evaluate our method for two
classes of cyclic graphs: the 2x2 fully connected Ising grid and factor graphs
for symbol detection on linear communication channels with inter-symbol
interference. To enable the method for large graphs as they occur in practical
applications, we develop a novel loss function that is inspired by the Bethe

the field of super-resolution with the addition of high-resolution reference
images to reconstruct low-resolution (LR) inputs with more high-frequency
details, thereby overcoming some limitations of single image super-resolution
(SISR). Previous research in the field of RefSR has mostly focused on two
crucial aspects. The first is accurate correspondence matching between the LR
and the reference (Ref) image. The second is the effective transfer and
aggregation of similar texture information from the Ref images. Nonetheless, an
important detail of perceptual loss and adversarial loss has been
underestimated, which has a certain adverse effect on texture transfer and
reconstruction. In this study, we propose a feature reuse framework that guides
the step-by-step texture reconstruction process through different stages,
reducing the negative impacts of perceptual and adversarial loss. The feature
reuse framework can be used for any RefSR model, and several RefSR approaches
have improved their performance after being retrained using our framework.
Additionally, we introduce a single image feature embedding module and a
texture-adaptive aggregation module. The single image feature embedding module
assists in reconstructing the features of the LR inputs itself and effectively
lowers the possibility of including irrelevant textures. The texture-adaptive
aggregation module dynamically perceives and aggregates texture information
between the LR inputs and the Ref images using dynamic filters. This enhances
the utilization of the reference texture while reducing reference misuse. The

underlying causes for failures and enabling prompt mitigation actions. However,
maintainers need to inspect a large volume of daily logs to identify the
anomalous logs that reveal failure details for further diagnosis. Thus, how to
automatically distinguish these anomalous logs from normal logs becomes a
critical problem. Existing approaches alleviate the burden on software
maintainers, but they are built upon an improper yet critical assumption:
logging statements in the software remain unchanged. While software keeps
evolving, our empirical study finds that evolving software brings three
challenges: log parsing errors, evolving log events, and unstable log
sequences.
  In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach named Evolving Log
analyzer (EvLog) to mitigate these challenges. We first build a multi-level
representation extractor to process logs without parsing to prevent errors from
the parser. The multi-level representations preserve the essential semantics of
logs while leaving out insignificant changes in evolving events. EvLog then
implements an anomaly discriminator with an attention mechanism to identify the
anomalous logs and avoid the issue brought by the unstable sequence. EvLog has
shown effectiveness in two real-world system evolution log datasets with an
average F1 score of 0.955 and 0.847 in the intra-version setting and
inter-version setting, respectively, which outperforms other state-of-the-art
approaches by a wide margin. To our best knowledge, this is the first study on
tackling anomalous logs over software evolution. We believe our work sheds new
light on the impact of software evolution with the corresponding solutions for

theoretical behaviour of these functions is not fully understood. Creating deep
neural networks by stacking many layers has achieved exceptional performance in
many applications and contributed to the recent explosion of these methods.
Previous works have shown that depth can exponentially increase the
expressibility of the network. However, as networks get deeper and deeper, they
are more susceptible to becoming degenerate. We observe this degeneracy in the
sense that on initialization, inputs tend to become more and more correlated as
they travel through the layers of the network. If a network has too many
layers, it tends to approximate a (random) constant function, making it
effectively incapable of distinguishing between inputs. This seems to affect
the training of the network and cause it to perform poorly, as we empirically
investigate in this paper. We use a simple algorithm that can accurately
predict the level of degeneracy for any given fully connected ReLU network
architecture, and demonstrate how the predicted degeneracy relates to training
dynamics of the network. We also compare this prediction to predictions derived

numerical simulations have been used to understand such complex systems, but
the physical interpretation of different active nematic models and their
applicability to specific systems is often unclear. For instance, most works
rely on theories for incompressible liquid crystals but important active 2D
nematic systems are compressible due to density variations or turnover. Here,
we propose a theoretical and computational framework for possibly compressible
and density-dependent 2D active nematic systems. This framework is based on
Onsager's variational formalism to irreversible thermodynamics, according to
which the dynamics result from a competition between free-energy release,
dissipation and activity. We particularize this framework to recover a standard
incompressible active nematic model and further formulate an alternative model
for density-dependent active nemato-hydrodynamics. We show that the variational
principle enables a direct and transparent derivation not only of the governing
equations, but also of the finite element numerical scheme. We exercise this
model in two representative examples of active nematodynamics relevant to the
actin cytoskeleton during wound healing and to the dynamics of confined

the quadratic estimator (EQ) method, which is widely used to reconstruct
lensing potential, has been known to be sub-optimal for the low-noise levels

train and test network models, we find that for noise levels less than
$5\mu$K-arcmin, RDLFUnet can recover the input gravitational potential with a
higher signal-to-noise ratio than the previous deep learning and the
traditional QE methods at almost the entire observation scales.

agents which communicate by broadcasting and receiving messages. In our model,
the broadcast topology is reconfigurable so that a sent message can be received
by any set of agents. In addition, agents have local registers which are
initially distinct and may therefore be thought of as identifiers. When an
agent broadcasts a message, it appends to the message the value stored in one
of its registers. Upon reception, an agent can store the received value or test
this value for equality with one of its own registers. We consider the
coverability problem, where one asks whether a given state of the system may be
reached by at least one agent. We establish that this problem is decidable;
however, it is as hard as coverability in lossy channel systems, which is
non-primitive recursive. This model lies at the frontier of decidability as
other classical problems on this model are undecidable; this is in particular
true for the target problem where all processes must synchronize on a given
state. By contrast, we show that the coverability problem is NP-complete when
each agent has only one register.

production mechanism without relying on any non-gravitational interactions
between the dark sector and the Standard Model. In theories of ``Large'' Extra
Dimensions (LEDs), the true scale of quantum gravity, $M_*$, could be well
below the Planck scale, thus allowing for energetic particle collisions to
produce microscopic black holes in the primordial plasma at temperatures as low
as $T \gtrsim 100$ GeV. Additionally, LEDs modify the relationship between
black hole mass, radius, and temperature, allowing microscopic black holes to
grow to macroscopic sizes in the early Universe. In this work we study three
scenarios for the production of dark matter via LED black holes: 1) Delayed
Evaporating Black Holes (DEBHs) which grow to macroscopic sizes before
ultimately evaporating, 2) Instantly Evaporating Black Holes (IEBHs) which
immediately evaporate, and 3) stable black hole relics with a mass $M_*$ known
as Planckeons. For a given reheating temperature, $T_\mathrm{RH}$, we show that
DEBHs produce significantly less dark matter than both IEBHs and Planckeons.
IEBHs are able to produce the observed relic abundance of dark matter so long
as the reheating scale is in the range $10^{-2} \leq T_\mathrm{RH}/M_* \leq
10^{-1}$. We calculate the average speed for the resulting dark matter and show
that it would be sufficiently cold for all dark matter masses $m_{dm} \gtrsim
10^{-4}$ GeV. This mechanism is viable for any scale of quantum gravity in the

methods based on pruning and quantization have emerged. They are remarkable in
reducing the size, parameter number, and computational complexity of the model.
However, most of the models compressed by such methods need the support of
special hardware and software, which increases the deployment cost. Moreover,
these methods are mainly used in classification tasks, and rarely directly used
in detection tasks. To address these issues, for the object detection network
we introduce a three-stage model compression method: dynamic sparse training,
group channel pruning, and spatial attention distilling. Firstly, to select out
the unimportant channels in the network and maintain a good balance between
sparsity and accuracy, we put forward a dynamic sparse training method, which
introduces a variable sparse rate, and the sparse rate will change with the
training process of the network. Secondly, to reduce the effect of pruning on
network accuracy, we propose a novel pruning method called group channel
pruning. In particular, we divide the network into multiple groups according to
the scales of the feature layer and the similarity of module structure in the
network, and then we use different pruning thresholds to prune the channels in
each group. Finally, to recover the accuracy of the pruned network, we use an
improved knowledge distillation method for the pruned network. Especially, we
extract spatial attention information from the feature maps of specific scales
in each group as knowledge for distillation. In the experiments, we use YOLOv4
as the object detection network and PASCAL VOC as the training dataset. Our
method reduces the parameters of the model by 64.7 % and the calculation by
34.9%.

localisation-delocalisation transition.
  We also prove delocalisation in the six-vertex model with $0< a, b \leq c
\leq a + b$. This yields a new proof of continuity of the phase transition in
the random-cluster and Potts models in two dimensions, for $1 \leq q \leq 4$.
We rely neither on integrability tools (parafermionic observables, Bethe

  Our approach goes through novel graphical representations that satisfy planar
duality, the joint FKG and the domain Markov properties. This enables us to use
the non-coexistence theorem of Zhang and Sheffield and prove delocalisation all

the $\mathbb T$-circuit argument.
  Finally, in the regimes $\frac12 \leq x^2 \leq 1$ and $a = b \leq c \leq a +

  To better understand the value of optimizing for AUC, we present an efficient
algorithm, namely AUC-opt, to find the provably optimal AUC linear classifier
in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which runs in $\mathcal{O}(n_+ n_- \log (n_+ n_-))$ where
$n_+$ and $n_-$ are the number of positive and negative samples respectively.
Furthermore, it can be naturally extended to $\mathbb{R}^d$ in
$\mathcal{O}((n_+n_-)^{d-1}\log (n_+n_-))$ by calling AUC-opt in
lower-dimensional spaces recursively. We prove the problem is NP-complete when
$d$ is not fixed, reducing from the \textit{open hemisphere problem}.
  Experiments show that compared with other methods, AUC-opt achieves
statistically significant improvements on between 17 to 40 in $\mathbb{R}^2$

key challenge. Although existing neural radiance field methods can produce
photorealistic views under narrow-baseline and dense image captures, they tend
to overfit the training views when dealing with \emph{wide-baseline} panoramas
due to the difficulty in learning accurate geometry from sparse $360^{\circ}$
views. To address this problem, we propose PanoGRF, Generalizable Spherical
Radiance Fields for Wide-baseline Panoramas, which construct spherical radiance
fields incorporating $360^{\circ}$ scene priors. Unlike generalizable radiance
fields trained on perspective images, PanoGRF avoids the information loss from
panorama-to-perspective conversion and directly aggregates geometry and
appearance features of 3D sample points from each panoramic view based on
spherical projection. Moreover, as some regions of the panorama are only
visible from one view while invisible from others under wide baseline settings,
PanoGRF incorporates $360^{\circ}$ monocular depth priors into spherical depth
estimation to improve the geometry features. Experimental results on multiple
panoramic datasets demonstrate that PanoGRF significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art generalizable view synthesis methods for wide-baseline

Another essential issue that arises when purchasing or selling a good or

to take transaction costs into account. The main purpose of this paper is to
apply the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method at a uniform grid for
solving the HCIR model with transaction costs in the European style and
comparing it with the explicit finite difference (EFD) scheme. Also, as
evidence for numerical convergence, we convert the HCIR model with transaction
costs to a linear PDE (HCIR) by ignoring transaction costs, then we estimate
the solution of HCIR PDE using the ADI method which is a class of finite
difference schemes, and compare it with analytical solution and EFD scheme. For
multi-dimensional Black-Scholes equations, the ADI method, which is a category
of finite difference techniques, is appropriate. When the dimensionality of the
space increases, finite difference techniques frequently become more complex to
perform, comprehend, and apply. Consequently, we employ the ADI approach to
divide a multi-dimensional problem into several simpler, quite manageable

an audio signal by removing unwanted noise. It is used as preprocessing in
numerous applications such as speech recognition, hearing aids, broadcasting

reference-based objective metrics that are shown to correlate poorly with human
perception. In order to evaluate audio quality as perceived by human observers
it is thus fundamental to resort to subjective quality assessment. In this
paper, a user evaluation based on crowdsourcing (subjective) and the Comparison
Category Rating (CCR) method is compared against the DNSMOS, ViSQOL and 3QUEST
(objective) metrics. The overall quality scores of three speech enhancement
algorithms from real time communications (RTC) are used in the comparison using
the P.808 toolkit. Results indicate that while the CCR scale allows
participants to identify differences between processed and unprocessed audio
samples, two groups of preferences emerge: some users rate positively by
focusing on noise suppression processing, while others rate negatively by
focusing mainly on speech quality. We further present results on the
parameters, size considerations and speaker variations that are critical and
should be considered when designing the CCR-based crowdsourcing evaluation.

ferromagnetic phase and two distinct valence-bond-solid (VBS) phases. The first
VBS phase, referred to as $\mathcal{D}_3$-VBS, is typified by the formation of
valence bonds between third-neighbor spin-1/2's, persisting as a continuation

both VBS states are identified as being of Haldane-type, marked by a finite SOP

qualifications, accepting the most qualified until reaching capacities. The
selection into groups leads to a bias in standard estimates of peer effects,
which is difficult to correct for due to equilibrium effects. We employ the
limiting approximation of a market as the market size grows large to simplify
the selection bias. Assuming exchangeable unobservables, we can express the
selection bias of an individual as a group-invariant nonparametric function of

blocks, which include the mechanical analogs of mass, elasticity, damping, and
coupling of each resonator element. While these mechanical parameters are
typically obtained from response spectra using least-squares fitting, this
approach requires a priori knowledge of all parameters and is susceptible to
large error due to convergence to local minima. Here we validate an alternative
algebraic means to characterize resonator networks with no or minimal a priori

linear homogeneous algebraic equation and solves the equation with a set of
discrete measured network response vectors. For validation, we employ our

propensity scores and unmeasured confounding is addressed through (Bayesian)
dynamic borrowing. Most efforts to date have focused on augmenting control arms
with historical controls. Here we consider augmenting treatment arms through
""expanded access"", which is a pathway of non-trial access to investigational
medicine for patients with seriously debilitating or life-threatening
illnesses. Motivated by a case study on expanded access, we developed a novel
method (the ProPP) that provides a conceptually simple and easy-to-use
combination of propensity score weighting and the modified power prior. Our
weighting scheme is based on the estimation of the average treatment effect of
the patients in the trial, with the constraint that external patients cannot
receive higher weights than trial patients. The causal implications of the
weighting scheme and propensity-score integrated approaches in general are
discussed. In a simulation study our method compares favorably with existing
(hybrid) borrowing methods in terms of precision and type-I error rate. We
illustrate our method by jointly analysing individual patient data from the
trial and expanded access program for vemurafenib to treat metastatic melanoma.
Our method provides a double safeguard against prior-data conflict and forms a
straightforward addition to evidence synthesis methods of trial and real-world
(expanded access) data.

arrangement of the magnetic superlattices, it is a great challenge to perform a
direct DFT calculation on them. In this work, an equivariant deep learning
framework is designed to accelerate the electronic calculation of magnetic
systems by exploiting both the equivariant constraints of the magnetic

framework can bypass the costly self-consistent iterations and build a direct
mapping from a magnetic configuration to the ab initio Hamiltonian matrix.
After training on the magnets with random magnetic configurations, our model
achieved high accuracy on the test structures outside the training set, such as
spin spiral and non-collinear antiferromagnetic configurations. The trained

when $m=2$, a solution corresponds to a conformal isometric immersion of the
universal covering $\widetilde M$ into $\mathbb{R}^3$ with prescribed mean
curvature $f$; meanwhile, for general dimensions and $f\equiv constant\neq0$, a
solution provides an upper bound estimate for the B\""ar-Hijazi-Lott invariant.

specific models on the manifold $(S^m,\textit{g})$ where the solution set of
the spinorial Yamabe-type problem is not compact: $1).$ the geometric potential
$f$ is constant (say $f\equiv1$) with the background metric $\textit{g}$ being
a $C^k$ perturbation of the canonical round metric $\textit{g}_{S^m}$, which is
not conformally flat somewhere on $S^m$; $2).$ $f$ is a perturbation from
constant and is of class $C^2$, while the background metric
$\textit{g}\equiv\textit{g}_{S^m}$.

demonstrate that the proposed ADC-cycleGAN model produces comparable samples to

structures, as well as the telescope beams, have Gaussian shapes. This study
employed model images of the spherical and cylindrical objects with Gaussian
and power-law shapes, representing the dense cores and filaments. The images
are convolved to a wide range of angular resolutions to probe various degrees
of resolvedness of the models. Simplified flat, convex, and concave backgrounds
were added to the images, then planar backgrounds across the footprints of the
structures are subtracted and sizes were measured and deconvolved. When
background subtraction is inaccurate, the structures acquire profoundly
non-Gaussian profiles. The deconvolved half maximum sizes can be strongly
under- or overestimated, by factors of up to ~20 when the structures are
unresolved or partially resolved. For resolved structures, the errors are
within a factor of ~2; although some power-law models show the factors of up to
~6. The size deconvolution method cannot be applied to unresolved structures,
it can only be used for the Gaussian-like structures, including the critical
Bonnor-Ebert spheres, when they are at least partially resolved. The method
must be considered inapplicable for the power-law structures with shallow
profiles. This work also reveals subtle properties of convolution for different
geometries. When convolved with different kernels, spherical objects and
cylindrical filaments with identical profiles obtain different widths and
shapes. A filament, imaged by the telescope with a non-Gaussian PSF, could
appear substantially shallower than the structure is in reality, even when it

of fatigue detection from biomechanical data from different sources, consisting
of lower extremity joint angles and ground reaction forces from running
athletes with the goal of better understanding the impact of fatigue on the
biomechanics of runners in general and on an individual level. This is done by
sequentially testing for change in a datastream using a simple martingale test
statistic. Time-uniform probabilistic martingale bounds are provided which are
used as thresholds for the test statistic. Sharp bounds can be developed by a
hybrid of a piece-wise linear- and a law of iterated logarithm- bound over all
time regimes, where the probability of an early detection is controlled in a
uniform way. If the underlying distribution of the data gradually changes over
the course of a run, then a timely upcrossing of the martingale over these
bounds is expected. The methods are developed for a setting when change sets in
gradually in an incoming stream of data. Parameter selection for the bounds are
based on simulations and methodological comparison is done with respect to
existing advances. The algorithms presented here can be easily adapted to an
online change-detection setting. Finally, we provide a detailed data analysis
based on extensive measurements of several athletes and benchmark the fatigue
detection results with the runners' individual feedback over the course of the

survey to target $z>5.2$. Measuring the [CII] power spectrum allows us to study
the role of dusty star-forming galaxies in the star formation history during
the Reionization and post-Reionization. The main obstacle to this measurement
is the contamination by bright foregrounds. We evaluate our ability to retrieve
the [CII] signal in mock observations using the Simulated Infrared Dusty
Extragalactic Sky. We compared two methods for dealing with the dust continuum
emission from galaxies: the standard PCA and the arPLS method. For line
interlopers, the strategy relies on masking low-redshift galaxies using
external catalogues. As we do not have observations of CO or classical CO
proxies ,we relied on the COSMOS stellar mass catalogue. To measure the power
spectrum of masked data, we adapted the P of K EstimatoR and discuss its use on
LIM data. The arPLS method achieves a reduction of the continuum background to
a sub-dominant level of the [CII] at z=7 by a factor of>70. When using PCA,
this factor is only 0.7. The masking lowers the power amplitude of line
contamination down to $2 \times 10^2 Jy^2/sr$ This residual level is dominated
by faint undetected sources. For our [CII] model, this results in a detection
at z = 5.2 with a power ratio [CII]/(residual interlopers) = $62 \pm 32$ for a
22 % area survey loss. However, at z = 7, [C II ] / (residual interlopers)$=2.0
\pm 1.4$. Thanks to the large area covered by SIDES-Uchuu, we show that the
power amplitude of line residuals varies by 12-15% for z=5.2-7. We present an
end-to-end simulation of the extragalactic foreground removal that we ran to
detect the [CII] at high redshift via its power spectrum. We show that dust
continuum emission are not a limiting foreground for [CII] LIM. Residual CO and
[CI] limits our ability to measure the [CII] power spectrum at z>7.

development and optimization of modern plasma devices. With the trend of
decreasing pressure in applications such as plasma etching, kinetic simulations
are necessary to self-consistently capture the particle dynamics. The standard,
explicit, electrostatic, momentum-conserving Particle-In-Cell method suffers
from tight stability constraints to resolve the electron plasma length (i.e.
Debye length) and time scales (i.e. plasma period). This results in very high
computational cost, making this technique generally prohibitive for the large
volume entire device modeling (EDM). We explore the Direct Implicit algorithm
and the explicit Energy Conserving algorithm as alternatives to the standard
approach, which can reduce computational cost with minimal (or controllable)
impact on results. These algorithms are implemented into the well-tested
EDIPIC-2D and LTP-PIC codes, and their performance is evaluated by testing on a
2D capacitively coupled plasma discharge scenario. The investigation revels
that both approaches enable the utilization of cell sizes larger than the Debye
length, resulting in reduced runtime, while incurring only a minor compromise
in accuracy. The methods also allow for time steps larger than the electron
plasma period, however this can lead to numerical heating or cooling. The study
further demonstrates that by appropriately adjusting the ratio of cell size to
time step, it is possible to mitigate this effect to acceptable level.

probability (QMBDP). Imagine a quantum many-body system starting from a

positions of the system. The detectors make simultaneous stroboscopic
projective measurements of some chosen local operators. A particular
measurement outcome is taken as the `signal'. By QMBDP we refer to the
probability that the signal is detected within a given time. We find that, due
to repeated stroboscopic measurements, there can emerge a time-scale within
which the signal is almost certainly detected. Depending on the spectral
properties of the Hamiltonian, there can be a phase transition where this
time-scale increases dramatically on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters across
the transition point. Consequently, over a finite but large regime of time,
depending on the initial state, tuning some Hamiltonian parameters can result
in sharp transition from a phase where the signal is certainly detected (QMBDP
$=1$) to a phase where the the signal may not be detected (QMBDP $<1$). As an
example, we present a single-impurity non-integrable model where such a

fairness, which aims to select k influential nodes to maximise the spread of
information in a network, while ensuring that selected sensitive user
attributes are fairly affected, i.e., are proportionally similar between the
original network and the affected users. Recent studies on this problem focused
only on extremely small networks, hence the challenge remains on how to achieve
a scalable solution, applicable to networks with millions or billions of nodes.
We propose an approach that is based on learning node representations for fair
spread from diffusion cascades, instead of the social connectivity s.t. we can
deal with very large graphs. We propose two data-driven approaches: (a)
fairness-based participant sampling (FPS), and (b) fairness as context (FAC).
Spread related user features, such as the probability of diffusing information
to others, are derived from the historical information cascades, using a deep
neural network. The extracted features are then used in selecting influencers
that maximize the influence spread, while being also fair with respect to the
chosen sensitive attributes. In FPS, fairness and cascade length information
are considered independently in the decision-making process, while FAC
considers these information facets jointly and considers correlations between
them. The proposed algorithms are generic and represent the first policy-driven
solutions that can be applied to arbitrary sets of sensitive attributes at
scale. We evaluate the performance of our solutions on a real-world public
dataset (Sina Weibo) and on a hybrid real-synthethic dataset (Digg), which
exhibit all the facets that we exploit, namely diffusion network, diffusion
traces, and user profiles. These experiments show that our methods outperform
the state-the-art solutions in terms of spread, fairness, and scalability.

in real-world driving scenes. Source-free domain adaptation, as a more
practical technique, addresses the concerns of data privacy and storage
limitations in typical unsupervised domain adaptation methods. It utilizes a
well-trained source model and unlabeled target data to achieve adaptation in
the target domain. However, in the absence of source data and target labels,
current solutions cannot sufficiently reduce the impact of domain shift and
fully leverage the information from the target data. In this paper, we propose
an end-to-end source-free domain adaptation semantic segmentation method via
Importance-Aware and Prototype-Contrast (IAPC) learning. The proposed IAPC
framework effectively extracts domain-invariant knowledge from the well-trained
source model and learns domain-specific knowledge from the unlabeled target
domain. Specifically, considering the problem of domain shift in the prediction
of the target domain by the source model, we put forward an importance-aware
mechanism for the biased target prediction probability distribution to extract
domain-invariant knowledge from the source model. We further introduce a
prototype-contrast strategy, which includes a prototype-symmetric cross-entropy
loss and a prototype-enhanced cross-entropy loss, to learn target intra-domain
knowledge without relying on labels. A comprehensive variety of experiments on
two domain adaptive semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrates that the
proposed end-to-end IAPC solution outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods. Code will be made publicly available at

unified manner. In particular, we leverage the capacities of PLMs on both
textual and numerical inputs, and apply a multi-field input that modularizes
each dimension of user satisfaction as an input field. Overall, SAT-Ranker is
an effective, extensible, and data-centric framework that has huge potential

SAT-Ranker obtains remarkable gains on various evaluation sets targeting
different dimensions of user satisfaction. It is now fully deployed online to

closest to the uniform copula when measured in Kullback-Leibler divergence. For

MICK, a novel minimum information copula where Kendall's rank correlation is

observe local and global dependencies of MICK, thereby unifying results on

morphological K-correction for M81 and makes it possible to reproduce images
for the bulge and the disk in the galaxy at any waveband. The morphology as a
function of wavelength appears as a variable-slope trend of the Sersic index

shallow at optical--NIR bands; the position angle and the axis ratio keep
invariable at least at optical--NIR bands. It is worth noting that, the Sersic

to about 1 at UV bands. This difference brings forward a caveat that, a
classical bulge is likely misidentified for a pseudo-bulge or no bulge at high

that starting with a genuine state of nonmolecular nature, but which couples to
some meson-meson component to be observable in that channel, if that state is
blamed for a bound state appearing below the meson-meson threshold it gets
dressed with a meson cloud and it becomes pure molecular in the limit case of
zero binding. We discuss the issue of the scales, and see that if the genuine
state has a mass very close to threshold, the theorem holds, but the molecular
probability goes to unity in a very narrow range of energies close to
threshold. The conclusion is that the value of the binding does not determine
the compositeness of a state. However, in such extreme cases we see that the
scattering length gets progressively smaller and the effective range grows
indefinitely. In other words, the binding energy does not determine the
compositeness of a state, but the additional information of the scattering
length and effective range can provide an answer. We also show that the
consideration of a direct attractive interaction between the mesons in addition
to having a genuine component, increases the compositeness of the state.
Explicit calculations are done for the $T_{cc}(3875)$ state, but are easily
generalized to any hadronic system.

contained in validation reports. Using a unique dataset of 657 findings raised
by validation teams in a large international banking group between January 2019
and December 2022. The findings are classified into nine validation dimensions
and assigned a severity level by validators using their expert knowledge. The
authors use embedding generation for the findings' titles and observations
using four different pre-trained models, including ""module\_url"" from
TensorFlow Hub and three models from the SentenceTransformer library, namely
""all-mpnet-base-v2"", ""all-MiniLM-L6-v2"", and ""paraphrase-mpnet-base-v2"". The

similar characteristics, enabling the identification of common problems within
each validation dimension and severity. The results of the study show that
clustering is an effective approach for identifying and classifying credit risk
model problems with accuracy higher than 60\%. The authors also employ machine
learning algorithms, including logistic regression and XGBoost, to predict the
validation dimension and its severity, achieving an accuracy of 80\% for
XGBoost algorithm. Furthermore, the study identifies the top 10 words that
predict a validation dimension and severity. Overall, this paper makes a

for analyzing textual information in validation reports, and providing insights
into the types of problems encountered in the development and validation of
credit risk models.

software engineers to develop cloud applications as a set of functions (called
serverless functions). However, accurately obtaining the performance (i.e.,
response latency) of serverless functions is challenging due to the highly
dynamic nature of the environment in which they run. To tackle this problem, a
possible solution is to use performance testing to determine how many
repetitions of a serverless function with a given input are needed to cater to
the performance fluctuation. To this end, we conduct an empirical study of
state-of-the-art performance testing techniques for traditional cloud
applications on 65 serverless functions collected from top-tier research
venues. We find that these techniques exhibit low accuracy. Therefore, we
propose SuperFlow, the first performance testing approach tailored specifically

However, these experiments rely on high-energy laser systems not suitable for

that large-scale electrically-connected plasmonic nanoantenna networks, when
driven in concert, enable a much higher charge yield sufficient for
shot-to-shot carrier-envelope phase detection, which is a hallmark of the
underlying sub-cycle processes. We use a tailored sub-2-cycle mid-infrared

carrier-envelope-phase-sensitive electrons from interconnected plasmonic
nanoantenna arrays that we detect on a single-shot basis using conventional

By engineering the nanoantennas to the particular use case, such as
carrier-envelope phase detection, and optimizing the density and total amount,
the output signals are fully controlled. This approach to optical frequency

and predict families' preferences. The most widely-used choice model, the
multinomial logit (MNL), is linear in school and/or household attributes. While
the model is simple and interpretable, it assumes the ranked preference lists
arise from a choice process that is uniform throughout the ranking, from top to
bottom. In this work, we introduce two strategies for rank-heterogeneous choice
modeling tailored for school choice. First, we adapt a context-dependent random
utility model (CDM), considering down-rank choices as occurring in the context
of earlier up-rank choices. Second, we consider stratifying the choice modeling
by rank, regularizing rank-adjacent models towards one another when
appropriate. Using data on household preferences from the San Francisco Unified
School District (SFUSD) across multiple years, we show that the contextual
models considerably improve our out-of-sample evaluation metrics across all
rank positions over the non-contextual models in the literature. Meanwhile,
stratifying the model by rank can yield more accurate first-choice predictions
while down-rank predictions are relatively unimproved. These models provide
performance upgrades that school choice researchers can adopt to improve
predictions and counterfactual analyses.

mixture of prebiotically synthesized biomolecules could attain a homochiral
state at the network level. Based on our recent results, we aim to address a
related question of how chiral information might have flowed in a prebiotic
network. Utilizing the crystallization properties of the central RNA precursor
known as ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO), we showed that its homochiral crystals
can be obtained from its fully racemic solution on a magnetic mineral surface,
due to the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. Moreover, we
uncovered a mechanism facilitated by the CISS effect through which chiral
molecules, like RAO, can uniformly magnetize such surfaces in a variety of
planetary environments in a persistent manner. All this is very tantalizing,
because recent experiments with tRNA analogs demonstrate high stereoselectivity
in the attachment of L-amino acids to D-ribonucleotides, enabling the transfer
of homochirality from RNA to peptides. Therefore the biological homochirality
problem may be reduced to ensuring that a single common RNA precursor (e.g.
RAO) can be made homochiral. The emergence of homochirality at RAO then allows
for the chiral information to propagate through RNA, then to peptides, and
ultimately, through enantioselective catalysis, to metabolites. This
directionality of the chiral information flow parallels that of the central
dogma of molecular biology--the unidirectional transfer of genetic information
from nucleic acids to proteins.

aligning the gradients of a reward function -- parametrized by a neural network

correct reward functions in navigation environments, and we demonstrate that
steering the base model with the learned reward functions results in
significantly increased performance in standard locomotion benchmarks. Finally,

surface-level nutrition content assessments. In this study, we explore the use
of generative AI methods to extend current food computation models, primarily
involving the analysis of nutrition and ingredients, to also incorporate
cooking actions (e.g., add salt, fry the meat, boil the vegetables, etc.).
Cooking actions are notoriously hard to model using statistical learning
methods due to irregular data patterns - significantly varying natural language
descriptions for the same action (e.g., marinate the meat vs. marinate the meat
and leave overnight) and infrequently occurring patterns (e.g., add salt occurs
far more frequently than marinating the meat). The prototypical approach to
handling irregular data patterns is to increase the volume of data that the
model ingests by orders of magnitude. Unfortunately, in the cooking domain,
these problems are further compounded with larger data volumes presenting a
unique challenge that is not easily handled by simply scaling up. In this work,
we propose novel aggregation-based generative AI methods, Cook-Gen, that
reliably generate cooking actions from recipes, despite difficulties with
irregular data patterns, while also outperforming Large Language Models and

Accurately detecting the location, shape, and afflicted regions of blood
vessels from a diverse range of medical images has proven to be a major
challenge. Obtaining blood vessels that retain their correct topological
structures is currently a crucial research issue. Numerous efforts have sought
to reinforce neural networks' learning of vascular geometric features,
including measures to ensure the correct topological structure of the
segmentation result's vessel centerline. Typically, these methods extract
topological features from the network's segmentation result and then apply
regular constraints to reinforce the accuracy of critical components and the
overall topological structure. However, as blood vessels are three-dimensional
structures, it is essential to achieve complete local vessel segmentation,
which necessitates enhancing the segmentation of vessel boundaries.
Furthermore, current methods are limited to handling 2D blood vessel
fragmentation cases. Our proposed boundary attention module directly extracts
boundary voxels from the network's segmentation result. Additionally, we have
established an optimal connection model based on minimal surfaces to determine
the connection order between blood vessels. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in 3D multi-class vascular segmentation tasks, as
evidenced by the high values of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and
Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) metrics. Furthermore, our approach improves the
Betti error, LR error, and BR error indicators of vessel richness and
structural integrity by more than 10% compared to other methods, and
effectively addresses vessel fragmentation and yields blood vessels with a more

adding non-linearity into the output can have a big impact on how effectively
deep learning networks perform. Developing activation functions that can adapt
simultaneously with learning is a need of time. Researchers recently started
developing activation functions that can be trained throughout the learning
process, known as trainable, or adaptive activation functions (AAF). Research
on AAF that enhance the outcomes is still in its early stages. In this paper, a
novel activation function 'ErfReLU' has been developed based on the erf
function and ReLU. This function exploits the ReLU and the error function (erf)
to its advantage. State of art activation functions like Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh,
and their properties have been briefly explained. Adaptive activation functions
like Tanhsoft1, Tanhsoft2, Tanhsoft3, TanhLU, SAAF, ErfAct, Pserf, Smish, and
Serf have also been described. Lastly, performance analysis of 9 trainable
activation functions along with the proposed one namely Tanhsoft1, Tanhsoft2,
Tanhsoft3, TanhLU, SAAF, ErfAct, Pserf, Smish, and Serf has been shown by
applying these activation functions in MobileNet, VGG16, and ResNet models on
CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST benchmark datasets.

  feedback","25 pages 10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The emergence of collective oscillations and synchronization is a widespread
phenomenon in complex systems. While widely studied in dynamical systems
theory, this phenomenon is not well understood in the context of
out-of-equilibrium phase transitions. Here we consider classical lattice
models, namely the Ising, the Blume-Capel and the Potts models, with a feedback
among the order and control parameters. With linear response theory we derive
low-dimensional dynamical systems for mean field cases that quantitatively
reproduce many-body stochastic simulations. In general, we find that the usual
equilibrium phase transitions are taken over by complex bifurcations where
self-oscillations emerge, a behavior that we illustrate by the feedback Landau
theory. For the case of the Ising model, we obtain that the bifurcation that
takes over the critical point is non-trivial in finite dimensions. We provide
numerical evidence that in 2D the most probable value of the amplitude follows
the Onsager law. We illustrate multi-stability for the case of discontinuously
emerging oscillations in the Blume-Capel model, whose tricritical point is
substituted by the Bautin bifurcation. For the Potts model with q = 3 colors we
highlight the appearance of two mirror stable limit cycles at a bifurcation
line and characterize the onset of chaotic oscillations that emerge at low
temperature through either the Feigenbaum cascade of period doubling or the
Aifraimovich-Shilnikov scenario of a torus destruction. We show that entropy
production singularities as a function of the temperature correspond to change
in the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Our results show that mean-field
behaviour can be described by the bifurcation theory of low-dimensional
dynamical systems, which paves the way for the definition of universality
classes of collective oscillations.

  Alignment Generation",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.CE cs.LG q-bio.BM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The field of protein folding research has been greatly advanced by deep
learning methods, with AlphaFold2 (AF2) demonstrating exceptional performance
and atomic-level precision. As co-evolution is integral to protein structure
prediction, AF2's accuracy is significantly influenced by the depth of multiple
sequence alignment (MSA), which requires extensive exploration of a large
protein database for similar sequences. However, not all protein sequences
possess abundant homologous families, and consequently, AF2's performance can
degrade on such queries, at times failing to produce meaningful results. To
address this, we introduce a novel generative language model, MSA-Augmenter,
which leverages protein-specific attention mechanisms and large-scale MSAs to
generate useful, novel protein sequences not currently found in databases.
These sequences supplement shallow MSAs, enhancing the accuracy of structural
property predictions. Our experiments on CASP14 demonstrate that MSA-Augmenter
can generate de novo sequences that retain co-evolutionary information from
inferior MSAs, thereby improving protein structure prediction quality on top of
strong AF2.

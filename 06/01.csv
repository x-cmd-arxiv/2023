also be used to improve ASR performance in many scenarios. In this paper, we
first propose a multimodal ASR model (ViLaS) that can simultaneously or
separately integrate visual and linguistic cues to help recognize the input

modal-incomplete test scenarios. Then, we create a multimodal ASR dataset

the complex galaxy formation scenario posited by standard cosmology. This is
particularly apparent in their dynamics, where scaling relations display much
regularity and little intrinsic scatter. However, the parameters responsible
for this simplicity have not been identified. Using the Spitzer Photometry &
Accurate Rotation Curves galaxy catalogue, we argue that the radial
acceleration relation (RAR) between galaxies' baryonic and total dynamical
accelerations is the fundamental correlation governing the radial (in-disk)
dynamics of late-type galaxies. In particular, we show that the RAR cannot be
tightened by the inclusion of any other available galaxy property, that it is
the strongest projection of galaxies' radial dynamical parameter space, and
that all other statistical radial dynamical correlations stem from the RAR plus
the non-dynamical correlations present in our sample. We further provide
evidence that the RAR's fundamentality is unique in that the second most
significant dynamical relation does not possess any of these features. Our
analysis reveals the root cause of the correlations present in galaxies' radial
dynamics: they are nothing but facets of the RAR. These results have important
ramifications for galaxy formation theory because they imply that to explain
statistically late-type galaxy dynamics within the disk it is necessary and
sufficient to explain the RAR and lack of any significant, partially
independent correlation. While simple in some modified dynamics models, this
poses a challenge to standard cosmology.

three gravitational degrees of freedom of these ``TRIMOND'' theories are the
MOND potential and two auxiliary potentials, one of which emerges as the
Newtonian potential. Their Lagrangians involve a function of three acceleration
variables -- the gradients of the potentials. So, the transition from the
Newtonian to the MOND regime is rather richer than in the aquadratic-Lagrangian
theory (AQUAL) and the quasilinear MOND theory (QUMOND), which are special
cases of TRIMOND, each defined by a Lagrangian function of a single variable.
In particular, unlike AQUAL and QUMOND whose deep-MOND limit (DML) is fully
dictated by the required scale invariance, here, the scale-invariant DML still
requires specifying a function of two variables. For one-dimensional (e.g.,
spherical) mass distributions, in all TRIMOND theories the MOND acceleration is
a (theory specific, but system independent) function of the Newtonian
acceleration; their variety appears in nonsymmetric situations. Also, they all
make the salient, primary MOND predictions. For example, they predict the same
DML virial relation as AQUAL and QUMOND, and thus the same DML $M-\sigma$
relation, and the same DML two-body force. Yet they can differ materially on
secondary predictions. Such TRIMOND theories may be the nonrelativistic limits
of scalar-bimetric relativistic formulations of MOND, such as BIMOND with an

role of resampling in population annealing which this work attempts to close.
The two-dimensional Ising model is used as a benchmarking system for this
study. At first various resampling methods are implemented and numerically
compared. In a second part the exact solution of the Ising model is utilized to
create an artificial population annealing setting with effectively infinite
Monte Carlo updates at each temperature. This limit is first performed on
finite population sizes and in a second step extended to infinite populations.
This allows us to look at resampling isolated from other parameters. Many
results are expected to generalize to other systems.

scale EHRs have become another rich data source for translational clinical
research. Despite its potential, deriving generalizable knowledge from EHR data
remains challenging. First, EHR data are generated as part of clinical care
with data elements too detailed and fragmented for research. Despite recent
progress in mapping EHR data to common ontology with hierarchical structures,
much development is still needed to enable automatic grouping of local EHR
codes to meaningful clinical concepts at a large scale. Second, the total
number of unique EHR features is large, imposing methodological challenges to
derive reproducible knowledge graph, especially when interest lies in
conditional dependency structure. Third, the detailed EHR data on a very large
patient cohort imposes additional computational challenge to deriving a
knowledge network. To overcome these challenges, we propose to infer the
conditional dependency structure among EHR features via a latent graphical
block model (LGBM). The LGBM has a two layer structure with the first providing
semantic embedding vector (SEV) representation for the EHR features and the
second overlaying a graphical block model on the latent SEVs. The block
structures on the graphical model also allows us to cluster synonymous features
in EHR. We propose to learn the LGBM efficiently, in both statistical and
computational sense, based on the empirical point mutual information matrix. We
establish the statistical rates of the proposed estimators and show the perfect
recovery of the block structure. Numerical results from simulation studies and
real EHR data analyses suggest that the proposed LGBM estimator performs well
in finite sample.

However, we show that the estimated Shapley Values are sensitive to random seed

mitigated by aggregating thousands of model evaluations, which on the other

predicts each input feature's Shapley Value without additional model
evaluations. It is trained on a set of examples whose Shapley Values are
estimated from a large number of model evaluations to ensure stability.
Experimental results on two text classification datasets demonstrate that our

experimental data, are ubiquitous in science and engineering. The Bayesian
formulation is the gold standard because it alleviates ill-posedness issues and
quantifies epistemic uncertainty. Since analytical posteriors are not typically
available, one resorts to Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling or approximate
variational inference. However, inference needs to be rerun from scratch for
each new set of data. This drawback limits the applicability of the Bayesian
formulation to real-time settings, e.g., health monitoring of engineered
systems, and medical diagnosis. The objective of this paper is to develop a
methodology that enables real-time inference by learning the Bayesian inverse
map, i.e., the map from data to posteriors. Our approach is as follows. We
represent the posterior distribution using a parameterization based on deep
neural networks. Next, we learn the network parameters by amortized variational
inference method which involves maximizing the expectation of evidence lower
bound over all possible datasets compatible with the model. We demonstrate our
approach by solving examples a set of benchmark problems from science and

in agreement with the corresponding ground truth obtained by Markov chain Monte
Carlo. Once trained, our approach provides the posterior parameters of
observation just at the cost of a forward pass of the neural network.

quasars (QSOs), of which over 99% are anticipated to be found at redshifts
greater than z < 0.3, such that DESI would be able to observe an associated or
intervening Mg II absorber illuminated by the background QSO. We have developed
an autonomous supplementary spectral pipeline that detects such systems through
an initial line-fitting process and then confirms line properties using a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler. Based upon both a visual inspection
and the reanalysis of coadded observations, we estimate this sample of
absorption systems to have a completeness of 82.56% and purity of 99.08%. As
the spectra in which Mg II systems are detected are the result of coadding
multiple observations, we can determine the sensitivity, and therefore
completeness, of the sample by searching for known Mg II systems in coadded
data with fewer observations (and therefore lower signal-to-noise). From a
parent catalog containing 83,207 quasars, we detect a total of 23,921 Mg II
absorption systems following a series of quality cuts. Extrapolating from this
occurrence rate of 28.75% implies a catalog at the completion of the five-year
DESI survey that contains over eight hundred thousand Mg II absorbers. The
cataloging of these systems will enable significant further research as they
carry information regarding circumgalactic medium (CGM) environments, the
distribution of intervening galaxies, and the growth of metallicity across the
redshift range 0.3 < z < 2.5.

scalable, semi-supervised method for training a neural semantic parser.
Conceptually, LOCCO can be viewed as a form of self-learning where the semantic
parser being trained is used to generate annotations for unlabeled text that
are then used as new supervision. To increase the quality of annotations, our
method utilizes a count-based prior over valid formal meaning representations
and a cycle-consistency score produced by a neural text generation model as
additional signals. Both the prior and semantic parser are updated in an
alternate fashion from full passes over the training data, which can be seen as
approximating the marginalization of latent structures through stochastic
variational inference. The use of a count-based prior, frozen text generation
model, and offline annotation process yields an approach with negligible
complexity and latency increases as compared to conventional self-learning. As
an added bonus, the annotations produced by LOCCO can be trivially repurposed
to train a neural text generation model. We demonstrate the utility of LOCCO on
the well-known WebNLG benchmark where we obtain an improvement of 2 points
against a self-learning parser under equivalent conditions, an improvement of
1.3 points against the previous state-of-the-art parser, and competitive text

constitute the computational domain, whereas independent patches are coupled
through visible interfaces using Nitsche's formulation. Such a geometric
representation inevitably involves trimming, which may yield trimmed elements
of extremely small measures (referred to as bad elements) and thus lead to the
instability issue. Motivated by the minimal stabilization method that
rigorously guarantees stability for trimmed geometries [1], in this work we
generalize it to the Stokes problem on overlapping patches. Central to our
method is the distinct treatments for the pressure and velocity spaces:
Stabilization for velocity is carried out for the flux terms on interfaces,
whereas pressure is stabilized in all the bad elements. We provide a priori
error estimates with a comprehensive theoretical study. Through a suite of
numerical tests, we first show that optimal convergence rates are achieved,
which consistently agrees with our theoretical findings. Second, we show that

introduce the IoT data sharing mode to drive data circulation. To enhance the
accuracy and fairness of IoT data sharing, the heterogeneity of participants is
sufficiently considered, and data valuation and profit allocation in IoT data
sharing are improved based on the background of electricity retail. Data
valuation is supposed to be relevant to attributes of IoT data buyers, thus
risk preferences of electricity retailers are applied as characteristic

Profit allocation should measure the marginal contribution shares of

the heterogeneity of participants comprehensively, the proposed IoT data

validate the results of data value for electricity retailers with different

high-quality Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, low-cost stochastic MCMC, and heuristics

the ranking of methods is highly problem dependent, suggesting the need for
tailored inductive biases; (ii) HMC is the most successful approximate

inverting the diffusion process to retrieve the noise vector, which is then

couples gas to stellar radiation fields, allowing radiation feedback to
influence gas fragmentation and thus the stellar initial mass function (IMF).
Variations in dust abundance therefore provide a potential avenue by which
variation in galaxy metallicity might affect the IMF. In this paper we present
a series of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations in which we vary the
metallicity and thus the dust abundance from 1% of Solar to 3$\times$ Solar,
spanning the range from the lowest metallicity dwarfs to the most metal-rich
early-type galaxies found in the local Universe. We design the simulations to
keep all dimensionless parameters constant so that the interaction between
feedback and star-forming environments of varying surface density and
metallicity is the only factor capable of breaking the symmetry between the
simulations and modifying the IMF, allowing us to cleanly isolate and
understand the effects of each environmental parameter. We find that at a fixed
surface density more metal-rich clouds tend to form a slightly more
bottom-heavy IMF than metal-poor ones, primarily because in metal-poor gas
radiation feedback is able to propagate further, heating somewhat larger
volumes of gas. However, shifts in IMF with metallicity at a fixed surface
density are much smaller than shifts with surface density at fixed metallicity;
metallicity-induced IMF variations are too small to explain the variations in
mass-to-light ratio reported in galaxies of different mass and metallicity. We,
therefore, conclude that metallicity variations are much less important than
variations in surface density in driving changes in the IMF and that the latter
rather than the former are most likely responsible for the IMF variations found
in early-type galaxies.

one-dimensional systems; the unambiguous experimental realization of QSL

novel compound YbZn2GaO5, which hosts an ideal triangular lattice of effective

inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements performed on high-quality
single crystal samples of YbZn2GaO5 exclude the possibility of long-range

Brillouin zone. Both low-temperature thermodynamics and INS spectra suggest
that YbZn2GaO5 is a U(1) Dirac QSL with gapless spinon excitations concentrated
at certain points in the Brillouin zone, and additional features in INS are
also consistent with theoretical expectations for a Dirac QSL on the triangular

uncertainty quantification in the context of visual localization for autonomous

estimates probabilistic uncertainty by creating a sensor error model that maps
an internal output of the prediction model to the uncertainty. The sensor error
model is created using multiple image databases of visual localization, each

prediction framework using the Ithaca365 dataset, which includes variations in

a Kalman-based localization filter. Our results show that prediction error
variations increase with poor weather and lighting condition, leading to
greater uncertainty and outliers, which can be predicted by our proposed

filter to remove ad hoc sensor gating, as the uncertainty automatically adjusts

propose a hybrid vision-language training strategy to learn object detection

users can not only detect objects with class names, but also able to localize

Despite their popularity, the effect that different deep features and their

the creation of synthetic counterfactual faces using deep face generators. Our

the eyes and mouth. Moreover, FD using features from a face gender classifier
emphasize hair length more than distances in an identity (recognition) feature

the diffusion model block, we integrate the guidance and other auxiliary
conditional information into every block of the diffusion model to achieve
spatially-adaptive generation conditioning. To handle high-resolution images,
we propose a simple yet effective inter-step patch-splitting strategy to
produce arbitrary-resolution images without grid artifacts. We evaluate our
conditional framework on three challenging tasks: extreme low-light denoising,
deblurring, and JPEG restoration, demonstrating its significant improvements in
perceptual quality and the generalization to restoration tasks.

where the output logit changes minimally along the path provide poor
explanations for the model decision, which is called the saturation effect
problem. In this paper, we propose an attribution algorithm called integrated

of the output logit with respect to the path. The algorithm thereby provides a
principled solution to the saturation problem. Additionally, we minimize the

non-uniform subdivisions determined by adaptive sampling. In the evaluation on

(RF) frames is a pivotal step of ultrasound elastography, which depicts tissue
mechanical properties to identify pathologies. Due to ultrasound's poor ability
to capture information pertaining to the lateral direction, the existing
displacement estimation techniques fail to generate an accurate lateral
displacement or strain map. The attempts made in the literature to mitigate
this well-known issue suffer from one of the following limitations: 1) Sampling
size is substantially increased, rendering the method computationally and
memory expensive. 2) The lateral displacement estimation entirely depends on
the axial one, ignoring data fidelity and creating large errors. This paper
proposes exploiting the effective Poisson's ratio (EPR)-based mechanical
correspondence between the axial and lateral strains along with the RF data
fidelity and displacement continuity to improve the lateral displacement and
strain estimation accuracies. We call our techniques MechSOUL
(Mechanically-constrained Second-Order Ultrasound eLastography) and L1-MechSOUL
(L1-norm-based MechSOUL), which optimize L2- and L1-norm-based penalty
functions, respectively. Extensive validation experiments with simulated,
phantom, and in vivo datasets demonstrate that MechSOUL and L1-MechSOUL's
lateral strain and EPR estimation abilities are substantially superior to those
of the recently-published elastography techniques. We have published the MATLAB
codes of MechSOUL and L1-MechSOUL at http://code.sonography.ai.

capabilities of today's foundation models, we leverage Large Language Models to
generate follow-up questions to an initial image description. These questions
form a dialog with the user in order to retrieve the desired image from a large
corpus. In this study, we explore the capabilities of such a system tested on a
large dataset and reveal that engaging in a dialog yields significant gains in
image retrieval. We start by building an evaluation pipeline from an existing
manually generated dataset and explore different modules and training
strategies for ChatIR. Our comparison includes strong baselines derived from
related applications trained with Reinforcement Learning. Our system is capable
of retrieving the target image from a pool of 50K images with over 78% success

with the environment. Due to the curse of dimensionality, learning policies
that map high-dimensional sensory input to motor output is particularly
challenging. During training, state of the art methods (SAC, PPO, etc.) explore
the environment by perturbing the actuation with independent Gaussian noise.
While this unstructured exploration has proven successful in numerous tasks, it
ought to be suboptimal for overactuated systems. When multiple actuators, such
as motors or muscles, drive behavior, uncorrelated perturbations risk
diminishing each other's effect, or modifying the behavior in a task-irrelevant
way. While solutions to introduce time correlation across action perturbations
exist, introducing correlation across actuators has been largely ignored. Here,
we propose LATent TIme-Correlated Exploration (Lattice), a method to inject
temporally-correlated noise into the latent state of the policy network, which
can be seamlessly integrated with on- and off-policy algorithms. We demonstrate
that the noisy actions generated by perturbing the network's activations can be
modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix.
In the PyBullet locomotion tasks, Lattice-SAC achieves state of the art
results, and reaches 18% higher reward than unstructured exploration in the
Humanoid environment. In the musculoskeletal control environments of MyoSuite,
Lattice-PPO achieves higher reward in most reaching and object manipulation

vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-lane interactions, plays a critical role in
many driving tasks such as trajectory prediction and motion planning.
Environment information comes from high-definition (HD) map and historical
trajectories of vehicles. Due to the heterogeneity of the map data and
trajectory data, many data-driven models for trajectory prediction and motion
planning extract vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-lane interactions in a
separate and sequential manner. However, such a manner may capture biased
interpretation of interactions, causing lower prediction and planning accuracy.
Moreover, separate extraction leads to a complicated model structure and hence
the overall efficiency and scalability are sacrificed. To address the above
issues, we propose an environment representation, Temporal Occupancy Flow Graph
(TOFG). Specifically, the occupancy flow-based representation unifies the map
information and vehicle trajectories into a homogeneous data format and enables
a consistent prediction. The temporal dependencies among vehicles can help
capture the change of occupancy flow timely to further promote model
performance. To demonstrate that TOFG is capable of simplifying the model
architecture, we incorporate TOFG with a simple graph attention (GAT) based
neural network and propose TOFG-GAT, which can be used for both trajectory
prediction and motion planning. Experiment results show that TOFG-GAT achieves
better or competitive performance than all the SOTA baselines with less
training time.

this paradigm to the time dimension can further lead to an exotic dynamical
phase, the time crystal, which spontaneously breaks the time translation
symmetry of the system [1]. While the existence of a continuous time crystal at
equilibrium has been challenged by the no-go theorems [2, 3], the difficulty
can be circumvented by the dissipation in an open system. Here, we report the
experimental observation of such a dissipative time crystalline order in a
room-temperature atomic gas, where ground-state atoms are continuously driven
to Rydberg states via electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The
emergent time crystal is revealed by persistent oscillations of the probe-field
transmission, with ultralong lifetime and no observable damping during the
measurement. We show that the observed limit cycles arise from the coexistence
and competition between distinct Rydberg components, in agreement with a
mean-field analysis derived from the microscopic model. The random phase
distribution of the oscillation for repeated realizations, together with the
robustness against temporal noises further supports our realization of a
dissipative time crystal.

address whether the small-scale effects, specifically the quantum pressure,
could leave sizable imprints on the large-scale statistics of the matter. For
this purpose, We utilize the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structures
(EFT of LSS) wherein small-scale physics is integrated and represented on large
scales by only a set of free parameters. These parameters can be determined by
fitting to the cosmological simulations. We use the \textit{Gadget-2} code to
study the evolution of $512^3$ particles in a box of side length
$250\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$. Fitting EFT predictions to the simulation data, we
determine the value of the speed of sound. We use the suppressed FDM initial
conditions for the FDM case, sufficient to produce accurate -- enough for our
purpose -- results on large scales. We perform three FDM simulations with
different masses and compare their sound speed with the standard cold dark
matter (CDM) simulation. We found that the FDM sound speed is slightly higher
than CDM's. The deviation of the sound speed for FDM from CDM is larger for
lower FDM masses. We conclude that the impact of the FDM is not limited to the
small scales alone, and we can search for them by studying the matter on large
scales. Though it is beyond the observations' scope today, it is possible to
discriminate it with upcoming observations.

offline datasets, where the parameterization of policies is crucial but often
overlooked. Recently, Diffsuion-QL significantly boosts the performance of
offline RL by representing a policy with a diffusion model, whose success
relies on a parametrized Markov Chain with hundreds of steps for sampling.
However, Diffusion-QL suffers from two critical limitations. 1) It is
computationally inefficient to forward and backward through the whole Markov
chain during training. 2) It is incompatible with maximum likelihood-based RL
algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods) as the likelihood of diffusion
models is intractable. Therefore, we propose efficient diffusion policy (EDP)
to overcome these two challenges. EDP approximately constructs actions from
corrupted ones at training to avoid running the sampling chain. We conduct
extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark. The results show that EDP can
reduce the diffusion policy training time from 5 days to 5 hours on
gym-locomotion tasks. Moreover, we show that EDP is compatible with various
offline RL algorithms (TD3, CRR, and IQL) and achieves new state-of-the-art on
D4RL by large margins over previous methods. Our code is available at

Control4D is built upon an efficient 4D representation with a 2D

our method learns a 4D GAN from it and avoids the inconsistent supervision
signals. Specifically, we employ a discriminator to learn the generation
distribution based on the edited images and then update the generator with the
discrimination signals. For more stable training, multi-level information is
extracted from the edited images and used to facilitate the learning of the

develop methodology for the efficient implementation of discrete Hawkes

TL;DR enables us to reduce the large dataset into a small set of high-quality

effective and scalable methods for training transferable vision models using

exclusively applied to image inputs, while language inputs remain unchanged
throughout the entire training process, limiting the exposure of diverse texts
to the same image. In this paper, we introduce Language augmented CLIP
(LaCLIP), a simple yet highly effective approach to enhance CLIP training
through language rewrites. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of
large language models, we rewrite the text descriptions associated with each
image. These rewritten texts exhibit diversity in sentence structure and
vocabulary while preserving the original key concepts and meanings. During
training, LaCLIP randomly selects either the original texts or the rewritten
versions as text augmentations for each image. Extensive experiments on CC3M,
CC12M, RedCaps and LAION-400M datasets show that CLIP pre-training with
language rewrites significantly improves the transfer performance without
computation or memory overhead during training. Specifically for ImageNet
zero-shot accuracy, LaCLIP outperforms CLIP by 8.2% on CC12M and 2.4% on

yet challenging task. In this task, contacts between hands and objects provide
important cues for recovering the 3D geometry of the hand-held objects. Though
recent works have employed implicit functions to achieve impressive progress,
they ignore formulating contacts in their frameworks, which results in
producing less realistic object meshes. In this work, we explore how to model
contacts in an explicit way to benefit the implicit reconstruction of hand-held
objects. Our method consists of two components: explicit contact prediction and
implicit shape reconstruction. In the first part, we propose a new subtask of
directly estimating 3D hand-object contacts from a single image. The part-level
and vertex-level graph-based transformers are cascaded and jointly learned in a
coarse-to-fine manner for more accurate contact probabilities. In the second
part, we introduce a novel method to diffuse estimated contact states from the
hand mesh surface to nearby 3D space and leverage diffused contact
probabilities to construct the implicit neural representation for the
manipulated object. Benefiting from estimating the interaction patterns between
the hand and the object, our method can reconstruct more realistic object
meshes, especially for object parts that are in contact with hands. Extensive
experiments on challenging benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms
the current state of the arts by a great margin.

large numbers of measurements. These phenomena are difficult to observe in
conventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of
measurement from dephasing, it is necessary to post-select on sets of
measurement outcomes whose Born probabilities are exponentially small in the
number of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this
exponential `post-selection problem', is to construct cross-correlations
between experimental data and the results of simulations on classical
computers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite
relation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate shadow
tomography into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of
quantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify
cross-correlations which both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged
von Neumann entanglement entropy. These bounds show that experiments can be
performed to constrain post-measurement entanglement without the need for
post-selection. To illustrate our technique we consider how it could be used to
observe the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum
circuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum
simulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory,
we construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond
dimension. Our results reveal a signature of measurement-induced criticality
that can be observed using a quantum simulator in polynomial time and with
polynomial classical memory.

this paper is threefold: (1) We proposed a molecular-empowered learning scheme
for multi-class cell segmentation using partial labels from lay annotators; (2)
The proposed method integrated Giga-pixel level molecular-morphology
cross-modality registration, molecular-informed annotation, and
molecular-oriented segmentation model, so as to achieve significantly superior
performance via 3 lay annotators as compared with 2 experienced pathologists;
(3) A deep corrective learning (learning with imperfect label) method is

achieved F1 = 0.8496 using molecular-informed annotations from lay annotators,
which is better than conventional morphology-based annotations (F1 = 0.7051)

shifts which are sufficiently large for these binaries to be missed by binary
black hole (BBH) templated searches. In this paper, we conduct a search using

light fields present during inflation can generate important isocurvature
perturbations also in scenarios of low-scale inflation. In our mechanism, the
axion field starts with some non-zero field value during inflation and rolls
along its potential. Since inflation has a different duration in different
patches of the universe, different regions will then have different values of
the axion field, generating cold dark matter isocurvature modes. These modes
are fully correlated with the adiabatic ones and share the same spectral index.
In this scenario, the axion mass determines a lower bound on the Hubble

For an appropriate choice of initial states, the LXE distinguishes the

the LXE exhibits universal behavior which depends sensitively on boundary
conditions, and the choice of initial states. With open boundary conditions, we
show that the LXE relates to crossing probabilities in critical percolation,
and is thus given by a known universal function of the aspect ratio of the
dynamics, which quantitatively agrees with numerical studies of the LXE at
criticality. The LXE probes correlations of other operators in percolation with
periodic boundary conditions. We show that the LXE is sensitive to the richer

Specifically, we show that distributions of metallicity [Fe/H], energy, the

match the corresponding distributions of stars of the Aurora population and of

epochs when metallicity evolves from $\rm [Fe/H]=-1.5$ to $\rm [Fe/H]=-0.9$,
the Galaxy spins up and transitions from a turbulent Aurora state to a

that following the training phase of a quantum model, a quantum computer could

semimetals relating to the separation of the Weyl nodes in energy and in

corresponding collective excitations. When the inherent chiral symmetry of Weyl
semimetals is spontaneously broken by the formation of CDW order, the resultant
chiral condensate is endowed with intrinsic dynamics which yields a dynamical
contribution to the axion field. However, unambiguous identification of this
dynamical axion mode is challenging due to its inherent nonlinear coupling to
electromagnetic fields. Therefore, we propose an all-optical protocol for
verifying and characterizing dynamical axion collective modes in Weyl

with opposite momenta bind into Cooper pairs due to an attractive interaction
mediated by phonons in the material. While superconductivity naturally emerges
at thermal equilibrium, it can also emerge out of equilibrium when the system's
parameters are abruptly changed. The resulting out-of-equilibrium phases are
predicted to occur in real materials and ultracold fermionic atoms but have not
yet been directly observed. This work realizes an alternate way to generate the
proposed dynamical phases using cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED).
Our system encodes the presence or absence of a Cooper pair in a long-lived
electronic transition in $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to an optical cavity and
represents interactions between electrons as photon-mediated interactions
through the cavity. To fully explore the phase diagram, we manipulate the ratio
between the single-particle dispersion and the interactions after a quench and
perform real-time tracking of subsequent dynamics of the superconducting order
parameter using non-destructive measurements. We observe regimes where the
order parameter decays to zero (""phase I""), assumes a non-equilibrium
steady-state value (""phase II""), or exhibits persistent oscillations (""phase
III"") in the form of a self-generated Floquet phase. The capability to emulate
these dynamical phases in optical cavities without real Cooper pairs
demonstrates that programmable simulators can overcome many challenges faced by
traditional approaches. This opens up exciting prospects for quantum

that are only indirectly correlated through secondary dependencies. We find
that, once galactic inclination is controlled for, dust attenuation depends
primarily on stellar mass, followed by metallicity and velocity dispersion.
Once the dependence on these quantities is taken into account, there is no
dependence on star formation rate. While the dependence on stellar mass and
metallicity was expected based on simple analytical equations for the
interstellar medium, the dependence on velocity dispersion was not predicted
and we discuss possible scenarios to explain it. We identify a projection of
this multi-dimensional parameters space which minimises the dispersion in terms

ladder and the determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). First, we show
that the \texttt{Pantheon+} covariance model modestly overestimates the
uncertainty of standardized magnitudes by $\sim 7$%, in the parameter space
used by the $\texttt{SH0ES}$ Team to measure $H_0$; accounting for this alone
yields $H_0 = 73.01 \pm 0.92$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Furthermore, accounting
for spectroscopic similarity between SNe~Ia on the distance ladder reduces
their relative scatter to $\sim0.12$ mag per object (compared to $\sim 0.14$

There is a further requirement that thermal de-phasing of the Josephson

typically provides both a label prediction and a confidence value. Then, the

trust the prediction. In this context, it has been often argued that the
confidence value should correspond to a well calibrated estimate of the
probability that the predicted label matches the ground truth label. However,
multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest that decision makers have
difficulties at developing a good sense on when to trust a prediction using
these confidence values. In this paper, our goal is first to understand why and
then investigate how to construct more useful confidence values. We first argue
that, for a broad class of utility functions, there exist data distributions
for which a rational decision maker is, in general, unlikely to discover the
optimal decision policy using the above confidence values -- an optimal
decision maker would need to sometimes place more (less) trust on predictions
with lower (higher) confidence values. However, we then show that, if the
confidence values satisfy a natural alignment property with respect to the
decision maker's confidence on her own predictions, there always exists an
optimal decision policy under which the level of trust the decision maker would
need to place on predictions is monotone on the confidence values, facilitating
its discoverability. Further, we show that multicalibration with respect to the
decision maker's confidence on her own predictions is a sufficient condition
for alignment. Experiments on four different AI-assisted decision making tasks
where a classifier provides decision support to real human experts validate our
theoretical results and suggest that alignment may lead to better decisions.

associated with a prompt short gamma-ray burst (GRB), an optical kilonova, and
the afterglow of a structured, off-axis relativistic jet. We model the
prospects for future mergers discovered in gravitational waves to produce
detectable afterglows. Using a model fit to GW170817, we assume all BNS mergers
produce jets with the same parameters, and model the afterglow luminosity for a
full distribution of observer angles, ISM densities, and distances. We find
that in the LIGO/Virgo O4 run, 30% - 50% of BNS mergers with a well-localized
counterpart will have an afterglow detectable with current instrumentation in
the X-ray, radio and optical. Without a previously detected counterpart, up to
18% will have an afterglow detectable by wide-area radio and optical surveys,
compared to only about 5% of events expected to have bright (on-axis) gamma-ray
emission. Therefore, most afterglows that are detected will be from off-axis
jets. Further in the future, in the A+ era (O5), 50% - 60% of mergers will have
afterglows detectable with next-generation X-ray and radio instruments. Future
wide-area radio survey instruments, particularly DSA-2000, could detect 50% of

We obtain redshift distributions for the simulated FRBs and the fraction with

formation rate or stellar mass, 20 to 40 per cent of CHIME FRB hosts will be

environments, with active stress showing more muted variations across
conditions. The presented model also enables us to dissect the relative

short of that required to sustain star formation for cosmological timescales. A
potential avenue for this unseen accretion is an inflow in the volume-filling
hot phase ($\sim10^6$ K) of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), as suggested by
some cosmological simulations. We derive an approximate axisymmetric analytic
solution of such hot CGM accretion flows, and validate it with hydrodynamic
simulations. We show that a hot inflow spins up as it approaches the galaxy,
while remaining hot, subsonic and quasi-spherical. At the radius of angular
momentum support ($\approx15$ kpc for the Milky-Way) the hot flow flattens into
a disk geometry and then cools from $\sim10^6$ K to $\sim10^4$ K at the
disk-halo interface. Cooling affects all hot gas, rather than just a subset of
individual gas clouds, implying that accretion via hot inflows does not rely on
local thermal instability in contrast with 'precipitation' models for galaxy
accretion. Prior to cooling and accretion the inflow completes $\sim t_{\rm
cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ radians of rotation, where $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ is the
cooling time to free-fall time ratio in hot gas immediately outside the galaxy.
The ratio $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ may thus govern the development of
turbulence and enhancement of magnetic fields in gas accreting onto
low-redshift spirals. We argue that accretion via hot inflows can explain the
observed truncation of nearby thin stellar disks at $\approx4$ disk radii. We
also show that if rotating hot inflows are common in Milky-Way size disk
galaxies, as predicted, then signatures should be observable with X-ray
telescopes, kinetic SZ measurements, and FRB surveys.

we develop both a spacetime and a quantum information geometry perspective on

theories admit an alternative but equivalent formulation in terms of a CFT
defined on a spacetime with a time-dependent metric. We prove this equivalence
both in the operator formulation as well as in the path integral description of
the theory. A complementary quantum information geometric perspective for
driven 2d CFTs employs the so-called Bogoliubov-Kubo-Mori (BKM) metric, which
is the counterpart of the Fisher metric of classical information theory, and
which is obtained from a perturbative expansion of relative entropy. We compute
the BKM metric for the universal sector of Virasoro excitations of a thermal
state, which captures a large class of driving protocols, and find it to be a
useful tool to classify and characterize different types of driving. For
M\""obius driving by the SL(2,R) subgroup, the BKM metric becomes the hyperbolic
metric on the unit disk. We show how the non-trivial dynamics of Floquet driven
CFTs is encoded in the BKM geometry via M\""obius transformations. This allows
us to identify ergodic and non-ergodic regimes in the driving. We also explain
how holographic driven CFTs are dual to driven BTZ black holes with evolving
horizons. The deformation of the black hole horizon towards and away from the
asymptotic boundary provides a holographic understanding of heating and cooling

scratch. The system has two main advantages: Firstly, it is data efficient. In
the attribute-to-music generation stage, the attributes can be directly
extracted from music sequences, making the model training self-supervised. In
the text-to-attribute understanding stage, the text is synthesized and refined
by ChatGPT based on the defined attribute templates. Secondly, the system can
achieve precise control with specific attributes in text descriptions and
offers multiple control options through attribute-conditioned or
text-conditioned approaches. MuseCoco outperforms baseline systems in terms of
musicality, controllability, and overall score by at least 1.27, 1.08, and 1.32

control accuracy. In addition, we have developed a robust large-scale model

musicality.

designed to detect radio continuum; the novel aspect of this work is to search
for spectral lines in broadband VLA data (we provide the script developed in
this work to facilitate exploration of other datasets). We report detection of
25$\,$GHz CH$_3$OH transitions toward ten sources; five of them also show
NH$_3$ emission. We found that most of the sources detected in CH$_3$OH and
NH$_3$ have been classified as ionized jets or jet candidates and that the
emission lines are coincident with, or very near ($\lesssim 0.1$ pc) these
sources, hence, these molecular lines could be used as probes of the
environment near the launching site of jets/outflows. No radio recombination
lines were detected, but we found that the RMS noise of stacked spectra
decreases following the radiometer equation. Therefore, detecting radio
recombination lines in a sample of brighter free-free continuum sources should
be possible. This work demonstrates the potential of broadband VLA continuum
observations as low-resolution spectral line scans.

a state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised learning framework, to improve its

one positive pair generated by two augmented views of the same image, we argue
that information from different images with the same label can bring more
diversity and variations to the target features, thus benefiting representation
learning. To identify such pairs without any label, we investigate TracIn, an
instance-based and computationally efficient influence function, for BYOL
training. Specifically, TracIn is a gradient-based method that reveals the
impact of a training sample on a test sample in supervised learning. We extend
it to the self-supervised learning setting and propose an efficient batch-wise
per-sample gradient computation method to estimate the pairwise TracIn to
represent the similarity of samples in the mini-batch during training. For each
image, we select the most similar sample from other images as the additional
positive and pull their features together with BYOL loss. Experimental results
on two public medical datasets (i.e., ISIC 2019 and ChestX-ray) demonstrate
that the proposed method can improve the classification performance compared to
other competitive baselines in both semi-supervised and transfer learning

discovery non-perturbative mechanism capable of giving mass to elementary

the Higgs scenario. We can show that the non-perturbatively generated fermion

$M_W\sim g_w c_w(\alpha)\Lambda_{RGI}$ with $C_f(\alpha)$ and $c_w(\alpha)$
functions of the gauge couplings, $g_w$ the weak coupling and $\Lambda_{RGI}$
the RGI scale of the theory. In view of this parametric dependence we are led
to argue that to get the top quark and electro-weak boson masses of the correct
order of magnitude a realistic model must include an as yet unobserved sector
of massive fermions (Tera-fermions) subjected, besides Standard Model
interactions, to some kind of super-strong gauge interactions

isospin splitting), the present approach offers a radical solution of the Higgs
mass naturalness problem (as there is no fundamental Higgs), an understanding
of the fermion mass hierarchy (as related to the ranking of the magnitude of
the gauge couplings) and a physical interpretation of the electro-weak scale

a simulated annealing based heuristic optimizer. First, to generate a
rectangular space-filling layout of an input graph, we subdivide the 2D

ratios toward a desired aspect ratio. Second, to route graph edges between
rectangles without vertex-edge occlusion, we devise a two-stage algorithm to

to produce and arrange rectangles by considering multiple visual criteria, we
design a simulated annealing based heuristic optimization to adjust vertices'
2D embedding to support trade-offs among aspect ratio quality and the encoding
accuracy of vertices' weights and adjacency. We evaluated the effectiveness of
VMap on both synthetic and application datasets. The resulting rectangular
layout has better aspect ratio quality on synthetic data compared with the
existing method for the rectangular partitioning of 2D points. On three
real-world datasets, VMap achieved better encoding accuracy and attained faster

concealed by the accumulation of gradients over multiple local iterations. In
this work, we propose a principled way to extend gradient inversion attacks to

method based on the characteristic of two-dimensional gradient flow and
low-rank property of local updates. Our method largely boosts the ability of
gradient inversion attacks on weight updates containing many iterations and

with skewed reproduction mechanims, we study a Moran model with selection. We
assume that there are two types of individuals, where the reproductive success
of one type is larger than the other. The higher reproductive success may stem
from either more frequent reproduction, or from larger numbers of offspring,
and is encoded in a measure $\Lambda$ for each of the two types. Our approach
consists of constructing a $\Lambda$-asymmetric Moran model in which
individuals of the two populations compete, rather than considering a Moran
model for each population. Under certain conditions, that we call the ``partial
order of adaptation'', we can couple these measures. This allows us to
construct the central object of this paper, the $\Lambda-$asymmetric ancestral
selection graph, leading to a pathwise duality of the forward in time
$\Lambda$-asymmetric Moran model with its ancestral process. Interestingly, the
construction also provides a connection to the theory of optimal transport. We
apply the ancestral selection graph in order to obtain scaling limits of the
forward and backward processes, and note that the frequency process converges
to the solution of an SDE with discontinous paths. Finally, we derive a
Griffiths representation for the generator of the SDE and use it to find a
semi-explicit formula for the probability of fixation of the less beneficial of
the two types.

Earth-like exoplanets orbiting M-stars as observed by current and future

to generate synthetic thermal infrared (TIR) observations. The range of
'observed' intensities provides a rough hint of the atmospheric temperature
range without any a priori knowledge. The equivalent brightness temperature
(related to intensities by Planck's function) at certain wavenumbers can be
used to estimate the atmospheric temperature at corresponding altitudes. To
exploit the full information provided by the measurement we generalize
Chahine's original approach and infer atmospheric temperatures from all
spectral data using the wavenumber-to-altitude mapping defined by the weighting
functions. Chahine relaxation allows an iterative refinement of this 'first
guess'. Analysis of the 4.3{\mu}m and 15{\mu}m carbon dioxide TIR bands enables
an estimate of atmospheric temperatures for rocky exoplanets even for low
signal to noise ratios of 10 and medium resolution. Inference of Trappist-1e
temperatures is, however, more challenging especially for CO2 dominated
atmospheres: the 'standard' 4.3{\mu}m and 15{\mu}m regions are optically thick
and an extension of the spectral range towards atmospheric window regions is
important. If atmospheric composition (essentially CO2 concentration) is known
temperatures can be estimated remarkably well, quality measures such as the
residual norm provide hints on incorrect abundances. In conclusion, temperature
in the mid atmosphere of Earth-like planets orbiting cooler stars can be
quickly estimated from thermal IR emission spectra with moderate resolution.

decarbonization is insufficient to keep pace with efforts to achieve this goal.
Rooftop PVs integrated with electric vehicles (EVs) as battery is a promising
technology capable to supply CO2-free, affordable, and dispatchable electricity
in urban environments (SolarEV City Concept). Here, we evaluated Paris, France
for the decarbonization potentials of rooftop PV + EV in comparison to the
surrounding suburban area Ile-de-France and Kyoto, Japan. We assessed various
scenarios by calculating the energy sufficiency, self-consumption,
self-sufficiency, cost savings, and CO2 emission reduction of the PV + EV
system or PV only system. The combination of EVs with PVs by V2H or V2B systems
at the city or region level was found to be more effective in Ile-de-France
than in Paris suggesting that SolarEV City is more effective for geographically
larger area including Paris. If implemented at a significant scale, they can
add substantial values to rooftop PV economics and keep a high self-consumption
and self-sufficiency, which also allows bypassing the classical battery storage
that is too expensive to be profitable. Furthermore, the systems potentially
allow rapid CO2 emissions reduction; however, with already low-carbon
electricity of France by nuclear power, CO2 abatement (0.020 kgCO2kWh-1
reduction from 0.063 kgCO2kWh-1) by PV + EV system can be limited, in
comparison to that (0.270 kgCO2kWh-1 reduction from 0.352 kgCO2kWh-1) of Kyoto,
also because of the Paris low insolation and high demands in higher latitude
winter. While the SolarEV City Concept can help Paris to move one step closer
to the carbon neutrality goal, there are also implementation challenges for
installing PVs in Paris.

computing (QC) and classical machine learning (ML) algorithms. However,
measurements in QC often disturb or destroy quantum states, requiring multiple
repetitions of data processing to estimate observable values. In particular,
this prevents online (i.e., real-time, single-shot) processing of temporal data
as measurements are commonly performed during intermediate stages. Recently, it
was proposed to sidestep this issue by focusing on tasks with quantum output,
thereby removing the need for detectors. Inspired by reservoir computers, a
model was proposed where only a subset of the internal parameters are optimized
while keeping the others fixed at random values. Here, we also process quantum
time series, but we do so using a quantum optical recurrent neural network
(QORNN) of which all internal interactions can be trained. As expected, this
approach yields higher performance, as long as training the QORNN is feasible.
We further show that our model can enhance the transmission rate of quantum
channels that experience certain memory effects. Moreover, it can counteract
similar memory effects if they are unwanted, a task that could previously only
be solved when redundantly encoded input signals were available. Finally, we
run a small-scale version of this last task on the photonic processor Borealis,
demonstrating that our QORNN can be constructed using currently existing

attention due to its wide applications. In this aspect, the dominant model
formalizes this task as a sequence-to-sequence generation task and serializes
each table into a token sequence during training by concatenating all rows in a
top-down order. However, it suffers from two serious defects: 1) the predefined
order introduces a wrong bias during training, which highly penalizes shifts in
the order between rows; 2) the error propagation problem becomes serious when
the model outputs a long token sequence. In this paper, we first conduct a
preliminary study to demonstrate the generation of most rows is
order-insensitive. Furthermore, we propose a novel sequence-to-sequence&set
text-to-table generation model. Specifically, in addition to a text encoder
encoding the input text, our model is equipped with a table header generator to
first output a table header, i.e., the first row of the table, in the manner of
sequence generation. Then we use a table body generator with learnable row
embeddings and column embeddings to generate a set of table body rows in
parallel. Particularly, to deal with the issue that there is no correspondence
between each generated table body row and target during training, we propose a
target assignment strategy based on the bipartite matching between the first
cells of generated table body rows and targets. Experiment results show that
our model significantly surpasses the baselines, achieving state-of-the-art

automated tools in cancer imaging. Unfortunately, many do not include

Artificial intelligence-based annotation tools have been shown to achieve
acceptable performance and thus can be used to automatically annotate large
datasets. As part of the effort to enrich public data available within NCI
Imaging Data Commons (IDC), here we introduce AI-generated annotations for two
collections of computed tomography images of the chest, NSCLC-Radiomics, and
the National Lung Screening Trial. Using publicly available AI algorithms we
derived volumetric annotations of thoracic organs at risk, their corresponding
radiomics features, and slice-level annotations of anatomical landmarks and
regions. The resulting annotations are publicly available within IDC, where the
DICOM format is used to harmonize the data and achieve FAIR principles. The
annotations are accompanied by cloud-enabled notebooks demonstrating their use.
This study reinforces the need for large, publicly accessible curated datasets
and demonstrates how AI can be used to aid in cancer imaging.

friction force that acts on a two-level atom that moves with relative velocity
v parallel to a planar metallic surface. We find that the friction force has a
component that is sensitive to the handedness of the atomic transition dipole
moment. In the particular, we show that the friction force due to a particular
atomic transition can be enhanced by a dipole moment with a certain handedness,
and almost suppressed by the dipole moment with the opposite handedness.
Curiously, the handedness of the transition dipole moment that boosts the
ground-state friction force is the opposite of what is classically expected
from the spin-momentum locking. We explain this discrepancy in terms of the

additional complications with respect to standard graphs as different layers
may be characterized by different structures and types of information. One of
the major challenges is to establish the extent to which each layer contributes
to the cluster assignment in order to effectively take advantage of the
multilayer structure and improve upon the classification obtained using the
individual layers or their union. However, making an informed a-priori
assessment about the clustering information content of the layers can be very
complicated. In this work, we assume a semi-supervised learning setting, where
the class of a small percentage of nodes is initially provided, and we propose
a parameter-free Laplacian-regularized model that learns an optimal nonlinear
combination of the different layers from the available input labels. The
learning algorithm is based on a Frank-Wolfe optimization scheme with inexact
gradient, combined with a modified Label Propagation iteration. We provide a
detailed convergence analysis of the algorithm and extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing that the proposed method compares
favourably with a variety of baselines and outperforms each individual layer

boundary; instead, the boundary is defined by a level set function and cuts
through the background mesh arbitrarily. The original unknown structure of HDG
and its hybrid nature ensuring the local conservation of fluxes is kept, while
developing a modified bilinear form for the elements cut by the boundary. At
every cut element, an auxiliary nodal trace variable on the boundary is
introduced, which is eliminated afterwards while imposing the boundary
conditions. Both stationary and time dependent CDEs are studied over a range of
flow regimes from diffusion to convection dominated; using high order $(p \leq

affects the estimated particle sizes from these two methods. Porous particles
have lower refractive indices, which affect both opacity and polarization
fraction. With weaker Mie interference patterns, the porous particles have
lower opacity at mm wavelengths than the compact particles if the particle size
exceeds several hundred microns. Consequently, the inferred dust mass using
porous particles can be up to a factor of six higher. The most significant
difference between compact and porous particles is their scattering properties.
The porous particles have a wider range of particle sizes with high linear
polarization from dust self-scattering, allowing mm-cm-sized particles to
explain polarization observations. With a Bayesian approach, we use porous
particles to fit HL Tau disk's multi-wavelength continuum and mm-polarization
observations from ALMA and VLA. The moderately porous particles with sizes from
1 mm-1 m can explain both continuum and polarization observations, especially
in the region between 20-60 au. If the particles in HL Tau are porous, the
porosity should be from 70% to 97% from current polarization observations. We
also predict that future observations of the self-scattering linear

TMDs through a simple one-drop solution technique. Our results, including
ab-initio simulations, show that the Bohr radius difference between the top
sulphur and the bottom selenium atoms within Janus M_Se^S (M=Mo, W) results in
a permanent compressive surface strain that acts as a nanoscroll formation
catalyst after small liquid interaction. Unlike classical 2D layers, the
surface strain in Janus TMDs can be engineered from compressive to tensile by
placing larger Bohr radius atoms on top (M_S^Se) to yield inverted C scrolls.

readily formed Moir\'e lattices. In contrast, spectroscopy and FETs studies
establish their excitonic and device properties and highlight significant

deconvolving with the HRT point spread function (PSF) and to correct for the
effects of optical aberrations on the data. We use a pair of focused--defocused

phase diversity (PD) analysis. The wavefront error of HRT depends on the
orbital distance of SO to the Sun. At distances $>0.5$\,au, the wavefront error
is small, and stems dominantly from the inherent optical properties of HRT. At

distance of SO to the Sun. We also introduce a new level of image
reconstruction, termed `aberration correction', which is designed to reduce the
noise caused by image deconvolution while removing the aberrations caused by
the HREW. The computed PSF via phase diversity significantly reduces the
degradation caused by the HREW in the near-perihelion HRT data. In addition,
the aberration correction increases the noise by a factor of only $1.45$

reconstructions.

We introduce a DR benchmark comprising diverse NLP tasks, including sentence
and token-level classification, QA, and generation, each task consists of
several domains. We propose two views of the DR challenge: Source Drop (SD) and
Target Drop (TD), which alternate between the source and target in-domain
performance as reference points. We find that in significant proportions of
domain shifts, either SD or TD is positive, but not both, emphasizing the
importance of considering both measures as diagnostic tools. Our experimental
results demonstrate the persistent existence of the DR challenge in both
fine-tuning and few-shot learning models, though it is less pronounced in the
latter. We also find that increasing the fine-tuned model size improves
performance, particularly in classification.

solutions with small generalization gap (the difference between the performance

generalization gap depends on what we call inconsistency and instability of
model outputs, which can be estimated on unlabeled data. Our empirical study
based on this analysis shows that instability and inconsistency are strongly
predictive of generalization gap in various settings. In particular, our
finding indicates that inconsistency is a more reliable indicator of
generalization gap than the sharpness of the loss landscape. Furthermore, we
show that algorithmic reduction of inconsistency leads to superior performance.

irreversible matching decisions at each step. While numerous expert online
algorithms have been proposed with bounded worst-case competitive ratios, they
may not offer satisfactory performance in average cases. On the other hand,
reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to improve the average
performance, but it lacks robustness and can perform arbitrarily poorly. In
this paper, we propose a novel RL-based approach to edge-weighted online
bipartite matching with robustness guarantees (LOMAR), achieving both good
average-case and worst-case performance. The key novelty of LOMAR is a new
online switching operation which, based on a judicious condition to hedge
against future uncertainties, decides whether to follow the expert's decision
or the RL decision for each online item. We prove that for any $\rho\in[0,1]$,
LOMAR is $\rho$-competitive against any given expert online algorithm. To
improve the average performance, we train the RL policy by explicitly
considering the online switching operation. Finally, we run empirical
experiments to demonstrate the advantages of LOMAR compared to existing

structure and consequently cannot be excited. This leads to a specific
prediction about the waveform of gravitational waves, which they emit during a
binary black hole inspiral and to the vanishing of their Love numbers. However,
if astrophysical black holes do possess an internal structure, their Love
numbers would no longer vanish, and they could be excited during an inspiral by
the transfer of orbital energy. This would affect the orbital period and lead
to an observable imprint on the emitted gravitational waves waveform. The
effect is enhanced if one of the binary companions is resonantly excited. We
discuss the conditions for resonant excitation of a hypothetical internal
structure of black holes and calculate the phase change of the gravitational
waves waveform that is induced due to such resonant excitation during
intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals. We then relate the phase change
to the electric quadrupolar Love number of the larger companion, which is
resonantly excited by its smaller companion. We discuss the statistical error
on measuring the Love number by LISA and show that, because of this phase
change, the statistical error is small even for small values of the Love
number. Our results provide a strong indication that the Love number could be
detected by LISA with remarkable accuracy, much higher than what can be
achieved via tidal deformation effects. Our results further indicate that
resonant excitation of the central black hole during an extreme- or
intermediate-mass-ratio inspirals is the most promising effect for putting
bounds on, or detecting, non-vanishing tidal Love numbers of black holes.

reconstructs camera poses and 3D neural scene representations online and in a

flow to 3D scene flow via differentiable rendering, preserving locality and
shift-equivariance of the image processing backbone. SE(3) camera pose
estimation is then performed via a weighted least-squares fit to the scene flow
field. This formulation enables us to jointly supervise pose estimation and a
generalizable neural scene representation via re-rendering the input video, and
thus, train end-to-end and fully self-supervised on real-world video datasets.
We demonstrate that our method performs robustly on diverse, real-world video,

of neurons in the layer that is larger than a threshold size shares a large
degree of similarity with the full layer and is able to perform similarly as
the whole layer on a variety of downstream tasks. For example, a linear probe
trained on $20\%$ of randomly picked neurons from a ResNet50 pre-trained on
ImageNet1k achieves an accuracy within $5\%$ of a linear probe trained on the
full layer of neurons for downstream CIFAR10 classification. We conduct
experiments on different neural architectures (including CNNs and Transformers)
pre-trained on both ImageNet1k and ImageNet21k and evaluate a variety of
downstream tasks taken from the VTAB benchmark. We find that the loss & dataset

the ""critical mass"" of neurons needed often depends on the downstream task,
suggesting that there is a task-inherent redundancy-performance Pareto

generative model, namely conditional generative adversarial networks, to
resemble the numerical simulations of the pore collapse process at
representative training shock pressures. Since the simulations are expensive,
the training data are scarce, which makes training an accurate surrogate model
challenging. To overcome the difficulties posed by the complex physics
phenomena, we make several crucial treatments to the plain original form of the
methods to increase the capability of approximating and predicting the

conditional inputs to guide the prediction. In realizing these methods, the
training of each dynamic mode composition model takes only around 30 seconds on
CPU. In contrast, training a generative adversarial network model takes 8 hours
on GPU. Moreover, using dynamic mode decomposition, the final-time relative
error is around 0.3% in the reproductive cases. We also demonstrate the
predictive power of the methods at unseen testing shock pressures, where the

does not support the notion of long-term changes in the X-ray flux and

within CTAT, an intelligent tutoring system, aiming to increase student
engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Through iterative prompt engineering,
we achieved meaningful contextualization that preserved the difficulty and
original intent of the problem, thereby not altering values or overcomplicating
the questions. While our research highlights the potential of LLMs in
educational settings, we acknowledge current limitations, particularly with
geometry problems, and emphasize the need for ongoing evaluation and research.
Future work includes systematic studies to measure the impact of this tool on
students' learning outcomes and enhancements to handle a broader range of
problems.

use parameterized function as push-forward map to characterize the solution of

Hamiltonian system in the phase space of the parameter manifold. We establish
error analysis results for the continuous time approximation scheme in
Wasserstein metric. For the numerical implementation, we use neural networks as
push-forward maps. We apply an effective symplectic scheme to solve the derived
Hamiltonian ODE system so that the method preserves some important quantities

integrator without any neural network training. Thus, our method does not
involve direct optimization over network parameters and hence can avoid the
error introduced by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, which is usually
hard to quantify and measure. The proposed algorithm is a sampling-based
approach that scales well to higher dimensional problems. In addition, the
method also provides an alternative connection between the Lagrangian and

divides the given circuit into sub-circuits such that each sub-circuit can be
executed using zero teleportations and the teleportation cost incurred at the

an invariant learning problem: the most effective predictor should be invariant
across multiple text environments. We then discuss a natural solution that

semi-supervised shape-understanding module to bypass the need for explicit

deforms individual surface points to match the target pose. Furthermore, to
encourage realistic and accurate deformation of stylized characters, we
introduce an efficient volume-based test-time training procedure. Because it

our model generalizes to categories with scarce annotation, such as stylized

concept directional sharpness. We argue that the performance of optimization

twisted graphene layer sliding on top of bulk graphite -- a demonstration case
that could easily be generalized to other systems. Neglecting quantum effects
and assuming a classical Langevin dynamics, we derive friction expressions
valid in two temperature regimes. At low temperatures the nonzero sliding
friction velocity derivative dF_k/dv_0 is shown by Adelman-Doll-Kantorovich

affected by an analytically derived effective damping parameter, replacing the
semi-infinite substrate. At high temperatures, friction grows proportional to
temperature as analytically required by fluctuation-dissipation. The theory is
validated by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with different

multiplier method in constrained optimization to handle the constraint by
creating a generalized Lagrangian with minimax decision primal variables and a

algorithm to solve this Lagrangian problem while balancing exploration and
exploitation. Our algorithm updates the minimax decision primal variables via
online mirror descent and the dual variable via projected gradient step and we
prove that it enjoys sublinear rate $ O((|X|+|Y|) L \sqrt{T(|A|+|B|)}))$ for
both regret and constraint violation after playing $T$ episodes of the game.
Here, $L$ is the horizon of each episode, $(|X|,|A|)$ and $(|Y|,|B|)$ are the

The uneven intensities and
distribution of flows between systems of cities results in hierarchically
organised complex networks of urban exchange. Distinct urban spatial structures
reflect the diversity of functional and social patterns which vary or remain
constant across multiple scales. In this work, we examine the impact of
commuting on the potential accessibility to spatial and social diversity, and
the scalar relations that may exist. We first define relational scales by
conducting a process of percolation on the commuting network, as a hierarchical
clustering algorithm. This gives rise to a nested structure of urban clusters
based on flow connectivity. For each cluster at each scale, we compute measures
of commuting structural and social diversity by examining the spatial
distribution of origin-destination pairs, and the distribution of workers'
skills and occupations. To do this, we make use of global entropy measures
allowing us to quantitatively analyse the reachable diversity across scales.
Applying this methodology to Chile, we observe that the hierarchical
accessibility to the wider system of cities and the patterns of spatial
interaction, significantly influence the degree of exposure to diversity within
urban systems. This framework examines connectivity-based diversity at multiple
scales, and allows for the classification of cities and systems of cities
according to the spatial and social dimensions of commuting dispersion. Such
insights could contribute to the planning of infrastructural projects
connecting the urban system at different scales, while also guiding a strategic
relocation and redistribution of economic activities at regional levels.

(HK) models -- have emerged as a promising tool to study the emergence of
superconductivity and topology in strongly correlated systems. Two obstacles,
however, have made it difficult to understand the applicability of these
models, especially to topological features: they have thermodynamically large
ground state degeneracies, and they tacitly assume spin conservation. We show
that neither are essential to HK models and that both can be avoided by
introducing interactions between tight-binding states in the orbital basis,
rather than between energy eigenstates. To solve these ""orbital"" models, we
introduce a general technique for solving HK models and show that previous
models appear as special cases. We illustrate our method by exactly solving
graphene and the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions. Both realize Mott
insulating phases with finite magnetic susceptibility; the graphene model has a
fourfold degenerate ground state while the Kane-Mele model has a nondegenerate
ground state in the presence of interactions. Our technique then allows us to
study the effect of strong interactions on symmetry-enforced degeneracy in
spin-orbit coupled double-Dirac semimetals. We show that adding HK interactions
to a double Dirac semi-metal leads to a Mott insulating, spin liquid phase. We
then use a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to express the low-energy
Hamiltonian in terms of the spin degrees of freedom, making the spin-charge
separation explicit. Finally, we enumerate a broader class of
symmetry-preserving HK interactions and show how they can violate insulating
filling constraints derived from space group symmetries. This suggests that new
approaches are needed to study topological order in the presence of long-range
interactions of the HK type.

As our initial analysis of BLIP-family models revealed difficulty with
answering fine-detail questions, we investigate the following question: Can
visual cropping be employed to improve the performance of state-of-the-art
visual question answering models on fine-detail questions? Given the recent
success of the BLIP-family models, we study a zero-shot and a fine-tuned BLIP
model. We define three controlled subsets of the popular VQA-v2 benchmark to
measure whether cropping can help model performance. Besides human cropping, we
devise two automatic cropping strategies based on multi-modal embedding by CLIP
and BLIP visual QA model gradients. Our experiments demonstrate that the
performance of BLIP model variants can be significantly improved through human
cropping, and automatic cropping methods can produce comparable benefits. A
deeper dive into our findings indicates that the performance enhancement is
more pronounced in zero-shot models than in fine-tuned models and more salient
with smaller bounding boxes than larger ones. We perform case studies to
connect quantitative differences with qualitative observations across question
types and datasets. Finally, we see that the cropping enhancement is robust, as
we gain an improvement of 4.59% (absolute) in the general VQA-random task by
simply inputting a concatenation of the original and gradient-based cropped

We conducted dynamic mode decomposition and analyze the Koopman modes in the

explain spontaneous symmetry breaking and multiple motility patterns through
stick-slip dynamics, without the need to account for signaling networks or

cell shape and mechanics during crawling. Through a local force balance along a
deformable boundary, we show that the membrane tension coupled with shape

mechanosensitive adhesions. Linear stability analysis identified the unstable
parameter regimes where spontaneous symmetry breaking can take place. sing
simulations to solve the fully coupled nonlinear system of equations, we show
that starting from a randomly perturbed circular shape, this instability can
lead to keratocyte-like shapes. Simulations predict that different adhesion
kinetics and membrane tension can result in different cell motility modes

using a minimal model of cell motility, we identify that the interplay between

network science and dynamical systems. Particular attention has been paid to
the emergence of chimera states, where subsets of synchronized oscillations
coexist with asynchronous ones. Such coexistence of coherence and incoherence
is a perfect example where order and disorder can persist in a long-lasting

several diverse dynamical phenomena, e.g., amplitude chimeras or oscillon

understand the qualia discrimination mechanism, we need to ask how the brain
autonomously develops such a mathematical structure using the constructive

qualia types. We formulate the algebraic independence to link it to the
other-qualia-type invariant transformation, a familiar formulation of the

explains downward causation, i.e. the macro-level relationship has the causal
power over its components, because algebra is the macro-level relationship that
is irreducible to a law of neurons, and a self-evaluation of algebra is used to
control neurons. The downward causation is required to explain a causal role of

we survey the developers in the network to evaluate if code coming from a

BetaZero learns offline approximations based on accurate belief models to

challenges inherent in large-scale partially observable domains; namely
challenges of transitioning in stochastic environments, prioritizing action
branching with limited search budget, and representing beliefs as input to the

changes from decreasing to increasing when scattering parameter approaches
$P\approx0.91\,P_{{\rm crit}}$, where $P_{{\rm crit}}\approx0.2807$ at which

that presence of nodes causes the slope $\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}},$ to
decrease initially with increasing $P$, whereas in the nodeless state,
$\partial_{T}H_{c2}|_{T_{c}}$ monotonically increases. Therefore, fairly

the slope of $H_{c2}$ at $T_{c}$.

in a learning task in a target domain in combination with data available at the

representation (DIRep) learned by a generator from all input samples and then
train a classifier on top of it using all labeled samples. A domain
discriminator is added to train the generator adversarially to exclude domain
specific features from the DIRep. However, this approach tends to generate
insufficient information for accurate classification learning. In this paper,
we present a novel approach that integrates the adversarial model with a
variational autoencoder. In addition to the DIRep, we introduce a
domain-dependent representation (DDRep) such that information from both DIRep
and DDRep is sufficient to reconstruct samples from both domains. We further
penalize the size of the DDRep to drive as much information as possible to the
DIRep, which maximizes the accuracy of the classifier in labeling samples in
both domains. We empirically evaluate our model using synthetic datasets and
demonstrate that spurious class-related features introduced in the source
domain are successfully absorbed by the DDRep. This leaves a rich and clean
DIRep for accurate transfer learning in the target domain. We further
demonstrate its superior performance against other algorithms for a number of
common image datasets. We also show we can take advantage of pretrained models.

processing time distribution of tasks depends on both the task and server
types. Our study focuses on the asymptotic regime, where the number of servers
and task types tend to infinity in proportion. In heterogeneous environments,
commonly used load balancing policies such as Join Fastest Idle Queue and Join
Fastest Shortest Queue exhibit poor performance and even shrink the stability
region. Interestingly, prior to this work, finding a scalable policy with a
provable performance guarantee in this setup remained an open question.
  To address this gap, we propose and analyze two asymptotically delay-optimal
dynamic load balancing policies. The first policy efficiently reserves the
processing capacity of each server for ``good"" tasks and routes tasks using the
vanilla Join Idle Queue policy. The second policy, called the speed-priority
policy, significantly increases the likelihood of assigning tasks to the
respective ``good"" servers capable of processing them at high speeds. By
leveraging a framework inspired by the graphon literature and employing the
mean-field method and stochastic coupling arguments, we demonstrate that both
policies achieve asymptotic zero queuing. Specifically, as the system scales,
the probability of a typical task being assigned to an idle server approaches

significant areas of focus in orbital edge computing, which include protocol
optimization, mobility management, and resource allocation. This article

A logarithmic increase with time is observed for the relative abundance of

The communication channel has limited bandwidth and hence the transmitted
signals over the network are subject to quantization. To deal with agent's
output, an observer is implemented at each node. The state of the observer is
quantized by a finite-level quantizer and then transmitted over the network. To
solve the problem of quantizer overflow under malicious packet losses, a
zooming-in and out dynamic quantization mechanism is designed. By the new
quantized controller proposed in the paper, the zooming-out factor is lower
bounded by the spectral radius of the agent's dynamic matrix. A sufficient
condition of quantization range is provided under which the finite-level
quantizer is free of overflow. A sufficient condition of tolerable DoS attacks
for achieving consensus is also provided. At last, we study scalar dynamical
agents as a special case and further tighten the zooming-out factor to a value
smaller than the agent's dynamic parameter. Under such a zooming-out factor, it
is possible to recover the level of tolerable DoS attacks to that of

resource; in each round, the PS aggregates the updates from a subset of clients
only. In this paper, we focus on non-convex minimization that is vulnerable to
non-uniform and time-varying communication failures between the PS and the
clients. Specifically, in each round $t$, the link between the PS and client
$i$ is active with probability $p_i^t$, which is $\textit{unknown}$ to both the
PS and the clients. This arises when the channel conditions are heterogeneous
across clients and are changing over time.
  We show that when the $p_i^t$'s are not uniform, $\textit{Federated Average}$
(FedAvg) -- the most widely adopted FL algorithm -- fails to minimize the
global objective. Observing this, we propose $\textit{Federated Postponed
Broadcast}$ (FedPBC) which is a simple variant of FedAvg. It differs from
FedAvg in that the PS postpones broadcasting the global model till the end of
each round. We show that FedPBC converges to a stationary point of the original
objective. The introduced staleness is mild and there is no noticeable
slowdown. Both theoretical analysis and numerical results are provided. On the
technical front, postponing the global model broadcasts enables implicit
gossiping among the clients with active links at round $t$. Despite $p_i^t$'s

is always one of the most interested problems in the study of the resonance
phenomena in coupled nonlinear dynamical systems. With an optomechanical system
operating in the regime of unresolved sideband, where its mechanical frequency
is lower than the cavity field damping rate, we illustrate the existence of a
special nonlinear resonance phenomenon. This type of previously unknown
resonance manifests an organized pattern of the coupled cavity field and
mechanical oscillation, so that the cavity field precisely pushes the
mechanical oscillator within an appropriate small time window in each
mechanical oscillation period and the mechanical energy will increase by a jump
of almost fixed amount after each oscillation cycle. The scenario is realized
at a resonance point where the frequency difference of two driving fields
matches the mechanical frequency of the system, and this condition of
drive-frequency match is found to trigger a mechanism to lock the two
subsystems of an unresolved-sideband optomechanical system into a highly
ordered energy transfer as the above mentioned. Due to a significantly enhanced
nonlinearity in the vicinity of the resonance point, optical frequency combs
can be generated under pump powers of thousand times lower, as compared to the
use of a single-tone driving field for the purpose. An unresolved sideband
system under the drives without satisfying the resonance condition also
demonstrates other interesting dynamical behaviors. Most of all, by providing a
realistic picture for the nonlinear optomechanical dynamics in unresolved
sideband regime, our study points to a direction to observe novel dynamical
phenomena and realize other applications with the systems of less technical

often data- and computationally-inefficient, as they require a large number of
MPC demonstrations, resulting in long training times, and they produce policies
with limited robustness to disturbances not experienced during training. In
this work, we propose an IL strategy to efficiently compress a computationally
expensive MPC into a Deep Neural Network (DNN) policy that is robust to
previously unseen disturbances. By using a robust variant of the MPC, called
Robust Tube MPC (RTMPC), and leveraging properties from the controller, we
introduce a computationally-efficient Data Aggregation (DA) method that enables
a significant reduction of the number of MPC demonstrations and training time
required to generate a robust policy. Our approach opens the possibility of
zero-shot transfer of a policy trained from a single MPC demonstration
collected in a nominal domain, such as a simulation or a robot in a

using linear and nonlinear MPC for agile flight on a multirotor show that our
method outperforms strategies commonly employed in IL (such as DAgger and DR)

and the three shorter periods as the radial first, second, and third overtones.
From a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis including the pulsation/convection

the envelope of a model in a late stage of the core-carbon burning. Models with
similar pulsation property have masses around 11M_\odot (19M_\odot at ZAMS)
with luminosities (log L/L_\odot =5.27~5.28) and effective temperatures (log
T_{eff}\approx 3.53) that are consistent with the range of the observational
determinations. We also find that a synthetic light curve obtained by adding

estimated for sources crossmatched between the Swift-BAT and Fermi-LAT catalogs
by interpolating the energy spectra in the hard X-ray and GeV gamma-ray ranges,

reconcile the cosmic-ray and gamma-ray spectra with observations by AMS-02,

by a combination of the sources and the Galactic diffuse emission. Furthermore,
combined with the extragalactic emission, we construct all-sky images in the

significant sustainability challenges due to their high GHG emissions, e.g.:
blockchain; metaverse applications; and data centers. The second dimension
consists in efforts to render AI regulation, and by implication the law itself,
more sustainable. Certain rights we have come to take for granted, such as the
right to erasure (Article 17 GDPR), may have to be limited due to
sustainability considerations. For example, the subjective right to erasure, in
some situations, has to be balanced against the collective interest in
mitigating climate change. The paper formulates guidelines to strike this
balance equitably, discusses specific use cases, and identifies doctrinal legal
methods for incorporating such a ""sustainability limitation"" into existing

computer science and sustainability studies need to team up to effectively
address the dual large-scale transformations of digitization and

  Insights from Molecular Simulations",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Electrostatic interactions in polymeric systems are responsible for a wide
range of liquid-liquid phase transitions that are of importance for biology and
materials science. Such transitions are referred to as complex coacervation,
and recent studies have sought to understand the underlying physics and
chemistry. Most theoretical and simulation efforts to date have focused on
oppositely charged linear polyelectrolytes, which adopt nearly ideal-coil
conformations in the condensed phase. However, when one of the coacervate
components is a globular protein, a better model of complexation should replace
one of the species with a spherical charged particle or colloid. In this work,
we perform coarse-grained simulations of colloid-polyelectrolyte coacervation
using a spherical model for the colloid. Simulation results indicate that the
electroneutral cell of the resulting (hybrid) coacervates consists of a
polyelectrolyte layer adsorbed on the colloid. Power laws for the structure and
the density of the condensed phase, which are extracted from simulations, are
found to be consistent with the adsorption-based scaling theory of
coacervation. The coacervates remain amorphous (disordered) at a moderate
colloid charge, $Q$, while an intra-coacervate colloidal crystal is formed
above a certain threshold, at $Q > Q^{*}$. In the disordered coacervate, if $Q$
is sufficiently low, colloids diffuse as neutral non-sticky nanoparticles in
the semidilute polymer solution. For higher $Q$, adsorption is strong and
colloids become effectively sticky. Our findings are relevant for the
coacervation of polyelectrolytes with proteins, spherical micelles of ionic
surfactants, and solid organic or inorganic nanoparticles.

$\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}$-divergence but is easier to evaluate and
substantially tighter, consistently providing non-vacuous guarantees.
Estimating the bound requires optimizing one multiclass classifier to disagree

devise a ""disagreement loss"" which is theoretically justified and performs

understanding makes us develop a hypothesis that most classical machine
learning models, such as Random Forest (RF), are immune to adversarial attack
models because they do not rely on neural network design at all. Our
experimental study of classical machine learning models against popular
adversarial attacks supports this hypothesis. Based on this hypothesis, we
propose a new adversarial-aware deep learning system by using a classical
machine learning model as the secondary verification system to complement the
primary deep learning model in image classification. Although the secondary
classical machine learning model has less accurate output, it is only used for
verification purposes, which does not impact the output accuracy of the primary
deep learning model, and at the same time, can effectively detect an
adversarial attack when a clear mismatch occurs. Our experiments based on
CIFAR-100 dataset show that our proposed approach outperforms current
state-of-the-art adversarial defense systems.

capture the degree to which different treatments motivate different users, such
as coupons or discounts, also known as the estimation of individual treatment
effect (ITE). In an actual business scenario, the options for treatment may be
numerous and complex, and there may be correlations between different
treatments. In addition, each marketing instance may also have rich user and
contextual features. However, existing methods still fall short in both fully
exploiting treatment information and mining features that are sensitive to a
particular treatment. In this paper, we propose an explicit feature
interaction-aware uplift network (EFIN) to address these two problems. Our EFIN
includes four customized modules: 1) a feature encoding module encodes not only
the user and contextual features, but also the treatment features; 2) a
self-interaction module aims to accurately model the user's natural response
with all but the treatment features; 3) a treatment-aware interaction module
accurately models the degree to which a particular treatment motivates a user
through interactions between the treatment features and other features, i.e.,
ITE; and 4) an intervention constraint module is used to balance the ITE
distribution of users between the control and treatment groups so that the
model would still achieve a accurate uplift ranking on data collected from a
non-random intervention marketing scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on
two public datasets and one product dataset to verify the effectiveness of our
EFIN. In addition, our EFIN has been deployed in a credit card bill payment
scenario of a large online financial platform with a significant improvement.

  Networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.04352",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-adaptation solutions need to periodically monitor, reason about, and
adapt a running system. The adaptation step involves generating an adaptation
strategy and applying it to the running system whenever an anomaly arises. In
this article, we argue that, rather than generating individual adaptation
strategies, the goal should be to adapt the control logic of the running system
in such a way that the system itself would learn how to steer clear of future
anomalies, without triggering self-adaptation too frequently. While the need
for adaptation is never eliminated, especially noting the uncertain and
evolving environment of complex systems, reducing the frequency of adaptation
interventions is advantageous for various reasons, e.g., to increase
performance and to make a running system more robust. We instantiate and
empirically examine the above idea for software-defined networking -- a key
enabling technology for modern data centres and Internet of Things
applications. Using genetic programming,(GP), we propose a self-adaptation
solution that continuously learns and updates the control constructs in the
data-forwarding logic of a software-defined network. Our evaluation, performed
using open-source synthetic and industrial data, indicates that, compared to a
baseline adaptation technique that attempts to generate individual adaptations,
our GP-based approach is more effective in resolving network congestion, and
further, reduces the frequency of adaptation interventions over time. In
addition, we show that, for networks with the same topology, reusing over
larger networks the knowledge that is learned on smaller networks leads to
significant improvements in the performance of our GP-based adaptation
approach. Finally, we compare our approach against a standard data-forwarding
algorithm from the network literature, demonstrating that our approach
significantly reduces packet loss.

  Post-Training Quantization","Accepted to ICML 2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Post-training quantization (PTQ) has been gaining popularity for the
deployment of deep neural networks on resource-limited devices since unlike
quantization-aware training, neither a full training dataset nor end-to-end
training is required at all. As PTQ schemes based on reconstructing each layer
or block output turn out to be effective to enhance quantized model
performance, recent works have developed algorithms to devise and learn a new
weight-rounding scheme so as to better reconstruct each layer or block output.
In this work, we propose a simple yet effective new weight-rounding mechanism
for PTQ, coined FlexRound, based on element-wise division instead of typical
element-wise addition such that FlexRound enables jointly learning a common
quantization grid size as well as a different scale for each pre-trained
weight. Thanks to the reciprocal rule of derivatives induced by element-wise
division, FlexRound is inherently able to exploit pre-trained weights when
updating their corresponding scales, and thus, flexibly quantize pre-trained
weights depending on their magnitudes. We empirically validate the efficacy of
FlexRound on a wide range of models and tasks. To the best of our knowledge,
our work is the first to carry out comprehensive experiments on not only image
classification and natural language understanding but also natural language
generation, assuming a per-tensor uniform PTQ setting. Moreover, we
demonstrate, for the first time, that large language models can be efficiently
quantized, with only a negligible impact on performance compared to
half-precision baselines, achieved by reconstructing the output in a
block-by-block manner.

for such cognitive deficiencies is that they lack the benefits of thinking in

where the idea is to not just clone the behaviors of human demonstrators, but
also the thoughts humans have as they perform these behaviors. While we expect
Thought Cloning to truly shine at scale on internet-sized datasets of humans
thinking out loud while acting (e.g. online videos with transcripts), here we
conduct experiments in a domain where the thinking and action data are
synthetically generated. Results reveal that Thought Cloning learns much faster
than Behavioral Cloning and its performance advantage grows the further out of
distribution test tasks are, highlighting its ability to better handle novel
situations. Thought Cloning also provides important benefits for AI Safety and
Interpretability, and makes it easier to debug and improve AI. Because we can
observe the agent's thoughts, we can (1) more easily diagnose why things are
going wrong, making it easier to fix the problem, (2) steer the agent by
correcting its thinking, or (3) prevent it from doing unsafe things it plans to
do. Overall, by training agents how to think as well as behave, Thought Cloning
creates safer, more powerful agents.

communication networks, financial markets, etc.). Many multi-agent dynamical
interactions can be cast as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). While existing
research has focused on studying fairness in known environments, the
exploration of fairness in such systems for unknown environments remains open.
In this paper, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to achieve
fairness in multi-agent finite-horizon episodic MDPs. Instead of maximizing the
sum of individual agents' value functions, we introduce a fairness function
that ensures equitable rewards across agents. Since the classical Bellman's
equation does not hold when the sum of individual value functions is not
maximized, we cannot use traditional approaches. Instead, in order to explore,
we maintain a confidence bound of the unknown environment and then propose an
online convex optimization based approach to obtain a policy constrained to
this confidence region. We show that such an approach achieves sub-linear
regret in terms of the number of episodes. Additionally, we provide a probably
approximately correct (PAC) guarantee based on the obtained regret bound. We
also propose an offline RL algorithm and bound the optimality gap with respect
to the optimal fair solution. To mitigate computational complexity, we
introduce a policy-gradient type method for the fair objective. Simulation
experiments also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

consistent once all evidence variables are added to the SLCTF. In our approach,
the belief propagation step is non-iterative and the accuracy-complexity
trade-off is controlled using user-defined clique size bounds. Results for

nucleon near the $N^{*}(1535)$ and $N^{*}(1650)$ resonance positions have
revealed that the lattice QCD states have magnetic moments consistent with
predictions from a constituent-quark-model. Using Hamiltonian Effective Field
Theory (HEFT) to describe pion-nucleon scattering in the $I(J^{P}) =
\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}^{-})$ channel, we represent these two quark-model like
states as two single-particle bare basis states, dressed and mixed by
meson-baryon scattering channels. By constraining the free parameters of the
Hamiltonian with $S_{11}$ pion-nucleon scattering data, we perform the first
calculation of the finite-volume spectrum using two bare-baryon basis states.
By comparing this spectrum to contemporary lattice QCD results at three lattice
volumes, we analyse the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian to gain insight into
the structure and composition of these two low-lying resonances. We find that
an interpretation of the two low-lying nucleon resonances as quark-model like
states dressed by meson-baryon interactions is consistent with both the
$S_{11}$ scattering data and lattice QCD. We introduce a novel HEFT formalism
for estimating scattering-state contaminations in lattice QCD correlation
functions constructed with standard three-quark operators. Not only are
historical lattice QCD results described with excellent accuracy, but
correlation functions with large scattering-state contaminations are
identified.

algorithm for the problem and show that, under a natural monotonicity

atmospheric science and finance, the problems of denoising large data matrices
to recover signals obscured by noise, and of estimating the structure of these
signals, is of fundamental importance. A theoretical keystone to solving these
problems is understanding how the singular value structure of a signal is
deformed in the presence of noise. This question has been thoroughly studied in
the well-known spiked matrix model, in which data matrices originate from
low-rank signals perturbed by additive noise, in an asymptotic limit where the
size of these matrices tends to infinity but the signal rank remains finite. We
first show, strikingly, that the singular value structure of large finite
matrices (of size $O(1000)$) with even moderate-rank signals, as low as $10$,
is not accurately predicted by the finite-rank theory, thereby limiting the
application of this theory real data. To address these deficiencies, we
analytically compute how the singular values and vectors of an arbitrary signal
matrix are deformed by additive noise. We apply these analytical results to
study a different asymptotic limit corresponding to an $\textit{extensive}$
spike model, in which the rank of the hidden signal is proportional to the size
of the data matrix, while both tend to infinity. We map out the phase diagram
of the singular value structure of the extensive spike model as a joint
function of signal strength and rank. We further exploit these analytics to
derive optimal rotationally invariant denoisers to recover the hidden high-rank
signal from the data, as well as optimal invariant estimators of the signal
covariance structure. Overall, our results provide fundamental theory governing
how high-dimensional signals are deformed by additive noise, together with
practical formulas for optimal denoising and covariance estimation.

these tasks but also acts as an accelerative pre-conditioning that further
enhances this bias towards low-rankedness. Inspired by this, we propose an
explicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with
certain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam). This combination can enable a
degenerate single-layer network to achieve low-rank approximations with
generalization error comparable to deep linear networks, making depth no longer

study, we introduce CALICO, a novel framework that applies contrastive
objectives to both LiDAR and camera backbones. Specifically, CALICO
incorporates two stages: point-region contrast (PRC) and region-aware
distillation (RAD). PRC better balances the region- and scene-level

performance improvement compared to existing methods. RAD effectively achieves
contrastive distillation on our self-trained teacher model. CALICO's efficacy

domains. It trains a model on denoising tasks that encompass different noise
levels simultaneously, representing a form of multi-task learning (MTL).
However, analyzing and improving diffusion models from an MTL perspective
remains under-explored. In particular, MTL can sometimes lead to the well-known
phenomenon of $\textit{negative transfer}$, which results in the performance
degradation of certain tasks due to conflicts between tasks. In this paper, we
aim to analyze diffusion training from an MTL standpoint, presenting two key
observations: $\textbf{(O1)}$ the task affinity between denoising tasks
diminishes as the gap between noise levels widens, and $\textbf{(O2)}$ negative
transfer can arise even in the context of diffusion training. Building upon
these observations, our objective is to enhance diffusion training by
mitigating negative transfer. To achieve this, we propose leveraging existing
MTL methods, but the presence of a huge number of denoising tasks makes this
computationally expensive to calculate the necessary per-task loss or gradient.
To address this challenge, we propose clustering the denoising tasks into small
task clusters and applying MTL methods to them. Specifically, based on
$\textbf{(O2)}$, we employ interval clustering to enforce temporal proximity
among denoising tasks within clusters. We show that interval clustering can be
solved with dynamic programming and utilize signal-to-noise ratio, timestep,
and task affinity for clustering objectives. Through this, our approach
addresses the issue of negative transfer in diffusion models by allowing for
efficient computation of MTL methods. We validate the proposed clustering and
its integration with MTL methods through various experiments, demonstrating
improved sample quality of diffusion models.

Deriving an efficient query plan is challenging, and both academia and industry

are prone to performance issues, where a DBMS produces an inefficient query
plan that might lead to the slow execution of a query. Finding such issues is a
longstanding problem and inherently difficult, because no ground truth
information on an expected execution time exists. In this work, we propose
Cardinality Estimation Restriction Testing (CERT), a novel technique that
detects performance issues through the lens of cardinality estimation. Given a
query on a database, CERT derives a more restrictive query (e.g., by replacing
a LEFT JOIN with an INNER JOIN), whose estimated number of rows should not
exceed the number of estimated rows for the original query. CERT tests
cardinality estimators specifically, because they were shown to be the most
important component for query optimization; thus, we expect that finding and
fixing such issues might result in the highest performance gains. In addition,
we found that some other kinds of query optimization issues are exposed by the
unexpected cardinality estimation, which can also be detected by CERT. CERT is
a black-box technique that does not require access to the source code; DBMSs
expose query plans via the EXPLAIN statement. CERT eschews executing queries,
which is costly and prone to performance fluctuations. We evaluated CERT on
three widely used and mature DBMSs, MySQL, TiDB, and CockroachDB. CERT found 13
unique issues, of which 2 issues were fixed and 9 confirmed by the developers.
We expect that this new angle on finding performance bugs will help DBMS

i.e., they are symmetries of not single but multiple different types and the
degree of approximation varies across these types. Instead of proposing a new
architectural restriction as in most of the previous approaches, we present a
regularizer-based method for building a model for a dataset with mixed
approximate symmetries. The key component of our method is what we call
equivariance regularizer for a given type of symmetries, which measures how
much a model is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the type. Our
method is trained with these regularizers, one per each symmetry type, and the
strength of the regularizers is automatically tuned during training, leading to
the discovery of the approximation levels of some candidate symmetry types
without explicit supervision. Using synthetic function approximation and motion
forecasting tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than
prior approaches while discovering the approximate symmetry levels correctly.

transitivity of the group of symmetries of the cone of unnormalized states on
its interior (homogeneity), identification of this cone with its dual cone of
effects via an inner product (self-duality), and transitivity of the group of
symmetries of the normalized state space on the pure normalized states (pure
transitivity). Koecher and Vinberg showed that homogeneity and self-duality
characterize Jordan-algebraic state spaces: real, complex and quaternionic
quantum theory, spin factors, 3-dimensional octonionic quantum state space and
direct sums of these irreducible spaces. We show that self-duality follows from
homogeneity and pure transitivity. These properties have a more direct physical
and information-processing significance than self-duality. We show for instance
(extending results of Barnum, Gaebeler, and Wilce) that homogeneity is closely
related to the ability to steer quantum states. Our alternative to the
Koecher-Vinberg theorem characterizes nearly the same set of state spaces:
direct sums of isomorphic Jordan-algebraic ones, which may be viewed as
composites of a classical system with an irreducible Jordan-algebraic one.
There are various physically and informationally natural additional postulates
that are known to single out complex quantum theory from among these
Jordan-algebraic possibilities. We give various such reconstructions based on
the additional property of local tomography.

the lower level. The strategic behavior of DRPs is modeled in a game-theoretic

its equilibrium pseudofield, manifesting itself in the magnon Hanle effect.
Here, we investigate the impact of growth-induced changes in the magnetic
anisotropy on this effect in the antiferromagnetic insulator
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ (hematite). To this end, we compare the structural,
magnetic, and magnon-based spin transport properties of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$
films with different thicknesses grown by pulsed laser deposition in molecular
and atomic oxygen atmospheres. While in films grown with molecular oxygen a
spin-reorientation transition (Morin transition) is absent down to $10\,$K, we
observe a Morin transition for those grown by atomic-oxygen-assisted
deposition, indicating a change in magnetic anisotropy. Interestingly, even for
a $19\,$nm thin $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ film grown with atomic oxygen we still
detect a Morin transition at $125\,$K. We characterize the magnon Hanle effect
in these $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ films via all-electrical magnon transport
measurements. The films grown with atomic oxygen show a markedly different
magnon spin signal from those grown in molecular oxygen atmospheres. Most
importantly, the maximum magnon Hanle signal is significantly enhanced and the
Hanle peak is shifted to lower magnetic field values for films grown with
atomic oxygen. These observations suggest a change of magnetic anisotropy for
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ films fabricated by atomic-oxygen-assisted deposition
resulting in an increased oxygen content in these films. Our findings provide
new insights into the possibility to fine-tune the magnetic anisotropy in
$\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ and thereby to engineer the magnon Hanle effect.

making them practical for real-world applications. With this framework, we are
able to train a single model for 1000s of (product-type, attribute) pairs, thus
reducing the overhead of training and maintaining separate models. Extensive

enhances a low-resolution (LR) depth map guided by an extra high-resolution

to upscale the depth maps before feeding them into the network and transfer the
high-frequency information extracted from HR RGB images to guide the
reconstruction of depth maps. However, the extracted high-frequency information
usually contains textures that are not present in depth maps in the existence
of the cross-modality gap, and the noises would be further aggravated by
interpolation due to the resolution gap between the RGB and depth images. To
tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Symmetric Uncertainty-aware Feature
Transmission (SUFT) for color-guided DSR. (1) For the resolution gap, SUFT
builds an iterative up-and-down sampling pipeline, which makes depth features

MOPED compression reduces the bias in the covariance matrix and speeds up the

which must be integrated out when evaluating the likelihood function. Here, we
propose a sequential variational Bayes algorithm, called Recursive Variational
Gaussian Approximation for Latent variable models (R-VGAL), for estimating
parameters in GLMMs. The R-VGAL algorithm operates on the data sequentially,
requires only a single pass through the data, and can provide parameter updates
as new data are collected without the need of re-processing the previous data.
At each update, the R-VGAL algorithm requires the gradient and Hessian of a
""partial"" log-likelihood function evaluated at the new observation, which are
generally not available in closed form for GLMMs. To circumvent this issue, we
propose using an importance-sampling-based approach for estimating the gradient
and Hessian via Fisher's and Louis' identities. We find that R-VGAL can be
unstable when traversing the first few data points, but that this issue can be
mitigated by using a variant of variational tempering in the initial steps of
the algorithm. Through illustrations on both simulated and real datasets, we
show that R-VGAL provides good approximations to the exact posterior
distributions, that it can be made robust through tempering, and that it is

Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common

the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We
test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it

videos are constantly being generated, creating an urgent need for robust
incremental learning techniques for video understanding. One of the biggest
challenges in this task is catastrophic forgetting, where the network tends to
forget previously learned data while learning new categories. To overcome this
issue, knowledge distillation is a widely used technique for rehearsal-based
video incremental learning that involves transferring important information on
similarities among different categories to enhance the student model.
Therefore, it is preferable to have a strong teacher model to guide the
students. However, the limited performance of the network itself and the
occurrence of catastrophic forgetting can result in the teacher network making
inaccurate predictions for some memory exemplars, ultimately limiting the
student network's performance. Based on these observations, we propose a
teacher agent capable of generating stable and accurate soft labels to replace
the output of the teacher model. This method circumvents the problem of
knowledge misleading caused by inaccurate predictions of the teacher model and
avoids the computational overhead of loading the teacher model for knowledge
distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our method,
yielding significant performance improvements while utilizing only half the
resolution of video clips in the incremental phases as input compared to recent

structure of nondegenerate vector solitons and their collision dynamics. For
this purpose, we consider the generalized coupled nonlinear Schr\""odinger
(GCNLS) system which describes the evolution and nonlinear interaction of the
two optical modes. The fundamental as well as higher-order nondegenerate vector
soliton solutions are derived through the Hirota bilinear method and their
forms are rewritten in a compact way using Gram determinants. Very
interestingly, we find that the presence of four-wave mixing effect induces a
breathing vector soliton state in both the optical modes. Such breather
formation is not possible in the fundamental vector bright solitons of the
Manakov system. Then, for both strong and weak four-wave mixing effects, we
show that the nondegenerate solitons in the GCNLS system undergo, in general,
novel shape changing collisions, in addition to shape preserving collision
under suitable choice of wave numbers. Further, we analyze the degenerate
soliton collision induced novel shape changing property of nondegenerate vector
soliton by deriving the partially nondegenerate two-soliton solution. For
completeness, the various collision scenarios related to the pure degenerate
bright solitons are indicated. We believe that the results reported in this
paper will be useful in nonlinear optics for manipulating light by light

performance by simultaneously modeling images' local and global contexts.
However, the bidirectional interaction between these two contexts has not been
well explored and exploited, which is important in the human visual system.
This paper proposes a Fully Adaptive Self-Attention (FASA) mechanism for vision
transformer to model the local and global information as well as the
bidirectional interaction between them in context-aware ways. Specifically,
FASA employs self-modulated convolutions to adaptively extract local
representation while utilizing self-attention in down-sampled space to extract
global representation. Subsequently, it conducts a bidirectional adaptation
process between local and global representation to model their interaction. In
addition, we introduce a fine-grained downsampling strategy to enhance the
down-sampled self-attention mechanism for finer-grained global perception
capability. Based on FASA, we develop a family of lightweight vision backbones,
Fully Adaptive Transformer (FAT) family. Extensive experiments on multiple
vision tasks demonstrate that FAT achieves impressive performance. Notably, FAT
accomplishes a 77.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K using only 4.5M parameters and
0.7G FLOPs, which surpasses the most advanced ConvNets and Transformers with
similar model size and computational costs. Moreover, our model exhibits faster

multimedia research. In terms of vision-language (VL) tasks, they often serve
as a language encoder and still require an additional fusion network for VL
reasoning, resulting in excessive memory overhead. In this paper, we focus on
exploring PLMs as a stand-alone model for VL reasoning tasks. Inspired by the
recently popular prompt tuning, we first prove that the processed visual
features can be also projected onto the semantic space of PLMs and act as
prompt tokens to bridge the gap between single- and multi-modal learning.
However, this solution exhibits obvious redundancy in visual information and
model inference, and the placement of prompt tokens also greatly affects the
final performance. Based on these observations, we further propose a novel
transfer learning approach for PLMs, termed Dynamic Visual Prompting (DVP).
Concretely, DVP first deploys a cross-attention module to obtain text-related
and compact visual prompt tokens, thereby greatly reducing the input length of
PLMs. To obtain the optimal placement, we also equip DVP with a
reinforcement-learning based search algorithm, which can automatically merge
DVP with PLMs for different VL tasks via a very short search process. In
addition, we also experiment DVP with the recently popular adapter approach to
keep the most parameters of PLMs intact when adapting to VL tasks, helping PLMs
achieve a quick shift between single- and multi-modal tasks. We apply DVP to
two representative PLMs, namely BERT and T5, and conduct extensive experiments
on a set of VL reasoning benchmarks including VQA2.0, GQA and SNLIVE. The
experimental results not only show the advantage of DVP on efficiency and
performance, but also confirm its superiority in adapting pre-trained language

extinction ($A_{\rm V}$). However, no significant CO emission lines were
detected in any of the targets. The upper limits of the CO J=1-0 luminosities
are lower than expected given the molecular gas mass inferred from the nebular

feedback control in nuclear fusion tokamaks, where the primary actuators,

density feedback control approaches have only approximated pellet injection as
a continuous input due to the complexity that it introduces. In this letter, we
model plasma density and pellet injection as a hybrid system and propose two
MPC strategies for density control: mixed-integer (MI) MPC using a conventional
mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver and MPC utilizing our novel modification
of the penalty term homotopy (PTH) algorithm. By relaxing the integer
requirements, the PTH algorithm transforms the MIP problem into a series of
continuous optimization problems, reducing computational complexity. Our novel
modification to the PTH algorithm ensures that it can handle path constraints,
making it viable for constrained hybrid MPC in general. Both strategies perform
well with regards to reference tracking without violating path constraints and
satisfy the computation time limit for real-time control of the pellet
injection system. However, the computation time of the PTH-based MPC strategy
consistently outpaces the conventional MI-MPC strategy.

challenging task in computer animation, and its implications extend to games,
simulations, and virtual reality. Recent studies have drawn inspiration from
the success of diffusion models in image generation, demonstrating the
potential for addressing this task. However, the majority of these studies have
been limited to offline applications that target at sequence-level generation
that generates all steps simultaneously. To enable real-time motion synthesis
with diffusion models in response to time-varying control signals, we propose
the framework of the Controllable Motion Diffusion Model (COMODO). Our
framework begins with an auto-regressive motion diffusion model (A-MDM), which
generates motion sequences step by step. In this way, simply using the standard
DDPM algorithm without any additional complexity, our framework is able to
generate high-fidelity motion sequences over extended periods with different
types of control signals. Then, we propose our reinforcement learning-based
controller and controlling strategies on top of the A-MDM model, so that our
framework can steer the motion synthesis process across multiple tasks,
including target reaching, joystick-based control, goal-oriented control, and
trajectory following. The proposed framework enables the real-time generation
of diverse motions that react adaptively to user commands on-the-fly, thereby
enhancing the overall user experience. Besides, it is compatible with the
inpainting-based editing methods and can predict much more diverse motions
without additional fine-tuning of the basic motion generation models. We
conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our
framework in performing various tasks and compare its performance against
state-of-the-art methods.

by an expression involving two constants that depend on the observable and the
properties of the system. In equilibrium, we identify these constants with the
low- and high-frequency limit of the spectral density, respectively; thus, the
spectrum at arbitrary frequency is bounded by the short- and long-time behavior
of the observable. Out of equilibrium, on the other hand, the constants can no

peaks that correspond to oscillations in the dynamics. We show that the height
of these peaks is related to dissipation, allowing to infer the degree to which
the system is out of equilibrium from the measured spectrum.

double-diffusive mixed convective flow in a vertical channel with viscosity
stratification. The viscosity of the fluid is modelled as an exponential
function of temperature and concentration, with an activation energy parameter
determining its sensitivity to temperature variation. Three scenarios are
considered: buoyancy force due to thermal diffusion only, buoyancy force due to
temperature and solute acting in the same direction, and buoyancy force due to
temperature and solute acting in opposite directions. A generalized eigenvalue
problem is derived and solved numerically for linear stability analysis via the
Chebyshev spectral collocation method. Results indicate that higher values of
the activation energy parameter lead to increased flow stability. Additionally,
when both buoyant forces act in opposite directions, the Schmidt number has
both stabilizing and destabilizing effects across the range of activation
energy parameters, similar to the case of pure thermal diffusion. Furthermore,
the solutal-buoyancy-opposed base flow is found to be the most stable, while
the solutal-buoyancy-assisted base flow is the least stable. As expected, an
increase in Reynolds number is shown to decrease the critical Rayleigh number.

networks to work in open environments. CL enables a system to learn new tasks
without severe interference to its performance on old tasks, i.e., overcome the
problems of catastrophic forgetting. In joint learning, it is well known that
the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem caused by intentional attacks or
environmental perturbations will severely impair the ability of networks to
generalize. In this work, we reported a special form of catastrophic forgetting
raised by the OOD problem in continual learning settings, and we named it
out-of-distribution forgetting (OODF). In continual image classification tasks,
we found that for a given category, introducing an intra-class distribution
shift significantly impaired the recognition accuracy of CL methods for that
category during subsequent learning. Interestingly, this phenomenon is special
for CL as the same level of distribution shift had only negligible effects in
the joint learning scenario. We verified that CL methods without dedicating
subnetworks for individual tasks are all vulnerable to OODF. Moreover, OODF
does not depend on any specific way of shifting the distribution, suggesting it
is a risk for CL in a wide range of circumstances. Taken together, our work
identified an under-attended risk during CL, highlighting the importance of
developing approaches that can overcome OODF.

Time-to-Digital Converter with high resolution, optimized for both integration

converter is based on a three-step architecture. The first step uses a counter
whereas the following ones are based on two kinds of Delay Line structures. A
programmable time amplifier is used between the second and third steps to reach
the final resolution of 24.4 ps in the standard mode of operation. The system
makes use of common continuously stabilized master blocks that control
trimmable slave blocks, in each channel, against the effects of global PVT
variations. Thanks to this structure, the power consumption of a channel is
considerably reduced when it does not process a hit, and limited to 2.2 mW when
it processes a hit. In the 130 nm CMOS technology used for the prototype, the
area of a TDC channel is only 0.051 mm2. This compactness combined with low
power consumption is a key advantage for integration in multi-channel front-end
chips. The performance of this new structure has been evaluated on prototype
chips. Measurements show excellent timing performance over a wide range of
operating temperatures (-40{\deg}C to 60{\deg}C) in agreement with our
expectations. For example, the measured timing integral nonlinearity is better

a variety of task-oriented dialogue domains without the cost of collecting
in-domain data. Existing works mainly study common data- or model-level
augmentation methods to enhance the generalization but fail to effectively
decouple the semantics of samples, limiting the zero-shot performance of DST.
In this paper, we present a simple and effective ""divide, conquer and combine""
solution, which explicitly disentangles the semantics of seen data, and
leverages the performance and robustness with the mixture-of-experts mechanism.
Specifically, we divide the seen data into semantically independent subsets and
train corresponding experts, the newly unseen samples are mapped and inferred
with mixture-of-experts with our designed ensemble inference. Extensive
experiments on MultiWOZ2.1 upon the T5-Adapter show our schema significantly
and consistently improves the zero-shot performance, achieving the SOTA on

categorize commonly-seen multi-answer MRC instances, with which we inspect
three multi-answer datasets and analyze where the multi-answer challenge comes

some paradigms capture well the key information in the questions while others
better model the relationship between questions and contexts. We thus explore
strategies to make the best of the strengths of different paradigms.

on recent Swift and NICER follow-up observations to constrain the source's
current activity and overall lifetime, as well as an optical spectral
follow-up. The first two Swift detections and the first half of the 30 ks
XMM-Newton exposure of Tormund displayed a decaying thermal emission typical of
an X-ray TDE. However, the second half of the exposure showed a dramatic rise
in temperature (from 53 to 114 eV) and 0.2-2 keV luminosity (from
$3.2\times10^{42}$ to $1.2\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$). The late-time NICER
follow-up indicates that the source is still X-ray bright more than three years
after the initial optical TDE. Although only a rise phase was observed,
Tormund's strong similarities with a known QPE source (eRO-QPE1) and the
impossibility to simultaneously account for all observational features with
alternative interpretations allow us to classify Tormund as a candidate QPE. If
confirmed as a QPE, it would further strengthen the observational link between
TDEs and QPEs. It is also the first QPE candidate for which an associated

challenges of this task arise from low-contrast, small objects, and mimicry of
aquatic organisms. The key to addressing these challenges is to focus the model
on obtaining more discriminative information. We observe that the edges of
underwater objects are highly unique and can be distinguished from low-contrast
or mimicry environments based on their edges. Motivated by this observation, we
propose an Edge-guided Representation Learning Network, termed ERL-Net, that
aims to achieve discriminative representation learning and aggregation under
the guidance of edge cues. Firstly, we introduce an edge-guided attention
module to model the explicit boundary information, which generates more
discriminative features. Secondly, a feature aggregation module is proposed to
aggregate the multi-scale discriminative features by regrouping them into three
levels, effectively aggregating global and local information for locating and
recognizing underwater objects. Finally, we propose a wide and asymmetric
receptive field block to enable features to have a wider receptive field,
allowing the model to focus on more small object information. Comprehensive
experiments on three challenging underwater datasets show that our method

the hydrological processes in watersheds. In particular, the modeling of time
lags associated with the time between rainfall occurrence and subsequent
changes in streamflow, is of high practical importance. Since water can take a
variety of flowpaths to generate streamflow, a series of distinct runoff pulses
from different flowpath may combine to create the observed streamflow time
series. Current state-of-the-art models are not able to sufficiently confront
the problem complexity with interpretable parametrization, which would allow
insights into the dynamics of the distinct flow paths for hydrological
inference. The proposed Gaussian Sliding Windows Regression Model targets this
problem by combining the concept of multiple windows sliding along the time
axis with multiple linear regression. The window kernels, which indicate the
weights applied to different time lags, are implemented via Gaussian-shaped
kernels. As a result, each window can represent one flowpath and, thus, offers
the potential for straightforward process inference. Experiments on simulated
and real-world scenarios underline that the proposed model achieves accurate

between meshes of different resolution is crucial in cardiac electromechanics
simulations. We present a novel method that combines rescaled localized Radial
Basis Function (RBF) interpolation with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to
preserve the positivity of the determinant of the deformation gradient tensor.
The method involves decomposing the evaluations of the tensor at the quadrature
nodes of the source mesh into rotation matrices and diagonal matrices of
singular values; computing the RBF interpolation of the quaternion
representation of rotation matrices and the singular value logarithms;
reassembling the deformation gradient tensors at quadrature nodes of the
destination mesh, to be used in the assembly of the electrophysiology model
equations. The proposed method overcomes limitations of existing interpolation
methods, including nested intergrid interpolation and RBF interpolation of the
displacement field, that may lead to the loss of physical meaningfulness of the
mathematical formulation and then to solver failures at the algebraic level,
due to negative determinant values. The proposed method enables the transfer of
solution variables between finite element spaces of different degrees and
shapes and without stringent conformity requirements between different meshes,
enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of electromechanical simulations.
Numerical results confirm that the proposed method enables the transfer of the
deformation gradient tensor, allowing to successfully run simulations in cases
where existing methods fail. This work provides an efficient and robust method
for the intergrid transfer of the deformation gradient tensor, enabling
independent tailoring of mesh discretizations to the particular characteristics
of the physical components concurring to the of the multiphysics model.

deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and
individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical
variant considers {\it fitness proportional} selection, but other fitness
schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al.
([EPW09]) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the
``near-critical'' regime that was in the focus of [EPW09] (and in which the
mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as $N\to \infty$). Using a
Moran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click
rate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results
on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with
(binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet)
follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.
  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of
dual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph
with a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio
remains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics
of the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between
clicks. We will describe how these ideas can be extended to the near-critical
regime in which the mutation-selection ratio of the tournament ratchet
converges to 1 as $N\to \infty$.

in functional data analysis and local linear smoothing techniques are most
frequently used. Zhang and Wang (2016) explored different types of asymptotic
properties of the estimation, which reveal interesting phase transition
phenomena based on the relative order of the average sampling frequency per
subject $T$ to the number of subjects $n$, partitioning the data into three
categories: ``sparse'', ``semi-dense'' and ``ultra-dense''. In an increasingly
available high-dimensional scenario, where the number of functional variables
$p$ is large in relation to $n$, we revisit this open problem from a
non-asymptotic perspective by deriving comprehensive concentration inequalities
for the local linear smoothers. Besides being of interest by themselves, our
non-asymptotic results lead to elementwise maximum rates of $L_2$ convergence
and uniform convergence serving as a fundamentally important tool for further
convergence analysis when $p$ grows exponentially with $n$ and possibly $T$.
With the presence of extra $\log p$ terms to account for the high-dimensional
effect, we then investigate the scaled phase transitions and the corresponding
elementwise maximum rates from sparse to semi-dense to ultra-dense functional
data in high dimensions. Finally, numerical studies are carried out to confirm
our established theoretical properties.

  Efficient Fine-Tuning","Code at https://github.com/BaohaoLiao/mefts",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained language models (PLMs)
has emerged as a highly successful approach, with training only a small number
of parameters without sacrificing performance and becoming the de-facto
learning paradigm with the increasing size of PLMs. However, existing PEFT
methods are not memory-efficient, because they still require caching most of
the intermediate activations for the gradient calculation, akin to fine-tuning.
One effective way to reduce the activation memory is to apply a reversible
model, so the intermediate activations are not necessary to be cached and can
be recomputed. Nevertheless, modifying a PLM to its reversible variant with
PEFT is not straightforward, since the reversible model has a distinct
architecture from the currently released PLMs. In this paper, we first
investigate what is a key factor for the success of existing PEFT methods, and
realize that it's essential to preserve the PLM's starting point when
initializing a PEFT method. With this finding, we propose memory-efficient
fine-tuning (MEFT) that inserts adapters into a PLM, preserving the PLM's
starting point and making it reversible without additional pre-training. We
evaluate MEFT on the GLUE benchmark and five question-answering tasks with
various backbones, BERT, RoBERTa, BART and OPT. MEFT significantly reduces the
activation memory up to 84% of full fine-tuning with a negligible amount of
trainable parameters. Moreover, MEFT achieves the same score on GLUE and a
comparable score on the question-answering tasks as full fine-tuning.

In
these applications, complete diffusion histories play an essential role in
terms of identifying dynamical patterns, reflecting on precaution actions, and
forecasting intervention effects. Despite their importance, complete diffusion
histories are rarely available and are highly challenging to reconstruct due to
ill-posedness, explosive search space, and scarcity of training data. To date,
few methods exist for diffusion history reconstruction. They are exclusively
based on the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) formulation and require to
know true diffusion parameters. In this paper, we study an even harder problem,
namely reconstructing Diffusion history from A single SnapsHot} (DASH), where
we seek to reconstruct the history from only the final snapshot without knowing
true diffusion parameters. We start with theoretical analyses that reveal a
fundamental limitation of the MLE formulation. We prove: (a) estimation error
of diffusion parameters is unavoidable due to NP-hardness of diffusion
parameter estimation, and (b) the MLE formulation is sensitive to estimation
error of diffusion parameters. To overcome the inherent limitation of the MLE
formulation, we propose a novel barycenter formulation: finding the barycenter
of the posterior distribution of histories, which is provably stable against
the estimation error of diffusion parameters. We further develop an effective
solver named DIffusion hiTting Times with Optimal proposal (DITTO) by reducing
the problem to estimating posterior expected hitting times via the
Metropolis--Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo method (M--H MCMC) and employing
an unsupervised graph neural network to learn an optimal proposal to accelerate
the convergence of M--H MCMC. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed method.

unfavorable decision by a machine learning system. But so far very little
attention has been paid to whether providing recourse is beneficial or not. We
introduce an abstract learning-theoretic framework that compares the risks
(i.e. expected losses) for classification with and without algorithmic
recourse. This allows us to answer the question of when providing recourse is
beneficial or harmful at the population level. Surprisingly, we find that there
are many plausible scenarios in which providing recourse turns out to be
harmful, because it pushes users to regions of higher class uncertainty and
therefore leads to more mistakes. We further study whether the party deploying
the classifier has an incentive to strategize in anticipation of having to
provide recourse, and we find that sometimes they do, to the detriment of their
users. Providing algorithmic recourse may therefore also be harmful at the
systemic level. We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments on simulated
and real-world data. All in all, we conclude that the current concept of
algorithmic recourse is not reliably beneficial, and therefore requires
rethinking.

from domain shift, where the models trained on a source domain do not
generalize well to other unseen domains. As a vision foundation model with
powerful generalization capabilities, Segment Anything Model (SAM) shows
potential for improving the cross-domain robustness of medical image
segmentation. However, SAM and its fine-tuned models performed significantly
worse in fully automatic mode compared to when given manual prompts. Upon
further investigation, we discovered that the degradation in performance was
related to the coupling effect of poor prompts and mask segmentation. In fully
automatic mode, the presence of inevitable poor prompts (such as points outside
the mask or boxes significantly larger than the mask) can significantly mislead
mask generation. To address the coupling effect, we propose the decoupling SAM
(DeSAM). DeSAM modifies SAM's mask decoder to decouple mask generation and
prompt embeddings while leveraging pre-trained weights. We conducted
experiments on publicly available prostate cross-site datasets. The results
show that DeSAM improves dice score by an average of 8.96% (from 70.06% to
79.02%) compared to previous state-of-the-art domain generalization method.
Moreover, DeSAM can be trained on personal devices with entry-level GPU since
our approach does not rely on tuning the heavyweight image encoder. The code is

sporadic nature. A single long-distance trip can amount to a distance

just as relevant for such trips. As international travel is slowly picking up
from the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been marred by an abundance of national and
regional pandemic-related safety measures. While their primary goal is to
protect the local population from infection, these safety may also make
travellers feel safer while travelling. This perceived safety can - and likely
does - differ from the true efficacy of the measures. In this research, we
investigate people's perception of eight COVID-19-related safety measures
related to long-distance trips and how subjective perception of safety impacts
their mode choice among car, train and aircraft. We employ a Hierarchical
Information Integration (HII) approach to capture subjective perceptions and
then model the obtained data by means of a Latent Class Choice Model, resulting
in four distinct segments. To extrapolate the segments onto the rating

obtain segment-specific safety perception. Two segments show a relatively high
value-of-time (72EUR/h and 50EUR/h), tend to be more mode-agnostic and prefer
determining the level of risk by themselves (relying primarily on infection and
vaccination rate). The remaining two segments have a lower value-of-time (38EUR

introduction of Diffusion Models, which learn to progressively reverse a given
image corruption. Recently, a few studies introduced alternative ways of
corrupting images in Diffusion Models, with an emphasis on blurring. However,
these studies are purely empirical and it remains unclear what is the optimal
procedure for corrupting an image. In this work, we hypothesize that the
optimal procedure minimizes the length of the path taken when corrupting an
image towards a given final state. We propose the Fisher metric for the path
length, measured in the space of probability distributions. We compute the
shortest path according to this metric, and we show that it corresponds to a
combination of image sharpening, rather than blurring, and noise deblurring.
While the corruption was chosen arbitrarily in previous work, our Shortest Path
Diffusion (SPD) determines uniquely the entire spatiotemporal structure of the
corruption. We show that SPD improves on strong baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning, and outperforms all previous Diffusion Models based on
image blurring. Furthermore, any small deviation from the shortest path leads
to worse performance, suggesting that SPD provides the optimal procedure to
corrupt images. Our work sheds new light on observations made in recent works

linking distant partners Alice and Bob. The pairwise entanglement existing in
symmetric and antisymmetric multipartite coherent states is explored, and by
controlling the overlap and number of probes constructing various types of
quantum channels, the teleportation efficiency of teleported states in both

estimated to explore their roles in our protocol using two kinds of quantum
statistical speed referred to as quantum Fisher information (QFI) and
Hilbert-Schmidt speed (HSS). Specifically, we show that the lower bound of the
statistical estimation error, quantified by QFI and HSS, corresponds to the
highest fidelity from Alice to Bob and conversely from Bob to Alice, and that
the choice of the pre-shared quantum channel has a critical role in achieving
high BQT efficiency. Finally, we show how to implement the suggested scheme on
current experimental tools, where Alice can transfer her even coherent state to
Bob, and at the same time, Bob can transfer his odd coherent state to Alice.

the bulk-electron temperature evolution after laser irradiation. As a showcase,
a study of isochoric heating of solid hydrogen induced by laser pulses with a

with extended charged rotating particle. The solitons are stationary solutions
which correspond to a uniform motion and rotation of the particle. The charge
density of the particle is spherically symmetric, and in this case the solitons
exist for any velocity $v\in\mathbb{R}^3$ with $|v|<1$ and angular velocity of
rotation $\omega\in\mathbb{R}^3$ if either $\omega\Vert v$ or $\omega\bot v$.
Our main result is that all the solitons are orbitally stable under two
conditions on the charge density of the particle: the density is spherically
symmetric and is not identically zero. To prove the stability, we apply the
Hamilton--Poisson representation of the Maxwell--Lorentz system constructed in
our previous paper.The construction relies on the Hamilton least action
principle and the Lie--Poincar\'e calculus. The constructed structure is
degenerate and admits the Casimir invariants.
  This structure allows us to construct the Lyapunov function corresponding to
a soliton, reducing the system via canonical transformation to a comoving
frame. The function is a linear combination of the Hamiltonian and the Casimir
invariant. The function is conserved, and the soliton is its critical point.
The key point of the proof is a lower bound for the Lyapunov function. This
bound implies that the soliton is a strict local minimizer of the function. The
proof of the bound for $\omega=0$ is rather simple and use only the spherical
symmetry. For $\omega\ne 0$, the lower bound holds if and only if,
additionally, the charge density is not identically zero. The proof relies on
suitable spectral arguments including the Heinz inequality from the theory of
interpolation. The results are extended to the case of relativistic particle.

that fossil outflows should be common in gas-poor galaxies but form only rarely
in gas-rich ones; in general, fossil outflows should outnumber driven ones by a
factor of a few in the local Universe, and possibly more at high redshift. When
they do form, fossil outflows tend to be lopsided and detached from the
nucleus, and colder than their driven counterparts, with a more prominent
molecular phase. Spatially resolved and/or multiphase observations can help
distinguish fossil AGN outflows from star formation-driven ones, which have
similar integrated properties. We discuss a number of spatially-resolved
observations of outflows, suggesting that most show evidence of fossil outflow

spatial density such that $\|\rho_f(t,\cdot)\|_{L^p} \sim p^{1/\alpha}$ for

for MRI datasets with partially acquired scans. We show that this latent space
can be utilized for accelerated MR image reconstruction.
  Theory and Methods: Our novel framework, referred to as COLADA (stands for
Contrastive Learning for highly accelerated MR image reconstruction), maximizes
the mutual information between differently accelerated images of an MRI scan by
using self-supervised contrastive learning. In other words, it attempts to
""pull"" the latent representations of the same scan together and ""push"" the
latent representations of other scans away. The generated MRI latent space is
subsequently utilized for MR image reconstruction and the performance was
assessed in comparison to several baseline deep learning reconstruction
methods. Furthermore, the quality of the proposed latent space representation
was analyzed using Alignment and Uniformity.
  Results: COLADA comprehensively outperformed other reconstruction methods
with robustness to variations in undersampling patterns, pathological
abnormalities, and noise in k-space during inference. COLADA proved the high
quality of reconstruction on unseen data with minimal fine-tuning. The analysis
of representation quality suggests that the contrastive features produced by
COLADA are optimally distributed in latent space.
  Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
utilize contrastive learning on differently accelerated images for MR image
reconstruction. The proposed latent space representation has practical usage
due to a large number of existing partially sampled datasets. This implies the
possibility of exploring self-supervised contrastive learning further to
enhance the latent space of MRI for image reconstruction.

that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses,
morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent pattern without stabilizing
positional cues. The pattern then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically
noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. But remarkably, the
established gene expression patterns remain spatially and temporally stable in
many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an
enhanced sampling method and a recently developed stability theory to address
how spatiotemporal integrity of a gene expression pattern is maintained in
developing tissue lacking morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model
consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe
pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians
alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains,
inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that
fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level can
significantly increase temporal stability of the expression patterns, allowing
for stable patterns over developmentally relevant times in the absence of
morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameters closely
agree with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics
of factors characterizing pattern integrity, we trace back the stability
enhancement to the emergence of restoring forces, maintaining the pattern in a
meta-stable basin. Altogether our results demonstrate that metastable
attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic gene expression patterns even
without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory
interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.

places restrictive assumptions, such as linearity, on the mixing function or

interventional data. We study the fundamental setting of two causal variables
and prove that the observational distribution and one perfect intervention per
node suffice for identifiability, subject to a genericity condition. This
condition rules out spurious solutions that involve fine-tuning of the
intervened and observational distributions, mirroring similar conditions for
nonlinear cause-effect inference. For an arbitrary number of variables, we show
that two distinct paired perfect interventions per node guarantee
identifiability. Further, we demonstrate that the strengths of causal
influences among the latent variables are preserved by all equivalent

  Learning Framework with Masked Image Modeling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driver distraction causes a significant number of traffic accidents every
year, resulting in economic losses and casualties. Currently, the level of
automation in commercial vehicles is far from completely unmanned, and drivers
still play an important role in operating and controlling the vehicle.
Therefore, driver distraction behavior detection is crucial for road safety. At
present, driver distraction detection primarily relies on traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and supervised learning methods. However,
there are still challenges such as the high cost of labeled datasets, limited
ability to capture high-level semantic information, and weak generalization
performance. In order to solve these problems, this paper proposes a new
self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling for driver
distraction behavior detection. Firstly, a self-supervised learning framework
for masked image modeling (MIM) is introduced to solve the serious human and
material consumption issues caused by dataset labeling. Secondly, the Swin
Transformer is employed as an encoder. Performance is enhanced by reconfiguring
the Swin Transformer block and adjusting the distribution of the number of
window multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) and shifted window multi-head
self-attention (SW-MSA) detection heads across all stages, which leads to model
more lightening. Finally, various data augmentation strategies are used along
with the best random masking strategy to strengthen the model's recognition and
generalization ability. Test results on a large-scale driver distraction
behavior dataset show that the self-supervised learning method proposed in this
paper achieves an accuracy of 99.60%, approximating the excellent performance
of advanced supervised learning methods.

large flaring activity mainly occurs. We perform time-resolved spectroscopy on
the source by extracting spectra for two different intensity intervals. The

of the absorbing column density ($\rm{N_{H}}\sim 1.1\times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$),
and it appears to be uncorrelated with the observed flux of the source. Each
spectrum shows evidence of Fe K$\alpha$ emission in the $5-7$\kev{} energy
band, an absorption edge around $\sim 7-8$\kev{}, and a broad Compton hump
above $15$\kev{}, indicating the presence of a reflection spectrum. The
observed features are well explained by the contribution of a relativistic
reflection model and a partially covering absorption model. From the best-fit

This driving voltage is approx. 5 - 7 times lower compared to other

Distance (CLGD), which computes the difference between the underlying 3D

each reference point with two given point clouds through computing its
directional distances to them, the difference in directional distances of an
identical reference point characterizes the geometric difference between a
typical local region of the two point clouds. Finally, CLGD is obtained by
averaging the directional distance differences of all reference points. We
evaluate CLGD on various optimization and unsupervised learning-based tasks,
including shape reconstruction, rigid registration, scene flow estimation, and

significantly higher accuracy under all tasks in a memory and computationally

drastically improved performance. In ambiguous or even unpredictable real-world
scenarios, this overconfidence can pose a major risk to the safety of
applications. For regression tasks, the regression-by-classification approach
has the potential to alleviate these ambiguities by instead predicting a
discrete probability density over the desired output. However, a density
estimator still tends to be overconfident when trained with the common NLL
loss. To mitigate the overconfidence problem, we propose a loss function,
hinge-Wasserstein, based on the Wasserstein Distance. This loss significantly
improves the quality of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, compared to
previous work. We demonstrate the capabilities of the new loss on a synthetic
dataset, where both types of uncertainty are controlled separately. Moreover,
as a demonstration for real-world scenarios, we evaluate our approach on the
benchmark dataset Horizon Lines in the Wild. On this benchmark, using the
hinge-Wasserstein loss reduces the Area Under Sparsification Error (AUSE) for
horizon parameters slope and offset, by 30.47% and 65.00%, respectively.

general-purpose audio representations. However, they do not address two key
aspects of modelling multi-domain audio data: (i) real-world audio tasks
consist of a combination of local+global contexts, and (ii) real-world audio
signals are complex compositions of several acoustic elements with different
time-frequency characteristics. To address these concerns, this work proposes a
Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window
Multi-Head Attention module that can capture information at multiple local and
global contexts in every decoder transformer block through attention heads of
several distinct local and global windows. Empirical results on ten downstream
audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall
performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, as well as
demonstrate considerably better scaling characteristics. Exploratory analyses
of the learned representations reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn attention
heads with more distinct entropies compared to those learned by MAEs, while
attention heads across the different transformer blocks in MW-MAE decoders
learn correlated feature representations, enabling each block to independently
capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled feature hierarchy.

We show that under load, the system self-organizes to a metastable state poised

The system's relaxation is intermittent, advancing via rapid sequences of
instabilities, grouped into self-similar, aging avalanches. Crucially, the

is to fully redevelop the study of this problem in the 1D case, and to prove a
\emph{sharp local well-posedness} result.
  The second goal of this article is to consider the long time/global existence
of solutions for the same problem. This is motivated by a broad conjecture
formulated by the authors in earlier work, which reads as follows:
``\emph{Cubic defocusing dispersive one dimensional flows with small initial
data have global dispersive solutions}''; the conjecture was initially proved
for a well chosen semilinear model of Schr\""odinger type.

Schr\""{o}dinger flows. Precisely, we show that if the problem has \emph{phase
rotation symmetry} and is \emph{conservative and defocusing}, then small data
in Sobolev spaces yields global, scattering solutions. This is the first result
of this type for 1D quasilinear dispersive flows. Furthermore, we prove it at
the minimal Sobolev regularity in our local well-posedness result.
  The defocusing condition is essential in our global result. Without it, the
authors have conjectured that \emph{small, $\epsilon$ size data yields long
time solutions on the $\epsilon^{-8}$ time-scale}. A third goal of this paper
is to also prove this second conjecture for 1D quasilinear Schr\""{o}dinger

of the RGB SLAM system. To this end, we first build up a theoretical analysis
by decomposing the SLAM system into tracking and mapping parts, and the mapping
uncertainty is explicitly defined within the frame of neural representations.
Based on the analysis, we then propose an effective factorization scheme for
scene representation and introduce a sliding window strategy to reduce the
uncertainty for scene reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage the factorized
neural field to decompose uncertainty into a lower-dimensional space, which
enhances robustness to noise and improves training efficiency. We then propose
the sliding window sampler to reduce uncertainty by incorporating coherent
geometric cues from observed frames during map initialization to enhance
convergence. Our factorized neural mapping approach enjoys some advantages,

convergence during map initialization. Experiments on two benchmark datasets
show that our method can update the map of high-fidelity colorized point clouds

  arXiv:2008.07574",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Large increases in visuomotor feedback gains occur during initial adaptation
to novel dynamics, which we propose are due to increased internal model
uncertainty. That is, large errors indicate increased uncertainty in our
prediction of the environment, increasing feedback gains and co-contraction as
a coping mechanism. Our previous work showed distinct patterns of visuomotor
feedback gains during abrupt or gradual adaptation to a force field, suggesting
two complementary processes: reactive feedback gains increasing with internal
model uncertainty and the gradual learning of predictive feedback gains tuned
to the environment. Here we further investigate what drives these changes
visuomotor feedback gains in learning, by separating the effects of internal
model uncertainty from visual error signal through removal of visual error
information. Removing visual error information suppresses the visuomotor
feedback gains in all conditions, but the pattern of modulation throughout
adaptation is unaffected. Moreover, we find increased muscle co-contraction in
both abrupt and gradual adaptation protocols, demonstrating that visuomotor
feedback responses are independent from the level of co-contraction. Our result
suggests that visual feedback benefits motor adaptation tasks through higher
visuomotor feedback gains, but when it is not available participants adapt at a
similar rate through increased co-contraction. We have demonstrated a direct
connection between learning and predictive visuomotor feedback gains,
independent from visual error signals. This further supports our hypothesis
that internal model uncertainty drives initial increases in feedback gains.

Gauge Theory becomes challenging as we approach the continuum limit of the
theory. In this work, we introduce a Conditional Normalizing Flow (C-NF) model
to sample U(1) gauge theory in two dimensions, aiming to mitigate the impact of
topological freezing when dealing with smaller values of the U(1) bare
coupling. To train the conditional flow model, we utilize samples generated by
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) method, ensuring that the autocorrelation in
topological quantities remains low. Subsequently, we employ the trained model
to interpolate the coupling parameter to values where training was not
performed. We thoroughly examine the quality of the model in this region and
generate uncorrelated samples, significantly reducing the occurrence of
topological freezing. Furthermore, we propose a re-trainable approach that
utilizes the model's own samples to enhance the generalization capability of
the conditional model. This method enables sampling for coupling values that
are far beyond the initial training region, expanding the applicability of the
model.

challenging to observe, and require sub-millimeter instruments with a high

[OIII] line emissions of galaxies. We use the high-resolution cosmological
zoom-in simulation Ponos, representing a star forming galaxy system at z = 6.5
($M_*=2\times10^9~M_{\odot}$), undergoing a major merger. We adopt different
modeling approaches based on the photoionisation code Cloudy. Our fiducial
model uses radiative transfer post-processing with RamsesRT and Krome to create
realistic FUV radiation fields, which we compare to sub-grid modeling
approaches adopted in the literature. We find significant differences in the
luminosity and in the contribution of different gas phases and galaxy
components between the different modeling approaches. [CII] is the least
model-dependant gas tracer, while [CI](1-0) and CO(3-2) are very
model-sensitive. In all models, we find a significant contribution to the
emission of [CII] (up to $\sim$10%) and [OIII] (up to $\sim$20%) from the CGM.
[CII] and [OIII] trace different regions of the CGM: [CII] arises from an
accreting filament and from tidal tails, while [OIII] traces a puffy halo
surrounding the main disc, probably linked to SN feedback. We discuss our

providing an isomorphism between them: that is, a one-to-one correspondence

insight and generate powerful techniques to study the involved structures, by
cross-fertilising between the methodologies existing for each of the respective

connection, however, such results can be, by their own nature, elusive. Here,
we show how data-mining across distinct web sources (including the Online
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, OEIS), was crucial in the discovery of two
original representation theorems relating event structures (mathematical
structures commonly used to represent concurrent discrete systems) to families
of sets (endowed with elementary disjointness and subset relations) and to full
graphs, respectively. The latter originally emerged in the apparently unrelated
field of bioinformatics. As expected, our representation theorems are powerful,
allowing to capitalise on existing theorems about full graphs to immediately
conclude new facts about event structures. Our contribution is twofold: on one
hand, we illustrate our novel method to mine the web, resulting in thousands of
candidate connections between distinct mathematical realms; on the other hand,
we explore one of these connections to obtain our new representation theorems.
We hope this paper can encourage people with relevant expertise to scrutinize
these candidate connections. We anticipate that, building on the ideas
presented here, further connections can be unearthed, by refining the mining

strategic security interests, often stockpile such knowledge of vulnerabilities

enhance global IT security by disclosing vulnerabilities are currently being
discussed on the international level, these efforts are hindered by state
concerns about the disclosure of unique knowledge and about giving up tactical
advantages. This leads to a situation where multiple states are likely to
stockpile at least some identical exploits, with technical measures to enable a
depletion process for these stockpiles that preserve state secrecy interests

such a privacy-preserving approach that allows multiple state parties to

Vital discharge parameters, including electron density, electron temperature,
DC self-bias, and Electron Energy distribution function (EEDF), are studied
experimentally for varying magnetic field strength (B). A transition in the
discharge asymmetry is observed along with a range of magnetic fields where the
discharge is highly efficient with lower electron temperature. Outside this
range of magnetic field, the plasma density drops, followed by an increase in
the electron temperature. The observed behavior is attributed to the transition
from geometrical asymmetry to magnetic field-associated symmetry due to reduced
radial losses and plasma confinement in the peripheral region. In this region,
the DC self-bias increases almost linearly from a large negative value to
nearly zero, i.e., the discharge becomes symmetric. The EEDF undergoes a
transition from bi-Maxwellian for unmagnetized to Maxwellian at intermediate B

segments is calculated, where the event of the most similar prompt is regarded
as the segment-level label. In addition, to deal with the mislabeled segments,

networks comes with a variety of challenges to be solved. One of those is
clutter removal, which should be applied to remove the influence of unwanted
components, scattered by the environment, in the acquired sensing signal. While
legacy radar systems already implement different clutter removal algorithms,
ISAC requires techniques that are tailored to the envisioned use cases and the
specific challenges that communications deployments bring along, like phase
noise due to clock errors between transmitter and receiver. To that end, in
this work we introduce Clutter Removal with Acquisitions Under Phase Noise
(CRAP). We propose to vectorize the time-frequency channel acquired in a radio
frame in a high-dimensional space. In an offline clutter acquisition step,
singular value decomposition is used to determine the major clutter components.
At runtime, the clutter is then estimated and removed by a subspace projection
of the acquired radio frame onto the clutter components.
  Simulation results prove that CRAP offers benefits over prior art techniques
robust to phase noise. In particular, our proposal does not suppress zero
Doppler information, thereby enabling the detection of slow targets. Moreover,
we show CRAP's real-time applicability in a millimeter-wave ISAC proof of
concept, where a pedestrian is tracked in a cluttered lab environment.

intractable normalising constants and hard to satisfy boundary conditions.
Score matching can be adapted to solve the truncated density estimation
problem, but requires a continuous weighting function which takes zero at the
boundary and is positive elsewhere. Evaluation of such a weighting function
(and its gradient) often requires a closed-form expression of the truncation
boundary and finding a solution to a complicated optimisation problem. In this
paper, we propose approximate Stein classes, which in turn leads to a relaxed
Stein identity for truncated density estimation. We develop a novel discrepancy
measure, truncated kernelised Stein discrepancy (TKSD), which does not require
fixing a weighting function in advance, and can be evaluated using only samples
on the boundary. We estimate a truncated density model by minimising the
Lagrangian dual of TKSD. Finally, experiments show the accuracy of our method
to be an improvement over previous works even without the explicit functional
form of the boundary.

However, most existing works in the literature still focus on the online

real-time budget constraint problem under the offline setting, and propose
Trajectory-based REal-time Budget Inference (TREBI) as a novel solution that
approaches this problem from the perspective of trajectory distribution.
Theoretically, we prove an error bound of the estimation on the episodic reward

TREBI. Empirical results on a wide range of simulation tasks and a real-world
large-scale advertising application demonstrate the capability of TREBI in

learning-based methods are prone to predict off-road trajectories in
challenging scenarios. These can be created by perturbing existing scenarios
with additional turns in front of the target vehicle while the motion history
is left unchanged. We argue that this indicates that SotA models do not
consider the map information sufficiently and demonstrate how this can be
solved, by representing model inputs and outputs in a Frenet frame defined by
lane centreline sequences. To this end, we present a general wrapper that
leverages a Frenet representation of the scene and that can be applied to SotA
models without changing their architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
this approach in a comprehensive benchmark using two SotA motion prediction

Compared with ordinary IP cameras, spy cameras are normally sold in bulk at

workplaces. A security compromise of these cameras can have severe
consequences. In this paper, we analyse a generic IP camera module, which has
been packaged and re-branded for sale by several spy camera vendors. The module
is controlled by mobile phone apps. By analysing the Android app and the
traffic data, we reverse-engineered the security design of the whole system,
including the module's Linux OS environment, the file structure, the

Combined together, they allow an adversary to take complete control of a spy

indispensable for solving various classes of instances arising in practice.
However, the exploitation of symmetries usually takes a black box approach.
Typically, off-the-shelf external, general-purpose symmetry detection tools are
invoked to compute symmetry groups of a formula. The groups thus generated are
a set of permutations passed to a separate tool to perform further analyzes to
understand the structure of the groups. The result of this second computation
is in turn used for tasks such as static symmetry breaking or dynamic pruning
of the search space. Within this pipeline of tools, the detection and analysis
of symmetries typically incurs the majority of the time overhead for symmetry
exploitation.
  In this paper we advocate for a more holistic view of what we call the
SAT-symmetry interface. We formulate a computational setting, centered around a
new concept of joint graph/group pairs, to analyze and improve the detection
and analysis of symmetries. Using our methods, no information is lost
performing computational tasks lying on the SAT-symmetry interface. Having
access to the entire input allows for simpler, yet efficient algorithms.
  Specifically, we devise algorithms and heuristics for computing finest direct
disjoint decompositions, finding equivalent orbits, and finding natural
symmetric group actions. Our algorithms run in what we call
instance-quasi-linear time, i.e., almost linear time in terms of the input size
of the original formula and the description length of the symmetry group
returned by symmetry detection tools. Our algorithms improve over both
heuristics used in state-of-the-art symmetry exploitation tools, as well as
theoretical general-purpose algorithms.

super-logarithmic lower bounds on the depth of circuits (i.e.,
$\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^{1}$). Karchmer, Raz, and Wigderson
(Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995) suggested to approach this problem by
proving that depth complexity of a composition of functions $f\diamond g$ is
roughly the sum of the depth complexities of $f$ and $g$. They showed that the
validity of this conjecture would imply that
$\mathbf{P}\not\subseteq\mathbf{NC}^{1}$.
  The intuition that underlies the KRW conjecture is that the composition
$f\diamond g$ should behave like a ""direct-sum problem"", in a certain sense,
and therefore the depth complexity of $f\diamond g$ should be the sum of the
individual depth complexities. Nevertheless, there are two obstacles toward
turning this intuition into a proof: first, we do not know how to prove that
$f\diamond g$ must behave like a direct-sum problem; second, we do not know how
to prove that the complexity of the latter direct-sum problem is indeed the sum
of the individual complexities.
  In this work, we focus on the second obstacle. To this end, we study a notion
called ""strong composition"", which is the same as $f\diamond g$ except that it
is forced to behave like a direct-sum problem. We prove a variant of the KRW
conjecture for strong composition, thus overcoming the above second obstacle.
This result demonstrates that the first obstacle above is the crucial barrier
toward resolving the KRW conjecture. Along the way, we develop some general
techniques that might be of independent interest.

poorly in complex environments and lacks scalability in multiple scenarios and
high-dimensional real robot settings. To overcome these limitations, this paper

multiple inheritance; a ring is both a semiring and an abelian group.
  In the presence of dependently-typed typeclasses that themselves consume
typeclasses as type-parameters, such as a vector space typeclass which assumes
the presence of an existing additive structure, the implementation details of

is insufficient to obtain good prompts for all tasks and samples when the tasks

heavy burden on computation and memory as the MLM is usually large. To address
these issues, we use a prompt pool to extract more task knowledge and construct

OpenAssistant, StableLM), and (ii) prompting with a specific question (e.g., to
identify errors) outperforms prompting to simply write a review. With these
insights, we study the use of LLMs (specifically, GPT-4) for three tasks:
  1. Identifying errors: We construct 13 short computer science papers each
with a deliberately inserted error, and ask the LLM to check for the
correctness of these papers. We observe that the LLM finds errors in 7 of them,
spanning both mathematical and conceptual errors.
  2. Verifying checklists: We task the LLM to verify 16 closed-ended checklist
questions in the respective sections of 15 NeurIPS 2022 papers. We find that
across 119 {checklist question, paper} pairs, the LLM had an 86.6% accuracy.
  3. Choosing the ""better"" paper: We generate 10 pairs of abstracts,
deliberately designing each pair in such a way that one abstract was clearly
superior than the other. The LLM, however, struggled to discern these
relatively straightforward distinctions accurately, committing errors in its
evaluations for 6 out of the 10 pairs.
  Based on these experiments, we think that LLMs have a promising use as
reviewing assistants for specific reviewing tasks, but not (yet) for complete
evaluations of papers or proposals.

Nb$_4$CoSi is found to harbor better conditions for phonon-mediated

level, fostering stronger electron-phonon coupling. The superconducting
critical temperatures ($T_c$) follow the same trend, with Nb$_4$CoSi having a
twice higher value than Ta$_4$CoSi. Furthermore, the calculated $T_c$ values
(6.0 K vs. 3.2 K) agree excellently with the experimentally obtained ones,
establishing superconductivity in this new materials class as mediated by the

superconducting properties of these compounds do not simply correlate with the

highly influenced by the chosen loss (objective) function. The majority of
objective functions for neural models can be divided into metric learning and
statistical learning. Metric learning approaches require a pair mining strategy
that often lacks efficiency, while statistical learning approaches are not
generating highly compact features due to their indirect feature optimization.
To this end, we propose a novel repeller-attractor loss that falls in the
metric learning paradigm, yet directly optimizes for the L2 metric without the
need of generating pairs. Our loss is formed of three components. One leading
objective ensures that the learned features are attracted to each designated
learnable class anchor. The second loss component regulates the anchors and
forces them to be separable by a margin, while the third objective ensures that
the anchors do not collapse to zero. Furthermore, we develop a more efficient
two-stage retrieval system by harnessing the learned class anchors during the
first stage of the retrieval process, eliminating the need of comparing the
query with every image in the database. We establish a set of four datasets
(CIFAR-100, Food-101, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet) and evaluate the proposed
objective in the context of few-shot and full-set training on the CBIR task, by
using both convolutional and transformer architectures. Compared to existing
objective functions, our empirical evidence shows that the proposed objective

unavailable, such as underground areas and tunnels, GNSS simulators can be
deployed for transmitting simulated GNSS signals. Then, a GNSS receiver in the
simulator coverage outputs the position based on the received GNSS signals
(e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 signals in this study) transmitted by
the corresponding simulator. This approach provides periodic position updates
to GNSS users while deploying a small number of simulators without modifying
the hardware and software of user receivers. However, the simulator clock
should be synchronized to the GNSS satellite clock to generate almost identical
signals to the live-sky GNSS signals, which is necessary for seamless indoor
and outdoor positioning handover. The conventional clock synchronization method
based on the wired connection between each simulator and an outdoor GNSS
antenna causes practical difficulty and increases the cost of deploying the
simulators. This study proposes a wireless clock synchronization method based
on a private time server and time delay calibration. Additionally, we derived
the constraints for determining the optimal simulator coverage and separation
between adjacent simulators. The positioning performance of the proposed GPS
simulator-based indoor positioning system was demonstrated in the underground
testbed for a driving vehicle with a GPS receiver and a pedestrian with a
smartphone. The average position errors were 3.7 m for the vehicle and 9.6 m
for the pedestrian during the field tests with successful indoor and outdoor
positioning handovers. Since those errors are within the coverage of each
deployed simulator, it is confirmed that the proposed system with wireless
clock synchronization can effectively provide periodic position updates to
users where live-sky GNSS signals are unavailable.

  Implicit Parsers","Accepted by ACL 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent advancements in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated
that these models possess some degree of syntactic awareness. To leverage this
knowledge, we propose a novel chart-based method for extracting parse trees
from masked language models (LMs) without the need to train separate parsers.
Our method computes a score for each span based on the distortion of contextual
representations resulting from linguistic perturbations. We design a set of
perturbations motivated by the linguistic concept of constituency tests, and
use these to score each span by aggregating the distortion scores. To produce a
parse tree, we use chart parsing to find the tree with the minimum score. Our
method consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on English
with masked LMs, and also demonstrates superior performance in a multilingual
setting, outperforming the state of the art in 6 out of 8 languages. Notably,
although our method does not involve parameter updates or extensive
hyperparameter search, its performance can even surpass some unsupervised
parsing methods that require fine-tuning. Our analysis highlights that the
distortion of contextual representation resulting from syntactic perturbation
can serve as an effective indicator of constituency across languages.

relevant settings and define the entity as universal TTA. To tackle the problem
of universal TTA, we identify and highlight several challenges a self-training

trivial solutions when performing entropy minimization on varying sequence
lengths with and without multiple domain shifts, 2) loss of generalization
which exacerbates the adaptation to future domain shifts and the occurrence of
catastrophic forgetting, and 3) performance degradation due to shifts in label
prior. To prevent the model from becoming biased, we leverage a dataset and
model-agnostic certainty and diversity weighting. In order to maintain
generalization and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we propose to continually
weight-average the source and adapted model. To compensate for disparities in

that NeuroGFs exhibit exceptional performance in solving the single-source

However, their concept names are not always readily interpretable by

Clear definitions or descriptions in understandable language are often not

  Objective: In this article, we introduce the Automatic Glossary of Clinical
Terminology (AGCT), a large-scale biomedical dictionary of clinical concepts
generated using high-quality information extracted from the biomedical
knowledge contained in SnomedCT.
  Methods: We generate a novel definition for every SnomedCT concept, after
prompting the OpenAI Turbo model, a variant of GPT 3.5, using a high-quality
verbalization of the SnomedCT relationships of the to-be-defined concept. A
significant subset of the generated definitions was subsequently judged by NLP
researchers with biomedical expertise on 5-point scales along the following
three axes: factuality, insight, and fluency.
  Results: AGCT contains 422,070 computer-generated definitions for SnomedCT

anatomy. The average length of the definitions is 49 words. The definitions
were assigned average scores of over 4.5 out of 5 on all three axes, indicating

  Conclusion: AGCT is a novel and valuable resource for biomedical tasks that

the nonexistence of traveling waves for c<c* is investigated, and the minimal

  Algorithms for Structural Balance",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Structural balance theory studies stability in networks. Given a $n$-vertex
complete graph $G=(V,E)$ whose edges are labeled positive or negative, the
graph is considered \emph{balanced} if every triangle either consists of three
positive edges (three mutual ``friends''), or one positive edge and two
negative edges (two ``friends'' with a common ``enemy''). From a computational
perspective, structural balance turns out to be a special case of correlation
clustering with the number of clusters at most two. The two main algorithmic
problems of interest are: $(i)$ detecting whether a given graph is balanced, or
$(ii)$ finding a partition that approximates the \emph{frustration index},
i.e., the minimum number of edge flips that turn the graph balanced.
  We study these problems in the streaming model where edges are given one by
one and focus on \emph{memory efficiency}. We provide randomized single-pass
algorithms for: $(i)$ determining whether an input graph is balanced with
$O(\log{n})$ memory, and $(ii)$ finding a partition that induces a $(1 +
\varepsilon)$-approximation to the frustration index with $O(n \cdot
\text{polylog}(n))$ memory. We further provide several new lower bounds,
complementing different aspects of our algorithms such as the need for
randomization or approximation.
  To obtain our main results, we develop a method using pseudorandom generators
(PRGs) to sample edges between independently-chosen \emph{vertices} in graph
streaming. Furthermore, our algorithm that approximates the frustration index
improves the running time of the state-of-the-art correlation clustering with
two clusters (Giotis-Guruswami algorithm [SODA 2006]) from
$n^{O(1/\varepsilon^2)}$ to $O(n^2\log^3{n}/\varepsilon^2 + n\log n \cdot
(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1/\varepsilon^4)})$ time for
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation. These results may be of independent interest.

active galactic nucleus (CL-AGN) NGC 3516 over a long period of 25 years. The
observed change in the broad line profile may indicate a change in the geometry
of the broad line region (BLR). Using spectral line profiles, we aim to explore
changes in the kinematics and dimensions of the BLR in NGC 3516. We consider
two possible scenarios, i.e. changes in the broad-line emission are caused by a
decrease of ionization continuum emission or by the BLR obscuration by outer
dusty regions. With this investigation we aim to clarify the CL mechanism of
this AGN. We analyze the spectral band around the H$\beta$ line as well as the
broad H$\beta$ line parameters, and how they change in time. We model the
broad-line profiles assuming that there is an emission from the accretion disc
superposed with an emission from a surrounding region that is outside the disc.
We find that in the Type 1 activity phase, the BLR is very complex. There is a
clear disc-like BLR that contributes to the broad line wings and an additional
intermediate line region (ILR) that contributes to the line core. In the high
activity phase, the ILR emission is close to the center of the line (in some
cases slightly shifted to the red), whereas in the low activity phase (i.e.,
Type 2 phase), the ILR component has a significant shift to the blue,
indicating an outflow. We propose that the changing look mechanism in NGC 3516
is rather connected with the intrinsic effects than with an outer obscuring
region. It may still be possible that the dust has an important role in the low
activity phase when it is coming inside of the BLR, making a dusty BLR. In this
way, it causes a decrease in the ionization and recombination rates.

applications including Internet-of-things on cellular network raises the
concern of technical challenges such as privacy, heterogeneity and resource
efficiency.
  Federated learning is an effective way to enable AI over massive distributed
nodes with security.
  However, conventional works mostly focus on learning a single global model
for a unique task across the network, and are generally less competent to
handle multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios with stragglers at the expense of
acceptable computation and communication cost. Meanwhile, it is challenging to
ensure the privacy while maintain a coupled multi-task learning across multiple
base stations (BSs) and terminals. In this paper, inspired by the natural
cloud-BS-terminal hierarchy of cellular works, we provide a viable
resource-aware hierarchical federated MTL (RHFedMTL) solution to meet the
heterogeneity of tasks, by solving different tasks within the BSs and
aggregating the multi-task result in the cloud without compromising the
privacy. Specifically, a primal-dual method has been leveraged to effectively
transform the coupled MTL into some local optimization sub-problems within BSs.
Furthermore, compared with existing methods to reduce resource cost by simply
changing the aggregation frequency,
  we dive into the intricate relationship between resource consumption and
learning accuracy, and develop a resource-aware learning strategy for local
terminals and BSs to meet the resource budget. Extensive simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of RHFedMTL in terms of improving
the learning accuracy and boosting the convergence rate.

Secondly, to fully exploit local spatial relationships and capture the
underlying geometric structure, a local region-based GLR is employed to
estimate the coefficients. Finally, the desired detection map is generated by
computing the ratio of representation errors from binary hypothesis testing.

MLWFs that describe only certain target manifolds separated in energy between

and maximal localization to construct orthogonal sets of MLWFs that fully and
only span the desired target submanifolds. The algorithm is simple and robust,

length becomes small which means the phase transition is easy to occur. The
difference of entanglement entropy between the connected and disconnected

transition and contributes to deconfinement. At finite temperature, we can see
that the difference of the entanglement entropy is also always negative and the

functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive
knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting
knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis
can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This
method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by
processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a
univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a
criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a
multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our
procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of
observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The
influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied
to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework
considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art
methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R
package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields, this model can be exactly mapped to the spin-1/2
effective detuned PXP Hamiltonian, where the SIA plays a role of static
detuning term. The quench dynamics starting from the product states are
symmetric between the positive and negative values of the SIA, while a quantum
phase transition from the Kitaev spin liquid to the dimer phase only occurs at
the critical point with a negative $D_c$, implies the spontaneous breaking of
the translational symmetry. We find that the coherent oscillations of quantum
fidelity and certain local observables are sustained against small SIA
perturbations in a quantum quench from special initial states. While the
oscillation amplitudes of these observables decay with time as the SIA strength
is increased, the system completely thermalizes upon approaching the critical
point. In contrast, the initial polarized state, which shows an absence of
revivals of quantum fidelity, will exhibit long revivals for $D<D_c$. We also
consider the perturbation of Heisenberg interactions which spoil the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields. A complete phase diagram is given by the infinite
time evolving block decimation method and the ground state properties of each

examining effective learning rates (LRs). Starting with the well-known fact
that batch normalization (BN) leads to exponentially exploding gradients at
initialization, we develop an ODE-based model to describe early training
dynamics. Our model predicts that in the gradient flow, effective LRs will
eventually equalize, aligning with empirical findings on warm-up training.
Using large LRs is analogous to applying an explicit solver to a stiff
non-linear ODE, causing overshooting and vanishing gradients in lower layers
after the first step. Achieving overall balance demands careful tuning of LRs,
depth, and (optionally) momentum. Our model predicts the formation of spreads
in effective LRs, consistent with empirical measurements. Moreover, we observe
that large spreads in effective LRs result in training issues concerning
accuracy, indicating the importance of controlling these dynamics. To further
support a causal relationship, we implement a simple scheduling scheme

of the flood extent. To address this issue, we propose a novel differential
attention metric-based network (DAM-Net) in this study. The DAM-Net comprises
two key components: a weight-sharing Siamese backbone to obtain multi-scale
change features of multi-temporal images and tokens containing high-level
semantic information of water-body changes, and a temporal differential fusion
(TDF) module that integrates semantic tokens and change features to generate
flood maps with reduced speckle noise. Specifically, the backbone is split into
multiple stages. In each stage, we design three modules, namely, temporal-wise
feature extraction (TWFE), cross-temporal change attention (CTCA), and
temporal-aware change enhancement (TACE), to effectively extract the change
features. In TACE of the last stage, we introduce a class token to record
high-level semantic information of water-body changes via the attention
mechanism. Another challenge faced by data-driven deep learning algorithms is
the limited availability of flood detection datasets. To overcome this, we have

  Sensing: The Role of Country Diversity",,,,,"cs.HC cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the social context of eating is crucial for promoting healthy
eating behaviors by providing timely interventions. Multimodal smartphone
sensing data has the potential to provide valuable insights into eating
behavior, particularly in mobile food diaries and mobile health applications.
However, research on the social context of eating with smartphone sensor data
is limited, despite extensive study in nutrition and behavioral science.
Moreover, the impact of country differences on the social context of eating, as
measured by multimodal phone sensor data and self-reports, remains
under-explored. To address this research gap, we present a study using a
smartphone sensing dataset from eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy,
Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, and the UK). Our study focuses on a set of
approximately 24K self-reports on eating events provided by 678 college
students to investigate the country diversity that emerges from smartphone
sensors during eating events for different social contexts (alone or with
others). Our analysis revealed that while some smartphone usage features during
eating events were similar across countries, others exhibited unique behaviors
in each country. We further studied how user and country-specific factors
impact social context inference by developing machine learning models with
population-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized)
experimental setups. We showed that models based on the hybrid approach achieve
AUC scores up to 0.75 with XGBoost models. These findings have implications for
future research on mobile food diaries and mobile health sensing systems,
emphasizing the importance of considering country differences in building and
deploying machine learning models to minimize biases and improve generalization
across different populations.

performance in synthesizing high-quality visual content, opening up the
opportunity to improve image super-resolution (SR) tasks. Recent solutions for
these tasks often train architecture-specific DGMs from scratch, or require
iterative fine-tuning and distillation on pre-trained DGMs, both of which take
considerable time and hardware investments. More seriously, since the DGMs are
established with a discrete pre-defined upsampling scale, they cannot well
match the emerging requirements of arbitrary-scale super-resolution (ASSR),
where a unified model adapts to arbitrary upsampling scales, instead of
preparing a series of distinct models for each case. These limitations beg an
intriguing question: can we identify the ASSR capability of existing
pre-trained DGMs without the need for distillation or fine-tuning? In this
paper, we take a step towards resolving this matter by proposing Diff-SR, a
first ASSR attempt based solely on pre-trained DGMs, without additional
training efforts. It is motivated by an exciting finding that a simple
methodology, which first injects a specific amount of noise into the
low-resolution images before invoking a DGM's backward diffusion process,
outperforms current leading solutions. The key insight is determining a
suitable amount of noise to inject, i.e., small amounts lead to poor low-level
fidelity, while over-large amounts degrade the high-level signature. Through a
finely-grained theoretical analysis, we propose the Perceptual Recoverable
Field (PRF), a metric that achieves the optimal trade-off between these two
factors. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness, flexibility, and
adaptability of Diff-SR, demonstrating superior performance to state-of-the-art
solutions under diverse ASSR environments.

Based on objective stress rates, the constitutive model accounts for finite

The theory generalises the standard linear solid model to three-dimensional
volume-preserving motions of large amplitude in a physically-consistent way.
The nonlinear equations governing shear motion take the form of a
one-dimensional hyperbolic system with relaxation. For specific objective rates
of Cauchy stress (lower- and upper-convected derivatives), we study the

very sensitive to variations of the stress relaxation time. Furthermore, the
existence of steady shocks is conditional. Extension of these results to the

sensitivity $\mathfrak S$ in remarkably general settings. However, guarantees
going beyond this general bound of $\mathfrak S d$ are known in perhaps only
one setting, for $\ell_2$ subspace embeddings, despite intense study of
sensitivity sampling in prior work. In this work, we show the first bounds for

our techniques yield further new results in the study of sampling algorithms,
showing that the root leverage score sampling algorithm achieves a bound of

multicellular spheroids, into more complex $3D$ shapes. These shape changes are
governed by mechanical forces including molecular motor-generated forces as
well as hydrostatic fluid pressure, both of which are actively regulated in
living matter through mechano-chemical feedback. Inspired by autonomous,
biophysical shape change, such as occurring in the model organism hydra, we
introduce a minimal, active, elastic model featuring a network of springs in a
globe-like spherical shell geometry. In this model there is coupling between
activity and the shape of the shell: if the local curvature of a filament
represented by a spring falls below a critical value, its elastic constant is
actively changed. This results in deformation of the springs that changes the
shape of the shell. By combining excitation of springs and pressure regulation,
we show that the shell undergoes a transition from spheroidal to either
elongated ellipsoidal or a different spheroidal shape, depending on pressure.
There exists a critical pressure at which there is an abrupt change from
ellipsoids to spheroids, showing that pressure is potentially a sensitive
switch for material shape. More complex shapes, involving loss of cylindrical
symmetry, can arise when springs are excited both above (spring constants
increase) and below (spring constants decrease) the curvature threshold. We
thus offer biologically inspired design principles for autonomous shape
transitions in active elastic shells.

table with the semantic type of the values contained in each column. Column
type annotation is a crucial pre-processing step for data search and
integration in the context of data lakes. State-of-the-art column type
annotation methods either rely on matching table columns to properties of a
knowledge graph or fine-tune pre-trained language models such as BERT for the
column type annotation task. In this work, we take a different approach and
explore using ChatGPT for column type annotation. We evaluate different prompt
designs in zero- and few-shot settings and experiment with providing task
definitions and detailed instructions to the model. We further implement a
two-step table annotation pipeline which first determines the class of the
entities described in the table and depending on this class asks ChatGPT to
annotate columns using only the relevant subset of the overall vocabulary.
Using instructions as well as the two-step pipeline, ChatGPT reaches F1 scores
of over 85% in zero- and one-shot setups. To reach a similar F1 score a RoBERTa
model needs to be fine-tuned with 300 examples. This comparison shows that
ChatGPT is able deliver competitive results for the column type annotation task

explore here if the kinetic exchange models of the market can ever capture such
features where a significant fraction of wealth can concentrate in the hands of
a countable few when the market size $N$ tends to infinity. One already
existing example of such a kinetic exchange model is the Chakraborti or
Yard-Sale model, where (in absence of tax redistribution etc) the entire wealth
condenses in the hand of one (for any $N$), and the market dynamics stops. With
tax redistribution etc, its steady state dynamics have been shown to have
remarkable applicability in many cases of our extremely unequal world. We show
here, another kinetic exchange model (called here the Banerjee model) has
intriguing intrinsic dynamics, by which only ten rich traders or agents possess
about 99.98\% of the total wealth in the steady state (without any tax etc like
external manipulation) for any large value of $N$. We will discuss in some
detail the statistical features of this model using Monte Carlo simulations. We
will also show, if the traders each have a non-vanishing probability $f$ of
following random exchanges, then these condensations of wealth (100\% in the
hand of one agent in the Chakraborti model, or about 99.98\% in the hands ten
agents in the Banerjee model) disappear in the large $N$ limit. We will also
see that due to the built-in possibility of random exchange dynamics in the
earlier proposed Goswami-Sen model, where the exchange probability decreases
with an inverse power of the wealth difference of the pair of traders, one did
not see any wealth condensation phenomena.

deviation of CFGs.To address the issue, we propose a novel approach that
leverages the error-tolerant and understanding ability of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate CFGs. Our approach involves a Chain of
Thought (CoT) with four steps: structure hierarchy extraction, nested code
block extraction, CFG generation of nested code blocks, and fusion of all
nested code blocks' CFGs. To address the limitations of the original CoT's
single-prompt approach (i.e., completing all steps in a single generative
pass), which can result in an ``epic'' prompt with hard-to-control behavior and
error accumulation, we break down the CoT into an AI chain with explicit
sub-steps. Each sub-step corresponds to a separate AI-unit, with an effective
prompt assigned to each unit for interacting with LLMs to accomplish a specific
purpose.Our experiments confirmed that our method outperforms existing CFG
tools in terms of node and edge coverage, especially for incomplete or

effectiveness of AI chain design principles: Hierarchical Task Breakdown, Unit

of the source post the second outburst pointing towards a gradual expansion of

of the disc due to the outburst. Our spectroscopic monitoring shows a dramatic
variation of the H$\alpha$ line as it transitioned from absorption feature to
the emission feature and back. Such transition can possibly be explained by the

to the lack of adequate software updates over recent years, the program has
become difficult to work with, sighting problems ranging from compatibility
issues with newer operating systems to maintenance issues from using a
generally unfamiliar programming language. This work presents DRAN, a new
software package for the reduction and analysis of HartRAO single-dish
continuum data. DRANs main functionality is based on LINES, however, it was
developed using Python and offers a variety of advanced features that include
automated data flagging, outlier detection, flux calibration, and time-series

project was to produce a standard user friendly software package for the
observatory that produces timeously calibrated data, drift scan images, and
supporting documentation for users of HartRAO continuum data.

author towards a target of interest. This task spans a variety of domains
ranging from social media opinion identification to detecting the stance for a
legal claim. However, the framing of the task varies within these domains, in
terms of the data collection protocol, the label dictionary and the number of
available annotations. Furthermore, these stance annotations are significantly
imbalanced on a per-topic and inter-topic basis. These make multi-domain stance
detection a challenging task, requiring standardization and domain adaptation.
To overcome this challenge, we propose $\textbf{T}$opic $\textbf{E}$fficient
$\textbf{St}$anc$\textbf{E}$ $\textbf{D}$etection (TESTED), consisting of a
topic-guided diversity sampling technique and a contrastive objective that is
used for fine-tuning a stance classifier. We evaluate the method on an existing
benchmark of $16$ datasets with in-domain, i.e. all topics seen and
out-of-domain, i.e. unseen topics, experiments. The results show that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art with an average of $3.5$ F1 points
increase in-domain, and is more generalizable with an averaged increase of
$10.2$ F1 on out-of-domain evaluation while using $\leq10\%$ of the training
data. We show that our sampling technique mitigates both inter- and per-topic
class imbalances. Finally, our analysis demonstrates that the contrastive
learning objective allows the model a more pronounced segmentation of samples
with varying labels.

the problem of $CO_2$ prediction, which is crucial for health monitoring but
can be used to monitor occupancy, which might reveal some private information.
We apply a number of transformations on a real dataset from a Smart Building to
simulate different SITA configurations on the collected data. We use the
transformed data with multiple Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyse the
performance of the models to predict $CO_{2}$ levels. Our results show that,
for different algorithms, different SITA configurations do not make one
algorithm perform better or worse than others, compared to the baseline data;
also, in our experiments, the temporal dimension was particularly sensitive,
with scores decreasing up to $18.9\%$ between the original and the transformed

privacy on the data utility of IoT applications, and can also help to identify
which parameters are more relevant for those systems so that higher privacy

Aggregate matter has a coherent weak charge leading to a repulsive interaction

memory. These channels model non-orthogonal communications scenarios, such as
the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scenario and underlay cognitive
communications, in which the interference from other communications signals is
much stronger than the thermal noise. Interference-limited communications is
expected to become a very common scenario in future wireless communications
systems, such as 5G, WiFi6, and beyond. As communications signals are
inherently cyclostationary in continuous time (CT), then after sampling at the
receiver, the discrete-time (DT) received signal model contains the sampled
desired information signal with additive sampled CT cyclostationary noise. The
sampled noise can be modeled as either a DT cyclostationary process or a DT
almost-cyclostationary process, where in the latter case the resulting channel
is not information-stable. In a previous work we characterized the capacity of
this model for the case in which the DT noise is memoryless. In the current
work we come closer to practical scenarios by modelling the resulting DT noise
as a finite-memory random process. The presence of memory requires the
development of a new set of tools for analyzing the capacity of channels with
additive non-stationary noise which has memory. Our results show, for the first
time, the relationship between memory, sampling frequency synchronization and
capacity, for interference-limited communications. The insights from our work
provide a link between the analog and the digital time domains, which has been
missing in most previous works on capacity analysis. Thus, our results can help
improving spectral efficiency and suggest optimal transceiver designs for
future communications paradigms.

stellar halo of the Galaxy is dominated by the debris of Gaia Enceladus/Sausage

accreted stars have been selected. We investigate these GES selections and
their effects on the inferred progenitor properties using data constructed from
APOGEE and Gaia. We explore selections made in eccentricity, energy-angular
momentum (E-Lz), radial action-angular momentum (Jr-Lz), action diamond, and
[Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] in the observations, selecting between 144 and 1,279 GES stars
with varying contamination from in-situ and other accreted stars. We also use
the Auriga cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to benchmark the different GES
dynamical selections. Applying the same observational GES cuts to nine Auriga
galaxies with a GES, we find that the Jr-Lz method is best for sample purity
and the eccentricity method for completeness. Given the average metallicity of
GES (-1.28 < [Fe/H] < -1.18), we use the $z=0$ mass-metallicity relationship to
find an average $\rm M_{\star}$ of $\sim 4 \times 10^{8}$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. We
adopt a similar procedure and derive $\rm M_{\star}$ for the GES-like systems
in Auriga and find that the eccentricity method overestimates the true $\rm
M_{\star}$ by $\sim2.6\times$ while E-Lz underestimates by $\sim0.7\times$.
Lastly, we estimate the total mass of GES to be $\rm 10^{10.5 -
11.1}~M_{\odot}$ using the relationship between the metallicity gradient and
the GES-to-in-situ energy ratio. In the end, we cannot just `pick and choose'
how we select GES stars, and instead should be motivated by the science
question.

varying degrees of fracture-to-fracture aperture/permeability heterogeneity and
network density to show how changes in these properties can cause the emergence
of anomalous flow and transport behavior. If fracture-to-fracture aperture
heterogeneity is increased in sparse networks, velocity fluctuations can
inhibit high flow rates and solute transport can be delayed, even in cases
where hydraulic aperture is monotonically increased. As the density of the
networks is increased, more connected pathways allow for particles to bypass
these effects. We discover transition behavior where with relatively few
connected pathways in a network from inflow to outflow boundaries, the first
arrival times of particles are not heavily affected by fracture-to-fracture
aperture heterogeneity, but the scaling behavior of the tails is strongly
influenced due to the particles being forced to sample some of the
heterogeneity in the velocity field caused by aperture differences. These
results reinforce the importance of considering multi-scale effects in
fractured systems and can inform flow and transport processes in both natural
and engineered fracture systems, especially the latter where high aperture
fractures are often stimulated and connect to existing fracture networks with
smaller apertures.

success of self-supervised representation learning such as contrastive learning
and masked language modeling, yet theoretical understanding of its role in
learning good representations remains limited. Recent work has built the
connection between self-supervised learning and approximating the top
eigenspace of a graph Laplacian operator. Learning a linear probe on top of
such features can naturally be connected to RKHS regression. In this work, we
use this insight to perform a statistical analysis of augmentation-based
pretraining. We start from the isometry property, a key geometric
characterization of the target function given by the augmentation. Our first
main theorem provides, for an arbitrary encoder, near tight bounds for both the
estimation error incurred by fitting the linear probe on top of the encoder,
and the approximation error entailed by the fitness of the RKHS the encoder
learns. Our second main theorem specifically addresses the case where the
encoder extracts the top-d eigenspace of a Monte-Carlo approximation of the
underlying kernel with the finite pretraining samples. Our analysis completely
disentangles the effects of the model and the augmentation. A key ingredient in
our analysis is the augmentation complexity, which we use to quantitatively
compare different augmentations and analyze their impact on downstream
performance on synthetic and real datasets.

To address this problem, in this paper we introduce a novel multi-modal FL

three modules: 1) multi-modal fusion (MF); 2) feature whitening (FW); and 3)
mutual information maximization (MIM). The MF module performs iterative model
averaging to learn without accessing data on clients in the case that clients
are associated with different data modalities. The FW module aligns the
representations learned among the different clients. The MIM module maximizes
the similarity of images from different modalities. Experimental results show
the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to iterative model
averaging, which is a widely used algorithm in FL. The code of the proposed

theories, where a computational advantage is achieved by consuming specific
forms of quantum resources and, conversely, resource-free computations are

be mapped to free-fermion dynamics, which can be simulated classically.
Supplementing these circuits with nonmatchgate operations or non-gaussian
fermionic states, respectively, makes them quantum universal. Can we similarly
identify quantum computational resources in the setting of more general
quasi-particle statistics, such as that of fermionic anyons? In this work, we
develop a resource-theoretic framework to define and investigate the
separability of fermionic anyons. We build the notion of separability through a
fractional Jordan-Wigner transformation, leading to a Schmidt decomposition for
fermionic-anyon states. We show that this notion of fermionic-anyon
separability, and the unitary operations that preserve it, can be mapped to the
free resources of matchgate circuits. We also identify how entanglement between
two qubits encoded in a dual-rail manner, as standard for matchgate circuits,
corresponds to the notion of entanglement between fermionic anyons. Though this
does not coincide with the usual definition of qubit entanglement, it provides
new insight into the limited capabilities of matchgate circuits.

problems are of great interest in many environmental problems and engineering
applications. To capture the complex physical processes involved in these
problems, a high grid resolution is usually needed. However, one does not need
or maybe cannot afford a fine grid of uniformly high resolution across the
whole domain. The need to resolve local fine features can be addressed by the
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method, which increases the grid resolution in
regions of interest as needed during the simulation while leaving general
estimates in other regions.
  In this work, we propose a block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (BSAMR)
framework to simulate two-phase flows using the level set (LS) function with
both the subcycling and non-subcycling methods on a collocated grid. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that unifies the subcycling
and non-subcycling methods to simulate two-phase flows. The use of the
collocated grid is also the first among the two-phase BSAMR framework, which
significantly simplifies the implementation of multi-level differential
operators and interpolation schemes. We design the synchronization operations,
including the averaging, refluxing, and synchronization projection, which
ensures that the flow field is divergence-free on the multi-level grid. It is
shown that the present multi-level scheme can accurately resolve the interfaces
of the two-phase flows with gravitational and surface tension effects while
having good momentum and energy conservation.

round-robin test results revealing that this visual grading is afflicted by

to the ISO 643 grain size assessment standard. This classification approach
facilitates the reliable, objective, and automated classification of

shorter than 2 days, while 19$\pm$4% have intermediate rotation periods of 2-20

transition from the rapidly to slowly rotating modes. We are unable to
determine rotation periods for six stars and suggest that some of the stars
without measured rotation periods may be viewed pole-on, as such stars are
absent from the distribution of inclinations we measure; this lack
notwithstanding, we recover the expected isotropic distribution of spin axes.

based on the principles of general relativity up to virialization. We have
chosen a spherical patch that starts to collapse gravitationally as it happens
in top-hat collapse. It is seen that although the dark matter sector collapses
the dark energy sector does keep a profile that is almost similar to the dark
energy profile for the background expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) universe for suitable model parameters. It is observed that in order to
formulate the problem in the general relativistic setting one has to abandon
the idea of a closed FLRW isolated collapsing patch. General relativity
requires an external generalized Vaidya spacetime to be matched with the
internal spherical patch whose dynamics is guided by the FLRW metric. It is
shown that almost all collapses are accompanied by some flux of matter and
radiation in the generalized Vaidya spacetime. Some of the spherical regions of
the universe are seen not to collapse but expand eternally, producing void-like
structures. Whether a spherical region will collapse or expand depends upon the
initial values of the system and other model parameters. As this work shows
that collapsing structures must emit some form of radiation, this may be taken
as an observational signature of our proposal.

may be seen as a probability density on $\mathbb{R}^3$, the value of the Lieb

multi-marginal optimal transport problem, which reads as a minimization problem
defined on the set of trace-class operators acting on the space of electronic
wavefunctions that are antisymmetric $L^2$ functions of $\mathbb{R}^{3N}$, with
partial trace equal to the prescribed electronic density. We introduce a
relaxation of this quantum optimal transport problem where the full partial

partial trace of the set of operators. We show that, under mild assumptions on
the electronic density, there exist sparse minimizers to the resulting moment
constrained approximation of the Lieb (MCAL) functional that read as operators
with rank at most equal to the number of moment constraints. We also prove
under appropriate assumptions on the set of moment functions that the value of

Spikformer architecture. To facilitate the search process, we propose methods
Evolutionary SNN neurons (ESNN), which optimizes the SNN parameters, and apply

the Vision Transformer (ViT) parameters. Moreover, we propose an accuracy and
energy balanced fitness function $\mathcal{F}_{AEB}$ that jointly considers
both energy consumption and accuracy, and aims to find a Pareto optimal

the study of cosmological structure. Starting from the theoretical power
spectrum defined in the 3D volume and obtained via the process of ensemble
averaging, we establish the construction of the observed 3D power spectrum,
folding the unequal-time information around the average position into the wave
modes along the line of sight. We show how these unequal-time cross-correlation
effects give rise to scale-dependent corrections in the observable 3D power
spectrum. We also introduce a new dimensionless observable, the
frequency-angular power spectrum, which is a function of dimensionless and
directly observable quantities corresponding to Fourier counterparts of angles
and redshifts. While inheriting many useful characteristics of the canonical
observed power spectrum, this newly introduced statistic does not depend on
physical distances and is hence free of so-called Alcock-Paczynski effects.
Such observable thus presents a clear advantage and simplification over the
traditional power spectrum. Moreover, relying on linear theory calculations, we
estimate that unequal-time corrections, while generally small, can amount to a
few percent on large scales and high redshifts. Interestingly, such corrections
depend on the bias of the tracers, the growth rate, but also their time
derivatives, opening up the possibility of new tests of cosmological models.
These radial mode effects also introduce anisotropies in the observed power
spectrum, in addition to the ones arising from redshift-space distortions,
generating non-vanishing odd multiples and imaginary contributions. Lastly, we
investigate the effects of unequal-time corrections in resumming long
displacements (IR-resummation) of the observed power spectrum.

operator network (DeepONet) framework, a novel class of neural networks
designed to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional spaces using
relatively small datasets. The proposed DeepONet takes an arbitrary continuous
rib geometry with control points as input and outputs continuous detailed
information about the distribution of pressure and heat transfer around the
profiled ribs. The datasets needed to train and test the proposed DeepONet
framework were obtained by simulating a 2D rib-roughened internal cooling
channel. To accomplish this, we continuously modified the input rib geometry by
adjusting the control points according to a simple random distribution with
constraints, rather than following a predefined path or sampling method. The
studied channel has a hydraulic diameter, Dh, of 66.7 mm, and a
length-to-hydraulic diameter ratio, L/Dh, of 10. The ratio of rib center height
to hydraulic diameter (e/Dh), which was not changed during the rib profile
update, was maintained at a constant value of 0.048. The ribs were placed in
the channel with a pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) of 10. In addition, we provide
the proposed surrogates with effective uncertainty quantification capabilities.
This is achieved by converting the DeepONet framework into a Bayesian DeepONet

rate of the optical light curve remains the same before and after the photon
flux jumps. This may be the signature of energy injection into the forward and
reverse shocked material at the front of the jet. In this study, we model the
Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) ejecta as a series of shells of material. We follow the
dynamical evolution of the ejecta as it interacts with itself (i.e., internal
shocks) and with the circumburst medium (i.e., external forward and reverse
shocks), and we calculate the emission from each shock event assuming
synchrotron emission. We confirm the viability of the model proposed by
\citet{2003Natur.426..138G} in which the jumps in the optical afterglow light
curve of GRB030329 are produced via refreshed shocks. The refreshed shocks may
be the signatures of the collisions between earlier ejected material with an
average Lorentz factor $\bar{\Gamma}\gtrsim 100$ and later ejected material
with $\bar{\Gamma} \sim 10$ once the early material has decelerated due to
interaction with the circumburst medium. We show that even if the late material
is ejected with a spread of Lorentz factors, internal shocks naturally produce
a narrow distribution of Lorentz factors ($\Delta\Gamma/\Gamma\lesssim0.1$),
which is a necessary condition to produce the observed quick rise times of the
jumps. These results imply a phase of internal shocks at some point in the
dynamical evolution of the ejecta, which requires a low magnetization in the

when exposed to specific trigger patterns, without affecting their performance
on normal samples. This type of attack is known as a backdoor attack. Recent
research has focused on designing invisible triggers for backdoor attacks to
ensure visual stealthiness. These triggers have demonstrated strong attack
performance even under backdoor defense, which aims to eliminate or suppress
the backdoor effect in the model. However, through experimental observations,
we have noticed that these carefully designed invisible triggers are often
susceptible to visual distortion during inference, such as Gaussian blurring or
environmental variations in real-world scenarios. This phenomenon significantly
undermines the effectiveness of attacks in practical applications.
Unfortunately, this issue has not received sufficient attention and has not
been thoroughly investigated. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
approach called the Visible, Semantic, Sample-Specific, and Compatible trigger
(VSSC-trigger), which leverages a recent powerful image method known as the
stable diffusion model. In this approach, a text trigger is utilized as a
prompt and combined with a benign image. The resulting combination is then
processed by a pre-trained stable diffusion model, generating a corresponding
semantic object. This object is seamlessly integrated with the original image,
resulting in a new realistic image, referred to as the poisoned image.
Extensive experimental results and analysis validate the effectiveness and
robustness of our proposed attack method, even in the presence of visual
distortion. We believe that the new trigger proposed in this work, along with
the proposed idea to address the aforementioned issues, will have significant
prospective implications for further advancements in this direction.

$2\times10^{14}$~1~MeV(Si)~Eqv.~n/cm$^2$, that will be integrated over a decade
of operation of the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Silicon
Photomultipliers exposed to this level of radiation have shown a strong
increase of dark count rate and radiation damage effects that also impact their
gain and photon detection efficiency. For this reason during operations the
whole detector is cooled down to about $-35$$^{\circ}$C. In this paper we
illustrate an innovative and cost-effective solution to mitigate the impact of
radiation damage on the timing performance of the detector, by integrating
small thermo-electric coolers (TECs) on the back of the SiPM package. This
additional feature, fully integrated as part of the SiPM array, enables a
further decrease in operating temperature down to about $-45^{\circ}$C. This
leads to a reduction by a factor of about two in the dark count rate without
requiring additional power budget, since the power required by the TEC is
almost entirely offset by a decrease in the power required for the SiPM
operation due to leakage current. In addition, the operation of the TECs with
reversed polarity during technical stops of the accelerator can raise the
temperature of the SiPMs up to 60$^{\circ}$C (about 50$^{\circ}$C higher than
the rest of the detector), thus accelerating the annealing of radiation damage
effects and partly recovering the SiPM performance.

deliberately removed in semantic parsing tasks, which generally assume that a
given surface form has only one correct logical form. We attempt to address
this shortcoming by introducing AmP, a framework, dataset, and challenge for
parsing with linguistic ambiguity. We define templates and generate data for
five well-documented linguistic ambiguities. Using AmP, we investigate how
several few-shot semantic parsing systems handle ambiguity, introducing three
new metrics. We find that large pre-trained models perform poorly at capturing
the distribution of possible meanings without deliberate instruction. However,
models are able to capture distribution well when ambiguity is attested in
their inputs. These results motivate a call for ambiguity to be explicitly
included in semantic parsing, and promotes considering the distribution of
possible outputs when evaluating semantic parsing systems.

and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It
constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood both as a framework

an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a
modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field.
In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively
modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic
quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or
anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. We compute the
explicit form of the aforementioned synthetic gauge fields in $\text{D}\le
3+1$. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases both in lattice

surface states, Bi2Se3 is widely regarded as a prototypical 3D topological
insulator. Further applications of the bulk material has, however, been
hindered by inherent structural defects that donate electrons and make the bulk
conductive. Consequently, controlling these defects is of great interest for
future technological applications, and while past literature has focused on
adding external doping elements to the mixture, a complete study on undoped
Bi2Se3 was still lacking. In this work, we use the self-flux method to obtain
high-quality Bi2Se3 single-crystals in the entire concentration range available
on the phase-diagram for the technique. By combining basic structural
characterization with measurements of the resistivity, Hall effect and
Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) quantum oscillations, the effects of these impurities
on the bulk transport are investigated in samples with electron densities
ranging from 10^17 cm^-3 to 10^19 cm^-3, from Se-rich to Bi-rich mixtures,
respectively, evidencing the transition into a degenerate semiconductor regime.
We find that electron-donor impurities, likely Se vacancies, unavoidably shift
the Fermi level up to 200 meV inside the conduction band. Other impurities,
like interstitial Bi and Se, are shown to play a significant role as scattering
centres, specially at low temperatures and in the decoherence of the SdH
oscillations. Previous open questions on Bi2Se3, such as the upturn in
resistivity below 30 K, the different scattering times in transport and quantum
oscillations, and the presence of additional low mobility bands, are addressed.
The results outlined here provide a concise picture on the bulk conducting

spectral analysis of the tumble kernel, we give explicit expressions for the
invariant measure in the general case. The non-equilibrium features exhibited
by the steady state includes positive mass for the jammed configurations and,
for the global-jamming class, exponential decay and growth terms, potentially

communities, such that lower levels of the hierarchy reveal finer-grained
community structures. There are two main classes of algorithms tackling this
problem. Divisive ($\textit{top-down}$) algorithms recursively partition the
nodes into two communities, until a stopping rule indicates that no further
split is needed. In contrast, agglomerative ($\textit{bottom-up}$) algorithms
first identify the smallest community structure and then repeatedly merge the
communities using a $\textit{linkage}$ method. In this article, we establish
theoretical guarantees for the recovery of the hierarchical tree and community
structure of a Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model by a bottom-up algorithm. We
also establish that this bottom-up algorithm attains the information-theoretic
threshold for exact recovery at intermediate levels of the hierarchy. Notably,
these recovery conditions are less restrictive compared to those existing for
top-down algorithms. This shows that bottom-up algorithms extend the feasible
region for achieving exact recovery at intermediate levels. Numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real data sets confirm the superiority of
bottom-up algorithms over top-down algorithms. We also observe that top-down
algorithms can produce dendrograms with inversions. These findings contribute
to a better understanding of hierarchical clustering techniques and their
applications in network analysis.

asynchronous data sequences. While RGB cameras capture every frame at a fixed
rate, event cameras only capture changes in the scene, resulting in sparse and
asynchronous data output. Despite the fact that event data carries useful
information that can be utilized in motion deblurring of RGB cameras,
integrating event and image information remains a challenge. Recent
state-of-the-art CNN-based deblurring solutions produce multiple 2-D event
frames based on the accumulation of event data over a time period. In most of
these techniques, however, the number of event frames is fixed and predefined,
which reduces temporal resolution drastically, particularly for scenarios when
fast-moving objects are present or when longer exposure times are required. It
is also important to note that recent modern cameras (e.g., cameras in mobile
phones) dynamically set the exposure time of the image, which presents an
additional problem for networks developed for a fixed number of event frames. A
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based event feature extraction module has been
developed for addressing these challenges, which enables us to use a
dynamically varying number of event frames. Using these modules, we constructed
a state-of-the-art deblurring network, Deformable Convolutions and LSTM-based

sequentially received one after another over time, and their distribution
assumptions may vary frequently. Although existing methods demonstrate the
effectiveness of their learning algorithms by providing a tight bound on either
dynamic regret or adaptive regret, most of them completely ignore learning with
model fairness, defined as the statistical parity across different
sub-population (e.g., race and gender). Another drawback is that when adapting
to a new environment, an online learner needs to update model parameters with a
global change, which is costly and inefficient. Inspired by the sparse
mechanism shift hypothesis, we claim that changing environments in online
learning can be attributed to partial changes in learned parameters that are
specific to environments and the rest remain invariant to changing
environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm under
the assumption that data collected at each time can be disentangled with two
representations, an environment-invariant semantic factor and an
environment-specific variation factor. The semantic factor is further used for
fair prediction under a group fairness constraint. To evaluate the sequence of
model parameters generated by the learner, a novel regret is proposed in which
it takes a mixed form of dynamic and static regret metrics followed by a
fairness-aware long-term constraint. The detailed analysis provides theoretical
guarantees for loss regret and violation of cumulative fairness constraints.
Empirical evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate our proposed method
sequentially outperforms baseline methods in model accuracy and fairness.

three epochs. We found $T_{\rm Moon}$ to be at $184.40\pm{2.65}\rm ~K$ and
$173.77\pm{2.48}\rm ~K$ using the first and the second methods, respectively,

weakly supervised labels from textual-established extractors are biased for
multimodal training. We present PV2TEA, an encoder-decoder architecture

the complex alloharmonic spectra depend on several integer numbers and bear a
unique imprint of the emission process, which the theory can decipher, avoiding

simulations of gravitational waves emitted by binary black hole mergers.
Further, we predict the presence of alloharmonics in the radio spectra of
pulsars and in optical frequency combs, and propose their use for measurement
of extremely small accelerations necessary for testing gravity theories. The

geometric optics. This connection is best understood through the propagation
properties of microlocal defect measures that appear as solutions to the wave

along the bicharacteristic flow. If one considers a merely
$\mathscr{C}^1$-metric this bicharacteristic flow may however not exist. The

integral curves of this continuous vector field) but uniqueness is lost. Here,
on a compact manifold without boundary, we consider this low regularity
setting, revisit the geometric control condition, and address the question of
support propagation for a measure solution to an ODE with continuous

Rastall gravity as a simple model with energy-momentum conservation violation

deviations as a set of \emph{transitions} that may be added to the original

  Using Mathematical Frameworks",,,,,"q-bio.QM math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When planktonic bacteria adhere together to a surface, they begin to form
biofilms, or communities of bacteria. Biofilm formation in a host can be
extremely problematic if left untreated, especially since antibiotics can be
ineffective in treating the bacteria. Certain lung diseases such as cystic
fibrosis can cause the formation of biofilms in the lungs and can be fatal.
With antibiotic-resistant bacteria, the use of phage therapy has been
introduced as an alternative or an additive to the use of antibiotics in order
to combat biofilm growth. Phage therapy utilizes phages, or viruses that attack
bacteria, in order to penetrate and eradicate biofilms. In order to evaluate
the effectiveness of phage therapy against biofilm bacteria, we adapt an
ordinary differential equation model to describe the dynamics of phage-biofilm
combat in the lungs. We then create our own phage-biofilm model with ordinary
differential equations and stochastic modeling. Then, simulations of parameter
alterations in both models are investigated to assess how they will affect the
efficiency of phage therapy against bacteria. By increasing the phage mortality
rate, the biofilm growth can be balanced and allow the biofilm to be more
vulnerable to antibiotics. Thus, phage therapy is an effective aid in biofilm
treatment.

representation space based on their past behaviors, got a surge of interest
from the industry for providing personalized services to users. Previous
efforts in user modeling mainly focus on learning a task-specific user
representation that is designed for a single task. However, since learning
task-specific user representations for every task is infeasible, recent studies
introduce the concept of universal user representation, which is a more
generalized representation of a user that is relevant to a variety of tasks.
Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches for learning universal user
representations are impractical in real-world applications due to the data
requirement, catastrophic forgetting and the limited learning capability for
continually added tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel continual user
representation learning method, called TERACON, whose learning capability is
not limited as the number of learned tasks increases while capturing the
relationship between the tasks. The main idea is to introduce an embedding for
each task, i.e., task embedding, which is utilized to generate task-specific
soft masks that not only allow the entire model parameters to be updated until
the end of training sequence, but also facilitate the relationship between the
tasks to be captured. Moreover, we introduce a novel knowledge retention module
with pseudo-labeling strategy that successfully alleviates the long-standing
problem of continual learning, i.e., catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments on public and proprietary real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority and practicality of TERACON. Our code is available at

evidence shows that a key dynamics lies in the tumor-environment interaction.
In particular, oxygen concentration plays a central role in the determination
of the phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer cell populations, whose qualitative
and geometric characteristics are predominant factors in the occurrence of
relapses and failure of eradication. We propose a mathematical model able to
describe the eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics of tumour cells in their
adaptation to hypoxic microenvironments. As a main novelty with respect to the
existing literature, we combine a phenotypic indicator reflecting the
experimentally-observed metabolic trade-off between the hypoxia-resistance
ability and the proliferative potential with a 2d geometric domain, without the
constraint of radial symmetry. The model is settled in the mathematical
framework of phenotype-structured population dynamics and it is formulated in
terms of systems of coupled non-linear integro-differential equations. The
computational outcomes demonstrate that hypoxia-induced selection results in a
geometric characterization of phenotypic-defined tumour niches that impact on
tumour aggressiveness and invasive ability. Furthermore, results show how the
knowledge of environmental characteristics provides a predictive advantage on
tumour mass development in terms of size, shape, and composition.

3D structures are essential in determining their functions. Accurately
predicting the conformation of protein side-chains given their backbones is
important for applications in protein structure prediction, design and
protein-protein interactions. Traditional methods are computationally intensive
and have limited accuracy, while existing machine learning methods treat the
problem as a regression task and overlook the restrictions imposed by the
constant covalent bond lengths and angles. In this work, we present DiffPack, a
torsional diffusion model that learns the joint distribution of side-chain
torsional angles, the only degrees of freedom in side-chain packing, by
diffusing and denoising on the torsional space. To avoid issues arising from
simultaneous perturbation of all four torsional angles, we propose
autoregressively generating the four torsional angles from \c{hi}1 to \c{hi}4
and training diffusion models for each torsional angle. We evaluate the method
on several benchmarks for protein side-chain packing and show that our method
achieves improvements of 11.9% and 13.5% in angle accuracy on CASP13 and
CASP14, respectively, with a significantly smaller model size (60x fewer
parameters). Additionally, we show the effectiveness of our method in enhancing
side-chain predictions in the AlphaFold2 model. Code will be available upon the

class of variational inequalities satisfying a classical error-bound condition.
Previously, linear convergence was only known to hold under strong
monotonicity. The error-bound condition is much weaker than strong monotonicity
and captures a larger class of problems, including bilinear saddle-point
problems such as those arising from two-player zero-sum Nash equilibrium
computation. We show that EG algorithms with SVRG-style variance reduction
(SVRG-EG) achieve linear convergence under the error-bound condition. In
addition, motivated by the empirical success of increasing iterate averaging
techniques in solving saddle-point problems, we also establish new convergence
results for variance-reduced EG with increasing iterate averaging. Finally, we
conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage of SVRG-EG, with and
without increasing iterate averaging, over deterministic EG.

additional assumptions on the parametric form of the distribution to derive
loss functions for predicting CTRs. In this work, we bring back the welfare
objectives of ad auctions into CTR predictions and propose a novel weighted

provides a provable guarantee on welfare but without assumptions on the eCPMs'

existing learning-to-rank methods. Further, we propose a theoretically

new challenges for model evaluation that the research community and industry

wide range of applications with a single, often referred to as

evaluation practices must take on a critical task to cope with the challenges
and responsibilities brought by this homogenization: providing valid
assessments for whether and how much human needs in downstream use cases can be
satisfied by the given model (\textit{socio-technical gap}). By drawing on
lessons from the social sciences, human-computer interaction (HCI), and the
interdisciplinary field of explainable AI (XAI), we urge the community to
develop evaluation methods based on real-world socio-requirements and embrace
diverse evaluation methods with an acknowledgment of trade-offs between realism
to socio-requirements and pragmatic costs. By mapping HCI and current NLG
evaluation methods, we identify opportunities for new evaluation methods for
LLMs to narrow the socio-technical gap and pose open questions.

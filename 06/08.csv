high-stakes applications like autonomous driving, concerns about social bias in
these systems are rising. Analysis of fairness in real-world vision systems,
such as object detection in driving scenes, has been limited to observing
predictive inequity across attributes such as pedestrian skin tone, and lacks a
consistent methodology to disentangle the role of confounding variables e.g.
does my model perform worse for a certain skin tone, or are such scenes in my
dataset more challenging due to occlusion and crowds? In this work, we
introduce ICON$^2$, a framework for robustly answering this question. ICON$^2$
leverages prior knowledge on the deficiencies of object detection systems to
identify performance discrepancies across sub-populations, compute correlations
between these potential confounders and a given sensitive attribute, and
control for the most likely confounders to obtain a more reliable estimate of
model bias. Using our approach, we conduct an in-depth study on the performance
of object detection with respect to income from the BDD100K driving dataset,
revealing useful insights.

Because it is difficult to propose an effective real-time operational system on

Especially crop production has to cope with a multitude of challenges in the
upcoming decades caused by a growing world population, climate change, the need
for sustainable production, lack of skilled workers, and generally the limited
availability of arable land. Vision systems could help cope with these
challenges by offering tools to make better and more sustainable field
management decisions and support the breeding of new varieties of crops by
allowing temporally dense and reproducible measurements. Recently, tackling
perception tasks in the agricultural domain got increasing interest in the
computer vision and robotics community since agricultural robotics are one
promising solution for coping with the lack of workers and enable a more
sustainable agricultural production at the same time. While large datasets and
benchmarks in other domains are readily available and have enabled significant
progress toward more reliable vision systems, agricultural datasets and
benchmarks are comparably rare. In this paper, we present a large dataset and
benchmarks for the semantic interpretation of images of real agricultural
fields. Our dataset recorded with a UAV provides high-quality, dense
annotations of crops and weeds, but also fine-grained labels of crop leaves at
the same time, which enable the development of novel algorithms for visual
perception in the agricultural domain. Together with the labeled data, we
provide novel benchmarks for evaluating different visual perception tasks on a
hidden test set comprised of different fields: known fields covered by the
training data and a completely unseen field. The tasks cover semantic
segmentation, panoptic segmentation of plants, leaf instance segmentation,
detection of plants and leaves, and hierarchical panoptic segmentation for

  Unveiled by the DAMPE","11 pages,9 figures and 1 table. Accepted for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent observations revealed that the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum
showed a complex structure: the hardening at $\rm \sim 200~GeV$ and softening
at $\rm \sim 10~TeV$. However, so far the physical origins of this spectral
feature remain strongly debated. In this work, we simulate the acceleration of
cosmic-ray protons in a nearby Supernova remnant (SNR) by solving numerically
the hydrodynamic equations and the equation for the quasi-isotropic CR momentum
distribution in the spherically symmetrical case to derive the spectrum of
protons injected into the interstellar medium (ISM), and then simulate the
propagation process of those accelerated CR particles to calculate the proton
fluxes reaching the Earth. Besides, we use the DRAGON numerical code to
calculate the large-scale cosmic-ray proton spectrum. Our simulated results are
in good agreement with the observed data (including the observed data of proton
fluxes and dipole anisotropy). We conclude that the spectral feature of
cosmic-ray protons in this energy band may originate from the superposition of
the distribution from the nearby SNR and background diffusive cosmic-ray
component. We find that the release of particles from this nearby SNR has a
time delay. Besides, it can be found that the nonlinear response of energetic
particles, release time of CR protons, and age of the local SNR can leave
strong signatures in the spectrum of the resulting CR proton fluxes.

superconducting (HTS) tapes are a significant challenge in HTS power
applications. This study employs two finite element analysis (FEA) models to
investigate the contributions from different AC loss components and provide
approaches for reducing AC losses in cables. An FEA model based on T-A formula
treats the cross-section of thin superconducting layers as 1D lines and,
therefore, only can predict the AC loss generated by the perpendicular magnetic
field. In contrast, the model based on H-formulation can be performed on the
actual 2D rectangular cross-section HTS tapes to provide the total AC losses
generated by magnetic fluxes penetrating from both the edges and surfaces of
HTS tapes, although this model requires more computing time and memory. Both 1D

understanding of the effects of cable design and operational parameters on the
AC loss components in a 2-layer CORC cable. The research results given in this

privacy, where a released index guarantees privacy for each vectors. Though
selection can be solved with an excellent utility guarantee in the central
model of differential privacy, the distributed setting lacks solutions.
Specifically, strong privacy guarantees with high utility are offered in high
trust settings, but not in low trust settings. For example, in the popular
shuffle model of distributed differential privacy, there are strong lower
bounds suggesting that the utility of the central model cannot be obtained. In
this paper we design a protocol for differentially private selection in a trust
setting similar to the shuffle model--with the crucial difference that our
protocol tolerates corrupted servers while maintaining privacy. Our protocol
uses techniques from secure multi-party computation (MPC) to implement a
protocol that: (i) has utility on par with the best mechanisms in the central
model, (ii) scales to large, distributed collections of high-dimensional
vectors, and (iii) uses $k\geq 3$ servers that collaborate to compute the
result, where the differential privacy holds assuming an honest majority. Since
general-purpose MPC techniques are not sufficiently scalable, we propose a
novel application of integer secret sharing, and evaluate the utility and
efficiency of our protocol theoretically and empirically. Our protocol is the
first to demonstrate that large-scale differentially private selection is

present a system architecture and the supporting theory, to enable
collaboration in a decentralized network of robots, where each robot relies on
different estimation algorithms. To develop our approach, we focus on
multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) with multi-target
tracking. Our theoretical framework builds on our idea of exploiting the
conditional independence structure inherent to many robotics applications to
separate between each robot's local inference (estimation) tasks and fuse only
relevant parts of their non-equal, but overlapping probability density function

Canadian Space Agency (CSA) contribution to the suite of four science
instruments of JWST. As one of the three NIRISS observing modes, the Single
Object Slitless Spectroscopy (SOSS) mode is tailor-made to undertake
time-series observations of exoplanets to perform transit spectroscopy. The
SOSS permits observing point sources between 0.6 and 2.8 um at a resolving
power of 650 at 1.25 um using a slit-less cross-dispersing grism while its
defocussing cylindrical lens enables observing targets as bright as J=6.7 by
spreading light across 23 pixels along the cross-dispersion axis. This paper
officially presents the design of the SOSS mode, its operation,
characterization, and its performance, from ground-based testing and
flight-based Commissioning. On-sky measurements demonstrate a peak photon
conversion efficiency of 55% at 1.2 um. The first time-series on the A-type
star BD+60o1753 achieves a flux stability close to the photon-noise limit, so
far tested to a level of 20 parts per million on 40-minute time-scales after
simply subtracting a long-term trend. Uncorrected 1/f noise residuals
underneath the spectral traces add an extra source of noise equivalent to
doubling the readout noise. Preliminary analysis of a HAT-P-14b transit
time-series indicates that it is difficult to remove all the noise in pixels
with partially saturated ramps. Overall, the SOSS delivers performance at the
level required to tackle key exoplanet science programs such as detecting
secondary atmospheres on terrestrial planets and measuring abundances of
several chemical species in gas giants.

computed as truncated hashes of each party's view of the channel keys, encoded

to detect any inconsistencies. Previous work has extensively studied the
usability of various verification strategies and encoding formats, however, the
exact effect of key fingerprint length on the security and usability of key
fingerprint verification has not been rigorously investigated. We present a
162-participant study on the effect of numeric key fingerprint length on
comparison time and error rate. While the results confirm some widely-held
intuitions such as general comparison times and errors increasing significantly
with length, a closer look reveals interesting nuances. The significant rise in
comparison time only occurs when highly similar fingerprints are compared, and
comparison time remains relatively constant otherwise. On errors, our results
clearly distinguish between security non-critical errors that remain low
irrespective of length and security critical errors that significantly rise,
especially at higher fingerprint lengths. A noteworthy implication of this

high-quality labeled data for the learning, while the data labeling is costly.
We address this issue and propose an efficient data annotation pipeline for

non-learning-based bone extraction (BE) and acetabulum and femoral head
segmentation (AFS) and active-learning-based annotation refinement (AAR). For
BE we use the classic graph-cut algorithm. For AFS we propose an improved
algorithm, including femoral head boundary localization using first-order and
second-order gradient regularization, line-based non-maximum suppression, and
anatomy prior-based femoral head extraction. For AAR, we refine the
algorithm-produced pseudo labels with the help of trained deep models: we
measure the uncertainty based on the disagreement between the original pseudo
labels and the deep model predictions, and then find out the samples with the
largest uncertainty to ask for manual labeling. Using the proposed pipeline, we
construct a large-scale bone structure analyses dataset from more than 300
clinical and diverse CT scans. We perform careful manual labeling for the test
set of our data. We then benchmark multiple state-of-the art deep
learning-based methods of medical image segmentation using the training and

modern informatics. Classical transmissions are recognized to be vulnerable to
quantum computer attacks. Remarkably, the same quantum mechanics that engenders
quantum computers offer guaranteed protection against these attacks via a
quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. Yet, long-distance transmission is
problematic since the signal decay in optical channels occurs at distances of
about a hundred kilometers. We resolve this problem by creating a QKD protocol,
further referred to as the Terra Quantum QKD protocol (TQ-QKD protocol), using
semiclassical pulses containing enough photons for random bit encoding and
exploiting erbium amplifiers to retranslate photon pulses and, at the same
time, ensuring that at this intensity only a few photons could go outside the
channel even at distances about hundred meters. As a result, an eavesdropper
will not be able to efficiently utilize the lost part of the signal. A central
TQ-QKD protocol's component is the end-to-end control over losses in the
transmission channel which, in principle, could allow an eavesdropper to obtain
the transmitted information. However, our control precision is such that if the
degree of the leak falls below the control border, then the leaking states are
quantum since they contain only a few photons. Therefore, available to an
eavesdropper parts of the bit encoding states representing `0' and `1' are
nearly indistinguishable. Our work presents the experimental realization of the
TQ-QKD protocol ensuring secure communication over 1032 kilometers. Moreover,
further refining the quality of the scheme's components will greatly expand the
attainable transmission distances. This paves the way for creating a secure
global QKD network in the upcoming years.

and data. We focus on fundamental phenomena that are modelled by partial
differential equations, such as linear convection, Burgers equation, and
two-dimensional turbulence. First, we formulate the problem, describe the
physics-constrained convolutional neural network, and parameterise the
systematic error. Second, we uncover the solutions from data corrupted by large
multimodal systematic errors. Third, we perform a parametric study for
different systematic errors. We show that the method is robust. Fourth, we
analyse the physical properties of the uncovered solutions. We show that the
solutions inferred from the PC-CNN are physical, in contrast to the data
corrupted by systematic errors that does not fulfil the governing equations.
This work opens opportunities for removing epistemic errors from models, and

with a new scheme utilised for the cleaning, based on the coupling of dipolar
excitation with Ramsey's method of time-separated oscillatory fields and the

determined to be 2536.83(45) keV, which is $\sim$4 times more precise and
11.4(20) keV ($\sim$ 6$\sigma$) smaller than the adopted value in the most
recent Atomic Mass Evaluation AME2020. The daughter, $^{136}$Ba, has a 4$^+$

address this, we propose a random utility maximization (RUM) based model that
considers each subset of choice alternatives as a composite alternative, where
individuals choose a subset according to the RUM framework. While this approach
offers a natural and intuitive modeling approach for multiple-choice analysis,
the large number of subsets of choices in the formulation makes its estimation

acyclic graph (DAG) based representations of choices where each node of the DAG
is associated with an elemental alternative and additional information such
that the number of selected elemental alternatives. Our innovation is to show
that the multi-choice model is equivalent to a recursive route choice model on
the DAG, leading to the development of new efficient estimation algorithms
based on dynamic programming. In addition, the DAG representations enable us to
bring some advanced route choice models to capture the correlation between
subset choice alternatives. Numerical experiments based on synthetic and real
datasets show many advantages of our modeling approach and the proposed

assess semantic abilities of LLMs using two-word phrases using a task that can
be performed relatively easily by humans without advanced training. Combining
multiple words into a single concept is a fundamental aspect of human language
and intelligence. The test requires meaningfulness judgments of 1768 noun-noun
combinations that have been rated as meaningful (e.g., baby boy) or not
meaningful (e.g., goat sky). by 150 human raters. We provide versions of the
task that probe meaningfulness ratings on a 0-4 scale as well as binary
judgments. We conducted a series of experiments using the TWT on GPT-4,
GPT-3.5, and Bard, with both versions. Results demonstrated that, compared to
humans, all models perform poorly at rating meaningfulness of these phrases.
GPT-3.5 and Bard are also unable to make binary discriminations between
sensible and nonsense phrases as making sense. GPT-4 makes a substantial
improvement in binary discrimination of combinatorial phrases but is still
significantly worse than human performance. The TWT can be used to understand
the limitations and weaknesses of current LLMs, and potentially improve them.

strength than quartz, has a lower breakdown threshold. This implies carrier
generation in hBN is much more efficient. Furthermore, we demonstrate the clean
removal of hBN without damage to the surrounding hBN film or the substrate,

cleaner mask estimates and semantic features. Second, we perform
diffusion-guided 3D optimization to estimate shape and texture that are of
high-fidelity and faithful to input images. We also propose a novel technique
to calculate more stable image-level gradients via diffusion models compared to
existing alternatives. Finally, we produce realistic animations by fine-tuning
the rendered shape and texture under rigid part transformations. Extensive
evaluations on multiple existing datasets as well as newly introduced noisy web
image collections with occlusions and truncation demonstrate that ARTIC3D

  Semi-Supervised Learning","Under review, 12 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Addressing the class imbalance in long-tailed semi-supervised learning (SSL)
poses a few significant challenges stemming from differences between the
marginal distributions of unlabeled data and the labeled data, as the former is
often unknown and potentially distinct from the latter. The first challenge is
to avoid biasing the pseudo-labels towards an incorrect distribution, such as
that of the labeled data or a balanced distribution, during training. However,
we still wish to ensure a balanced unlabeled distribution during inference,
which is the second challenge. To address both of these challenges, we propose
a three-faceted solution: a flexible distribution alignment that progressively
aligns the classifier from a dynamically estimated unlabeled prior towards a
balanced distribution, a soft consistency regularization that exploits
underconfident pseudo-labels discarded by threshold-based methods, and a schema
for expanding the unlabeled set with input data from the labeled partition.
This last facet comes in as a response to the commonly-overlooked fact that
disjoint partitions of labeled and unlabeled data prevent the benefits of
strong data augmentation on the labeled set. Our overall framework requires no
additional training cycles, so it will align, distill, and augment everything
all at once (ADALLO). Our extensive evaluations of ADALLO on imbalanced SSL
benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and STL10-LT with
varying degrees of class imbalance, amount of labeled data, and distribution
mismatch, demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of imbalanced
SSL under large distribution mismatch, as well as competitiveness with
state-of-the-art methods when the labeled and unlabeled data follow the same

centroid-reconstruction loss, is minimized in the ambient space. We derive a
closed-form solution using an eigendecomposition of a symmetric matrix. We did
a detailed analysis and presented some crucial mathematical properties of the

solving the optimization problem using a descent method. We establish a

rebuild the corresponding class centroid. Therefore the proposed method can be
considered a form of supervised PCA. Experimental results show the performance

the \textit{Ccce} system becomes the most stable. By probing the
volume-dependent free energies at 19 GPa, we see that \textit{Ccce} is always
the most stable phase between the two structures and also throughout the

conclude that the \textit{Ccce} system becomes dynamically stable only around
19-20 GPa, and that the \textit{Cmc2$_1$} phase, is metastable up to 30 GPa.

Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised

by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate

indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order
of $0.1 \, \mathrm{pMpc} \lesssim R_\text{ion} \lesssim 1 \, \mathrm{pMpc}$ in
a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully
neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with
large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at $z \sim 5.8$-$5.9$ and $z

stir in the world of image generation and editing. Unlike traditional methods
that learn a diffusion model in pixel space, StableDiffusion learns a diffusion
model in the latent space via a VQGAN, ensuring both efficiency and quality. It
not only supports image generation tasks, but also enables image editing for
real images, such as image inpainting and local editing. However, we have
observed that the vanilla VQGAN used in StableDiffusion leads to significant
information loss, causing distortion artifacts even in non-edited image
regions. To this end, we propose a new asymmetric VQGAN with two simple
designs. Firstly, in addition to the input from the encoder, the decoder
contains a conditional branch that incorporates information from task-specific
priors, such as the unmasked image region in inpainting. Secondly, the decoder
is much heavier than the encoder, allowing for more detailed recovery while
only slightly increasing the total inference cost. The training cost of our
asymmetric VQGAN is cheap, and we only need to retrain a new asymmetric decoder
while keeping the vanilla VQGAN encoder and StableDiffusion unchanged. Our
asymmetric VQGAN can be widely used in StableDiffusion-based inpainting and
local editing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can
significantly improve the inpainting and editing performance, while maintaining
the original text-to-image capability. The code is available at

Generative Prior-guided UNsupervised Image-to-image Translation (GP-UNIT), that
improves the quality, applicability and controllability of the existing

from pre-trained class-conditional GANs to build coarse-level cross-domain
correspondences, and to apply the learned prior to adversarial translations to
excavate fine-level correspondences. With the learned multi-level content
correspondences, GP-UNIT is able to perform valid translations between both
close domains and distant domains. For close domains, GP-UNIT can be
conditioned on a parameter to determine the intensity of the content
correspondences during translation, allowing users to balance between content
and style consistency. For distant domains, semi-supervised learning is
explored to guide GP-UNIT to discover accurate semantic correspondences that
are hard to learn solely from the appearance. We validate the superiority of
GP-UNIT over state-of-the-art translation models in robust, high-quality and

demonstrated remarkable \emph{in-context learning} (ICL) abilities, where they
can perform new tasks when prompted with training and test examples, without
any parameter update to the model. This work first provides a comprehensive
statistical theory for transformers to perform ICL. Concretely, we show that
transformers can implement a broad class of standard machine learning
algorithms in context, such as least squares, ridge regression, Lasso, learning
generalized linear models, and gradient descent on two-layer neural networks,
with near-optimal predictive power on various in-context data distributions.
Using an efficient implementation of in-context gradient descent as the
underlying mechanism, our transformer constructions admit mild size bounds, and
can be learned with polynomially many pretraining sequences.
  Building on these ``base'' ICL algorithms, intriguingly, we show that
transformers can implement more complex ICL procedures involving
\emph{in-context algorithm selection}, akin to what a statistician can do in
real life -- A \emph{single} transformer can adaptively select different base
ICL algorithms -- or even perform qualitatively different tasks -- on different
input sequences, without any explicit prompting of the right algorithm or task.
We both establish this in theory by explicit constructions, and also observe
this phenomenon experimentally. In theory, we construct two general mechanisms
for algorithm selection with concrete examples: pre-ICL testing, and post-ICL
validation. As an example, we use the post-ICL validation mechanism to
construct a transformer that can perform nearly Bayes-optimal ICL on a
challenging task -- noisy linear models with mixed noise levels.
Experimentally, we demonstrate the strong in-context algorithm selection
capabilities of standard transformer architectures.

lopsidedness in a sample of 1435 disk-like galaxies selected from the TNG50
simulation. We find that the percentage of lopsided galaxies (10%-30%) is in
good agreement with observations if we use similar radial ranges to the

extend our measurement to larger radii. We find a mild or lack of correlation
between lopsidedness amplitude and environment at z=0 and a strong correlation
between lopsidedness and galaxy morphology regardless of the environment.
Present-day galaxies with more extended disks, flatter inner galactic regions
and lower central stellar mass density (i.e. late-type disk galaxies) are
typically more lopsided than galaxies with smaller disks, rounder inner
galactic regions and higher central stellar mass density (i.e. early-type disk
galaxies). Interestingly, we find that lopsided galaxies have, on average, a
very distinct star formation history within the last 10 Gyr, with respect to
their symmetric counterparts. Symmetric galaxies have typically assembled at
early times (~8-6 Gyr ago) with relatively short and intense bursts of central
star formation, while lopsided galaxies have assembled on longer timescales and
with milder initial bursts of star formation, continuing building up their mass
until z=0. Overall, these results indicate that lopsidedness in present-day

models are expensive to train and deploy, and it is also difficult to expand
their knowledge beyond pre-training data without forgetting previous knowledge.
This paper proposes a new neural network architecture, ModuleFormer, that
leverages modularity to improve the efficiency and flexibility of large
language models. ModuleFormer is based on the Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE).
Unlike the previous SMoE-based modular language model [Gururangan et al.,
2021], which requires domain-labeled data to learn domain-specific experts,
ModuleFormer can induce modularity from uncurated data with its new load
balancing and load concentration losses. ModuleFormer is a modular architecture
that includes two different types of modules, new stick-breaking attention
heads, and feedforward experts. Different modules are sparsely activated
conditions on the input token during training and inference. In our experiment,
we found that the modular architecture enables three important abilities for
large pre-trained language models: 1) Efficiency, since ModuleFormer only
activates a subset of its modules for each input token, thus it could achieve
the same performance as dense LLMs with more than two times throughput; 2)
Extendability, ModuleFormer is more immune to catastrophic forgetting than
dense LLMs and can be easily extended with new modules to learn new knowledge
that is not included in the training data; 3) Specialisation, finetuning
ModuleFormer could specialize a subset of modules to the finetuning task, and
the task-unrelated modules could be easily pruned for a lightweight deployment.

has delighted researchers to explore their utilization in computer vision
tasks. Like other computer vision tasks, DEtection TRansformer (DETR)
introduces transformers for object detection tasks by considering the detection
as a set prediction problem without needing proposal generation and
post-processing steps. It is a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method for object
detection, particularly in scenarios where the number of objects in an image is
relatively small. Despite the success of DETR, it suffers from slow training
convergence and performance drops for small objects. Therefore, many
improvements are proposed to address these issues, leading to immense
refinement in DETR. Since 2020, transformer-based object detection has
attracted increasing interest and demonstrated impressive performance. Although
numerous surveys have been conducted on transformers in vision in general, a
review regarding advancements made in 2D object detection using transformers is
still missing. This paper gives a detailed review of twenty-one papers about
recent developments in DETR. We begin with the basic modules of Transformers,
such as self-attention, object queries and input features encoding. Then, we
cover the latest advancements in DETR, including backbone modification, query
design and attention refinement. We also compare all detection transformers in
terms of performance and network design. We hope this study will increase the
researcher's interest in solving existing challenges towards applying
transformers in the object detection domain. Researchers can follow newer

is, we let the Higgs be a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) boson of a global coset
symmetry $G/H$ that spontaneously breaks at an energy scale $\sim 4\pi f$ and
give it a suitable $SU(2) \subset G$ Chern-Simons interaction, with $\beta$ the
dimensionless Chern-Simons coupling strength and $f$ an $SU(2)$ decay constant.
As a result, slow-roll inflation occurs via $SU(2)$-induced friction down a
steep sinusoidal potential. In order to obey electroweak $SU(2)_{\rm L}\times
U(1)_Y$ symmetry, the lowest-order Chern-Simons interaction is required to be
quadratic in the Higgs with coupling strength $\propto \beta^2/f^2$.
Higher-order interaction terms keep the full Lagrangian nearly invariant under
the approximate pNG shift symmetry. Employing the simplest symmetry coset
$SU(5)/SO(5)$, $N$ $e$-folds of inflation occur when $N \approx 60
\left(g/0.64\right)^2\left[\beta/\left(3\times
10^6\right)\right]^{8/3}\left[f/\left(5\times 10^{11}\ {\rm

Small values of the decay constant, $f \lesssim 5 \times 10^{11} {\rm GeV}$,
which are needed to address the Higgs hierarchy problem, are ruled out by
electric dipole measurements and so successfully explaining inflation requires
large $\beta$. We discuss possible methods to achieve such large couplings and
other alternative Higgs inflation scenarios outside the standard
modified-gravity framework.

gauge-invariant operators. In this paper we continue the study of double copy
for form factors. First, we generalize the double-copy prescription to form
factors of higher-length operators ${\rm tr}(\phi^m)$ with $m\geq3$. These
higher-length operators introduce new non-trivial color identities, but the
double-copy prescription works perfectly well. The closed formulae for the
CK-dual numerators are also provided. Next, we discuss the $\vec{v}$ vectors
which are central ingredients appearing in the factorization relations of both
the KLT kernels and the gauge form factors. We present a general construction

we consider the double copy for the form factor of the ${\rm tr}(F^2)$ operator
in pure Yang-Mills theory. In this case, we propose a new prescription that
involves a gauge invariant decomposition for the form factor and a combination
of different CK-dual numerators appearing in the expansion.

that such models can change the kinematics and structure of dwarf galaxies

uncertainties such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, halo occupation

them. This work thus opens a window to probe both dwarf galaxy formation models

SOSS instrument mode, with a wavelength coverage of 0.6 - 2.8 {\mu}m and R ~
700. Using a custom-built pipeline, JExoRes, we investigate key diagnostics of
NIRISS SOSS with observations of two giant exoplanets, WASP-39 b and WASP-96 b,
as case studies. We conduct a detailed evaluation of the different aspects of
the data reduction and analysis, including sources of contamination, 1/f noise,
and system properties such as limb darkening. The slitless nature of NIRISS
SOSS makes it susceptible to contamination due to background sources. We
present a method to model and correct for dispersed field stars which can
significantly improve the accuracy of the observed spectra. In doing so, we
also report an empirically determined throughput function for the instrument.
We find significant correlated noise in the derived spectra, which may be
attributed to 1/f noise, and discuss its implications for spectral binning. We
quantify the covariance matrix which would enable the consideration of
correlated noise in atmospheric retrievals. Finally, we conduct a comparative

on a volume-limited ($<50$ Mpc) sample of 26 hard X-ray ($>10$ keV) selected
radio-quiet AGN. We find an extremely high detection rate (25/26 or
$94^{+3}_{-6}\%$), which shows that nuclear emission at mm-wavelenghts is
nearly ubiquitous in accreting SMBHs. Our high-resolution observations show a
tight correlation between the nuclear (1-23 pc) 100GHz and the intrinsic X-ray
emission (1$\sigma$ scatter of $0.22$ dex). The ratio between the 100GHz
continuum and the X-ray emission does not show any correlation with column
density, black hole mass, Eddington ratio or star formation rate, which
suggests that the 100GHz emission can be used as a proxy of SMBH accretion over
a very broad range of these parameters. The strong correlation between 100GHz

density based on the ratio between the observed 2-10keV ($F^{\rm

gained widespread recognition in the astrophysical community as a reliable tool
to simulate space plasmas, implicit methods have been seldom explored. This is
partly due to the lack of a reliable relativistic implicit PIC formulation that
is applicable to state-of-the-art simulations. We propose the RelSIM to fill

iterations and only requiring a global linear solve of the field equations.
With a set of standardized one- and two-dimensional tests, we demonstrate that
the RelSIM produces more accurate results with much smaller numerical errors in
the total energy than standard explicit PIC, particularly when characteristic
plasma scales (skin depth and plasma frequency) are heavily underresolved on

$\alpha$-abundances in the M31 disk. The Milky Way has two chemically-defined
disks, the low-$\alpha$ and high-$\alpha$ disks, which are closely related to
the thin and thick disks, respectively. The origin of the two populations and
the $\alpha$-bimodality between them is not entirely clear, although there are
now several models that can reproduce the observed features. To help constrain
the models and discern the origin, we have undertaken a study of the chemical
abundances of the M31 disk using JWST NIRSpec, in order to determine whether
stars in M31's disk also show an $\alpha$-abundance bimodality. Approximately
100 stars were observed in our single NIRSpec field at a projected distance of
18 kpc from the M31 center. The 1-D extracted spectra have an average
signal-to-noise ratio of 85 leading to statistical metallicity precision of
0.016 dex, $\alpha$-abundance precision of 0.012 dex, and a radial velocity
precision 8 km/s. The initial results indicate that, in contrast to the Milky
Way, there is no $\alpha$-bimodality in the M31 disk, and no low-$\alpha$
sequence. The entire stellar population falls along a single chemical sequence
very similar to the MW's high-alpha component which had a high star formation
rate. While this is somewhat unexpected, the result is not that surprising
based on other studies that found the M31 disk has a larger velocity dispersion
than the MW and is dominated by a thick component. M31 has had a more active
accretion and merger history than the MW which might explain the chemical
differences.

samples and models the field-level likelihood of two-dimensional cosmological
data such as weak lensing. Multiscale Flow uses hierarchical decomposition of
cosmological fields via a wavelet basis, and then models different wavelet
components separately as Normalizing Flows. The log-likelihood of the original
cosmological field can be recovered by summing over the log-likelihood of each
wavelet term. This decomposition allows us to separate the information from
different scales and identify distribution shifts in the data such as unknown
scale-dependent systematics. The resulting likelihood analysis can not only
identify these types of systematics, but can also be made optimal, in the sense
that the Multiscale Flow can learn the full likelihood at the field without any
dimensionality reduction. We apply Multiscale Flow to weak lensing mock
datasets for cosmological inference, and show that it significantly outperforms
traditional summary statistics such as power spectrum and peak counts, as well
as novel Machine Learning based summary statistics such as scattering transform
and convolutional neural networks. We further show that Multiscale Flow is able
to identify distribution shifts not in the training data such as baryonic
effects. Finally, we demonstrate that Multiscale Flow can be used to generate
realistic samples of weak lensing data.

separation of $\sim 10\deg$ from the center of the Small Magellanic Cloud

kpc given the system's observed distance ($D_{\odot} = 80$ kpc). This also
places the system $\sim 35$ kpc from the center of the Large Magellanic Cloud

halo. We tentatively measure the proper motion of DELVE 6 using data from
$\textit{Gaia}$, which we find supports a potential association between the

necessary to determine its origins, we highlight that DELVE 6 may represent
only the second or third ancient ($\tau > 9$ Gyr) star cluster associated with

(WD) accreting matter from a companion star. Observations of CVs provide an
opportunity to learn about accretion disks, the physics of compact objects,
classical novae, and the evolution of the binary and the WD that may ultimately
end in a type Ia supernova (SN). As type Ia SNe involve a WD reaching the
Chandrasekhar limit or merging WDs, WD mass measurements are particularly
important for elucidating the path from CV to type Ia SN. For intermediate
polar (IP) type CVs, the WD mass is related to the bremsstrahlung temperature
of material in the accretion column, which typically peaks at X-ray energies.
Thus, the IPs with the strongest hard X-ray emission, such as those discovered
by the INTEGRAL satellite, are expected to have the highest masses. Here, we
report on XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and optical observations of IGR J15038-6021. We
find an X-ray periodicity of 1678+/-2s, which we interpret as the WD spin
period. From fitting the 0.3-79 keV spectrum with a model that uses the
relationship between the WD mass and the post-shock temperature, we measure a
WD mass of 1.36+0.04-0.11 Msun. This follows an earlier study of IGR
J14091-6108, which also has a WD with a mass approaching the Chandrasekhar

WDs and discuss the results in the context of WD mass studies as well as the
implications for WD mass evolution.

redshift 2. The energy in the field is slightly reduced as the system
approaches redshift zero in agreement with adiabatic decompression. The field
structure is highly turbulent in the center and shows field reversals on a
length scale of a few 10 kpc and an anti-correlation between the radial and

idealistic modelling, through the hypotheses of spherical symmetry and
hydrostatic equilibrium, are more and more being questioned. Along these lines,
the soft X-ray emission detected in tens of clusters with ROSAT was found to be
higher than what expected from the idealistic hot gas modelling, pointing to
our incomplete understanding of these objects. Aims. Given that cluster
environments are at the interface between the hot intra-cluster medium (ICM),
warm circum-galactic medium (WCGM) and warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), we
aim to explore the relative soft X-ray emission of different gas phases in
circum-cluster environments. Method. By using the most massive halos in
IllustrisTNG at z=0, we have predicted the hydrodynamical properties of the gas
from cluster centers to their outskirts (5 R200), and modelled their X-ray
radiation for various plasma phases. Results. First, we found that the radial
profile of temperature, density, metallicity and clumpiness of the ICM are in
good agreement with recent X-ray observations of clusters. Secondly, we have
developed a method to predict the radial profile of soft X-ray emission in
different bands, the column density of ions and the X-ray absorption lines (O
VIII, O VII, Ne IX, and Ne IX) of warm-hot gas inside and around clusters.
Conclusion. The warm gas (in the form of both WCGM and WHIM gas) is a strong
emitter in soft X-ray bands, and is qualitatively consistent with the
observational measurements. Our results suggest that the cluster soft excess is
induced by the thermal emission of warm gas in the circum-cluster environments.

to understanding their evolution and end fate. An observational signature of
pre-SN mass loss is the detection of an early, short-lived peak prior to the
radioactive-powered peak in the lightcurve of the SN. This is usually
attributed to the SN shock passing through an extended envelope or
circumstellar medium (CSM). Such an early peak is common for double-peaked Type
IIb SNe with an extended Hydrogen envelope but is uncommon for normal Type Ibc
SNe with very compact progenitors. In this paper, we systematically study a
sample of 14 double-peaked Type Ibc SNe out of 475 Type Ibc SNe detected by the
Zwicky Transient Facility. The rate of these events is ~ 3-9 % of Type Ibc SNe.
A strong correlation is seen between the peak brightness of the first and the
second peak. We perform a holistic analysis of this sample's photometric and
spectroscopic properties. We find that six SNe have ejecta mass less than 1.5
Msun. Based on the nebular spectra and lightcurve properties, we estimate that
the progenitor masses for these are less than ~ 12 Msun. The rest have an
ejecta mass > 2.4 Msun and a higher progenitor mass. This sample suggests that
the SNe with low progenitor masses undergo late-time binary mass transfer.
Meanwhile, the SNe with higher progenitor masses are consistent with
wave-driven mass loss or pulsation-pair instability-driven mass loss
simulations.

provide a simple solution that empowers LCMs to improve dietary pattern
estimation. We develop a tree-regularized Bayesian LCM that shares statistical
strength between dietary patterns to make better estimates using limited data.
This is achieved via a Dirichlet diffusion tree process that specifies a prior
distribution for the unknown tree over classes. Dietary patterns that share
proximity to one another in the tree are shrunk towards ancestral dietary
patterns a priori, with the degree of shrinkage varying across pre-specified
food groups. Using dietary intake data from the Hispanic Community Health

introduced in [15] for solving the time-dependent radiation transport equation
(RTE). The method relies on a splitting of the kinetic distribution function
for the radiation into uncollided and collided components. A high-resolution
method (in angle) is used to approximate the uncollided components and a
low-resolution method is used to approximate the the collided component. After
each time step, the kinetic distribution is reinitialized to be entirely
uncollided. For this analysis, we consider a mono-energetic problem on a
periodic domains, with constant material cross-sections of arbitrary size. To
focus the analysis, we assume the uncollided equation is solved exactly and the
collided part is approximated in angle via a spherical harmonic expansion
($\text{P}_N$ method). Using a non-standard set of semi-norms, we obtain
estimates of the form $C(\varepsilon,\sigma,\Delta t)N^{-s}$ where $s\geq 1$
denotes the regularity of the solution in angle, $\varepsilon$ and $\sigma$ are
scattering parameters, $\Delta t$ is the time-step before reinitialization, and
$C$ is a complicated function of $\varepsilon$, $\sigma$, and $\Delta t$. These
estimates involve analysis of the multiscale RTE that includes, but necessarily
goes beyond, usual spectral analysis. We also compute error estimates for the

demonstrated great performance in many vision-language tasks. However,
image-text pairs for pre-training are restricted to the intersection of images

data, where noise can also be introduced as misaligned pairs during
pre-processing. Conversely, unimodal models trained on text or image data alone
through unsupervised techniques can achieve broader coverage of diverse
real-world data and are not constrained by the requirement of simultaneous
presence of image and text. In this paper, we demonstrate that using
large-scale unsupervised unimodal models as pre-training can enhance the
zero-shot performance of image-text pair models. Our thorough studies validate
that models pre-trained as such can learn rich representations of both
modalities, improving their ability to understand how images and text relate to
each other. Our experiments show that unimodal pre-training outperforms
state-of-the-art CLIP-based models by 6.5% (52.3% $\rightarrow$ 58.8%) on

of both modalities, unimodal pre-training offers broader coverage, reduced
misalignment errors, and the ability to capture more complex features and

symbolic regression method that leverages control variables to enhance both
accuracy and scalability. The core idea is to decompose multi-variable symbolic
regression into a set of single-variable SR problems, which are then combined
in a bottom-up manner. The proposed method involves a four-step process. First,
we learn a data generator from observed data using deep neural networks (DNNs).
Second, the data generator is used to generate samples for a certain variable
by controlling the input variables. Thirdly, single-variable symbolic
regression is applied to estimate the corresponding mathematical expression.
Lastly, we repeat steps 2 and 3 by gradually adding variables one by one until
completion. We evaluate the performance of our method on multiple benchmark

outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in discovering mathematical expressions
with multiple variables. Moreover, it can substantially reduce the search space

provide evidence for a similar phenomenon occurring in standard, unmanipulated
networks: feature visualizations are processed very differently from standard

  Texts",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rapidly increasing quality of AI-generated content makes it difficult to
distinguish between human and AI-generated texts, which may lead to undesirable
consequences for society. Therefore, it becomes increasingly important to study
the properties of human texts that are invariant over text domains and various
proficiency of human writers, can be easily calculated for any language, and
can robustly separate natural and AI-generated texts regardless of the
generation model and sampling method. In this work, we propose such an
invariant of human texts, namely the intrinsic dimensionality of the manifold
underlying the set of embeddings of a given text sample. We show that the
average intrinsic dimensionality of fluent texts in natural language is
hovering around the value $9$ for several alphabet-based languages and around
$7$ for Chinese, while the average intrinsic dimensionality of AI-generated
texts for each language is $\approx 1.5$ lower, with a clear statistical
separation between human-generated and AI-generated distributions. This
property allows us to build a score-based artificial text detector. The
proposed detector's accuracy is stable over text domains, generator models, and
human writer proficiency levels, outperforming SOTA detectors in model-agnostic
and cross-domain scenarios by a significant margin.

Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) has the potential to address this

zero-shot scenarios, as it is not clear how to apply it unsupervisedly.
  Our method, Prompter, uses descriptions of target domain slots to generate
dynamic prefixes that are concatenated to the key and values at each layer's
self-attention mechanism. This allows for the use of prefix-tuning in
zero-shot. Prompter outperforms previous methods on both the MultiWOZ and SGD
benchmarks. In generating prefixes, our analyses find that Prompter not only
utilizes the semantics of slot descriptions but also how often the slots appear
together in conversation. Moreover, Prompter's gains are due to its improved
ability to distinguish ""none""-valued dialogue slots, compared against

the structural parameters as a function of external pressure using
first-principles calculations combined with x-ray diffraction measurements. We
then examine the evolution of the electronic structure and magnetic exchange
interactions via first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We
find that the leading interlayer coupling is an antiferromagnetic
second-nearest neighbor interaction that increases monotonically with pressure.
The ratio between isotropic third- and first-nearest neighbor intralayer
exchanges, which controls the magnetic frustration and determines the magnetic
propagation vector $\mathbf{q}$ of the helimagnetic ground state, is also
enhanced by pressure. As a consequence, our Monte Carlo simulations show a
monotonic increase in the magnetic transition temperature, indicating that

non-convex dynamics of multi-contact motions, this approach is computationally
expensive. To enable online Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) of multi-contact

we propose a trajectory-based and a learning-based approach. In the former,
namely RHP with Multiple Levels of Model Fidelity, we approximate the value

the latter, namely Locally-Guided RHP, we learn an oracle to predict local

local value functions for guiding a short-horizon RHP. We evaluate both
approaches in simulation by planning centroidal trajectories of a humanoid
robot walking on moderate slopes, and on large slopes where the robot cannot
maintain static balance. Our results show that locally-guided RHP achieves the

hyper-realistic images from textual descriptions, has concurrently escalated
critical societal concerns such as misinformation. Traditional fake detection
mechanisms, although providing some mitigation, fall short in attributing
responsibility for the malicious use of synthetic images. This paper introduces
a novel approach to model fingerprinting that assigns responsibility for the
generated images, thereby serving as a potential countermeasure to model
misuse. Our method modifies generative models based on each user's unique
digital fingerprint, imprinting a unique identifier onto the resultant content
that can be traced back to the user. This approach, incorporating fine-tuning
into Text-to-Image (T2I) tasks using the Stable Diffusion Model, demonstrates
near-perfect attribution accuracy with a minimal impact on output quality. We
rigorously scrutinize our method's secrecy under two distinct scenarios: one
where a malicious user attempts to detect the fingerprint, and another where a
user possesses a comprehensive understanding of our method. We also evaluate
the robustness of our approach against various image post-processing
manipulations typically executed by end-users. Through extensive evaluation of
the Stable Diffusion models, our method presents a promising and novel avenue
for accountable model distribution and responsible use.

manner requires large volumes of high quality labels. While it is relatively
easy to capture large amounts of human point clouds, annotating 3D keypoints is
expensive, subjective, error prone and especially difficult for long-tail cases
(pedestrians with rare poses, scooterists, etc.). In this work, we propose
GC-KPL - Geometry Consistency inspired Key Point Leaning, an approach for
learning 3D human joint locations from point clouds without human labels. We
achieve this by our novel unsupervised loss formulations that account for the
structure and movement of the human body. We show that by training on a large
training set from Waymo Open Dataset without any human annotated keypoints, we
are able to achieve reasonable performance as compared to the fully supervised
approach. Further, the backbone benefits from the unsupervised training and is
useful in downstream fewshot learning of keypoints, where fine-tuning on only
10 percent of the labeled training data gives comparable performance to
fine-tuning on the entire set. We demonstrated that GC-KPL outperforms by a
large margin over SoTA when trained on entire dataset and efficiently leverages
large volumes of unlabeled data.

explain social and political phenomena. In most scenarios, CSS researchers
first obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable
regression analyses in the second step. The recent advancements in large
language models (LLMs) can lower costs for CSS research by annotating documents
cheaply at scale, but such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We
present a new algorithm for using outputs from LLMs for downstream statistical
analyses while guaranteeing statistical properties -- like asymptotic
unbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification -- which are fundamental to
CSS research. We show that direct use of LLM-predicted surrogate labels in
downstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid
confidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80--90\%. To address
this, we build on debiased machine learning to propose the design-based
semi-supervised learning (DSL) estimator. DSL employs a doubly-robust procedure
to combine surrogate labels with a smaller number of gold-standard labels. Our
approach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even
when surrogates are arbitrarily biased, without requiring stringent
assumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for
gold-standard labeling. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results
show that DSL provides valid statistical inference while achieving root mean
squared errors comparable to existing alternatives that focus only on
prediction without statistical guarantees.

phase picker - OBSTransformer, based on automated labelling and transfer

recorded by 423 OBSs from 11 temporary deployments worldwide. Through automated
processes, we label the P and S phases of these earthquakes by analysing the
consistency of at least three arrivals from four widely used machine learning
pickers (EqTransformer, PhaseNet, Generalized Phase Detection, and PickNet), as
well as the AIC picker. This results in an inclusive OBS dataset containing
~36,000 earthquake samples. Subsequently, we employ this dataset for transfer
learning and utilize a well-trained land machine learning model - EqTransformer
as our base model. Moreover, we extract 25,000 OBS noise samples from the same
OBS networks using the Kurtosis method, which are then used for model training
alongside the labelled earthquake samples. Using three groups of test datasets
at sub-global, regional, and local scales, we demonstrate that OBSTransformer
outperforms EqTransformer. Particularly, the P and S recall rates at large

perform extensive numerical simulations of random circuits in $1\le d\le 4$

labeled samples. However, for tabular datasets with extremely high
$d$-dimensional features but limited $n$ samples (i.e. $d \gg n$), machine
learning models struggle to achieve strong performance due to the risk of
overfitting. Here, our key insight is that there is often abundant, auxiliary
domain information describing input features which can be structured as a
heterogeneous knowledge graph (KG). We propose PLATO, a method that achieves
strong performance on tabular data with $d \gg n$ by using an auxiliary KG
describing input features to regularize a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In
PLATO, each input feature corresponds to a node in the auxiliary KG. In the
MLP's first layer, each input feature also corresponds to a weight vector.
PLATO is based on the inductive bias that two input features corresponding to
similar nodes in the auxiliary KG should have similar weight vectors in the
MLP's first layer. PLATO captures this inductive bias by inferring the weight
vector for each input feature from its corresponding node in the KG via a
trainable message-passing function. Across 6 $d \gg n$ datasets, PLATO
outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.19%.

occultation and transit events in late 2021. A photometric campaign was
organized and observations were taken by the TRAPPIST-South, SPECULOOS-Artemis,
OWL-Net, and BOAO telescopes, with the goal to constrain models of this system.
Our dynamical model is complex, with multipoles (up to the order $\ell = 2$),
internal tides, and external tides. The model was constrained by astrometry
(spanning 2001--2021), occultations, adaptive-optics imaging, calibrated
photometry, as well as relative photometry. Our photometric model was
substantially improved. A new precise (${<}\,0.1\,{\rm mmag}$) light curve
algorithm was implemented, based on polygon intersections, which are computed
exactly -- by including partial eclipses and partial visibility of polygons.
Moreover, we implemented a `cliptracing' algorithm, based again on polygon
intersections, in which partial contributions to individual pixels are computed
exactly. Both synthetic light curves and synthetic images are then very smooth.
Based on our combined solution, we confirmed the size of Linus, $(28\pm
1)\,{\rm km}$. However, this solution exhibits some tension between the light
curves and the PISCO speckle-interferometry dataset. In most solutions, Linus
is darker than Kalliope, with the albedos $A_{\rm w} = 0.40$ vs. $0.44$. This
is confirmed on deconvolved images. A~detailed revision of astrometric data
allowed us to revise also the $J_2 \equiv -C_{20}$ value of Kalliope. Most
importantly, a~homogeneous body is excluded. For a differentiated body, two
solutions exist: low-oblateness ($C_{20} \simeq -0.12$), with a~spherical iron
core, and alternatively, high-oblateness ($C_{20} \simeq -0.22$) with an
elongated iron core. These correspond to the low- and high-energy collisions,
respectively, studied by means of SPH simulations in our previous work.

projection operator and general retraction, we show that the Riemannian
gradient descent with a unit step size has locally linear convergence if the
network has a satisfactory level of connectivity. Moreover, based on the
geometry of the compact submanifold, we prove that a convexity-like regularity

explicitly characterized neighborhood around the solution set of the nonconvex

a weaker connectivity requirement on the decentralized network, we present a
comprehensive analysis of the linear convergence of the Riemannian gradient

Furthermore, if the network is well connected, we demonstrate that the local
Lipschitz continuity endowed by proximal smoothness is a sufficient condition
for the restricted secant inequality, thus contributing to the local error

angle distributions, and pressure signatures of both inside and outside
switchbacks, separating a switchback into spike, transition region (TR), and
quiet period (QP). Based on our analysis, we find that the proton temperature
anisotropies in TRs seem to show an intermediate state between spike and QP
plasmas. The proton temperatures are more enhanced in spike than in TR and QP,
but the alpha temperatures and alpha-to-proton temperature ratios show the
opposite trends, implying that the preferential heating mechanisms of protons
and alphas are competing in different regions of switchbacks. Moreover, our
results suggest that the electron integrated intensities are almost the same
across the switchbacks but the electron pitch angle distributions are more
isotropic inside than outside switchbacks, implying switchbacks are intact
structures but strong scattering of electrons happens inside switchbacks. In
addition, the examination of pressures reveals that the total pressures are
comparable through a switchback, confirming switchbacks are pressure-balanced
structures. These characteristics could further our understanding of ion
heating, electron scattering, and the structure of switchbacks.

(VHE) $\gamma$-ray photon index. The results suggest that the universe to VHE
$\gamma$-rays is becoming more transparent than usually expected. We introduce
the extragalactic background light (EBL) plus the photon to axion-like particle
(ALP) oscillations to explain this phenomenon. We concentrate our analysis on
70 blazars up to redshift $z \simeq 1$. Assuming this correlation is solely the
result of photon-photon absorption of VHE photons with the EBL, which finds the
deviations between the predictions and observations, especially at redshifts
$0.2 < z < 1$. We then discuss the implications of photon-ALP oscillations for
the VHE $\gamma$-ray spectra of blazars. A strong evidence shows that: 1) the
EBL attenuation results that the VHE $\gamma$-ray photon index increases
non-linearly at the ranges of redshift, $0.03 < z < 0.2$; 2) the photon-ALP
oscillation results in a attractive characteristic in the VHE $\gamma$-ray
photon index at the ranges of redshift, $0.2 < z < 1$. We suggest that both the
EBL absorption and photon-ALP oscillation can influence on the propagation of
VHE $\gamma$-rays from distant blazars.

in multiple documents into a concise summary. The generated summary can save
the time of reading many documents by providing the important content in the

summary for multiple documents using natural language generation techniques. In
this paper, we consider the unsupervised abstractive MDS setting where there
are only documents with no groundtruh summaries provided, and we propose
Absformer, a new Transformer-based method for unsupervised abstractive summary
generation. Our method consists of a first step where we pretrain a
Transformer-based encoder using the masked language modeling (MLM) objective as
the pretraining task in order to cluster the documents into semantically
similar groups; and a second step where we train a Transformer-based decoder to
generate abstractive summaries for the clusters of documents. To our knowledge,
we are the first to successfully incorporate a Transformer-based model to solve
the unsupervised abstractive MDS task. We evaluate our approach using three
real-world datasets from different domains, and we demonstrate both substantial
improvements in terms of evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art
abstractive-based methods, and generalization to datasets from different
domains.

Si3N4 and SiO2 samples were etched by NF3/O2 and NF3/O2/N2/H2 plasmas. The
sources of the plasmas were removed from the etched sample to exclude a
damaging from UV emission and ion bombardment. Optical emission spectroscopy
and mass-spectroscopy were used during the etching. The reaction mechanisms
were studied using quantum chemistry methods. It was suggested analytical
models, which quantitively describe dependence of Si3N4 and SiO2 etch rate on
the fluxes of key reactants in NF3/O2 and NF3/O2/N2/H2 downstream plasmas. The
densities of the kye reagents were measured and calculated using plasma
simulation. Thus, the Si3N4 etch rate curve in NF3/O2 mixture has a peak, where
NO density peaks. The high and narrow Si3N4/SiO2 selectivity peaks, which
appears in NF3/O2/N2/H2, correlates with high and narrow density peak of
vibration excited HF(v1) molecule. Also, this research was aimed to study a
mechanism of precursor formation of boron nitride nanotubes growth during high
temperature synthesis. It was shown that boron consumption (it is the main
impediment to large scale production) occurs through the reactions of N2
dissociative adsorption on small boron clusters (N2 fixation) resulting in
generation of B4N4 and B5N4 chains. The liquid boron is only source of the
small boron clusters. A subsequent formation of longer chains occurs via
collisions of B4N4 and B5N4 with each other. It was also shown that slow gas
cooling rate and high pressure enhance liquid boron consumption during the
synthesis, creating a good condition to large scale production of high purity

high-stakes applications, such as drug discovery, require human-intelligible

essential for us to reap the benefits of AI.
  We propose an explainability algorithm for GNNs called eXplainable Insight
(XInsight) that generates a distribution of model explanations using GFlowNets.
Since GFlowNets generate objects with probabilities proportional to a reward,
XInsight can generate a diverse set of explanations, compared to previous
methods that only learn the maximum reward sample. We demonstrate XInsight by
generating explanations for GNNs trained on two graph classification tasks:
classifying mutagenic compounds with the MUTAG dataset and classifying acyclic
graphs with a synthetic dataset that we have open-sourced. We show the utility
of XInsight's explanations by analyzing the generated compounds using QSAR
modeling, and we find that XInsight generates compounds that cluster by
lipophilicity, a known correlate of mutagenicity. Our results show that
XInsight generates a distribution of explanations that uncovers the underlying
relationships demonstrated by the model. They also highlight the importance of
generating a diverse set of explanations, as it enables us to discover hidden

features in groups while reconstructing the class centroids in the ambient
space and simultaneously use additional penalty terms in the bottleneck layer
to decrease within-class scatter and increase the separation of different class
centroids. The model has a sparsity-promoting layer (SPL) with a one-to-one
connection to the input layer. Along with the primary objective, we minimize
the $l_{2,1}$-norm of the sparse layer, which filters out unnecessary features
from input data. During training, we update class centroids by taking the
Hadamard product of the centroids and weights of the sparse layer, thus
ignoring the irrelevant features from the target. Therefore the proposed method
learns to reconstruct the critical components of class centroids rather than
the whole centroids. The algorithm is applied to various real-world data sets,
including high-dimensional biological, image, speech, and accelerometer sensor
data. We compared our method to different state-of-the-art feature selection

measurements demonstrated that the thin film alloys were homogeneously mixed

films epitaxially grown on MgF$_2$ exhibited compressive strain along all three
crystallographic axes which resulted in piezomagnetic effects. The
piezomagnetism disappeared if the film was grown on a (MnNi)F$_2$ graded buffer

the Mn concentration $x$, which takes into account piezomagnetic effects, gave
a magnetic exchange constant between Mn and Ni ions of $J_{\text{MnNi}} = 0.305

an oblique antiferromagnetic phase in the Mn$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$F$_2$ alloy which

a helical phase. The phase diagram is quantitatively different from that of

biological-plausibility of conventional artificial neural networks and the

emulates a more biologically realistic network of multi-compartment pyramidal

our approach provides a natural resolution to the weight symmetry problem
between forward and backward signal propagation paths, a significant critique
against the plausibility of the conventional backpropagation algorithm. This is
achieved by leveraging two alternative, yet equivalent forms of the correlative

for Unified Medical Image Segmentation (GTGM), a framework that extends of VLP
to 3D medical images without relying on paired textual descriptions.
Specifically, GTGM utilizes large language models (LLM) to generate
medical-style text from 3D medical images. This synthetic text is then used to
supervise 3D visual representation learning. Furthermore, a negative-free
contrastive learning objective strategy is introduced to cultivate consistent
visual representations between augmented 3D medical image patches, which
effectively mitigates the biases associated with strict positive-negative
sample pairings. We evaluate GTGM on three imaging modalities - Computed

traditionally performed with collisionally excited lines at wavelengths in the
Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray. However, such emission is difficult to
observe beyond the inner corona (1.5 R$_\odot$), particularly in coronal holes.
Given the importance of the $T_e$ distribution in the corona for exploring the
viability of different heating processes, we introduce an analog of the DEM
specifically for radiatively excited coronal emission lines, such as those
observed during total solar eclipses (TSEs) and with coronagraphs. This
Radiative DEM (R-DEM) inversion utilizes visible and infrared emission lines
which are excited by photospheric radiation out to at least 3 R$_\odot$.

Neighboring Extremal (NE) has been developed as an efficient optimal adaption
strategy to adapt a pre-computed nominal control solution to perturbations from
the nominal trajectory. The resulting control law is a time-varying feedback
gain that can be pre-computed along with the original optimal control problem,
and it takes negligible online computation. However, existing NE frameworks
only deal with state perturbations while in modern applications, optimal
controllers (e.g., predictive controllers) frequently incorporate preview

perturbations. In this work, an extended NE (ENE) framework is developed to
systematically adapt the nominal control to both state and preview
perturbations. We show that the derived ENE law is two time-varying feedback
gains on the state perturbation and the preview perturbation. We also develop
schemes to handle nominal non-optimal solutions and large perturbations to
retain optimal performance and constraint satisfaction. Case study on nonlinear
model predictive control is presented due to its popularity but it can be
easily extended to other optimal control schemes. Promising simulation results

policies that depend deterministically on the current state in environments

by chosen actions. Such settings are common in a wide range of high-stake
applications and are actively investigated in the context of stochastic
control. Our procedure exploits that similar state/action pairs (in a metric
sense) are associated with similar rewards and state transitions. This enables
our resampling procedure to tackle the counterfactual estimation problem
underlying off-policy evaluation (OPE) by simulating trajectories similarly to
Monte Carlo methods. Compared to other OPE methods, our algorithm does not
require optimization, can be efficiently implemented via tree-based nearest
neighbor search and parallelization and does not explicitly assume a parametric
model for the environment's dynamics. These properties make the proposed
resampling algorithm particularly useful for stochastic control environments.
We prove that our method is statistically consistent in estimating the
performance of a policy in the OPE setting under weak assumptions and for data
sets containing entire episodes rather than independent transitions. To
establish the consistency, we generalize Stone's Theorem, a well-known result
in nonparametric statistics on local averaging, to include episodic data and
the counterfactual estimation underlying OPE. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the algorithm in a variety of stochastic control settings

necessary after finding the optimal architectures.
  In this work, we propose mixture-of-supernets, a generalized supernet
formulation where mixture-of-experts (MoE) is adopted to enhance the expressive

different subnetworks do not share the model weights directly, but through an

heterogeneous large-scale datasets without extra annotation cost. In this work,
we propose a scalable multi-dataset detector (ScaleDet) that can scale up its
generalization across datasets when increasing the number of training datasets.
Unlike existing multi-dataset learners that mostly rely on manual relabelling
efforts or sophisticated optimizations to unify labels across datasets, we
introduce a simple yet scalable formulation to derive a unified semantic label
space for multi-dataset training. ScaleDet is trained by visual-textual
alignment to learn the label assignment with label semantic similarities across
datasets. Once trained, ScaleDet can generalize well on any given upstream and
downstream datasets with seen and unseen classes. We conduct extensive
experiments using LVIS, COCO, Objects365, OpenImages as upstream datasets, and
13 datasets from Object Detection in the Wild (ODinW) as downstream datasets.
Our results show that ScaleDet achieves compelling strong model performance
with an mAP of 50.7 on LVIS, 58.8 on COCO, 46.8 on Objects365, 76.2 on

occurring in the string. K-spectra have many applications in bioinformatics
including pseudoalignment and genome assembly. The Spectral Burrows-Wheeler
Transform (SBWT) has been recently introduced as an algorithmic tool to
efficiently represent and query these objects. The longest common prefix (LCP)
array for a k-spectrum is an array of length n that stores the length of the
longest common prefix of adjacent k-mers as they occur in lexicographical
order. The LCP array has at least two important applications, namely to
accelerate pseudoalignment algorithms using the SBWT and to allow simulation of
variable-order de Bruijn graphs within the SBWT framework. In this paper we
explore algorithms to compute the LCP array efficiently from the SBWT
representation of the k-spectrum. Starting with a straightforward O(nk) time
algorithm, we describe algorithms that are efficient in both theory and
practice. We show that the LCP array can be computed in optimal O(n) time,
where n is the length of the SBWT of the spectrum. In practical genomics
scenarios, we show that this theoretically optimal algorithm is indeed
practical, but is often outperformed on smaller values of k by an
asymptotically suboptimal algorithm that interacts better with the CPU cache.
Our algorithms share some features with both classical Burrows-Wheeler
inversion algorithms and LCP array construction algorithms for suffix arrays.

the phase transition point, VQE tends to converge to the excited states when
the number of variational parameters is not large enough. For the system
studied in this work, this issue can be solved by either increasing the number

on different combustion metrics, including static and dynamic flame
stabilization; fewer studies have been devoted to the backward problem: or the
significance of having a strongly inhomogeneous environment, often unsteady in

backward problem is addressed in a hierarchical manner. First, the implications
of the discharge proceeding in an inhomogeneous background gas, with gradients
in density and composition, and nonuniform flows, are discussed. Next, these
foundation experiments are used as elementary building blocks to explain
experiments of nanosecond pulsed discharges in dynamic combustion environments,
including a transient laminar flame and a combustor undergoing dynamics.
Finally, the strong coupling between the forward and backward problem is
illustrated with an imaging study, using transparent electrodes, of a mesoscale

Many studies have proposed approaches to address the challenges of client
selection of FL. However, no systematic literature review (SLR) on this topic

and answers the challenges, solutions, and metrics to evaluate the solutions.
We systematically reviewed 47 primary studies. The main challenges found in

and fairness. The client selection schemes aim to improve the original random
selection algorithm by focusing on one or several of the aforementioned
challenges. The most common metric used is testing accuracy versus
communication rounds, as testing accuracy measures the successfulness of the
learning and preferably in as few communication rounds as possible, as they are
very expensive. Although several possible improvements can be made with the
current state of client selection, the most beneficial ones are evaluating the

Our model consists of the spacetime and scalar field with self-interaction

the vacua of the scalar field. We demonstrate that the quantum dynamics of the
vacua can be described by the Redfield equation, which can depict the evolution
of both coherence and the comoving volume fraction of the vacuum. Under the
Markovian limit, coherence monotonically decreases with time, leading to the
initial quantum state to decohere into a classical state. This helps the
understanding of the decoherence of the universe. We also highlight that in
certain circumstances, the evolution of the vacuum system may display
non-Markovian dynamics. In specific scenarios, the classical limit of the
quantum master equation is consistent with the classical master equation. In
the steady state, the dominant vacuum corresponds to the smallest cosmological
constant, and various dS vacua can reach equilibrium states.

procedures to obtain calibrated ppps (cppps) have been proposed although not

model estimation via MCMC. Here we give methods to balance the computational
trade-off between the number of calibration replicates and the number of MCMC

(FFPs) and bulge brown dwarfs (BDs). In contrast to the six BD (25 < theta_E <

KMT-2022-BLG-2397 has a dwarf-star source, with angular radius theta_* ~ 0.9

for characterizing FFPs and BDs from finite-source point-lens (FSPL)
microlensing events. We find `dwarfs' (including main-sequence stars and
subgiants) are likely to yield twice as many theta_E measurements for BDs and a
comparable (but more difficult to quantify) improvement for FFPs. We show that
neither current nor planned experiments will yield complete mass measurements
of isolated bulge BDs, nor will any other planned experiment yield as many
theta_E measurements for these objects as KMT. Thus, the currently anticipated
10-year KMT survey will remain the best way to study bulge BDs for several
decades to come.

radio signal classification tasks. In FL, model parameters are periodically
communicated from participating devices, which train on local datasets, to a

privacy/security advantages due to raw data not leaving the devices, it is
still susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we first reveal the
susceptibility of FL-based signal classifiers to model poisoning attacks, which
compromise the training process despite not observing data transmissions. In
this capacity, we develop an attack framework that significantly degrades the
training process of the global model. Our attack framework induces a more
potent model poisoning attack to the global classifier than existing baselines
while also being able to compromise existing server-driven defenses. In
response to this gap, we develop Underlying Server Defense of Federated

We subsequently compare the defensive efficacy, runtimes, and false positive

researchers and practitioners. However, existing works are limited in
independent generation of each element, i.e., flow, in OD matrix, overlooking
the element relations within the matrix that can be well formulated as a

from the network perspective, and design a graph denoising diffusion method to
learn the conditional joint probability distribution of all elements in the OD
matrix given city characteristics at region level. To overcome the learning
difficulty of the city-wide OD matrix covering over thousands of regions, we
decompose the original one-shot generative modeling of the diffusion model into
two cascaded stages, corresponding to the generation of network topology and
mobility flow, respectively. To further reproduce important network properties
contained in city-wide OD matrices, we design an elaborated graph denoising
network structure including a node property augmentation module and a graph
transformer backbone. Empirical experiments on data collected in two large US
cities have verified that our method can generate OD matrices for new cities
with network statistics remarkably similar with the ground truth, further
achieving superior outperformance over competitive baselines in terms of the

discussion and comparison of different temporal conditions. Based on the
observations, we propose an effective temporally-conditional diffusion model
coined Temporally-Composable Diffuser (TCD), which extracts temporal

temporal conditions. Specifically, we separate the sequences into three parts
according to time expansion and identify historical, immediate, and prospective
conditions accordingly. Each condition preserves non-overlapping temporal

use them to guide the diffuser. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and

quantization offers a solution which simultaneously reduces memory footprint

unacceptable loss in model accuracy owing to differences in sensitivity to
numerical imperfection across different layers in the model. To address this
challenge, we propose a mixed-precision post training quantization (PTQ)
approach that assigns different numerical precisions to tensors in a network

latency while preserving model accuracy. Previous works rely on layer-wise
Hessian information to determine numerical precision, but as we demonstrate,
Hessian estimation is typically insufficient in determining an effective
ordering of layer sensitivities. We address this by augmenting the estimated
Hessian with additional information to capture inter-layer dependencies. We
demonstrate that this consistently improves PTQ performance along the
accuracy-latency Pareto frontier across multiple models. Our method combines
second-order information and inter-layer dependencies to guide a bisection

accuracy degradation range. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on the
ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and BERT models. Our experiments demonstrate latency
reductions compared to a 16-bit baseline of $25.48\%$, $21.69\%$, and $33.28\%$

the mediation of turbulent dissipation in the solar wind by ion-cyclotron
waves. Our results show that ion-cyclotron waves interact strongly with
magnetized turbulence, indicating that they serve as a major pathway for the
dissipation of large-scale electromagnetic fluctuations. We further show that
the presence of cyclotron waves significantly weakens observed signatures of
intermittency in sub-ion-kinetic turbulence, which are known to be another
pathway for dissipation. These observations results suggest that in the absence
of cyclotron resonant waves, non-Gaussian, coherent structures are able to form
at sub-ion-kinetic scales, and are likely responsible for turbulent heating. We
further find that the cross helicity, i.e. the level of Alfv\'enicity of the
fluctuations, correlates strongly with the presence of ion-scale waves,
demonstrating that dissipation of collisionless plasma turbulence is not a
universal process, but that the pathways to heating and dissipation at small
scales are controlled by the properties of the large-scale turbulent
fluctuations. We argue that these observations support the existence of a
helicity barrier, in which highly Alfv\'enic, imbalanced, turbulence is
prevented from cascading to sub-ion scales thus resulting in significant
ion-cyclotron resonant heating. Our results may serve as a significant step in
constraining the nature of turbulent heating in a wide variety of astrophysical

Generalizing diffusion to incorporate physical interactions, we find that weak

with a mapping to the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. In contrast, strong
repulsive interactions typically generate oscillating lattices, and strong
attraction leads to an interplay of phase separation and chemical oscillations,
like droplets co-locating with cores of spiral waves. Our work suggests that
physical interactions are relevant for forming spatiotemporal patterns in

natural price-adjustment processes by which sellers and buyers in a market can

auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by French economist Walras in
which sellers adjust prices based on the Marshallian demands of buyers. A dual
concept in consumer theory is a buyer's Hicksian demand. In this paper, we
identify the maximum of the absolute value of the elasticity of the Hicksian
demand, as an economic parameter sufficient to capture and explain a range of
convergent and non-convergent t\^atonnement behaviors in a broad class of
markets. In particular, we prove the convergence of t\^atonnement at a rate of
$O((1+\varepsilon^2)/T)$, in homothetic Fisher markets with bounded price
elasticity of Hicksian demand, i.e., Fisher markets in which consumers have
preferences represented by homogeneous utility functions and the price
elasticity of their Hicksian demand is bounded, where $\varepsilon \geq 0$ is
the maximum absolute value of the price elasticity of Hicksian demand across
all buyers. Our result not only generalizes known convergence results for CES
Fisher markets, but extends them to mixed nested CES markets and Fisher markets
with continuous, possibly non-concave, homogeneous utility functions. Our
convergence rate covers the full spectrum of nested CES utilities, including
Leontief and linear utilities, unifying previously existing disparate
convergence and non-convergence results. In particular, for $\varepsilon = 0$,
i.e., Leontief markets, we recover the best-known convergence rate of $O(1/T)$,
and as $\varepsilon \to \infty$, e.g., linear Fisher markets, we obtain
non-convergent behavior, as expected.

for several problems such as linear regression, trained transformers learn
algorithms for learning functions in context. However, the inductive biases of
these models resulting in this behavior are not clearly understood. A model
with unlimited training data and compute is a Bayesian predictor: it learns the
pretraining distribution. It has been shown that high-capacity transformers
mimic the Bayesian predictor for linear regression. In this paper, we show
empirical evidence of transformers exhibiting the behavior of this ideal
learner across different linear and non-linear function classes. We also extend
the previous setups to work in the multitask setting and verify that
transformers can do in-context learning in this setup as well and the Bayesian
perspective sheds light on this setting also. Finally, via the example of

novel deep learning based approach is developed and applied to solving these
types of problems. The approach utilizes samples of the inferred vector drawn
from the prior distribution and a physics-based forward model to generate
training data for a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network
(cWGAN). The cWGAN learns the probability distribution for the inferred vector
conditioned on the measurement and produces samples from this distribution. The
cWGAN developed in this work differs from earlier versions in that its critic
is required to be 1-Lipschitz with respect to both the inferred and the

full (and not partial) gradient penalty. It is shown that this rather simple
change leads to a stronger notion of convergence for the conditional density
learned by the cWGAN and a more robust and accurate sampling strategy. Through
numerical examples it is shown that this change also translates to better
accuracy when solving inverse problems. The numerical examples considered

learning relies on understanding the similarity between the ground truth of the
source and target tasks. In real-world applications, tasks often exhibit
partial similarity, where certain aspects are similar while others are
different or irrelevant. To investigate the impact of partial similarity on
transfer learning performance, we focus on a linear regression model with two
distinct sets of features: a common part shared across tasks and a
task-specific part. Our study explores various types of transfer learning,
encompassing two options for parameter transfer. By establishing a theoretical
characterization on the error of the learned model, we compare these transfer
learning options, particularly examining how generalization performance changes
with the number of features/parameters in both underparameterized and
overparameterized regimes. Furthermore, we provide practical guidelines for
determining the number of features in the common and task-specific parts for
improved generalization performance. For example, when the total number of
features in the source task's learning model is fixed, we show that it is more
advantageous to allocate a greater number of redundant features to the
task-specific part rather than the common part. Moreover, in specific
scenarios, particularly those characterized by high noise levels and small true

employing more redundant features in the task-specific part can yield notable

simulated census method, called ELL, based on a one-fold nested error model for
a suitable transformation of the welfare variable. Modified ELL methods leading
to significant gain in efficiency over ELL also have been proposed under the
one-fold model. An advantage of ELL and modified ELL methods is that
distributional assumptions on the random effects in the model are not needed.

long-standing challenge for mobile robots. While deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) has attracted a rapidly growing interest in solving such an autonomous
navigation problem for its generalization capability, DRL typically leads to a
mediocre navigation performance in practice due to the gap between the training
scene and the actual test scene. Most existing work focuses on tuning the
algorithm to enhance its transferability, whereas few investigates how to
quantify or measure the gap therebetween. This letter presents a local
map-based deep Q-network (DQN) navigation algorithm, which uses local maps
converted from 2D LiDAR data as observations without a global map. More
importantly, this letter proposes a new transferability metric -- the scene
similarity calculated from an improved image template matching algorithm to
measure the similarity between the training and test scenes. With a wheeled
robot as the case study platform, both simulation and real-world experiments
are conducted in a total of 20 different scenes. The case study results
successfully validate the local map-based navigation algorithm as well as the
similarity metric in predicting the transferability or success rate of the

problem, and despite active studies in recent years, it remains a great
challenge. In this paper, we take a simple yet effective approach to tackle
this issue. We propose test-time style shifting, which shifts the style of the
test sample (that has a large style gap with the source domains) to the nearest
source domain that the model is already familiar with, before making the
prediction. This strategy enables the model to handle any target domains with
arbitrary style statistics, without additional model update at test-time.
Additionally, we propose style balancing, which provides a great platform for
maximizing the advantage of test-time style shifting by handling the
DG-specific imbalance issues. The proposed ideas are easy to implement and
successfully work in conjunction with various other DG schemes. Experimental
results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our methods.

process is characterized by local plastic events leading to non-affine

structural order, these disordered materials exhibit long-range spatial
correlations in the non-affine displacement fields, which stems from the
underlying elasticity. Measuring a correlation length scale in deformed
amorphous solids, during the plastic process, is a non-trivial challenge, often
requiring an ad-hoc definition of localized regions. In this paper, we
introduce a novel computational approach called the ""soft matrix"" that enables
systematic analysis of mechanical response of local regions within a disordered
solid. In this method, we subject the amorphous solid to a quasistatic shear
and allow a local region of interest to relax freely while allowing for elastic
relaxation of the background. The dependence of the yield strain upon the size
of the probe region naturally reveals the existence of an intrinsic length
scale ($\zeta$) that governs the elasto-plastic properties, as observed in four
distinct model amorphous solids. This finding demonstrates the universality of
this characteristic length scale across a wide range of materials. We
investigate the dependence of this length scale on the material's preparation
history and find that $\zeta$ increases with better annealing. Furthermore, the
local mechanical properties measured within this framework provide more
accurate estimates compared to existing techniques. Our study paves the way for
a comprehensive understanding of amorphous solids and facilitates improved

detect lane lines based on the BEV features. However, IPM ignores the changes
in road height, leading to inaccurate view transformations. Additionally, the
two separate stages of the process can cause cumulative errors and increased
complexity. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient transformer
for 3D lane detection. Different from the vanilla transformer, our model
contains a decomposed cross-attention mechanism to simultaneously learn lane
and BEV representations. The mechanism decomposes the cross-attention between
image-view and BEV features into the one between image-view and lane features,
and the one between lane and BEV features, both of which are supervised with
ground-truth lane lines. Our method obtains 2D and 3D lane predictions by
applying the lane features to the image-view and BEV features, respectively.
This allows for a more accurate view transformation than IPM-based methods, as
the view transformation is learned from data with a supervised cross-attention.
Additionally, the cross-attention between lane and BEV features enables them to
adjust to each other, resulting in more accurate lane detection than the two
separate stages. Finally, the decomposed cross-attention is more efficient than
the original one. Experimental results on OpenLane and ONCE-3DLanes demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Part I of this work with a mathematical justification leveraging a
semi-discrete analysis framework for assessing the splitting error of process
coupling methods. The novelty of the framework is that splitting error is
distinguished from the process time integration errors, i.e., the errors caused
by discrete time integration of individual processes, leading to expressions
that are more easily interpreted utilizing existing physical understanding of
the processes that the terms represent. This application of this framework to
dust life cycle in EAMv1 showcases such an interpretation, using the
leading-order splitting error that results from the framework to confirm (i)
that the original EAMv1 scheme artificially strengthens the effect of dry
removal processes, and (ii) that the revised splitting reduces that artificial
strengthening. While the error analysis framework is presented in the context
of the dust life cycle in EAMv1, the framework can be broadly leveraged to
evaluate process coupling schemes, both in other physical problems and for any
number of processes. This framework will be particularly powerful when the
various process implementations support a variety of time integration
approaches. Whereas traditional local truncation error approaches require
separate consideration of each combination of time integration methods, this
framework enables evaluation of coupling schemes independent of particular time
integration approaches for each process while still allowing for the
incorporation of these specific time integration errors if so desired. The
framework also explains how the splitting error terms result from (i) the
integration of individual processes in isolation from other processes, and (ii)

provide code suggestions inside a programmer's environment (e.g., an IDE) with

accept and reject suggestions, ideally, such a system should use this feedback

interacting with Copilot to develop interventions that can save programmer

programmers and decides when and which suggestions to display. Our framework
Conditional suggestion Display from Human Feedback (CDHF) is based on
predictive models of programmer actions. Using data from 535 programmers we
build models that predict the likelihood of suggestion acceptance. In a
retrospective evaluation on real-world programming tasks solved with

technique for representation learning, it doesn't generalize well on
long-tailed datasets due to the majority classes dominating the feature space.
Recent work shows that the long-tailed learning performance could be boosted by
sampling extra in-domain (ID) data for self-supervised training, however,
large-scale ID data which can rebalance the minority classes are expensive to
collect. In this paper, we propose an alternative but easy-to-use and effective
solution, Contrastive with Out-of-distribution (OOD) data for Long-Tail
learning (COLT), which can effectively exploit OOD data to dynamically
re-balance the feature space. We empirically identify the counter-intuitive
usefulness of OOD samples in SSL long-tailed learning and principally design a
novel SSL method. Concretely, we first localize the `head' and `tail' samples
by assigning a tailness score to each OOD sample based on its neighborhoods in
the feature space. Then, we propose an online OOD sampling strategy to
dynamically re-balance the feature space. Finally, we enforce the model to be
capable of distinguishing ID and OOD samples by a distribution-level supervised
contrastive loss. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets and
several state-of-the-art SSL frameworks to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. The results show that our method significantly improves the
performance of SSL on long-tailed datasets by a large margin, and even
outperforms previous work which uses external ID data. Our code is available at

within the context of many-body quantum spin systems. In mean-field
approximations of a quantum problem, one usually focuses on attaining the
global minimum of the resulting energy function, while other minimum solutions
are usually ignored. For frustrated systems, a strict distinction between
global and local minimum is often not tenable since first-order type
transitions can interchange the roles played by two different minima. This begs
the question of whether there is any physical interpretation for the local
minima encountered in mean-field approximations of quantum systems. We look at
the problem from the perspective of quantum spin systems. Two models are
studied, a frustrated model with quenched disorder, and a pure system without
frustration. Accurate classical energies of the minima are compared with the
full spectrum of energy levels, allowing us to search for signs of
correspondence between them. It is found that the local minima can generally be
interpreted as excited energy eigenstates. Instances of spurious minima are

  https://vikr-182.github.io/UAP-BEV",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous driving requires accurate reasoning of the location of objects
from raw sensor data. Recent end-to-end learning methods go from raw sensor
data to a trajectory output via Bird's Eye View(BEV) segmentation as an
interpretable intermediate representation. Motion planning over cost maps
generated via Birds Eye View (BEV) segmentation has emerged as a prominent
approach in autonomous driving. However, the current approaches have two
critical gaps. First, the optimization process is simplistic and involves just
evaluating a fixed set of trajectories over the cost map. The trajectory
samples are not adapted based on their associated cost values. Second, the
existing cost maps do not account for the uncertainty in the cost maps that can
arise due to noise in RGB images, and BEV annotations. As a result, these
approaches can struggle in challenging scenarios where there is abrupt cut-in,
stopping, overtaking, merging, etc from the neighboring vehicles.
  In this paper, we propose UAP-BEV: A novel approach that models the noise in
Spatio-Temporal BEV predictions to create an uncertainty-aware occupancy grid
map. Using queries of the distance to the closest occupied cell, we obtain a
sample estimate of the collision probability of the ego-vehicle. Subsequently,
our approach uses gradient-free sampling-based optimization to compute low-cost
trajectories over the cost map. Importantly, the sampling distribution is
adapted based on the optimal cost values of the sampled trajectories. By
explicitly modeling probabilistic collision avoidance in the BEV space, our
approach is able to outperform the cost-map-based baselines in collision
avoidance, route completion, time to completion, and smoothness. To further
validate our method, we also show results on the real-world dataset NuScenes,
where we report improvements in collision avoidance and smoothness.

targeted search of the redback optical candidate coincident with the
$\gamma$-ray source 3FGL J0212.5+5320 using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank
Telescope (GBT) with the Breakthrough Listen backend at L-band. Over a seven
month period, five pointings were made near inferior conjunction of the pulsar
in its 20.9 hr orbit, resulting in two detections, lasting 12 and 42 minutes.
The pulsar dispersion measure (DM) of 25.7 pc cm$^{-3}$ corresponds to a
distance of 1.15 kpc in the NE2001 Galactic electron density model, consistent
with the Gaia parallax distance of $1.16\pm0.03$ kpc for the companion star. We
suspect the pulsar experiences wide-orbit eclipses, similar to other redbacks,
as well as scintillation and DM delays caused by its interaction with its
companion and surroundings. Although the pulsar was only detected over
$\approx3.7\%$ of the orbit, its measured acceleration is consistent with
published binary parameters from optical radial velocity spectroscopy and
light-curve modeling of the companion star, and it provides a more precise mass
ratio and a projected semi-major axis for the pulsar orbit. We also obtained a
refined optical photometric orbit ephemeris, and observed variability of the
tidally distorted companion over 7 years. A hard X-ray light curve from NuSTAR
shows expected orbit-modulated emission from the intrabinary shock. The pulsar
parameters and photometric ephemeris greatly restrict the parameter space
required to search for a coherent timing solution including pulsar spin-down
rate, either using Fermi $\gamma$-rays, or further radio pulse detections.

problem in scientific computing and machine learning. Traditional approaches
like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) guarantee asymptotically unbiased samples
from such distributions but suffer from computational inefficiency,
particularly when dealing with high-dimensional targets, as they require
numerous iterations to generate a batch of samples. In this paper, we propose
an efficient and scalable neural implicit sampler that overcomes these
limitations. Our sampler can generate large batches of samples with low
computational costs by leveraging a neural transformation that directly maps
easily sampled latent vectors to target samples without the need for iterative
procedures. To train the neural implicit sampler, we introduce two novel
methods: the KL training method and the Fisher training method. The former
minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence, while the latter minimizes the
Fisher divergence. By employing these training methods, we effectively optimize
the neural implicit sampler to capture the desired target distribution. To
demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed
samplers, we evaluate them on three sampling benchmarks with different scales.
These benchmarks include sampling from 2D targets, Bayesian inference, and
sampling from high-dimensional energy-based models (EBMs). Notably, in the
experiment involving high-dimensional EBMs, our sampler produces samples that
are comparable to those generated by MCMC-based methods while being more than
100 times more efficient, showcasing the efficiency of our neural sampler. We
believe that the theoretical and empirical contributions presented in this work
will stimulate further research on developing efficient samplers for various
applications beyond the ones explored in this study.

matching methods lack explicit modeling of the above matching pattern. In this
work, we propose a fine-grained semantic matching method tailored for zero-shot

sentence-level similarity score into entity and context matching scores. Due to
the lack of explicit annotations of the redundant components, we design a
feature distillation module to adaptively identify the relation-irrelevant
features and reduce their negative impact on context matching. Experimental
results show that our method achieves higher matching $F_1$ score and has an

relevant for thermal management in emerging silicon carbide applications like
MEMS and optoelectronic devices. In such films k can be substantially reduced
by microstructure features including grain boundaries, thin film surfaces, and
porosity, while these microstructural effects can also be manipulated through
thermal annealing. Here, we investigate these effects by using microfabricated
suspended devices to measure the thermal conductivities of nine LPCVD silicon
carbide films of varying thickness (from 120 - 300 nm) and annealing conditions
(as-grown and annealed at 950 degrees Celsius and 1100 degrees Celsius for 2
hours, and in one case 17 hours). Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra and density measurements are also
used to characterize the effects of the annealing on the microstructure of
selected samples. Compared to as-deposited films, annealing at 1100 degrees
Celsius typically increases the estimated grain size from 5.5 nm to 6.6 nm
while decreasing the porosity from around 6.5% to practically fully dense. This
corresponds to a 34% increase in the measured thin film thermal conductivity
near room temperature, from 5.8 W/m-K to 7.8 W/m-K. These thermal conductivity
measurements show good agreement of better than 3% with fits using a simple
theoretical model based on kinetic theory combined with a Maxwell-Garnett
porosity correction. Grain boundary scattering plays the dominant role in
reducing the thermal conductivity of these films compared to bulk
single-crystal values, while both grain size increase and porosity decrease
play important roles in the partial k recovery of the films upon annealing.
This work demonstrates the effects of modifying the microstructure and thus the
thermal conductivity of silicon carbide thin films by thermal annealing.

significant problem: the lack of suitable and reliable large-scale temporal

existing temporal graph datasets are in small sizes, and even large-scale

is specified directly on the correction matrices. An infinite series

aerial manipulator that consists of a quadcopter flying base and a Delta arm.
We propose a novel partially decoupled motion planning framework to solve this
problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed one has two
novel features. First, it does not suffer from increased computation in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. That is because it calculates the
trajectories of the quadcopter base and the end-effector separately in the
Cartesian space based on proposed geometric feasibility constraints. The
geometric feasibility constraints can ensure the resulting trajectories satisfy
the aerial manipulator's geometry. Second, collision avoidance for the Delta
arm is achieved through an iterative approach based on a pinhole mapping
method, so that the feasible trajectory can be found in an efficient manner.
The proposed approach is verified by three experiments on a real aerial
manipulation platform. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the
proposed method for the aerial pick-and-place task.

building morphology having a significant impact on local climate patterns, air
quality, and overall urban microclimate. Understanding the heat and fluid flow
in complex urban environments is crucial for improving urban climate
resilience. In order to gain a better understanding of the physical processes
in urban areas, specifically in street canyons, we investigated simultaneous
heat and flow fields at high spatial and temporal resolutions using
Laser-induced Fluorescence (LIF) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV),
respectively. Our results of heat and flow in low-density urban models with a
site cover ratio and sky view factor of 0.21 and 0.6, respectively, indicate
that the flow is significantly influenced by a combination of factors,
including canyon configuration, the presence of buoyant force, and the
magnitude of the approaching flow. The ventilation rate and heat flux from the
street canyon, which are key factors shaping the urban microclimate, are found
dominated significantly by the street canyon morphology. For instance, changing
the aspect ratio of a street canyon results in a significant change of air
ventilation rate, ranging from as low as 0.02 to as high as 1.5 under the same
flow conditions. Additionally, canyons with high air ventilation rates exhibit
significant heat flux removal at the canyon roof level, which is accurately
described by the local Richardson number. These findings contribute to the
understanding of how the built environment affects the urban microclimate and
how this information can be used to improve the current city design that can be
better equipped to handle the challenges of urbanization and urban climate
resilience in a changing climate.

offer a solution. However, detecting unusual or difficult examples is notably
challenging, as it is impossible to anticipate all potential inputs at test

properties of $\alpha$-MoO$_{3}$ using the first-principles density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. From the formation energy calculations, it is
concluded that Mo vacancies are difficult to form in the system, while O and
Mo-O co-vacancies are energetically quite favorable. We further find that
vacancies give rise to mid-gap states (trap states) that remarkably affect the
magneto-optoelectronic properties of the material. Our calculations indicate
that a single Mo vacancy leads to half-metallic behavior, and also induces a
large magnetic moment of 5.98 $\mu_{B}$. On the other hand, for the single O
vacancy case, the band gap disappears completely, but the system remains in a
non-magnetic state. For Mo-O co-vacancies of two types considered in this work,
a reduced band gap is found, along with an induced magnetic moment of 2.0
$\mu_{B}$. Furthermore, a few finite peaks below the main band edge are
observed in the absorption spectra of configurations with Mo and O vacancies,
while they are absent in the Mo-O co-vacancies of both types, just like in the
pristine state. From the ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, stability
and sustainability of induced magnetic moment at room temperate is verified.
Our findings will enable the development of defect strategies that maximize the
functionality of the system, and further help in designing highly efficient
magneto-optoelectronic and spintronic devices.

attacker compromises malicious clients, and injects poisoned model weights into
the aggregation process to yield attacker-chosen predictions for particular
samples. Existing countermeasures, mainly based on anomaly detection, may
erroneously reject legitimate weights while accepting malicious ones, which is
due to inadequacies in quantifying client model similarities. Other defense
mechanisms prove effective exclusively when confronted with a restricted number
of malicious clients, e.g., less than 10%. To address these vulnerabilities, we
present G$^2$uardFL, a protective framework that reframes the detection of
malicious clients as an attributed graph clustering problem, thereby
safeguarding FL systems. This framework employs a client graph clustering
technique to identify malicious clients and incorporates an adaptive method to
amplify the disparity between the aggregated model and poisoned client models,
thereby eliminating previously embedded backdoors. A theoretical analysis of
convergence is also performed to demonstrate that the global model closely
approximates the model untouched by any backdoor. Through empirical evaluation
compared to cutting-edge defenses and against various backdoor attacks, our
experimental results indicate that G$^2$uardFL considerably undermines the
effectiveness of backdoor attacks while maintaining a negligible impact on the

error called Partitioned Calibration Error (PCE), revealing that the key

partitioning can extend beyond just the partitioning of prediction

semantic-related partitioning functions, we demonstrate that the relationship

for training a calibrated and accurate model. To validate the aforementioned
analysis, we propose a method that involves jointly learning a semantic aware

the ultraviolet (UV) range, where spin coating with hydrogen silsesquioxane

refractive index. Here, we report a comprehensive study on UV photodetectors

this material is efficient for passivating the nanowire surface, it introduces
a compressive strain in the nanowires and preserves their radiative efficiency.
We discuss the final performance of planarized UV photodetectors based on three
kinds of nanowire ensembles: (i) non-intentionally-doped (nid) GaN nanowires,
(ii) Ge-doped GaN nanowires, and (iii) nid GaN nanowires terminated with an
AlGaN/AlN superlattice. The incorporation of the superlattice allows tuning the
spectral response with bias, which can enhance the carrier collection from the
AlGaN/AlN superlattice or from the GaN stem. In all the cases, the performance
of the planarized devices remains determined by the nanowire nature, since
their characteristics in terms of linearity and spectral selectivity are closer
to those demonstrated in single nanowires than those of planar devices. Thus,
the visible rejection is several orders of magnitude and there is no indication

realistic data by employing multi-step denoising processes. However, the need
for accommodating significant variations in input noise at each time-step has
led to diffusion models requiring a large number of parameters for their
denoisers. We have observed that diffusion models effectively act as filters
for different frequency ranges at each time-step noise. While some previous
works have introduced multi-expert strategies, assigning denoisers to different
noise intervals, they overlook the importance of specialized operations for
high and low frequencies. For instance, self-attention operations are effective
at handling low-frequency components (low-pass filters), while convolutions
excel at capturing high-frequency features (high-pass filters). In other words,
existing diffusion models employ denoisers with the same architecture, without
considering the optimal operations for each time-step noise. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel approach called Multi-architecturE Multi-Expert
(MEME), which consists of multiple experts with specialized architectures
tailored to the operations required at each time-step interval. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MEME outperforms large competitors
in terms of both generation performance and computational efficiency.

To investigate this light compact star, a density-dependent relativistic
mean-field (DDRMF) model, specifically the DDVT model, has been employed. The
DDVT model incorporates tensor couplings of vector mesons, which {can}
successfully describe the properties of finite nuclei, such as charge radius,
binding energy, and spin-orbit splitting. The introduction of tensor coupling
reduces the influence of scalar mesons and generates a softer equation of state
(EOS) in the outer core of the neutron star. Moreover, it has been found that
the crust segment plays a crucial role in reproducing the mass-radius relation
of HESS J1731-347, indicating a preference for a soft crust EOS. By
manipulating the coupling strength of the isovector meson in the DDVT parameter
set, a reasonable hadronic EOS has been obtained, satisfying the constraints
from the gravitational-wave signal GW170817, the simultaneous mass-radius
measurements from the NICER collaboration, and the properties of finite nuclei.
Notably, the mass-radius relations derived from this hadronic EOS also
accurately describe the observables of HESS J1731-347. Therefore, based on our

restricted to the low corona, appearing as a confined eruption. The possible
causes of the confinement remain elusive. Here, we model the eruption of a
magnetic flux rope in a quadrupolar active region, with the parameters set such
that magnetic X-lines exist both below and above the rope. This facilitates the
onset of magnetic reconnection in either place but with partly opposing effects
on the eruption. The lower reconnection initially adds poloidal flux to the
rope, increasing the upward hoop force and supporting the rise of the rope.
However, when the flux of the magnetic side lobes enters the lower
reconnection, the flux rope is found to separate from the reconnection site and
the flux accumulation ceases. At the same time, the upper reconnection begins
to reduce the poloidal flux of the rope, decreasing its hoop force; eventually
this cuts the rope completely. The relative weight of the two reconnection
processes is varied in the model, and it is found that their combined effect
and the tension force of the overlying field confine the eruption if the flux
ratio of the outer to the inner polarities exceeds a threshold, which is about
1.3 for our Cartesian box and chosen parameters. We hence propose that external
reconnection between an erupting flux rope and overlying flux can play a vital
role in confining eruptions.

measure the ultrafast photoconductivity response of perovskite in a tunable

whether the cavity-phonon interaction affects the material electron-phonon

recommendation. An effective ranking model should give a personalized ranking
list for each user according to the user preference. Existing algorithms
usually extract a user representation vector from the user behavior sequence,
then feed the vector into a feed-forward network (FFN) together with other
features for feature interactions, and finally produce a personalized ranking
score. Despite tremendous progress in the past, there is still room for
improvement. Firstly, the personalized patterns of feature interactions for
different users are not explicitly modeled. Secondly, most of existing
algorithms have poor personalized ranking results for long-tail users with few
historical behaviors due to the data sparsity. To overcome the two challenges,
we propose Attention Weighted Mixture of Experts (AW-MoE) with contrastive
learning for personalized ranking. Firstly, AW-MoE leverages the MoE framework
to capture personalized feature interactions for different users. To model the
user preference, the user behavior sequence is simultaneously fed into expert
networks and the gate network. Within the gate network, one gate unit and one
activation unit are designed to adaptively learn the fine-grained activation
vector for experts using an attention mechanism. Secondly, a random masking
strategy is applied to the user behavior sequence to simulate long-tail users,
and an auxiliary contrastive loss is imposed to the output of the gate network
to improve the model generalization for these users. This is validated by a
higher performance gain on the long-tail user test set. Experiment results on a
JD real production dataset and a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness
of AW-MoE, which significantly outperforms state-of-art methods. Notably,
AW-MoE has been successfully deployed in the JD e-commerce search engine, ...

the structure of molecular clouds in these poorly studied subsolar metallicity

than 2km/s at half power, enabling detection of the HCN hyperfine structure in
the stronger sources and allowing us to observationally test hyperfine
collision rates. The hyperfine line ratios show that the HCN emission is
optically thin with column densities estimated at N(HCN)~$3x10^{12}$\scm. The
HCO$^+$ emission is approximately twice as strong as the HCN (taken as the sum
of all components), in contrast with the inner Galaxy and nearby galaxies where
they are similarly strong. For an abundance ratio $\chi_{HCN}/\chi_{HCO^+} =
3$, this requires a relatively low density solution for the dense gas, with
n(H2) $\sim 10^3 - 10^4$\ccm. The $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO line ratios are similar
to solar neighborhood values, roughly 7.5, despite the low $^{13}$CO abundance
expected at such large radii. The HCO$^+$/CO and HCO$^+$/$^{13}$CO integrated
intensity ratios are also standard at about 1/35 and 1/5 respectively. HCN is
weak compared to the CO emission, with HCN/CO $\sim 1/70$ even after summing
all hyperfine components. At the parsec scales observed here, the correlation
between star formation, as traced by 24~$\mu$m emission as is standard in
extragalactic work, and dense gas via the HCN or HCO$^+$ emission, is poor,
perhaps due to the lack of dynamic range. We find that the lowest dense gas

Across common filters, we robustly discover closures of the same form for
momentum and heat fluxes. These closures depend on nonlinear combinations of
gradients of filtered variables (velocity, temperature), with constants that
are independent of the fluid/flow properties and only depend on filter
type/size. We show that these closures are the nonlinear gradient model (NGM),
which is derivable analytically using Taylor-series expansions. In fact, we
suggest that with common (physics-free) equation-discovery algorithms,
regardless of the system/physics, discovered closures are always consistent
with the Taylor-series. Like previous studies, we find that large-eddy
simulations with NGM closures are unstable, despite significant similarities
between the true and NGM-predicted fluxes (pattern correlations $> 0.95$). We
identify two shortcomings as reasons for these instabilities: in 2D, NGM
produces zero kinetic energy transfer between resolved and subgrid scales,
lacking both diffusion and backscattering. In RBC, backscattering of potential
energy is poorly predicted. Moreover, we show that SGS fluxes diagnosed from
data, presumed the ""truth"" for discovery, depend on filtering procedures and
are not unique. Accordingly, to learn accurate, stable closures from
high-fidelity data in future work, we propose several ideas around using
physics-informed libraries, loss functions, and metrics. These findings are
relevant beyond turbulence to closure modeling of any multi-scale system.

proposes a Progression Cognition Reinforcement Learning with Prioritized
Experience for MVP (PEPCRL-MVP) in urban multi-intersection dynamic traffic

the global experience replay buffer according to the parameters of each MARL
agent. With the personalized and prioritized experience set selected via the
prioritization network, diversity is introduced to the learning process of
MARL, which can improve collaboration and task related performance.
Furthermore, PEPCRL-MVP employs an attention module to extract critical

develop progression cognition method to adaptively group pursuing vehicles.
Each group efficiently target one evading vehicle in dynamic driving

pore scale incomplete mixing is at play. Previous experimental studies
investigated chemical reactions in porous media by visualizing reaction product
or reactants mostly in uniform flow. However, the local reaction rate, which is
necessary to infer mechanisms of reaction in pore space, could not be obtained
without considering transport of reaction products and reactants. Thus, the
interpretation remained elusive. We visualized the reaction rate field using
chemiluminescnece within index-matched 3D porous media under zero acceleration
and constant acceleration flow fields to investigate how pore scale chaotic
mixing and Darcy scale fluid acceleration rectify reactive transport. We found
that the reaction rate kept increasing from upstream to downstream in constant
acceleration field, whereas it increased only at the upstream zone in zero
acceleration field. The ratio of dispersion rate and size of the mixing
interface determined such an effect of acceleration. Moreover, the experimental
results showed stronger dependency of reaction rate on velocity compared to the
numerical simulations that assume complete mixing in pore space. To explain
this, we suggested the mechanistic model that includes the pore scale folding
of lamellae due to chaotic mixing and the pore scale concentration gradients
against compression. Such a pore scale mechanism was consistent with the
experimentally observed change in reaction rate over the space. These results
give new insights on underlying mechanisms of reactive transport in porous
media.

VAEs performance, the theory for posterior collapse remains underdeveloped,

understanding of posterior collapse to two important and prevalent yet less

via a non-trivial theoretical analysis of linear conditional VAEs and
hierarchical VAEs with two levels of latent, we prove that the cause of
posterior collapses in these models includes the correlation between the input

computational resources to discover optimal architectures for a single task,
which makes them impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these

considers the consistency across features, parameters, and gradients of both
clean and perturbed images at the initialization state. Our approach
facilitates an efficient and rapid search for neural architectures capable of
learning generalizable features that exhibit robustness across diverse

and efficiently search for neural architectures that are consistently robust
against various perturbations on multiple benchmark datasets and diverse search
spaces, largely outperforming existing clean zero-shot NAS and robust NAS with

time series tasks, Long-Term Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks have also received
extensive attention in recent years. However, due to the inherent computational
complexity and long sequences demanding of Transformer-based methods, its
application on LTSF tasks still has two major issues that need to be further
investigated: 1) Whether the sparse attention mechanism designed by these
methods actually reduce the running time on real devices; 2) Whether these
models need extra long input sequences to guarantee their performance? The
answers given in this paper are negative. Therefore, to better copy with these
two issues, we design a lightweight Period-Attention mechanism (Periodformer),
which renovates the aggregation of long-term subseries via explicit periodicity
and short-term subseries via built-in proximity. Meanwhile, a gating mechanism
is embedded into Periodformer to regulate the influence of the attention module
on the prediction results. Furthermore, to take full advantage of GPUs for fast
hyperparameter optimization (e.g., finding the suitable input length), a
Multi-GPU Asynchronous parallel algorithm based on Bayesian Optimization (MABO)
is presented. MABO allocates a process to each GPU via a queue mechanism, and
then creates multiple trials at a time for asynchronous parallel search, which
greatly reduces the search time. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods,
the prediction error of Periodformer reduced by 13% and 26% for multivariate
and univariate forecasting, respectively. In addition, MABO reduces the average
search time by 46% while finding better hyperparameters. As a conclusion, this
paper indicates that LTSF may not need complex attention and extra long input
sequences. The source code will be open source on Github.

transition network, which predicts the next expected latent state given current
state-action pairs. Experimental studies are conducted using the Mountain Car
environment from the OpenAI gym suite, to study the effect of the various
Hebbian network parameters on the task performance. It is shown that the
proposed Hebbian AIF approach outperforms the use of Q-learning, while not
requiring any replay buffer, as in typical reinforcement learning systems.
These results motivate further investigations of Hebbian learning for the

  Recently, Conlon, Fox and Wigderson (2023) conjecture that for any

some constant $\beta=\beta(\alpha)>0$ such that $r(B_{\lceil\alpha

This conjecture clearly holds for every $\alpha< 1/6$ from an early result of
Nikiforov and Rousseau (2005), i.e., for every $\alpha< 1/6$ and large $n$,
$r(B_{\lceil\alpha n\rceil},B_n)=2n+3$.
  We disprove the conjecture of Conlon et al. (2023). Indeed, we show that the

$r(B_{\lceil\alpha n\rceil}, B_n)\le\left(\frac 32+3\alpha\right) n+o(n)$,
where the inequality is asymptotically tight when $\alpha=1/6$ or $1/4$. We
also give a lower bound of $r(B_{\lceil\alpha n\rceil}, B_n)$ for
$1/6\le\alpha< \frac{52-16\sqrt{3}}{121}\approx0.2007$, showing that the random

understanding such as autonomous driving. In this work, we devise an efficient

estimation. Simply sharing the same visual feature representations for these
tasks impairs the performance of tasks, while independent task-specific feature
extractors lead to parameter redundancy and latency. Thus, we design two
feature-merge branches to learn feature basis, which can be useful to, and thus
shared by, multiple perception tasks. Then, each task takes the corresponding
feature basis as the input of the prediction task head to fulfill a specific
task. In particular, one feature merge branch is designed for instance-level
recognition the other for dense predictions. To enhance inter-branch
communication, the instance branch passes pixel-wise spatial information of
each instance to the dense branch using efficient dynamic convolution
weighting. Moreover, a simple but effective dynamic routing mechanism is
proposed to isolate task-specific features and leverage common properties among
tasks. Our proposed framework, termed D2BNet, demonstrates a unique approach to
parameter-efficient predictions for multi-task perception. In addition, as
tasks benefit from co-training with each other, our solution achieves on par

densities. Our aim is to develop a machine learning classifier that can
efficiently and reliably separate AGNs and SFGs in radio continuum surveys. We
perform supervised classification of SFGs vs AGNs using the Light Gradient
Boosting Machine (LGBM) on three LOFAR Deep Fields (Lockman Hole, Bootes and
ELAIS-N1), which benefit from a wide range of high-quality multi-wavelength
data and classification labels derived from extensive spectral energy
distribution (SED) analyses. Our trained model has a precision of 0.92(0.01)
and a recall of 0.87(0.02) for SFGs. For AGNs, the model has slightly worse
performance, with a precision of 0.87(0.02) and recall of 0.78(0.02). These
results demonstrate that our trained model can successfully reproduce the
classification labels derived from detailed SED analysis. The model performance
decreases towards higher redshifts, mainly due to smaller training sample
sizes. To make the classifier more adaptable to other radio galaxy surveys, we
also investigate how our classifier performs with a poorer multi-wavelength
sampling of the SED. In particular, we find that the far-infrared (FIR) and
radio bands are of great importance. We also find that higher S/N in some

setting ranges from interventions related to criminal justice and welfare, all
the way to clinical decision-making and public health. In this paper, we first
analyze through causal lenses the notion of benefit, which captures how much a

notion of benefit fairness, which can be seen as the minimal fairness

Although VPT has demonstrated its applicability with supervised vision

on the ViT blocks with which the prompt tokens interact. Specifically, VPT
shows improved performance on image classification tasks for MAE and MoCo v3

knowledge of pretrained language models. These benchmarks (e.g., LAMA, and
ParaRel) are mainly developed in English and later are translated to form new
multilingual versions (e.g., mLAMA, and mParaRel). Results on these
multilingual benchmarks suggest that using English prompts to recall the facts
from multilingual models usually yields significantly better and more
consistent performance than using non-English prompts. Our analysis shows that
mLAMA is biased toward facts from Western countries, which might affect the
fairness of probing models. We propose a new framework for curating factual
triples from Wikidata that are culturally diverse. A new benchmark DLAMA-v1 is
built of factual triples from three pairs of contrasting cultures having a
total of 78,259 triples from 20 relation predicates. The three pairs comprise
facts representing the (Arab and Western), (Asian and Western), and (South
American and Western) countries respectively. Having a more balanced benchmark
(DLAMA-v1) supports that mBERT performs better on Western facts than
non-Western ones, while monolingual Arabic, English, and Korean models tend to
perform better on their culturally proximate facts. Moreover, both monolingual

extensively studied in the past. It has been shown that an external language
model, trained on additional target-side monolingual data, can help improve
translation quality. However, there has always been the assumption that the
translation model also learns an implicit target-side language model during
training, which interferes with the external language model at decoding time.
Recently, some works on automatic speech recognition have demonstrated that, if
the implicit language model is neutralized in decoding, further improvements
can be gained when integrating an external language model. In this work, we
transfer this concept to the task of machine translation and compare with the
most prominent way of including additional monolingual data - namely
back-translation. We find that accounting for the implicit language model
significantly boosts the performance of language model fusion, although this

  This paper reports a case study about the impact of digitalisation in remote
mountain areas, in the context of a system for ordinary land management and
hydro-geological risk control. The elicitation process was based on interviews
and workshops. In the initial phase, past and present impacts were identified.
In a second phase, future impacts were forecasted through the discussion of two
alternative scenarios: a dystopic, technology-intensive one, and a
technology-balanced one. The approach was particularly effective in identifying
negative impacts.
  Among them, we highlight the higher stress due to the excess of connectivity,
the partial reduction of decision-making abilities, and the risk of
marginalisation for certain types of stakeholders. The study posits that before
the elicitation of system goals, requirements engineers need to identify the
socio-economic impacts of ICT technologies included in the system, as negative
effects need to be properly mitigated. Our study contributes to the literature
with: a set of impacts specific to the case, which can apply to similar
contexts; an effective approach for impact elicitation; and a list of lessons

larger than that observed by THINGS, which is accompanied by an HI filament and
seven HVCs (high velocity clouds) at different distances. The projected
distances of these clouds and filament are less than 50 kpc from the galactic

127.3 ($\pm$1) Jy km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a H I mass of
(6.51$\pm$0.06)$\times$10$^{8}$M$_{\odot}$, which is 63.0% more than that

number to summarize how similar the sentence encoder's decision is to humans'.
However, it is unclear what kind of sentence pairs a sentence encoder (SE)
would consider similar. Moreover, existing SE benchmarks mainly consider
sentence pairs with low lexical overlap, so it is unclear how the SEs behave
when two sentences have high lexical overlap. We introduce a high-quality SE
diagnostic dataset, HEROS. HEROS is constructed by transforming an original
sentence into a new sentence based on certain rules to form a \textit{minimal
pair}, and the minimal pair has high lexical overlaps. The rules include
replacing a word with a synonym, an antonym, a typo, a random word, and
converting the original sentence into its negation. Different rules yield
different subsets of HEROS. By systematically comparing the performance of over
60 supervised and unsupervised SEs on HEROS, we reveal that most unsupervised
sentence encoders are insensitive to negation. We find the datasets used to
train the SE are the main determinants of what kind of sentence pairs an SE
considers similar. We also show that even if two SEs have similar performance
on STS benchmarks, they can have very different behavior on HEROS. Our result
reveals the blind spot of traditional STS benchmarks when evaluating SEs.

covering the CaII triplet region. In the next Gaia data releases, we anticipate
the number of RVS spectra to successively increase from several 10 million
spectra to eventually more than 200M spectra. Thus, stellar spectra are
produced on an ""industrial scale"" with numbers well above those for current and
anticipated ground based surveys. However, many of these spectra have low S/N
(from 15 to 25 per pixel), such that they pose problems for classical spectral
analysis pipelines and therefore alternative ways to tap into these large
datasets need to be devised. We aim to leverage the versatility/capabilities of
machine learning techniques for supercharged stellar parametrization, by
combining Gaia RVS spectra with the full set of Gaia products and
high-resolution, high-quality spectroscopic reference data sets. We develop a
hybrid Convolutional Neural-Network (CNN) which combines the Gaia DR3 RVS
spectra, photometry (G, Bp, Rp), parallaxes, and XP coefficients to derive
atmospheric parameters (Teff, log(g), and overall [M/H]) and chemical
abundances ([Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/M]). We trained the CNN with a high-quality
training sample based on APOGEE DR17 labels. With this CNN, we derived
homogeneous atmospheric parameters and abundances for 841300 stars, that
remarkably compared to external data-sets. The CNN is robust against noise in
the RVS data, and very precise labels are derived down to S/N=15. We managed to
characterize the [$\alpha$/M]-[M/H] bimodality from the inner regions to the
outer parts of the Milky Way, which has never been done using RVS spectra or
similar datasets. This work is the first to combine machine-learning with such
diverse datasets (spectroscopy, astrometry, and photometry), and paves the way
for the large scale machine-learning analysis of Gaia-RVS spectra from future

establishing such a benchmark is not a trivial task due to the challenges

PandaLM's focus extends beyond just the objective correctness of responses,
which is the main focus of traditional evaluation datasets. It addresses vital
subjective factors such as relative conciseness, clarity, adherence to
instructions, comprehensiveness, and formality. To ensure the reliability of
PandaLM, we collect a diverse human-annotated test dataset, where all contexts
are generated by humans and labels are aligned with human preferences. Our
results indicate that PandaLM-7B achieves 93.75% of GPT-3.5's evaluation
ability and 88.28% of GPT-4's in terms of F1-score on our test dataset. PandaLM
enables the evaluation of LLM to be fairer but with less cost, evidenced by
significant improvements achieved by models tuned through PandaLM compared to

PandaLM does not depend on API-based evaluations, thus avoiding potential data
leakage. All resources of PandaLM are released at

automate tasks and power new applications, there have been concerns that such
white-box access to its parameters, as opposed to the black-box setting which
only provides query access to the model, increases the attack surface. Directly
extending the shadow modelling technique from the black-box to the white-box
setting has been shown, in general, not to perform better than black-box only
attacks. A key reason is misalignment, a known characteristic of deep neural
networks. We here present the first systematic analysis of the causes of
misalignment in shadow models and show the use of a different weight
initialisation to be the main cause of shadow model misalignment. Second, we
extend several re-alignment techniques, previously developed in the model
fusion literature, to the shadow modelling context, where the goal is to
re-align the layers of a shadow model to those of the target model.We show
re-alignment techniques to significantly reduce the measured misalignment
between the target and shadow models. Finally, we perform a comprehensive
evaluation of white-box membership inference attacks (MIA). Our analysis
reveals that (1) MIAs suffer from misalignment between shadow models, but that
(2) re-aligning the shadow models improves, sometimes significantly, MIA
performance. On the CIFAR10 dataset with a false positive rate of 1\%,
white-box MIA using re-aligned shadow models improves the true positive rate by

with photometric monitoring during $\simeq$55 years and with a high-cadence
Kepler light curve lasting 81 days. METHODS: The data obtained in the V and I
bands were reduced with standard photometric methods. The Kepler data were
divided into subsamples and analyses with the Lomb-Scargle algorithm. RESULTS:
The V and I band light curves showed a phenomenon never before observed with
such recurrence in any symbiotic system, namely short outbursts, starting
between orbital phase 0.3 and 0.5 and lasting about a month, with a fast rise
and a slower decline, and amplitude of 0.5-1 mag. In the Kepler light curve we
discovered three frequencies with sidebands. We attribute a stable frequency of
127.5 d$^{-1}$ (corresponding to an 11.3 minutes period) to the white dwarf
rotation. We suggest that this detection probably implies that the white dwarf
accretes through a magnetic stream, like in intermediate polars. The small
outbursts may be ascribed to the stream-disc interaction. Another possibility
is that they are due to localized thermonuclear burning, perhaps confined by
the magnetic field, like recently inferred in intermediate polars, albeit on
different timescales. We measured also a second frequency around 116.9 d$^{-1}$
(corresponding to about 137 minutes), which is much less stable and has a
drift. It may be due to rocky detritus around the white dwarf, but it is more
likely to be caused by an inhomogeneity in the accretion disk. Finally, there
is a third frequency close to the first one that appears to correspond to the
beating between the rotation and the second frequency.

derivative of HEE with respect to the lattice wave number that effectively
characterizes the quantum phase transition (QPT). This distinction arises due
to the influence of thermal effects. These findings present novel insights into

negative samples and the regularizer may hinder learning new distinctive
representations. To that end, we propose Sy-CON that consists of two losses
(one for plasticity and the other for stability) with symmetric dependence on
current and past models' negative sample embeddings. We argue our model can
naturally find good trade-off between the plasticity and stability without any

the power law in the undisturbed medium with distance from the symmetry axis.
To obtain the similarity solution, the initial density is considered as
constant in the undisturbed medium. Approximate analytical solutions are
obtained using Sakurai's method by extending the power series of the flow
variables in power of ${\left( {\frac{{{a_0}}}{U}} \right)^2}$, where $U$ and
$a_0$ are the speeds of the shock and sound, respectively, in undisturbed
fluid. The strong shock wave is considered for the ratio ${\left(

With the aid of that method, the closed-form solutions for the zeroth-order
approximation is given as well as first-order approximate solutions are
discussed. Also, with the help of graphs behind the blast wave for the
zeroth-order approximation, the distributions of variables such as density,
radial velocity, pressure and azimuthal fluid velocity are analyzed. The
results for the rotationally axisymmetric non-ideal gas environment are
compared to those for the ideal gas atmosphere.

data privacy issues that can arise in the traditional machine learning
paradigm. While FL ensures that a user's data always remain with the user, the
gradients of the locally trained models must be communicated with the
centralized server to build the global model. This results in privacy leakage,
where the server can infer private information of the users' data from the
shared gradients. To mitigate this flaw, the next-generation FL architectures
proposed encryption and anonymization techniques to protect the model updates
from the server. However, this approach creates other challenges, such as a
malicious user might sabotage the global model by sharing false gradients.
Since the gradients are encrypted, the server is unable to identify and
eliminate rogue users which would protect the global model. Therefore, to
mitigate both attacks, this paper proposes a novel fully homomorphic encryption
(FHE) based scheme suitable for FL. We modify the one-to-one single-key
Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS)-based FHE scheme into a distributed multi-key
additive homomorphic encryption scheme that supports model aggregation in FL.
We employ a novel aggregation scheme within the encrypted domain, utilizing
users' non-poisoning rates, to effectively address data poisoning attacks while
ensuring privacy is preserved by the proposed encryption scheme. Rigorous
security, privacy, convergence, and experimental analyses have been provided to
show that FheFL is novel, secure, and private, and achieves comparable accuracy

in this field primarily frames this problem as a machine learning task,
focusing on developing models that achieve high classification performance in

provide ground truth information. However, agreement between annotators is
often low, leading to inconsistent labels that hinder the reliability of

summing up the requirements with certain preference weights. Existing
final-stage ranking methods often adopt a static model where the preference

semi-automatically verified to hold for the ISA operational semantics,
producing a high-assurance mechanically-verifiable proof, and (3) support
informal and formal reasoning about security-critical software in the presence

contracts that express bounds on the authority of arbitrary untrusted code.
Universal contracts can be kept agnostic of software abstractions, and strike
the right balance between requiring sufficient detail for reasoning about
software and preserving implementation freedom of ISA designers and CPU
implementers. We semi-automatically verify universal contracts against Sail
implementations of ISA semantics using our Katamaran tool; a semi-automatic

successfully verified contracts. We demonstrate the generality of our method by

so, it learns to extract foreground counting knowledge without interference

limits on (or indirect detection of) the IGMF can be obtained from observations

extragalactic background light to produce electron-positron pairs, which can
subsequently initiate electromagnetic cascades. The $\gamma$-ray signature of
the cascade depends on the IGMF since it deflects the pairs. Here we report on

method based on octree to solve these difficulties. In our approach, scientific
data is preprocessed before training, and a hierarchical octree-based data
structure is built to guide sampling on the latent context grid. Each leaf node
in the octree corresponds to an indivisible subblock of the volumetric data.
The dimensions of the subblocks are different, making the number of sample
points in each randomly cropped training data block to be adaptive. We
reconstruct the octree at intervals according to loss distribution to perform
the multi-stage training. With the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection problem, we
deploy our method to state-of-the-art models. We constructed adequate
experiments to evaluate the training performance and model accuracy of our
method. Experiments indicate that our sampling optimization improves the
convergence performance of physics-constrained deep learning super-resolution
solutions. Furthermore, the sample points and training time are significantly
reduced with no drop in model accuracy. We also test our method in training
tasks of other deep neural networks, and the results show our sampling
optimization has extensive effectiveness and applicability. The code is

fragile. In this work, we show that, by employing chiral optical cavities, the
topological flat bands can be stabilized away from the magic angle in an

simplified theoretical model, time reversal symmetry breaking, induced by the
chiral nature of the cavity, plays a fundamental role in flattening the
isolated bands and gapping out the rest of the spectrum. The efficiency of the
cavity is discussed as a function of the twisting angle, the light-matter

also be obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The solution requires
handling infinite matrices in Matsubara frequency space. This is commonly
treated using a finite frequency cut-off, resulting in slow linear convergence.
We show that decomposing the two-particle response in local and non-local
contributions enables a reformulation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation inspired
by the dual boson formalism. The re-formulation has a drastically improved
cubic convergence with respect to the frequency cut-off, facilitating the
calculation of susceptibilities in multi-orbital systems considerably. The dual
Bethe-Salpeter equation uses the fully reducible vertex which is free from
vertex divergences. We benchmark the approach on several systems including the
spin susceptibility of strontium ruthenate Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, a strongly correlated

utilized not only for generating fixed-size images but also for creating
panoramas. However, naive stitching of multiple images often results in visible
seams. Recent techniques have attempted to address this issue by performing
joint diffusions in multiple windows and averaging latent features in
overlapping regions. However, these approaches, which focus on seamless montage
generation, often yield incoherent outputs by blending different scenes within
a single image. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncDiffusion, a
plug-and-play module that synchronizes multiple diffusions through gradient
descent from a perceptual similarity loss. Specifically, we compute the
gradient of the perceptual loss using the predicted denoised images at each
denoising step, providing meaningful guidance for achieving coherent montages.
Our experimental results demonstrate that our method produces significantly
more coherent outputs compared to previous methods (66.35% vs. 33.65% in our
user study) while still maintaining fidelity (as assessed by GIQA) and
compatibility with the input prompt (as measured by CLIP score).

  Large Language Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Despite the existence of various benchmarks for evaluating natural language
processing models, we argue that human exams are a more suitable means of
evaluating general intelligence for large language models (LLMs), as they
inherently demand a much wider range of abilities such as language
understanding, domain knowledge, and problem-solving skills. To this end, we
introduce M3Exam, a novel benchmark sourced from real and official human exam
questions for evaluating LLMs in a multilingual, multimodal, and multilevel
context. M3Exam exhibits three unique characteristics: (1) multilingualism,
encompassing questions from multiple countries that require strong multilingual
proficiency and cultural knowledge; (2) multimodality, accounting for the
multimodal nature of many exam questions to test the model's multimodal
understanding capability; and (3) multilevel structure, featuring exams from
three critical educational periods to comprehensively assess a model's
proficiency at different levels. In total, M3Exam contains 12,317 questions in
9 diverse languages with three educational levels, where about 23\% of the
questions require processing images for successful solving. We assess the
performance of top-performing LLMs on M3Exam and find that current models,
including GPT-4, still struggle with multilingual text, particularly in
low-resource and non-Latin script languages. Multimodal LLMs also perform
poorly with complex multimodal questions. We believe that M3Exam can be a
valuable resource for comprehensively evaluating LLMs by examining their
multilingual and multimodal abilities and tracking their development. Data and
evaluation code is available at \url{https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/M3Exam}.

learning regression problems by isotonic regression might present a problem for
bin-based calibration error statistics (e.g. ENCE). Isotonic regression often
produces stratified uncertainties, i.e. subsets of uncertainties with identical
numerical values. Partitioning of the resulting data into equal-sized bins
introduces an aleatoric component to the estimation of bin-based calibration
statistics. The partitioning of stratified data into bins depends on the order
of the data, which is typically an uncontrolled property of calibration
test/validation sets. The tie-braking method of the ordering algorithm used for
binning might also introduce an aleatoric component. I show on an example how
this might significantly affect the calibration diagnostics.

improve the translation consistency and cohesion, the translation of ambiguous
inputs, as well as several other linguistic phenomena. Many works have been
published on the topic of document-level NMT, but most restrict the system to
only local context, typically including just the one or two preceding sentences
as additional information. This might be enough to resolve some ambiguous
inputs, but it is probably not sufficient to capture some document-level
information like the topic or style of a conversation. When increasing the
context size beyond just the local context, there are two challenges: (i)
the~memory usage increases exponentially (ii) the translation performance
starts to degrade. We argue that the widely-used attention mechanism is
responsible for both issues. Therefore, we propose a constrained attention
variant that focuses the attention on the most relevant parts of the sequence,
while simultaneously reducing the memory consumption. For evaluation, we
utilize targeted test sets in combination with novel evaluation techniques to
analyze the translations in regards to specific discourse-related phenomena. We
find that our approach is a good compromise between sentence-level NMT vs
attending to the full context, especially in low resource scenarios.

works, we consider this identification problem in a low-regularity regime in
which the function inducing the Nemytskii operator is a-priori only known to be
an element of $H^1_{loc}(\mathbb{R})$. This makes the studied problem class a
suitable point of departure for the rigorous analysis of training problems for
learning-informed PDEs in which an unknown superposition operator is
approximated by means of a neural network with nonsmooth activation functions

minimizers and to solve the considered problem by means of a gradient
projection method. The convergence of the resulting algorithm is proven in the
function space setting. It is also shown that the established first-order
necessary optimality conditions imply that locally optimal superposition
operators share various characteristic properties with commonly used activation

when the gradients provided by a limited number of examples are uninformative.
We prove theoretically that our algorithm converges for smooth, strongly convex
objectives. EMO is generic, flexible, and model-agnostic, making it a simple
plug-and-play optimizer that can be seamlessly embedded into existing

this article, we aim to determine whether any transition region response can be
detected for small-scale EUV brightenings and, if so, to identify whether the
measured spectra correspond to any previously reported bursts in the transition
region, such as Explosive Events (EEs). EUV brightenings were detected in a
~29.4 minute dataset sampled by Solar Orbiter's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on 8
March 2022 using an automated detection algorithm. Any potential transition
region response was inferred through analysis of imaging and spectral data
sampled through coordinated observations conducted by the Interface Region
Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). EUV brightenings display a range of responses in
IRIS slit-jaw imager (SJI) data. Some events have clear signatures in the Mg II
and Si IV SJI filters, whilst others have no discernible counterpart. Both
extended and more complex EUV brightenings are found to, sometimes, have
responses in IRIS SJI data. Examples of EUI intensities peaking before, during,
and after their IRIS counterparts were found in lightcurves constructed
co-spatial to EUV brightenings. Importantly, therefore, it is likely that not
all EUV brightenings are driven in the same way, with some seemingly being
magnetic reconnection driven and others not. A single EUV brightening occurred
co-spatial to the IRIS slit, with its spectra matching the properties of EEs.
EUV brightenings is a term used to describe a range of small-scale event in the
solar corona. The physics responsible for all EUV brightenings is likely not
the same and, therefore, more research is required to assess their importance
towards global questions in the field, such as coronal heating.

Hermitian (or non-Hermitian) systems with real (or imaginary) fields, we can
obtain real (or imaginary) WS ladders in the eigenenergy spectrum. In most
cases with $q \geq 2$, there are multiple WS ladders with all the eigenstates
localized in the strong field limit. However, in the lattices with $q=4$, the
energy-dependent localization phenomenon emerges due to the competition between
spatially periodic and linearly increasing behaviors in the onsite potential.
About half the number of eigenstates are gathered at the band center and can
extend over a wide region or even the full range of the lattice, even when the
field becomes very strong. Moreover, in the non-Hermitian lattices with odd
$q$, some of the WS ladders become doubly degenerate, where the eigenstates are
evenly distributed at two neighboring sites in a wide regime of field strength.

through Speed and Separation Monitoring (SSM), as defined in ISO standard
ISO/TS 15066. In general, it is impossible to avoid all human-robot collisions:
consider for instance the case when the robot does not move at all, a human
operator can still collide with it by hitting it of her own voluntary motion.
In the SSM framework, it is possible however to minimize harm by requiring
this: \emph{if} a collision ever occurs, then the robot must be in a
\emph{stationary state} (all links have zero velocity) at the time instant of
the collision. In this paper, we propose a time-optimal control policy based on
Time-Optimal Path Parameterization (TOPP) to guarantee such a behavior.
Specifically, we show that: for any robot motion that is strictly faster than
the motion recommended by our policy, there exists a human motion that results
in a collision with the robot in a non-stationary state. Correlatively, we
show, in simulation, that our policy is strictly less conservative than
state-of-the-art safe robot control methods. Additionally, we propose a
parallelization method to reduce the computation time of our pre-computation
phase (down to 0.5 sec, practically), which enables the whole pipeline
(including the pre-computation) to be executed at runtime, nearly in real-time.
Finally, we demonstrate the application of our method in a scenario:
time-optimal, safe control of a 6-dof industrial robot.

flow cell to produce freshwater (<17.1 mM NaCl) from concentrated brackish
water (118mM), to produce effluent near freshwater salinity (19.1 mM) from
influent with seawater-level salinity (496 mM), and to reduce the salinity of
hypersaline brine from 781 mM to 227 mM. These remarkable salt-removal levels
were enabled by using flow-through electrodes with high areal-loading of nickel
hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) Prussian Blue analogue intercalation material. The
pumping energy consumption due to flow-through electrodes was mitigated by
embedding an interdigitated array of <100 $\mu$m wide channels in the
electrodes using laser micromachining. The micron-scale dimensions of the
resulting embedded, micro-interdigitated flow fields (e$\mu$-IDFFs) facilitate
flow-through electrodes with high apparent permeability while minimizing
active-material loss. Our modeling shows that these e$\mu$-IDFFs are more
suitable for our intercalation electrodes because they have >100X lower
permeability compared to common redox-flow battery electrodes, for which
millimetric flow-channel widths were used exclusively in the past. Total
desalination thermodynamic energy efficiency (TEE) was improved by more than
ten-fold relative to unpatterned electrodes: 40.0% TEE for brackish water,
11.7% TEE for hypersaline brine, and 7.4% TEE for seawater-salinity feeds.
Water transport between diluate and brine streams and charge efficiency losses
resulting from (electro)chemical effects are implicated as limiting energy

current bounds to the quadratic one by 17 orders of magnitude. MDRs with larger
implications in the infrared, however, can be tightly constrained in the
nonrelativistic regime. We use the ensuing deviation from the equivalence

few hundred GeV scale whilst electroweak gauginos inhabit the TeV scale and the
heavy Higgs bosons, H, A and H^\pm could range up tens of TeV without
jeopardizing naturalness. For TeV-scale heavy SUSY Higgs bosons H, A and H^\pm,
as currently required by LHC searches, SUSY decays into gaugino plus higgsino
can dominate H^\pm decays provided these decays are kinematically accessible.
The visible decay products of higgsinos are soft making them largely invisible,
whilst the gauginos decay to W, Z or h plus missing transverse energy (MET).
Charged Higgs bosons are dominantly produced at LHC14 via the parton
subprocess, gb-> H^\pm t. In this paper, we examine the viability of observing
signtures from H^\pm -> \tau\nu, H^\pm -> tb and H^\pm -> W, Z, h + MET events
produced in association with a top quark at the HL-LHC over large Standard
Model (SM) backgrounds from (mainly) t\bar{t}, t\bar{t}V and t\bar{t}h
production (where V=W, Z). We find that the greatest reach is found via the SM
H^\pm(-> \tau\nu) +t channel with a subdominant contribution from the H^\pm(->
tb) +t channel. Unlike for neutral Higgs searches, the SUSY decay modes appear
to be unimportant for H^\pm searches at the HL-LHC. We delineate regions of the
m_A vs. \tan\beta plane, mostly around m_A \sim 1-2 TeV, where signals from
charged Higgs bosons would serve to confirm signals of a heavy, neutral Higgs

inference attacks against diffusion models, in which adversaries aim to extract
sensitive global properties of the training set from a diffusion model, such as
the proportion of the training data for certain sensitive properties.
Specifically, we consider the most practical attack scenario: adversaries are
only allowed to obtain synthetic data. Under this realistic scenario, we
evaluate the property inference attacks on different types of samplers and
diffusion models. A broad range of evaluations shows that various diffusion
models and their samplers are all vulnerable to property inference attacks.
Furthermore, one case study on off-the-shelf pre-trained diffusion models also
demonstrates the effectiveness of the attack in practice. Finally, we propose a
new model-agnostic plug-in method PriSampler to mitigate the property inference
of diffusion models. PriSampler can be directly applied to well-trained
diffusion models and support both stochastic and deterministic sampling.
Extensive experiments illustrate the effectiveness of our defense and it makes

PriSampler also shows its significantly superior performance to diffusion

  in anisotropic cosmologies",,,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is shown that any cosmological anisotropic model produces supersymmetric
theories for both massless scalar and electromagnetic fields. This
supersymmetric theory is the time-domain analogue of a supersymmetric quantum
mechanical theory. In this case, the variations of the anisotropic scale
factors of the Universe are responsible for triggering the supersymmetry. For
scalar fields, the superpartner fields evolve in two different cosmological
scenarios (Universes). On the other hand, for propagating electromagnetic
fields, supersymmetry is manifested through its polarization degrees of freedom
in one Universe. In this case, polarization degrees of freedom of
electromagnetic waves, which are orthogonal to its propagation direction,
become superpartners from each other. This behavior can be measured, for
example, through the rotation of the plane of polarization of cosmological
light.

  Its Application to Verification of Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the characteristics of neural networks is important but
difficult due to their complex structures and behaviors. Some previous work
proposes to transform neural networks into equivalent Boolean expressions and
apply verification techniques for characteristics of interest. This approach is
promising since rich results of verification techniques for circuits and other
Boolean expressions can be readily applied. The bottleneck is the time
complexity of the transformation. More precisely, (i) each neuron of the
network, i.e., a linear threshold function, is converted to a Binary Decision
Diagram (BDD), and (ii) they are further combined into some final form, such as
Boolean circuits. For a linear threshold function with $n$ variables, an
existing method takes $O(n2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ time to construct an ordered BDD of
size $O(2^{\frac{n}{2}})$ consistent with some variable ordering. However, it
is non-trivial to choose a variable ordering producing a small BDD among $n!$
candidates.
  We propose a method to convert a linear threshold function to a specific form
of a BDD based on the boosting approach in the machine learning literature. Our
method takes $O(2^n \text{poly}(1/\rho))$ time and outputs BDD of size
$O(\frac{n^2}{\rho^4}\ln{\frac{1}{\rho}})$, where $\rho$ is the margin of some
consistent linear threshold function. Our method does not need to search for
good variable orderings and produces a smaller expression when the margin of
the linear threshold function is large. More precisely, our method is based on
our new boosting algorithm, which is of independent interest. We also propose a
method to combine them into the final Boolean expression representing the
neural network.

obtain N(OH)/N(H2) = (1.32+/-0.15) x 10$^{-7}$, which is ~ 33 per cent higher

In this work, inspired by the fact that flat local minima are correlated with
good generalization, we assume and empirically validate that adversarial
examples at a flat local region tend to have good transferability by
introducing a penalized gradient norm to the original loss function. Since
directly optimizing the gradient regularization norm is computationally
expensive and intractable for generating adversarial examples, we propose an
approximation optimization method to simplify the gradient update of the
objective function. Specifically, we randomly sample an example and adopt the
first-order gradient to approximate the second-order Hessian matrix, which
makes computing more efficient by interpolating two Jacobian matrices.
Meanwhile, in order to obtain a more stable gradient direction, we randomly
sample multiple examples and average the gradients of these examples to reduce
the variance due to random sampling during the iterative process. Extensive
experimental results on the ImageNet-compatible dataset show that the proposed
method can generate adversarial examples at flat local regions, and
significantly improve the adversarial transferability on either normally

which is innermost to a nested family of upper or lower meander arcs. The
Chafee-Infante paradigm of 1974, with cubic nonlinearity $f=f(u)$, features
just two noses.
  We present, and fully prove, a precise description of global PDE connection
graphs, graded by Morse index, for such gradient-like Morse-Smale systems
\eqref{eq:*}. The directed edges denote PDE heteroclinic orbits $v_1 \leadsto
v_2$ between equilibrium vertices $v_1, v_2$ of adjacent Morse index. The
connection graphs can be described as a lattice-like structure of
Chafee-Infante subgraphs. However, this simple description requires us to
adjoin a single ``equilibrium'' vertex, formally, at Morse level -1.
Surprisingly, for parabolic PDEs based on irreversible diffusion, the
connection graphs then also exhibit global time reversibility.

antipodal points on unit $n$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ typically involve the
non-centrally synergistic hybrid controllers for attitude tracking on unit
quaternion space. However, when switching faults occur due to parameter errors,
the non-centrally synergistic property can lead to the unwinding problem or in
some cases, destabilize the desired set. In this work, a hybrid controller is
first proposed based on a novel centrally synergistic family of potential
functions on $\mathbb{S}^n$, which is generated from a basic potential function
through angular warping. The synergistic parameter can be explicitly expressed
if the warping angle has a positive lower bound at the undesired critical
points of the family. Next, the proposed approach induces a new
quaternion-based controller for global attitude tracking. It has three
advantageous features over existing synergistic designs: 1) it is consistent,
i.e., free from the ambiguity of unit quaternion representation; 2) it is
switching-fault-tolerant, i.e., the desired closed-loop equilibria remain
asymptotically stable even when the switching mechanism does not work; 3) it
relaxes the assumption on the parameter of the basic potential function in
literature. Comprehensive simulation confirms the high robustness of the
proposed centrally synergistic approach compared with existing non-centrally

modeled as a cooperative game and solved by the best-response dynamics, then
the reproduction and mutation are implemented by cloning and fluctuating
hyper-parameters of networks to learn more diversity, and population mutual

each other within the population. In addition, we propose a cross-reference

voxel methods are usually employed to down-sample dense events into sparse

sparse points/voxels as nodes and adopts graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn
the representation for event data. Although good performance can be obtained,
however, their results are still limited mainly due to two issues. (1) Existing
event GNNs generally adopt the additional max (or mean) pooling layer to
summarize all node embeddings into a single graph-level representation for the
whole event data representation. However, this approach fails to capture the
importance of graph nodes and also fails to be fully aware of the node
representations. (2) Existing methods generally employ either a sparse point or
voxel graph representation model which thus lacks consideration of the
complementary between these two types of representation models. To address
these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel dual point-voxel absorbing
graph representation learning for event stream data representation. To be
specific, given the input event stream, we first transform it into the sparse

to reveal their chemical and dynamical complexity. Spherical asymmetries, such
as spirals and disks, are prevalent and thought to be caused by binary
interaction with a (sub)stellar companion. Furthermore, high density outflows
show evidence of dust-gas interactions. The classical chemical model of these
outflows - a gas-phase only, spherically symmetric chemical kinetics model - is
hence not appropriate for a majority of observed outflows. We have included
several physical and chemical advancements step-by-step: a porous density
distribution, dust-gas chemistry, and internal UV photons originating from a
close-by stellar companion. Now, we combine these layers of complexity into the
most chemically and physically advanced chemical kinetics model of AGB outflows
to date. By varying over all model parameters, we obtain a holistic view of the
outflow's composition and how it (inter)depends on the different complexities.
A stellar companion has the largest influence, especially when combined with a
porous outflow. We compile sets of gas-phase molecules that trace the
importance of dust-gas chemistry and allow us to infer the presence of a
companion and porosity of the outflow. This shows that our new chemical model
can be used to infer physical and chemical properties of specific outflows, as
long as a suitable range of molecules is observed.

a subset of vertices $B\subset X$ and the distances $d_{(X,E)}(b_1,b_2)$ of all
vertices $b_1,b_2\in B$. The distance of points $x_1,x_2\in X$ is defined as
the minimal number of edges needed to connect two vertices, so all edges have
length 1. The inverse problem is a discrete version of the boundary rigidity
problem in Riemannian geometry or the inverse travel time problem in
geophysics. We will show that this problem has unique solution under certain
conditions and develop quantum computing methods to solve it. We prove the
following uniqueness result: when $(X,E)$ is a tree and $B$ is the set of
leaves of the tree, the graph $(X,E)$ can be uniquely determined in the class
of all graphs having a fixed number of vertices. We present a quantum computing
algorithm which produces a graph $(X,E)$, or one of those, which has a given
number of vertices and the required distances between vertices in $B$. To this
end we develop an algorithm that takes in a qubit representation of a graph and
combine it with Grover's search algorithm. The algorithm can be implemented
using only $O(|X|^2)$ qubits, the same order as the number of elements in the
adjacency matrix of $(X,E)$. It also has a quadratic improvement in
computational cost compared to standard classical algorithms. Finally, we
consider applications in theory of computation, and show that a slight
modification of the above inverse problem is NP-complete: all NP-problems can
be reduced to a discrete inverse problem we consider.

unsupervised domain adaptation and multi-source domain generalization methods
have been proposed, which, however, are less favorable for clinical practice
due to the cost of acquiring target-domain data and the privacy concerns
associated with redistributing the data from multiple source domains. In this
paper, we propose a \textbf{C}hannel-level \textbf{C}ontrastive \textbf{S}ingle
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{C$^2$SDG}) model for medical
image segmentation. In C$^2$SDG, the shallower features of each image and its
style-augmented counterpart are extracted and used for contrastive training,
resulting in the disentangled style representations and structure
representations. The segmentation is performed based solely on the structure
representations. Our method is novel in the contrastive perspective that
enables channel-wise feature disentanglement using a single source domain. We
evaluated C$^2$SDG against six SDG methods on a multi-domain joint optic cup

each module in C$^2$SDG and also indicate that C$^2$SDG outperforms the
baseline and all competing methods with a large margin. The code will be

clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators
that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to
predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With
12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on
on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed
martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA)
and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation
accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain
adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and
0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out
test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA
model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation

reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling
accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical
applications.

counterpart of bootstrap percolation models. From numerical investigations of
the model starting with randomly scattered discs in two dimensions, we find an
invasion transition that occurs via macroscopic avalanches. The disc
concentration threshold and the sharpness of the transition are found to
decrease as the system size is increased. Our results are consistent with a
vanishing threshold in the limit of infinitely large system sizes. However this
limit could not be investigated by simulations. For finite initial
concentrations of discs, the cluster size distribution presents a power-law
tail characterized by an exponent that varies approximately linearly with the
initial concentration of discs. These results at finite initial concentration
open novel directions for the understanding of the transition in systems of
finite size. Furthermore, we find that the domain area distribution has
oscillations with discontinuities. In addition, the deviation from circularity
of large domains is constant. Finally, we compare our results to experimental
observations on de-adhesion of graphene induced by the intercalation of
nanoparticles.

problem is through continual pre-training, i.e., fine-tuning pre-trained
language models (PLMs) on external resources (e.g., conversational corpora,
public intent detection datasets, or natural language understanding datasets)
before using them as utterance encoders for training an intent classifier. In
this paper, we show that continual pre-training may not be essential, since the
overfitting problem of PLMs on this task may not be as serious as expected.
Specifically, we find that directly fine-tuning PLMs on only a handful of
labeled examples already yields decent results compared to methods that employ
continual pre-training, and the performance gap diminishes rapidly as the
number of labeled data increases. To maximize the utilization of the limited
available data, we propose a context augmentation method and leverage
sequential self-distillation to boost performance. Comprehensive experiments on
real-world benchmarks show that given only two or more labeled samples per

studying scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. A positive geometry is
a specific semi-algebraic set equipped with a unique rational top form - the
canonical form. There are known examples where the canonical form of some
positive geometry, defined in some kinematic space, encodes a scattering
amplitude in some theory. Remarkably, the boundaries of the positive geometry
are in bijection with the physical singularities of the scattering amplitude.
The Amplituhedron, discovered by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka, is a prototypical
positive geometry. It lives in momentum twistor space and describes tree-level
(and the integrands of planar loop-level) scattering amplitudes in maximally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.
  In this dissertation, we study three positive geometries defined in on-shell
momentum space: the Arkani-Hamed-Bai-He-Yan (ABHY) associahedron, the Momentum
Amplituhedron, and the orthogonal Momentum Amplituhedron. Each describes
tree-level scattering amplitudes for different theories in different spacetime
dimensions. The three positive geometries share a series of interrelations in
terms of their boundary posets and canonical forms. We review these
relationships in detail, highlighting the author's contributions. We study
their boundary posets, classifying all boundaries and hence all physical
singularities at the tree level. We develop new combinatorial results to derive
rank-generating functions which enumerate boundaries according to their
dimension. These generating functions allow us to prove that the Euler
characteristics of the three positive geometries are one. In addition, we
discuss methods for manipulating canonical forms using ideas from computational
algebraic geometry.

hundreds of very UV-faint objects ($M_\mathrm{UV}>-18$). The faintest
($m\sim30$) galaxies in our sample typically have stellar masses of
$M_\ast\sim(1-3)\times10^7$ $M_\odot$ and young light-weighted ages ($\sim$50
Myr), though some show strong Balmer breaks implying much older ages ($\sim$500
Myr). We find no evidence for extremely massive galaxies ($>3\times10^{10}$
$M_\odot$) in our sample. We infer a strong (factor $>$2) decline in the
typical [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ EWs towards very faint $z\sim6-9$ galaxies, yet a
weak UV luminosity dependence on the H$\alpha$ EWs at $z\sim6$. We demonstrate
that these EW trends can be explained if fainter galaxies have systematically
lower metallicities as well as more recently-declining star formation histories
relative to the most UV-luminous galaxies in our sample. Our data provide
evidence that the brightest galaxies are frequently experiencing a recent
strong upturn in SFR. We also discuss how the EW trends may be influenced by a
strong correlation between $M_\mathrm{UV}$ and Lyman continuum escape fraction.
This alternative explanation has dramatically different implications for the
contribution of galaxies along the luminosity function to cosmic reionization,
highlighting the need for deep spectroscopic follow-up. Finally, we quantify
the photometric overdensities around two $z>7$ strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters in

meaningful and robust features, it is necessary to first comprehensively
understand the intrinsic pattern of the brain that is not restricted within a

interlinked neurons, the connectional properties in the brain have strong
biological significance, which is shared across multiple domains and covers
most pathological information. In this work, we propose a connectional style

it has a vision transformer (ViT) encoder and leverages mask reconstruction as
the proxy task and Gram matrices to guide the representation of connectional

achieves superior accuracy in multiple brain disease diagnosis tasks across six

as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or
have utilized supervised learning to train limited types of tools on compact
models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can
achieve generalized tool-use abilities without specific tool-specific training.
To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework
designed to automatically generate a tool-use corpus and learn generalized
tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention.
Specifically, ToolAlpaca first collects a comprehensive dataset by building a
multi-agent simulation environment, which contains 3938 tool-use instances from
more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories.
Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language
models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B,
respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize
previously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use
capabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like
GPT-3.5. This validation supports the notion that learning generalized tool-use
abilities is feasible for compact language models.

information on the Italian population, we model the circulation of people in
Italy before and during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19).
We perform a spatial and temporal clustering of the movement network at the
level of fluxes across provinces on a daily basis. The resulting partition in
time successfully identifies the first two lockdowns without any prior
information. Similarly, the spatial clustering returns 11 to 23 clusters
depending on the period (""standard"" mobility vs. lockdown) using the greedy
modularity communities clustering method, and 16 to 30 clusters using the
critical variable selection method. Fascinatingly, the spatial clusters
obtained with both methods are strongly reminiscent of the 11 regions into
which emperor Augustus had divided Italy according to Pliny the Elder. This
work introduces and validates a data analysis pipeline that enables us: i) to
assess the reliability of data obtained from a partial and potentially biased
sample of the population in performing estimates of population mobility
nationwide; ii) to identify areas of a Country with well-defined mobility
patterns, and iii) to distinguish different patterns from one another, resolve
them in time and find their optimal spatial extent. The proposed method is
generic and can be applied to other countries, with different geographical
scales, and also to similar networks (e.g. biological networks). The results
can thus represent a relevant step forward in the development of methods and
strategies for the containment of future epidemic phenomena.

effectiveness of its application in areas such as virtual reality (VR) and
augmented reality (AR) technologies. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) can generate
realistic images from any viewpoint. It simultaneously reconstructs the shape,
lighting, and materials of objects, and without surface defects, which breaks
down the barrier between virtuality and reality. The potential spatial
correspondences displayed by NeRF between reconstructed scenes and real-world
scenes offer a wide range of practical applications possibilities. Despite
significant progress in 3D reconstruction since NeRF were introduced, there
remains considerable room for exploration and experimentation. NeRF-based
models are susceptible to interference issues caused by colored ""fog"" noise.
Additionally, they frequently encounter instabilities and failures while
attempting to reconstruct unbounded scenes. Moreover, the model takes a
significant amount of time to converge, making it even more challenging to use
in such scenarios. Our approach, coined Enhance-NeRF, which adopts joint color
to balance low and high reflectivity objects display, utilizes a decoding
architecture with prior knowledge to improve recognition, and employs
multi-layer performance evaluation mechanisms to enhance learning capacity. It
achieves reconstruction of outdoor scenes within one hour under single-card
condition. Based on experimental results, Enhance-NeRF partially enhances
fitness capability and provides some support to outdoor scene reconstruction.
The Enhance-NeRF method can be used as a plug-and-play component, making it
easy to integrate with other NeRF-based models. The code is available at:

black-box solvers with superior sample efficiency, but it has been scarcely
been applied to such novel setups. To fill this gap, we propose a novel
Bayesian optimisation framework that optimises over functions defined on
generic, large-scale and potentially unknown graphs. Through the learning of
suitable kernels on graphs, our framework has the advantage of adapting to the
behaviour of the target function. The local modelling approach further
guarantees the efficiency of our method. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
optimisation framework.

Processing (NLP) applications such as automatic job recommendations. We address
an important limitation of theoretical discussions dealing with group-wise
fairness metrics: they focus on large datasets, although the norm in many
industrial NLP applications is to use small to reasonably large linguistic
datasets for which the main practical constraint is to get a good prediction
accuracy. We then question how reliable are different popular measures of bias
when the size of the training set is simply sufficient to learn reasonably
accurate predictions. Our experiments sample the Bios dataset and learn more
than 200 models on different sample sizes. This allows us to statistically
study our results and to confirm that common gender bias indices provide
diverging and sometimes unreliable results when applied to relatively small
training and test samples. This highlights the crucial importance of variance
calculations for providing sound results in this field.

autonomously and safely navigate between multiple target locations in
potentially challenging environments. Currently, this type of multi-goal
mission often relies on humans designing a set of actions for the robot to
follow in the form of a path or waypoints. In this work, we consider the
multi-goal problem of visiting a set of pre-defined targets, each of which
could be visited from multiple potential locations. To increase autonomy in
these missions, we propose a safe multi-goal (SMUG) planner that generates an
optimal motion path to visit those targets. To increase safety and efficiency,
we propose a hierarchical state validity checking scheme, which leverages
robot-specific traversability learned in simulation. We use LazyPRM* with an
informed sampler to accelerate collision-free path generation. Our iterative
dynamic programming algorithm enables the planner to generate a path visiting
more than ten targets within seconds. Moreover, the proposed hierarchical state
validity checking scheme reduces the planning time by 30% compared to pure
volumetric collision checking and increases safety by avoiding high-risk
regions. We deploy the SMUG planner on the quadruped robot ANYmal and show its
capability to guide the robot in multi-goal missions fully autonomously on
rough terrain.

complex reasoning and contextual background knowledge. Ideally, we could
leverage an explicit external knowledge base to supplement contextual and
cultural information in hateful memes. However, there is no known explicit
external knowledge base that could provide such hate speech contextual
information. To address this gap, we propose PromptHate, a simple yet effective
prompt-based model that prompts pre-trained language models (PLMs) for hateful
meme classification. Specifically, we construct simple prompts and provide a
few in-context examples to exploit the implicit knowledge in the pre-trained
RoBERTa language model for hateful meme classification. We conduct extensive
experiments on two publicly available hateful and offensive meme datasets. Our
experimental results show that PromptHate is able to achieve a high AUC of
90.96, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on the hateful meme
classification task. We also perform fine-grained analyses and case studies on
various prompt settings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the prompts on
hateful meme classification.

is not fully explored. Here, we present an effective geometric scheme combined
with a general dynamical-corrected technique, with which the super-robust

systematic error, i.e., $\sigma_x$ error. In addition, combined with the
decoherence-free subspace (DFS) coding, the resulting geometric gates can also
effectively suppress the $\sigma_z$ error caused by the collective dephasing.
Notably, our protocol is a general one with simple experimental setups, which
can be potentially implemented in different quantum systems, such as Rydberg
atoms, trapped ions and superconducting qubits. These results indicate that our
scheme represents a promising way to explore large-scale fault-tolerant quantum

ICSs in critical infrastructure, it is important to test their resilience
against manipulations of sensor/actuator inputs. Unfortunately, existing

the simplest-to-craft manipulations for a testing goal, and are also unable to
determine when a test is simply a minor permutation of another, i.e. based on
the same causal events. In this work, we propose a guided fuzzing approach for

events in a test, generalises them to an equivalence class, and then updates
the fuzzing strategy so as to find new tests that are causally different from
those already identified. An evaluation of our approach on a real-world water

precision. Approaches using dense frame-based representations processed via
well-pretrained CNNs are being replaced by the use of sparse point-based
representations learned through graph CNNs (GCN). Yet, the efficacy of these
graph methods is far behind their frame-based counterparts with two
limitations. ($i$) Biased graph construction without carefully integrating
variant attributes ($i.e.$, semantics, spatial and temporal cues) for each
vertex, leading to imprecise graph representation. ($ii$) Deficient learning
because of the lack of well-pretrained models available. Here we solve the
first problem by proposing a new event-based GCN (EDGCN), with a dynamic
aggregation module to integrate all attributes of vertices adaptively. To
address the second problem, we introduce a novel learning framework called
cross-representation distillation (CRD), which leverages the dense
representation of events as a cross-representation auxiliary to provide
additional supervision and prior knowledge for the event graph. This
frame-to-graph distillation allows us to benefit from the large-scale priors
provided by CNNs while still retaining the advantages of graph-based models.
Extensive experiments show our model and learning framework are effective and
generalize well across multiple vision tasks.

network (GRN) which describes interactions between genes and their products
that control gene expression and cellular function. We can treat this as a
causal discovery problem but with two non-standard challenges: (1) regulatory
networks are inherently cyclic so we should not model a GRN as a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), and (2) observations have significant measurement noise,
so for typical sample sizes there will always be a large equivalence class of
graphs that are likely given the data, and we want methods that capture this
uncertainty. Existing methods either focus on challenge (1), identifying cyclic
structure from dynamics, or on challenge (2) learning complex Bayesian
posteriors over DAGs, but not both. In this paper we leverage the fact that it
is possible to estimate the ""velocity"" of gene expression with RNA velocity
techniques to develop an approach that addresses both challenges. Because we
have access to velocity information, we can treat the Bayesian structure
learning problem as a problem of sparse identification of a dynamical system,
capturing cyclic feedback loops through time. Since our objective is to model
uncertainty over discrete structures, we leverage Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets) to estimate the posterior distribution over the combinatorial space
of possible sparse dependencies. Our results indicate that our method learns
posteriors that better encapsulate the distributions of cyclic structures

explicitly tracking the set of particles identified as belonging to a halo's

algorithms have emerged as promising candidates for solving these problems in
the noisy intermediate-scale quantum stage. However, the constraints are often
complex enough to make their efficient mapping to quantum hardware difficult or
even infeasible. An alternative standard approach is to transform the
optimization problem to include these constraints as penalty terms, but this
method involves additional hyperparameters and does not ensure that the
constraints are satisfied due to the existence of local minima. In this paper,
we introduce a new method for solving combinatorial optimization problems with
challenging constraints using variational quantum algorithms. We propose the
Multi-Objective Variational Constrained Optimizer (MOVCO) to classically update
the variational parameters by a multiobjective optimization performed by a
genetic algorithm. This optimization allows the algorithm to progressively
sample only states within the in-constraints space, while optimizing the energy

relevance in finance: the Cash Management problem. We introduce a novel
mathematical formulation for this problem, and compare the performance of MOVCO
versus a penalty based optimization. Our empirical results show a significant
improvement in terms of the cost of the achieved solutions, but especially in

(CPG) transmits signals along one or more feedforward chains in a synchronous

especially in locomotion and peristalsis, and are of interest for continuum
robots. We construct such networks as feedforward lifts of the CPG. If the CPG
dynamics is periodic, so is the lifted dynamics. Synchrony with the CPG
manifests as a standing wave, and a regular phase pattern creates a travelling
wave. We discuss Liapunov, asymptotic, and Floquet stability of the lifted
periodic orbit and introduce transverse versions of these conditions that imply
stability for signals propagating along arbitrarily long chains. We compare
these notions to a simpler condition, transverse stability of the synchrony
subspace, which is equivalent to Floquet stability when nodes are

the bone marrow. In Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) conditions, the cells
partially become mature that look like normal white blood cells but do not
resist infection effectively. Early detection of CML is important for effective
treatment, but there is a lack of routine screening tests. Regular check-ups
and monitoring of symptoms are the best way to detect CML in the early stages.
In the study, we developed a multi-layer-perception-based meta-ensemble system
using protein amino acid sequences for early risk prediction of CML. The
deleterious mutation analysis of protein sequences provides 7discriminant
information in amino acid sequences causing CML. The protein sequences are
expressed into molecular descriptors using the values of hydrophobicity and
hydrophilicity of the amino acids. 9 These descriptors are transformed in
various statistical and correlation-based feature spaces. These 10 features
information is given to several diverse types of base learners. The preliminary
predictions of 11 base-learners are employed to develop Multi-Layered
Perceptron (MLP) based meta-ensemble. The 12 proposed learning approach
effectively utilizes the discriminant information to classify CML/non- 13 CML
protein sequences. The proposed prediction system has given improved results
and it can be 14 employed as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of CML.

continuous leading coefficient in nonsmooth domains by finite element methods.
These solutions satisfy the Alexandrov-Bakelman-Pucci (ABP) maximum principle,
which provides an a~posteriori error control for $C^1$ conforming
approximations. By minimizing this residual, we obtain an approximation to the
solution $u$ in the $L^\infty$ norm. Although discontinuous functions do not
satisfy the ABP maximum principle, this approach extends to nonconforming FEM
as well thanks to well-established enrichment operators. Convergence of the
proposed FEM is established for uniform mesh-refinements. The built-in

superiorly in the numerical benchmarks in comparison to the uniform

excitation fields. We have developed a post-processing method and package that
can efficiently calculate the full three-dimensional electric and magnetic
fields for any optical beam incident on a particle or structure with at least
one axis of continuous rotational symmetry, called an axisymmetric body (such
as a sphere, cylinder, cone, torus or surface). Provided an initial batch of
plane wave simulations is computed, this open-source package combines data from
computational electromagnetic solvers in a post-processing fashion using the
angular spectrum representation to create arbitrarily structured beams,
including vector vortex beams. Any and all possible incident beams can be
generated from the initial batch of plane wave simulations, without the need
for further simulations. This allows for efficiently performing parameter
sweeps such as changing the angle of illumination or translating the particle
position relative to the beam, all in post-processing, with no need for
additional time-consuming simulations. We demonstrate some applications by
numerically calculating optical force and torque maps for a spherical plasmonic
nanoparticle in a tightly focused Gaussian beam, a plasmonic nanocone in an
azimuthally polarised beam and compute the fields of a non-paraxial
Laguerre-Gaussian vortex beam reflecting on a multilayered surface. We believe

to the realization that a 3/2$^+$ resonance in the DT system enhances the
fusion cross section by a factor of one hundred at energies relevant to
applications. This was a transformational discovery, making the quest for
terrestrial fusion energy possible. The earliest measurements were reasonably
accurate given the technology of the time and the scarcity of tritium, and were

  Privacy on MIMIC-III",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Federated learning methods offer the possibility of training
machine learning models on privacy-sensitive data sets, which cannot be easily
shared. Multiple regulations pose strict requirements on the storage and usage
of healthcare data, leading to data being in silos (i.e. locked-in at
healthcare facilities). The application of federated algorithms on these
datasets could accelerate disease diagnostic, drug development, as well as
improve patient care.
  Methods: We present an extensive evaluation of the impact of different
federation and differential privacy techniques when training models on the
open-source MIMIC-III dataset. We analyze a set of parameters influencing a
federated model performance, namely data distribution (homogeneous and
heterogeneous), communication strategies (communication rounds vs. local
training epochs), federation strategies (FedAvg vs. FedProx). Furthermore, we
assess and compare two differential privacy (DP) techniques during model
training: a stochastic gradient descent-based differential privacy algorithm
(DP-SGD), and a sparse vector differential privacy technique (DP-SVT).
  Results: Our experiments show that extreme data distributions across sites
(imbalance either in the number of patients or the positive label ratios
between sites) lead to a deterioration of model performance when trained using
the FedAvg strategy. This issue is resolved when using FedProx with the use of
appropriate hyperparameter tuning. Furthermore, the results show that both
differential privacy techniques can reach model performances similar to those
of models trained without DP, however at the expense of a large quantifiable
privacy leakage.
  Conclusions: We evaluate empirically the benefits of two federation
strategies and propose optimal strategies for the choice of parameters when
using differential privacy techniques.

been driven by what AI can or cannot do in terms of human capacities. In this
paper, we tackle the problem from the other end by exploring what kind of moral
machines are possible based on what computational systems can or cannot do. To
do so, we analyze normative ethics through the lens of computational
complexity. First, we introduce computational complexity for the uninitiated
reader and discuss how the complexity of ethical problems can be framed within
Marr's three levels of analysis. We then study a range of ethical problems
based on consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics, with the aim of
elucidating the complexity associated with the problems themselves (e.g., due
to combinatorics, uncertainty, strategic dynamics), the computational methods
employed (e.g., probability, logic, learning), and the available resources
(e.g., time, knowledge, learning). The results indicate that most problems the
normative frameworks pose lead to tractability issues in every category
analyzed. Our investigation also provides several insights about the
computational nature of normative ethics, including the differences between
rule- and outcome-based moral strategies, and the implementation-variance with
regard to moral resources. We then discuss the consequences complexity results
have for the prospect of moral machines in virtue of the trade-off between
optimality and efficiency. Finally, we elucidate how computational complexity
can be used to inform both philosophical and cognitive-psychological research

winding vector fields of local magnetization, has attracted considerable
attention due to both fundamental interest in the dynamics of topological
solitons, and potential spintronic applications. While widely-used Thiele
equation with zero skyrmion mass captures its rigid motion under the assumption
of preserved skyrmion shape, experiments on realistic skyrmions find deviation
due to inertial mass with numerous attempts to account for it by invoking
internal skyrmion dynamics, geometry of the nanowire, and interaction with
magnons or phonons. However, experimentally observed skyrmion mass is often
much larger than predicted by these theories. In this Letter, we employ
Schwinger-Keldysh field-theoretical approach to study conduction electrons
interacting with localized magnetic moments comprising a skyrmion to obtain a
stochastic differential equation of its motion. By analyzing its time-retarded
damping kernel, we extract an anisotropic mass governed by conduction electrons
and demonstrate its substantial effect on the current-driven skyrmion motion,
even in the absence of any skyrmion deformation.

$k$ on their edit distance, the algorithm of Myers (Algorithmica'86) and Landau
and Vishkin (JCSS'88) computes the unweighted string edit distance in
$\mathcal{O}(n+k^2)$ time. Till date, it remains the fastest algorithm for
exact edit distance computation, and it is optimal under the Strong Exponential
Hypothesis (STOC'15). Over the years, this result has inspired many
developments, including fast approximation algorithms for string edit distance
as well as similar $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n+$poly$(k))$-time algorithms for
generalizations to tree and Dyck edit distances. Surprisingly, all these
results hold only for unweighted instances.
  While unweighted edit distance is theoretically fundamental, almost all
real-world applications require weighted edit distance, where different weights
are assigned to different edit operations and may vary with the characters
being edited. Given a weight function $w: \Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon \}\times
\Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon \} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ (such that
$w(a,a)=0$ and $w(a,b)\ge 1$ for all $a,b\in \Sigma \cup \{\varepsilon\}$ with

edits. Except for the vanilla $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-time dynamic-programming

weighted variant. In this paper, we propose the first
$\mathcal{O}(n+$poly$(k))$-time algorithm that computes weighted string edit
distance exactly, thus bridging a fundamental gap between our understanding of
unweighted and weighted edit distance. We then generalize this result to
weighted tree and Dyck edit distances, which lead to a deterministic algorithm
that improves upon the previous work for unweighted tree edit distance.

proposing the first self-supervised approach for generating a BEV semantic map
using a single monocular image from the frontal view (FV). During training, we
overcome the need for BEV ground truth annotations by leveraging the more
easily available FV semantic annotations of video sequences. Thus, we propose
the SkyEye architecture that learns based on two modes of self-supervision,
namely, implicit supervision and explicit supervision. Implicit supervision
trains the model by enforcing spatial consistency of the scene over time based
on FV semantic sequences, while explicit supervision exploits BEV pseudolabels
generated from FV semantic annotations and self-supervised depth estimates.
Extensive evaluations on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that our
self-supervised approach performs on par with the state-of-the-art fully
supervised methods and achieves competitive results using only 1% of direct
supervision in the BEV compared to fully supervised approaches. Finally, we
publicly release both our code and the BEV datasets generated from the

in the Heisenberg-Langevin approach. Specifically, we analyze the dynamics of
two nonlinearly coupled oscillator modes in a PT-symmetric system. An
analytical solution allows us to separate the contribution of reservoir
fluctuations from the evolution of quantum statistical properties of the modes.
In general, as reservoir fluctuations act constantly, the complete loss of
nonclassicality and entanglement is observed for long times. To elucidate the
role of reservoir fluctuations in a long-time evolution of nonclassicality and
entanglement, we consider and compare the predictions from two alternative
models in which no fatal long-time detrimental effects on the nonclassicality
and entanglement are observed. This is so as, in the first semiclassical model,
no reservoir fluctuations are considered at all. This, however, violates the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The second, more elaborated, model obeys the
fluctuation-dissipation relations as it partly involves reservoir fluctuations.
However, to prevent from the above long-time detrimental effects, the reservoir
fluctuations have to be endowed with the nonphysical properties of a sink
model. In both models, additional incorporation of the omitted reservoir
fluctuations results in their physically consistent behavior. This behavior,
however, predicts the gradual loss of the nonclassicality and entanglement.
Thus the effects of reservoir fluctuations related to damping cannot be
compensated by those related to amplification.

to check those that reproduce the experimental results. The chemical models
with ProDiMo can reproduce the methanol ice destruction via UV
photodissociation at temperatures of 20, 30, 50 and 70 K as observed in the

  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.ao-ph physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Present-day Mars is cold and dry, but mineralogical and morphological
evidence shows that liquid-water existed on the surface of ancient Mars. In
order to explain this evidence and assess ancient Mars's habitability, one must
understand the size and composition of the ancient atmosphere. Here we place
constraints on the ancient Martian atmosphere by modeling the coupled,
self-consistent evolution of atmospheric CO2, N2, and Ar on Mars from 3.8
billion years ago (Ga) to the present. Our model traces the evolution of these
species' abundances and isotopic composition caused by atmospheric escape,
volcanic outgassing, and crustal interaction. Using a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo
method to explore a plausible range of parameters, we find hundreds of
thousands of model solutions that recreate the modern Martian atmosphere. These
solutions indicate that Mars's atmosphere contained 0.3-1.5 bar CO2 and 0.1-0.5
bar N2 at 3.8 Ga. The global volume of deposited carbonates critically
determines the ancient atmospheric composition. For example, a ~1 bar CO2
ancient atmosphere with 0.2-0.4 bar N2 requires ~0.9 bar CO2 deposited in
carbonates primarily in open-water systems. With the joint analysis of C, N,
and Ar isotopes, we refine the constraints on the relative strengths of
outgassing and sputtering, leading to an indication of a reduced early mantle
from which the outgassing is sourced. Our results indicate that a CO2-N2
atmosphere with a potential H2 component on ancient Mars is consistent with
Mars's geochemical evolution and may explain the evidence for its past warm and
wet climate.

mid-to-late M dwarfs compared to earlier-type stars, while the occurrence rate
of terrestrial planets is comparable to that of more massive M dwarfs. We
estimate that overall, terrestrials outnumber sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M

equinumerous. We place a $1\sigma$ upper limit of 0.07 planets larger than 1.5

should collect, synchronously, Electromyography (EMG) and kinematic data. This
method introduces a simplified markerless gait event detection pipeline for the
segmentation of EMG signals, via synchronously recorded Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) data. In an unconstrained walking experiment, healthy subjects walk
through a designed course with their kinematic and EMG data recorded. This
course comprises 5 different walking modalities (level walking, ramp up/down,
staircase up/down), mimicking everyday walking. Through timepoint matching,
segmentation and filtering, we generate an algorithm that detects heel-strike
(HS) events using a single IMU, and isolates EMG activity of gait cycles, in
the different walking modalities. This gait event detection algorithm can be
adapted to different datasets, and was tested in both healthy and Parkinson's
Disease (PD) gait. Results demonstrate the extracted muscle activity levels in
a healthy subject's level ground walking, and the extracted HS events of a PD
patient. Adjustments to algorithm parameters are possible (e.g., expected

based on the mass of their dark-matter halos and the fraction of
baryon-to-total matter in the universe, giving rise to the so called galaxy
missing-baryon problem. The presence of cool circum-galactic matter
gravitationally bound to its galaxy's halo up to distances of at least ten
times the size of the galaxy's disk, mitigates the problem but is far from
being sufficient for its solution. It has instead been suggested, that the
galaxy missing baryons may hide in a much hotter gaseous phase of the
circum-galactic medium, possibly near the halo virial temperature and
co-existing with the cool phase. Here we exploit the best available X-ray
spectra of known cool circum-galactic absorbers of L$^*$ galaxies to report the
first direct high-statistical-significance ($5.3-6.2\sigma$) detection of
associated OVII and NVI absorption in the stacked XMM-Newton and Chandra

X-ray halo of these systems, at logT(in k)$\simeq 5.73-6.4$ K (comprising the
halo virial temperature T$_{vir} = 10^6$ K). We estimate a mass of the X-ray
halo within 1 virial radius M$_{hot-CGM}\simeq (0.6-3)\times 10^{11} (Z/0.3

of spin information, offers the potential for molecular color centers to be a
paradigm shifting materials class beyond diamond-NV centers by accessing a
distance scale opaque to NVs. This capability could, for example, address
ambiguity in the reported magnetic fields arising from two-dimensional magnets
by allowing for a single sensing technique to be used over a wider range of
distances. Yet, so far, these abilities have only been hypothesized with
theoretical validation absent. We show through simulation that
Cr($o$-tolyl)$_{4}$ can spatially resolve proximity-exchange versus direct
magnetic field effects from monolayer CrI$_{3}$ by quantifying how these
interactions impact the excited states of the molecule. At short distances,
proximity exchange dominates through molecule-substrate interactions, but at
further distances the molecule behaves as a typical magnetic sensor, with
magnetostatic effects dominating changes to the energy of the excited state.
Our models effectively demonstrate how a molecular color center could be used
to measure the magnetic field of a 2D magnet and the role different
distance-dependent interactions contribute to the measured field.

approximation (WFA) to high-spatial-resolution Ca II 854.2 nm data taken with
the Swedish 1m Solar Telescope. Specifically, we analyzed the estimates
inferred for different spectral ranges using the data at the original cadence
and temporally integrated signals. The longitudinal magnetic field in each
considered plasma structure correlates with its size. Using a spectral range
restricted to the line core leads to chromospheric longitudinal fields varying
from 50 G at the edges to 150-500 G at the center of the structure. These
values increase as the spectral range widens due to the photospheric
contribution. However, the difference between this contribution and the
chromospheric one is not uniform for all structures. Small and medium-sized
concentrations show a steeper height gradient in B_lon compared to their
chromospheric values, so estimates for wider ranges are less trustworthy.
Signal addition does not alleviate this situation as the height gradients in
B_lon are consistent with time. Finally, despite the amplified noise levels
that deconvolving processes may cause, data restored with the destretching
technique show similar results, though are affected by smearing. We obtained
B_lon estimates similar to those previously found, except for large
concentrations and wide spectral ranges. In addition, we report a correlation

MARTINI force fields successfully capture the structural properties of the MOF

overall well reproduced, with MARTINI 2.0 models however having the tendency to
slightly overestimate it. The trend of having higher values of C11 elastic

a simple scalar norm of the $D$ additional variables. The new models reduce to
PFGM when $D{=}1$ and to diffusion models when $D{\to}\infty$. The flexibility
of choosing $D$ allows us to trade off robustness against rigidity as
increasing $D$ results in more concentrated coupling between the data and the
additional variable norms. We dispense with the biased large batch field
targets used in PFGM and instead provide an unbiased perturbation-based
objective similar to diffusion models. To explore different choices of $D$, we
provide a direct alignment method for transferring well-tuned hyperparameters

response properties is in principle straightforward due to the natural ability
of quantum computers to simulate unitary time evolution, circuit depth
limitations restrict the maximum time that can be simulated and hence the
extraction of frequency-domain properties. Computing properties directly in the
frequency domain is therefore desirable, but the circuits require large depth
when the typical hardware gate set consisting of single- and two-qubit gates is
used. Here, we report the experimental quantum computation of the response
properties of diatomic molecules directly in the frequency domain using a
three-qubit iToffoli gate, enabling a reduction in circuit depth by a factor of
two. We show that the molecular properties obtained with the iToffoli gate
exhibit comparable or better agreement with theory than those obtained with the

played by the cosmological constant, and the impact of the collapse dynamics in
determining black-hole configurations realized in Nature. In particular, we
will review how quantum gravity could modify the Buchdahl limit and the

observations centering at 0.58 $\mu$m, and the NICMOS instrument at 1.12 $\mu$m

reference differential imaging for STIS, and adopted non-negative matrix
factorization with forward modeling for NICMOS. By dividing disk signals by
stellar signals to take into account of intrinsic stellar color effects, we
systematically obtained and compared the reflectance of debris birth rings at
~90 deg scattering angle. Debris birth rings typically exhibit a blue color at
~90 deg scattering angle. As the stellar luminosity increases, the color tends
to be more neutral. A likely L-shaped color-albedo distribution indicates a
clustering of scatterer properties. The observed color trend correlates with
the expected blow-out size of dust particles. The color-albedo clustering
likely suggests different populations of dust in these systems. More detailed
radiative transfer models with realistic dust morphology will contribute to
explaining the observed color and color-albedo distribution of debris systems.

superconductor. We define the critical current as the value of the supercurrent
at which the quasiparticle excitation gap closes (depairing). Once the critical
current is exceeded, the quasiparticles can exchange energy with the
superconducting condensate, giving rise to dissipation. Our minimal model can
be microscopically derived as a low-energy limit of a Rashba spin-orbit coupled
superconductor in a Zeeman field. Within the proposed model, we explore the
nature of the non-reciprocal effects of the critical current both analytically
and numerically. Our results quantify how system parameters such as spin-orbit
coupling and quantum confinement affect the strength of the superconducting
diode effect. Our theory provides a complementary description to
Ginzburg-Landau theories of the effect.

HeII-only AGN population is hosted by massive (M$_*\gtrsim10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$)

AGN. Given the HeII line faintness, we revisit our census accounting for

obtain an overall increased fraction (11%) of AGN in MaNGA compared to the
BPT-only census (9%), which further increases to 14% for galaxies more massive

that the non-perturbative effects of these loop cosmologies are universally
encoded by a logarithmic correction that only depends on the bounce curvature

accretion time t0 and radius R that have strong influence on temperature and

boulder microporosity, hydration, and partial dehydration of the material, we
constrain a field within the (R,t0)-space appropriate for bodies that are

system. Here we introduce a spaceplate based on conventional optics in a 4-$f$
arrangement, mimicking the transfer function of free-space in a thinner system
- we term this device a three-lens spaceplate. It is broadband,
polarization-independent, and can be used for meter-scale space compression. We
experimentally measure compression ratios up to 15.6, replacing up to 4.4
meters of free-space, three orders of magnitude greater than current optical
spaceplates. We demonstrate that three-lens spaceplates reduce the length of a
full-color imaging system, albeit with reductions in resolution and contrast.
We present theoretical limits on the numerical aperture and the compression
ratio. Our design presents a simple, accessible, cost-effective method for
optically compressing large amounts of space.

using simulations and experiments. The flow is three-dimensional and
characterized by a large, dominant vortex structure that fills most of the
cavity at moderate Reynolds numbers with a weak, yet significant flow in the
axial direction along the vortex core. Classical bubble-type vortex breakdown
is observed within the cavity above a certain critical Reynolds number, which
is a function of the channel width. The critical Reynolds number for the onset
of breakdown is determined as a function of channel width, and the evolution
and dynamical transitions of the breakdown regions are investigated as
functions of the channel width and Reynolds number. At large cavity widths, two
vortex breakdown bubbles emerge near the sidewalls symmetric about the
centerplane, which grow and eventually merge as the Reynolds number increases.
For large-enough widths, the vortex breakdown regions remain well-separated and
their structures become independent of the cavity width. The stability and
bifurcations of the stagnation points and their transitions to stable/unstable
limit cycles are analyzed, and the criticality of the vortex flow is
calculated, demonstrating that the vortex breakdown in the cavity agrees with
Benjamin's interpretation of criticality. At the intermediate width regime, a
single vortex breakdown bubble appears above the critical Reynolds number. In
the narrow width regime, the flow exhibits more complicated modes. An
additional vortex breakdown mode with reversed flow patterns is observed in
this width regime, along with multiple shifts in the stability of stagnation
points. The experimental and numerical results also demonstrate the sensitivity
of the flow to the inlet conditions, such that relatively small asymmetries
upstream can result in significant changes to the vortex breakdown behavior in
the cavity.

bolometers. The study includes SPICE modeling of the entire setup including the
cryogenic harness, LC filters, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device
(SQUID) and room-temperature amplifier. Simulation results show that the long
harness (for flight model) could cause multiple reflections that generate
repetitive spikes in the spectrum. Peaks of the OBR are mainly due to the
parasitic capacitances at the input of SQUID. Implementing a low-pass RC
circuit (snubber) at the input of the SQUID dampened the OBR. As a result, the
first peak only appears around 20 MHz which is a safe margin for the 1 MHz-3.8
MHz FDM in use in the prototype readout. Using a spectrum analyzer and
broadband LNAs,we also measured the OBR for the prototype FDM readout in the
lab up to 500 MHz. The measurement was conducted at temperatures of 50 mK and 4
K and for various biasing of the DC SQUID. It turns out that OBR are more
intense at 50 mK and are caused by the harness impedance mismatch rather than
the SQUID. Simulation codes and supporting materials are available at

lower-redshift galaxies. This is best illustrated by the [OIII]/[OII] ratio,
tracing interstellar medium (ISM) ionisation, in which we observe more than
half of our sample to have [OIII]/[OII]>10. Our high signal-to-noise spectra
reveal more than an order of magnitude of scatter in line ratios such as
[OII]/H$\beta$ and [OIII]/[OII], indicating significant diversity in the ISM
conditions within the sample. We find no convincing detections of [NII] in our

The emission line ratios observed in our sample are generally consistent with
galaxies with extremely high ionisation parameters (log $U\sim-1.5$), and a
range of metallicities spanning from $\sim0.1\times Z_\odot$ to higher than
$\sim0.3\times Z_\odot$, suggesting we are probing low-metallicity systems

Recently, the combination of random subsampling with lexicase selection

this paper, we propose down-sampled epsilon-lexicase selection which combines

reduced by using down-sampled epsilon-lexicase selection compared to standard

observe for down-sampled epsilon-lexicase selection. Further, we find that
down-sampled epsilon-lexicase selection outperforms the traditional selection
methods on all studied problems. Overall, with down-sampled epsilon-lexicase
selection we observe an improvement of the solution quality of up to 85% in

that are widely used in diagnosing and treating diverse diseases, 3D
segmentation is one of the fundamental tasks of medical image analysis.
Recently, Transformer-based models have started to achieve state-of-the-art
performances across many vision tasks, through pre-training on large-scale
natural image benchmark datasets. While works on medical image analysis have
also begun to explore Transformer-based models, there is currently no optimal
strategy to effectively leverage pre-trained Transformers, primarily due to the
difference in dimensionality between 2D natural images and 3D medical images.
Existing solutions either split 3D images into 2D slices and predict each slice
independently, thereby losing crucial depth-wise information, or modify the
Transformer architecture to support 3D inputs without leveraging pre-trained
weights. In this work, we use a simple yet effective weight inflation strategy
to adapt pre-trained Transformers from 2D to 3D, retaining the benefit of both
transfer learning and depth information. We further investigate the
effectiveness of transfer from different pre-training sources and objectives.
Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances across a broad range of 3D
medical image datasets, and can become a standard strategy easily utilized by
all work on Transformer-based models for 3D medical images, to maximize
performance.

key difficulty of diffusion model quantization as the changing output
distributions of noise estimation networks over multiple time steps and the
bimodal activation distribution of the shortcut layers within the noise
estimation network. We tackle these challenges with timestep-aware calibration
and split shortcut quantization in this work. Experimental results show that
our proposed method is able to quantize full-precision unconditional diffusion
models into 4-bit while maintaining comparable performance (small FID change of

We used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array to target an ensemble of tracers of
ionized, neutral, and molecular gas, namely the fine-structure lines: [OIII]
88$\mu$m, [NII] 122$\mu$m, [CII] 158$\mu$m, and [CI] 370$\mu$m and the

lines are detected, as are half of the targeted molecular transitions. By
combining the associated line luminosities, the constraints on the dust
temperature from the underlying continuum emission, and predictions from
photoionization models of the interstellar medium, we find that the ionized
phase accounts for about one third of the total gaseous mass budget, and is
responsible for half of the total [CII] emission. It is characterized by high
density (n~180 cm$^{-3}$), typical of HII regions. The spectral energy
distribution of the photoionizing radiation is comparable to that emitted by
B-type stars. Star formation also appears to drive the excitation of the
molecular medium. We find marginal evidence for outflow-related shocks in the
dense molecular phase, but not in other gas phases. This study showcases the
power of multi-line investigations in unveiling the properties of the

costs of communication among their components are large. These systems also
tend to split information transmitted between any two components across
multiple channels. A common hypothesis is that such inverse multiplexing
strategies reduce total thermodynamic costs. So far, however, there have been
no physics-based results supporting this hypothesis. This gap existed partially
because we have lacked a theoretical framework that addresses the interplay of
thermodynamics and information in off-equilibrium systems at any spatiotemporal
scale. Here we present the first study that rigorously combines such a
framework, stochastic thermodynamics, with Shannon information theory. We
develop a minimal model that captures the fundamental features common to a wide
variety of communication systems. We find that the thermodynamic cost in this
model is a convex function of the channel capacity, the canonical measure of
the communication capability of a channel. We also find that this function is
not always monotonic, in contrast to previous results not derived from first
principles physics. These results clarify when and how to split a single
communication stream across multiple channels. In particular, we present Pareto
fronts that reveal the trade-off between thermodynamic costs and channel
capacity when inverse multiplexing. Due to the generality of our model, our
findings could help explain empirical observations of how thermodynamic costs
of information transmission make inverse multiplexing energetically favorable
in many real-world communication systems.

corresponding to free games with entangled players, and, somewhat less
obviously, (2) BellQMA(2), the class of quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems
with two unentangled Merlins, whose proof states are separately measured by
Arthur. In this work, we make significant progress towards a tight
characterization of both of these classes. 1. We show a BellQMA(2) protocol for
3SAT on $n$ variables, where the total amount of communication is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$. This answers an open question of Chen and Drucker (2010)
and also shows, conditional on ETH, that the algorithm of Brand\~{a}o,
Christandl and Yard (STOC'11) is tight up to logarithmic factors. 2. We show
that $\mathsf{AM}^*[n_{\text{provers}} = 2, q = O(1), a =\mathrm{poly}\log(n)]

are as powerful as general entangled games. Our result is a significant
improvement over the headline result of Ji et al. (2020), whose MIP* protocol
for the halting problem has $\mathrm{poly}(n)$-sized questions and answers. 3.
We obtain a zero-gap AM* protocol for a $\Pi_2$ complete language with
constant-size questions and almost logarithmically large answers, improving on
the headline result of Mousavi, Nezhadi and Yuen (STOC'22). 4. Using a
connection to the nonuniform complexity of the halting problem we show that any

follows that our results in item 3 are optimal up to an $O(\log^* n)$ factor,
and that the gapless compression theorems of MNY'22 are asymptotically optimal.

critical chains using an explicit protocol, whereby correlated ancilla are
entangled with the critical chain and then projectively measured. Using a
perturbative analytic framework supported by extensive numerical simulations,
we demonstrate that measurements can qualitatively alter long-distance
correlations in a manner dependent on the choice of entangling gate, ancilla
measurement basis, measurement outcome, and nature of ancilla correlations.
Measurements can, for example, modify the Ising order-parameter scaling
dimension and catalyze order parameter condensation. We derive numerous
quantitative predictions for the behavior of correlations in select measurement
outcomes, and also identify two strategies for detecting measurement-altered
Ising criticality in measurement-averaged quantities. First, averaging the
square of the order-parameter expectation value over measurement outcomes
retains memory of order parameter condensation germinated in fixed measurement
outcomes -- even though on average the order parameter itself vanishes. Second,
we show that, in certain cases, observables can be averaged separately over
measurement outcomes residing in distinct symmetry sectors; we demonstrate that
these `symmetry-resolved averages' reveal measurement effects even when
considering standard linearly averaged observables. Our framework naturally
adapts to more exotic quantum critical points and highlights opportunities for

received much less attention due to its large uncertainty. Here, we mainly
study the inverse Omori law based on a highly detailed Southern California

we develop a technique to identify mainshocks, foreshocks, and aftershocks. We
then find, based on a statistical procedure we developed, that the rate of
earthquakes is higher a few days prior to a mainshock. We find that this
increase is much smaller for a catalog with a magnitude threshold of m over 2.5

used with a small magnitude threshold. We also analyze the rate of aftershocks
after mainshocks and find that the Omori-Utsu law does not hold for many
individual mainshocks and that it may be valid only statistically when
considering many mainshocks together. Yet, the analysis of the ETAS model based
on the Omori-Utsu law exhibits similar behavior as that of the real catalogs,

presented. Additional analyses of participants' ratings of the robot's
anthropomorphism, animacy and likeability further add to the impression that
presence does not play a significant role in simple gaze based interactions.

However, these classifiers have an Achilles heel, concept drift: they rapidly
become out of date and ineffective, due to the evolution of malware apps and
benign apps. Our research finds that, after training an Android malware
classifier on one year's worth of data, the F1 score quickly dropped from 0.99
to 0.76 after 6 months of deployment on new test samples.
  In this paper, we propose new methods to combat the concept drift problem of
Android malware classifiers. Since machine learning technique needs to be
continuously deployed, we use active learning: we select new samples for
analysts to label, and then add the labeled samples to the training set to
retrain the classifier. Our key idea is, similarity-based uncertainty is more
robust against concept drift. Therefore, we combine contrastive learning with
active learning. We propose a new hierarchical contrastive learning scheme, and
a new sample selection technique to continuously train the Android malware
classifier. Our evaluation shows that this leads to significant improvements,
compared to previously published methods for active learning. Our approach
reduces the false negative rate from 16% (for the best baseline) to 10%, while
maintaining the same false positive rate (0.6%). Also, our approach maintains
more consistent performance across a seven-year time period than past methods.

of end-to-end Imitation Learning models such as Behavioral Cloning, as well as
the lack of an explicit state-value representation, make it difficult to

two popular plagiarism detection tools were used to evaluate the originality of
50 essays generated by ChatGPT on various topics. Our results manifest that
ChatGPT has a great potential to generate sophisticated text outputs without
being well caught by the plagiarism check software. In other words, ChatGPT can
create content on many topics with high originality as if they were written by
someone. These findings align with the recent concerns about students using
chatbots for an easy shortcut to success with minimal or no effort. Moreover,
ChatGPT was asked to verify if the essays were generated by itself, as an
additional measure of plagiarism check, and it showed superior performance
compared to the traditional plagiarism-detection tools. The paper discusses the
need for institutions to consider appropriate measures to mitigate potential
plagiarism issues and advise on the ongoing debate surrounding the impact of AI

system. We consider and computationally model mechanisms by which humoral
memory present at baseline might instead increase infection load; we refer to
this effect as EI-HM (enhancement of infection by humoral memory). We first
consider antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) in which antibody enhances the
growth of the pathogen, typically a virus, and typically at intermediate
""Goldilocks"" levels of antibody. Our ADE model reproduces ADE in vitro and
enhancement of infection in vivo from passive antibody transfer. But notably
the simplest implementation of our ADE model never results in EI-HM. Adding
complexity, by making the cross-reactive antibody much less neutralizing than
the de novo generated antibody or by including a sufficiently strong
non-antibody immune response, allows for ADE-mediated EI-HM. We next consider
the possibility that cross-reactive memory causes EI-HM by crowding out a
possibly superior de novo immune response. We show that, even without ADE,
EI-HM can occur when the cross-reactive response is both less potent and
""directly"" (i.e. independently of infection load) suppressive with regard to
the de novo response. In this case adding a non-antibody immune response to our
computational model greatly reduces or completely eliminates EI-HM, which
suggests that ""crowding out"" is unlikely to cause substantial EI-HM. Hence, our
results provide examples in which simple models give qualitatively opposite
results compared to models with plausible complexity. Our results may be
helpful in interpreting and reconciling disparate experimental findings,
especially from dengue, and for vaccination.

Representation Learning (CRL) and Active Learning is proposed to handle the
challenge of using semi-supervised learning for text classification. In this
method, supervised (CRL) is used to train a RoBERTa transformer model to encode
the textual data into a contrastive representation space and then classify
using a classification layer. This (CRL)-based transformer model is used as the
base model in the proposed Active Learning mechanism to classify all the data
in an iterative manner. The proposed model is evaluated using unstructured
obituary data with objective to determine the cause of the death from the data.
This model is compared with the CRL model and an Active Learning model with the
RoBERTa base model. The experiment shows that the proposed method can
outperform both methods for this specific task.

execution scenarios (for computing outputs/gradients with different
implementations). We have implemented $\nabla$Fuzz as a fully automated
API-level fuzzer targeting AD in DL libraries, which utilizes differential
testing on different execution scenarios to test both first-order and
high-order gradients, and also includes automated filtering strategies to
remove false positives caused by numerical instability. We have performed an
extensive study on four of the most popular and actively-maintained DL
libraries, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and OneFlow. The result shows that
$\nabla$Fuzz substantially outperforms state-of-the-art fuzzers in terms of
both code coverage and bug detection. To date, $\nabla$Fuzz has detected 173
bugs for the studied DL libraries, with 144 already confirmed by developers

Remarkably, $\nabla$Fuzz contributed 58.3% (7/12) of all high-priority AD bugs

behavior and informing marketing or operational strategies, policy design, and
product development. The identification of parametric choice-based demand
models is typically straightforward. However, nonparametric models, which are
highly effective and flexible in explaining customer choice, may encounter the
challenge of the dimensionality curse, hindering their identification. A
prominent example of a nonparametric model is the ranking-based model, which
mirrors the random utility maximization (RUM) class and is known to be
nonidentifiable from the collection of choice probabilities alone. Our
objective in this paper is to develop a new class of nonparametric models that
is not subject to the problem of nonidentifiability. Our model assumes bounded
rationality of consumers, which results in symmetric demand cannibalization and
intriguingly enables full identification. Additionally, our choice model
demonstrates competitive prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
benchmarks in a real-world case study, despite incorporating the assumption of
bounded rationality which could, in theory, limit the representation power of
our model.
  In addition, we tackle the important problem of finding the optimal
assortment under the proposed choice model. We demonstrate the NP-hardness of
this problem and provide a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme through
dynamic programming. Additionally, we propose an efficient estimation framework
using a combination of column generation and expectation-maximization
algorithms, which proves to be more tractable than the estimation algorithm of
the aforementioned ranking-based model.

We study three types of representations that are trained on the graph, i.e.,

as a critical metric in reinforcement learning (RL), in addition to the
standard metric of losses (or rewards). However, existing studies on switching
costs (with a coefficient $\beta$ that is strictly positive and is independent
of $T$) have mainly focused on static RL, where the loss distribution is
assumed to be fixed during the learning process, and thus practical scenarios
where the loss distribution could be non-stationary or even adversarial are not
considered. While adversarial RL better models this type of practical
scenarios, an open problem remains: how to develop a provably efficient
algorithm for adversarial RL with switching costs? This paper makes the first
effort towards solving this problem. First, we provide a regret lower-bound
that shows that the regret of any algorithm must be larger than
$\tilde{\Omega}( ( H S A )^{1/3} T^{2/3} )$, where $T$, $S$, $A$ and $H$ are
the number of episodes, states, actions and layers in each episode,
respectively. Our lower bound indicates that, due to the fundamental challenge
of switching costs in adversarial RL, the best achieved regret (whose
dependency on $T$ is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$) in static RL with switching costs
(as well as adversarial RL without switching costs) is no longer achievable.
Moreover, we propose two novel switching-reduced algorithms with regrets that
match our lower bound when the transition function is known, and match our
lower bound within a small factor of $\tilde{O}( H^{1/3} )$ when the transition
function is unknown. Our regret analysis demonstrates the near-optimal
performance of them.

  Instantaneous Hard Constraints","Submitted for publication",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), it is critically
important that the algorithm performs safely, such that instantaneous hard
constraints are satisfied at each step, and unsafe states and actions are
avoided. However, existing algorithms for ''safe'' RL are often designed under
constraints that either require expected cumulative costs to be bounded or
assume all states are safe. Thus, such algorithms could violate instantaneous
hard constraints and traverse unsafe states (and actions) in practice.
Therefore, in this paper, we develop the first near-optimal safe RL algorithm
for episodic Markov Decision Processes with unsafe states and actions under
instantaneous hard constraints and the linear mixture model. It not only
achieves a regret $\tilde{O}(\frac{d H^3 \sqrt{dK}}{\Delta_c})$ that tightly
matches the state-of-the-art regret in the setting with only unsafe actions and
nearly matches that in the unconstrained setting, but is also safe at each
step, where $d$ is the feature-mapping dimension, $K$ is the number of
episodes, $H$ is the number of steps in each episode, and $\Delta_c$ is a
safety-related parameter. We also provide a lower bound
$\tilde{\Omega}(\max\{dH \sqrt{K}, \frac{H}{\Delta_c^2}\})$, which indicates
that the dependency on $\Delta_c$ is necessary. Further, both our algorithm
design and regret analysis involve several novel ideas, which may be of
independent interest.

elucidate the functional consequences of ER network structure and dynamics, we
quantify how the heterogeneity of the peripheral ER in COS7 cells affects

proteins demonstrates their non-uniform spreading to adjacent regions, in a
manner consistent with simulations of diffusing particles on extracted network

we demonstrate that ER network dynamics are sufficiently slow to have little

reveal a novel consequence of ER network heterogeneity: the existence of 'hot

Intriguingly, ER exit sites are disproportionately found in these highly

Concerningly, this work demonstrates that the certification mechanisms

exploited by attackers to construct smaller adversarial perturbations. While
these attacks exist outside the certification region in no way invalidate
certifications, minimising a perturbation's norm significantly increases the
level of difficulty associated with attack detection. In comparison to baseline

standard NRLs that leverage structural information from a graph proceed by
first encoding pairwise relationships into learned representations and then
analysing its properties. This approach is fundamentally misaligned with
problems where the relationships involve multiple points, and topological
structure must be encoded beyond pairwise interactions. Fortunately, the
machinery of topological data analysis (TDA) and, in particular, simplicial
neural networks (SNNs) offer a mathematically rigorous framework to learn
higher-order interactions between nodes. It is critical to investigate if the
representation outputs from SNNs are more vulnerable compared to regular
representation outputs from graph neural networks (GNNs) via pairwise
interactions. In my dissertation, I will first study learning the
representations with text attributes for simplicial complexes (RT4SC) via SNNs.
Then, I will conduct research on two potential attacks on the representation
outputs from SNNs: (1) membership inference attack, which infers whether a
certain node of a graph is inside the training data of the GNN model; and (2)
graph reconstruction attacks, which infer the confidential edges of a

deterministic differentially private alternating direction method of multiplier
to learn secure representation outputs from SNNs that capture multi-scale
relationships and facilitate the passage from local structure to global
invariant features on text-attributed networks.

a small amount of mass ($\lesssim6\times10^{-7} M_\odot$) moving

paradigms on their head by seeking to understand what properties arise in the
presence of profound configurational disorder. This disorder, which originates
from multiple elements sharing a single lattice site, can take on a
kaleidoscopic character due to the vast numbers of possible elemental
combinations. High configurational disorder appears to imbue some HEOs with
functional properties that far surpass their non-disordered analogs. While
experimental discoveries abound, efforts to characterize the true magnitude of
the configurational entropy and understand its role in stabilizing new phases

the role of configurational disorder in existing HEOs is the crucial link to

alleviates class imbalance in object detection by down-weighting the loss of
well-classified examples. Recent research has shown that these two loss
functions derived from cross entropy have valuable applications in the field of
image segmentation. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no unified
formulation that combines these two loss functions so that they can not only be

into the regularizer-based entropy loss and the focal-based entropy loss, and
propose a novel optimized hybrid focal loss to handle extreme class imbalance

from 90 Compact Binary Coalescences. In addition to fortifying the linearized
theory of General Relativity (GR), the statistical ensemble of detections also
provides prospects of detecting nonlinear effects predicted by GR, one such
prediction being the nonlinear gravitational memory effect. For detected
stellar and intermediate mass compact binaries, the induced strain from the
memory effect is one or two orders below the detector noise background.
Additionally, since most of the energy is radiated at merger the strain induced
by the memory effect resembles a step function at the merger time. These facts
motivate the idea of coherently stacking up data streams from recorded GW
events at these merger times so that the cumulative memory strain is detected
with a sufficient SNR. GW detectors essentially record the integrated strain
response at time scales of the round trip light travel time, making future
space-based long arm interferometers like LISA ideal for detecting the memory
effect at low frequencies. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
event catalog of ground-based detectors and searches for corresponding memory
strains in the LISA data stream. Given LVK's O3 science run catalog, we use
scaling arguments and assumptions on the source population models to estimate
the run time required for LISA to accumulate a memory SNR of 5, using triggers
from current and future ground-based detectors. Finally, we extend these
calculations for using beyond LISA missions like ALIA, AMIGO, and Folkner to
detect the gravitational memory effect. The results for LISA indicate a
possible detection of the memory effect within the 10 year LISA mission
lifetime and the corresponding results for beyond LISA missions are even more
promising.

to minimize the gap (difference of max to average load). The One-Choice process
places each ball to a bin sampled independently and uniformly at random. The
Two-Choice process places balls in the least loaded of two sampled bins.
Finally, the $(1+\beta)$-process mixes these processes, meaning each ball is
allocated using Two-Choice with probability $\beta\in(0,1)$, and using
One-Choice otherwise.
  Despite Two-Choice being optimal in the sequential setting, it has been
observed in practice that it does not perform well in a parallel environment,
where load information may be outdated. Following [BCEFN12], we study such a
parallel setting where balls are allocated in batches of size $b$, and balls
within the same batch are allocated with the same strategy and based on the
same load information.
  For small batch sizes $b\in[n,n\log n]$, it was shown in [LS22a] that
Two-Choice achieves an asymptotically optimal gap among all processes with a
constant number of samples.
  In this work, we focus on larger batch sizes $b\in[n\log n,n^3]$. It was
proved in [LS22c] that Two-Choice leads to a gap of $\Theta(b/n)$. As our main
result, we prove that the gap reduces to $O(\sqrt{(b/n)\cdot\log n})$, if one
runs the $(1+\beta)$-process with an appropriately chosen $\beta$ (in fact this
result holds for a larger class of processes). This not only proves the
phenomenon that Two-Choice is not the best (leading to the formation of
""towers"" over previously light bins), but also that mixing two processes
(One-Choice and Two-Choice) leads to a process which achieves a gap that is
asymptotically smaller than both. We also derive a matching lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{(b/n)\cdot\log n})$ for any allocation process, which
demonstrates that the above $(1+\beta)$-process is asymptotically optimal.

the fuel that feeds dynamical processes that sustain life. At the same time,
anisotropy is a root cause of incurred losses manifested as entropy production.
In this work we consider a rudimentary model of an overdamped stochastic
thermodynamic system in an anisotropic temperature heat bath, and study minimum
entropy production when driving the system between thermodynamic states in
finite time. While entropy production in isotropic temperature environments can
be expressed in terms of the length (in the Wasserstein-2 metric) traversed by
the thermodynamic state of the system, anisotropy complicates substantially the
mechanism of entropy production since, besides dissipation, seepage of energy
between ambient anisotropic heat sources by way of the system dynamics is often
a major contributing factor. A key result of the paper is to show that in the
presence of anisotropy, minimization of entropy production can once again be
expressed via a modified Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) problem. However, in
contrast to the isotropic situation that leads to a classical OMT problem and a
Wasserstein length, entropy production may not be identically zero when the
thermodynamic state remains unchanged (unless one has control over
non-conservative forces); this is due to the fact that maintaining a
Non-Equilibrium Steady-State (NESS) incurs an intrinsic entropic cost that can
be traced back to a seepage of heat between heat baths. As alluded to, NESSs
represent hallmarks of life, since living matter by necessity operates far from
equilibrium. Therefore, the question studied herein, to characterize minimal
entropy production in anisotropic environments, appears of central importance
in biological processes and on how such processes may have evolved to optimize
for available usage of resources.

hardware model, an active STAR-RIS-aided two-user downlink communication system
is investigated. Closed-form expressions are obtained for the outage
probabilities of both the coupled and independent phase-shift scenarios. To
obtain further insights, scaling laws and diversity orders are derived for both
users. Analytical results confirm that active STAR-RIS achieves the same
diversity orders as passive ones while their scaling laws are different. It is
proved that average received SNRs scale with M and M^2 for active and passive
STAR-RISs, respectively. Numerical results show that active STAR-RISs
outperform passive STAR-RISs in terms of outage probability especially when the
number of elements is small.

introducing a dynamic equation for the auxiliary variable and reformulating the
original equations into an equivalent system, we construct first- and
second-order semi-implicit linearized schemes for the underlying problem. The
main advantages of the proposed method are: (1) the schemes are unconditionally
stable in the sense that a discrete energy keeps decay during the time
stepping; (2) the concentration components of the discrete solution preserve
positivity and mass conservation; (3) the delicate implementation shows that
the proposed schemes can be very efficiently realized, with computational
complexity close to a semi-implicit scheme. Some numerical examples are
presented to demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the proposed method.

key technological enablers for beyond-5G wireless networks, improving
localization and communication performance under line-of-sight (LoS) blockage
conditions. However, hardware imperfections might cause RIS elements to become
faulty, a problem referred to as pixel failures, which can constitute a major
showstopper especially for localization. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of RIS-aided localization of a user equipment (UE) under LoS blockage
in the presence of RIS pixel failures, considering the challenging single-input
single-output (SISO) scenario. We first explore the impact of such failures on
accuracy through misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB) analysis, which reveals
severe performance loss with even a small percentage of pixel failures. To
remedy this issue, we develop two strategies for joint localization and failure
diagnosis (JLFD) to detect failing pixels while simultaneously locating the UE
with high accuracy. The first strategy relies on l_1-regularization through
exploitation of failure sparsity. The second strategy detects the failures
one-by-one by solving a multiple hypothesis testing problem at each iteration,
successively enhancing localization and diagnosis accuracy. Simulation results
show significant performance improvements of the proposed JLFD algorithms over
the conventional failure-agnostic benchmark, enabling successful recovery of
failure-induced performance degradations.

chemistry, sparse benchmarking is available to guide users on appropriate level
of theory and basis set choices (model chemistry). Here, we assess the
performance of over 600 model chemistries in scaled harmonic frequencies
calculations evaluating different scaling factors types.
  We can summarise our results into three main findings: (1) using model
chemistry-specific scaling factors optimised for three different frequency
regions (low (below 1,000cm-1), mid (1,000-2,000cm-1), and high (above
2,000cm-1)) results in better agreement between the scaled harmonic and
experimental frequencies compared to other choices; (2) larger basis sets and
more robust levels of theory generally lead to superior performance; however,
the particular model chemistry choice matters; and (3) outliers should be
expected in routine calculations.
  In terms of specific recommendations, overall, the highest accuracy model
chemistries are double-hybrid functionals with non-Pople augmented triple-zeta
basis sets, which can produce median frequency errors of down to 7.6cm-1
(DSD-PBEP86/def2-TZVPD) lying close to the error in the harmonic approximation.
Double-zeta basis sets should not be used with double-hybrid functionals as
there is no improvement compared to hybrid functionals. Note that the 6-311G*
and 6-311+G* bases perform like double-zeta basis sets for vibrational
frequencies.
  After scaling, all studied hybrid functionals with non-Pople triple-zeta
basis sets will produce median errors of less than 15cm-1, with the best result
of 9.9cm-1 with B97-1/def2-TZVPD. Appropriate matching of double-zeta basis
sets with hybrid functionals can produce high quality results. The B97-1,
TPSS0-D3(BJ) or wB97X-D hybrid functionals with 6-31G*, pc-1 or pcseg-1 are
recommended for fast routine calculations, all delivering median errors of

bit-widths to different data qualities. The adaption is based on a bit-width
decision policy that can be learned jointly with the quantization training.
Concretely, DQMQ is modeled as a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) task that
combines model-based policy optimization with supervised quantization training.
By relaxing the discrete bit-width sampling to a continuous probability
distribution that is encoded with few learnable parameters, DQMQ is
differentiable and can be directly optimized end-to-end with a hybrid
optimization target considering both task performance and quantization
benefits. Trained on mixed-quality image datasets, DQMQ can implicitly select
the most proper bit-width for each layer when facing uneven input qualities.
Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets and networks demonstrate
the superiority of DQMQ against existing fixed/mixed-precision quantization
methods.

remarkable detection performance. Although DU has a lesser number of trainable

complexities related to training and execution have been problematic because
DU-based MIMO detectors usually utilize matrix inversion to improve their

them to study the performance of the Sum of Squares (SoS) hierarchy on

  The SoS hierarchy is a powerful optimization technique that has achieved
tremendous success for various problems in combinatorial optimization, robust
statistics and machine learning. It's a family of convex relaxations that lets
us smoothly trade off running time for approximation guarantees. In recent
works, it's been shown to be extremely useful for recovering structure in high
dimensional noisy data. It also remains our best approach towards refuting the
notorious Unique Games Conjecture.
  In this work, we analyze the performance of the SoS hierarchy on fundamental
problems stemming from statistics, theoretical computer science and statistical
physics. In particular, we show subexponential-time SoS lower bounds for the
problems of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonian, Planted Slightly Denser
Subgraph, Tensor Principal Components Analysis and Sparse Principal Components
Analysis. These SoS lower bounds involve analyzing large random matrices,
wherein lie our main contributions. These results offer strong evidence for the
truth of and insight into the low-degree likelihood ratio hypothesis, an
important conjecture that predicts the power of bounded-time algorithms for
hypothesis testing.
  We also develop general-purpose tools for analyzing the behavior of random
matrices which are functions of independent random variables. Towards this, we
build on and generalize the matrix variant of the Efron-Stein inequalities. In
particular, our general theorem on matrix concentration recovers various
results that have appeared in the literature. We expect these random matrix

of merger remnants can result from different kinds of minor and major mergers,
and estimate the fraction of early-type galaxies in the local universe with
evidence of recent major (27%) and minor (57%) mergers. The merger fractions
deduced are higher than in several earlier surveys. Among remnants, we find
that shells are the dominant merger debris (54%) associated with early-type
galaxies, resulting from both major and minor mergers, with those
characteristics of major mergers being significant (24% of shell host
galaxies). The most uncommon merger-related structures are boxy isophotes of
the stellar distribution and the presence of disk fragments near the cores of
galaxies. We develop a classification scheme for these fine structures that may

primarily based on the mass ratios of the merged galaxies. This work, when

Each string $x$ is decomposed into blocks that can be described by grammars of

uses the same number of grammars and the $i$-th grammar of $x$ is the same as
the $i$-th grammar of $y$ except for at most $k$ indexes $i$. The edit distance
of $x$ and $y$ equals to the sum of edit distances of pairs of blocks where $x$

$\widetilde{O}(k^2)$ for edit distance, and also a rolling sketch for edit

a wide range of applications, including agriculture, urban planning, and

learning models on these geospatial tasks, various works have begun
investigating foundation models for this domain. Researchers have explored two
prominent approaches for introducing such models in geospatial applications,
but both have drawbacks in terms of limited performance benefit or prohibitive
training cost. Therefore, in this work, we propose a novel paradigm for
building highly effective geospatial foundation models with minimal resource
cost and carbon impact. We first construct a compact yet diverse dataset from
multiple sources to promote feature diversity, which we term GeoPile. Then, we
investigate the potential of continual pretraining from large-scale
ImageNet-22k models and propose a multi-objective continual pretraining
paradigm, which leverages the strong representations of ImageNet while
simultaneously providing the freedom to learn valuable in-domain features. Our
approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods
in an extensive evaluation on seven downstream datasets covering various tasks
such as change detection, classification, multi-label classification, semantic
segmentation, and super-resolution.

platform revenue. Since different consumers might respond differently to
incentives, individual-level budget allocation is an essential task in
marketing campaigns. Recent advances in this field often address the budget
allocation problem using a two-stage paradigm: the first stage estimates the
individual-level treatment effects using causal inference algorithms, and the
second stage invokes integer programming techniques to find the optimal budget
allocation solution. Since the objectives of these two stages might not be
perfectly aligned, such a two-stage paradigm could hurt the overall marketing
effectiveness.
  In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework to directly optimize
the business goal under budget constraints. Our core idea is to construct a
regularizer to represent the marketing goal and optimize it efficiently using
gradient estimation techniques. As such, the obtained models can learn to
maximize the marketing goal directly and precisely. We extensively evaluate our
proposed method in both offline and online experiments, and experimental

quantum-classical algorithm used to approximately solve combinatorial
optimisation problems. It involves multiple iterations of a parameterised
ansatz that consists of a problem and mixer Hamiltonian, with the parameters
being classically optimised. While QAOA can be implemented on near-term quantum
hardware, physical limitations such as gate noise, restricted qubit
connectivity, and state-preparation-and-measurement (SPAM) errors can limit
circuit depth and decrease performance. To address these limitations, this work
introduces the eXpressive QAOA (XQAOA), a modified version of QAOA that assigns
more classical parameters to the ansatz to improve the performance of low-depth
quantum circuits. XQAOA includes an additional Pauli-Y component in the mixer
Hamiltonian, thereby allowing the mixer to implement arbitrary unitary
transformations on each qubit. To benchmark the performance of the XQAOA ansatz
at low depth, we derive its closed-form expression for the MaxCut problem and
compare it to QAOA, Multi-Angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), a Classical-Relaxed (CR)
algorithm, and the state-of-the-art Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm on a set
of unweighted regular graphs with 128 and 256 nodes and degrees ranging from 3
to 10. Our results show that XQAOA performs better than QAOA, MA-QAOA, and the
CR algorithm on all graphs and outperforms the GW algorithm on graphs with
degrees greater than 4. Additionally, we find an infinite family of graphs for
which XQAOA solves MaxCut exactly and show analytically that for some graphs in
this family, special cases of XQAOA can achieve a larger approximation ratio
than QAOA. Overall, XQAOA is a more viable choice for implementing quantum
combinatorial optimisation on near-term quantum devices, as it can achieve
better results with a single iteration, despite requiring additional classical

a high or low activity threshold, respectively. As more memories are stored,
the dense representation at low threshold shifts from examples to concepts,
which are learned from accumulating common example features. Meanwhile, the
sparse representation at high threshold maintains distinctions between examples
due to the high capacity of sparse, decorrelated patterns. Thus, a single
network can retrieve memories at both example and concept scales and perform
heteroassociation between them. We obtain our results by deriving macroscopic
mean-field equations that yield capacity formulas for sparse examples, dense

The accurate extraction of $\rho_{t}$ through the future gravitational wave

MMPA (Mobile Manipulator Process Automation with One-shot Teaching). Currently,
there is no effective and robust MMPA framework which is not influenced by

proposed MMPA framework consists of two stages: collecting data (mobile base's
location, environment information, end-effector's path) in the teaching stage
for robot learning; letting the end-effector repeat the nearly same path as the
reference path in the world frame to reproduce the work in the automation
stage. More specifically, in the automation stage, the robot navigates to the
specified location without the need of a precise parking. Then, based on
colored point cloud registration, the proposed IPE (Iterative Pose Estimation
by Eye & Hand) algorithm could estimate the accurate 6D relative parking pose
of the robot arm base without the need of any marker. Finally, the robot could
learn the error compensation from the parking pose's bias to modify the
end-effector's path to make it repeat a nearly same path in the world
coordinate system as recorded in the teaching stage. Hundreds of trials have
been conducted with a real mobile manipulator to show the superior robustness

transition, together with a CDW gap. In experiments, the short-ranged CDW with
small domains is often associated with defects, thus making it difficult to

proximity of the models to the Eddington limit. We find that the majority of
systems undergo mass transfer during core hydrogen burning. During the ensuing
nuclear timescale evolution, many mass donors remain more massive than their
companions (``reverse Algols''), and nuclear timescale mass transfer may be
interrupted or absent altogether. Furthermore, due to the elevated
luminosity-to-mass ratio, many of the core-hydrogen burning donors may develop
Wolf-Rayet-type winds, at luminosities where single stars would not. We
identify observational counterparts of very massive reverse Algol binaries in
the LMC, and discuss their contribution to the observed hydrogen-rich
Wolf-Rayet stars. We argue that an understanding of very massive Algol systems

(RS) platforms can provide the necessary data sources for the 3D reconstruction
of large-scale landforms and cities. Even with low-altitude UAVs (Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles), 3D reconstruction in complicated situations, such as urban
canyons and indoor scenes, is challenging due to frequent tracking failures
between camera frames and high data collection costs. Recently, spherical
images have been extensively used due to the capability of recording
surrounding environments from one camera exposure. In contrast to perspective
images with limited FOV (Field of View), spherical images can cover the whole
scene with full horizontal and vertical FOV and facilitate camera tracking and
data acquisition in these complex scenes. With the rapid evolution and
extensive use of professional and consumer-grade spherical cameras, spherical
images show great potential for the 3D modeling of urban and indoor scenes.
Classical 3D reconstruction pipelines, however, cannot be directly used for
spherical images. Besides, there exist few software packages that are designed
for the 3D reconstruction of spherical images. As a result, this research
provides a thorough survey of the state-of-the-art for 3D reconstruction of
spherical images in terms of data acquisition, feature detection and matching,
image orientation, and dense matching as well as presenting promising
applications and discussing potential prospects. We anticipate that this study
offers insightful clues to direct future research.

seeks to infuse algorithmic computation in neural networks, typically by
training neural models to approximate steps of classical algorithms. In this
context, much of the current work has focused on learning reachability and
shortest path graph algorithms, showing that joint learning on similar
algorithms is beneficial for generalisation. However, when targeting more
complex problems, such similar algorithms become more difficult to find. Here,
we propose to learn algorithms by exploiting duality of the underlying
algorithmic problem. Many algorithms solve optimisation problems. We
demonstrate that simultaneously learning the dual definition of these
optimisation problems in algorithmic learning allows for better learning and
qualitatively better solutions. Specifically, we exploit the max-flow min-cut
theorem to simultaneously learn these two algorithms over synthetically
generated graphs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We
then validate the real-world utility of our dual algorithmic reasoner by
deploying it on a challenging brain vessel classification task, which likely
depends on the vessels' flow properties. We demonstrate a clear performance
gain when using our model within such a context, and empirically show that
learning the max-flow and min-cut algorithms together is critical for achieving
such a result.

two-step positioning scheme is exploited, where the channel parameters are
first acquired, and the position-related parameters are then estimated. The
channel parameters are obtained through a coarser and a subsequent finer
estimation processes. As for the coarse estimation, the distributed compressed
sensing orthogonal simultaneous matching pursuit (DCS-SOMP) algorithm, the
maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm, and the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) are
utilized to separately estimate the channel parameters. The obtained channel
parameters are then jointly refined by using the space-alternating generalized
expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm, which circumvents the
high-dimensional optimization issue of ML estimation. Departing from the
estimated channel parameters, the positioning-related parameters are estimated.
The performance of estimating the channel-related and position-related

(CRLB). Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed

to ensure database consistency. With the use of commodity compute nodes and
networks, failures such as system crashes and network partitioning are common.
It is therefore important for ACP to dynamically adapt to the operating
condition for efficiency while ensuring the consistency of the database.
Existing ACPs often assume stable operating conditions, hence, they are either
non-generalizable to different environments or slow in practice.
  In this paper, we propose a novel and practical ACP, called Failure-Aware
Atomic Commit (FLAC). In essence, FLAC includes three protocols, which are
specifically designed for three different environments: (i) no failure occurs,
(ii) participant nodes might crash but there is no delayed connection, or (iii)
both crashed nodes and delayed connection can occur. It models these
environments as the failure-free, crash-failure, and network-failure robustness
levels. During its operation, FLAC can monitor if any failure occurs and
dynamically switch to operate the most suitable protocol, using a robustness
level state machine, whose parameters are fine-tuned by reinforcement learning.
Consequently, it improves both the response time and throughput, and
effectively handles nodes distributed across the Internet where crash and
network failures might occur. We implement FLAC in a distributed transactional
key-value storage system based on Google Percolator and evaluate its
performance with both a micro benchmark and a macro benchmark of real workload.
The results show that FLAC achieves up to 2.22x throughput improvement and
2.82x latency speedup, compared to existing ACPs for high-contention workloads.

However, recent studies in the vision and NLP fields show that the role of
attention modules is not clear, which can be replaced by other token

deficiencies of attention mechanisms on the performance of time series
forecasting. Specifically, we find that (1) attention is not necessary for
capturing temporal dependencies, (2) the entanglement and redundancy in the
capture of temporal and channel interaction affect the forecasting performance,
and (3) it is important to model the mapping between the input and the

factorized modules to capture temporal and channel dependencies. Experimental
results on several real-world datasets show that MTS-Mixers outperform existing

reduced shear approximation, magnification bias, source-lens clustering, source
obscuration, local Universe effects, and the flat Universe assumption. Upon
computing these explicitly, and calculating their cosmological parameter
biases, using a maximum multipole of $\ell=5000$, we find that the
magnification bias, source-lens clustering, source obscuration, and local
Universe terms individually produce significant ($\,>0.25\sigma$) cosmological
biases in one or more parameters, and accordingly must be accounted for. In
total, over all effects, we find biases in $\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\Omega_{\rm b}$,
$h$, and $\sigma_{8}$ of $0.73\sigma$, $0.28\sigma$, $0.25\sigma$, and
$-0.79\sigma$, respectively, for flat $\Lambda$CDM. For the $w_0w_a$CDM case,

increased relative to the $\Lambda$CDM due to additional degeneracies as a

dataset. We propose a new framework based on the augmented covariance extracted
from an autoregressive model to improve motor imagery classification. Methods:
From the autoregressive model can be derived the Yule-Walker equations, which
show the emergence of a symmetric positive definite matrix: the augmented
covariance matrix. The state-of the art for classifying covariance matrices is
based on Riemannian Geometry. A fairly natural idea is therefore to extend the
standard approach using these augmented covariance matrices. The methodology
for creating the augmented covariance matrix shows a natural connection with
the delay embedding theorem proposed by Takens for dynamical systems. Such an
embedding method is based on the knowledge of two parameters: the delay and the
embedding dimension, respectively related to the lag and the order of the
autoregressive model. This approach provides new methods to compute the
hyper-parameters in addition to standard grid search. Results: The augmented
covariance matrix performed noticeably better than any state-of-the-art
methods. We will test our approach on several datasets and several subjects
using the MOABB framework, using both within-session and cross-session
evaluation. Conclusion: The improvement in results is due to the fact that the
augmented covariance matrix incorporates not only spatial but also temporal
information, incorporating nonlinear components of the signal through an
embedding procedure, which allows the leveraging of dynamical systems
algorithms. Significance: These results extend the concepts and the results of
the Riemannian distance based classification algorithm.

fundamental and dynamic properties of magnetic materials. So far single shot
magnetic switching has been limited to ferrimagnetic alloys and multilayers. In
ferromagnetic (FM)/antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayers, exchange bias (He) arises
from the interfacial exchange coupling between the two layers and reflects the
microscopic orientation of the antiferromagnet. Here we demonstrate the
possibility of single shot switching of the antiferromagnet (change of the sign
and amplitude of He) with a single femtosecond laser pulse in IrMn/CoGd
bilayers. We demonstrate the switching for a wide range of fluences for
different layer thicknesses and compositions. Atomistic simulations predict
ultrafast switching and recovery of the AFM magnetization on a timescale of 2
ps. These results provide the fastest and the most energy-efficient method to
set the exchange bias and pave the way to potential applications for ultrafast
spintronic devices.

exposure to EMF and enhancing the network coverage performance. Then, we
formulate optimization problems to maximize the performance of the EMF-aware

years worldwide. Many accidents are caused by distracted drivers, who take
their attention away from driving. Motivated by the success of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision, many researchers developed CNN-based
algorithms to recognize distracted driving from a dashcam and warn the driver
against unsafe behaviors. However, current models have too many parameters,
which is unfeasible for vehicle-mounted computing. This work proposes a novel
knowledge-distillation-based framework to solve this problem. The proposed
framework first constructs a high-performance teacher network by progressively
strengthening the robustness to illumination changes from shallow to deep
layers of a CNN. Then, the teacher network is used to guide the architecture
searching process of a student network through knowledge distillation. After
that, we use the teacher network again to transfer knowledge to the student
network by knowledge distillation. Experimental results on the Statefarm
Distracted Driver Detection Dataset and AUC Distracted Driver Dataset show that
the proposed approach is highly effective for recognizing distracted driving
behaviors from photos: (1) the teacher network's accuracy surpasses the
previous best accuracy; (2) the student network achieves very high accuracy
with only 0.42M parameters (around 55% of the previous most lightweight model).
Furthermore, the student network architecture can be extended to a
spatial-temporal 3D CNN for recognizing distracted driving from video clips.
The 3D student network largely surpasses the previous best accuracy with only
2.03M parameters on the Drive&Act Dataset. The source code is available at

domains that require critical decision-making, such as healthcare and criminal

summary-explanation and its max-support (MS) problem have been proposed, which
can provide explanations for particular decisions along with useful statistics
of the dataset. However, globally-consistent summary-explanations with limited
complexity typically have small supports, if there are any. In this paper, we
propose a relaxed version of summary-explanation, i.e., the $q$-consistent
summary-explanation, which aims to achieve greater support at the cost of
slightly lower consistency. The challenge is that the max-support problem of
$q$-consistent summary-explanation (MSqC) is much more complex than the
original MS problem, resulting in over-extended solution time using standard
branch-and-bound solvers. To improve the solution time efficiency, this paper
proposes the weighted column sampling~(WCS) method based on solving smaller
problems by sampling variables according to their simplified increase support
(SIS) values. Experiments verify that solving MSqC with the proposed SIS-based
WCS method is not only more scalable in efficiency, but also yields solutions
with greater support and better global extrapolation effectiveness.

orthogonal, symplectic or unitary group for some odd prime number p.
FollowingArthur and Mok, there are a positive integer N, a p-adic field E and a
local functorial transfer from isomorphism classes of irreducible smooth
complex representations of G to those of GL(N,E). By fixing a prime number l
different from p and an isomorphism between the field of complex numbers and an
algebraic closure of the field of l-adic numbers, we obtain a transfer map
between representations with l-adic coefficients. Now consider a cuspidal
irreducible l-adic representation pi of G: we can define its reduction mod l,
which is a semi-simple smooth representation of G of finite length, with
coefficients in a field of characteristic l. Let pi' be a cuspidal irreducible
l-adic representation of G whose reduction mod l is isomorphic to that of pi.
We prove that the transfers of pi and pi' have reductions mod l which may not
be isomorphic, but which have isomorphic supercuspidal supports. When G is not
the split special orthogonal group SO(2), we further prove that the reductions
mod l of the transfers of pi and pi' share a unique common generic component.

red-visible (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS), and near-infrared

torques. These torques, like spin-orbit torques that occur when electrons are
injected from a heavy metal into a ferromagnet, can display both damping-like

the cumulative stochastic variance $\sigma_{1:T}^2$ and the cumulative
adversarial variation $\Sigma_{1:T}^2$ for convex functions. They also provide
a slightly weaker bound based on the maximal stochastic variance
$\sigma_{\max}^2$ and the maximal adversarial variation $\Sigma_{\max}^2$ for
strongly convex functions. Inspired by their work, we investigate the
theoretical guarantees of optimistic online mirror descent (OMD) for the SEA
model. For convex and smooth functions, we obtain the same
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sigma_{1:T}^2}+\sqrt{\Sigma_{1:T}^2})$ regret bound,
without the convexity requirement of individual functions. For strongly convex
and smooth functions, we establish an $\mathcal{O}(\min\{\log
(\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2), (\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T\})$
bound, better than their $\mathcal{O}((\sigma_{\max}^2 + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log
T)$ bound. For \mbox{exp-concave} and smooth functions, we achieve a new
$\mathcal{O}(d\log(\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ bound. Owing to the OMD
framework, we can further extend our result to obtain dynamic regret
guarantees, which are more favorable in non-stationary online scenarios. The
attained results allow us to recover excess risk bounds of the stochastic
setting and regret bounds of the adversarial setting, and derive new guarantees
for many intermediate scenarios.

content to their users; social media is a prime example. In turn,
recommendation systems largely depend on artificial intelligence algorithms to
decide who gets to see what. While the content social media platforms deliver
is as varied as the users who engage with them, it has been shown that
platforms can contribute to serious harm to individuals, groups and societies.
Studies have suggested that these negative impacts range from worsening an
individual's mental health to driving society-wide polarisation capable of
putting democracies at risk. To better safeguard people from these harms, the
European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) requires platforms, especially
those with large numbers of users, to make their algorithmic systems more
transparent and follow due diligence obligations. These requirements constitute
an important legislative step towards mitigating the systemic risks posed by
online platforms. However, the DSA lacks concrete guidelines to operationalise
a viable audit process that would allow auditors to hold these platforms
accountable. This void could foster the spread of 'audit-washing', that is,
platforms exploiting audits to legitimise their practices and neglect
responsibility.
  To fill this gap, we propose a risk-scenario-based audit process. We explain
in detail what audits and assessments of recommender systems according to the
DSA should look like. Our approach also considers the evolving nature of
platforms and emphasises the observability of their recommender systems'
components. The resulting audit facilitates internal (among audits of the same
system at different moments in time) and external comparability (among audits
of different platforms) while also affording the evaluation of mitigation
measures implemented by the platforms themselves.

brought much attention to 4d ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 as a magnetic Weyl
semimetal. Besides, the hump-like Hall effect anomaly, which might have a
topological origin, has also been reported for this material. Here, we show
that the emergence of such phenomena is governed by the degree of scattering
determined by the defect density (Ru-deficiency- and/or interface-driven-defect
scattering) and measurement temperature (phonon scattering), where the former
is controlled by varying the growth conditions of the SrRuO3 films in molecular
beam epitaxy as well as the film thickness. The resulting electronic transport
properties can be classified into three categories: clean, intermediate, and
dirty regimes. The transport of Weyl fermions emerges in the clean regime,
whereas that of topologically trivial conduction electrons in the ferromagnetic
metal state prevail in the intermediate and dirty regimes. In the clean and
intermediate regimes, anomalous Hall resistivity obeys a scaling law
incorporating the intrinsic Karplus-Luttinger (Berry phase) and extrinsic
side-jump mechanisms. The hump-like Hall effect anomaly is observed only in the
dirty regime, which is contrary to the scaling law between anomalous Hall
resistivity and longitudinal resistivity. Hence, we conclude that this anomaly
is not inherent to the material and does not have a topological origin. We also
provide defect- and temperature-dependent transport phase diagrams of
stoichiometric SrRuO3 and Ru-deficient SrRu0.7O3 where the appearance of Weyl
fermions and hump-like Hall effect anomaly are mapped. These diagrams may serve

requires an amount of space linear in the number of non-zeros, and lossy
compression of sparse matrices (e.g., Truncated SVD) typically requires an

propose NeuKron for compressing a sparse reorderable matrix into a
constant-size space. NeuKron generalizes Kronecker products using a recurrent
neural network with a constant number of parameters. NeuKron updates the
parameters so that a given matrix is approximated by the product and reorders
the rows and columns of the matrix to facilitate the approximation. The updates
take time linear in the number of non-zeros in the input matrix, and the
approximation of each entry can be retrieved in logarithmic time. We also
extend NeuKron to compress sparse reorderable tensors (e.g. multi-layer

contributed to the decline of crime incidence in the country. These results
imply that police surveillance activities in highly populated areas and
specific interventions to address sexual violence must be in place during
community lockdowns. The Philippine National Police should heighten its
campaign in violence against women and increase its workforce visibility
especially in remote and densely populated areas. The results of this study can
be used as input to local government units for developing programs and plans on
crime prevention. For future researches, it is recommended to conduct a
precinct level analysis for a closer look at crime surveillance.

management in the chip industry. Among them, the phase change heat transfer
devices such as heat pipes and vapour chambers have shown tremendous potential.
These devices rely on the physics of capillary-driven thin-film evaporation
which is inherently coupled with the design and optimization of the evaporator
wicks used in these devices. Here, we introduce a biomimetic evaporator wick
design inspired by the peristome of the Nepenthes alata that can achieve
significantly enhanced evaporative cooling. It consists of array of
micropillars with multiple wedges along the sidewall of each micropillar. The
efficacy of the wedged micropillar is evaluated based on a validated numerical
model on the metrics of dryout heat flux and effective heat transfer
coefficient. The wedge angle is chosen such that wedged micropillars cause
liquid filaments to rise along the micropillar vertical walls. This results in
a significant increase in thin-film area for evaporation. Additionally, the
large mean curvature of the liquid meniscus produces strong capillary pumping
pressure and simultaneously, the wedges increase the overall permeability of
the wick. Consequently, our model predicts that the wedged micropillar wick can
attain ~234% enhancement of dryout heat flux compared to a conventional
cylindrical micropillar wick of similar geometrical dimensions. Moreover, the
wedged micropillars can also attain higher effective heat transfer coefficient
under dryout conditions thus outperforming the cylindrical micropillar in terms
of heat transfer efficiency. Our study provide insight into the design and
capability of the biomimetic wedged micropillars as an efficient evaporator
wick for various thin-film evaporation applications.

for, it can introduce substantial bias in our analysis of the planetary
atmosphere. In this work we aim to determine how physically realistic and
complex our stellar models must be in order to accurately extract the planetary
parameters from transmission spectra. We explore which simplifying assumptions
about the host star are valid at first order and examine if these assumptions
break down in cases of extreme stellar activity. To do this, we use a more
complex stellar model (StARPA) as the input observation for a combined
stellar-planetary retrieval with TauREx3, in which the contamination is
accounted for using a simplified stellar model (ASteRA). Using the StARPA model
as a benchmark, we validate the use of ASteRA using a retrieval framework of 27
simulated, spot-contaminated transmission spectra to determine in which
conditions it performs most favourably. For cases of low to moderate stellar
activity ASteRA performs well, retrieving the planetary parameters with a high
degree of accuracy. For the most active cases some residual contamination
remains due to ASteRA neglecting the effect of limb darkening. Nevertheless,
using ASteRA presents a substantial improvement over neglecting the
contamination entirely, which can result in retrieved planetary parameters that
are incorrect by up to two orders of magnitude.

The communication graph of the agents is defined on a mesh-grid 2-D cylindrical

real-valued reaction-advection-diffusion 2-D partial differential equations
(PDEs) whose states represent the 3-D position coordinates of the agents. The
leader agents on the boundary suffer unknown actuator delay due to the
computation and information transmission time. We design a delay-adaptive
controller for the 2-D PDE by using PDE Backstepping combined with a Lyapunov
functional method, where the latter is used for the design of the delay update
law. In order to achieve distributed formation control, we also design a
boundary observer that estimates the positions of all the agents from the
measurement of the position of the leaders' neighbors. Capitalizing on our
recent result on the control of 1-D parabolic PDEs with unknown input delay, we
use Fourier series expansion to bridge the control of 1-D PDEs to that of 2-D

constructed to establish the closed-loop local boundedness of the system
trajectories in $H^2$ norm and asymptotic convergence for both state and output

  For melody extraction, accurate note transcription is the key enabling

rates as ""reliable"" is still a matter of dispute. What these varying criteria
have in common, however, is that they are rarely satisfied for crude estimates
in small area analysis settings, prompting the use of spatial models to improve
reliability. While reasonable, recent work has quantified the extent to which
popular models from the spatial statistics literature can overwhelm the
information contained in the data, leading to oversmoothing. Here, we begin by
providing a definition for a ""reliable"" estimate for event rates that can be
used for crude and model-based estimates and allows for discrete and continuous
statements of reliability. We then construct a spatial Bayesian framework that
allows users to infuse prior information into their models to improve
reliability while also guarding against oversmoothing. We apply our approach to
county-level birth data from Pennsylvania, highlighting the effect of
oversmoothing in spatial models and how our approach can allow users to better
focus their attention to areas where sufficient data exists to drive
inferential decisions. We then conclude with a brief discussion of how this
definition of reliability can be used in the design of small area studies.

the predictions under data augmentation and network ensembles. Built on this,
we further propose a unified approach, Mixup Augmentation and Progressive
Selection (MAPS), to fully exploit the noisy pseudo labels of unlabeled target
data during training. On the one hand, MAPS regularizes the model to favor
simple linear behavior in-between the target samples via self-mixup
augmentation, preventing the model from over-fitting to noisy predictions. On
the other hand, MAPS employs the self-paced learning paradigm and progressively
selects pseudo-labeled samples from `easy' to `hard' into the training process
to reduce noise accumulation. Results on four keypoint detection datasets show
that MAPS outperforms the baseline and achieves comparable or even better

(JWST) includes a novel micro shutter array (MSA) to perform multi object
spectroscopy. While the MSA is mainly targeting galaxies across a larger field,
it can also be used for studying star formation in crowded fields. Crowded star
formation regions typically feature strong nebular emission, both in emission
lines and continuum. In this work, nebular emission is referred to as nebular
contamination. Nebular contamination can obscure the light from the stars,
making it more challenging to obtain high quality spectra. The amount of the
nebular contamination mainly depends on the brightness distribution of the
observed `scene'. Here we focus on 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud,
which is part of the NIRSpec GTO program. Using spectrophotometry of 30 Doradus
from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Very Large Telescope
(VLT)/SINFONI, we have created a 3D model of the nebular emission of 30
Doradus. Feeding the NIRSpec Instrument Performance Simulator (IPS) with this
model allows us to quantify the impact of nebular emission on target stellar
spectra as a function of various parameters, such as configuration of the MSA,
angle on the sky, filter band, etc. The results from these simulations show
that the subtraction of nebular contamination from the emission lines of
pre-main sequence stars produces a typical error of $0.8\%$, with a $1\sigma$
spread of $13\%$. The results from our simulations will eventually be compared
to data obtained in space, and will be important to optimize future NIRSpec
observations of massive star forming regions. The results will also be useful
to apply the best calibration strategy and to quantify calibration
uncertainties due to nebular contamination.

constant as a function of $m_{\rm{T}}$ , and far from both the Gaussian case of
$\alpha = 2$ or the conjectured value at the critical endpoint, $\alpha = 0.5$.
The radius scale parameter $R$ shows a slight decrease in $m_{\rm{T}}$, which
can be explained as a signature of transverse flow. Finally, an approximately
constant trend of the intercept parameter $\lambda$ as a function of
$m_{\rm{T}}$ was observed, different from measurement results at RHIC.

prey-predator interaction model that includes the following: (i) fear effect
incorporated in prey birth rate; (ii) group defence of prey against predators;
and (iii) prey refuge. We provide comprehensive mathematical analysis of
extinction and persistence scenarios for both prey and predator species. To
better explore the dynamics of the system, a thorough investigation of
bifurcation analysis has been performed using fear level, prey birth rate, and
prey death rate caused by intra-prey competition as bifurcation parameter. All
potential occurrences of bi-stability dynamics have also been investigated for
some relevant sets of parametric values. Our numerical evaluations show that
high levels of fear can stabilize the prey-predator system by ruling out the
possibility of periodic solutions. Also, our model Hopf bifurcation is
subcritical in contrast to traditional prey-predator models, which ignore the
cost of fear and have supercritical Hopf bifurcations in general. In contrast
to the general trend, predator species go extinct at higher values of prey
birth rates. We have also found that, contrary to the typical tendency for prey
species to go extinct, both prey and predator populations may coexist in the
system as intra-prey competition level grows noticeably. The stability and
Turing instability of associated spatial model have also been investigated
analytically. We also perform the numerical simulation to observe the effect of
different parameters on the density distribution of species. Different types of
spatiotemporal patterns like spot, mixture of spots and stripes have been
observed via variation of time evolution, diffusion coefficient of predator
population, level of fear factor and prey refuge. The fear level parameter (k)
has a great impact on the spatial dynamics of model system.

eclipsing binary systems facilitates the derivation of precise values for the
parameters of the component stars and their orbits, thereby providing stringent
tests of theories of stellar structure and evolution. In this paper two
eccentric eclipsing binary systems, TYC 5378-1590-1 and TYC 8378-252-1, are
studied in detail for the first time. Methods: Radial velocities were obtained
using cross-correlation methods applied to mid-resolution spectra covering
almost the entire orbital phase domains of these two systems. TESS photometry
was used for the analysis of TYC 5378-1590-1, whereas ASAS-SN photometry was
used for the analysis of TYC 8378-252-1. Results: We obtained the first precise
derivation of the physical parameters of these systems. Both systems display
moderately eccentric orbits (e = 0.3 and 0.2) with periods of 3.7323 and 2.8776
days, respectively. The apsidal motion is very slow, with a duration of several
centuries. We present two models for the apsidal motion of TYC 5378-1590-1. The
internal structure constant derived from observations for TYC 8378-252-1 is
approximately 11% lower than theoretical predictions. We discuss possible
reasons for this discrepancy. Our analysis indicates that the components of
both systems are on the main sequence. The components of TYC 5378-1590-1 are
relatively young stars (age 600 Myr) close to the ZAMS, whereas the components
of TYC 8378-252-1 are relatively old stars (age 4 Gyr) close to the TAMS. Our
finding that the circularization timescale for TYC 5378-1590-1 is 200 times
longer than its evolutionary age is compatible with theory; however, our the
evolutionary age of TYC 8378-252-1 is approximately ten times longer than the
circulation age, while its orbital eccentricity is quite high (e= 0.2),
challenges the present theories of circularization.

visualize population structure and admixture between populations. PCA is often

Our method uses the chosen top principal components to predict the genotypes.
By assessing the covariance (and the correlation) of the residuals (the
differences between observed and predicted genotypes), we are able to detect
violation of the model assumptions. Based on simulations and genome wide human
data we show that our assessment of fit can be used to guide the interpretation
of the data and to pinpoint individuals that are not well represented by the

learning is mining repeating patterns in the data, known as structural motifs.
Finding these patterns reduces the exponential search space and therefore
guides the learning of formulas. Despite the importance of motif learning, it
is still not well understood. We present the first principled approach for
mining structural motifs in lifted graphical models, languages that blend
first-order logic with probabilistic models, which uses a stochastic process to
measure the similarity of entities in the data. Our first contribution is an
algorithm, which depends on two intuitive hyperparameters: one controlling the
uncertainty in the entity similarity measure, and one controlling the softness
of the resulting rules. Our second contribution is a preprocessing step where
we perform hierarchical clustering on the data to reduce the search space to
the most relevant data. Our third contribution is to introduce an O(n ln n) (in
the size of the entities in the data) algorithm for clustering
structurally-related data. We evaluate our approach using standard benchmarks

and re-identification (re-id) with only person bounding-box annotations.
Recently, the idea of contrastive learning is initially applied to weakly
supervised person search, where two common contrast strategies are memory-based
contrast and intra-image contrast. We argue that current intra-image contrast
is shallow, which suffers from spatial-level and occlusion-level variance. In
this paper, we present a novel deep intra-image contrastive learning using a
Siamese network. Two key modules are spatial-invariant contrast (SIC) and
occlusion-invariant contrast (OIC). SIC performs many-to-one contrasts between
two branches of Siamese network and dense prediction contrasts in one branch of
Siamese network. With these many-to-one and dense contrasts, SIC tends to learn
discriminative scale-invariant and location-invariant features to solve
spatial-level variance. OIC enhances feature consistency with the masking
strategy to learn occlusion-invariant features. Extensive experiments are
performed on two person search datasets CUHK-SYSU and PRW, respectively. Our
method achieves a state-of-the-art performance among weakly supervised one-step
person search approaches. We hope that our simple intra-image contrastive
learning can provide more paradigms on weakly supervised person search. The

Mott insulator in the one-band Hubbard model. Our results produce several
subtle features in the electron spectra and confirm the key role of
antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations on the appearance of the pseudogap. Upon
hole doping, the electron spectra exhibit a single peak near the Fermi energy
in the absence of AFM correlations. When AFM correlations are included, a
second peak emerges at slightly lower energy and pushes the other peak to
higher energy, so that a pseudogap emerges between the two peaks at small
doping. Both peaks grow rapidly with increasing doping and eventually merge
together, where the pseudogap no longer exists. Detailed analyses of the
spectral evolution with doping and AFM correlations as well as its momentum
dependence confirm that the lower-energy peak comes from a polaronic mechanism
due to the holon-spinon interaction in the AFM correlated background and the
higher-energy peak arises from the holon hybridization to form the electron
quasiparticles. Thus, the pseudogap arises from the interplay of the polaronic
and hybridization mechanisms. Our results are in good agreement with previous
numerical calculations using the dynamical mean-field theory and its cluster
extensions, but give a clearer picture of the underlying physics. Our work
provides a promising perspective for clarifying the nature of doped Mott
insulators and may serve as a starting point for more elaborate investigations

via aligning the hidden representations of nodes and their neighbourhood. Our
first idea achieves such node-to-neighbourhood alignment by directly maximizing

Considering the excessive memory overheads of contrastive learning, we further
propose a negative-free solution, where the main contribution is a Graph Signal

over-smoothing. The GSD constraint unifies some of the existing constraints and
can be used to derive new implementations to combat representation collapse. By

protoplanetary disks to determine their physical properties is known to be
highly degenerate. Hence, a Bayesian analysis is required to obtain parameter
uncertainties and degeneracies. The challenge here is computational speed, as
one radiative transfer model requires a couple of minutes to compute. We
performed a Bayesian analysis for 30 well-known protoplanetary disks to
determine their physical disk properties, including uncertainties and
degeneracies. To circumvent the computational cost problem, we created neural
networks (NNs) to emulate the SED generation process. We created two sets of
radiative transfer disk models to train and test two NNs that predict SEDs for
continuous and discontinuous disks. A Bayesian analysis was then performed on
30 protoplanetary disks with SED data collected by the DIANA project to
determine the posterior distributions of all parameters. We ran this analysis
twice, (i) with old distances and additional parameter constraints as used in a
previous study, to compare results, and (ii) with updated distances and free
choice of parameters to obtain homogeneous and unbiased model parameters. We
evaluated the uncertainties in the determination of physical disk parameters
from SED analysis, and detected and quantified the strongest degeneracies. The
NNs are able to predict SEDs within 1ms with uncertainties of about 5% compared
to the true SEDs obtained by the radiative transfer code. We find parameter
values and uncertainties that are significantly different from previous values
obtained by $\chi^2$ fitting. Comparing the global evidence for continuous and
discontinuous disks, we find that 26 out of 30 objects are better described by
disks that have two distinct radial zones. Also, we created an interactive tool
that instantly returns the SED predicted by our NNs for any parameter
combination.

  turbulence","39 pages, 22 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Flow patterns of causal significance to three-dimensional isotropic
turbulence are identified through the recently introduced algorithm of
Jim\'enez (2018). Localised perturbations are introduced at arbitrary regions
of a triple-periodic decaying flow at ${Re}_\lambda \approx 190$, and their
evolution is used as a marker of the significance of said regions to the flow.
Their dimensions are found to be an important parameter, with sizes of the
order of the integral scale being controlled by the kinetic energy content, and
sizes within the dissipative range, by the enstrophy and dissipation. The three
quantities are found to be important at intermediate (inertial) scales.
Prominent differences emerge between regions of high and low significance. The
former typically contain strong gradients and/or kinetic energy and the latter
are weak. An analysis of the structure of significant and insignificant flow
patterns reveals that strain is more efficient than vorticity at propagating
the contents of the perturbation to other regions of the flow. Moreover, the
flow patterns of significant regions are found to be more complex, typically
containing vortex clusters, while simpler vortex sheets are found in
insignificant regions. The present results suggest that strategies aiming to
manipulate the flow should focus on strain-dominated vortex clusters, avoiding
enstrophy-dominated vortex sheets. This is confirmed through an assimilation
experiment, in which greater synchronisation between two simulations is
achieved when simulations share significant regions rather than insignificant
ones. These conclusions have implications for both the control of turbulent
flows and the making of predictions based on limited or noisy measurements.

modeled by Newton's law but with very small particle inertia as $N$ tends to
infinity and $R$ to $0$. In a mean-field scaling, we show that the particle
evolution is well approximated by the transport-Stokes system which has been

The proof is based on a relative energy argument that exploits the coercivity
of the particle forces with respect to the particle velocities in a Stokes

limits to $2$-Wasserstein distances. Moreover, in order to control the minimal
distance between particles, we prove a representation of the particle forces.
This representation makes the heuristic \enquote{Stokes law} rigorous that the

spontaneous CP violation electroweak baryogenesis via two different patterns of
phase transitions (PTs): (i) two-step PTs whose first-step and second-step are
strongly first-order; (ii) three-step PTs whose first-step is second-order and
the second-step and third-step are strongly first-order. For the case of the
two-step pattern, the first-step PT takes place at a high temperature,
converting the origin phase into an electroweak symmetry broken phase and
breaking the CP symmetry spontaneously. Thus, the baryon number is produced
during the first-step PT. At the second-step PT, the phase is converted into
the observed vacuum at zero temperature, and the CP-symmetry is restored. In
both phases the sphaleron processes are sufficiently suppressed, which keep the
baryon number unchanged. For the case of the three-step PTs, the pseudoscalar
field firstly acquires a nonzero VEV, and VEVs of other fields still remain
zero during the first-step PT. The following PTs and electroweak baryogenesis
are similar to the case of the two-step PTs. In addition, the gravitational
wave spectra can have one or two peaks through the two-step and the three-step
PTs, and we discuss the detectability at the future gravitational wave
detectors.

the greater influence of the host star and of the tidal torque it exerts on the

innermost exoplanets for which the needed parameters are known today, and
determine the conditions of these moons' long-term survival. General lower and
upper bounds on the exomoon survival niches are derived for orbital

secular orbital evolution are applied to a large sample of known exoplanet
systems with their estimated physical parameters. We show that in some
plausible scenarios, exomoons can prevent close exoplanets from spiraling into

stochasticity plays a critical role in car following (CF) dynamics. To
reproduce the observations, quite a few stochastic CF models have been
proposed. However, while calibrating the deterministic CF models is well
investigated, studies on how to calibrate the stochastic models are lacking.
Motivated by this fact, this paper aims to address this fundamental research
gap. Firstly, the CF experiment under the same driving environment is conducted
and analyzed. Based on the experimental results, we test two previous
calibration methods, i.e., the method to minimize the Multiple Runs Mean
(MRMean) error and the method of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
Deficiencies of the two methods have been identified. Next, we propose a new
method to minimize the Multiple Runs Minimum (MRMin) error. Calibration based
on the experimental data and the synthetic data demonstrates that the new
method outperforms the two previous methods. Furthermore, the mechanisms of
different methods are explored from the perspective of error analysis. The
analysis indicates that the new method can be regarded as a nested optimization
model. The method separates the aleatoric errors caused by stochasticity from
the epistemic error caused by parameters, and it is able to deal with the two
kinds of errors effectively. Finally, we find that under the calibration
framework of stochastic CF models, the calibrated parameter set using spacing
as MoP may not always outperform that using velocity as MoP. These findings are
expected to enhance the understanding of the role of stochasticity in CF
dynamics where the new calibration framework for stochastic CF models is
established.

strong lensing images, the subtraction of lens light, and the reconstruction of
lensed images. Based on these analyses, we can reliably evaluate how accurate
the lens mass and source light distributions can be measured. We notice that,
based on lensed images alone, only the Einstein radii ($R_{\rm E}$) or the mean
convergence within them can be well determined, with negligible bias (typically
$<1\%$) and controllable uncertainty. Away from the Einstein radii, the radial
and mean convergence profiles can hardly be constrained unless well-designed
priors are applied to the BPL model. We find that, with rigid priors, the BPL
model can clearly outperform the singular power-law models by recovering the
lens mass distributions with small biases out to several Einstein radii (e.g.,
no more than $5\%$ biases for the mean convergence profiles within $3~R_{\rm
E}$). We find that the source light reconstructions are sensitive to both lens
light contamination and lens mass models, where the BPL model with rigid priors
still performs best when there is no lens light contamination. It is shown
that, by correcting for the projection effect, the BPL model is capable of
estimating the aperture and luminosity weighted line-of-sight velocity
dispersions to an accuracy of $\sim6\%$. These results further highlight the
great potential of the BPL model in strong lensing related studies.

allocation model for the proposed smart soft-RAN model where the
software-defined network (SDN) controller is the first and foremost layer of
the framework. This unit dynamically monitors the network to select a network
operation type on the basis of distributed or centralized resource allocation
procedures to intelligently perform decision-making. In this paper, our aim is
to make the network more scalable and more flexible in terms of conflicting
performance indicators such as achievable data rate, overhead, and complexity
indicators. To this end, we introduce a new metric, i.e.,
throughput-overhead-complexity (TOC), for the proposed machine learning-based
algorithm, which supports a trade-off between these performance indicators. In
particular, the decision making based on TOC is solved via deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) which determines an appropriate resource allocation policy.
  Furthermore, for the selected algorithm, we employ the soft actor-critic
(SAC) method which is more accurate, scalable, and robust than other learning
methods. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed smart network
achieves better performance in terms of TOC compared to fixed centralized or
distributed resource management schemes that lack dynamism. Moreover, our
proposed algorithm outperforms conventional learning methods employed in recent
state-of-the-art network designs.

passing through photometric maximum 53 days later. We describe our ~daily
monitoring of its evolution, covering the first 660 days since discovery. In
all we obtained 574 highly accurate photometric runs simultaneously in the BVRI
bands, and 110 Echelle high-resolution spectra.
  The multi-band photometric evolution of Nova Cas 2021 has been mapped in
detail, and the strict similarities to the proto-type very-slow novae HR Del
and V723 Cas are discussed. All three novae displayed multiple and
short-lasting maxima while for months lingering around a bright plateau,
leading eventually into the final decline and the nebular phase. The decline
for all the novae proceeded at the same pace Flux(V)=(t-to)**alpha with
alpha=-2.3
  Prior to the primary maximum, the emission lines of Nova Cas 2021 were
characterized by a slim Voigt profile, and after it all lines became much wider
and characterized by a broad central component superimposed on a ever broader
pedestal. This transition happened at the same time gamma-ray emission was
detected for a few days. Along the 7-month plateau, the line profile displayed
a reckless variability at all velocity scales in response to the ever changing
brightness of the nova during the secondary maxima. Upon leaving the plateau on
day +230, nebular lines appeared and the ionization degree quickly increased,
passing from FeII/Balmer/HeI through HeII/Bowen and then to
[CaV]/[NeV]/[FeVII]. After about day +550, the profiles stopped evolving,
freezing their aspect. At later epochs, the profiles of all emission lines
turned densely castellated, with all dents stable in radial velocity at 1 km/s
over the last four months.

sense-plan-act, RL, IL), visual observations (point cloud, RGBD), and
controllers (e.g., action type and parameterization). Moreover, it empowers
fast visual input learning algorithms so that a CNN-based policy can collect
samples at about 2000 FPS with 1 GPU and 16 processes on a regular workstation.
It implements a render server infrastructure to allow sharing rendering

which completely suppresses the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) order on the

AFM order successfully establishes and constitutes the conventional competition
between the RKKY and Kondo couplings. The geometrical frustration on the
triangular lattice is partially released when doped with holes, in which two
different magnetic orders emerge unexpectedly. The two orders closely relate to
the topology of the interacting Fermi surface. Our comprehensive comparison of
the KLM on the two lattices not only reveals a significant competition of

also sheds light on experimentally finding new phases in related materials.

light-shining-through-a-wall experiments. By adding more than one additional
Higgs doublet, these non-minimal DFSZ models extend the viable axion parameter
space and lead to a large range of axion-photon couplings. We find couplings
almost three orders of magnitude larger than the ones of the minimal models.
Most of the possible axion-photon couplings, however, lie in the vicinity of
the values dictated by the minimal models. We quantify this by introducing a
theoretical prior probability distribution for DFSZ-type axions and giving
$68\%$ and $95\%$ lower bounds as well as two-sided bands. We compare our
results for the DFSZ axion-photon coupling distributions with the KSVZ case,
for which a similar analysis has been conducted. Both display similar values as
well as a very specific pattern. In order to identify preferred models, we
discuss the role of flavour changing neutral currents and the domain wall
problem as possible selection criteria. It is possible to construct a large
number of non-minimal DFSZ models with a domain wall number of unity and
thereby avoiding the domain wall problem. This subset also has a significantly
enhanced axion-photon coupling compared to the minimal DFSZ models.

example, a ladder-like boron hydride sheet, named as 2D ladder polyborane,
achieves the desired outcome, enjoying the cleanest scenario with an
anisotropic and tilted Dirac cone, that can be fully depicted by a minimal
two-band tight-binding model. Introducing external fields, such as an electric
field or a circularly-polarized light field can effectively induce distinctive
massive Dirac fermions, whereupon four types of multi-field-driven topological
domain walls hosting tunable chirality and valley indexes are further
established. Moreover, the 2D ladder polyborane is thermodynamically stable at
room temperature and supports highly switchable Dirac fermions, providing an
ideal platform for realizing and exploring the various multi-field-tunable
electronic states.

the existing methods are still limited by the fact that GNNs are essentially
difficult to handle the connections between long-distance nodes in a code

2) enhanced graph representation learning, which involves one edge-aware graph
convolutional network module for fusing heterogeneous edge information into
node representations and one kernel-scaled representation module for well
capturing the relations between distant graph nodes. Experiments on three

Most SCL methods commonly adopt a loss-based strategy of estimating data

While achieving success in a variety of applications, SCL stills confront two
challenges in a medical image analysis task, such as universal lesion
detection, featuring insufficient and highly class-imbalanced data: (i) the

under-utilized from a deweighting mechanism. To overcome these challenges, in
this paper we propose a novel mixed-order self-paced curriculum learning

improving user experience through better recommendations, and even prevent

mixture of Markov chains. Recently, Gupta, Kumar and Vassilvitski [GKV16]
introduced an algorithm (GKV-SVD) based on the singular value decomposition
(SVD) that under certain conditions can perfectly recover a mixture of L chains
on n states, given only the distribution of trails of length 3 (3-trail).
  In this work we contribute to the problem of unmixing Markov chains by
highlighting and addressing two important constraints of the GKV-SVD algorithm
[GKV16]: some chains in the mixture may not even be weakly connected, and
secondly in practice one does not know beforehand the true number of chains. We
resolve these issues in the Gupta et al. paper [GKV16]. Specifically, we
propose an algebraic criterion that enables us to choose a value of L
efficiently that avoids overfitting. Furthermore, we design a reconstruction
algorithm that outputs the true mixture in the presence of disconnected chains
and is robust to noise. We complement our theoretical results with experiments
on both synthetic and real data, where we observe that our method outperforms
the GKV-SVD algorithm. Finally, we empirically observe that combining an
EM-algorithm with our method performs best in practice, both in terms of
reconstruction error with respect to the distribution of 3-trails and the
mixture of Markov Chains.

based on the Landau-Lifshitz formulation of the theory, the field equations of
the scale-independent EMSG are solved approximately. The gravitational
potential in the wave zone of a gravitational source is then obtained. Doing
so, we derive the GW signals emitted from a binary system. The results are
different from those obtained in general relativity (GR). It is shown that the
relevant non-GR corrections modify the wave amplitude and leave the GW
polarizations unchanged. In this case, the system loses energy to modified GWs.
This leads to a change in the secular variation of the Keplerian parameters of
the binary system. In this work, we investigate the non-GR effects on the
radiative parameter, i.e., the first time derivative of the orbital period.
Next, applying these results together with GW observations from the

force. In this technique, the main physical quantities/parameters involved are:
temporal width and energy of light pulses, thermal heating and cooling time,
friction force and elastic waves. Despite a few experimental observations based
on micro-fiber systems, a microscopic theory, which reveals how these
quantities collaboratively enable motion of the micro-objects and derives what
the underlying manipulation principles emerge, is absent. In this article, a
comprehensive theoretical analysis--centralized around the above listed
physical quantities, and illuminated by a single-friction-point model in
conjunction with numerical simulations--is established to pedagogically clarify
the physics. Our results reveal the two essential factors in this technique:
(1) the use of short light pulses for rapid thermal expansion overwhelming
friction resistance and (2) the timescale asymmetry in thermal heating and
cooling for accumulating a net sliding distance. Moreover, we examine the
effects of spatially distributed friction beyond the single-friction-point
consideration, and show ""tug-of-war""-like friction stretching in the driving
process. Given these insights, we positively predict that this
elastic-wave-based manipulation principle could be directly translated to
micro/nano-scale optical waveguides on optical chips, and propose a practical

we perform a statistical analysis of the prominence at a cadence of $\sim

structure formation predominantly in the vertical velocity $V_y$ component,
consistent with observations, demonstrating an anisotropic turbulence state

velocity, magnetic, and temperature fields. The presence of intermittency is
evident from the probability density functions of the field fluctuations, which
depart from Gaussianity as we consider smaller and smaller scales. In exact
agreement, the higher-order structure functions quantify the multifractality,

understand our results quantitatively, and test whether the sweep-up outcome is
sensitive to disk parameters and details of the grain coagulation model. The
sweep-up pebble population could be important for planet formation, because
they are less well-coupled to the gas (compared to the main population below
the fragmentation barrier) and therefore more favorable to known mechanisms of
dust clump formation (which initiate planetesimal formation). It also contains
enough mass to form all planet cores, based on observational estimates of the
planet mass budget. Our findings motivate future studies of grain growth and
planetesimal formation in Class 0/I disks, including the subsequent evolution
of this sweep-up population.

multiplicity adjustment as a consequence of common controls is currently a
controversial debate among researchers, pharmaceutical companies, as well as

trials on the type one error and power in comparison to what would have been
obtained with a platform trial with individual control arms in a simulation

adjustment is required in a platform trial. In both study designs, the
family-wise error rate (FWER) is inflated compared to a standard, two-armed
randomized controlled trial when no multiplicity adjustment is applied. In case
of a common control, the FWER inflation is smaller. In most circumstances, a
platform trial with a common control is still beneficial in terms of sample

platform trial with a common control loses the efficiency gain. Therefore, we
further discuss the need for adjustment in terms of a family definition or

inherent within the regressors. Using a Bayesian approach, we model the mean
vector by a one-group global-local shrinkage prior belonging to a broad class
of such priors that includes the horseshoe prior. In the context of variable
selection, this class of priors was studied by Tang et al. (2018)
\cite{tang2018bayesian}. A modified form of the usual class of global-local
shrinkage priors with polynomial tail on the group regression coefficients is
proposed. The resulting threshold rule selects the active group if within a
group, the ratio of the $L_2$ norm of the posterior mean of its group
coefficient to that of the corresponding ordinary least square group estimate
is greater than a half. In the theoretical part of this article, we have used
the global shrinkage parameter either as a tuning one or an empirical Bayes
estimate of it depending on the knowledge regarding the underlying sparsity of
the model. When the proportion of active groups is known, using $\tau$ as a
tuning parameter, we have proved that our method enjoys variable selection
consistency. In case this proportion is unknown, we propose an empirical Bayes
estimate of $\tau$. Even if this empirical Bayes estimate is used, then also
our half-thresholding rule captures the true sparse group structure. Though our
theoretical works rely on a special form of the design matrix, but for general
design matrices also, our simulation results show that the half-thresholding
rule yields results similar to that of Yang and Narisetty (2020)
\cite{yang2020consistent}. As a consequence of this, in a high dimensional
sparse group selection problem, instead of using the so-called `gold standard'
spike and slab prior, one can use the one-group global-local shrinkage priors
with polynomial tail to obtain similar results.

To alleviate this problem, this paper introduces a multi-feature embedding

trained on dialogue sequences. MFeEmb leverages textual, structural, and
semantic information from the dialogues by incorporating lexical, dialogue
acts, and sentiment features. The use of dialogue acts and sentiment features
reduces performance loss from natural distribution shifts caused mainly by
changes in vocabulary.
  This paper demonstrates the performance of MFeEmb on domain adaptation

applied to predict team performance in a different domain. The generalizability
of MFeEmb is quantified using the similarity measure proposed by Bontonou et
al. (2021). Our results show that MFeEmb serves as an excellent domain-agnostic
representation for meta-pretraining a few-shot model on collaborative

as an approach for achieving decentralized collective navigation of Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms. The technique is based on the flocking and
collective navigation behavior observed in natural swarms, such as cattle
herds, bird flocks, and even large groups of humans. As global and concurrent
information of all swarm members is not available in natural swarms, these
systems use local observations to achieve the desired behavior. Similarly,
PACNav relies only on local observations of relative positions of UAVs, making
it suitable for large swarms deprived of communication capabilities and
external localization systems. We introduce the novel concepts of path
persistence and path similarity that allow each swarm member to analyze the
motion of other members in order to determine its own future motion. PACNav is
based on two main principles: (1) UAVs with little variation in motion
direction have high path persistence, and are considered by other UAVs to be
reliable leaders; (2) groups of UAVs that move in a similar direction have high
path similarity, and such groups are assumed to contain a reliable leader. The
proposed approach also embeds a reactive collision avoidance mechanism to avoid
collisions with swarm members and environmental obstacles. This collision
avoidance ensures safety while reducing deviations from the assigned path.
Along with several simulated experiments, we present a real-world experiment in
a natural forest, showcasing the validity and effectiveness of the proposed
collective navigation approach in challenging environments. The source code is
released as open-source, making it possible to replicate the obtained results
and facilitate the continuation of research by the community.

a CPU. We then focus on three applications where efficient and differentiable
waveforms are essential. Firstly, we demonstrate how gradient descent can be
used to optimize the $\sim 200$ coefficients that are used to calibrate the

MIS$^*$ is equivalent to the Burgers model for viscoelasticity, and this
implies that the former must exhibit an elastic behavior at high frequencies.

a given class of base graphs if there exists a family of symmetric XOR-circuits
with certain properties. These properties include that the circuits have the
same symmetries as the base graphs, are of polynomial size, and satisfy certain
fan-in restrictions. Then we prove that such circuits with slightly
strengthened requirements (i.e. stronger symmetry and fan-in and fan-out
restrictions) do not exist for the n-dimensional hypercubes as base graphs.
This almost separates the CFI-symmetric algorithms from polynomial time - up to
the gap that remains between the circuits whose existence we can currently
disprove and the circuits whose existence is necessary for the definability of

Eliminator is also constructed and experimented with using a mannequin to model
human vision in a typical passenger vehicle. The results of this experiment
illustrated a substantial improvement in viewing ability, as predicted by
earlier calculations. Therefore, this paper concludes that the proposed Blind

to solve multitudes of computational problems with the promising technology.
Feasibility of solutions for computational problems, and representation of
various information, may allow quantum computing to replace classical computer
in near future. One such challenge is the representation of digital images in
quantum computer. Several works have been done to make it possible. One such
promising technique, named Quantum Probability Image Encoding, requires minimal
number of qubits, where the intensity of n pixels is represented as the
statevector of log_2(n) qubits. Though there exist quantum circuit design
techniques to obtain arbitrary statevector, they consider statevector in
general Hilbert space. But for image data, considering only real vector space
is sufficient, that may constraint the circuit in smaller gate set, and
possibly can reduce number of gates required. In this paper, construction of
such quantum circuits has been proposed.

learning models have also been used to solve visual abstract reasoning tasks,
which are relatively less well-defined, and have been widely used to measure
human intelligence. However, current deep models struggle to match human
abilities to solve such tasks with minimum data but maximum generalization. One
limitation is that current deep learning models work in a monotonic way, i.e.,
treating different parts of the input in essentially fixed orderings, whereas
people repeatedly observe and reason about the different parts of the visual
stimuli until the reasoning process converges to a consistent conclusion, i.e.,
non-monotonic reasoning. This paper proposes a non-monotonic computational
approach to solve visual abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we
implemented a deep learning model using this approach and tested it on the
RAVEN dataset -- a dataset inspired by the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.
Results show that the proposed approach is more effective than existing
monotonic deep learning models, under strict experimental settings that
represent a difficult variant of the RAVEN dataset problem.

begin with the simplest imaginable picture, and then progress, through a series
of nontrivial arguments, to an action that contains the fields of the Standard
Model embedded in a more complete theory, with $SO(10)$ grand unification,
supersymmetry (at some energy scale), and an extended Higgs sector. This last
feature predicts a novel dark matter WIMP with no interactions except
second-order gauge couplings to $W$ and $Z$ bosons. Calculations and estimates
of the relevant cross-sections for this particle demonstrate that (1) it may be
detectable within the next few years in direct-detection experiments (beginning
with LZ and XENONnT), (2) it may be observable within about 15 years at the
high-luminosity LHC, and (3) there is a strong case that it may already have
been detected in the gamma rays observed by Fermi-LAT and antiprotons observed
by AMS-02. In addition to quantitative predictions for this dark matter
particle -- a mass of about 70 GeV/c$^2$, a current annihilation cross-section

some other fundamental issues. These include the absence of an enormous
cosmological constant, the thermodynamics of physical black holes, the
regularization of quantum gravity near the Planck scale, a mechanism for
supersymmetry breaking, the origin of gravitational and gauge interactions, the
origin of Lorentz invariance, the origin of spacetime coordinates, the origin

The Mallat Scattering Transformation (MST) is taken of the logarithm of both

of both fields. The fields are projected onto the PCA vectors and a small
number of these PCA vector components are kept. Singular Value Decompositions
of the cross correlation of the input parameters to the output logarithm of the
MST of the fields, and of the cross correlation of the SVD vector components to
the PCA vector components are done. This allows the identification of the PCA

issues. Therefore, simulating human activities to produce massive high-quality

existing solutions, including rule-based methods with simplified assumptions of
human behavior and data-driven methods directly fitting real-world data, both
cannot fully qualify for matching reality. In this paper, motivated by the
classic psychological theory, Maslow's need theory describing human motivation,
we propose a knowledge-driven simulation framework based on generative
adversarial imitation learning. To enhance the fidelity and utility of the
generated activity data, our core idea is to model the evolution of human needs
as the underlying mechanism that drives activity generation in the simulation
model. Specifically, this is achieved by a hierarchical model structure that
disentangles different need levels, and the use of neural stochastic
differential equations that successfully captures piecewise-continuous
characteristics of need dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of data fidelity

characterization and analysis are needed to form a fundamental understating of
the fuel performance, and make U-10Zr fuel qualify for commercial use. The
movement of lanthanides across the fuel section from the hot fuel center to the
cool cladding surface is one of the key factors to affect fuel performance. In
the advanced annular U-10Zr fuel, the lanthanides present as fission gas
bubbles. Due to a lack of annotated data, existing literature utilized a
multiple-threshold method to separate the bubbles and calculate bubble
statistics on an annular fuel. However, the multiple-threshold method cannot
achieve robust performance on images with different qualities and contrasts,
and cannot distinguish different bubbles. This paper proposes a hybrid
framework for efficient bubble segmentation. We develop a bubble annotation
tool and generate the first fission gas bubble dataset with more than 3000
bubbles from 24 images. A multi-task deep learning network integrating U-Net
and ResNet is designed to accomplish instance-level bubble segmentation.
Combining the segmentation results and image processing step achieves the best
recall ratio of more than 90% with very limited annotated data. Our model shows
outstanding improvement by comparing the previously proposed thresholding
method. The proposed method has promising to generate a more accurate
quantitative analysis of fission gas bubbles on U-10Zr annular fuels. The
results will contribute to identifying the bubbles with lanthanides and finally
build the relationship between the thermal gradation and lanthanides movements
of U-10Zr annular fuels. Mover, the deep learning model is applicable to other

of the non-surface-treated wire could be optimized by means of thermal
treatment within certain limits, but the corrosion rate remained very high.
Hence, strength and ductility of these wires vanished after 24 h of immersion
in simulated body fluid at 37$^\circ$C and, as a result of that rather quick
degradation, direct tests did not show any MC3T3-E1 preosteoblast cell
attachment on the surface of the Mg wires. In contrast, surface modification of
the annealed WE43 Mg wires by a continuous PEO process led to the formation of
a homogeneous oxide layer of $\approx$ 8$\mu$m and significantly improved the
corrosion resistance and hence the biocompatibility of the WE43 Mg wires. It
was found that a dense layer of Ca/P was formed at the early stages of
degradation on top of the Mg(OH)2 layer and hindered the diffusion of the
Cl-ions which dissolve Mg(OH)2 and accelerate the corrosion of Mg alloys. As a
result, pitting corrosion was suppressed and the strength of the Mg wires was
above 100 MPa after 96 h of immersion in simulated body fluid at 37$^\circ$C.
Moreover, many cells were able to attach on the surface of the PEO
surface-modified wires during cell culture testing. These results demonstrate
the potential of thin Mg wires surface-modified by continuous PEO in terms of
mechanical, degradation and biological performance for bioabsorbable wire-based

Ahsan Habib","A Secure Land Record Management System using Blockchain Technology","6 pages, 5 tables, 10 figures, ICCIT 2022",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  A land record (LR) contains very sensitive information related to land e.g.
owner, buyer, etc. Currently, almost all over the world, the LR is maintained
by different governmental offices and most of them maintain the LR with
paper-based approach. Some of the works focus to digitalize the existing land
record management system (LRMS) but with some security concerns. A
blockchain-based LRMS can be effective enough to solve the existing issues.
This paper proposes a blockchain-based LRMS that (i) digitalizes the existing
paper-based system, (ii) ensures LR privacy using an asymmetric cryptosystem,
(iii) preserves LR integrity, (iv) facilitates a platform for trading land
through an advertising agency, and (v) accelerates the process of changing
ownership that saves time significantly. Besides, this paper also proposes a
new way of character to integer mapping named C2I table that reduces around 33%
overhead of text to integer conversion compared to ASCII table. The
experimental results, analyses, and comparisons indicate the effectiveness of
the proposed LRMS over the state-of-the-art systems.

  cultural innovation in agent-based model","9 pages, 5 figures, AAMAS 2023 (accepted)",,,,"cs.MA q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Previous investigations into creative and innovation networks have suggested
that innovations often occurs at the boundary between the network's core and
periphery. In this work, we investigate the effect of global core-periphery
network structure on the speed and quality of cultural innovation. Drawing on
differing notions of core-periphery structure from [arXiv:1808.07801] and
[doi:10.1016/S0378-8733(99)00019-2], we distinguish decentralized
core-periphery, centralized core-periphery, and affinity network structure. We
generate networks of these three classes from stochastic block models (SBMs),
and use them to run an agent-based model (ABM) of collective cultural
innovation, in which agents can only directly interact with their network
neighbors. In order to discover the highest-scoring innovation, agents must
discover and combine the highest innovations from two completely parallel
technology trees. We find that decentralized core-periphery networks outperform
the others by finding the final crossover innovation more quickly on average.
We hypothesize that decentralized core-periphery network structure accelerates
collective problem-solving by shielding peripheral nodes from the local optima
known by the core community at any given time. We then build upon the ""Two
Truths"" hypothesis regarding community structure in spectral graph embeddings,
first articulated in [arXiv:1808.07801], which suggests that the adjacency
spectral embedding (ASE) captures core-periphery structure, while the Laplacian
spectral embedding (LSE) captures affinity. We find that, for core-periphery
networks, ASE-based resampling best recreates networks with similar performance
on the innovation SBM, compared to LSE-based resampling. Since the Two Truths
hypothesis suggests that ASE captures core-periphery structure, this result
further supports our hypothesis.

  for Community Detection",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community is a fundamental and critical characteristic of a Large-scale
Undirected Network (LUN) like a social network, making community detection a
vital yet thorny issue in LUN representation learning. Owing to its good
scalability and interpretability, a Symmetric and Nonnegative Matrix
Factorization (SNMF) model is commonly used to tackle this issue. However, it
adopts a unique Latent Factor (LF) matrix for precisely representing an LUN's
symmetry, which leads to a reduced LF space that impairs its representational
learning ability. Motivated by this discovery, this study proposes a Symmetry
and Graph-regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (SGNMF) method that
adopts three-fold ideas: a) leveraging multiple LF matrices to represent an
LUN, thereby enhancing its representation learning ability; b) introducing a
symmetry regularization term that implies the equality constraint between its
multiple LF matrices, thereby illustrating an LUN's symmetry; and c)
incorporating graph regularization into its learning objective, thereby
illustrating an LUN's intrinsic geometry. A theoretical proof is provided to
ensure SGNMF's convergence on an LUN. Extensive experiment results on ten LUNs
from real applications demonstrate that our proposed SGNMF-based community
detector significantly outperforms several baseline and state-of-the-art models
in achieving highly-accurate results for community detection.

photon manipulation by combining key components on integrated chips which are
operated by external driving electronics. Nevertheless, electrical
interconnects between driving electronics and the electro-optic components,
some of which require cryogenic operating conditions, can introduce parasitic
effects. Here we show an all-optical interface which simultaneously delivers
the operation power to, and extracts the measurement signal from, an advanced
photonic circuit, namely, bias and readout of a superconducting nanowire single
photon detector (SNSPD) on a single stage in a 1K cryostat. To do so, we supply
all power for the single photon detector, output signal conditioning, and
electro-optic readout using optical interconnects alone, thereby fully
decoupling the cryogenic circuitry from the external environment. This removes
the need to heatsink electrical connections, and potentially offers low-loss,
high-bandwidth signal processing. This method opens the possibility to operate
other advanced electrically decoupled photonic circuits such as optical control

extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the
superiority of DASH in terms of (1) accuracy, (2) efficiency, and (3)

stream. The model refers to an integer-valued structural information such as
the number of free parameters in a parametric model. Specifically we are
concerned with the problem of how we can detect signs of model changes earlier
than they are actualized. To this end, we employ {\em continuous model
selection} on the basis of the notion of {\em descriptive
dimensionality}~(Ddim). It is a real-valued model dimensionality, which is
designed for quantifying the model dimensionality in the model transition
period. Continuous model selection is to determine the real-valued model
dimensionality in terms of Ddim from a given data. We propose a novel
methodology for detecting signs of model changes by tracking the rise-up of
Ddim in a data stream. We apply this methodology to detecting signs of changes
of the number of clusters in a Gaussian mixture model and those of the order in
an auto regression model. With synthetic and real data sets, we empirically
demonstrate its effectiveness by showing that it is able to visualize well how
rapidly model dimensionality moves in the transition period and to raise early
warning signals of model changes earlier than they are detected with existing

Therefore, they can contribute to scientific and fact-based media coverage.
Even though press briefings are highly informative, extracting statements

support this task, an automated statement extraction system is proposed. Claims
are used as the main feature to identify statements in press briefing

then claim sentences are identified through sequence classification.
Subsequently, topics are detected, and the sentences are filtered to improve
the coherence and assess the length of the statements.
  The results indicate that claim detection can be used to identify statements
in press briefings. While many statements can be extracted automatically with
this system, they are not always as coherent as needed to be understood without

should not be better off by acting dishonestly. In the context of collective
decision-making, this axiom is known as strategyproofness and turns out to be
rather prohibitive, even when allowing for randomization. In particular,
Gibbard's random dictatorship theorem shows that only rather unattractive
social decision schemes (SDSs) satisfy strategyproofness on the full domain of
preferences. In this paper, we obtain more positive results by investigating
strategyproof SDSs on the Condorcet domain, which consists of all preference
profiles that admit a Condorcet winner. In more detail, we show that, if the
number of voters $n$ is odd, every strategyproof and non-imposing SDS on the
Condorcet domain can be represented as a mixture of dictatorial SDSs and the
Condorcet rule (which chooses the Condorcet winner with probability $1$).
Moreover, we prove that the Condorcet domain is a maximal connected domain that
allows for attractive strategyproof SDSs if $n$ is odd as only random
dictatorships are strategyproof and non-imposing on any sufficiently connected
superset of it. We also derive analogous results for even $n$ by slightly
extending the Condorcet domain. Finally, we also characterize the set of
group-strategyproof and non-imposing SDSs on the Condorcet domain and its
supersets. These characterizations strengthen Gibbard's random dictatorship
theorem and establish that the Condorcet domain is essentially a maximal domain

model for 162P has axis ratios $a/b = 1.56$ and $b/c = 2.33$, sidereal period
$P = 32.864\pm0.001$ h, and a rotation pole oriented towards ecliptic longitude
$\lambda_E = 118^\circ \pm 26^\circ$ and latitude
$\beta_E=-50^\circ\pm21^\circ$. We constrain the possible nucleus elongation to
lie within $1.4 < a/b < 2.0$ and discuss tentative evidence that 162P may have
a bilobed structure. Using the shape model to correct the lightcurves for
rotational effects, we derive a linear phase function with slope
$\beta=0.051\pm0.002$ mag deg$^{-1}$ and intercept $H_r(1,1,0) = 13.86 \pm
0.02$ for 162P. We find no evidence that the nucleus exhibited an opposition
surge at phase angles down to 0.39$^\circ$. The challenges associated with
modelling the shapes of comet nuclei from lightcurves are highlighted, and we
comment on the extent to which we anticipate that LSST will alleviate these
challenges in the coming decade.

define what is good in relation to system architecture, and who should provide

times of power outages during a hurricane. Considering restoration time as the
dependent variable and utilizing a comprehensive set of county-level data, we
have estimated a Generalized Accelerated Failure Time (GAFT) that accounts for
spatial dependence among observations for time to event data. Considering

Using GAFT model and Hurricane Irma as a case study, we examined: (1)
differences in electric power outages and restoration rates among different
types of power companies: investor-owned power companies, rural and municipal

  Time-varying Networks","12 pages,12 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper deals with the distributed state estimation problem under the
jointly observable assumption over time-varying network topologies. The results
are shown to apply when the system to be observed is unstable. They also apply
to situations where the communication networks are disconnected at every
instant. They also apply to the usual connected static networks, or, switching
networks that are connected at every time, as special cases. We present
sufficient conditions for the existence of distributed observers for general
linear systems over periodic communication networks. Using an averaging
approach, it is shown that the proposed distributed observer can provide
exponentially converging state estimates of the state of the linear system when
the network is uniformly connected on average. This average connectedness
condition offers a more relaxed assumption that includes periodic switching,
Markovian switching and switching subject to the Cox process as special cases.
All the nodes in the network share the estimated state with their neighbours
through the network and cooperatively reconstruct the entire state locally.
Furthermore, this study presents two exponential stability results for two
classes of switched systems, providing valuable tools for future research in
related distributed state estimation fields. A toy example and three practical
applications are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical
results.

technologies, the demand for novel logic devices has never been greater. While
spin-based devices present a major opportunity towards favorable scaling,
switching energies are still orders of magnitude above the expected values.
Alternatively, magnetoelectric materials are predicted to enable low-power
control of magnetization, a relatively unexplored pathway with sparse results
at a device level. Here, we demonstrate voltage-based magnetization switching
and reading in nanodevices at room temperature, enabled by exchange coupling
between multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ and ferromagnetic CoFe, for the writing, and
spin-to-charge current conversion between CoFe and Pt, for the reading. Unlike
other current-based spintronic devices, magnetization writing is driven solely
by voltage pulses. We show that, upon electrical switching of the BiFeO$_3$,
the magnetization of the CoFe can be reversed, giving rise to different voltage
outputs. The voltage-induced switching is supported through a combination of
piezoresponse, magnetic force microscopy, and scanning nitrogen-vacancy
magnetometry, where magnetization reversal is linked with the polarization
state and antiferromagnetic cycloid propagation direction in the BiFeO$_3$.
This study constitutes the building block for magnetoelectric spin-orbit logic,
as well as a new avenue for low-power beyond-CMOS technologies.

assurance at compile time. TypeScript and other gradual type systems facilitate
type migration by allowing programmers to start with imprecise types and
gradually strengthen them. However, adding types is a manual effort and several
migrations on large, industry codebases have been reported to have taken
several years. In the research community, there has been significant interest
in using machine learning to automate TypeScript type migration. Existing
machine learning models report a high degree of accuracy in predicting
individual TypeScript type annotations. However, in this paper we argue that
accuracy can be misleading, and we should address a different question: can an
automatic type migration tool produce code that passes the TypeScript type
checker?
  We present TypeWeaver, a TypeScript type migration tool that can be used with
an arbitrary type prediction model. We evaluate TypeWeaver with three models
from the literature: DeepTyper, a recurrent neural network; LambdaNet, a graph
neural network; and InCoder, a general-purpose, multi-language transformer that
supports fill-in-the-middle tasks. Our tool automates several steps that are
necessary for using a type prediction model, (1) importing types for a
project's dependencies; (2) migrating JavaScript modules to TypeScript
notation; (3) inserting predicted type annotations into the program to produce
TypeScript when needed; and (4) rejecting non-type predictions when needed.
  We evaluate TypeWeaver on a dataset of 513 JavaScript packages, including
packages that have never been typed before. With the best type prediction
model, we find that only 21% of packages type check, but more encouragingly,
69% of files type check successfully.

carbon emissions, while simultaneously reducing intermittency of the total
energy production. We find that the regulation of a competitive market is more
efficient than the one of the monopoly as measured with the certainty

achieved thanks to a higher degree of freedom of the incentive mechanisms which
involves cross-subsidies between firms. A numerical study quantifies the impact

intelligent variation operator similar in spirit to evolutionary crossover. In
particular, language models of sufficient scale demonstrate in-context
learning, i.e. they can learn from associations between a small number of input
patterns to generate outputs incorporating such associations (also called
few-shot prompting). This ability can be leveraged to form a simple but
powerful variation operator, i.e. to prompt a language model with a few
text-based genotypes (such as code, plain-text sentences, or equations), and to
parse its corresponding output as those genotypes' offspring. The promise of
such language model crossover (which is simple to implement and can leverage
many different open-source language models) is that it enables a simple
mechanism to evolve semantically-rich text representations (with few
domain-specific tweaks), and naturally benefits from current progress in
language models. Experiments in this paper highlight the versatility of
language-model crossover, through evolving binary bit-strings, sentences,

language model crossover is a promising method for evolving genomes

chest X-rays into discrete visual tokens and formulating both tasks as sequence
generation tasks. Second, we introduce several special tokens to generate chest
X-rays with specific views that can be useful when the desired views are
unavailable. Furthermore, UniXGen can flexibly take various inputs from single
to multiple views to take advantage of the additional findings available in
other X-ray views. We adopt an efficient transformer for computational and
memory efficiency to handle the long-range input sequence of multi-view chest
X-rays with high resolution and long paragraph reports. In extensive
experiments, we show that our unified model has a synergistic effect on both
generation tasks, as opposed to training only the task-specific models. We also
find that view-specific special tokens can distinguish between different views
and properly generate specific views even if they do not exist in the dataset,

user is directly prompting the LLM. But, what if it is not the user prompting?
We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and
instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using Indirect Prompt Injection,
that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit
LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely
to be retrieved. We derive a comprehensive taxonomy from a computer security
perspective to systematically investigate impacts and vulnerabilities,
including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination, and other
novel security risks. We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against
both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion

observation 3 with three unique points: high laser power, power stabilization
system, and remote beam position control. KAGRA employs the 20 W laser and
divides it into two beams injected on the mirror surface. By using a high-power
laser, we can calibrate the response at the kHz region. To control the power of
each laser independently, we also installed an optical follower servo for each
beam power stabilization. By controlling the optical path of the photon
calibrater beam positions with pico-motors, we were able to characterize the
rotation response of the detector. We also installed a telephoto camera and QPD
to monitor beam position and controlled beam position to optimize mirror
response. In this paper, we discussed the statistical error with the result of
the relative power noise measurement. We also discussed systematic errors about
the power calibration model of photon calibrator and simulation of elastic

also concern the type of renormalization condition which is chosen for a

attention. However, non-stationary bandits lack a formal definition. Loosely
speaking, non-stationary bandits have typically been characterized in the
literature as those for which the reward distribution changes over time. We
demonstrate that this informal definition is ambiguous. Further, a widely-used
notion of regret -- the dynamic regret -- is motivated by this ambiguous
definition and thus problematic. In particular, even for an optimal agent,
dynamic regret can suggest poor performance. The ambiguous definition also
motivates a measure of the degree of non-stationarity experienced by a bandit,
which often overestimates and can give rise to extremely loose regret bounds.
The primary contribution of this paper is a formal definition that resolves
ambiguity. This definition motivates a new notion of regret, an alternative
measure of the degree of non-stationarity, and a regret analysis that leads to
tighter bounds for non-stationary bandit learning. The regret analysis applies
to any bandit, stationary or non-stationary, and any agent.

shape, though the counteracting force of the cooling stream caused them to
circularize. Droplet geometry was thus the net result of streaming forces and
surface tension at the acoustic boundary layer/air-liquid interface. Nucleation
was determined to be neither homogeneous nor heterogeneous but secondary, and
thus dependent on the cooling rate and not on the degree of supercooling. It
was likely initiated by aerosolized ice particles from the air or from droplets
that had already nucleated and broken up. The latter secondary ice production
process resulted in multi-drop systems with statistically identical nucleation
times. Notably, this meant that the presence of interfacial rupture at an
adjacent droplet could influence the crystallization behaviour of another.
After the formation of an initial ice shell around the individual droplets,
dendritic protrusions grew from the droplet surface, likely seeded by the same
ice particles that caused nucleation, but at a quasi-liquid layer. When
freezing was complete, it was determined that the frozen core had undergone a
volumetric expansion of 30.75%, compared to 9% for pure, sessile water
expansion. This significantly greater expansion may have resulted from
entrained air bubbles at the inner solid-liquid interface and oscillations at
the moving phase boundary caused by changes in local acoustic forces. Soon
after melting began, acoustic streaming, the buoyancy of the remaining ice, and
convective currents caused by an inner thermal gradient and thermocapillary
effects along the air-liquid interface, all contributed to the droplet spinning
about the horizontal axis.

its expertise, with only a small subset of the candidates and is asked to grade
each of those. Extending the classical theory, we study aggregation methods in
which a voter will not be eligible to grade all the candidates, and the
candidates are not eligible for the same sets of voters. Moreover, each

  We study the infinite-volume limits of the arboreal gas on the hypercubic

uniform spanning forest on this same trace.
  Second, we prove that the uniform spanning forest of any

contingent upon the demand landscape for automated vehicles (AVs). Focusing on
the public acceptance behavior of AVs, this empirical study addresses two gaps
in the plethora of travel behavior research on identifying the potential
determinants thereof. First, a clear behavioral understanding is lacking as to
the perceived concern about AV safety and the consequent effect on AV
acceptance behavior. Second, how people appraise the benefits of enhanced
automated mobility to meet their current (pre-AV era) travel behavior and
needs, along with the resulting impacts on AV acceptance and perceived safety
concern, remain equivocal. To fill these gaps, a recursive trivariate
econometric model with ordinal-continuous outcomes is employed, which jointly
estimates AV acceptance (ordinal), perceived AV safety concern (ordinal), and
current annual vehicle-miles traveled (VMT) approximating the current travel
behavior (continuous). Importantly, the co-estimation of the three endogenous
outcomes allows to capture the true interdependencies among them, net of any
correlated unobserved factors that can have common impacts on these outcomes.
Besides the classical socio-economic characteristics, the outcome variables are
further explained by the latent preferences for vehicle attributes (including
vehicle cost, reliability, performance, and refueling) and for existing shared
mobility systems. The model estimation results on a stated preference survey in
the State of California provide insights into proactive policies that can
popularize AVs through gearing towards the most affected population groups,
particularly vehicle cost-conscious, safety-concerned, and lower-VMT (such as
travel-restrictive) individuals.

focused on the CDW states in AV3Sb5 and FeGe, characterized by the 2a0 by 2a0
period. Recently, a bulk CDW phase (T* ~ 92 K) with a different wave length and
orientation has been reported in ScV6Sn6, as the first realization of a CDW
state in the broad RM6X6 structure. Here, using a combination of scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy, we reveal the microscopic structure and the spectroscopic
signatures of this charge ordering phase in ScV6Sn6. Differential conductance
dI/dV spectra show a partial gap opening in the density-of-states of about 20
meV at the Fermi level. This is much smaller than the spectral gaps observed in
AV3Sb5 and FeGe despite the comparable T* temperatures in these systems,
suggesting substantially weaker coupling strength in ScV6Sn6. Surprisingly,
despite the three-dimensional bulk nature of the charge order, we find that the
charge modulation is only observed on the kagome termination.
Temperature-dependent band structure evolution suggests a modulation of the
surface states as a consequence of the emergent charge order, with an abrupt
spectral weight shift below T* consistent with the first-order phase
transition. The similarity of the electronic band structures of ScV6Sn6 and
TbV6Sn6 (where charge ordering is absent), together with the first-principle
calculations, suggests that charge ordering in ScV6Sn6 may not be primarily
electronically driven. Interestingly, in contrast to the CDW state of cousin
AV3Sb5, we find no evidence supporting rotation symmetry breaking. Our results
reveal a distinctive nature of the charge ordering phase in ScV6Sn6 in
comparison to other kagome metals.

e^{-V_*}$. When $\pi$ exhibits multiple modes, it is known that sampling
techniques based on Wasserstein gradient flows of the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence (e.g. Langevin Monte Carlo) suffer poorly in the rate of
convergence, where the dynamics are unable to easily traverse between modes. In
stark contrast, the work of Lu et al. (2019; 2022) has shown that the gradient
flow of the KL with respect to the Fisher-Rao (FR) geometry exhibits a
convergence rate to $\pi$ is that \textit{independent} of the potential
function. In this short note, we complement these existing results in the
literature by providing an explicit expansion of
$\text{KL}(\rho_t^{\text{FR}}\|\pi)$ in terms of $e^{-t}$, where
$(\rho_t^{\text{FR}})_{t\geq 0}$ is the FR gradient flow of the KL divergence.
In turn, we are able to provide a clean asymptotic convergence rate, where the
burn-in time is guaranteed to be finite. Our proof is based on observing a
similarity between FR gradient flows and simulated annealing with linear
scaling, and facts about cumulant generating functions. We conclude with simple
synthetic experiments that demonstrate our theoretical findings are indeed
tight. Based on our numerics, we conjecture that the asymptotic rates of
convergence for Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flows are possibly related to
this expansion in some cases.

language learning study (conducted originally with human participants) and
evaluating the memorization and generalization capabilities of deep neural
networks with respect to the degree of structure in the input language. Our
results show striking similarities between humans and deep neural networks:
More structured linguistic input leads to more systematic generalization and
better convergence between humans and neural network agents and between
different neural agents. We then replicate this structure bias found in humans

(GPT-3), showing a similar benefit for structured linguistic input regarding
generalization systematicity and memorization errors. These findings show that

developed at nucleation, causing some cracking in the initial hydrate shell

During crystallization, the THF hydrate droplets developed a completely white

growth rates within the droplet resulted in the capture of tiny air bubbles

resulted in the OCL. These bubbles created structural inhomogeneities, which
may explain how the volumetric expansion of the droplets upon complete

advantages over the extremes of full-teleoperation and full-autonomy in many
settings. Traditional approaches to shared autonomy rely on knowledge of the
environment dynamics, a discrete space of user goals that is known a priori, or
knowledge of the user's policy -- assumptions that are unrealistic in many
domains. Recent works relax some of these assumptions by formulating shared
autonomy with model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL). In particular, they
no longer need knowledge of the goal space (e.g., that the goals are discrete
or constrained) or environment dynamics. However, they need knowledge of a
task-specific reward function to train the policy. Unfortunately, such reward
specification can be a difficult and brittle process. On top of that, the
formulations inherently rely on human-in-the-loop training, and that
necessitates them to prepare a policy that mimics users' behavior. In this
paper, we present a new approach to shared autonomy that employs a modulation
of the forward and reverse diffusion process of diffusion models. Our approach
does not assume known environment dynamics or the space of user goals, and in
contrast to previous work, it does not require any reward feedback, nor does it
require access to the user's policy during training. Instead, our framework
learns a distribution over a space of desired behaviors. It then employs a
diffusion model to translate the user's actions to a sample from this
distribution. Crucially, we show that it is possible to carry out this process
in a manner that preserves the user's control authority. We evaluate our
framework on a series of challenging continuous control tasks, and analyze its
ability to effectively correct user actions while maintaining their autonomy.

queries. By borrowing ideas from the related problem of uncertainty-based
active learning, we introduce several metrics to characterize the uncertainty
so as to select the most uncertain questions for annotation. Experimental
results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving
state-of-the-art on eight complex reasoning tasks. Further analyses of
different uncertainty metrics, pool sizes, zero-shot learning, and

interactions that exist among input features? Subsequently, how can we capture
these interactions using suitable data-driven methods? To answer this question,
we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of
redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy across input features, which we term the
PID statistics of a multimodal distribution. Using 2 newly proposed estimators
that scale to high-dimensional distributions, we demonstrate their usefulness
in quantifying the interactions within multimodal datasets, the nature of
interactions captured by multimodal models, and principled approaches for model
selection. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where
the PID statistics are known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID
estimation was previously impossible. Finally, to demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our approach, we present three case studies in pathology, mood
prediction, and robotic perception where our framework accurately recommends
strong multimodal models for each application.

semantic scene completion framework that can output complete 3D volumetric

start from a sparse set of visible and occupied voxel queries from depth

occluded or empty spaces. Therefore, starting with the featurization and
prediction of the visible structures is more reliable. Once we obtain the set
of sparse queries, we apply a masked autoencoder design to propagate the

been extensively studied. In this case, an attack is generated from a known

decision of an unknown (black-box) model trained on an image dataset. However,
attacks generated from image models do not capture the dynamic nature of a
moving object or a changing scene due to a lack of temporal cues within image
models. This leads to reduced transferability of adversarial attacks from
representation-enriched \emph{image} models such as Supervised Vision
Transformers (ViTs), Self-supervised ViTs (\eg, DINO), and Vision-language
models (\eg, CLIP) to black-box \emph{video} models. In this work, we induce
dynamic cues within the image models without sacrificing their original
performance on images. To this end, we optimize \emph{temporal prompts} through
frozen image models to capture motion dynamics. Our temporal prompts are the
result of a learnable transformation that allows optimizing for temporal
gradients during an adversarial attack to fool the motion dynamics.
Specifically, we introduce spatial (image) and temporal (video) cues within the
same source model through task-specific prompts. Attacking such prompts
maximizes the adversarial transferability from image-to-video and
image-to-image models using the attacks designed for image models. Our attack

  Hardness: We show that checking a certain first-order approximate

implies that testing a certain stationarity concept for a modern nonsmooth
neural network is in general computationally intractable. As a corollary, we
prove that testing so-called first-order minimality for functions in abs-normal

validity of an equality-type subdifferential chain rule in terms of Clarke,
Fr\'echet, and limiting subdifferentials of the empirical loss of two-layer
ReLU networks. This new condition is simple and efficiently checkable.
  Robust algorithms: We introduce an algorithmic scheme to test
near-approximate stationarity in terms of both Clarke and Fr\'echet
subdifferentials. Our scheme makes no false positive or false negative error

(SFR) and properties of the star-forming molecular gas on 1.5 kpc scales across
80 nearby galaxies. These relationships, commonly referred to as ""star
formation laws,"" aim at predicting the local SFR surface density from various
combinations of molecular gas surface density, galactic orbital time, molecular
cloud free-fall time, and the interstellar medium dynamical equilibrium
pressure. Leveraging a multiwavelength database built for the PHANGS survey, we
measure these quantities consistently across all galaxies and quantify
systematic uncertainties stemming from choices of SFR calibrations and the
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors. The star formation laws we examine show 0.3-0.4
dex of intrinsic scatter, among which the molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt relation
shows a $\sim$10% larger scatter than the other three. The slope of this
relation ranges $\beta\approx0.9{-}1.2$, implying that the molecular gas
depletion time remains roughly constant across the environments probed in our
sample. The other relations have shallower slopes ($\beta\approx0.6{-}1.0$),
suggesting that the star formation efficiency (SFE) per orbital time, the SFE
per free-fall time, and the pressure-to-SFR surface density ratio (i.e., the
feedback yield) may vary systematically with local molecular gas and SFR
surface densities. Last but not least, the shapes of the star formation laws
depend sensitively on methodological choices. Different choices of SFR
calibrations can introduce systematic uncertainties of at least 10-15% in the
star formation law slopes and 0.15-0.25 dex in their normalization, while the
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors can additionally produce uncertainties of 20-25%

the stellar mass of the galaxy (M*) and the mass of the host halo (Mh). After
controlling for M* and Mh, the stacked spectra of centrals and satellites
beyond the effective radius (r_e) show small, yet significant differences in
multiple spectral features at the 1% level. According to spectral fitting with
the code alf, a primary driver of these differences appears to be [Mg/Fe]
variations, suggesting that stellar populations in the outskirts of satellites
formed more rapidly than the outer populations of centrals. To probe the
physical mechanisms that may be responsible for this signal, we examined how
satellite stellar populations depend on Mh. We find that satellites in high-Mh
halos show older stellar ages, lower [Fe/H], and higher [Mg/Fe] compared to
satellites in low-Mh halos, especially for M*=10^{9.5}-10^{10.5} Msun. These
signals lend support to environmentally driven processes that quench satellite

and in relativistic astrophysical systems it is regarded as a prime candidate
for powering fast and bright flares. We present a novel analytical model -
supported and benchmarked with large-scale three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations - that elucidates the physics governing the generation of power-law
energy spectra in relativistic reconnection. Particles with Lorentz factor
$\gamma\gtrsim 3\sigma$ (here, $\sigma$ is the magnetization) gain most of
their energy in the inflow region, while meandering between the two sides of
the reconnection layer. Their acceleration time is $t_{\rm acc}\sim \gamma
\,\eta_{\rm rec}^{-1}\omega_{\rm c}^{-1}\simeq 20\,\gamma\,\omega_{\rm
c}^{-1}$, where $\eta_{\rm rec}\simeq0.06$ is the inflow speed in units of the
speed of light and $\omega_{\rm c}=eB_0/mc$ is the gyrofrequency in the
upstream magnetic field. They leave the region of active energization after
$t_{\rm esc}$, when they get captured by one of the outflowing flux ropes of
reconnected plasma. We directly measure $t_{\rm esc}$ in our simulations and
find that $t_{\rm esc}\sim t_{\rm acc}$ for $\sigma\gtrsim {\rm few}$. This
leads to a universal (i.e., $\sigma$-independent) power-law spectrum $dN_{\rm
free}/d\gamma\propto \gamma^{-1}$ for the particles undergoing active
acceleration, and $dN/d\gamma\propto \gamma^{-2}$ for the overall particle
population. Our results help shedding light on the ubiquitous presence of
power-law particle and photon spectra in astrophysical non-thermal sources.

and accurate covariance estimates. One significant but sometimes misunderstood
component of the covariance is the so-called super-sample covariance (SSC). The
SSC is regularly defined as the covariance part capturing all impact of modes
outside of a survey area. However, we show here that this intuition is
incorrect for real-space statistics. We derive the covariance of second-order
shear statistics from first principles. For this, we use an estimator in real
space without relying on an estimator for the power spectrum. All parts of the
covariance, not only the SSC, depend on the power- and trispectrum at all
modes, including those larger than the survey. The defining feature of the SSC
is not its dependence on ``super-survey modes'' but its behaviour under the
`large-field approximation', i.e., the limiting case of a very large survey
area. While the non-SSC parts of the covariance scale with the inverse survey
area in this limit, the SSC completely vanishes. We also show that it is
generally impossible to transform an estimate for the power spectrum covariance
to the covariance of a real-space statistic. Such a transformation is only
possible in the limiting case of the `large-field approximation'. Additionally,
we find that the total covariance of a real-space statistic can be completely
estimated using correlation functions measured only inside the survey area.
Consequently, estimating covariances of real-space statistics, in principle,
does not require information outside the survey boundaries.

context of continuously-monitored open quantum systems, where information is
gained by measuring the environment interacting with the energy-storing quantum

between the ergotropy and the energy of the corresponding unconditional state.
The upper bound is achieved by assuming an initial pure state and a perfectly
efficient projective measurement on the environment, independently of the kind
of measurement performed. On the other hand, if the measurement is inefficient
or the initial state is mixed, the daemonic ergotropy is generally dependent on
the measurement strategy. This scenario is investigated via a paradigmatic

backscattering, and the ensuing increase in the resistance. We show that there

from resonant midgap states weakly coupled to the edge. The singular behavior
persists for both coherent and incoherent edge transport regimes. We use the
developed theory to fit the experimental data for the magnetoresistance for

suggest that the cusp-like behavior of the resistance in weak magnetic fields

  Asymptotically Optimal Error",,,,,"cs.DS cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a polynomial-time algorithm for robustly learning an unknown
affine transformation of the standard hypercube from samples, an important and
well-studied setting for independent component analysis (ICA). Specifically,
given an $\epsilon$-corrupted sample from a distribution $D$ obtained by
applying an unknown affine transformation $x \rightarrow Ax+s$ to the uniform
distribution on a $d$-dimensional hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, our algorithm
constructs $\hat{A}, \hat{s}$ such that the total variation distance of the
distribution $\hat{D}$ from $D$ is $O(\epsilon)$ using poly$(d)$ time and
samples. Total variation distance is the information-theoretically strongest
possible notion of distance in our setting and our recovery guarantees in this
distance are optimal up to the absolute constant factor multiplying $\epsilon$.
In particular, if the columns of $A$ are normalized to be unit length, our
total variation distance guarantee implies a bound on the sum of the $\ell_2$
distances between the column vectors of $A$ and $A'$, $\sum_{i =1}^d
\|a_i-\hat{a}_i\|_2 = O(\epsilon)$. In contrast, the strongest known prior
results only yield a $\epsilon^{O(1)}$ (relative) bound on the distance between
individual $a_i$'s and their estimates and translate into an $O(d\epsilon)$
bound on the total variation distance. Our key innovation is a new approach to
ICA (even to outlier-free ICA) that circumvents the difficulties in the
classical method of moments and instead relies on a new geometric certificate
of correctness of an affine transformation. Our algorithm is based on a new
method that iteratively improves an estimate of the unknown affine
transformation whenever the requirements of the certificate are not met.

much more than BLOOM. In addition, even though both models are highly biased
toward the formal style when prompted neutrally, we find that the models
generate a significant amount of informal predictions even when prompted with

learning model to solve robust optimization problems. The majority of existing
studies on deep learning focus on the model learning capability, while assuming
the quality and accuracy of the inputs data can be guaranteed. However, in
realistic applications of deep learning for solving optimization problems, the
accuracy of inputs, which are the problem parameters in this case, plays a
large role. This is because, in many situations, it is often costly or sometime
impossible to obtain the problem parameters accurately, and correspondingly, it
is highly desirable to develop learning algorithms that can account for the
uncertainties in the input and produce solutions that are robust against these
uncertainties. This paper presents a novel uncertainty injection scheme for
training machine learning models that are capable of implicitly accounting for
the uncertainties and producing statistically robust solutions. We further
identify the wireless communications as an application field where
uncertainties are prevalent in problem parameters such as the channel
coefficients. We show the effectiveness of the proposed training scheme in two

including energy, control, and economics, to make robust decisions under
uncertainty. One of the classical solution methods in NRO is an outer
approximation method that iteratively solves a sample-based nonlinear problem
and updates the sample set by solving an auxiliary problem subject to the
uncertainty set. Although it guarantees convergence under certain assumptions,
its solution iterates are generally infeasible in the original NRO problem, and
it provides only a lower bound on the optimal objective value. We propose a new
algorithm for a class of NRO problems that generates feasible solution iterates
and provides both lower and upper bounds to the optimal objective value. In
each iteration, the algorithm solves the reformulation of an NRO subproblem
with respect to the polytopic supersets of the original uncertainty set and
uses a cutting plane method to improve the supersets over iteration. If the NRO
subproblem is infeasible, we provide a feasibility restoration step to detect
whether the original NRO problem is infeasible or construct a new superset to
restore the feasibility of the NRO subproblem. Further, we prove that our
superset algorithm converges to the optimal solution of the original NRO
problem. In numerical studies, we use application instances from portfolio
optimization and production cost minimization and compare the performance
between the superset algorithm and an outer approximation method called Polak's
algorithm. Our result shows that the superset algorithm is more advantageous
than Polak's algorithm when the number of robust constraints is large.

accelerators, proceed through their maturation into one of the fastest growing
areas of beam-based science, and give a look into their emerging importance in
applications. An important aspect of advanced accelerators is their
relationship to other burgeoning fields, particularly free-electron lasers. The
framework of this retelling lends itself particularly well to illustrating this

team nature of our field, and the contributions of participants from all

translated into breakthroughs in AI applications. With successes in bottom-up
challenges partially overshadowing shortcomings, the 'human-like' performance
of Large Language Models has raised the question of how linguistic performance
is achieved by algorithms. Given systematic shortcomings in generalization
across many AI systems, in this work we ask whether linguistic performance is
indeed guided by language knowledge in Large Language Models. To this end, we
prompt GPT-3 with a grammaticality judgement task and comprehension questions
on less frequent constructions that are thus unlikely to form part of Large
Language Models' training data. These included grammatical 'illusions',
semantic anomalies, complex nested hierarchies and self-embeddings. GPT-3
failed for every prompt but one, often offering answers that show a critical
lack of understanding even of high-frequency words used in these less frequent
grammatical constructions. The present work sheds light on the boundaries of
the alleged AI human-like linguistic competence and argues that, far from
human-like, the next-word prediction abilities of LLMs may face issues of
robustness, when pushed beyond training data.

aim is to understand, which parts of the input sample have highest relevance
and hence most influence on the model prediction. Relevance can be traced back
through the network to attribute a certain score to each input pixel. Relevance
scores are then combined and displayed as heat maps and give humans an
intuitive visual understanding of classification models. Opening the black box
to understand the classification engine in great detail is essential for domain
experts to gain trust in ANN models. However, there are pitfalls in terms of
model-inherent artifacts included in the obtained relevance maps, that can
easily be missed. But for a valid interpretation, these artifacts must not be

the distribution of price returns. However, research so far has only considered
Bitcoin or at most a few cryptocurrencies, whilst ignoring that price returns

Here, we therefore present a comprehensive investigation of large price

price returns change with the coming-of-age and growth of the cryptocurrency

functions over the entire history of the considered cryptocurrency portfolio,
with typical exponents implying the absence of characteristic scales for price
variations in about half of them. Moreover, these tail distributions are
asymmetric as positive returns more often display smaller exponents, indicating
that large positive price variations are more likely than negative ones. Our
results further reveal that changes in the tail exponents are very often
simultaneously related to cryptocurrency age and market capitalization or only
to age, with only a minority of cryptoassets being affected just by market
capitalization or neither of the two quantities. Lastly, we find that the
trends in power-law exponents usually point to mixed directions, and that large

generate a safe sequence of actions competitive with the best minimizer
sequence in hindsight, and the gap between the two sequences is quantified via
dynamic regret. We propose distributed safe online gradient descent
(D-Safe-OGD) with an exploration phase, where all agents estimate the
constraint parameters collaboratively to build estimated feasible sets,
ensuring the action selection safety during the optimization phase. We prove
that for convex functions, D-Safe-OGD achieves a dynamic regret bound of
$O(T^{2/3} \sqrt{\log T} + T^{1/3}C_T^*)$, where $C_T^*$ denotes the
path-length of the best minimizer sequence. We further prove a dynamic regret

models utilized for the investigations, were first subjected to QMM
calibrations with measurements from three different propagation scenarios.
Then, the nominal models were recast in forms suitable for Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) calibration before being calibrated with both the SVD and
QMM algorithms. The prediction performances of the calibrated models as
evaluated in terms of Root Mean Square Prediction Error (RMSE), Mean Prediction
Error (MPE), and Grey Relational Grade Mean Absolute Percentage Error (GRG
MAPE) very clearly indicate that the uniqueness of QMM calibrations of basic
pathloss models is more readily observable, when the basic models are recast in
forms specific to SVD calibration. In the representative case of calibration
with indoor to outdoor measurements, RMSE values were recorded for QMM
calibrated nominal models as 5.2639dB for the ECC33 model, and 5.3218dB for the
other nominal models. Corresponding metrics for the alternative (rearranged)
nominal models emerged as 5.2663dB for the ECC33 model and 5.2591dB for the
other models. A similar general trend featured in the GRG MAPE metrics, which
for both SVD and QMM calibrations of all the alternative models, was recorded
as 0.9131, but differed slightly (between 0.9138 and 0.9196) for the QMM
calibration of the nominal models. The slight differences between these metrics
(due to computational round off approximations) confirm that when the
components of basic models are linearly independent, the QMM solution is
unique.

further conducted data-driven investigations into the two core challenges: (i)
low-quality author-written captions and (ii) the absence of a standard for good

the local tidal gradient, contaminating any cosmology derived from the lensing
signal. We measure this intrinsic alignment in Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1

galaxies within clusters between redshift 0.1-0.7. We find a significant
systematic in the measured ellipticities of cluster satellite galaxies that we
attribute to the central galaxy flux and other intracluster light. We attempt
to correct this signal, and fit a simple model for intrinsic alignment
amplitude ($A_{\textrm{IA}}$) to the measurement, finding
$A_{\textrm{IA}}=0.15\pm 0.04$, when excluding data near the edge of the

central galaxy absolute magnitude (proxies for cluster mass). This is an

Unfortunately, a straightforward comparison of the characteristic relaxation
times for the temperature and density, on the one hand, and pressure, on the

approach in the situation when the free-path length of the protons is
considerably greater than the spatial scale of the structures under

reducing the effective free paths - are usually assumed. In the present paper,
we use an alternative approach based on the electrostatic (Langmuir)
turbulence, described by the mathematical formalism of the spin-type
Hamiltonians, which was actively discussed in the recent time in the literature
on statistical physics. As follows from the corresponding calculations,
formation of the anticorrelated distributions of temperature and density is a
universal property of the strongly-nonequilibrium plasmas governed by the
spin-type Hamiltonians when they gradually approach the thermodynamic
equilibrium. So, just this phenomenon could be responsible for the
anticorrelations observed in the solar wind.

nanomagnetism and spintronics, these velocities are often limited either by
internal domain wall instabilities, known as the Walker breakdown phenomenon,
or by spin wave emission, known as the magnonic regime. In the rigid domain
wall model, the maximum magnon velocity acts as an effective ""speed of light"",
providing a relativistic analogy for the domain wall speed limitation.
Cylindrical magnetic nanowires are an example of systems with the absence of
the Walker breakdown phenomenon. Here we demonstrate that in cylindrical
nanowires with high magnetization such as Iron, also the magnonic limit could
be outstandingly surpassed. Our numerical modelling shows the Bloch point
domain wall velocities as high as 14 km/s, well above the magnonic limit
estimated in the interval 1.7-2.0 km/s. The key ingredient is the conical shape
of the domain wall which elongates and breaks during the dynamics, leading to
domain wall acceleration due to the jet propulsion effect. This effect will be
very important for three-dimensional spintronic networks based on cylindrical

statistical bias. Prior work addresses these concerns but only for regularly
spaced locations, while raising other issues, most notably its inability to
discern regions that are likely to exhibit spatial unfairness. Similar to
established notions of algorithmic fairness, we define spatial fairness as the
statistical independence of outcomes from location. This translates into
requiring that for each region of space, the distribution of outcomes is
identical inside and outside the region. To allow for localized discrepancies
in the distribution of outcomes, we compare how well two competing hypotheses
explain the observed outcomes. The null hypothesis assumes spatial fairness,
while the alternate allows different distributions inside and outside regions.
Their goodness of fit is then assessed by a likelihood ratio test. If there is

empirical evidence points to the limitations of PIDL for learning certain types

Detailed in the case study, we present the contradistinction in PIDL results

standard bit mutation is replaced by an arbitrary unbiased mutation operator.

this includes some of the heavy-tail mutation operators used in fast genetic

$\sigma+\pi$ origin, whose magnitude is yet uncertain and debated. Partial
quenching of $\pi$ magnetism has been ubiquitously reported in periodic
$first-principles$ calculations, with magnetic moments scattered in the range
1.0 - 2.0 $\mu_{B}$, slowly converging to the lower or the upper end, depending
on how the diluted limit is approached. By contrast, (ensemble) density
functional theory calculations on cluster models neatly converge to the value
of $2$ $\mu_{B}$ when increasing the system size. This stunning discrepancy has
sparked an ongoing debate about the role of defect-defect interactions and
self-doping, and about the importance of the self-interaction-error in the
density-functional-theory description of the vacancy-induced states.
  Here, we settle this puzzle by showing that the problem has a fundamental,
mono-electronic origin which is related to the special (periodic) arrangement
of defects that results when using the slab-supercell approach. Specifically,
we report the existence of resonant states that are $anomalously$ delocalized
over the lattice and that make the $\pi$ midgap band $unphysically$ dispersive,
hence prone to self-doping and quenching of the $\pi$ magnetism. Hybrid
functionals fix the problem by widening the gap between the spin-resolved $\pi$
midgap bands, without reducing their artificial widths. As a consequence, while
reconciling the magnetic moment with expectations, they predict a
spin-splitting which is one order of magnitude larger than found in

Magnetic fields play a fundamental role in the dynamical evolution
of protoplanetary disks, in particular via magnetically induced disk winds. The
magnetic field structure at the disk surface is crucial for driving the disk
winds; however, it is still poorly understood observationally. Aims. We explore
a new method to probe the magnetic field structure at the disk surface using
near-infrared (NIR) circular polarization. Near-infrared circular polarization
arises when unpolarized stellar light is scattered by magnetically aligned
grains at the disk surface. In this study, we aim to clarify to what extent the
observed circular polarization pattern can be used to diagnose the magnetic
field structure. Methods. We first calculated light scattering properties of
aligned spheroids, and the results were then used to create expected
observational images of the degree of circular polarization at a NIR
wavelength. Results. Magnetically aligned grains can produce circular
polarization, particularly when the field configuration deviates from a purely
toroidal field. We find that disk azimuthal dependence of the degree of
circular polarization tends to exhibit a double peaked profile when the field
structure is favorable for driving disk winds by centrifugal force. We also
find that even if the disk is spatially unresolved, a net circular polarization
can possibly be nonzero. We also show that the amplitude of circular
polarization is strongly dependent on grain composition and axis ratio.
Conclusions. Our results suggest that circular polarization observations would
be useful to study the magnetic field structure and dust properties at the disk
surface.

To ensure unique identifiability of causal directions, researchers consider
restricted subclasses of structural causal models. Post-nonlinear (PNL) causal
models constitute one of the most flexible options for such restricted
subclasses, containing in particular the popular additive noise models as a
further subclass. However, learning PNL models is not well studied beyond the
bivariate case. The existing methods learn non-linear functional relations by
minimizing residual dependencies and subsequently test independence from
residuals to determine causal orientations. However, these methods can be prone
to overfitting and, thus, difficult to tune appropriately in practice. As an
alternative, we propose a new approach for PNL causal discovery that uses
rank-based methods to estimate the functional parameters. This new approach
exploits natural invariances of PNL models and disentangles the estimation of
the non-linear functions from the independence tests used to find causal
orientations. We prove consistency of our method and validate our results in

predictions are rarely so accurate that they can be trusted blindly. Clinicians
therefore tend to favor ""interpretable"" classifiers over opaque LLMs. For
example, risk prediction tools are often linear models defined over manually
crafted predictors that must be laboriously extracted from EHRs. We propose
CHiLL (Crafting High-Level Latents), which uses LLMs to permit natural language
specification of high-level features for linear models via zero-shot feature
extraction using expert-composed queries. This approach has the promise to
empower physicians to use their domain expertise to craft features which are
clinically meaningful for a downstream task of interest, without having to
manually extract these from raw EHR (as often done now). We are motivated by a
real-world risk prediction task, but as a reproducible proxy, we use MIMIC-III

evaluate our approach. We find that linear models using automatically extracted

provide greater interpretability than linear models using ""Bag-of-Words""

We propose a theoretical framework for studying reward learning and the
associated optimal experiment design problem. Our framework models rewards and
policies as nonparametric functions belonging to subsets of Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). The learner receives (noisy) oracle access to a true
reward and must output a policy that performs well under the true reward. For
this setting, we first derive non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for a simple
plug-in estimator based on ridge regression. We then solve the query design
problem by optimizing these risk bounds with respect to the choice of query set
and obtain a finite sample statistical rate, which depends primarily on the
eigenvalue spectrum of a certain linear operator on the RKHSs. Despite the
generality of these results, our bounds are stronger than previous bounds
developed for more specialized problems. We specifically show that the
well-studied problem of Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization is a special
case of our framework, and that our bounds either improve or are competitive

difficulty behind adversarially robust domain adaptation (or robustness
transfer), we propose to analyze a key complexity measure that controls the
cross-domain generalization: the adversarial Rademacher complexity over {\em

linear models, we show that adversarial version of this complexity is always
greater than the non-adversarial one, which reveals the intrinsic hardness of

automatons to autonomously restructure an asteroid into a large rotating space
station. The restructuring process makes structures from asteroid oxide
materials; uses productive self-replication to make replicators, helpers, and
products; and creates a multiple floor station to support a large population.
In an example simulation, it takes 12 years to autonomously restructure a large
asteroid into the space station. This is accomplished with a single rocket
launch. The single payload contains a base station, 4 robots (spiders), and a
modest set of supplies. Our simulation creates 3000 spiders and over 23,500
other pieces of equipment. Only the base station and spiders (replicators) have
advanced microprocessors and algorithms. These represent 21st century
technologies created and trans-ported from Earth. The equipment and tools are
built using in-situ materials and represent 18th or 19th century technologies.
The equipment and tools (helpers) have simple mechanical programs to perform
repetitive tasks. The resulting example station would be a rotating framework
almost 5 kilometers in diameter. Once completed, it could support a population
of over 700,000 people. Many researchers identify the high launch costs, the
harsh space environment, and the lack of gravity as the key obstacles hindering
the development of space stations. The single probe addresses the high launch
cost. The autonomous construction eliminates the harsh space environment for
construction crews. The completed rotating station provides radiation
protection and centripetal gravity for the first work crews and colonists.

can manipulate their observable features in predefined ways, modeled by a
manipulation graph, in order to receive a positive classification. We show this
setting differs in fundamental ways from non-strategic online classification.
For instance, whereas in the non-strategic case, a mistake bound of $\ln|H|$ is
achievable via the halving algorithm when the target function belongs to a
known class $H$, we show that no deterministic algorithm can achieve a mistake
bound $o(\Delta)$ in the strategic setting, where $\Delta$ is the maximum
degree of the manipulation graph (even when $|H|=O(\Delta)$). We obtain an
algorithm achieving mistake bound $O(\Delta\ln|H|)$. We also extend this to the
agnostic setting and obtain an algorithm with a $\Delta$ multiplicative regret,
and we show no deterministic algorithm can achieve $o(\Delta)$ multiplicative
regret.
  Next, we study two randomized models based on whether the random choices are
made before or after agents respond, and show they exhibit fundamental
differences. In the first model, at each round the learner deterministically
chooses a probability distribution over classifiers inducing expected values on
each vertex (probabilities of being classified as positive), which the
strategic agents respond to. We show that any learner in this model has to
suffer linear regret. On the other hand, in the second model, while the
adversary who selects the next agent must respond to the learner's probability
distribution over classifiers, the agent then responds to the actual hypothesis
classifier drawn from this distribution. Surprisingly, we show this model is
more advantageous to the learner, and we design randomized algorithms that
achieve sublinear regret bounds against both oblivious and adaptive
adversaries.

designing powerful graph neural networks (GNNs) with relieving human efforts.
However, existing graph NAS methods mainly work under the homophily assumption
and overlook another important graph property, i.e., heterophily, which exists
widely in various real-world applications. To date, automated heterophilic
graph learning with NAS is still a research blank to be filled in. Due to the
complexity and variety of heterophilic graphs, the critical challenge of
heterophilic graph NAS mainly lies in developing the heterophily-specific
search space and strategy. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
automated graph neural network on heterophilic graphs, namely Auto-HeG, to
automatically build heterophilic GNN models with expressive learning abilities.
Specifically, Auto-HeG incorporates heterophily into all stages of automatic
heterophilic graph learning, including search space design, supernet training,
and architecture selection. Through the diverse message-passing scheme with
joint micro-level and macro-level designs, we first build a comprehensive
heterophilic GNN search space, enabling Auto-HeG to integrate complex and
various heterophily of graphs. With a progressive supernet training strategy,
we dynamically shrink the initial search space according to layer-wise
variation of heterophily, resulting in a compact and efficient supernet. Taking
a heterophily-aware distance criterion as the guidance, we conduct heterophilic
architecture selection in the leave-one-out pattern, so that specialized and
expressive heterophilic GNN architectures can be derived. Extensive experiments
illustrate the superiority of Auto-HeG in developing excellent heterophilic
GNNs to human-designed models and graph NAS models.

give a result for the case where instead of a tight estimate for each

very simple, and is flexible enough that if we instead assume tight estimates
on the variables, then we recover the conclusion of the standard differential

superhuman play in chess, shogi, and Go via policy iteration. To be an
effective policy improvement operator, AlphaZero's search requires accurate
value estimates for the states appearing in its search tree. AlphaZero trains
upon self-play matches beginning from the initial state of a game and only
samples actions over the first few moves, limiting its exploration of states
deeper in the game tree. We introduce Go-Exploit, a novel search control
strategy for AlphaZero. Go-Exploit samples the start state of its self-play
trajectories from an archive of states of interest. Beginning self-play
trajectories from varied starting states enables Go-Exploit to more effectively
explore the game tree and to learn a value function that generalizes better.
Producing shorter self-play trajectories allows Go-Exploit to train upon more
independent value targets, improving value training. Finally, the exploration
inherent in Go-Exploit reduces its need for exploratory actions, enabling it to
train under more exploitative policies. In the games of Connect Four and 9x9
Go, we show that Go-Exploit learns with a greater sample efficiency than
standard AlphaZero, resulting in stronger performance against reference
opponents and in head-to-head play. We also compare Go-Exploit to KataGo, a
more sample efficient reimplementation of AlphaZero, and demonstrate that
Go-Exploit has a more effective search control strategy. Furthermore,
Go-Exploit's sample efficiency improves when KataGo's other innovations are
incorporated.

AT, referred to as Fast AT, reducing the overhead of adversarial example

Specifically, we propose to minimize redundancies at the data level by

its unpruned counterparts while being significantly faster. For instance,
proposed strategies accelerate CIFAR-10 training up to 3.44X and CIFAR-100

quasi-incompressible elastodynamics based on different variational
formulations, the one in the fully incompressible regime has yet been

a new Hamiltonian for fully incompressible elastodynamics. Invoking the
discrete gradient formula, we are able to design fully-discrete schemes that
preserve the Hamiltonian and momenta. The scaled mid-point formula, another

does not impose additional restrictions for the algorithmic stress to respect
the invariants, leading to an energy-decaying and momentum-conserving fully
discrete scheme. A set of numerical examples is provided to justify the claimed
properties. The grad-div stabilization is found to enhance the discrete mass
conservation effectively. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional algorithms
based on Cardano's formula and perturbation techniques, the spectral
decomposition algorithm developed by Scherzinger and Dohrmann is robust and
accurate to ensure the discrete conservation laws and is thus recommended for
stretch-based material modeling.

partial differential equations that describe the dynamics of the bosonic part
of a M2-brane compactified on $M_9\times T^2$ in the LCG with worldvolume
fluxes that can be induced by a constant and quantized supergravity 3-form.
This sector of the theory, at supersymmetric level, has the interesting
property of having a discrete spectrum. In this paper we focus in the
characterization of Q-ball solitons on the M2-brane with worldvolume fluxes. We
obtain two analytic families of Q-ball-like solutions that satisfy all of the
constraints. We analyze two different scenarios: one in which the system is in
an isotropic case and other anisotropic. In the first case we obtain two
analytic families of solutions in the presence of a non-vanishing symplectic
gauge field. We show that the solutions exhibit generically dispersion although
they also admit solutions dispersion-free. We obtain the superposition law of
the analytic solutions. They admit linear superposition but only for restricted
discrete frequencies. In the non-isotropic case, we show numerically, that the
system also admits Q-ball solutions, even for the simple backgrounds like the
one that we are considering. The dynamics of the Q-balls are also encountered.
We analyze the Lorentz boosts and Galilean transformations. Since we work in
the light cone gauge, the Lorentz transformed solutions are not automatically
solutions, rather some conditions must be imposed. Only a subset of the
solutions remain. We discuss some examples. The Q-ball solitons of the M2-brane
have a mass term that contains an interaction term between the Noether charge
of the Q-ball and the topological monopole charge associated with the
worldvolume flux. These solutions could be related to the new type of solitons
denoted as Q-monopole-ball.

backscattering yields between the domains. However, we found that it is
possible to observe the type-II magnetic domain contrast even in cases where
the backscattering coefficients of the domains are the same. The contrast
arises from the electron-scattering anisotropy created because of the
deflection of the electron trajectories by the Lorentz force. We verify this by
distinguishing all four possible in-plane magnetisation vectors on a Fe-Si(100)
surface, using an electron backscatter diffraction detector as an arrya of
electron detectors. The change in contrast between the magnetic domains, with
respect to the location of a virtual electron detector, can provide information
on the directions of the magnetisation vectors. A method to suppress the

G-splines are more suitable for IGA than EP constructions based on the D-patch

the majority of parameter space, moons are not necessary to maintain stable
obliquity. Further, we consider various proposed mechanisms for water delivery
to the early Earth, including delivery from asteroids, both during giant planet

the U-shaped density of states (DOS) deforms to the V-shaped one along with the

potential tool to control or eliminate \textit{P. vivax}. We have developed a
multiscale mathematical model as a system of integro-differential equations
that captures the complex dynamics of \textit{P. vivax} hypnozoites and the
effect of hypnozoite relapse on disease transmission. Here, we use our model to
study the anticipated effect of radical cure treatment administered via a mass
drug administration (MDA) program. We implement multiple rounds of MDA with a
fixed interval between rounds, starting from different steady-state disease
prevalences. We then construct an optimisation model to obtain the optimal MDA
interval. We also incorporate mosquito seasonality in our model to study its
effect on the optimal treatment regime. We find that the effect of MDA
interventions is temporary and depends on the pre-intervention disease
prevalence (and choice of model parameters) as well as the number of MDA rounds
under consideration. We find radical cure alone may not be enough to lead to

elliptical galaxies have been invoked to suggest the possibility of a
cosmological coupling between astrophysical black holes and the surrounding
expanding Universe, offering a mechanism for black holes to grow over cosmic

show that the mass functions of the two radial velocity black hole candidates

features, for which an explosion of a super-massive white dwarf (WD) beyond the
classical Chandrasekhar-limiting mass has been suggested, largely based on
their high luminosities and slow light-curve evolution. However, their
observational features are diverse, with a few extremely peculiar features
whose origins have not been clarified; strong and persisting C II lines,
late-time accelerated luminosity decline and red spectra, and a sub-day
time-scale initial flash clearly identified so far at least for three
over-luminous SNe Ia. In the present work, we suggest a scenario that provides
a unified solution to these peculiarities, through hydrodynamic and radiation
transfer simulations together with analytical considerations; a C+O-rich
envelope (~0.01 - 0.1 Msun) attached to an exploding WD. Strong C II lines are
created within the shocked envelope. Dust formation is possible in the late
phase, providing a sufficient optical depth thereafter. The range of the
envelope mass considered here predicts an initial flash with time-scale of ~0.5
- 3 days. The scenario thus can explain some of the key diverse observational
properties by a different amount of the envelope, but additional factors are
also required; we argue that the envelope is distributed in a disc-like
structure, and also the ejecta properties, e.g., the mass of the WD, plays a
key role. Within the context of the hypothesized super-Chandrasekhar-mass WD
scenario, we speculatively suggest a progenitor WD evolution including a
spin-up accretion phase followed by a spin-down mass-ejection phase.

explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which may be counter-productive to
better human decision making. In early decision support systems, we assumed
that we could give people recommendations and that they would consider them,
and then follow them when required. However, research found that people often
ignore recommendations because they do not trust them; or perhaps even worse,
people follow them blindly, even when the recommendations are wrong.
Explainable artificial intelligence mitigates this by helping people to
understand how and why models give certain recommendations. However, recent
research shows that people do not always engage with explainability tools
enough to help improve decision making. The assumption that people will engage
with recommendations and explanations has proven to be unfounded. We argue this
is because we have failed to account for two things. First, recommendations
(and their explanations) take control from human decision makers, limiting
their agency. Second, giving recommendations and explanations does not align
with the cognitive processes employed by people making decisions. This position
paper proposes a new conceptual framework called Evaluative AI for explainable
decision support. This is a machine-in-the-loop paradigm in which decision
support tools provide evidence for and against decisions made by people, rather
than provide recommendations to accept or reject. We argue that this mitigates
issues of over- and under-reliance on decision support tools, and better
leverages human expertise in decision making.

study how a foam is spread by a rigid plate on a substrate as a function of
spreading velocity, gap height, confinement length, amount of foam and
wettability of the substrate. Three distinguishable spreading patterns were
found: homogeneous spreading, non-spreading, and slender spreading. It is also
found that the dynamics and the mechanism of the spreading can be explained by
coupling among dewetting, anchoring, shear stress, viscous stress and yield

shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test
samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is
often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the
real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite
common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find
that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability.
Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \ie,
group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms
does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into
the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients
may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \ie,
assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse
issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method,
called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial
noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat
minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising
results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is
computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

femtotesla sensitivity, but published experiments have largely been limited to
the picotesla level. Here, we demonstrate a femtotesla RF magnetometer based on
an NV-doped diamond membrane inserted between two ferrite flux concentrators.
The device operates in bias magnetic fields of 2-10 microtesla and provides a
~300-fold amplitude enhancement within the diamond for RF magnetic fields in
the 0.07-3.6 MHz range. The magnetometer's sensitivity is ~70 fT s^{1/2} at
0.35 MHz, and the noise floor decreases to below 2 fT after 1 hour of
acquisition. We used this sensor to detect the 3.6 MHz NQR signal of 14N in
sodium nitrite powder at room temperature. NQR signals are amplified by a
resonant RF coil wrapped around the sample, allowing for higher signal-to-noise
ratio detection. The diamond RF magnetometer's recovery time after a strong RF
pulse is ~35 us, limited by the coil ring-down time. The sodium-nitrite NQR
frequency shifts linearly with temperature as -1.00 +/- 0.02 kHz/K, the
magnetization dephasing time is T2* = 887 +/- 51 us, and a spin-lock spin-echo
pulse sequence extends the signal lifetime to 332 +/- 23 ms, all consistent
with coil-based NQR studies. Our results expand the sensitivity frontier of
diamond magnetometers to the femtotesla range, with potential applications in

between the p- and g-mode cavities must be understood well in order to derive
localised estimates of interior rotation from measurements of mode multiplet
rotational splittings. There exist now two different descriptions of this
coupling: one based on an asymptotic quantisation condition, and the other
arising from coupling matrices associated with ""acoustic molecular orbitals"".
We examine the analytic properties of both, and derive closed-form expressions
for various quantities -- such as the period-stretching function $\tau$ --
which previously had to be solved for numerically. Using these, we reconcile
both formulations for the first time, deriving relations by which quantities in
each formulation may be translated to and interpreted within the other. This
yields an information criterion for whether a given configuration of mixed
modes meaningfully constrains the parameters of the asymptotic construction,
which is likely not satisfied by the majority of first-ascent red giant stars
in our observational sample. Since this construction has been already used to
make rotational measurements of such red giants, we examine -- through a
hare-and-hounds exercise -- whether, and how, such limitations affect existing
measurements. While averaged estimates of core rotation seem fairly robust,
template-matching using the asymptotic construction has difficulty reliably
assigning rotational splittings to individual multiplets, or estimating mixing
fractions $\zeta$ of the most p-dominated mixed modes, where such estimates are
most needed. We finally discuss implications for extending the two-zone model
of radial differential rotation, e.g. via rotational inversions, with these
methods.

three-dimensional microfluidic device (the optimized uniaxial and biaxial
extensional rheometer, OUBER) for generating near-homogeneous uniaxial and
biaxial elongational flows. In this Part II of the paper, we employ the OUBER
device to examine the uniaxial and biaxial extensional rheology of some model
dilute polymer solutions. We also compare the results with measurements made
under planar extension in the optimized-shape cross-slot extensional rheometer
[or OSCER, Haward et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. (2012)]. In each case (uniaxial,
planar and biaxial extension), we use micro-particle image velocimetry to
measure the extension rate as a function of the imposed flow rate, and we
measure the excess pressure drop across each device in order to estimate the
tensile stress difference generated in the fluid. We present a new analysis,
based on solving the macroscopic power balance for flow through each device, to
refine the estimate of the tensile stress difference obtained from the measured
pressure drop. Based on this analysis, we find that for our most dilute polymer
sample, which is ""ultradilute"", the extensional viscosity is well described by
the finitely extensible non-linear elastic dumbbell model. In this limit, the
biaxial extensional viscosity at high Weissenberg numbers (Wi) is half that of
the uniaxial and planar extensional viscosities. At higher polymer
concentrations, the experimental measurements deviate from the model
predictions, which is attributed to the onset of intermolecular interactions as
polymers unravel in the extensional flows. Of practical significance (and
fundamental interest), elastic instability occurs at a significantly lower Wi
in uniaxial extensional flow than in either biaxial or planar extensional flow,
limiting the utility of this flow type for extensional viscosity measurement.

complex phases along the circumferential direction (AB effect), which modifies
the band structure. In particular, when the magnetic field is applied to
metallic CNTs, which can be regarded as one-dimensional massless Dirac systems,
realistic values of B lead to a nonzero gap in the THz regime. We demonstrate
that such change from gapless to gapped Dirac systems drastically increases the
HHG intensity in the THz regime. In the gapless Dirac system, the velocity of
each electron never changes under the electric field, and thus there is no HHG.
On the other hand, the gap opening activates both the interband and itraband
currents, which strongly contribute to HHG. Our work demonstrates a unique way
to manipulate HHG in nanotubes by tuning electronic wave functions using the
magnetic field and the tube structure.

fully exploit the potential of emotion prediction to enhance emotion-cause pair

emotion-cause pair extraction, we propose a synchronization mechanism to share
their improvement in the training process. That is, the improvement of emotion
prediction can facilitate the emotion-cause pair extraction, and then the
results of emotion-cause pair extraction can also be used to improve the
accuracy of emotion prediction simultaneously. For the emotion-cause pair
extraction, we divide it into genuine pair supervision and fake pair
supervision, where the genuine pair supervision learns from the pairs with more
possibility to be emotion-cause pairs. In contrast, fake pair supervision
learns from other pairs. In this way, the emotion-cause pairs can be extracted
directly from the genuine pair, thereby reducing the difficulty of extraction.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the 13 compared systems

pixel-level classification performance by iteratively upgrading the feature
extractor shared by two network. An object-level contrastive learning (OCL)
strategy is employed in the object classification sub-network featuring a
siamese network to realize the global features extraction, and a
sub-object-level contrastive learning (SOCL) paradigm is designed in the
semantic segmentation sub-network to efficiently extract salient features from

elaborated to fuse features in semantic space such that both object-level and
pixel-level classification performance are improved.

provide initial evidence supporting a novel technique utilizing drivers'
electroencephalography (EEG) signals to implicitly label hazardous driving
scenarios while passively viewing recordings of real-road driving, thus sparing
the need for manual annotation and avoiding human annotators' behavioral biases

animated recordings of driving scenarios and asked participants to report
danger explicitly whenever necessary. Behavioral results showed the
participants tended to report danger only when overt hazards (e.g., a vehicle
or a pedestrian appearing unexpectedly from behind an occlusion) were in view.
By contrast, their EEG signals were enhanced at the sight of both an overt
hazard and a covert hazard (e.g., an occlusion signalling possible appearance
of a vehicle or a pedestrian from behind). Thus, EEG signals were more
sensitive to driving hazards than explicit reports. Further, the Time-Series AI

candidate approaches for learning on neuromorphic chips learn by contrasting
one set of network states with another. These Contrastive Learning (CL)
algorithms are traditionally implemented with rigid, temporally non-local, and
periodic learning dynamics that could limit the range of physical systems
capable of harnessing CL. In this study, we build on recent work exploring how
CL might be implemented by biological or neurmorphic systems and show that this
form of learning can be made temporally local, and can still function even if
many of the dynamical requirements of standard training procedures are relaxed.
Thanks to a set of general theorems corroborated by numerical experiments

predetermined polynomial basis and learn the coefficients from the training

dependent on the property of the polynomial basis. Consequently, two natural
and fundamental questions arise: Can we learn a suitable polynomial basis from
the training data? Can we determine the optimal polynomial basis for a given
graph and node features?
  In this paper, we propose two spectral GNN models that provide positive
answers to the questions posed above. First, inspired by Favard's Theorem, we
propose the FavardGNN model, which learns a polynomial basis from the space of
all possible orthonormal bases. Second, we examine the supposedly unsolvable
definition of optimal polynomial basis from Wang & Zhang (2022) and propose a
simple model, OptBasisGNN, which computes the optimal basis for a given graph
structure and graph signal. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed models.

  Structure Functions","16 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new method to constrain the size of the dusty torus in
broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using optical and mid-infrared (MIR)
ensemble structure functions (SFs). Because of the geometric dilution of the
torus, the MIR response to optical continuum variations has suppressed
variability with respect to the optical that depends on the geometry (e.g.,
size, orientation, opening angle) of the torus. More extended tori have steeper
MIR SFs with respect to the optical SFs. We demonstrate the feasibility of this
SF approach using simulated AGN light curves and a geometric torus model. While
it is difficult to use SFs to constrain the orientation and opening angle due
to insensitivity of the SF on these parameters, the size of the torus can be
well determined. Applying this method to the ensemble SFs measured for 587 SDSS
quasars, we measure a torus $R-L$ relation of ${\rm log}\,R_{\rm eff}\, {(\rm
pc)} = 0.51_{-0.04}^{+0.04} \times {\rm log}\,(L_{\rm bol}/10^{46}\,\rm
erg\,s^{-1}) -0.38_{-0.01}^{+0.01}$ in the WISE $W1$ band, and sizes $\sim1.4$
times larger in the $W2$ band, which are in good agreement with dust
reverberation mapping measurements. Compared with the reverberation mapping
technique, the SF method is much less demanding in data quality and can be
applied to any optical+MIR light curves for which a lag measurement may not be
possible, as long as the variability process and torus structure are
stationary. While this SF method does not extract all information contained in
the light curves (i.e., the transfer function), it provides an intuitive
interpretation for the observed trends of AGN MIR SFs compared with optical
SFs.

stellar mass and rest-frame colors for AGN hosts. We find that (1) AGNs can
contribute significantly to the total optical light down to ${\rm log}\,L_{\rm

significantly bias the structural measurements; (2) AGN hosts are predominately
star-forming galaxies at ${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_\star \lesssim 11.3\ M_\odot$;
(3) the bulk of AGNs (64%) reside in galaxies with significant stellar disks,
while their host galaxies become increasingly bulge dominated and quiescent at
${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_\star \gtrsim 11.0\ M_\odot$; (4) the size-stellar mass
relation of AGN hosts tends to lie between that of inactive star-forming and
quiescent galaxies, suggesting that the physical mechanism responsible for
building the central stellar density also efficiently fuel the black hole
growth; (5) the hosts of X-ray unobscured AGNs are biased towards face-on
systems and the average $E(B-V)/N_{\rm H}$ is similar to the galactic
dust-to-gas ratio, suggesting that some of the obscuration of the nuclei could
come from galaxy-scale gas and dust, which may partly account for (up to 30%)
the deficiency of star-forming disks as host galaxies for the most massive
AGNs. These results are consistent with a scenario in which the black hole and

have been proposed to discover SHSs that generally require high run time on
large-scale networks. Another challenge is discovering SHSs across different
types of networks for which the traditional one-model-fit-all approach fails to

recent advancement of graph neural network approaches on various graph

large scale networks and diverse networks. We transform the problem into a

the network structure and node features to discover SHS nodes in large scale
networks, endeavouring to lessen the computational cost while maintaining high
accuracy. To effectively discover SHSs across diverse networks, we propose
another model Meta-GraphSHS based on meta-learning that learns generalizable
knowledge from diverse training graphs (instead of directly learning the model)
and utilizes the learned knowledge to create a customized model to identify
SHSs in each new graph. We theoretically show that the depth of the proposed
graph neural network model should be at least $\Omega(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$ to
accurately calculate the SHSs discovery problem. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed models through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world

malicious node may eavesdrop DIO messages of its neighbor nodes and later
replay the captured DIO many times with fixed intervals. In this paper, we
present and investigate one of the severe attacks named as a non-spoofed
copycat attack, a type of replay based DoS attack against RPL protocol. It is
shown that the non-spoofed copycat attack increases the average end-to-end

problem, an intrusion detection system (IDS) named CoSec-RPL is proposed in

federated unlearning algorithms require the server to store the history of the
parameter updates, which is not applicable in scenarios where the server
storage resource is constrained. In this paper, we propose a
simple-yet-effective subspace based federated unlearning method, dubbed SFU,
that lets the global model perform gradient ascent in the orthogonal space of
input gradient spaces formed by other clients to eliminate the target client's
contribution without requiring additional storage. Specifically, the server
first collects the gradients generated from the target client after performing
gradient ascent, and the input representation matrix is computed locally by the
remaining clients. We also design a differential privacy method to protect the
privacy of the representation matrix. Then the server merges those
representation matrices to get the input gradient subspace and updates the
global model in the orthogonal subspace of the input gradient subspace to
complete the forgetting task with minimal model performance degradation.
Experiments on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 show that SFU outperforms several

which reproduces the well-known spin-vorticity coupling. We also calculate
radiative correction to the gravitational form factors in quantum
electrodynamics plasma. We find two structures in the form factors contributing
to the scattering amplitude of fermion in vorticity field, one is from the
fermion self-energy correction, pointing to suppression of spin-vorticity
coupling in medium; the other structure comes from graviton-fermion vertex
correction, which does not adopt potential interpretation, but corresponds to
transition matrix element between initial and final states. Both structures
contribute to axial chiral vortical effect. The net effect is that radiative
correction enhances the axial chiral vortical effect. Our results clarify the
relation and difference between spin-vorticity coupling and axial chiral
vortical effect from the perspective of form factors. We also discuss the
application of the results in quantum chromodynamic plasma, indicating
radiative correction might have an appreciable effect in spin polarization
effect in heavy ion collisions.

been explored by means of magnetization, specific heat, electrical resistivity,
Hall coefficient, and thermoelectric power measurements. $R$Cd$_{0.67}$As$_2$
compounds indicate a (structural) phase transition at high temperatures,
accompanied by a remarkable increase of the electrical resistivity with an
extremely low carrier concentration. CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$ exhibits a large
magnetic anisotropy and an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order below $T_{N} = 4$~K.
Magnetic susceptibility curves, together with magnetization isotherms and
specific heat, are analyzed by the point charge model of crystalline electric
field (CEF). In the paramagnetic state, the observed magnetic properties can be
well explained by the CEF effects, implying that the 4$f$ moments remain
localized. Electrical resistivity measurements, together with Hall resistivity
and thermoelectric power, also suggest highly localized 4$f$ electrons, where
Kondo contributions are negligible. The low temperature physical properties
manifest strong magnetic field dependencies. For $H \perp c$, $T_{N}$ shifts to
lower temperature as magnetic field increases, and eventually disappears at
$H_{c} \sim 60$~ kOe. Inside the AFM state, three metamagnetic transitions are
clearly evidenced from the magnetization isotherms. The RKKY interaction may be
responsible for the AFM ordering in CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$, however it would have
to be mediated by extremely low charge carriers. Although the AFM ordering
temperature in CeCd$_{0.67}$As$_2$ can be continuously suppressed to zero, no
AFM quantum phase transition is expected due to the lack of conduction electron
clouds to screen the 4$f$ moments.

history of the Martian atmosphere and the origin of organic matter on Mars.
Photolysis of CO$_{2}$ is known to induce strong isotopic fractionation of
carbon between CO$_{2}$ and CO. However, its effect on the carbon isotopic
compositions in the Martian atmosphere remains uncertain. Here we develop a 1-D
photochemical model considering isotopic fractionation via photolysis of
CO$_{2}$ to estimate the vertical profiles of the carbon isotopic compositions
of CO and CO$_{2}$ in the Martian atmosphere. We find that CO is depleted in
$^{13}$C compared with CO$_{2}$ at each altitude due to the fractionation via
CO$_{2}$ photolysis: the minimum value of $\delta ^{13}$C in CO is about $-170$
per mil under the standard eddy diffusion setting. This result supports the
hypothesis that fractionated atmospheric CO is responsible for the production
of the $^{13}$C-depleted organic carbon in Martian sediments detected by
Curiosity Rover through the conversion of CO into organic materials and their
deposition on the surface. The photolysis and transport-induced fractionation
of CO we report here leads to a $\sim 15$ % decrease in the amount of inferred
atmospheric loss when combined with the present-day fractionation of the
atmosphere and previous studies of carbon escape to space. The fractionated
isotopic composition of CO in the Martian atmosphere may be observed by ExoMars
Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) and ground-based telescopes, and escaping ion species

GAN-inversion, using a pre-trained generator as a deep generative prior, is a

performance of GAN-inversion can be limited by a lack of robustness to unknown
gross corruptions, i.e., the restored image might easily deviate from the
ground truth. In this paper, we propose a Robust GAN-inversion (RGI) method
with a provable robustness guarantee to achieve image restoration under unknown

Moreover, we extend RGI to Relaxed-RGI (R-RGI) for generator fine-tuning to
mitigate the gap between the GAN learned manifold and the true image manifold

improves the image restoration and corrupted region mask identification

Abelian symmetries. It has been recently shown that general unitary
transformations that respect a global symmetry can not be realized by composing
unitaries that respect the same symmetry but do not act on all the subsystems
in the system. For a general symmetry group, such as SU(d), the locality of
interactions imposes different types of constraints on the realizable
unitaries. For instance, the unitary realized in a subspace with one
irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized
unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the
symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors rather than all unitaries that
respect the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic, or the
orthogonal subgroups of this group. We show that none of the aforementioned
restrictions appear in the case of Abelian symmetries: While the locality of
interactions still imposes additional constraints on the realizable unitaries,
they are of the following two types: (i) constraints on the relative phases
between subspaces with different charges, and (ii) constraints due to the
presence of multiple invariant subspaces inside a subspace with a given charge,
which results in extra conserved observables. The latter type of constraint can
be removed by k-local symmetric unitaries with sufficiently large k
(independent of the system size), whereas to remove the former constraints, in
general, one needs an ancillary qudit.

Riemannian geometry between $\mathcal{X}$ and the intermediate feature maps
$\mathcal{H}$ of the U-Nets to provide a deep understanding over the
geometrical structure of $\mathcal{X}$. The discovered semantic latent
directions mostly yield disentangled attribute changes, and they are globally
consistent across different samples. Furthermore, editing in earlier timesteps
edits coarse attributes, while ones in later timesteps focus on high-frequency
details. We define the curvedness of a line segment between samples to show
that $\mathcal{X}$ is a curved manifold. Experiments on different baselines and
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method even on Stable Diffusion.
Our source code will be publicly available for the future researchers.

mass ejection (CME) and confined ones without CME. To explore whether there are
pre-flare conditions in terms of magnetic energy and helicity that can
effectively determine the types of flares, here we analyzed a suite of related
parameters of the reconstructed pre-flare coronal magnetic field of major solar
flares, either eruptive or confined, from 2011 to 2017 near the solar disk
center. The investigated parameters include the extensive-type quantities such
as the total magnetic energy $E_T$, the potential energy $E_P$, the free energy
$E_F$, the relative helicity $H_R$, and the non-potential helicity $H_J$, as
well as the intensive-type indices $E_F/E_P$, $|H_J/H_R|$,
$|H_R/\phi^{\prime2}|$ and $|H_J/\phi^{\prime2}|$, where $\phi^{\prime}$ is
half of the total unsigned magnetic flux. We have the following key findings:
(1) None of the extensive parameters can effectively distinguish the eruptive
and confined potential of the pre-flare coronal fields, though the confined
events have averagely larger values; (2) All the intensive parameters have
significantly larger average and median values for eruptive flares than the
confined events, which indicates that the field for eruptive flares have
overall higher degree of non-potentiality and complexity than that of the
confined flares; (3) The energy ratio $E_F/E_P$ and the normalized
non-potential helicity $|H_J/\phi^{\prime2}|$, which are strongly correlated
with each other, have among the highest capability of distinguishing the fields
that possibly produce a major eruptive or confined flare, as over 75\% of all
the events are successfully discriminated between eruptive and confined flares
by using critical values of $E_F/E_P\ge0.27$ and
$|H_J/\phi^{\prime2}|\ge0.009$.

often to maintain clinical measures within a desirable range, rather than
maximizing or minimizing their values. To achieve this, it may be more
practical to recommend a therapeutic dose interval rather than a single dose
for a given patient. Since different patients may respond differently to the
same dosage of medication, the therapeutic dose interval needs to be
personalized based on each patient's unique characteristics. However, this
problem is challenging as it requires jointly learning the lower and upper
bound functions for personalized dose intervals. Currently, there are no
methods available that are suitable to address this challenge. To fill this
gap, we propose a novel loss function that converts the task of learning
personalized two-sided dose intervals into a risk minimization problem. The
loss function is defined over a tensor product reproducing kernel Hilbert space
and is doubly-robust to misspecification of nuisance functions. We establish
statistical properties of estimated dose interval functions that directly
minimize the empirical risk associated with the loss function. Our simulation
and a real-world application of personalized warfarin dose intervals show that
our proposed direct estimation method outperforms naive indirect
regression-based methods.

  Weights?",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a robust model trained to be resilient to one or multiple types of
distribution shifts (e.g., natural image corruptions), how is that ""robustness""
encoded in the model weights, and how easily can it be disentangled and/or
""zero-shot"" transferred to some other models? This paper empirically suggests a
surprisingly simple answer: linearly - by straightforward model weight
arithmetic! We start by drawing several key observations: (1)assuming that we
train the same model architecture on both a clean dataset and its corrupted
version, resultant weights mostly differ in shallow layers; (2)the weight
difference after projection, which we call ""Robust Weight Signature"" (RWS),
appears to be discriminative and indicative of different corruption types;
(3)for the same corruption type, the RWSs obtained by one model architecture
are highly consistent and transferable across different datasets.
  We propose a minimalistic model robustness ""patching"" framework that carries
a model trained on clean data together with its pre-extracted RWSs. In this
way, injecting certain robustness to the model is reduced to directly adding
the corresponding RWS to its weight. We verify our proposed framework to be
remarkably (1)lightweight. since RWSs concentrate on the shallowest few layers
and we further show they can be painlessly quantized, storing an RWS is up to
13 x more compact than storing the full weight copy; (2)in-situ adjustable.
RWSs can be appended as needed and later taken off to restore the intact clean
model. We further demonstrate one can linearly re-scale the RWS to control the
patched robustness strength; (3)composable. Multiple RWSs can be added
simultaneously to patch more comprehensive robustness at once; and
(4)transferable. Even when the clean model backbone is continually adapted or
updated, RWSs remain as effective patches due to their outstanding
cross-dataset transferability.

state of the system, is provided by a Lie-algebraic result that guarantees
state-to-state controllability of this system for an arbitrary choice of
initial- and final states that are invariant with respect to permutations of
qubits. This scheme is envisaged in the form of a pulse sequence that involves
three instantaneous control pulses, which are equivalent to global qubit
rotations, and two Ising-interaction pulses of finite durations between
consecutive control pulses. The design of this pulse sequence -- whose total
duration is $T\approx 0.95\:\hbar/J$, where $J$ is the Ising-coupling strength

demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed state-preparation scheme by
carrying out a detailed numerical analysis of its robustness to systematic
errors, i.e. deviations from the optimal values of the eight parameters that
characterize the underlying pulse sequence. Finally, we discuss how our
proposed scheme can be generalized for engineering Dicke states in systems with

strain-driven topological phonon phase transition in hexagonal TiO can severely
diminish its lattice thermal conductivity (\k{appa}L), with a 78% reduction in
\k{appa}L at room temperature. This significant suppression of \k{appa}L is
found to be a consequence of increased phonon scattering rates, originating
largely from the enlarged three-phonon scattering phase space of heat-carrying
acoustic phonons. This is enabled by the breaking of symmetry protected
degeneracy of phonon branches, which makes phonon-phonon scattering selection
rules easier to satisfy. Our work provides direct evidence for the importance
of band topology of phonons in tuning thermal conductivity of topological

autonomous systems at the edge for achieving high performance given the

controllers designed with formal guarantees on safety that precede in priority
such optimizations, which in turn limits their application in real settings. In
this paper, we propose a novel energy optimization framework that is aware of
the autonomous system's safety state, and leverages it to regulate the
application of energy optimization methods so that the system's formal safety
properties are preserved. In particular, through the formal characterization of
a system's safety state as a dynamic processing deadline, the computing
workloads of the underlying models can be adapted accordingly. For our
experiments, we model two popular runtime energy optimization methods,
offloading and gating, and simulate an autonomous driving system (ADS) use-case
in the CARLA simulation environment with performance characterizations obtained
from the standard Nvidia Drive PX2 ADS platform. Our results demonstrate that
through a formal awareness of the perceived risks in the test case scenario,
energy efficiency gains are still achieved (reaching 89.9%) while maintaining
the desired safety properties.

airfoil using a synthetic jet (SJ). A large-eddy simulation (LES) was performed
for a leading-edge separation flow around a NACA0015 airfoil at the chord
Reynolds number of $63,000$ and the angle of attack of $12^\circ$. The present
LES resolves a turbulent structure inside a deforming SJ cavity by a
sixth-order compact difference scheme with a deforming grid. An optimal
actuation-frequency band is identified between $F^+=6.0$ and $20$ (normalised
by the chord length and the freestream velocity), which suppresses the
separation and drastically improves the lift-to-drag ratio. It was found that
in the controlled flows, the laminar separation bubble near the leading edge
periodically releases multiple spanwise-uniform vortex structures, which
diffuse and merge to generate a single coherent vortex in the period of $F^+$.
Such a coherent vortex plays a significant role in exchanging a chordwise
momentum between a near-wall surface and the freestream away from the wall. It
also entrains smaller turbulent vortices and eventually enhances the turbulent
component of the Reynolds stress throughout the suction surface. Linear
stability theory (LST) was subsequently compared with the LES result, which
clarifies the limitations and applicability of the LST to controlled flows with
the present SJ condition. It is also revealed that in the optimal $F^+$ regime,
both linear and nonlinear modes are excited in a well-balanced manner, where
the first mode is associated with the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and
contributes to a quick and smooth turbulent transition, while the second mode
shows a frequency lower than that of the linear mode and encourages a formation
of the coherent vortex structure that eventually entrains smaller turbulent
vortices.

indefiniteness which limits its applications on kernel-dependent algorithmic

Sobolev transport for measures on a graph having the same total mass by

it is also negative definite. Additionally, we derive geometric structures for
the UST and establish relations between our UST and other transport distances.
We further exploit the negative definiteness to design positive definite

and/or Doppler beaming. Aims. The analysis of these light variations can be
used to derive the mass and radius of the companion and hence determine its
nature. Thereby we assume the most probable sdB mass and the radius of the sdB
derived by the fit of the spectral energy distribution and the Gaia parallax.
In the high signal-to-noise space-based light curves from the Transiting
Exoplanet Survey Satellite and the K2 space mission, several reflection effect
binaries and ellipsoidal modulation binaries have been observed with much
better quality than possible for ground-based observations. The high quality of
the light curves allowed us to analyse a large sample of sdB binaries with M
dwarf or white dwarf companions using lcurve. For the first time we can
constrain the absolute parameters of 19 companions of reflection effect systems
covering periods from 2.5 to 19 hours and companion masses from the hydrogen
burning limit to early M dwarfs. Moreover, we could determine the mass of eight
white dwarf companion to hot subdwarf binaries showing ellipsoidal modulations,
covering a so far unexplored period range from 7 to 19 hours. The derived
masses of the white dwarf companions show that all but two of the white dwarf
companions are most likely helium-core white dwarfs. Combining our results with
previously measured rotation velocities allowed us to derive the rotation
period of seven sdBs in short-period binaries. In four of those systems the
rotation period of the sdB agrees with a tidally locked orbit, in the other

Epidemiological studies have shown the significant health benefits associated
to the consumption of lycopene rich foods, because of the anti-cancer
properties. Degradative losses of lycopene during processing is a grave
concern, hence encapsulation provides a remedy. The objective of this study is
to evaluate the encapsulation efficiency of two biodegradable polymers (PLGA
and PCL) as for controlled release of lycopene in the gastrointestinal (GI)
system. The nanoparticles (NP) were synthesized by emulsion evaporation method
and physicochemical properties was determined using a Dynamic Light Scattering
spectroscopy. The results show the hydrodynamic diameter of the lycopene NP
synthesized in PCL (200 mg) and 3500 mg surfactant and sonicated for 15 min was
79.23+0.85 nm (Lowest). PLGA (500 mg) and 500 mg surfactant with 15 min
sonication was observed to have the lowest NP diameter (108.2+2.66 nm) among
the others. Significant difference result found in PDI value (0.12+0.07) when
PCL of 200mg dissolve in 3500 mg of surfactant. On the other hands the zeta
potential values were much smaller in case of PCL NP ranged between -1.3+0.046
and -4.21+0.08 mV compared to the PLGA NP -72.36+2.17 to 107.66+3.15 mV in all
experiments. Thus, NP synthesized with PCL and surfactant provide a smaller
sized nano-solution than PLGA and surfactant. As the degradation rate for PCL
is lower than PLGA so PCL can be considered as a potential biodegradable
polymer than PLGA to encapsulate lycopene.

have developed adaptive communication strategies to reduce communication

agents that are beyond the communication range. In this paper, we consider a
realistic communication model where each agent has a limited communication
range, and the communication topology dynamically changes. To facilitate
effective agent communication, we propose a novel communication protocol called
Adaptively Controlled Two-Hop Communication (AC2C). After an initial local
communication round, AC2C employs an adaptive two-hop communication strategy to
enable long-range information exchange among agents to boost performance, which
is implemented by a communication controller. This controller determines
whether each agent should ask for two-hop messages and thus helps to reduce the
communication overhead during distributed execution. We evaluate AC2C on three
cooperative multi-agent tasks, and the experimental results show that it
outperforms relevant baselines with lower communication costs.

Primo features write-conflict-free concurrency control that guarantees once a
transaction enters the commit phase, no concurrency conflict (e.g., deadlock)
would occur when installing the write-set -- hence the prepare phase is no
longer needed to account for any potential conflict from any partition. In
addition, Primo further optimizes the transaction path using asynchronous group
commit. With that, the durability delay is also taken off the transaction's

Primo attains 1.42x to 8.25x higher throughput than state-of-the-art general

response, where one analyzes the shift in customers' (agents') usage patterns

of incentives on the probabilities of accepting such offers in a real-world

depicts the probability of an agent reducing its load as a function of the
discounts offered to them. We call it reduction probability (RP). RP function
is further parametrized by the rate of reduction (RR), which can differ for
each agent. We provide an optimal algorithm, MJS--ExpResponse, that outputs the
discounts to each agent by maximizing the expected reduction under a budget
constraint. When RRs are unknown, we propose a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) based

show that it exhibits sublinear regret. Finally, we showcase the efficacy of
the proposed algorithm in mitigating demand peaks in a real-world smart grid

reactions can originate from co-operativity, whose physical interactions should
also affect diffusion. We here take direct interactions into account and show
that they strongly affect Turing patterns. We find that weak repulsion between
the activator and inhibitor can substantially lower the required differential
diffusivity and reaction non-linearity. In contrast, strong interactions can
induce phase separation, but the resulting length scale is still typically
governed by the fundamental reaction-diffusion length scale. Taken together,
our theory connects traditional Turing patterns with chemically active phase
separation, thus describing a wider range of systems. Moreover, we demonstrate
that even weak interactions affect patterns substantially, so they should be

supernova (SN) explosion is still a matter of debate, in major part because of
the ambiguity among light-curve powering mechanisms. When stars explode as SNe,
the light-curve luminosity is typically sustained by a central engine
(radioactive decay, magnetar spin-down, or fallback accretion). However, since
massive stars eject considerable amounts of material during their evolution,
there may be a significant contribution coming from interactions with the
previously ejected circumstellar medium (CSM). Reconstructing the progenitor
configuration at the time of explosion requires a detailed analysis of the
long-term photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the related transient. In
this paper, we present the results of our follow-up campaign of SN 2020faa.
Given the high luminosity and peculiar slow light curve, it is purported to
have a massive progenitor. We present the spectro-photometric dataset and
investigate different options to explain the unusual observed properties that
support this assumption. We computed the bolometric luminosity of the supernova
and the evolution of its temperature, radius, and expansion velocity. We also
fit the observed light curve with a multi-component model to infer information
on the progenitor and the explosion mechanism. Reasonable parameters are
inferred for SN 2020faa with a magnetar of energy Ep=1.5(+0.5,-0.2)x10^50 erg

addition, we need an extra source to power the luminosity of the second peak.

is a viable mechanism for supplying the required energy to achieve this effect.

  Our classification is based on the Sturm meanders, which arise from a

$u_t=0$. Specifically, we address meanders with only three ""noses"", each of
which is innermost to a nested family of upper or lower meander arcs. The
Chafee-Infante paradigm, with cubic nonlinearity $f=f(u)$, features just two

  Our results on the gradient-like global PDE dynamics include a precise
description of the connection graphs. The edges denote PDE heteroclinic orbits
$v_1 \leadsto v_2$ between equilibrium vertices $v_1, v_2$ of adjacent Morse

the closure of the unstable manifold $W^u(\mathcal{O})$ of the unique
equilibrium with maximal Morse index $d$. Surprisingly, for parabolic PDEs
based on irreversible diffusion, the connection graph exhibits time
reversibility on the ($d$-1)-sphere boundary of the global attractor.

pose-controllable 3D facial animation synthesis method is proposed by utilizing
hierarchical audio-vertex attention. To synthesize real and detailed
expression, a hierarchical decomposition strategy is proposed to encode the
audio signal into both a global latent feature and a local vertex-wise control
feature. Then the local and global audio features combined with vertex spatial
features are used to predict the final consistent facial animation via a graph
convolutional neural network by fusing the intrinsic spatial topology structure
of the face model and the corresponding semantic feature of the audio. To
accomplish pose-controllable animation, we introduce a novel pose attribute
augmentation method by utilizing the 2D talking face technique. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed method can produce more realistic facial
expressions and head posture movements. Qualitative and quantitative
experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance

answer the question: `why do target networks stabilise TD learning'? To do so,
we formalise the notion of a partially fitted policy evaluation method, which
describes the use of target networks and bridges the gap between fitted methods
and semigradient temporal difference algorithms. Using this framework we are
able to uniquely characterise the so-called deadly triad - the use of TD
updates with (nonlinear) function approximation and off-policy data - which
often leads to nonconvergent algorithms. This insight leads us to conclude that
the use of target networks can mitigate the effects of poor conditioning in the
Jacobian of the TD update. Instead, we show that under mild regularity
conditions and a well tuned target network update frequency, convergence can be
guaranteed even in the extremely challenging off-policy sampling and nonlinear

accuracy, has improved remarkably over the past several years, especially with
the advent of deep learning. However, even the most accurate NNs can be biased
toward a specific output classification due to the inherent bias in the
available training datasets, which may propagate to the real-world
implementations. This paper deals with the robustness bias, i.e., the bias
exhibited by the trained NN by having a significantly large robustness to noise
for a certain output class, as compared to the remaining output classes. The
bias is shown to result from imbalanced datasets, i.e., the datasets where all
output classes are not equally represented. Towards this, we propose the
UnbiasedNets framework, which leverages K-means clustering and the NN's noise
tolerance to diversify the given training dataset, even from relatively smaller
datasets. This generates balanced datasets and reduces the bias within the
datasets themselves. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework
catering to the robustness bias problem in NNs. We use real-world datasets to
demonstrate the efficacy of the UnbiasedNets for data diversification, in case
of both binary and multi-label classifiers. The results are compared to
well-known tools aimed at generating balanced datasets, and illustrate how
existing works have limited success while addressing the robustness bias. In
contrast, UnbiasedNets provides a notable improvement over existing works,
while even reducing the robustness bias significantly in some cases, as
observed by comparing the NNs trained on the diversified and original datasets.

encode conditional independence. In graphical modeling of multivariate
stochastic processes, graphs may encode so-called local independence
analogously. If some coordinate processes of the multivariate stochastic
process are unobserved, the local independence graph of the observed coordinate
processes is a directed mixed graph (DMG). Two DMGs may encode the same local
independences in which case we say that they are Markov equivalent.
  Markov equivalence is a central notion in graphical modeling. We show that
deciding Markov equivalence of DMGs is coNP-complete, even under a sparsity
assumption. As a remedy, we introduce a collection of equivalence relations on
DMGs that are all less granular than Markov equivalence and we say that they
are weak equivalence relations. This leads to feasible algorithms for naturally
occurring computational problems related to weak equivalence of DMGs. The
equivalence classes of a weak equivalence relation have attractive properties.
In particular, each equivalence class has a greatest element which leads to a
concise representation of an equivalence class. Moreover, these equivalence
relations define a hierarchy of granularity in the graphical modeling which
leads to simple and interpretable connections between equivalence relations
corresponding to different levels of granularity.

geometrodynamics is that time appears in semiclassical limit. Following this
line of thinking, one can come to the Schrodinger equation for matter fields in
curved spacetime with quantum-gravitational corrections. In the present paper,
we study the semiclassical limit in the case of a closed isotropic model with a
scalar field decomposed into modes. We analyse calculations made within
frameworks of three approaches. The first approach was proposed by Kiefer and
Singh. Since the Wheeler - DeWitt equation does not contain a time derivative,
it is constructed by means of a special mathematical procedure, time variable
being a parameter along a classical trajectory of gravitational field. The
second method was suggested in the paper of Maniccia and Montani who introduced
the Kuchar - Torre reference fluid as an origin of time. And the third is the
extended phase space approach to quantization of gravity. In this approach, the
temporal Schrodinger equation is argued to be more fundamental than the Wheeler

fixing of a reference frame of some observer, who can register macroscopic

go to the semiclassical limit, the Born - Oppenheimer approximation for gravity

re-accretions of several parent bodies in this disk, and that they are all
characterized by a low material cohesion, Hesselbrock & Milton (2017) have
showed that a recycling process may happen during the assembling of Phobos, by
which Phobos' parents are destroyed into a Roche-interior ring and reaccreted
several times. In the current paper we explore in details the recycling model,
and pay particular attention to the characteristics of the disk using 1D models
of disk/satellite interactions. In agreement with previous studies we confirm
that, if Phobos' parents bodies are gravitational aggregates (rubble piles),
then the recycling process does occur. However, Phobos should be accompanied
today by a Roche-interior ring. Furthermore, the characteristics of the ring
are not reconcilable with today`s observations of Mars' environment, which put
stringent constraints on the existence of a ring around Mars. The recycling
mechanism may or may not have occurred at the Roche limit for an old moon
population, depending on their internal cohesion. However, the Phobos we see
today cannot be the outcome of such a recycling process.

symmetry conditions that require monolayer structures or specific material
engineering, non-resonant optical control to avoid energy dissipation, and the
ability to switch valley polarization at optical speed. We demonstrate
all-optical and non-resonant control over valley polarization using bulk
MoS$_2$, a centrosymmetric material with zero Berry curvature at the valleys.
Our universal method utilizes spin-angular momentum-shaped tri-foil optical
control pulses to switch the material's electronic topology to induce valley
polarization by transiently breaking time and space inversion symmetry through
a simple phase rotation. The dependence of the generation of the second
harmonic of an optical probe pulse on the phase rotation directly demonstrates
the efficacy of valley polarization. It shows that direct optical control over
the valley degree of freedom is not limited to monolayer structures. Instead,
it is possible for systems with an arbitrary number of layers and bulk
materials. Universal and non-resonant valley control at optical speeds unlocks
the possibility of engineering efficient, multi-material valleytronic devices

the increased flux during flare events can trigger the chemical reactions that

sufficiently strong flares may erode exoplanets' atmospheres and reduce their
UV protection. Recent observations of flares have shown that the flaring flux

propose a post-processing method based on a graph convolutional neural network
(GCN) to refine inaccurate segmentation parts and improve the overall
segmentation accuracy. Firstly, nnUNet is used as an initial segmentation
framework, and the uncertainty in the segmentation results is analyzed.
Certainty and uncertainty nodes establish the nodes of a graph neural network.
Each node and its 6 neighbors form an edge, and 32 nodes are randomly selected
for uncertain nodes to form edges. The highly uncertain nodes are taken as the
subsequent refinement targets. Secondly, the nnUNet result of the certainty
nodes is used as label to form a semi-supervised graph network problem, and the
uncertainty part is optimized through training the GCN network to improve the
segmentation performance. This describes our proposed nnUNet-GCN segmentation
framework. We perform tumor segmentation experiments on the PET/CT dataset in
the MICCIA2022 autoPET challenge. Among them, 30 cases are randomly selected
for testing, and the experimental results show that the false positive rate is
effectively reduced with nnUNet-GCN refinement. In quantitative analysis, there
is an improvement of 2.12 % on the average Dice score, 6.34 on 95 % Hausdorff

first time, we go beyond the heuristic derivation of deformed Heisenberg
algebra, and explicitly derive it using a model of discrete spacetime, which
will be motivated by quantum gravity. We first investigate the effects of
leading order Planckian lattice corrections, and demonstrate that they exactly
match those suggested by the heuristic arguments used in quantum gravity
phenomenology. However, as will rigorously obtain deformations from higher
order Planckian lattice corrections. Unlike the leading order corrections,
these higher order corrections will be model dependent. We will choose a
specific model, which will break the rotational symmetry, as it is important to
produce such effects as CMB anisotropies are thought to be related quantum
gravitational effects. We will propose based on the mathematical similarity of
the Planckian lattice used here with graphene, that graphene can be used as an
analogue system to study quantum gravity. Finally, we investigate the
deformation of the covariant form of the Heisenberg algebra using a four
dimensional Euclidean lattice.

exciting possibility for current and future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors.
However, distinguishing it from other stochastic processes, such as
instrumental noise and astrophysical backgrounds, is challenging. It is even
more delicate for the space-based GW observatory LISA since it cannot correlate
its observations with other detectors, unlike today's terrestrial network.
Nonetheless, with multiple measurements across the constellation and high
accuracy in the noise level, detection is still possible. In the context of GW
background detection, previous studies have assumed that instrumental noise has
a known, possibly parameterized, spectral shape. To make our analysis robust
against imperfect knowledge of the instrumental noise, we challenge this
crucial assumption and assume that the single-link interferometric noises have
an arbitrary and unknown spectrum. We investigate possible ways of separating
instrumental and GW contributions by using realistic LISA data simulations with
time-varying arms and second-generation time-delay interferometry. By fitting a
generic spline model to the interferometer noise and a power-law template to
the signal, we can detect GW stochastic backgrounds up to energy density levels
comparable with fixed-shape models. We also demonstrate that we can probe a
region of the GW background parameter space that today's detectors cannot
access.

reconstruct the areal densities of each isotope and pixel. Both components are
based on the inversion of a forward model that accounts for the highly

while also modeling the substantial spatio-temporal variation of the background

obstructed by the risk of violating data privacy, impeding research in fields
like healthcare. Synthetic data is a potential solution. It aims to generate
data that has the same distribution as the original data, but that does not
disclose information about individuals. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are
a common privacy attack, in which the attacker attempts to determine whether a
particular real sample was used for training of the model. Previous works that
propose MIAs against generative models either display low performance -- giving
the false impression that data is highly private -- or need to assume access to
internal generative model parameters -- a relatively low-risk scenario, as the
data publisher often only releases synthetic data, not the model. In this work
we argue for a realistic MIA setting that assumes the attacker has some
knowledge of the underlying data distribution. We propose DOMIAS, a
density-based MIA model that aims to infer membership by targeting local
overfitting of the generative model. Experimentally we show that DOMIAS is
significantly more successful at MIA than previous work, especially at
attacking uncommon samples. The latter is disconcerting since these samples may
correspond to underrepresented groups. We also demonstrate how DOMIAS' MIA
performance score provides an interpretable metric for privacy, giving data
publishers a new tool for achieving the desired privacy-utility trade-off in
their synthetic data.

optimization of a macrostructure undergoing ductile failure. The prediction of
ductile solid materials which exhibit dominant plastic deformation is an
intriguingly challenging task and plays an extremely important role in various
engineering applications. Here, we rely on the phase-field approach to fracture
which is a widely adopted framework for modeling and computing the fracture
failure phenomena in solids. The first objective is to optimize the topology of
the structure in order to minimize its mass, while accounting for structural
damage. To do so, the topological phase transition function (between solid and
void phases) is introduced, thus resulting in an extension of all the governing
equations. Our second objective is to additionally enhance the fracture
resistance of the structure. Accordingly, two different formulations are
proposed. One requires only the residual force vector of the deformation field
as a constraint, while in the second formulation, the residual force vector of
the deformation and phase-field fracture simultaneously have been imposed. An
incremental minimization principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative
materials are used to derive the governing equations. Here, the level-set-based
topology optimization is employed to seek an optimal layout with smooth and

assessment-planning we aim to find a high-level assessment plan which the UAV

network biased towards one modality. Hence, the generalization of such models
becomes a significant problem where the non-dominant input modality during

introduce a novel training setup with regularizer in the multimodal

Specifically, our regularizer term helps to make the feature fusion method more
robust by considering both the feature extractors equivalently important during
the training to extract the multimodal distribution which is referred to as
removing the imbalance problem. Furthermore, our decoupling concept of output

The wide range of confined cavity modes that we detect arise from carefully

Anderson localized states spectrally located at the PBG edges with relatively
high quality factors. In this work, by engineering the structural parameters of
the cavity, we achieve an experimental quality factor of order 6000 (higher
than the one of the Anderson states) and we demonstrate that three types of
localized modes of different nature coexist within a small area and in a
relatively narrow spectral window of the disordered correlated system. Their
compatibility with general boundary constraints, in contrast with ordered
architectures that suffer strict layout constraints imposed by photonic
crystals' axes orientation, makes optical cavities in disordered hyperuniform
patterns a flexible optical insulator platform for planar optical circuits.

changed and unchanged building parts, (3) train a random forest machine
learning model with VLS data based on object-specific change features, and (4)
use the classifier to assess building damage in real-world point clouds from
photogrammetry-based dense image matching (DIM). We evaluate classifiers
trained on different input data with respect to their capacity to classify
three damage grades (heavy, extreme, destruction) in pre- and post-event DIM
point clouds of a real earthquake event. Our approach is transferable with
respect to multi-source input point clouds used for training (VLS) and

of the model by training it on simulated data of geometric change which
characterises relevant damage grades across different geographic regions. The
model yields high multi-target classification accuracies (overall accuracy:
92.0% - 95.1%). Its performance improves only slightly when using real-world
region-specific training data (< 3% higher overall accuracies) and when using

of fields including engineering and machine learning. Especially, many problems
in these fields can be reduced to finding the minimum or maximum eigenvalue of
GEPs. One of the key problems to handle GEPs is that the memory usage and
computational complexity explode as the system of interest grows. This paper
aims at extending sequential quantum optimizers for GEPs. Sequential quantum
optimizers are a family of algorithms that iteratively solve the analytical
optimization of single-qubit gates in a coordinate descent manner. The
contribution of this paper is as follows. First, we formulate the GEP as the
minimization/maximization problem of the fractional form of the expectations of
two Hermitians. We then showed that the fractional objective function can be
analytically minimized or maximized with respect to a single-qubit gate by
solving a GEP of a 4 x 4 matrix. Second, we show that a system of linear
equations (SLE) characterized by a positive-definite Hermitian can be
formulated as a GEP and thus be attacked using the proposed method.
  Finally, we demonstrate two applications to important engineering problems
formulated with the finite element method. Through the demonstration, we have
the following bonus finding; a problem having a real-valued solution can be
solved more effectively using quantum gates generating a complex-valued state

continuous-time environments with delays. Such environments are characterized
by two distinctive features: firstly, the state x(t) is observed at irregular
time intervals, and secondly, the current action a(t) only affects the future
state x(t + g) with an unknown delay g > 0. A prime example of such an
environment is satellite control where the communication link between earth and
a satellite causes irregular observations and delays. Existing offline RL
algorithms have achieved success in environments with irregularly observed
states in time or known delays. However, environments involving both irregular
observations in time and unknown delays remains an open and challenging
problem. To this end, we propose Neural Laplace Control, a continuous-time
model-based offline RL method that combines a Neural Laplace dynamics model
with a model predictive control (MPC) planner--and is able to learn from an
offline dataset sampled with irregular time intervals from an environment that
has a inherent unknown constant delay. We show experimentally on
continuous-time delayed environments it is able to achieve near expert policy
performance.

optoelectronic and photocathodic device applications. However, in most of the
compounds belonging to this family, there has been less effort put into
investigating the mechanical properties and topological phase transitions (TPT)
of the compounds. Here, in the framework of density functional theory, the
mechanical properties and topological phase transition of NaLi$_{2}$Bi under
hydrostatic pressures are investigated. Elastic constants and phonon
calculations have shown the mechanical and dynamical stability of this compound
under hydrostatic tension and compression. The analysis of the elastic
constants shows that the NaLi$_{2}$Bi in the equilibrium state is an auxetic
material with a negative Poisson's ratio of -0.285, which changes to a material
with a positive Poisson's ratio under hydrostatic tension. Meanwhile, Poisson's
ratio and Pugh ratio indicate that this compound has brittle behavior and
maintains it under hydrostatic pressures. The calculated results of the band
structure within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) (Tran-Blaha
modified Becke-Johnson exchange potential approximation (TB-mBJ)) show that
NaLi$_{2}$Bi is a nontrivial topological material (trivial topological
material). It was found that hydrostatic compression (tension) in the GGA
(TB-mBJ) approach leads to a transition from a nontrivial (trivial) to a
trivial (nontrivial) topological phase for this compound. Moreover, the
calculated Wannier charge centers confirm the TPT. Identifying the mechanisms
controlling the auxetic behavior and TPT of this compound offers a valuable
feature for designing and developing high-performance nanoscale
electromechanical and spintronic devices.

of established or removed Showers were generated using an empirical evaluation
of their impact on the registered showers. The correctness of the parameters of
each stream included in the SD was checked by comparing them with the values
given in the source publications. We developed a set of criteria for nominating
showers to be established. We objectified rules for the temporary and permanent
removal of meteor showers from the Working list. Both of our proposed new

2022. We verified more than $1350$ data records of the MDC SD and introduced
$\sim$1700 corrections. We included new parameters for shower characterisation.
As a result of our verification procedure, 117 showers have been moved to the
List of removed showers. As of October 2022, the SD contains 923 showers, 110
of which are in the List of established Showers and 813 are in the Working

with those of the Planck mass ($M_P \sim10^{-5}$g) featuring in any theory of
quantum gravity. In particular, the Compton-Schwarzschild correspondence posits
a smooth transition between the Compton wavelength ($R_C \propto 1/M$) below
the Planck mass and the Schwarzschild radius ($R_{\rm S} \propto M$) above it.
The duality between $R_{\rm C}$ and $R_{\rm S}$ implies a form of the
Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) and suggests that elementary particles
may be sub-Planckian black holes. The simplest possibility is that the ADM mass
has the form $M + \beta M_P^2/M$ for some constant $\beta$ and this model can
be extended to charged and rotating black holes, clearly relevant to elementary
particles. Another possibility is that sub-Planckian black holes may arise in
loop quantum gravity and this explicitly links black holes and elementary
particles. Higher dimensions may modify both proposals. If there are $n$ extra
dimensions, all with the same compactification scale, one expects $R_{\rm S}
\propto M^{1/(1+n)}$ below this scale but $R_{\rm C}$ depends on the form of
the higher-dimensional wave-function. If it is spherically symmetric, then
$R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1}$, so duality is broken and the Planck mass is
reduced, allowing the possibility of TeV quantum gravity. If the wave-function
is pancaked in the extra dimensions, $R_{\rm C} \propto M^{-1/(1+n)}$ and so
duality is preserved but the Planck mass is unchanged.

utilizing the powerful priors from the pre-trained multi-modal model and grasp

relived without additional data for transfer. A series of experiments carried
out in simulation and real world indicate that our method can achieve better

To complicate matters further, recent research has analyzed the rough behavior
of volatility time series to challenge the common assumption that the
volatility process is a Brownian semimartingale. In order to tackle the arising
inferential task efficiently in this setting, we use the fact that a fractional
Brownian motion can be represented as a superposition of Markovian
semimartingales (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes) and we solve the filtering (and
parameter estimation) problem by resorting to more standard techniques, such as
particle methods.

quantum state allows a measurement machine to be constructed, which yields
Born's rule when measuring that particular state. This resolves the paradox and
is in agreement with the recent result of objective collapse models necessarily

order to enhance the performance of the wireless systems. However, from a
cellular service provider's point of view, a concern with the use of an IRS is
its effect on out-of-band (OOB) quality of service. Specifically, if there are
two operators, say X and Y, providing services in a given geographical area
using non-overlapping frequency bands, and if operator X uses an IRS to
optimally enhance the throughput of it's users, does the IRS degrade the
performance of operator Y? We study this scenario by analyzing the ergodic
sum-rates achieved by both the operators under round-robin scheduling. We also
derive the complementary cumulative distribution function of the change in the
effective channel gain at an OOB user with and without the IRS, which provides
deeper insights into the effect of the IRS on the overall channel quality.
Surprisingly, we find that even though the IRS is randomly configured from
operator Y's point of view, the OOB operator still benefits from the presence
of the IRS, witnessing a performance enhancement for free. This happens because
the IRS introduces additional paths between the transmitter and receiver,
increasing the overall signal power arriving at the receiver and providing
diversity benefits. We verify our findings via numerical simulations, and
conclude that an IRS is always beneficial to every operator, even when the IRS
is deployed to optimally serve only one operator in the system.

two major challenges remain outstanding: i) discovery of predictive patterns

and ii) association of individual temporal patterns to the target label
distribution that best characterizes the underlying clinical progression. To
address such challenges, we develop a novel temporal clustering method,
T-Phenotype, to discover phenotypes of predictive temporal patterns from

approach in frequency domain that can encode variable-length,
irregularly-sampled time-series into a unified representation space, which is
then applied to identify various temporal patterns that potentially contribute
to the target label using a new notion of path-based similarity. Throughout the

decomposition with interpolation (PODI) method for Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) -- Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations. The main novelties of the
proposed approach rely in (i) the combination of ROM and FV methods, (ii) a
numerical sensitivity analysis of the ROM accuracy with respect to the number
of POD modes and to the cardinality of the training set and (iii) a parametric
study with respect to the Stokes number. We test our ROM on the fluidized bed
benchmark problem. The accuracy of the ROM is assessed against results obtained
with the FOM both for Eulerian (the fluid volume fraction) and Lagrangian
(position and velocity of the particles) quantities. We also discuss the
efficiency of our ROM approach.

emphasised the need for confidence sets of models: an enumeration of those

penalised regression procedures, effective for prediction but potentially
misleading for subject-matter understanding. The proposed construction of such
sets relied on preliminary reduction of the full set of variables, and while
various possibilities could be considered for this, [9] proposed a succession
of regression fits based on incomplete block designs. The purpose of the
present paper is to provide insight on both aspects of that work. For an
unspecified reduction strategy, we begin by characterising models that are
likely to be retained in the model confidence set, emphasising geometric

reduction of [9]. We identify features of the covariate matrix that may reduce
its efficacy, and indicate improvements to the original proposal. An advantage
of the approach is its ability to reveal its own stability or fragility for the

restricted to a wall distance less than twice the laminar flame thickness. In

mixture fraction and curvature, are negatively correlated, which is in

or black hole binaries, where the outer accretion flow blocks a direct view of
the central source. The weak observed X-ray emission is instead produced mainly
by scattering of the intrinsic radiation from highly ionised gas surrounding
the source, the ADC. However, the origin of this scattering material is still
under debate. We use the ADC source 2S 0921-630 (V395 Car) to test whether it
is consistent with a thermal-radiative wind produced by the central X-ray
source illuminating and puffing up the outer disc. This wind is clearly visible
in blueshifted absorption lines in less highly inclined systems, where the
source is seen directly through this material. Using the phenomenological
photoionised plasma model, we first characterise the parameter that drives
emission lines observed in 2S0921 in XMM-Newton and Chandra data. Following
this, we run the Monte Carlo radiation transfer simulation to get
scattered/reprocessed emissions in the wind, with the density and velocity
structure obtained from the previous work. Our model agrees with all the wind
emission lines in the Chandra high and medium energy grating spectra for an
intrinsic source luminosity of L > 0.2 LEdd. This result strongly favours
thermal-radiative winds as the origin of the ADC. We also show how
high-resolution spectra via microcalorimeters can provide a definitive test by
detecting blueshifted absorption lines.

the motion of a marble on such a surface does not truly represent a orbital
trajectory under Newtonian gravity in a strict theoretical sense, but through a
proposed projection procedure, the experimentally recorded trajectories closely

with trip dispatching or choose to reject a charging trip order considering the
additional fees, contrary to the commonly assumed fleet autonomy, the proposed
method designs an incentivisation scheme (charging discounts) to encourage
driver compliance so that the planned charging trips and the associated profit
can be realised.

in a current trial is an expanding field in the era of precision medicine,
where trials are often performed in small patient cohorts for practical or

proposed. Even though these methods are mainly based on Bayesian approaches by
incorporating external information into the prior for the current analysis,
frequentist operating characteristics of the analysis strategy are of interest.
In particular, type I error and power at a prespecified point alternative are
in the focus. It is well-known that borrowing from external information may
lead to the alteration of type I error rate. We propose a procedure to
investigate and report the frequentist operating characteristics in this
context. The approach evaluates type I error rate of the test with borrowing
from external data and calibrates the test without borrowing to this type I
error rate. On this basis, a fair comparison of power between the test with and

the effect of air supply on the pump's ability to lift water and remove
particles under different submergence ratios and particle concentrations. In
addition, a simple yet accurate fluid mechanical model is used to rationalize
the experiments with individual particles, and to predict the critical water
velocity required for removal from the pipe bend.
  Our experimental results show that the airlift pump is self-cleansing for
particle concentrations corresponding to as much as 70% of the cross-sectional

independent of the submergence ratio and almost entirely determined by the
shear stress. However, the submergence ratio strongly affects energy use, and
we find that submergence ratios around 0.75 provide a good compromise between
energy use and particle removal efficiency.

different jet bulk speed velocities. Combining the present data with published

computational pathology. Deep learning-based models have achieved superior
performance but centralized training with data centralization suffers from the
privacy leakage problem. Federated learning (FL) can safeguard privacy by
keeping training samples locally, but existing FL-based frameworks require a
large number of well-annotated training samples and numerous rounds of
communication which hinder their practicability in the real-world clinical
scenario. In this paper, we propose a universal and lightweight federated
learning framework, named Federated Deep-Broad Learning (FedDBL), to achieve
superior classification performance with limited training samples and only
one-round communication. By simply associating a pre-trained deep learning
feature extractor, a fast and lightweight broad learning inference system and a
classical federated aggregation approach, FedDBL can dramatically reduce data
dependency and improve communication efficiency. Five-fold cross-validation
demonstrates that FedDBL greatly outperforms the competitors with only
one-round communication and limited training samples, while it even achieves
comparable performance with the ones under multiple-round communications.
Furthermore, due to the lightweight design and one-round communication, FedDBL
reduces the communication burden from 4.6GB to only 276.5KB per client using
the ResNet-50 backbone at 50-round training. Since no data or deep model
sharing across different clients, the privacy issue is well-solved and the
model security is guaranteed with no model inversion attack risk. Code is

jointly optimize the beamforming at the base station (BS) and the discrete IRS
phase shifts to minimize the total transmit power. For attaining the globally
optimal solution of the formulated non-convex combinatorial optimization
problem, we develop a resource allocation algorithm with guaranteed convergence
based on Schur's complement and the generalized Bender's decomposition. Our
numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce

dynamical systems is largely explained by the networks' capacity to model
complex input-output relations directly from data. However, they typically need
vast training data before they can be put to any good use. The data generation
process for dynamical systems can be an expensive endeavor both in terms of
time and resources. Active learning addresses this shortcoming by acquiring the
most informative data, thereby reducing the need to collect enormous datasets.
What makes the current work unique is integrating the deep active learning
framework into nonlinear system identification. We formulate a general static
deep active learning acquisition problem for nonlinear system identification.
This is enabled by exploring system dynamics locally in different regions of
the input space to obtain a simulated dataset covering the broader input space.
This simulated dataset can be used in a static deep active learning acquisition
scheme referred to as global explorations. The global exploration acquires a
batch of initial states corresponding to the most informative state-action
trajectories according to a batch acquisition function. The local exploration
solves an optimal control problem, finding the control trajectory that
maximizes some measure of information. After a batch of informative initial
states is acquired, a new round of local explorations from the initial states
in the batch is conducted to obtain a set of corresponding control trajectories
that are to be applied on the system dynamics to get data from the system.
Information measures used in the acquisition scheme are derived from the
predictive variance of an ensemble of neural networks. The novel method
outperforms standard data acquisition methods used for system identification of
nonlinear dynamical systems in the case study performed on simulated data.

with a Curie temperature around 146 K. Unlike many other known two-dimensional
(2D) magnets, CrSBr has an orthorhombic lattice, giving rise, for instance, to
spatial anisotropy of the magnetic excitations within the 2D plane. Theoretical
description of CrSBr within a spin Hamiltonian approach turns out to be
nontrivial due to the triaxial magnetic anisotropy as well as due to magnetic
dipolar interactions, comparable to spin-orbit effects in CrSBr. Here, we
employ a Green's function formalism combined with first-principles calculations
to systematically study the magnetic properties of monolayer CrSBr in different
regimes of surrounding dielectric screening. We find that the magnetic
anisotropy and thermodynamical properties of CrSBr depend significantly on the
Coulomb interaction and its external screening. In the free-standing limit, the
system turns out to be close to an easy-plane magnet, whose long-range ordering
is partially suppressed. On the contrary, in the regime of large external
screening, monolayer CrSBr behaves like an easy-axis ferromagnet with more
stable magnetic ordering. Despite being relatively large, the magnetic dipolar
interactions have only little effect on the magnetic properties. Our findings

decision making. Given a sequence of actions, responsibility attribution
mechanisms quantify the impact of each participating agent to the final
outcome. One such popular mechanism is based on actual causality, and it
assigns (causal) responsibility based on the actions that were found to be
pivotal for the considered outcome. However, the inherent problem of
pinpointing actual causes and consequently determining the exact responsibility
assignment has shown to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we aim
to provide a practical algorithmic solution to the problem of responsibility
attribution under a computational budget. We first formalize the problem in the
framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes
(Dec-POMDPs) augmented by a specific class of Structural Causal Models (SCMs).
Under this framework, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) type of
method which efficiently approximates the agents' degrees of responsibility.
This method utilizes the structure of a novel search tree and a pruning
technique, both tailored to the problem of responsibility attribution. Other
novel components of our method are (a) a child selection policy based on linear
scalarization and (b) a backpropagation procedure that accounts for a
minimality condition that is typically used to define actual causality. We
experimentally evaluate the efficacy of our algorithm through a
simulation-based test-bed, which includes three team-based card games.

recent years. The problem can be approached by looking at different protected
attributes (e.g., ethnicity, gender, etc) independently, but fairness for
individual protected attributes does not imply intersectional fairness. In this
work, we frame the problem of intersectional fairness within a geometrical
setting. We project our data onto a hypercube, and split the analysis of
fairness by levels, where each level encodes the number of protected attributes
we are intersecting over. We prove mathematically that, while fairness does not
propagate ""down"" the levels, it does propagate ""up"" the levels. This means that
ensuring fairness for all subgroups at the lowest intersectional level (e.g.,
black women, white women, black men and white men), will necessarily result in
fairness for all the above levels, including each of the protected attributes
(e.g., ethnicity and gender) taken independently. We also derive a formula
describing the variance of the set of estimated success rates on each level,
under the assumption of perfect fairness. Using this theoretical finding as a
benchmark, we define a family of metrics which capture overall intersectional
bias. Finally, we propose that fairness can be metaphorically thought of as a
""fractal"" problem. In fractals, patterns at the smallest scale repeat at a
larger scale. We see from this example that tackling the problem at the lowest
possible level, in a bottom-up manner, leads to the natural emergence of fair
AI. We suggest that trustworthiness is necessarily an emergent, fractal and
relational property of the AI system.

collisions is the subject of many experimental and theoretical efforts in
nuclear physics. This topic is also very relevant for astrophysics, since the
rare production of antinuclei in our Universe could be a doorway to discover
new physics. In this work, we describe a new coalescence afterburner for event
generators based on the Wigner function formalism and we apply it to the
(anti)deuteron case, taking into account a realistic particle emitting source.
The model performance is validated using the EPOS and PYTHIA event generators
applied to proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=$ 13
TeV, triggered for high multiplicity events, and the experimental data measured
by ALICE in the same collision system. The model relies on the direct
measurement of the particle emitting source carried out by means of
nucleon-nucleon femtoscopic correlations in the same collision system and
energy. The resulting parameter-free model is used to predict deuteron
differential spectra assuming different deuteron wavefunctions within the
Wigner function formalism. The predicted deuteron spectra show a clear
sensitivity to the choice of the deuteron wavefunction. The Argonne $v_{18}$
wavefunction provides the best description of the experimental data. This model
can now be used to study the production of (anti)deuterons over a wide range of
collision energies and be extended to heavier nuclei.

weighting of Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), and we
demonstrate that this makes it possible to robustly address multi-objective and
multi-scale problems. BPINNs are a popular framework for data assimilation,
combining the constraints of Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and Partial
Differential Equation (PDE). The relative weights of the BPINN target
distribution terms are directly related to the inherent uncertainty in the
respective learning tasks. Yet, they are usually manually set a-priori, that
can lead to pathological behavior, stability concerns, and to conflicts between
tasks which are obstacles that have deterred the use of BPINNs for inverse
problems with multi-scale dynamics. The present weighting strategy
automatically tunes the weights by considering the multi-task nature of target
posterior distribution. We show that this remedies the failure modes of BPINNs
and provides efficient exploration of the optimal Pareto front. This leads to
better convergence and stability of BPINN training while reducing sampling
bias. The determined weights moreover carry information about task
uncertainties, reflecting noise levels in the data and adequacy of the PDE
model. We demonstrate this in numerical experiments in Sobolev training, and
compare them to analytically $\epsilon$-optimal baseline, and in a multi-scale
Lokta-Volterra inverse problem. We eventually apply this framework to an
inpainting task and an inverse problem, involving latent field recovery for
incompressible flow in complex geometries.

Standard Model (SM) requires the existence of a new set of fields, called
portal matter (PM), which carry both SM and dark sector quantum numbers, some
whose masses may lie at the TeV scale. In the vanilla KM model, the dark gauge
group is just the simple $G_{Dark}=U(1)_D$ needed to describe the DP while the
SM gauge interactions are described by the usual $G_{SM}=SU(3)_c\times
SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$. However, we need to go beyond this simple model to gain
a better understanding of the interplay between $G_{SM}$ and $G_{Dark}$ and, in
particular, determine how they both might fit into a more unified construction.
Following our previous analyses, this generally requires $G_{Dark}$ to be
extended to a non-abelian group, \eg, $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{Y_I}$, under which
both the PM and SM fields may transform non-trivially. In this paper, also
inspired by our earlier work on top-down models, we consider extending the SM
gauge group to that of the Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRM) and, in doing so,
through common vacuum expectation values, link the mass scales associated with
the breaking of $G_{Dark}\to U(1)_D$ and the PM fields to that of the
RH-neutrino as well as the heavy gauge bosons of the LRM. This leads to an
interesting interplay between the now coupled phenomenologies of both visible

stellar winds. Magnetohydrodynamic models have been successful in exploring the
dependence of this ""wind-braking torque"" on various stellar properties, however
the influence of surface differential rotation is largely unexplored. As the
wind-braking torque depends on the rotation rate of the escaping wind, the
inclusion of differential rotation should effectively modulate the angular
momentum-loss rate based on the latitudinal variation of wind source regions.
In order to quantify the influence of surface differential rotation on the
angular momentum-loss rate of the Sun, we exploit the dependence of the
wind-braking torque on the effective rotation rate of the coronal magnetic
field. This quantity is evaluated by tracing field lines through a Potential
Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, driven by ADAPT-GONG magnetograms. The
surface rotation rates of the open magnetic field lines are then used to
construct an open-flux weighted rotation rate, from which the influence on the
wind-braking torque can be estimated. During solar minima, the rotation rate of
the corona decreases with respect to the typical solid-body rate (the
Carrington rotation period is 25.4 days), as the sources of the solar wind
shift towards the slowly-rotating poles. With increasing activity, more solar
wind emerges from the Sun's active latitudes which enforces a Carrington-like
rotation. The effect of differential rotation on the Sun's current wind-braking
torque is found to be small. The wind-braking torque is ~10-15% lower during
solar minimum, than assuming solid body rotation, and a few percent larger
during solar maximum. For more rapidly-rotating Sun-like stars, differential
rotation may play a more significant role, depending on the configuration of
the large-scale magnetic field.

Integrating multi-omics data has been proven to be effective for building more

use early fusion by concatenation or late fusion based on deep neural networks.
Due to the nature of biological systems, graphs are a better representation of
bio-medical data. Although few graph neural network (GNN) based multi-omics
integrative methods have been proposed, they suffer from three common
disadvantages. One is most of them use only one type of connection, either
inter-omics or intra-omic connection; second, they only consider one kind of
GNN layer, either graph convolution network (GCN) or graph attention network
(GAT); and third, most of these methods lack testing on a more complex cancer
classification task. We propose a novel end-to-end multi-omics GNN framework
for accurate and robust cancer subtype classification. The proposed model
utilizes multi-omics data in the form of heterogeneous multi-layer graphs that
combines both inter-omics and intra-omic connections from established
biological knowledge. The proposed model incorporates learned graph features
and global genome features for accurate classification. We test the proposed
model on TCGA Pan-cancer dataset and TCGA breast cancer dataset for molecular
subtype and cancer subtype classification, respectively. The proposed model
outperforms four current state-of-the-art baseline models in multiple

experimentally determine how complex a molecule is and how that correlates with
information-theoretic approaches that estimate molecular complexity. Assembly
Theory has been developed to quantify the complexity of a molecule by finding
the shortest path to construct the molecule from simple parts, revealing its
molecular assembly index (MA). In this study, we present an approach to rapidly
and exhaustively calculate molecular assembly and explore the MA of over 10,000
molecules. We demonstrate that molecular complexity (MA) can be experimentally
measured using three independent techniques: nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
tandem mass spectrometry (MS), and infrared spectroscopy (IR), and these give
consistent results with good correlations. By identifying and counting the
number of absorbances in IR spectra, carbon resonances in NMR, or molecular
fragments in tandem MS, the molecular assembly index of an unknown molecule can
be reliably estimated from experimental data. This represents the first
experimentally quantifiable approach to defining molecular assembly, a reliable
metric for complexity, as an intrinsic property of all molecules and can also
be performed on complex mixtures. This paves the way to use spectroscopic
techniques to unambiguously detect alien life in the solar system, and beyond
on exoplanets.

asserted the following: the Compton-Simon experiment showed that the state
vector must collapse upon measurement of any self-adjoint operator. Comparing
von Neumann's account with the Compton-Simon paper, we find that von Neumann
had misinterpreted the experiment as consisting of two successive measurements
(which gave identical results), whereas the experiment only measured two angles
on the same photographic plate. Note, however, that the state vector must
collapse upon measurement of an additively-conserved quantity; otherwise the
conservation law could be violated. Next, it turns out that the mathematical
problem of explaining collapse is not fully defined until one specifies the
nature of the apparatus. If the apparatus does not have a `classical
description', the problem is insoluble, even if the measurement is only
approximate (Fine, Simony, Brown, Simony and Busch); but if it does, the
problem is soluble within Schroedinger dynamics (with a time-dependent
hamiltonian) for additively-conserved observables. The solution, a modification
of Sewell's, shows that the state vector has collapsed, but it does not reveal
the eigenvalue of the collapsed state. The collapse is irreversible, and
results from the interplay of additive conservation laws with the quantum
measurement postulate. Indeed, the quantum measurement problem - as expounded
by Wigner - may be better understood as the problem of establishing that the
two are compatible with each other; it has little relevance to actual
measurements.

shortest path length exhibits a systematic trend in achieving higher degree of

acts firstly as dark energy and secondly as a fluid that builds the dark
matter. Assisted by a small fraction of net charges in a cosmic plasma, zero
point energy can condense on mass concentrations. No longer participating in
the cosmic expansion, they constitute ``electro-zero-point energy'' (EZPE),
which offers a solution to the dark matter riddle without new physics. An
electric field of 1 kV/m pointing from the center of the Galaxy is
predicted.EZPE can cover the results deduced with MOND. Instability of linear
perturbations motivates a speedy filling of a constant-density dark matter
core. EZPE solves the hydrostatic equilibrium puzzle in galaxy clusters. Cool
cluster cores may result from expanding cores. Flowing in of EZPE explains why
early black holes can become supermassive, why they can have any mass and
overcome the final parsec problem when merging. EZPE implies rupture of clouds,
e.g., reducing the primordial baryon cloud to the cosmic web. The large
coherence scale of the electric field acts as a scaffold for gentle galaxy
formation and their vast polar structures. In galaxy merging and galactic bars,
EZPE does not cause dynamical friction. At cosmological scales, it acts as
pressureless dark matter. Its energy density increases in time, which softens
the Hubble tension by late time physics. Of the large cosmological constant
injected at the big bang, a small part remains. At early times, inflation
occurs automatically.

Continuous learning is a promising way to deal with this issue; however, it

highly required in segmentation data for real-world applications, which further
calls for on-device learning. In this paper, we aim to resolve the above issue

develop efficient unsupervised segmentation that can be executed on edge

when pixels are mapped to a high-dimension space, we for the first time bring
brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) to the segmentation task. We
build the HDC-based unsupervised segmentation framework, namely ""SegHDC"". In
SegHDC, we devise a novel encoding approach that follows the Manhattan
distance. A clustering algorithm is further developed on top of the encoded
high-dimension vectors to obtain segmentation results. Experimental results
show SegHDC can significantly surpass neural network-based unsupervised
segmentation. On a standard segmentation dataset, DSB2018, SegHDC can achieve a
28.0% improvement in Intersection over Union (IoU) score; meanwhile, it
achieves over 300x speedup on Raspberry PI. What's more, for a larger size

fine-tuned DistilRoBERTa model, which was used to compare COVID-19
vaccine-related Twitter posts (tweets) that co-occurred with mentions of People
in the Public Eye. Our findings suggest the presence of consistent patterns of
emotional content co-occurring with messaging shared by Persons in the Public
Eye for the first two years of the COVID-19 pandemic influenced public opinion
and largely stimulated online public discourse. We demonstrate that as the
pandemic progressed, public sentiment shared on social networks was shaped by
risk perceptions, political ideologies and health-protective behaviours shared
by Persons in the Public Eye, often in a negative light.

nef anti-canonical bundle is, up to a finite \'etale cover, one of the
following: a manifold with vanishing first Chern class; the product of a K3
surface and the projective line; the projective space bundle of a numerically
flat vector bundle over a torus. This result extends Cao-H\""oring's structure
theorem for projective manifolds to compact K\""ahler manifolds in dimension
three. For the proof, we study the Minimal Model Program for compact K\""ahler
$3$-folds with nef anti-canonical bundle by using the positivity of direct
image sheaves, $\mathbb{Q}$-conic bundles, and orbifold vector bundles.

  Variational Flow","15 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Designing molecules that bind to specific target proteins is a fundamental
task in drug discovery. Recent models leverage geometric constraints to
generate ligand molecules that bind cohesively with specific protein pockets.
However, these models cannot effectively generate 3D molecules with 2D skeletal
curtailments and property constraints, which are pivotal to drug potency and
development. To tackle this challenge, we propose GraphVF, a variational
flow-based framework that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry, for
controllable generation of binding 3D molecules. Empirically, our method
achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity and realistic sub-structural layouts
for protein-specific generation. In particular, GraphVF represents the first
controllable geometry-aware, protein-specific molecule generation method, which
can generate binding 3D molecules with tailored sub-structures and
physio-chemical properties. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Franco-Solis/GraphVF-code.

within the field of structural engineering, despite its existence in the
closely related domain of geotechnics. This paper proposes the novel concept of
a structural influence zone in relation to continuous beam systems and explores
its size numerically with various design constraints applicable to steel framed
buildings. The key challenge involves explicitly defining the critical load
arrangements, and is tackled by using the novel concepts of polarity sequences
and polarity zones. These lead to the identification of flexural and (discovery
of) shear load arrangements, with an equation demarcating when the latter
arises. After developing algorithms that help identify both types of critical
load arrangements, design data sets are generated and the influence zone values
are extracted. The results indicate that the influence zone under ultimate
state considerations is typically less than 3, rising to a maximum size of 5
adjacent members for any given continuous beam. Additional insights from the
influence zone concept, specifically in comparison to influence lines, are
highlighted, and the avenues for future research, such as in relation to the
newly identified shear load arrangements, are discussed.

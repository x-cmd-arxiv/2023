Understanding the risk of LMs leaking Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

that dataset curation techniques such as scrubbing are sufficient to prevent
PII leakage. Scrubbing techniques reduce but do not prevent the risk of PII
leakage: in practice scrubbing is imperfect and must balance the trade-off
between minimizing disclosure and preserving the utility of the dataset. On the
other hand, it is unclear to which extent algorithmic defenses such as
differential privacy, designed to guarantee sentence- or user-level privacy,
prevent PII disclosure. In this work, we introduce rigorous game-based
definitions for three types of PII leakage via black-box extraction, inference,

evaluate the attacks against GPT-2 models fine-tuned with and without defenses

However, these 2D ferromagnetic layers are mainly prepared through an
incompatible approach for large-scale fabrication and integration, and
moreover, a fundamental question whether the observed ferromagnetism actually
correlates with the 2D crystalline order has not been explored. Here, we choose
a typical 2D ferromagnetic material, Fe3GeTe2, to address these two issues by
investigating its ferromagnetism in an amorphous state. We have fabricated
nanometer-thick amorphous Fe3GeTe2 films approaching the monolayer thickness
limit of crystallized Fe3GeTe2 (0.8 nm) through magnetron sputtering. Compared
to crystallized Fe3GeTe2, we found that the basic ferromagnetic attributes,
such as the Curie temperature that directly reflects magnetic exchange
interactions and local anisotropic energy, do not change significantly in the
amorphous states. This is attributed to that the short-range atomic order, as
confirmed by valence state analysis, is almost the same for both phases. The
persistence of ferromagnetism in the ultrathin amorphous counterpart has also
been confirmed through magnetoresistance measurements, where two unconventional
switching dips arising from electrical transport within domain walls are
clearly observed in the amorphous Fe3GeTe2 single layer. These results indicate
that the long-range ferromagnetic order of crystallized Fe3GeTe2 may not
correlate to the 2D crystalline order and the corresponding ferromagnetic
attributes can be utilized in an amorphous state which suits large-scale
fabrication in a semiconductor technology-compatible manner for spintronics

existing work: skeletal motion retargeting, which leverages long-term temporal
context at the cost of surface detail, and surface-based retargeting, which
preserves surface details without considering long-term temporal context. We
unify the advantages of these works by combining a learnt skinning field with a

the input can be processed in a serial way, and retargeting is performed in a
single forward pass per frame. Experiments show that including long-term
temporal context during training improves the method's accuracy both in terms

think. In an online experiment, we asked participants (N=1,506) to write a post
discussing whether social media is good for society. Treatment group
participants used a language-model-powered writing assistant configured to
argue that social media is good or bad for society. Participants then completed
a social media attitude survey, and independent judges (N=500) evaluated the
opinions expressed in their writing. Using the opinionated language model
affected the opinions expressed in participants' writing and shifted their

subject to a repulsion force in case of overlaps and an active force. The
orientation of the disks is chosen randomly in the beginning and does not
change anytime during the simulation thus corresponding to an infinite
persistence length. Simulations with our model system reveal that jammed
clusters of particles occur in the dense phase of a phase-separated state in
case of intermediate values of the ratio of active to repulsive force. However,
for smaller activities there are only a few overlaps between the particles in
the dense phase and the coexistence region ends at a packing fraction below the
onset of jamming. Finally, for large activities small clusters corresponding to
small patches of the dense phase are found that are unstable due to the
activity. Our findings on how jamming and phase separation are related are
relevant to many active particle systems whose zero temperature and long

schemes. We first implement a single-task scheduling version, which schedules
at most one task each time. Then we generalize to the multi-task scheduling
case, in which a sequence of tasks is scheduled simultaneously. Our design can
mitigate the expanded decision space and yield fast convergence to optimal
scheduling solutions. Extensive experiments using synthetic and test-bed ML
task traces show that TapFinger can achieve up to 54.9% reduction in the
average task completion time and improve resource efficiency as compared to

we propose an automated, geometry-based approach for the unfolding, point-wise

thickness and curvature. Starting from an automated segmentation of hippocampal
subfields, we create a 3D tetrahedral mesh model as well as a 3D intrinsic
coordinate system of the hippocampal body. From this coordinate system, we
derive local curvature and thickness estimates as well as a 2D sheet for
hippocampal unfolding. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm with a
series of experiments to quantify neurodegenerative changes in Mild Cognitive
Impairment and Alzheimer's disease dementia. We find that hippocampal thickness
estimates detect known differences between clinical groups and can determine
the location of these effects on the hippocampal sheet. Further, thickness
estimates improve classification of clinical groups and cognitively unimpaired
controls when added as an additional predictor. Comparable results are obtained
with different datasets and segmentation algorithms. Taken together, we
replicate canonical findings on hippocampal volume/shape changes in dementia,
extend them by gaining insight into their spatial localization on the
hippocampal sheet, and provide additional, complementary information beyond
traditional measures. We provide a new set of sensitive processing and analysis

of projections, the elapsed time of 3D DECT SIR is often not clinically
acceptable. Therefore, to improve its convergence, we have embedded DECT SIR
into a deep learning model-based unrolled network for 3D DECT reconstruction
(MB-DECTNet) that can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. This deep
learning-based method is trained to learn the shortcuts between the initial
conditions and the stationary points of iterative algorithms while preserving
the unbiased estimation property of model-based algorithms. MB-DECTNet is
formed by stacking multiple update blocks, each of which consists of a data
consistency layer (DC) and a spatial mixer layer, where the spatial mixer layer
is the shrunken U-Net, and the DC layer is a one-step update of an arbitrary

that MB-DECTNet with DEAM significantly reduces noise while increasing the

  This complex behavior emerges from the interplay of strong spin-orbit

stars, i.e., circumbinary planets (CBPs), we applied techniques from dynamical
systems theory to a physically motivated set of solutions in the Circular
Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP). We applied Floquet theory to
characterize the linear dynamical behavior -- static, oscillatory, or
exponential -- surrounding planar circumbinary periodic trajectories (limit
cycles). We computed prograde and retrograde limit cycles and analyzed their
geometries, stability bifurcations, and dynamical structures. Orbit and
stability calculations are exact computations in the CR3BP and reproducible
through the open-source Python package pyraa. The periodic trajectories produce
a set of non-crossing, dynamically cool circumbinary orbits conducive to
planetesimal growth. For mass ratios $\mu \in [0.01, 0.50]$ we found recurring
features in the prograde families. These features include: (1) an innermost
near-circular trajectory, inside which solutions have resonant geometries, (2)
an innermost stable trajectory ($a_{cr} \approx 1.61 - 1.85 \, a_\textrm{bin}$)
characterized by a tangent bifurcating limit cycle, and (3) a region of
dynamical instability ($a \approx 2.1 \ a_\textrm{bin}; \Delta a \approx 0.1 \
a_\textrm{bin}$), the exclusion zone, bounded by a pair of critically stable
trajectories -- bifurcating limit cycles. The exterior boundary of the
exclusion zone is consistent with prior determinations of $a_{cr}$ around a
circular binary. We validate our analytic results with N-body simulations and
apply them to the Pluto-Charon system. The absence of detected CBPs in the
inner stable region, between the prograde exclusion zone and $a_{cr}$, suggests
that the exclusion zone may inhibit the inward migration of CBPs.

However, to date, relatively little is known about the characteristics and

concerning habitat transitions among a variety of bacterial and archaeal
lineages, considering the frequency of migration events, potential
environmental barriers, and mechanisms of adaptation to new physicochemical
conditions, including the modification of protein inventories and other genomic
characteristics. Cells dependent on microbial hosts, particularly bacteria from
the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), have undergone repeated habitat
transitions from environmental sources into animal microbiomes. We compare
their trajectories to those of both free-living cells - including the
Melainabacteria, Elusimicrobia, and methanogenic archaea - as well as cellular
endosymbionts and bacteriophages, which have made similar transitions. We
conclude by highlighting major related topics that may be worthy of future

series trials in contexts where significant event times like onsets and offsets
vary between trials. These variations prevent direct comparisons of trials in
practical contexts as comparisons require equal-length time series (Salari et
al., 2019). Algorithms like dynamic time warping help us quantify these
variations locally but do not apply well to continuous transformations of time
series signals without interpolating or downsampling to add or remove samples
(Jamid, 2004; Eckner, 2014). I show that with consideration for padding and
sampling frequency that sinc interpolation is sufficient to resample parts of
trial intervals to produce equal-length time-locked trials that correlate to
and strongly approximate their unwarped counterparts with minimal interpolation
effects. Specifically I show that interpolation effects can be minimized by
oversampling, selectively interpolating mis-aligned parts of trials with
respect to mean mis-aligned event lengths, and interpolating mis-aligned events
with sufficient zero-padding. Interpolated signals then have a bandlimit well
below the Nyquist frequency and satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem
ensuring perfect reconstructions, and I find that I can track and potentially
counteract resampling effects on signal energy quantities.

Moreover, the band renormalization shows a strong selection rule favoring pump

study black hole characteristics and their environment. We simulate TDEs with
the PHANTOM code in a general relativistic and Newtonian description of a
supermassive black hole's gravity. Stars, which are placed on parabolic orbits
with different parameters $\beta$, are constructed with the stellar evolution
code MESA and therefore have realistic stellar density profiles. We study the
mass fallback rate of the debris $\dot{M}$ and its dependence on the $\beta$,
stellar mass and age as well as the black hole's spin and the choice of the
gravity's description. We calculate peak value $\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}$, time to
the peak $t_\mathrm{peak}$, duration of the super-Eddington phase
$t_\mathrm{Edd}$, time $t_{>0.5\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}}$ during which
$\dot{M}>0.5\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}$, early rise-time $\tau_\mathrm{rise}$ and
late-time slope $n_\infty$. We recover the trends of $\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}$,
$t_\mathrm{peak}$, $\tau_\mathrm{rise}$ and $n_\infty$ with $\beta$, stellar
mass and age, which were obtained in previous studies. We find that
$t_\mathrm{Edd}$, at a fixed $\beta$, scales primarily with the stellar mass,
while $t_{>0.5\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}}$ scales with the compactness of stars. The
effect of SMBH's rotation depends on the orientation of its rotational axis
relative to the direction of the stellar motion on the initial orbit.
Encounters on prograde orbits result in narrower $\dot{M}$ curves with higher
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}$, while the opposite occurs for retrograde orbits. We
find that disruptions, at the same pericenter distance, are stronger in a
relativistic tidal field than in a Newtonian. Therefore, relativistic $\dot{M}$
curves have higher $\dot{M}_\mathrm{peak}$, and shorter $t_\mathrm{peak}$ and
$t_\mathrm{Edd}$.

subsurface optoelectronic properties of the solar cells. We compare the
nanoscale optoelectronic properties before and after the FIB polishing.
Simultaneously collected Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM) and atomic force

CdTe pristine (peak-to-valley roughness of approximately 600 nm) follows the

dispersion by characterizing the dynamics of lump and soliton waves on
different spatially-varying backgrounds. We construct explicit lump wave and
kink-soliton solutions for the considered model through its trilinear and
bilinear equations with appropriate forms of the polynomial and
exponential-type initial seed solutions, respectively. Additionally, we obtain
hyperbolic and periodic waves through bilinear B\""acklund transformation. We
explore their propagation and transformation dynamics with spatial backgrounds
through a categorical analysis and clear graphical demonstrations to fully
understand the resulting solutions. Our analysis shows that the lump solution
results into a simultaneous existence of well-localized spike and declining
(coupled bright-dark type wave) structures on a constant background, while the
soliton solution exhibits kink and anti-kink wave patterns along different
spatio-temporal domains with controllable properties. When the arbitrary
spatial background is incorporated appropriately, we can witness the
manifestation of soliton into periodic and interacting dynamical structures. On
the other hand, the lump wave results into the coexistence, interacting wave
and breather formation due to periodic and localized type spatial backgrounds.
The results will be an important addition to the context of nonlinear waves

of data-driven scientific discoveries. However, in order to truly leverage
large-scale data sets and high-throughput experimental setups, machine learning
methods will need to be further improved and better integrated in the
scientific discovery pipeline. A key challenge for current machine learning
methods in this context is the efficient exploration of very large search
spaces, which requires techniques for estimating reducible (epistemic)
uncertainty and generating sets of diverse and informative experiments to
perform. This motivated a new probabilistic machine learning framework called
GFlowNets, which can be applied in the modeling, hypotheses generation and
experimental design stages of the experimental science loop. GFlowNets learn to
sample from a distribution given indirectly by a reward function corresponding
to an unnormalized probability, which enables sampling diverse, high-reward
candidates. GFlowNets can also be used to form efficient and amortized Bayesian
posterior estimators for causal models conditioned on the already acquired
experimental data. Having such posterior models can then provide estimators of
epistemic uncertainty and information gain that can drive an experimental
design policy. Altogether, here we will argue that GFlowNets can become a
valuable tool for AI-driven scientific discovery, especially in scenarios of
very large candidate spaces where we have access to cheap but inaccurate
measurements or to expensive but accurate measurements. This is a common
setting in the context of drug and material discovery, which we use as examples

Here we recall that the exerted acoustic radiation force in an acoustic field,
resulting from an incident wave, a scattered wave, and the radiated wave from
the active carrier, can be positive, negative or zero based on the location of
the object in the field. Thus in a general case, a sustainable pulling motion
is not guaranteed. In this work, by considering the point that the average of
the radiation force for an object, active in a single mode, over a complete
wavelength is equal to the radiation force applied to a passive object (which
is always positive), we put forward a technique to generate the acoustic
radiation force with negative average over a complete wavelength to ensure that
the net motion is attractive. The idea here is a simultaneous excitation of the
object in two modes of breathing and first, with a difference in the phase of
excitations. We will also show that by controlling the phase difference, the
average of the force exerted on the object can be positive, negative or zero.
Moreover, we show that for specific phase differences not only the average of
the force is negative but also the force itself never experiences a positive
value in a whole wavelength at those phase differences, which this can be a
desired state to achieve a perfect negative net motion.

compress a given quantum source below its von Neumann entropy. Inspired by the
duality connections between the rate-distortion and channel coding problems in
the classical setting, we propose a new formulation for the lossy quantum
source coding problem. This formulation differs from the existing quantum
rate-distortion theory in two aspects. Firstly, we require that the
reconstruction of the compressed quantum source fulfill a global error
constraint as opposed to the sample-wise local error criterion used in the
standard rate-distortion setting. Secondly, instead of a distortion observable,
we employ the notion of a backward quantum channel, which we refer to as a
""posterior reference map"", to measure the reconstruction error. Using these, we
characterize the asymptotic performance limit of the lossy quantum source
coding problem in terms of single-letter coherent information of the given
posterior reference map. We demonstrate a protocol to encode (at the specified
rate) and decode, with the reconstruction satisfying the provided global error
criterion, and therefore achieving the asymptotic performance limit. The
protocol is constructed by decomposing coherent information as a difference of
two Holevo information quantities, inspired from prior works in quantum
communication problems. To further support the findings, we develop analogous
formulations for the quantum-classical and classical variants and express the
asymptotic performance limit in terms of single-letter mutual information
quantities with respect to appropriately defined channels analogous to
posterior reference maps. We also provide various examples for the three
formulations, and shed light on their connection to the standard

Its effectiveness relies heavily on the ability to predict the future state of
health of the system, and for this survival models have shown to be very
useful. Due to the complex behavior of system degradation, data-driven methods
are often preferred, and neural network-based methods have been shown to
perform particularly very well. Many neural network-based methods have been
proposed and successfully applied to many problems. However, most models rely
on assumptions that often are quite restrictive and there is an interest to
find more expressive models. Energy-based models are promising candidates for
this due to their successful use in other applications, which include natural
language processing and computer vision. The focus of this work is therefore to
investigate how energy-based models can be used for survival modeling and
predictive maintenance. A key step in using energy-based models for survival
modeling is the introduction of right-censored data, which, based on a maximum
likelihood approach, is shown to be a straightforward process. Another
important part of the model is the evaluation of the integral used to normalize
the modeled probability density function, and it is shown how this can be done
efficiently. The energy-based survival model is evaluated using both simulated
data and experimental data in the form of starter battery failures from a fleet
of vehicles, and its performance is found to be highly competitive compared to
existing models.

(hyper-)graphs whose colors represent interaction types. More specifically, the
goal is to select as many edges as possible without choosing two edges that
share an endpoint and are colored differently. Equivalently, the goal can also
be described as assigning colors to the vertices in a way that fits the
edge-coloring as well as possible. As this problem is NP-hard, we build on
previous work by studying its parameterized complexity. We give a $2^{\mathcal
O(k)} \cdot n^{\mathcal O(1)}$-time algorithm where $k$ is the number of edges
to be selected and $n$ the number of vertices. We also prove the existence of a
problem kernel of size $\mathcal O(k^{5/2} )$, resolving an open problem posed
in the literature. We consider parameters that are smaller than $k$, the number
of edges to be selected, and $r$, the number of edges that can be deleted. Such
smaller parameters are obtained by considering the difference between $k$ or
$r$ and some lower bound on these values. We give both algorithms and lower
bounds for Colored Clustering with such parameterizations. Finally, we settle
the parameterized complexity of Colored Clustering with respect to structural
graph parameters by showing that it is $W[1]$-hard with respect to both vertex
cover number and tree-cut width, but fixed-parameter tractable with respect to

Therefore, a high-fidelity LES database is built to develop and assess novel
wall models for AM. This article investigates the flow in rough pipes built
from the surfaces created using AM techniques at Siemens based on Nickel Alloy
IN939 material. We developed a code to generate the desired rough pipes from
scanned planar surfaces and performed high-fidelity LES of turbulent rough pipe
flows at Re = 11,700 to reveal the influence of roughness on turbulence, mainly
the average roughness height and the Effective Slope. The equivalent sand-grain
roughnesses, ks, of the present AM rough surfaces are predicted using the
Colebrook correlation. In the present study, the existence of a logarithmic
layer is marked even for high values of ks. The mean flow, the velocity
fluctuations, and the Reynolds stresses show turbulence's strong dependence on
the roughness topography. Profiles of turbulence statistics are compared by
introducing an effective wall-normal distance. The effective distance collapses
the shear stresses and the velocity fluctuations outside the roughness
sublayer; thus, Townsend's similarity of the streamwise mean velocity is marked
for the present roughnesses. Furthermore, a mixed scaling is introduced to
improve the collapse of turbulence statistics in the roughness sublayer.

The developed model fully considers the effect of evaporative cooling and the

accounting for the effect of the gas phase composition and the diffusion of
vapour in the atmosphere of the droplets. Using the framework of lubrication
theory, we derive evolution equations for both the droplet profile and the
displacement of the elastic solid, which are solved in combination with
Laplace's equation for the vapour concentration in the gas phase. A
disjoining-pressure/precursor-film approach is used to describe contact-line
motion. The evolution equations are solved numerically, using the
finite-element method, and we present a thorough parametric analysis to
investigate the physical properties and mechanisms that affect the dynamics of
droplet interactions. The results show that the droplets interact through both
the soft substrate and the gas phase. In the absence of thermocapillary
phenomena, the combined effect of non-uniform evaporation due to the increased
vapour concentration between the two droplets and elastocapillary phenonema
determines whether the drop-drop interaction is attractive or repulsive. The
Marangoni stresses suppress droplet attraction at the early stages of the
drying process and lead to longer droplet lifetimes. For substrates with
intermediate stiffness, the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at late
stages of evaporation is found. The rich dynamics of this complex system is
explored through the construction of a detailed flow map.

increase the rate of events at other nodes, depending on their influence
relationship. Thus, it is of interest to use temporal data to uncover the
directional, time-dependent, influence structure of a given network while also
quantifying uncertainty even when knowledge of a physical network is lacking.
Typically, methods for inferring the influence structure in networks require
knowledge of a physical network or are only able to infer small network
structures. In this paper, we model event-driven dynamics on a network by a
multidimensional Hawkes process. We then develop a novel ensemble-based
filtering approach for a time-series of count data (i.e., data that provides
the number of events per unit time for each node in the network) that not only
tracks the influence network structure over time but also approximates the
uncertainty via ensemble spread. The method overcomes several deficiencies in
existing methods such as existing methods for inferring multidimensional Hawkes
processes are too slow to be practical for any network over ~50 nodes, can only
deal with timestamp data (i.e. data on just when events occur not the number of
events at each node), and that we do not need a physical network to start with.
Our method is massively parallelizable, allowing for its use to infer the
influence structure of large networks (~10,000 nodes). We demonstrate our
method for large networks using both synthetic and real-world email

significant mass transport, and that a substantial amount of water (about 10
times Earth's ocean mass for the initial planetesimal distribution based on the
minimum-mass solar nebula) was transported into the terrestrial planet region.
The total amount delivered increased further during Jupiter's migration phase
(totaling about 10-40 times Earth's ocean mass), which was less dependent on
simulation parameters. In addition, at these stages, terrestrial planets were
not fully grown. Therefore, water supplied during these early stages could
interact with metallic iron during the core formation of protoplanets and/or
growing Earth. Since hydrogen in water molecules can dissolve into their cores,
this could explain the density deficit observed in the current Earth core.
Notably, Jupiter could play an important role as a ''barrier'' in explaining

promise and elucidation with the application of graph learning approaches. In

between infinite-dimensional function spaces. With basic to deep neural network
architectures being data-driven, i.e. dependent on quality data for prediction,
neural operators provide robustness by offering generalization among different
resolutions despite low quality data. Graph neural operators are a variant that
utilize graph networks to learn this mapping between function spaces. The aim
of this research is to identify robust machine learning architectures that
integrate spatial information to predict tissue types. Under this notion, we

requires the sensors to have overlapping fields of view or necessitates the
construction of an environment map. Several existing techniques require bespoke
retroreflective radar targets. These requirements limit both where and how
calibration can be performed. In this paper, we take a different approach:
instead of attempting to track targets or features, we rely on ego-velocity

calibration of a subset of the transform parameters, including the yaw and the
axis of translation between the radar pair, without the need for a shared field
of view or for specialized targets. In general, the yaw and the axis of
translation are the most important parameters for data fusion, the most likely
to vary over time, and the most difficult to calibrate manually. We formulate
calibration as a batch optimization problem, show that the radar-radar system
is identifiable, and specify the platform excitation requirements. Through
simulation studies and real-world experiments, we establish that our method is
more reliable and accurate than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we
demonstrate that the full rigid body transform can be recovered if relatively

potential here deviates from the standard cosine nature due to the presence of
the two fermion masses $m_u$ and $m_d$ which couple to the ALP. The ALP is a
spectator field during inflation but it starts to oscillate and dominates the
energy density of the universe after inflation ends, thereby sourcing
isocurvature perturbations, while standard curvature fluctuations form the
inflaton are assumed to be sub-dominant. Subsequently the ALP decays converting
the isocurvature perturbations to adiabatic perturbations thereby acting as the
origin of the primordial density perturbations. We identify the parameter space
involving the axion decay constant $f_a$, scale of confinement $\Lambda$, ALP
mass $m$ and the masses of the fermions, $m_u$ and $m_d$ where it can
satisfactorily behave as the curvaton and source the observed primordial
density perturbation. We also predict local non-Gaussianity signals for
bi-spectrum and tri-spectrum $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$, as a function of the ratio
$m_u/m_d$, which are within the allowed range in the latest Planck observations
and are detectable with future observations. Particularly we observed that the
value of $f_{NL}$ and $g_{NL}$ are dependent on the ratio of $m_u$ and $m_d$:
$f_{NL}$ is more or less positive for all scenarios except $m_u = m_d$ and
$g_{NL}$ is always positive irrespective of the ratio between $m_u$ and $m_d$.
The results of our analysis in the limit $m_u = m_d$ resembles vanilla curvaton

transition in bulk semiconductors by obtaining the transition density as a
function of compensation, assuming that the transition is an Anderson
localization transition controlled by the Ioffe-Regel-Mott (IRM) criterion. We
calculate the mean free path, on the highly doped metallic side, arising from
carrier scattering by the ionized dopants, which we model as quenched random
charged impurities. The Coulomb disorder of the charged dopants is screened by
the carriers themselves, leading to an integral equation for localization,
defined by the density-dependent mean free path being equal to the inverse of
the Fermi wave number, as dictated by the IRM criterion. Solving this integral
equation approximately analytically and exactly numerically, we provide
detailed results for the localization critical density for the doping induced
metal-insulator transition.

been shown to occur in lattice gauge theories in the quench dynamics of initial
states spanning an extensive number of gauge superselection sectors. Whether
DFL is intrinsically a quantum interference effect or can arise classically has
hitherto remained an open question whose resolution is pertinent to further
understanding the far-from-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories. In this
work, we utilize cellular automaton circuits to model the quench dynamics of
large-scale quantum link model (QLM) formulations of $(1+1)$D quantum
electrodynamics, showing excellent agreement with the exact quantum case for
small system sizes. Our results demonstrate that DFL persists in the
thermodynamic limit as a purely classical effect arising from the finite-size
regularization of the gauge-field operator in the QLM formulation, and that
quantum interference, though not a necessary condition, may be employed to
enhance DFL.

renormalization group and random-phase approximation calculations that provide
a unified explanation for the superconducting mechanism in both cases. Both

can be explored by computing the corresponding polarization density matrix. To
this end, we consider the Higgs boson decays $H\to W W^*$ and $H\to Z Z^*$, in
which $W^*$ and $Z^*$ are off-shell states, and the $WW$, $WZ$ and $ZZ$
di-boson production in proton collisions. The polarization density matrix of
the di-boson state is determined by the amplitude of the production process and
can be experimentally reconstructed from the angular distribution of the
momenta of the charged leptons into which the gauge boson decays. We show that
a suitable instance of the Bell inequality is violated in $H\to Z Z^*$ to a
degree that can be tested at the LHC with future data. The same Bell inequality
is violated in the production of $WW$ and $ZZ$ boson pairs for invariant masses
above 900 GeV and scattering angles close to $\pi/2$ in the center of mass
frame. LHC data in this case are not sufficient to establish the violation of
the Bell inequality. We also analyze the prospects for detecting Bell
inequality violations in di-boson final states at future $e^+e^-$ and muon
colliders. A further observable that provides a lower bound on the amount of
polarization entanglement in the di-boson system is computed for each of the
examined processes. The analytic expressions for the polarization density
matrices are presented in full in an Appendix. We also provide the unitary
matrices required in the optimization procedure necessary in testing the Bell
inequalities.

formation and subsequent growth of axion stars at the cores of these halos. If,
like the QCD axion, the axion-like particle has attractive self-interactions
there is a maximal mass for these stars, above which the star rapidly shrinks
and converts an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ fraction of its mass into unbound relativistic
axions. This process would leave a similar (although in principle distinct)
signature in cosmological observables as a decaying dark matter fraction, and
thus is strongly constrained. We place new limits on the properties of

  quasiperiodic crystal",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic states in quasiperiodic crystals generally preclude a Bloch
description, rendering them simultaneously fascinating and enigmatic. Owing to
their complexity and relative scarcity, quasiperiodic crystals are
underexplored relative to periodic and amorphous structures. Here, we introduce
a new type of highly tunable quasiperiodic crystal easily assembled from
periodic components. By twisting three layers of graphene with two different
twist angles, we form two moir\'e patterns with incommensurate moir\'e unit
cells. In contrast to many common quasiperiodic structures that are defined on
the atomic scale, the quasiperiodicity in our system is defined on moir\'e
length scales of several nanometers. This novel ""moir\'e quasiperiodic crystal""
allows us to tune the chemical potential and thus the electronic system between
a periodic-like regime at low energies and a strongly quasiperiodic regime at
higher energies, the latter hosting a large density of weakly dispersing
states. Interestingly, in the quasiperiodic regime we observe superconductivity
near a flavor-symmetry-breaking phase transition, the latter indicative of the
important role electronic interactions play in that regime. The prevalence of
interacting phenomena in future systems with in situ tunability is not only
useful for the study of quasiperiodic systems, but it may also provide insights
into electronic ordering in related periodic moir\'e crystals. We anticipate
that extending this new platform to engineer quasiperiodic crystals by varying
the number of layers and twist angles, and by using different two-dimensional
components, will lead to a new family of quantum materials to investigate the
properties of strongly interacting quasiperiodic crystals.

is expected to be very competitive for cosmological studies. Using
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations, we present systematic analyses
simulating the expected weak lensing profiles from clusters in a variety of
dynamic states and at wide range of redshifts. In order to derive cluster
masses, we use a model consistent with the implementation within the Euclid
Consortium of the dedicated processing function and find that, when jointly
modelling mass and the concentration parameter of the Navarro-Frenk-White halo
profile, the weak lensing masses tend to be, on average, biased low with
respect to the true mass. Using a fixed value for the concentration, the mass
bias is diminished along with its relative uncertainty. Simulating the weak
lensing signal by projecting along the directions of the axes of the moment of
inertia tensor ellipsoid, we find that orientation matters: when clusters are
oriented along the major axis the lensing signal is boosted, and the recovered
weak lensing mass is correspondingly overestimated. Typically, the weak lensing
mass bias of individual clusters is modulated by the weak lensing
signal-to-noise ratio, and the negative mass bias tends to be larger toward
higher redshifts. However, when we use a fixed value of the concentration
parameter the redshift evolution trend is reduced. These results provide a
solid basis for the weak-lensing mass calibration required by the cosmological
application of future cluster surveys from Euclid and Rubin.

physical behaviors. Their peculiarity stems from the many active extrinsic
mechanisms that contribute to their properties and from a continuously growing
number of novel intrinsic features. Partly because of their unconventional
nature, basic questions about these materials remain open, and there are
inconsistencies between common theoretical assumptions and experimental
evidence. Aided by first-principles simulations, here we show that many of
hafnia's puzzles can be resolved by adopting an original high-symmetry
reference phase as the starting point of the analysis. The proposed theory
describes hafnia as a proper uniaxial ferroelectric that is not ferroelastic,
correcting previous discrepancies with experiment while confirming key
observations, such as the weak tendency of ferroelectric domains to grow. Our
approach also provides a straightforward and unified description of all
low-energy polymorphs, shedding light into old questions (e.g., the prevalence
of the monoclinic ground state), pointing at exciting possibilities (e.g., an
antiferroelastic behavior) and facilitating the future development of
perturbative theories (from Landau to second-principles potentials). Our work
thus yields a consistent and deeper understanding of hafnia ferroelectrics,
improving our ability to optimize their properties and induce new ones.

to satisfy an area law, with a constant correction term known as the

universal value that characterizes the underlying topological phase. However,
the TEE is not truly universal: it can differ even for two states related by
constant-depth circuits, which are necessarily in the same phase. The
difference between the TEE and the value predicted by the anyon theory is often
called the spurious topological entanglement entropy. We show that this
spurious contribution is always nonnegative, thus the value predicted by the
anyon theory provides a universal lower bound. This observation also leads to a
definition of TEE which is invariant under constant-depth quantum circuits.

environments of $\sim 1.4$ million WISE-selected obscured and unobscured
quasars at $\langle z \rangle = 1.4$ using angular clustering measurements as
well as cross-correlation measurements of quasar positions with the
gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We interpret
these signals within a halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework to conclude
that obscured systems reside in more massive effective halos ($ \sim 10^{12.9}
h^{-1} M_{\odot}$) than their unobscured counterparts ($ \sim 10^{12.6} h^{-1}

find excellent agreement between the clustering and lensing analyses and show
that this implies the observed difference is robust to uncertainties in the
obscured quasar redshift distribution, highlighting the power of combining
angular clustering and weak lensing measurements. This finding appears in
tension with models that ascribe obscuration exclusively to orientation of the
dusty torus along the line-of-sight, and instead may be consistent with the
notion that some obscured quasars are attenuated by galaxy-scale or
circumnuclear material during an evolutionary phase.

two cores remain surrounded by a common envelope and the decrease of the
orbital period $P_\text{orb}$ stalls. The subsequent evolution has never been
systematically explored with multidimensional simulations. For this study, we
performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of an envelope evolving under the
influence of a central binary star using an adaptively refined spherical grid.
We followed the evolution over hundreds of orbits of the central binary to
characterize the transport of angular momentum by advection, gravitational
torques, turbulence, and viscosity. We find that local advective torques from
the mean flow and Reynolds stresses associated with the turbulent flow dominate
the angular momentum transport, which occurs outward in a disk-like structure
about the orbital plane and inward along the polar axis. Turbulent transport is
less efficient, but can locally significantly damp or enhance the net angular
momentum radial transport and may even reverse its direction. Short-term
variability in the envelope is remarkably similar to circumbinary disks,
including the formation and destruction of lump-like overdensities, which
enhance mass accretion and contribute to the outward transport of eccentricity
generated in the vicinity of the binary. If the accretion onto the binary is
allowed, the orbital decay timescale settles to a nearly constant value
$\tau_\text{b} \sim 10^3$ to $10^4\,P_\text{orb}$, while preventing accretion
leads to a slowly increasing $\tau_\text{b} \sim 10^5\,P_\text{orb}$ at the end
of our simulations. Our results suggest that the post-dynamical orbital
contraction and envelope ejection will slowly continue while the binary is
surrounded by gas and that $\tau_\text{b}$ is often much shorter than the
thermal timescale of the envelope.

Our model assumes (total) pressure equilibrium with the ambient warm/hot CGM,
photoionization by the metagalactic radiation field, and allows for non-thermal
pressure support, parametrized by the ratio of thermal pressures, $\eta =
P_{\rm hot,th}/P_{\rm cool,th}$. We apply the model to the COS-Halos data set

corresponding to a volume filling fraction of $f_{\rm V,cool} \approx 1\%$,
reproduces the mean measured column densities of HI and low/intermediate metal
ions (CII, CIII, SiII, SiIII, MgII). Variation of $\pm 0.5$ dex in the
non-thermal pressure or gas mass encompasses $\sim 2/3$ of the scatter between
objects. Our nominal model underproduces the measured CIV and SiIV columns, and
we show these can be reproduced with (i) a cool phase with $M_{\rm cool}

component at intermediate temperatures, of cooling or mixing gas, with $M
\approx 1.5 \times 10^{10}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and occupying $\sim 1/2$ of the
total CGM volume. For cool gas with $f_{\rm V,cool} \approx 1\%$ we provide an
upper limit on the cloud sizes, $R_{\rm cl} \lesssim 0.5$ kpc. Our results
suggest that for the average galaxy CGM, the mass and non-thermal support in
the cool phase are lower than estimated in previous works, and extreme
scenarios for galactic feedback and non-thermal support may not be necessary.
We estimate the rates of cool gas depletion and replenishment, and find
accretion onto the galaxy can be entirely offset by condensation, outflows, and
IGM accretion, allowing $\dot{M}_{\rm cool}\sim0$ over long timescales.

high-redshift (z > 2) black hole mergers using the very large volume Astrid
cosmological simulation, which uses a range of seed masses to probe down to
low-mass BHs, and directly incorporates dynamical friction so as to accurately
model the dynamical processes which bring black holes to the galaxy center

in Astrid include black holes down to 10$^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$, and remain broadly
consistent with the TNG simulations at scales > 10$^6$ M$_\odot$ (the seed mass
used in TNG). By resolving lower-mass black holes, the overall merger rate is
~5x higher than in TNG. However, incorporating dynamical friction delays
mergers compared to a recentering scheme, reducing the high-z merger rate
mass-matched mergers by a factor of ~2x. We also calculate the expected LISA
Signal-to-Noise values, and show that the distribution peaks at high SNR

that the best strategy for deep ensembles is utilizing more accurate, but

We used a three-pronged approach to capture a nuanced picture of cognitive

focusing on the $m$-regular partition functions $b_m$ for $m$ even. Based on
extensive computational evidence, we propose an elegant conjecture which, in
particular, completely classifies such densities: Let $m = 2^j m_0$ with $m_0$
odd. If $2^j < m_0$, then the odd density of $b_m$ is $1/2$; moreover, such
density is equal to $1/2$ on every (nonconstant) subprogression $An+B$. If $2^j
> m_0$, then $b_m$, which is already known to have density zero, is identically
even on infinitely many non-nested subprogressions. This and all other
conjectures of this paper are consistent with our ''master conjecture'' on
eta-quotients presented in the previous work.
  In general, our results on $b_m$ for $m$ even determine behaviors
considerably different from the case of $m$ odd. Also interesting, it
frequently happens that on subprogressions $An+B$, $b_m$ matches the parity of
the multipartition functions $p_t$, for certain values of $t$. We make a
suitable use of Ramanujan-Kolberg identities to deduce a large class of such
results; as an example, $b_{28}(49n+12) \equiv p_3(7n+2) \pmod{2}$. Additional
consequences are several ''almost always congruences'' for various $b_m$, as
well as new parity results specifically for $b_{11}$.
  We wrap up our work with a much simpler proof of the main result of a recent

  The ordinary Grothendieck construction over a small category C is a

that the Grothendieck construction over a small tight bipermutative category D
is a pseudo symmetric Cat-multifunctor that is generally not a Cat-multifunctor

prove that the Grothendieck construction over D lifts to a non-symmetric
Cat-multiequivalence whose codomain is a non-symmetric Cat-multicategory with
small permutative opfibrations over D as objects.
  As applications we show that inverse K-theory, from Gamma-categories to small
permutative categories, is a pseudo symmetric Cat-multifunctor but not a
Cat-multifunctor in the symmetric sense. It follows that inverse K-theory
preserves algebraic structures parametrized by non-symmetric and pseudo
symmetric Cat-multifunctors but not Cat-multifunctors in general. As a special

E-infinity-algebras in Gamma-categories to pseudo symmetric E-infinity-algebras

processors to reduce the effective memory access time. Unfortunately, they are
also the prime targets for attacks on computer processors because they are
high-bandwidth and reliable side or covert channels for leaking secrets.
Conventional cache timing attacks typically leak secret encryption keys, while
recent speculative execution attacks typically leak arbitrary
illegally-obtained secrets through cache timing channels. While many hardware
defenses have been proposed for each class of attacks, we show that those for
conventional (non-speculative) cache timing channels do not work for all
speculative execution attacks, and vice versa. We maintain that a cache is not
secure unless it can defend against both of these major attack classes.
  We propose a new methodology and framework for covering such relatively large
attack surfaces to produce a Speculative and Timing Attack Resilient (STAR)
cache subsystem. We use this to design two comprehensive secure cache
architectures, STAR-FARR and STAR-NEWS, that have very low performance
overheads of 5.6% and 6.8%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these

It can also be extended to other attack classes and hardware systems.
Additionally, we also highlight the intrinsic security and performance benefits
of a randomized cache like a real Fully Associative cache with Random

Reliable and economical haptic feedback could fill this perception gap and

enables the operator to feel them in real time. Accurate haptic transmission
was achieved by optimizing the positions of the system's off-the-shelf

gives rise to derivative logics, also referred to as d-logics. Unlike logics
based on the topological closure operator, d-logics have not previously been
studied in the framework of dynamic topological systems (DTSs), which are pairs
(X,f) consisting of a topological space X equipped with a continuous function f
: X -> X. We introduce the logics wK4C, K4C and GLC and show that they all have
the finite Kripke model property and are sound and complete with respect to the
d-semantics in this dynamical setting. We also prove a general result for the
case where f is a homeomorphism, which yields soundness and completeness for
the corresponding systems wK4H, K4H and GLH. Of special interest is GLC, which
is the d-logic of all DTSs based on a scattered space. We use the completeness
of GLC and the properties of scattered spaces to demonstrate the first sound
and complete dynamic topological logic in the original trimodal language. In
particular, we show that the version of DTL based on the class of scattered
spaces is finitely axiomatisable over the original language, and that the
natural axiomatisation is sound and complete.

learning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as
adversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model
may be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network
parameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a
clean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped
with a pre-designed pattern called ""trigger"". Unfortunately, it is difficult to
distinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the
trigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special
type of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its
similarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs
generated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model
than UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the
shortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.
We propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)
and reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on
345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the
injected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than
state-of-the-art methods.

that, regarding Fourier spectral methods for solving differential equations,
``[t]he virtues of the Fast Fourier Transform will continue to improve as the

attempts to further the virtue of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) as not only
bandwidth is pushed to its limits, but also the dimension of the problem.
Instead of using the traditional FFT however, we make a key substitution: a
high-dimensional, sparse Fourier transform (SFT) paired with randomized rank-1
lattice methods. The resulting sparse spectral method rapidly and automatically
determines a set of Fourier basis functions whose span is guaranteed to contain
an accurate approximation of the solution of a given elliptic PDE. This much
smaller, near-optimal Fourier basis is then used to efficiently solve the given
PDE in a runtime which only depends on the PDE's data compressibility and
ellipticity properties, while breaking the curse of dimensionality and
relieving linear dependence on any multiscale structure in the original
problem. Theoretical performance of the method is established herein with
convergence analysis in the Sobolev norm for a general class of non-constant
diffusion equations, as well as pointers to technical extensions of the
convergence analysis to more general advection-diffusion-reaction equations.
Numerical experiments demonstrate good empirical performance on several
multiscale and high-dimensional example problems, further showcasing the
promise of the proposed methods in practice.

used as proxies for physical experiments, which can be infeasible or unethical.
Such simulations can often be computationally expensive, and an emulator can be
trained to efficiently predict the desired response surface. A widely-used
emulator is the Gaussian process (GP), which provides a flexible framework for
efficient prediction and uncertainty quantification. Standard GPs, however, do
not capture structured sparsity on the underlying response surface, which is
present in many applications, particularly in the physical sciences. We thus
propose a new hierarchical shrinkage GP (HierGP), which incorporates such
structure via cumulative shrinkage priors within a GP framework. We show that
the HierGP implicitly embeds the well-known principles of effect sparsity,
heredity and hierarchy for analysis of experiments, which allows our model to
identify structured sparse features from the response surface with limited
data. We propose efficient posterior sampling algorithms for model training and
prediction, and prove desirable consistency properties for the HierGP. Finally,
we demonstrate the improved performance of HierGP over existing models, in a
suite of numerical experiments and an application to dynamical system recovery.

relations, and show how they are interrelated and how they may be classified.
This leads to sequences defined by cubic $k$-term recurrence relations. The

elliptic functions to alternative bases, while the cases corresponding to $k=3$
correspond to the Ap\'ery, Domb, Almkvist--Zudilin numbers and other sequences

  We conduct a detailed analysis for the case $k=4$. Some of the sequences that
arise are new. Of particular interest are ten sequences that are said to be
self-starting in the sense that a single initial condition is enough to start
the recurrence relation. Of additional interest are two sequences which take
values in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ and two others with values in $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$.
Congruence properties and asymptotic expansions for the ten self-starting
sequences are investigated and several conjectures are presented. For example,
we conjecture that the integer-valued sequence defined by the recurrence
relation \begin{align*} (n+1)^3T(n+1) &=2(2n+1)(5n^2+5n+2)T(n) \\ &\qquad
-8n(7n^2+1)T(n-1)+22n(2n-1)(n-1)T(n-2) \end{align*} and initial condition

sequence is conjectured to satisfy the supercongruence $$ T(pn) \equiv T(n)

stochastic dynamical system exit the basin of attraction of a fixed point is
specifically challenging when a periodic orbit forms the boundary of the basin
of attraction. Our contention is that there is a distinguished Most Probable
Escape Path (MPEP) crossing the periodic orbit which acts as a guide for noisy
escaping paths in the case of small noise slightly away from the limit of
vanishing noise. It is well known that, before exiting, noisy trajectories will
tend to cycle around the periodic orbit as the noise vanishes, but we observe
that the escaping paths are stubbornly resistant to cycling as soon as the
noise becomes at all significant. Using a geometric dynamical systems approach,
we isolate a subset of the unstable manifold of the fixed point in the
Euler-Lagrange system, which we call the River. Using the Maslov index we
identify a subset of the River which is comprised of local minimizers. The
Onsager-Machlup (OM) functional, which is treated as a perturbation of the
Friedlin-Wentzell functional, provides a selection mechanism to pick out a
specific MPEP. Much of the paper is focused on the system obtained by reversing
the van der Pol Equations in time (so-called IVDP). Through Monte-Carlo
simulations, we show that the prediction provided by OM-selected MPEP matches
closely the escape hatch chosen by noisy trajectories at a certain level of

with the best-performing method achieving an accuracy of 57%. A new dataset
containing spoken captions in Yoruba language is also collected and released
for cross-lingual keyword localisation. The cross-lingual model obtains a
precision of 16% in actual keyword localisation and this performance can be
improved by initialising from a model pretrained on English data. The study
presents a detailed analysis of the model's success and failure modes and
highlights the challenges of using VGS models for keyword localisation in

isotropic noise have been extensively studied. However, the isotropic noise
assumption is very restrictive: (a) when adding noise to existing learning
algorithms to preserve privacy and maintain the best possible accuracy one
should take into account the relative magnitude of the outputs and their
correlations; (b) popular algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (and
their continuous time limits) appear to possess anisotropic covariance
properties. To study the privacy risks for the anisotropic noise case, one
requires general results on the relative entropy between the laws of two
Stochastic Differential Equations with different drifts and diffusion
coefficients. Our main contribution is to establish such a bound using
stability estimates for solutions to the Fokker-Planck equations via functional
inequalities. With additional assumptions, the relative entropy bound implies
an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy bound. We discuss the practical
implications of our bound related to privacy risk in different
contexts.Finally, the benefits of anisotropic noise are illustrated using
numerical results on optimising a quadratic loss or calibrating a neural

across different hosts, cell-lines, and labs into the cellular effects induced
by aneuploidy have conflicted, ranging from small, chaotic global changes to
large instances of either overexpression or underexpression throughout the
trisomic chromosome. We ascertained that conflicting findings may be correct
but miss the overarching ground truth due to careless use of thresholds. To
correct this deficiency, we introduce the Meta-analytic Operation of
Threshold-independent Filtering (MOTiF) method, which begins by providing a
panoramic view of all thresholds, transforms the data to eliminate the effects
accounted for by known mechanisms, and then reconstructs an explanation of the
mechanisms that underly the difference between the baseline and the
uncharacterized effects observed. As a proof of concept, we applied MOTiF to
human colonic epithelial cells, discovering a uniform decrease in gene
expression levels throughout the genome, which while significant, is beneath
most common thresholds. Using Hi-C data we identified the structural correlate,
wherein the physical genomic architecture condenses, compactifying in a
uniform, genome-wide manner, which we hypothesize is a robustness mechanism
counteracting the addition of a chromosome. We were able to decompose the gene
expression alterations into three overlapping mechanisms: the raw chromosome
content, the genomic compartmentalization, and the global structural
condensation. While further studies must be conducted to corroborate the
hypothesized robustness mechanism, MOTiF presents a useful meta-analytic tool

human-comprehensible, easy to analyze and can be helpful in explaining the

models from data in the form of analytic expressions. Historically, symbolic
regression has been predominantly realized using genetic programming, a method
that iteratively evolves a population of candidate solutions that are sampled
by genetic operators crossover and mutation. This gradient-free evolutionary
approach suffers from several deficiencies: it does not scale well with the
number of variables and samples in the training data, models tend to grow in
size and complexity without an adequate accuracy gain, and it is hard to
fine-tune the inner model coefficients using just genetic operators. Recently,
neural networks have been applied to learn the whole analytic formula, i.e.,
its structure as well as the coefficients, by means of gradient-based
optimization algorithms. We propose a novel neural network-based symbolic
regression method that constructs physically plausible models based on limited
training data and prior knowledge about the system. The method employs an
adaptive weighting scheme to effectively deal with multiple loss function terms

poor local optima. Furthermore, we propose a parameter-free method for choosing
the model with the best interpolation and extrapolation performance out of all

the approach on the TurtleBot 2 mobile robot, the magnetic manipulation system,

However, this assumption often does not hold in practice, e.g. a mobile robot

requires gradual deceleration to a full stop that takes time. In other words,
the robot is subject to kinodynamic constraints. Unfortunately, as we show in

introduce a novel variant of SIPP that is provably complete and optimal for

such as the Standard Model and a dark sector, with some interaction between
them. In this work, we initiate the study of a qualitatively different setup in
which one of the sectors is a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). Instead
of particles, the physics of a TQFT only manifests itself in non-trivial
spacetime topologies. Topological defects provide a natural place to
investigate such effects. In particular, we consider two possible ways in which
axionic cosmic strings can interact with a Zn TQFT. One of them, by extending
the structure of the axion coupling, leads to specific predictions for the
localized degrees of freedom on the cosmic string, which can in turn effect
their evolution and leave observable signals. The second approach, by gauging a
discrete subgroup of the axionic shift symmetry, leads to dramatic changes in
the string spectrum. We stress that the scenario considered here should be
regarded as a plausible way for new physics to arise since it can be the low
energy effective field theory for quite generic scenarios at high energies. To
demonstrate this point and further illustrate the physical implications, we
constructed such UV completions for both of the cases of couplings to TQFTs.
The detailed prediction for observable signals of such scenarios needs further
investigation. At the same time, our results demonstrate that there are rich
new phenomena in this scenario.

dark matter properties, structure formation, and baryonic feedback. When

more than $2\sigma$ level for both KiDS and DES, where reconstructed HMF from
these posteriors give a $48.8\%^{+8.3\%}_{-9.4\%}$ lower for KiDS-1000 and a
$29.5\%^{+8.5\%}_{-8.5\%}$ lower for DES-y3 in terms of total halo mass larger
than $M_\mathrm{Halo} > 10^{14} M_\odot$ compared to a canonical HMF model. In

changes in the rate of displacement with which a slope is deforming. This
information can then be used to predict the timing or probability of an
imminent failure in order to provide an early warning. In this study, a more
objective, statistical-learning algorithm is proposed to detect and
characterise the risk of a slope failure, based on spectral analysis of
serially correlated displacement time series data. The algorithm is applied to
satellite-based interferometric synthetic radar (InSAR) displacement time

risk of failure is detected as early as at least five months prior to the dam
collapse on 25 January 2019. The results of this study demonstrate that the
combination of spectral methods and second order statistical properties of

unstable deformation regime, and that this algorithm can provide sufficient
early warning that could help mitigate catastrophic slope failures.

are relevant to a single disease such as melanoma. In dermatology, skin disease
is described using an established clinical lexicon that allows clinicians to
describe physical exam findings to one another. To provide a medical dataset
densely annotated by domain experts with annotations useful across multiple
disease processes, we developed SkinCon: a skin disease dataset densely
annotated by dermatologists. SkinCon includes 3230 images from the Fitzpatrick
17k dataset densely annotated with 48 clinical concepts, 22 of which have at
least 50 images representing the concept. The concepts used were chosen by two
dermatologists considering the clinical descriptor terms used to describe skin
lesions. Examples include ""plaque"", ""scale"", and ""erosion"". The same concepts
were also used to label 656 skin disease images from the Diverse Dermatology
Images dataset, providing an additional external dataset with diverse skin tone
representations. We review the potential applications for the SkinCon dataset,
such as probing models, concept-based explanations, and concept bottlenecks.
Furthermore, we use SkinCon to demonstrate two of these use cases: debugging
mistakes of an existing dermatology AI model with concepts and developing
interpretable models with post-hoc concept bottleneck models.

classical Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The QNBM is able to outperform
this classical model on all distributions, even for the most optimally trained

Lastly, we conduct an initial investigation into the model's generalization

the ground truth probability distribution more closely than the training

forth a stronger case in support of using the QNBM for larger-scale generative

resistance to the modulator channel flow. In this way, the desired modulator
flow can be achieved, and channel over-filling can be avoided. Normally, the
length and the internal diameter of the bleed capillary are chosen so as to
obtain the modulator flow that is close to the flow of the first separation

advantage of the possibility to freely adapt the pressure resistance and
generate the required modulator channel flow for any conditions. This set-up

second line diagnostic tests on existing specimens based on the results of
initially ordered tests. Reflex testing can support optimal clinical laboratory
test ordering and diagnosis. In current clinical practice, reflex testing
typically relies on simple ""if-then"" rules; however, this limits their scope
since most test ordering decisions involve more complexity than a simple rule
will allow. Here, using the analyte ferritin as an example, we propose an
alternative machine learning-based approach to ""smart"" reflex testing with a
wider scope and greater impact than traditional rule-based approaches. Methods:
Using patient data, we developed a machine learning model to predict whether a
patient getting CBC testing will also have ferritin testing ordered, consider
applications of this model to ""smart"" reflex testing, and evaluate the model by
comparing its performance to possible rule-based approaches. Results: Our
underlying machine learning models performed moderately well in predicting
ferritin test ordering and demonstrated greater suitability to reflex testing
than rule-based approaches. Using chart review, we demonstrate that our model
may improve ferritin test ordering. Finally, as a secondary goal, we
demonstrate that ferritin test results are missing not at random (MNAR), a
finding with implications for unbiased imputation of missing test results.
Conclusions: Machine learning may provide a foundation for new types of reflex
testing with enhanced benefits for clinical diagnosis and laboratory

unsupervised method, which achieves EA without necessitating seed alignment.
DualMatch has two steps: (i) encoding temporal and relational information into

fusing both information and transforming it into alignment using a novel
graph-matching-based decoder, GM-Decoder. DualMatch is able to perform EA on

by orders of magnitude. We consider NACA airfoils as a test case for our
proposed approach, as their shape can be easily defined by the four-digit
parametrization. We successfully optimize the constrained NACA four-digit
problem with respect to maximizing the lift-to-drag ratio and validate all
results by comparing them to a high-order CFD solver. We find that DeepONets
have low generalization error, making them ideal for generating solutions of
unseen shapes. Specifically, pressure, density, and velocity fields are
accurately inferred at a fraction of a second, hence enabling the use of
general objective functions beyond the maximization of the lift-to-drag ratio

been an active research area in order to address many challenges originating

scheduling for manufacturing systems, the traditional off-line scheduling
techniques cannot always work well due to their lack of robustness with respect
to uncertainties coming from imprecise models or unexpected situations. On the
other hand, on-line scheduling or rescheduling, which can improve the
robustness by using the model and the latest measurements simultaneously,
suffer from a high computational cost. This work proposes a hybrid scheduling
framework, which combines the advantages of both off-line scheduling and
on-line scheduling, to provide a balanced solution between robustness and
computational cost. A novel concept of partially-dispatchable state is
introduced. It can be treated as a constant in scheduling when the model works
well. When the model does not work well, it is triggered as the variable to
tune to improve the performance. Such an event-triggered structure can reduce
the number of rescheduling and computational costs while achieving a reasonable
performance and enhancing system robustness. Moreover, the choice of
partially-dispatchable state also provides an extra design freedom in achieving
green manufacturing. Simulation examples on a manufacturing system, of which

Unfortunately, most existing works in value alignment tend to focus on issues
that are primarily related to the fact that reward functions are an unintuitive

matter is constructed with the parity doublet nucleon model coupled to scalar
fields $\sigma$, vector fields $(\omega, \rho)$, and to mesons with strangeness
through the U(1)$_A$ anomaly. In models with large $m_0$, the nucleon mass is
insensitive to the medium, and the nuclear saturation properties can be
reproduced without demanding strong couplings of nucleons to scalar fields
$\sigma$ and vector fields $\omega$. We confront the resulting nuclear
equations of state with nuclear constraints and neutron star observations, and
delineate the chiral invariant mass and effective interactions. To further
examine nuclear equations of state beyond the saturation density, we supplement
quark models to set the boundary conditions from the high density side. The
quark models are constrained by the two-solar mass conditions, and such
constraints are transferred to nuclear models through the causality and
thermodynamic stability conditions. We also calculate various condensates and
matter composition from nuclear to quark matter in a unified matter, by
constructing a generating functional that interpolates nuclear and quark matter
with external fields. Two types of chiral restoration are discussed; the one
due to the positive scalar charges of nucleons, and the other triggered by the
evolution of the Dirac sea. We found the U(1)$_A$ anomaly softens equations of

for fast numerical simulations of their horizontal chaotic motion and

develop a discrete model for walkers on an elliptical corral with two dominant
eigenmodes. These eigenmodes are excited periodically with each having random,

propulsion of the droplet due to impacts with the fluid bath. The propulsion is
calculated based on the interaction of the droplet with the wavefield produced

evaluating the causal effect of a hypothetical intervention in the possible
presence of confounding bias due to hidden factors. The approach is typically
used when both pre- and post-exposure outcome measurements are available, and
one can reasonably assume that the additive association of the unobserved
confounder with the outcome is equal in the two exposure arms, and constant
over time; a so-called parallel trends assumption. The parallel trends
assumption may not be credible in many practical settings, including if the
outcome is binary, a count, or polytomous, and more generally, when the
unmeasured confounder exhibits non-additive effects on the distribution of the
outcome, even if such effects are constant over time. We introduce an
alternative approach that replaces the parallel trends assumption with an odds
ratio equi-confounding assumption, which states that confounding bias for the
causal effect of interest, encoded by an association between treatment and the
potential outcome under no-treatment can be identified with a well-specified
generalized linear model relating the pre-exposure outcome and the exposure. As
the proposed method identifies any causal effect that is conceivably identified
in the absence of confounding bias, including nonlinear effects such as
quantile treatment effects, the approach is aptly called Universal
Difference-in-differences (UDiD). Both fully parametric and more robust
semiparametric UDiD estimators are described and illustrated in a real-world

This formalises mind-body dualism, in that a software ``mind'' can be run on

plausibility, a ``proxy for intelligence'' unrelated to compression or
simplicity. If hypotheses are evaluated in terms of weakness rather than

traditional massive MIMO (mMIMO) systems. However, these methods are not
efficient in extremely large-scale regimes due to the inherent spatial
non-stationarity and high computational complexity. To address this problem, we
investigate a low-complexity precoding algorithm, e.g., randomized Kaczmarz

Numerical results show that the complexity given by both rKA and SwoR-rKA

\emph{color degree} of $v$ in $G$, denoted by $d^c(v)$, is the number of colors
appearing on the edges incident with $v$. Denote by
$\delta^c(G)=\min\{d^c(v):v\in V(G)\}$. By a theorem of H. Li, an $n$-vertex
edge-colored graph $G$ contains a rainbow triangle if $\delta^c(G)\geq
\frac{n+1}{2}$. Inspired by this result, we consider two related questions
concerning edge-colored books and friendship subgraphs of edge-colored graphs.
Let $k\geq 2$ be a positive integer. We prove that if $\delta^c(G)\geq
\frac{n+k-1}{2}$ where $n\geq 3k-2$, then $G$ contains $k$ rainbow triangles
sharing one common edge; and if $\delta^c(G)\geq \frac{n+2k-3}{2}$ where $n\geq
2k+9$, then $G$ contains $k$ rainbow triangles sharing one common vertex. The
special case $k=2$ of both results improves H. Li's theorem. The main novelty
of our proof of the first result is a combination of the recent new technique
for finding rainbow cycles due to Czygrinow, Molla, Nagle, and Oursler and some
recent counting technique from \cite{LNSZ}. The proof of the second result is
with the aid of the machine implicitly in the work of Tur\'an numbers for

meta-learning in non-stationary environments. More specifically, we first
propose two simple but effective detection mechanisms of task switches and
distribution shift based on empirical observations, which serve as a key
building block for more elegant online model updates in our algorithm: the task
switch detection mechanism allows reusing of the best model available for the
current task at hand, and the distribution shift detection mechanism
differentiates the meta model update in order to preserve the knowledge for
in-distribution tasks and quickly learn the new knowledge for
out-of-distribution tasks. In particular, our online meta model updates are
based only on the current data, which eliminates the need of storing previous
data as required in most existing methods. We further show that a sublinear
task-averaged regret can be achieved for our algorithm under mild conditions.
Empirical studies on three different benchmarks clearly demonstrate the

in alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem by replaying examples from

between the current and prior tasks is also an urgent problem that should be
solved. In this work, we propose a new method, named Online Continual Learning

constrain the evolution of the embedding features via Knowledge Invariant and

successfully pre-trains deep models by learning to reconstruct the masked

time series is mainly contained in temporal variations, the standard way of
randomly masking a portion of time points will seriously ruin vital temporal
variations of time series, making the reconstruction task too difficult to

manifold learning, SimMTM proposes to recover masked time points by the
weighted aggregation of multiple neighbors outside the manifold, which eases
the reconstruction task by assembling ruined but complementary temporal
variations from multiple masked series. SimMTM further learns to uncover the
local structure of the manifold, which is helpful for masked modeling.
Experimentally, SimMTM achieves state-of-the-art fine-tuning performance

prediction in deep learning regression, the risk of wrong predictions can be
effectively controlled. High-quality PIs need to be as narrow as possible,
whilst covering a preset proportion of real labels. At present, many approaches
to improve the quality of PIs can effectively reduce the width of PIs, but they
do not ensure that enough real labels are captured. Inductive Conformal
Predictor (ICP) is an algorithm that can generate effective PIs which is
theoretically guaranteed to cover a preset proportion of data. However,
typically ICP is not directly optimized to yield minimal PI width. However, in
this study, we use Directly Optimized Inductive Conformal Regression (DOICR)
that takes only the average width of PIs as the loss function and increases the
quality of PIs through an optimized scheme under the validity condition that
sufficient real labels are captured in the PIs. Benchmark experiments show that
DOICR outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms for regression problems
using underlying Deep Neural Network structures for both tabular and image

people (silent) on the twitter's social network. Predicting the silent majority
remains a crucial yet challenging problem. However, most existing
message-passing based GNNs assume that all nodes belong to the same domain,
without considering the missing features and distribution-shift between
domains, leading to poor ability to deal with VS-Graph. To combat the above
challenges, we propose Knowledge Transferable Graph Neural Network (KT-GNN),
which models distribution shifts during message passing and representation
learning by transferring knowledge from vocal nodes to silent nodes.
Specifically, we design the domain-adapted ""feature completion and message

followed. Comprehensive experiments on real-world scenarios (i.e., company

situation where the input features dichotomize into two groups: explanatory

determine their effects. This dichotomy leads us to the contextual lasso, a new
statistical estimator that fits a sparse linear model to the explanatory

nonparametrically via a deep neural network. To attain sparse coefficients, we
train the network with a novel lasso regularizer in the form of a projection

achieving early practical quantum advantage - this has motivated the
development of a broad range of error mitigation techniques whose performance
generally improves when the quantum state is well approximated by a global
depolarising (white) noise model. While it has been crucial for demonstrating
quantum supremacy that random circuits scramble local noise into global white
noise - a property that has been proved rigorously - we investigate to what
degree practical shallow quantum circuits scramble local noise into global
white noise. We define two key metrics as (a) density matrix eigenvalue
uniformity and (b) commutator norm. While the former determines the distance
from white noise, the latter determines the performance of purification based
error mitigation. We derive analytical approximate bounds on their scaling and
find in most cases they nicely match numerical results. On the other hand, we
simulate a broad class of practical quantum circuits and find that white noise
is in certain cases a bad approximation posing significant limitations on the
performance of some of the simpler error mitigation schemes. On a positive
note, we find in all cases that the commutator norm is sufficiently small
guaranteeing a very good performance of purification-based error mitigation.
Lastly, we identify techniques that may decrease both metrics, such as
increasing the dimensionality of the dynamical Lie algebra by gate insertions
or randomised compiling.

realistic character animation, it is necessary to synthesize such interactions
between virtual characters and their surroundings. Despite recent progress in
character animation using machine learning, most systems focus on controlling
an agent's movements in fairly simple and homogeneous environments, with
limited interactions with other objects. Furthermore, many previous approaches
that synthesize human-scene interactions require significant manual labeling of
the training data. In contrast, we present a system that uses adversarial
imitation learning and reinforcement learning to train physically-simulated
characters that perform scene interaction tasks in a natural and life-like
manner. Our method learns scene interaction behaviors from large unstructured
motion datasets, without manual annotation of the motion data. These scene
interactions are learned using an adversarial discriminator that evaluates the
realism of a motion within the context of a scene. The key novelty involves
conditioning both the discriminator and the policy networks on scene context.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three challenging
scene interaction tasks: carrying, sitting, and lying down, which require
coordination of a character's movements in relation to objects in the
environment. Our policies learn to seamlessly transition between different
behaviors like idling, walking, and sitting. By randomizing the properties of
the objects and their placements during training, our method is able to
generalize beyond the objects and scenarios depicted in the training dataset,
producing natural character-scene interactions for a wide variety of object
shapes and placements. The approach takes physics-based character motion
generation a step closer to broad applicability.

Passing Neural Network (MPNN) usually fails in link prediction tasks, as it
only uses representations of two individual target nodes and ignores the

add manual features to the input graph and use the output of MPNN to produce
pairwise representations. In contrast, others directly use manual features as

with resampling}, which has been proposed for computing bootstrap statistics of
the elastic net estimator, we investigate when the bootstrap averaging reduces
the variance of the unbiased estimator and the effect of optimizing the size of
each bootstrap sample and hyperparameter of the elastic net regularization in
the asymptotic setting $M, N\to\infty, M/N\to\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. The results
indicate that bootstrap averaging effectively reduces the variance of the
unbiased estimator when the actual data generation process is inconsistent with
the sparsity assumption of the regularization and the sample size is small.
Furthermore, we find that when $w_0$ is less sparse, and the data size is
small, the system undergoes a phase transition. The phase transition indicates
the existence of the region where the ensemble average of unbiased estimators
of GAMP for the elastic net norm minimization problem yields the unbiased
estimator with the minimum variance.

  Graph Reasoning","EMNLP 2022 Full Paper",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reasoning over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) aims to predict future facts
based on given history. One of the key challenges for prediction is to learn
the evolution of facts. Most existing works focus on exploring evolutionary
information in history to obtain effective temporal embeddings for entities and
relations, but they ignore the variation in evolution patterns of facts, which
makes them struggle to adapt to future data with different evolution patterns.
Moreover, new entities continue to emerge along with the evolution of facts
over time. Since existing models highly rely on historical information to learn
embeddings for entities, they perform poorly on such entities with little
historical information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Temporal
Meta-learning framework for TKG reasoning, MetaTKG for brevity. Specifically,
our method regards TKG prediction as many temporal meta-tasks, and utilizes the
designed Temporal Meta-learner to learn evolutionary meta-knowledge from these
meta-tasks. The proposed method aims to guide the backbones to learn to adapt
quickly to future data and deal with entities with little historical
information by the learned meta-knowledge. Specially, in temporal meta-learner,
we design a Gating Integration module to adaptively establish temporal
correlations between meta-tasks. Extensive experiments on four widely-used
datasets and three backbones demonstrate that our method can greatly improve
the performance.

The magnetic driving injects energy into the system by spin rotation and the

spinor condensate evolves into a nonequilibrium steady state with
characteristic spin turbulence. Owing to the low energy scale of spin
excitations, the sample's lifetime is not significantly affected by magnetic
driving. We find that the spin composition of the stationary turbulent state
becomes isotropic at a driving strength comparable to the system's spin

The KST-Mixer extracts kinematic features and mix them along the spatial and

Language-Quantized AutoEncoder (LQAE), a modification of VQ-VAE that learns to

language models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Our main idea is to encode image as
sequences of text tokens by directly quantizing image embeddings using a
pretrained language codebook. We then apply random masking followed by a BERT
model, and have the decoder reconstruct the original image from BERT predicted
text token embeddings. By doing so, LQAE learns to represent similar images
with similar clusters of text tokens, thereby aligning these two modalities
without the use of aligned text-image pairs. This enables few-shot image
classification with large language models (e.g., GPT-3) as well as linear
classification of images based on BERT text features. To the best of our
knowledge, our work is the first work that uses unaligned images for multimodal
tasks by leveraging the power of pretrained language models.

local clients receive new categories consecutively under limited memory of
storing old categories. Moreover, some new local clients that collect novel
categories unseen by other clients may be introduced to the FL training
irregularly, which further exacerbates the catastrophic forgetting on old
categories. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Local-Global
Anti-forgetting (LGA) model to address local and global catastrophic forgetting
on old categories, which is a pioneering work to explore a global
class-incremental model in the FL feld. Specifcally, considering tackling class

gradient-induced semantic distillation loss. They can balance heterogeneous
forgetting speeds of hard-to-forget and easy-to-forget old categories, while
ensure intrinsic class relations consistency within different incremental

Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically

facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding
the history memory together with the current context with attention-based

Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like,

considerations, we propose a new algorithm named ""conditional
Distribution-based Imputation of Missing Values with Regularization"" (DIMV).
DIMV operates by determining the conditional distribution of a feature that has
missing entries, using the information from the fully observed features as a
basis. As will be illustrated via experiments in the paper, DIMV (i) gives a
low RMSE for the imputed values compared to state-of-the-art methods; (ii) fast
and scalable; (iii) is explainable as coefficients in a regression model,
allowing reliable and trustable analysis, makes it a suitable choice for
critical domains where understanding is important such as in medical fields,
finance, etc; (iv) can provide an approximated confidence region for the
missing values in a given sample; (v) suitable for both small and large scale
data; (vi) in many scenarios, does not require a huge number of parameters as
deep learning approaches; (vii) handle multicollinearity in imputation
effectively; and (viii) is robust to the normally distributed assumption that
its theoretical grounds rely on.

to originate due to Lense-Thirring precession of the accretion flow. Here we
report an analysis of one of the \emph{Insight}-HXMT observations of the black
hole transient MAXI J1820$+$070 taken near the flux peak of its hard spectral
state during which strong type-C LFQPOs were detected in all three instruments
up to photon energies above 150 keV. We obtained and analyzed the
short-timescale X-ray spectra corresponding to high- and low-intensity phases
of the observed LFQPO waveform with a spectral model composed of Comptonization
and disk reflection components. We found that the normalization of the spectral
model is the primary parameter that varied between the low and high-intensity
phases. The variation in the LFQPO flux at the hard X-ray band (> 100 keV) is
from the Compton component alone, while the energy-dependent variation in the
LFQPO flux at lower energies (< 30 keV) is mainly caused by the reflection
component with a large reflection fraction in response to the incident Compton
component. The observed X-ray LFQPOs thus should be understood as manifesting
the original timing signals or beats in the hard Compton component, which gives
rise to additional variability in softer energies due to disk reflection.

Recently, an efficient algorithm called QCS-SGM was proposed for quantized CS

Due to the adeptness of SGM in capturing the intricate structures of natural

QCS-SGM is constrained to (approximately) row-orthogonal sensing matrices as
the computation of the likelihood score becomes intractable otherwise. To
address this limitation, we introduce an advanced variant of QCS-SGM, termed
QCS-SGM+, capable of handling general matrices effectively. The key idea is a
Bayesian inference perspective on the likelihood score computation, wherein an
expectation propagation algorithm is employed for its approximate computation.
We conduct extensive experiments on various settings, demonstrating the
substantial superiority of QCS-SGM+ over QCS-SGM for general sensing matrices

These new detectors come with the promise of higher contrast-to-noise ratio and
spatial resolution and improved low-dose imaging. However, one important design
consideration is to build detector elements that are sufficiently homogeneous.
In practice, there will always be a degree of inhomogeneity in the detector
elements, which will materialize as variations in the energy bin thresholds.
Without proper detector calibration, this will lead to streak artifacts in the
sinograms and corresponding ring artifacts in the reconstructed images, which
limit their clinical usefulness. Since detector calibration is a time-consuming
process, having access to a fast ring correction technique may greatly improve
workflow. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based post-processing
technique for ring artifact correction in photon-counting spectral CT. We train
a UNet with a custom loss to correct for ring artifacts in the material basis
images. Our proposed loss is made ``task-aware'' by explicitly incorporating
the fact that we are working with spectral CT by combining a L1-loss operating
on the material basis images with a perceptual loss, using VGG16 as feature
extractor, operating on 70 keV virtual monoenergetic images. Our results
indicate that using this novel loss greatly improves performance. We
demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully produce ring corrected

success in many real-world applications. However, training GNNs on large-scale
graphs suffers from the well-known neighbor explosion problem, i.e., the
exponentially increasing dependencies of nodes with the number of message
passing layers. Subgraph-wise sampling methods -- a promising class of
mini-batch training techniques -- discard messages outside the mini-batches in
backward passes to avoid the neighbor explosion problem at the expense of
gradient estimation accuracy. This poses significant challenges to their
convergence analysis and convergence speeds, which seriously limits their
reliable real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
subgraph-wise sampling method with a convergence guarantee, namely Local
Message Compensation (LMC). To the best of our knowledge, LMC is the {\it

LMC is to retrieve the discarded messages in backward passes based on a message
passing formulation of backward passes. By efficient and effective
compensations for the discarded messages in both forward and backward passes,
LMC computes accurate mini-batch gradients and thus accelerates convergence. We
further show that LMC converges to first-order stationary points of GNNs.
Experiments on large-scale benchmark tasks demonstrate that LMC significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art subgraph-wise sampling methods in terms of

Cross-Immunity Protection Inference Model (DPCIPI) to predict the

this is through HI experiments, which are costly and time-consuming. The DPCIPI
model uses a pre-trained neural network to vectorize the gene sequences of
viruses and predicts the degree of cross-immunity between them. Method: The
paper describes the steps taken to develop the DPCIPI model. First, the gene
sequence of two viruses is converted into k-mers. Then, the k-mers sequences
are aligned, and identical k-mers at the exact position are deleted. The human
DNA pre-trained model (DNABERT) is used to vectorize each k-mer in the
remaining k-mers. This is followed using a BiLSTM encoder to encode the two
viruses into sequence representation and embeddings. An information fusion
operation is then performed on the two embeddings to obtain a splicing vector,
which is further input into a fully connected neural network for prediction.
All parameters of the model are trained simultaneously. Result: Binary
cross-immunity prediction predicts whether the HI titer between two viruses
exceeds a certain threshold (in our case, an HI titer measurement value higher
than 40). Compared with baseline methods such as Logistic Regression,
Perceptron, Decision Tree, and CNN-based models, DPCIPI achieves better
performance: F1 (88.14%), precision (90.40%), recall (89.69%), and accuracy
(89.69%). Multi-level cross-immunity prediction predicts different HI titer
intervals. Again, DPCIPI's performance surpasses baseline models. The study
concludes that DPCIPI has enormous potential for predicting the cross-immunity
between influenza virus strains.

generally, $\text{L}$-/$\text{L}^\natural$-convex function minimization have
arbitrarily many optimal solutions, making such prediction-dependent bounds
arbitrarily large. To resolve this theoretically critical issue, we present a

offers time complexity bounds proportional to the distance between a prediction

performance predictor to improve the sample efficiency. However,
predictor-based NAS suffers from the severe ``cold-start'' problem, since a
large amount of architecture-performance data is required to get a working
predictor. In this paper, we focus on exploiting information in
cheaper-to-obtain performance estimations (i.e., low-fidelity information) to
mitigate the large data requirements of predictor training. Despite the
intuitiveness of this idea, we observe that using inappropriate low-fidelity
information even damages the prediction ability and different search spaces
have different preferences for low-fidelity information types. To solve the
problem and better fuse beneficial information provided by different types of
low-fidelity information, we propose a novel dynamic ensemble predictor
framework that comprises two steps. In the first step, we train different
sub-predictors on different types of available low-fidelity information to
extract beneficial knowledge as low-fidelity experts. In the second step, we
learn a gating network to dynamically output a set of weighting coefficients
conditioned on each input neural architecture, which will be used to combine
the predictions of different low-fidelity experts in a weighted sum. The
overall predictor is optimized on a small set of actual
architecture-performance data to fuse the knowledge from different low-fidelity
experts to make the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across
five search spaces with different architecture encoders under various
experimental settings. Our method can easily be incorporated into existing
predictor-based NAS frameworks to discover better architectures.

recorded from frontal left, frontal right and occipital right cortical areas.
We employed a simple artificial neural network (ANN), in which the mean values
and standard deviations of ECoG signals from two or three channels were used as
inputs for the ANN. Results of wavelet-based recognition of BS/WS in the same
data were used to train the ANN and evaluate correctness of our classifier. We
tested different combinations of ECoG channels for detecting BS/WS.
  Our results showed that the accuracy of ANN classification did not depend on
ECoG-channel. For any ECoG-channel, networks were trained on one rat and
applied to another rat with an accuracy of at least 80~\%. Itis important that
we used a very simple network topology to achieve a relatively high accuracy of
classification. Our classifier was based on a simple linear combination of
input signals with some weights, and these weights could be replaced by the
averaged weights of all trained ANNs without decreases in classification
accuracy. In all, we introduce a new sleep recognition method that does not
require additional network training. It is enough to know the coefficients and
the equations suggested in this paper. The proposed method showed very fast
performance and simple computations, therefore it could be used in real time
experiments. It might be of high demand in preclinical studies in rodents that
require vigilance control or monitoring of sleep-wake patterns.

thus mitigating the potential issues such as destroying the useful behaviors of

has a blueshifted velocity of $\sim 148\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ and a full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of $\sim 581\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. The spatial extent and
kinematic properties of the HI outflow are consistent with the previously
detected cold molecular outflows in IRAS 10565+2448, suggesting that they
likely have the same driving mechanism and are tracing the same outflow. By
combining the multi-phase gas observations, we estimate a total outflowing mass
rate of at least $140\, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ and a total energy loss rate of
at least $8.9\times10^{42}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, where the contribution from the
ionised outflow is negligible, emphasising the importance of including both

threat to modern high-performance processors. They exploit the vulnerability of
speculative execution to illegally access private data, and transmit them
through timing-based covert channels. While new vulnerabilities are discovered
continuously, the covert channels can be categorised to two types: 1)
Persistent Type, in which covert channels are based on the layout changes of
buffering, e.g. through caches or TLBs; 2) Volatile Type, in which covert
channels are based on the contention of sharing resources, e.g. through
execution units or issuing ports. The defenses against the persistent-type
covert channels have been well addressed, while those for the volatile-type are
still rather inadequate. Existing mitigation schemes for the volatile type such
as Speculative Compression and Time-Division-Multiplexing will introduce
significant overhead due to the need to stall the pipeline or to disallow
resource sharing. In this paper, we look into such attacks and defenses with a
new perspective, and propose a scheduling-based mitigation scheme, called
SPECWANDS. It consists of three priority-based scheduling policies to prevent
an attacker from transmitting the secret in different contention situations.
SPECWANDS not only can defend against both inter-thread and intra-thread based
attacks, but also can keep most of the performance benefit from speculative
execution and resource-sharing. We evaluate its runtime overhead on SPEC 2017
benchmarks and realistic programs. The experimental results show that SPECWANDS
has a significant performance advantage over the other two representative
schemes.

household surveys. Recently proposed measures account for sexual activity
through assessment of the distribution of time-between-sex (TBS) in the
population of interest. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach to
estimate the distribution of TBS using data typically available in low- and
middle-income countries, while addressing two major challenges. The first
challenge is that timing of sex information is typically limited to women's
time-since-last-sex (TSLS) data collected in the cross-sectional survey. In our
proposed approach, we adopt the current duration method to estimate the
distribution of TBS using the available TSLS data, from which the frequency of
sex at the population level can be derived. Furthermore, the observed TSLS data
are subject to reporting issues because they can be reported in different units
and may be rounded off. To apply the current duration approach and account for
these data reporting issues, we develop a flexible Bayesian model, and provide
a detailed technical description of the proposed modeling approach.

Experiments show our QR-CLIP's effectiveness, and it outperforms the previous

from it in a diagnostic setting. Materials and Methods: The deep learning model
was developed with 1868 eligible NCCT scans with non-traumatic ICH collected
between January 2011 and April 2018. We tested the model on two independent
datasets (TT200 and SD 98) collected after April 2018. The model's diagnostic
performance was compared with clinicians's performance. We further designed a
simulated study to compare the clinicians's performance with and without the
deep learning system augmentation. Results: The proposed deep learning system
achieved area under the receiver operating curve of 0.986 (95% CI 0.967-1.000)

an independent dataset SD98. The clinicians achieve significant improvements in
the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of diagnoses of certain hemorrhage
etiologies with proposed system augmentation. Conclusions: The proposed deep
learning algorithms can be an effective tool for early identification of
hemorrhage etiologies based on NCCT scans. It may also provide more information

to mitigate the frequent oscillation for better BNNs' training. We identify
that the weight oscillation mainly stems from the non-parametric scaling
factor. To address this issue, we propose to parameterize the scaling factor
and introduce a weighted reconstruction loss to build an adaptive training
objective. For the first time, we show that the weight oscillation is
controlled by the balanced parameter attached to the reconstruction loss, which
provides a theoretical foundation to parameterize it in back propagation. Based
on this, we learn our ReBNN by calculating the balanced parameter based on its
maximum magnitude, which can effectively mitigate the weight oscillation with a
resilient training process. Extensive experiments are conducted upon various
network models, such as ResNet and Faster-RCNN for computer vision, as well as
BERT for natural language processing. The results demonstrate the overwhelming
performance of our ReBNN over prior arts. For example, our ReBNN achieves 66.9%

Hermitian symmetric space $\mathsf{Sp}(2n, {\mathbb R})/ \mathsf{U}(n)$. In the
presence of supergravity, this model is super-Weyl invariant and possesses the
maximal non-compact duality group $\mathsf{Sp}(2n, {\mathbb R})$ at the
classical level. These symmetries should be respected by the logarithmically
divergent term (the ``induced action'') of the effective action obtained by
integrating out the vector multiplets. In computing the effective action, one
has to deal with non-minimal operators for which the known heat kernel
techniques are not directly applicable, even in flat (super)space. In this
paper we develop a method to compute the induced action in Minkowski
superspace. The induced action is derived in closed form and has a simple
structure. It is a higher-derivative superconformal sigma model on

our perspective on several well-established computational notions. Correctness
is probably the most basic one. While a typical probabilistic program cannot be
said to compute the correct result, we often have quite strong expectations
about the frequency with which it should return certain outputs. In these
cases, trust as a generalisation of correctness fares better. One way to
understand it is to say that a probabilistic computational process is
trustworthy if the frequency of its outputs is compliant with a probability
distribution which models its expected behaviour. We present a formal
computational framework that formalises this idea. In order to do so, we define
a typed lambda-calculus that features operators for conducting experiments at
runtime on probabilistic programs and for evaluating whether they compute
outputs as determined by a target probability distribution. After proving some
fundamental computational properties of the calculus, such as progress and
termination, we define a static notion of confidence that allows to prove that
our notion of trust behaves correctly with respect to the basic tenets of

worldwide. Lack of sufficient resources to mitigate the disease-burden makes
the situation even more challenging for lower-income countries. Hence, strategy
development towards disease eradication and optimal management of the social
and economic burden has garnered a lot of attention in recent years. In this
context, we quantify the optimal fraction of resources that can be allocated to
two major intervention measures, namely reduction of disease transmission and
improvement of healthcare infrastructure. Our results demonstrate that the
effectiveness of each of the interventions has a significant impact on the
optimal resource allocation in both long-term disease dynamics and outbreak
scenarios. Often allocating resources to both strategies is optimal. For
long-term dynamics, a non-monotonic behavior of optimal resource allocation
with intervention effectiveness is observed which is different from the more
intuitive strategy recommended in case of outbreaks. Further, our result
indicates that the relationship between investment into interventions and the
corresponding outcomes has a decisive role in determining optimal strategies.
Intervention programs with decreasing returns promote the necessity for
resource sharing. Our study provides a fundamental insight into determining the
best response strategy in case of controlling epidemics under
resource-constrained situations.

under certain condition on the coefficients when even number of higher figurate

exploration approaches that require a long time to explore the entire building,

use of an existing 3D model we ensure that all surfaces of the building are

using the associated line bundle and the graded quotients of the monodromy
filtration. The earlier definition requiring a global defining function of $X$
can be applied rarely to projective hypersurfaces with non-isolated
singularities. Indeed, it is surprisingly difficult to get a one-parameter
smoothing with total space smooth without destroying the singularities by
blowing-ups (except certain quite special cases). As an application, assuming
the singular locus is a projective variety, we show that the minimal exponent
of a hypersurface can be captured by the spectral Hirzebruch-Milnor class, and
higher du Bois and rational singularities of a hypersurface are detectable by
the unnormalized Hirzebruch-Milnor class. Here the unnormalized class can be
replaced by the normalized one in the higher du Bois case, but for the higher
rational case, we must use also the decomposition of the Hirzebruch-Milnor
class by the action of the semisimple part of the monodromy (which is
equivalent to the spectral Hirzebruch-Milnor class)

necessary and sufficient conditions for attractiveness, through the
construction of a coupled process under which discrepancies do not increase. We
emphasize the fact that basic coupling is never attractive for this class of

systems, namely systems whose dynamics depends on the controls only. Trivial
systems have been introduced and studied by Serres in the the context of

begin by proposing an extension of the notion of triviality to control-affine
systems with arbitrary number of states and controls. Next, our first result
concerns two novel characterisations of trivial control-affine systems, one of
them is based on the study of infinitesimal symmetries and is thus geometric.
Second, we derive a normal form of trivial control-affine systems whose Lie
algebra of infinitesimal symmetries possesses a transitive almost abelian Lie
subalgebra. Third, we study and propose a characterisation of trivial
control-affine systems on $3$-dimensional manifolds with scalar control. In
particular, we give a novel proof of the previous characterisation obtained by
Serres. Our characterisation is based on the properties of two functional
feedback invariants: the curvature (introduced by Agrachev) and the
centro-affine curvature (used by Wilkens). Finally, we give several normal

understanding many body interacting systems. We study a system of dissipative
qubits with the Heisenberg interaction and obtain, for qubits under a certain
condition, an exact steady state solution to the Lindblad master equation
describing its dynamics. The physical content of such a solution is a
remarkable no-go theorem, which states that for qubits possessing identical
ratios of the damping and gain rates, no correlation can be established between
them in the steady state. Two consequences of this theorem are discussed in the
context of quantum synchronization of qubits. The first is a complete blockade
of quantum synchronization of qubits under the aforementioned condition, an
effect reminiscent of, but having a much broader scope than, that found in
dissipated Kerr-anharmonic oscillators. The second, and a more important
consequence is the possibility of reducing a complex all-to-all qubit network
to a much simpler one-to-all network by engineering the dissipation. Such a
reduction is desired because it provides an effective tool to optimize the
quantum synchronization of a complex qubit network. Finally, we propose two
concrete experimental schemes to implement our model and to test our

Considering conversational user interfaces, tremendous progress has already
been made in designing and evaluating task oriented conversational interfaces,
such as voice assistants for ordering food, booking a flight etc. However, it
is still very challenging to design smart things that can have with their users
an informal conversation and emotional exchange, which requires the smart thing
to master the usage of social everyday utterances, using irony and sarcasm,
delivering good compliments, etc. In this paper, we focus on the experience
design of compliments and the Complimenting Mirror design. The paper reports in
detail on three phases of a human-centered design process including a Wizard of
Oz study in the lab with 24 participants to explore and identify the effect of
different compliment types on user experiences and a consequent field study
with 105 users in an architecture museum with a fully functional installation

mirror should compliment users and provide a theorization applicable for
affective interaction design with things in more general. We focus on
subjective user feedback including user concerns and prepositions of receiving
compliments from a thing and on observations of real user behavior in the field
i.e. transitions of bodily affective expressions comparing affective user
states before, during, and after compliment delivery. Our research shows that
compliment design matters significantly and using the right type of compliments
in our final design in the field test, we succeed in achieving reactive
expressions of positive emotions, ""sincere"" smiles and laughter, even from the

safety perception in intelligent driving is growing. Conventional methods in
the robust perception of intelligent driving focus on training models with

However, these models cannot adapt smoothly to the diverse and complex
real-world environment. This paper proposes a new type of metric known as Eloss
and offers a novel training strategy to empower perception models from the
aspect of anomaly detection. Eloss is designed based on an explanation of the
perception model's information compression layers. Specifically, taking
inspiration from the design of a communication system, the information
transmission process of an information compression network has two
expectations: the amount of information changes steadily, and the information
entropy continues to decrease. Then Eloss can be obtained according to the
above expectations, guiding the update of related network parameters and
producing a sensitive metric to identify anomalies while maintaining the model
performance. Our experiments demonstrate that Eloss can deviate from the
standard value by a factor over 100 with anomalous data and produce distinctive
values for similar but different types of anomalies, showing the effectiveness
of the proposed method. Our code is available at: (code available after paper

information (CSI)-based Wi-Fi sensing can unleash game-changing applications in
many fields, such as healthcare, security, and entertainment. However, despite
one decade of active research on Wi-Fi sensing, most existing work only
considers legacy IEEE 802.11n devices, often in particular and
strictly-controlled environments. Worse yet, there is a fundamental lack of
understanding of the impact on CSI-based sensing of modern Wi-Fi features, such
as 160-MHz bandwidth, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions, and
increased spectral resolution in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6). This work aims to
shed light on the impact of Wi-Fi 6 features on the sensing performance and to
create a benchmark for future research on Wi-Fi sensing. To this end, we
perform an extensive CSI data collection campaign involving 3 individuals, 3
environments, and 12 activities, using Wi-Fi 6 signals. An anonymized ground
truth obtained through video recording accompanies our 80-GB dataset, which
contains almost two hours of CSI data from three collectors. We leverage our
dataset to dissect the performance of a state-of-the-art sensing framework
across different environments and individuals. Our key findings suggest that
(i) MIMO transmissions and higher spectral resolution might be more beneficial
than larger bandwidth for sensing applications; (ii) there is a pressing need
to standardize research on Wi-Fi sensing because the path towards a truly
environment-independent framework is still uncertain. To ease the experiments'
replicability and address the current lack of Wi-Fi 6 CSI datasets, we release
our 80-GB dataset to the community.

However, SOTA high-probability non-asymptotic convergence results are derived
under strong assumptions such as the boundedness of the gradient noise variance

algorithms with high-probability convergence results under less restrictive
assumptions. In particular, we derive new high-probability convergence results
under the assumption that the gradient/operator noise has bounded central
$\alpha$-th moment for $\alpha \in (1,2]$ in the following setups: (i) smooth
non-convex / Polyak-Lojasiewicz / convex / strongly convex / quasi-strongly

provides the residual content for lossless reconstruction of the original

characterised by vertical gradients in pressure arising from the warmer indoor
temperatures. Models usually assume that horizontal variations of temperature
difference are small in comparison and are, therefore, unimportant. Small-scale
laboratory experiments and computational fluid dynamics were used to examine
these flows, driven by a uniformly heated floor. These experiments and
simulations show that the horizontal variations of temperature difference can
be neglected for predictions of the bulk ventilation rate; however, they also
evidence that these horizontal variations can be significant and play a
critical role in establishing the pattern of flow within the room -- this
renders the horizontal position of the low- and high-level vents (relative to
one another) important. We consider two cases: single-ended (where inlet and
outlet are at the same end of the room) and opposite-ended. In both cases the
ventilation flow rate is the same. However, in the opposite-ended case a dead
zone is established in the upper part of the room which results in significant
horizontal variations. We consider the formation of this dead zone by examining
the streamline patterns and the age of air within the room. We discuss the

  (MMSP), Tampere, Finland, 2020, pp. 1-6",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient lossless coding of medical volume data with temporal axis can be
achieved by motion compensated wavelet lifting. As side benefit, a scalable bit
stream is generated, which allows for displaying the data at different
resolution layers, highly demanded for telemedicine applications. Additionally,
the similarity of the temporal base layer to the input sequence is preserved by
the use of motion compensated temporal filtering. However, for medical
sequences the overall rate is increased due to the specific noise
characteristics of the data. The use of denoising filters inside the lifting
structure can improve the compression efficiency significantly without
endangering the property of perfect reconstruction. However, the design of an
optimum filter is a crucial task. In this paper, we present a new method for
selecting the optimal filter strength for a certain denoising filter in a
rate-distortion sense. This allows to minimize the required rate based on a
single input parameter for the encoder to control the requested distortion of
the temporal base layer.

{down} the growth rate of Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in the capillary

equations in 2008. Motivated by their linear theory, we further investigate the
nonlinear RT problem for the 2D incompressible case in a horizontally periodic
slab domain with Navier boundary condition, and rigorously verify that the RT
instability can be inhibited by capillarity under our 2D setting. More
precisely, if the RT density profile $\bar{\rho}$ satisfies an additional
stabilizing condition, then there is a threshold $\kappa_{C}$ of capillarity
coefficient, such that if the capillarity coefficient $\kappa$ is bigger than
$\kappa_{C}$, then the small perturbation solution around the RT equilibrium
state is \emph{algebraically} stable in time. In particular, if the RT density
profile is linear, then the threshold $\kappa_{C}$ can be given by the formula
$\kappa_{C}=g /(\pi^2h^{-2}+L^{-2})\bar{\rho}'$, where $2\pi L$ denotes the
length of a periodic cell of the slab domain in the horizontal direction, and
$h$ the height of the slab domain. In addition, we also provide a nonlinear
instability result for $\kappa\in[0,\kappa_{C})$. The instability result
presents that the capillarity can not inhibit the RT instability, if its

a lot of ghosting artifacts. This can be alleviated by incorporating motion
compensation methods into the subband coder. This results in a high quality
lowpass subband but also leads to a lower compression ratio. In order to cope
with this, we introduce a new approach for improving the compression efficiency

We are able to reduce the file size of the lowpass subband by up to 1.64\%,

notation used to label tilt systems in perovskites. The key advantage of this
label in the context of $\textit{MX}_2$ systems is that it contains sufficient
information to generate the corresponding stacking sequences uniquely. Using a
related approach, we generate a Cartesian representation of the phase space
containing all possible $\textit{MX}_2$ polytypes, with the most common

composition, or temperature, or pressure) may allow navigation of this phase

with the structural evolution of stacking-faulted $\textit{MX}_2$ systems as a
function of temperature and composition. Our study highlights the potential for
controlling composition/structure/property relationships amongst layered

the core of various Eastern traditions. Neurocognitive and psychosomatic
phenomena demonstrated during such exercises were instrumentally explored with

visualization produced persistent temperature effects in the body long after
the exercise finished; this raises the question about their psychosomatic or
biophysical origin. The work explores this question by comparing experiments
with focusing attention inside and outside the body. EEG, temperature, heart
and breathing sensors monitor internal body conditions, high resolution
differential calorimetric sensors are used to detect thermal effects outside
the body. Experiments with 159 attempts (2427 operator-sensor sessions) were
carried over five months, control measurements run in the same conditions in
parallel to experimental series. Increase of body temperature up to moderate
fever zone 38.5 C and intentional control of up and down trend of core
temperature by 1.6 C are demonstrated. Persistent temperature variations last
>60 min. Experiments also demonstrated induced thermal fluctuations at 10^-3 C
level in external calorimetric systems with 15 ml of water for 60-90 min.
Repeatability of these attempts is over 90%, statistical Chi-square and
Mann-Whitney tests reject the null hypotheses about random character of
outcomes. Thus, the obtained data confirm the persistent thermal effects
reported in previous publications and indicate their biophysical dimension. To
explain these results we refer to a new model in neuroscience that involves
spin phenomena in biochemical and physical systems. These experiments
demonstrate complex biophysical mechanisms of altered states of consciousness;
their function in the body's neurohumoral regulation and non-classical brain

characterize anatomy and tissue. However, due to the heterogeneity of imaging
protocols and contra-indications to contrast agents, some MRI sequences, e.g.
contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (T1ce), may not be acquired. This creates
difficulties for large-scale clinical studies for which heterogeneous datasets
are aggregated. Modern deep learning techniques have demonstrated the
capability of synthesizing missing sequences from existing sequences, through
learning from an extensive multi-sequence MRI dataset. In this paper, we
propose a novel MR image translation solution based on local implicit neural
representations. We split the available MRI sequences into local patches and
assign to each patch a local multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that represents a
patch in the T1ce. The parameters of these local MLPs are generated by a
hypernetwork based on image features. Experimental results and ablation studies

recovering fine image and tumor details, as they allow for local specialization

significantly, therefore, dividing failures into distinct groups according to
the responsible faults is highly important. In such a failure indexing task,
the crux lies in the failure proximity, which involves two points, i.e., how to
effectively represent failures (e.g., extract the signature of failures) and
how to properly measure the distance between the proxies for those failures.
Existing studies have proposed a variety of failure proximities. The prevalent
of them extract signatures of failures from execution coverage or
suspiciousness ranking lists, and accordingly employ the Euclid or the Kendall
tau distances. However, such strategies may not properly reflect the essential
characteristics of failures, thus resulting in unsatisfactory effectiveness. In
this paper, we propose a new failure proximity, namely, program variable-based
failure proximity, and based on which present a novel failure indexing
approach. Specifically, the proposed approach utilizes the run-time values of
program variables to represent failures, and designs a set of rules to measure
the similarity between them. Experimental results demonstrate the
competitiveness of the proposed approach: it can achieve 44.12% and 27.59%
improvements in faults number estimation, as well as 47.30% and 26.93%

theory for general source resolution in the multi-illumination imaging problem.
Our main idea is to transform multi-illumination imaging into single-snapshot
imaging with a new imaging kernel that depends on both the illumination
patterns and the point spread function of the imaging system. We thus prove
that the resolution of multi-illumination imaging is approximately determined
by the essential cutoff frequency of the new imaging kernel, which is roughly
limited by the sum of the cutoff frequency of the point spread function and the
maximum essential frequency in the illumination patterns.
  Our theory provides a unified way to estimate the resolution of various
existing super-resolution modalities and results in the same estimates as those
obtained in experiments. In addition, based on the reformulation of the
multi-illumination imaging problem, we also estimate the resolution limits for
resolving both complex and positive sources by sparsity-based approaches. We
show that the resolution of multi-illumination imaging is approximately
determined by the new imaging kernel from our operator theory and better
resolution can be realized by sparsity-promoting techniques in practice but
only for resolving very sparse sources. This explains experimentally observed
phenomena in some sparsity-based super-resolution modalities.

channel in the form of a central axially-uniform depth reduction supports a
multitude of stable bubble formations in which bubbles lie in alternation on
opposite sides of the perturbation and retain constant separations as they
propagate. In all cases, a formation is led by the smallest of its constitutive
bubbles and the trailing bubbles can be arranged in any order. Hence, for a
group of $N$ bubbles, there are $(N-1)!$ stable formations. These steady
multi-bubble states arise because each of the trailing bubbles can decrease
their speed to that of the leading bubble through a reduction in the local
viscous dissipation, caused by an increase in the bubble's overlap of the
depth-reduced region. We find that such formations exist for depth
perturbations of less than $1\%$.

radiation pressure. These radiation-pressure-induced mechanical effects then
lead to the indirect coupling between two transverse mirrors, where
intra-cavity field mimics as a spring between two mechanical objects. By
computing Poincar\'e surface of sections for both mirrors over a wide interval

with mechanical drives, we measure the spatio-temporal responses of moving-end

the mirrors follow chaotic temporal evolution with external mechanical drives,
even in the absence of any one of the mechanical drives. To quantitatively
measure the occurrence of chaos, we computed the possible Lyapunov exponents

positive values with increase in external drives but also crucially depends on
the initial conditions chosen from the Poincar\'e surface of sections.
Furthermore, we show the enhancement in chaotic dynamics of mirrors in the

only recently been explored in detail (and become experimentally accessible) is
that of ultrastrong coupling between light and matter. Here, we study a system
which combines both phenomena, consisting of a two-impurity Anderson model
ultra-strongly coupled to a single-mode cavity. While presented as an abstract
model, it is relevant for a range of future hybrid cavity-QED systems. Using
the hierarchical equations of motion approach we show that the ultrastrong
coupling of cavity photons to the electronic states (impurity) noticeably
suppresses the electronic Kondo resonance due to the destruction of many-body
correlations of the Kondo cloud. We observe this transfer of correlations from
the Kondo cloud to the cavity by computing the entropy and mutual information
of the impurity-cavity subsystems. In the weak lead-coupling limit and at
zero-bias, the model exhibits a ground-state photon accumulation effect
originating entirely from counter-rotating terms in the impurity-cavity
interaction. Interestingly, in the strong lead-coupling limit, this
accumulation is Kondo-enhanced by new transition paths opening when increasing
the hybridization to the leads. This suggests a new mechanism for the
generation of real photons from virtual states. Our findings pave the way for
the simultaneous control of both the Kondo effect and a photon accumulation
effect using the ultrastrong coupling of light and matter.

severity of image perturbation and corruption. Results: The proposed technique
is validated on two medical datasets of breast ultrasound image segmentation
and robotassisted surgical scene segmentation and achieved significantly better
performance in terms of segmentation and robustness. Conclusion: P-CD improves
the performance and obtains better generalization and robustness over the

DevOps is a set of practices intended to reduce the friction between the

framework for self-supervised visual representation learning. The MIM
pretrained models, like most deep neural network methods, are still vulnerable
to adversarial attacks, limiting their practical application, and this issue
has received little research attention. In this paper, we investigate how this
powerful self-supervised learning paradigm can provide adversarial robustness
to downstream classifiers. During the exploration, we find that noisy image
modeling (NIM), a simple variant of MIM that adopts denoising as the pre-text
task, reconstructs noisy images surprisingly well despite severe corruption.
Motivated by this observation, we propose an adversarial defense method by
exploiting the pretrained decoder for denoising, referred to as De^3, through
which NIM is able to enhance adversarial robustness beyond providing pretrained
features. Furthermore, we incorporate a simple modification, sampling the noise
scale hyperparameter from random distributions, and enable the defense to
achieve a better and tunable trade-off between accuracy and robustness.
Experimental results demonstrate that, in terms of adversarial robustness, NIM
is superior compared to MIM thanks to its effective denoising capability.
Moreover, the defense provided by NIM achieves performance on par with
adversarial training while offering the extra tunability advantage. Source code

human pose and shape estimation that leverages the strength of both
optimization- and regression-based methods within an end-to-end framework. IKOL
involves a nonconvex optimization that establishes an implicit mapping from an
image's 3D keypoints and body shapes to the relative body-part rotations. The
3D keypoints and the body shapes are the inputs and the relative body-part
rotations are the solutions. However, this procedure is implicit and hard to
make differentiable. So, to overcome this issue, we designed a Gauss-Newton
differentiation (GN-Diff) procedure to differentiate IKOL. GN-Diff iteratively
linearizes the nonconvex objective function to obtain Gauss-Newton directions
with closed form solutions. Then, an automatic differentiation procedure is
directly applied to generate a Jacobian matrix for end-to-end training.
Notably, the GN-Diff procedure works fast because it does not rely on a
time-consuming implicit differentiation procedure. The twist rotation and shape
parameters are learned from the neural networks and, as a result, IKOL has a
much lower computational overhead than most existing optimization-based
methods. Additionally, compared to existing regression-based methods, IKOL
provides a more accurate mesh-image correspondence. This is because it
iteratively reduces the distance between the keypoints and also enhances the
reliability of the pose structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed framework over a wide range of 3D human pose and
shape estimation methods.

related to the hidden scale invariance. The latter is a new statistical scaling
symmetry unbroken in a rescaled (projected) formulation of equations of motion.
In the present work, we consider a shell model of turbulence and describe how
the hidden symmetry manifests itself through all scales, both in the inertial
interval and in the transition to forcing and dissipation ranges. In the
inertial interval, we derive anomalous scaling laws from the hidden symmetry.
Then, we show how a complicated form of the dissipation range is controlled by
intermittent rescaled Reynolds numbers within a large range of dissipation
scales. This dissipative intermittency can be removed by using a special class
of dissipation models. For such models, the hidden scale invariance is restored
both in the inertial interval and the dissipation range. Overall, the presented
approach deduces the multifractal theory and some of its basic conclusions from
the hidden scaling symmetry of equations of motion.

replicator dynamics and gradient ascent, into multi-memory games. Then, we
prove their dynamics are identical. Furthermore, theoretically and

the potential of moir\'e magnetic heterostructures to generate ordered skyrmion

heterostructures formed by twisting ultrathin CrBr_3 films on top of CrI_3

At large moir\'e periodicity and appropriate substrate thickness, a moir\'e
skyrmion lattice emerges in the interfacial CrBr_3 layer due to the weaker
exchange interactions in CrBr_3 compared to CrI_3. This lattice is then
projected to the remaining layers of the CrBr_3 film via emergent chiral
interlayer fields. By varying the pristine stacking configurations within the
ultrathin CrBr_3 film, we realize layered ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
skyrmion lattices without the need for a permanent magnetic field. Our findings
suggest the possibility of creating colorful skyrmion lattices in moir\'e

adversarial networks (GANs) is that the discriminator is trained to estimate a

despite the fact that many variants of GANs were developed following this

algorithms are inconsistent. In this paper, we leverage Wasserstein gradient
flows which characterize the evolution of particles in the sample space, to
gain theoretical insights and algorithmic inspiration of GANs. We introduce a
unified generative modeling framework - MonoFlow: the particle evolution is
rescaled via a monotonically increasing mapping of the log density ratio. Under
our framework, adversarial training can be viewed as a procedure first
obtaining MonoFlow's vector field via training the discriminator and the
generator learns to draw the particle flow defined by the corresponding vector
field. We also reveal the fundamental difference between variational divergence
minimization and adversarial training. This analysis helps us to identify what
types of generator loss functions can lead to the successful training of GANs

non-saturated loss), as long as they realize MonoFlow. Consistent empirical

show that, when bodies losing mass due to friction are treated, as they should,
as variable mass systems, a relationship analogous to the relativistic mass
formula is recovered. This result suggests that mathematical structures typical
of relativistic physics could have been discovered prior to 1905, without
making any reference to electromagnetism, group theory or the speed of light.
Also this result could point to the existence of a physical theory depending on
two constants, the speed of light (Reye's constant) and a universal frictional
deceleration with respect to an absolute frame. The limit of the theory for
vanishing friction would give Special Relativity, as the absolute frame would
become unobservable, while the limit for the speed of light going to infinity
would lead to Aristotelian mechanics, i.e. a classical mechanics type theory
presenting universal friction. Finally, I present a reference frame
transformation that displays these features and I apply the theory to some open
cosmological problems.

Each level is populated with ontological components or, in other words,
ontologies. Ontologies at the same level can be related to each other, except
at the foundational level, where only ThingFO (Thing Foundational Ontology) is
found. In addition, ontologies' terms and relationships at lower levels can be
semantically enriched by ontologies' terms and relationships from the higher

  Root-Weighted Tree Automata",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tree kernels have been proposed to be used in many areas as the automatic
learning of natural language applications. In this paper, we propose a new
linear time algorithm based on the concept of weighted tree automata for
SubTree kernel computation. First, we introduce a new class of weighted tree
automata, called Root-Weighted Tree Automata, and their associated formal tree
series. Then we define, from this class, the SubTree automata that represent
compact computational models for finite tree languages. This allows us to
design a theoretically guaranteed linear-time algorithm for computing the
SubTree Kernel based on weighted tree automata intersection. The key idea
behind the proposed algorithm is to replace DAG reduction and nodes sorting
steps used in previous approaches by states equivalence classes computation
allowed in the weighted tree automata approach. Our approach has three major
advantages: it is output-sensitive, it is free sensitive from the tree types
(ordered trees versus unordered trees), and it is well adapted to any
incremental tree kernel based learning methods. Finally, we conduct a variety
of comparative experiments on a wide range of synthetic tree languages datasets
adapted for a deep algorithm analysis. The obtained results show that the
proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

interfacial quality between the TI and the FM is of utmost importance in
determining the nature and efficiency of the SOT. To optimize the SOT magnitude
and enable ultra-low-power magnetization switching, an atomically smooth

Phases 3 & 4 involve developing a ViT model for edge computing systems that can

spatial point information and ignore surface geometry, we explore geometry
aware rigid-body dynamics to regulate the particle (point) motion, which
results in more precise and robust registration. Our proposed method consists
of four major modules. First, we leverage the graph signal processing (GSP)
framework to define a new signature, (i.e., point response intensity for each
point), by which we succeed in describing the local surface variation,
resampling keypoints, and distinguishing different particles. Then, to address
the shortcomings of current physics-based approaches that are sensitive to
outliers, we accommodate the defined point response intensity to median
absolute deviation (MAD) in robust statistics and adopt the X84 principle for
adaptive outlier depression, ensuring a robust and stable registration.
Subsequently, we propose a novel geometric invariant under rigid
transformations to incorporate higher-order features of point clouds, which is
further embedded for force modeling to guide the correspondence between
pairwise scans credibly. Finally, we introduce an adaptive simulated annealing
(ASA) method to search for the global optimum and substantially accelerate the
registration process. We perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
proposed method on various datasets captured from range scanners to LiDAR.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms representative

registering large-scale point clouds. Furthermore, it is considerably faster

fragile and inefficient for Multi-Person Head Pose Estimation (MPHPE) since
they rely on the separately trained face detector that cannot generalize well
to full viewpoints, especially for heads with invisible face areas. In this
paper, we focus on the full-range MPHPE problem, and propose a direct
end-to-end simple baseline named DirectMHP. Due to the lack of datasets
applicable to the full-range MPHPE, we firstly construct two benchmarks by
extracting ground-truth labels for head detection and head orientation from
public datasets AGORA and CMU Panoptic. They are rather challenging for having
many truncated, occluded, tiny and unevenly illuminated human heads. Then, we
design a novel end-to-end trainable one-stage network architecture by joint
regressing locations and orientations of multi-head to address the MPHPE
problem. Specifically, we regard pose as an auxiliary attribute of the head,
and append it after the traditional object prediction. Arbitrary pose
representation such as Euler angles is acceptable by this flexible design.
Then, we jointly optimize these two tasks by sharing features and utilizing
appropriate multiple losses. In this way, our method can implicitly benefit
from more surroundings to improve HPE accuracy while maintaining head detection
performance. We present comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art single

(PNe), either directly or indirectly after being enhanced by binary

around pre-PNe have been inferred from polarisation observations of masers.
However, because masers probe very specific regions, it is still unclear if the
maser results are representative of the intrinsic magnetic field in the
circumstellar envelope (CSE). Molecular line polarisation can provide important
information about the magnetic field. A comparison between the field morphology
determined from maser observations and that observed in the more diffuse CO
gas, can reveal if the two tracers probe the same magnetic field. We compare
observations taken with ALMA of molecular line polarisation around the
post-Asymptotic Giant Branch)/pre-PNe star OH~17.7-2.0 with previous
observations of polarisation in the 1612~MHz OH maser region. We detect
CO~$J=2-1$ molecular line polarisation at a level of $\sim4\%$ that displays an
ordered linear polarisation structure. We find that, correcting for Faraday
rotation of the OH~maser linear polarisation vectors, the OH and CO linearly
polarised emission trace the same large scale magnetic field. A structure
function analysis of the CO linear polarisation reveals a plane-of-the-sky
magnetic field strength of $B_\perp\sim1$~mG in the CO region, consistent with
previous OH Zeeman observations. The consistency of the ALMA CO molecular line
polarisation with maser observations indicate that both can be used to
determine the magnetic field in CSEs. The existence of a strong, ordered,

availability of scattering observations at multiple wavelengths and over a

fractal aggregates with a fractal dimension of 1.5 and a characteristic radius
larger than $\sim2~\mu$m. We also determined the radius of the monomer to be
$\sim200$ nm, and monomers much smaller than this size can be ruled out on the
premise that the fractal dimension is less than 2. Furthermore, dust
composition comprising amorphous carbon is found to be favorable to
simultaneously account for the faint scattered light and the flared disk

The LC effect makes the signal statistically non-ergodic along the LoS axis.
The multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) provides an unbiased
alternative to the popular 3D power spectrum as it does not assume statistical
ergodicity along every direction in the signal volume. Unlike the 3D power
spectrum which mixes the cosmic evolution of the 21-cm signal along the LoS $k$
modes, MAPS keeps the evolution information disentangled. Here we first study
the impact of different underlying physical processes during cosmic dawn on the
behaviour of the 21-cm MAPS using simulations of various different scenarios
and models. We also make error predictions in 21-cm MAPS measurements
considering only the system noise and cosmic variance for mock observations of
HERA, NenuFAR and SKA-Low. We find that $100~{\rm h}$ of HERA observations will
be able to measure 21-cm MAPS at $\geq 3\sigma$ for $\ell \lesssim 1000$ with
$0.1\,{\rm MHz}$ channel-width. The better sensitivity of SKA-Low allows
reaching this sensitivity up to $\ell \lesssim 3000$. Note that due to the
difference in the frequency coverage of the various experiements, the CD-EoR
model considered for NenuFAR is different than those used for the HERA and
SKA-Low predictions. Considering NenuFAR with the new model, measurements $\geq
2\sigma$ are possible only for $\ell \lesssim 600$ with $0.2\,{\rm MHz}$

Recently, fragment-based deep generative models have attracted much research

collection of frequent fragments, is usually built upon heuristic rules, which
brings difficulties to capturing common substructures from large amounts of

MiCaM builds a connection-aware generator, which simultaneously picks up motifs

improvements over previous fragment-based baselines. Furthermore, we

$\textit{ionicity}$ on example of the simplest molecules. First, starting from
the exact expression for the two-particle wave function in the case of $H_2$
molecule within the Heitler-London model, we demonstrate an unphysical behavior
of the covalency at large interatomic distance which, within standard
definition, reaches the maximal value in the limit of separated atoms. Second,
we correct this deficiency by introducing the concept of $\textit{atomicity}$,
with the help of which, we define the $\textit{true}$ (intrinsic)
$\textit{covalency}$, as well as retain the precise concept of
$\textit{ionicity}$. We connect the introduced atomicity to the onset of
Mott-Hubbard localization, adopted here from the well established notion in the
condensed matter. The evolution from the molecular to atomic states develops
rapidly with interatomic distance beyond the localization threshold. This brief
overview is intented as pedagogical in nature, nonetheless is analyzed
quantitatively for the case of $H_2$ molecule. At the end, we outline a
similar-type of model for the related case of the hydrogen bond on example of
adenine-tymine pair. Methodologically, the approach is based on combining the
first- (wave mechanics) and second-quantization into a single scheme of formal
description.

control the magnetization in ferromagnetic heterostructures. Lately, an
increasing attention has been devoted to SOTs in heavy metal (HM)/magnetic
insulator (MI) bilayers owing to their tunable magnetic properties and
insulating nature. Quantitative characterization of SOTs in HM/MI
heterostructures are, thus, vital for fundamental understanding of charge-spin
interrelations and designing novel devices. However, the accurate determination
of SOTs in MIs have been limited so far due to small electrical signal outputs
and dominant spurious thermoelectric effects caused by Joule heating. Here, we
report a simple methodology based on harmonic Hall voltage detection and
macrospin simulations to accurately quantify the damping-like and field-like
SOTs, and thermoelectric contributions separately in MI-based systems.
Experiments on the archetypical Bi-doped YIG/Pt heterostructure using the
developed method yield precise values for the field-like and damping-like SOTs,
reaching -0.14 and -0.15 mT per 1.7x$10^{ 11}$ A/$m^2$, respectively. We
further reveal that current-induced Joule heating changes the spin transparency
at the interface, reducing the spin Hall magnetoresistance and damping-like
SOT, simultaneously. These results and the devised method can be beneficial for
fundamental understanding of SOTs in MI-based heterostructures and designing
new devices where accurate knowledge of SOTs is necessary.

with fermions are thought to dominate: one is induced by the spatial gradient
of the axion field and called the axion wind, and the other by the
time-derivative of the axion field, generating axioelectric effects. By
generalizing Schiff theorem, it is demonstrated that this latter operator is
actually strongly screened. For a neutral fermion, it can be entirely rotated
away and is unobservable. For charged fermions, the only effect that can peek
through the screening is an axion-induced electric dipole moment (EDM). These
EDMs are not related to the axion coupling to gluons, represent a prediction of
the Dirac theory analogous to the g = 2 magnetic moments, are not further
screened by the original Schiff theorem, and are ultimately responsible for
inducing the usual axioelectric ionization. The two main phenomenological
consequences are then that first the axion-induced neutron EDM could be several
orders of magnitude larger than expected from the axion gluonic coupling, and
second, that the electron EDM could also become available, and could actually
be highly sensitive to relic axions.

optoelectronic devices with the standard Si technology. The growth mode as well
as the chemical, morphological and structural properties of samples prepared
using different growth temperatures and N precursor fluxes were analyzed by
RHEED, XRD, RBS, NRA, EDX spectroscopy, AFM and TEM. Our results show that, up
to x = 0.04, it is possible to synthesize smooth and chemically homogeneous
GaP1-xNx layers with a high-structural quality in a 2D fashion, namely,
layer-by-layer. For a given N mole fraction, the layer-by-layer growth mode is
favored by lowering the growth temperature while decreasing the N precursor
flux. As the flux of the N precursor is increased at a given temperature to
enhance N incorporation, the quality of the layers degrades upon exceeding a
temperature-dependent threshold; above this threshold, the growing layer
experiences a growth mode transition from 2D to 3D after reaching a critical
thickness of a few nm. Following that transition, the morphology and the
chemical composition become modulated along the [110] direction with a period
of several tens of nm. The surface morphology is then characterized by the
formation of {113}-faceted wires, while the N concentration is enhanced at the
troughs formed in between adjacent (113) and (-1-13) facets. We conclude on the
feasibility of fabricating homogeneous thick GaP1-xNx layers lattice matched to
Si (x = 0.021) or even with N content up to x=0.04. The possibility of
exceeding a N mole fraction of 0.04 without inducing coupled
morphological-compositional modulations has also been demonstrated when the
layer thickness is kept below the critical value for the 2D-3D growth mode
transition.

equations in non-divergence form with highly oscillating periodic diffusion
coefficients and with large drifts, in the so-called ``centered'' setting where
homogenization occurs and the large drifts contribute to the effective
diffusivity. Using the centering condition and the invariant measures
associated to the underlying diffusion process, we transform the equation into
divergence form with modified diffusion coefficients but without drift. The
latter is in the standard setting for which quantitative homogenization results
have been developed systematically. An application of those results then yields
quantitative estimates, such as the convergence rates and uniform Lipschitz
regularity, for equations in non-divergence form with large drifts.

particle (RTP) confined to a finite interval $[0,L]$ with partially absorbing,
sticky boundaries at both ends. We assume that the particle switches between
two constant velocity states $\pm v$ at a rate $\alpha$. Whenever the particle
hits a boundary, it becomes stuck by pushing on the boundary until either a
tumble event reverses the swimming direction or it is permanently absorbed. We
formulate the absorption process by identifying the first passage time (FPT)
for absorption with the event that the time $A(t)$ spent attached to either
wall up to time $t$ (the occupation time) crosses some random threshold
$\hat{A}$. Taking $\Psi({a})\equiv\mathbb{P}[\hat{A}\gt{a}]$ to be an
exponential distribution, $\Psi[{a}]=e^{-\kappa_0a}$, we show that the joint
probability density for particle position $X(t)$ and velocity state
$\sigma(t)=\pm $ satisfies a well-defined boundary value problem (BVP) with
$\kappa_0$ representing a constant absorption rate. The solution of this BVP
determines the so-called occupation time propagator, which is the joint
probability density for the triplet $(X(t),A(t),\sigma(t))$. The propagator is
then used to incorporate more general models of absorption based on
non-exponential (non-Markovian) distributions $\Psi(a)$. We illustrate the
theory by calculating the mean FPT (MFPT) and splitting probabilities for
absorption. We also show how our previous results for partially absorbing,
non-sticky boundaries can be recovered in an appropriate limit. Absorption now
depends on the number of collisions $\ell(t)$ of the RTP with the boundary.
Finally, we extend the theory by taking absorption to depend on the individual
occupation times at the two ends.

Recent advances in differentiable rendering have enabled the training of 3D

the generated 3D humans still has much room to improve in terms of both
fidelity and diversity. In this paper, we present Get3DHuman, a novel 3D human
framework that can significantly boost the realism and diversity of the

key observation is that the 3D generator can profit from human-related priors
learned through 2D human generators and 3D reconstructors. Specifically, we
bridge the latent space of Get3DHuman with that of StyleGAN-Human via a
specially-designed prior network, where the input latent code is mapped to the
shape and texture feature volumes spanned by the pixel-aligned 3D
reconstructor. The outcomes of the prior network are then leveraged as the
supervisory signals for the main generator network. To ensure effective
training, we further propose three tailored losses applied to the generated
feature volumes and the intermediate feature maps. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Get3DHuman greatly outperforms the other state-of-the-art

battery budget limiting their inspection time. The inspection vehicle is
assumed to be an autonomous multi-copter with a wide range of possible flight
speeds influencing battery consumption. The inspection plan is represented by
multiple routes for vehicles providing full coverage over inspection target
power lines. On an inspection vehicle mission interruption, which might happen
at any time during the execution of the inspection plan, the inspection is
re-planned using the remaining vehicles and their remaining battery budgets.
Robustness is introduced by choosing a suitable cost function for the initial

their respective remaining battery budgets. A combinatorial metaheuristic

present the planetary signal detection. The latter utilizes Spitzer photometry
to measure a parallax signal. Combined with finite source effects, they claim
to measure the mass and distance of the system to much greater accuracy,
suggesting that it is composed of an Earth-mass planet orbiting an ultracool

in the disk moving perpendicular to disk rotation. Moreover, parallaxes are
known to be affected by systematic errors in the photometry. Therefore, we
reanalyze the Spitzer photometry for this event and conclude that the parallax
signal is not significantly greater than the instrumental noise, and is likely
affected by systematic errors in the photometric data. The results of this

Prompt-Kernel Matching transfers pseudo masks into prompts and injects the

state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for
non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy
drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first
demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e.
variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that
learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance
estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware
recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable
variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains
fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase).
STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically
sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample
concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP

translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the

for their design, synthesis, and analysis. Particle filters are estimators
constructed by simulating trajectories from a sampling distribution and
averaging them based on their importance weight. For particle filters to be
computationally tractable, it must be feasible to simulate the trajectories by
drawing from the sampling distribution. Simultaneously, these trajectories need
to reflect the reality of the nonlinear dynamical system so that the resulting
estimators are accurate. Thus, the crux of particle filters lies in designing
sampling distributions that are both easy to sample from and lead to accurate
estimators. In this work, we propose to learn the sampling distributions. We
put forward four methods for learning sampling distributions from observed
measurements. Three of the methods are parametric methods in which we learn the
mean and covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian distribution; each
methods exploits a different aspect of the data (generic, time structure, graph
structure). The fourth method is a nonparametric alternative in which we
directly learn a transform of a uniform random variable. All four methods are
trained in an unsupervised manner by maximizing the likelihood that the states
may have produced the observed measurements. Our computational experiments
demonstrate that learned sampling distributions exhibit better performance than
designed, minimum-degeneracy sampling distributions.

  High-Resolution Regional Ocean Model",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The internal-wave (IW) continuum of a regional ocean model is studied in
terms of the vertical spectral kinetic-energy (KE) fluxes and transfers at high
vertical wavenumbers. Previous work has shown that this model permits a partial
representation of the IW cascade. In this work, vertical spectral KE flux is
decomposed into catalyst, source, and destination frequency bands of nonlinear
scattering, a framework that allows for the discernment of different types of
nonlinear interactions involving both waves and eddies. Energy transfer within
the supertidal IW continuum is found to be strongly dependent on horizontal
resolution. Specifically, at a horizontal grid spacing of 1/48-degrees, the
vast majority of KE in the supertidal continuum arrives there from lower
frequency modes through a single nonlinear interaction, while at 1/384-degrees
KE transfers within the supertidal IW continuum are comparable in size to KE
transfer from lower-frequency modes. Additionally, comparisons are made with
existing theoretical and observational work on energy pathways in the IW
continuum. Induced diffusion (ID) is found to be associated with a weak forward
frequency transfer within the supertidal IW continuum. Spectrally local
interactions are found to play an insignificant role within the model
evolution. At the same time, ID-like processes involving high
vertical-wavenumber near-inertial and tidal waves as well as
low-vertical-wavenumber eddy fields are substantial, suggesting that the
processes giving rise to a Garrett-Munk-like spectra in the present numerical
simulation and perhaps the real ocean may be more varied than in idealized or
wave-only frameworks.

FBA, where transactions are arranged into batches and a uniform price double
auction decides execution order. We model three types of players, common
investors, privately informed traders, and arbitrageurs who can provide
liquidity and front-run, along with a decentralized exchange. Assuming that the
exchange is realized over an of-ABC protocol, we find that FBA can achieve
better social welfare compared to CLOB when (1) public information affecting
the fundamental value of an asset is revealed more frequently, or (2) the block
generation interval is sufficiently large, or (3) the priority fees are small

discrete and ensuring order fairness there is non-trivial, allowing even more
room for latency arbitrage rents under CLOB; second, sufficiently large block

reference frame rather than the customary Newtonian rectilinear inertial frame.
Infinitesimal calculus cofounder and continental contemporary of Newton,
Leibniz claimed that the second radial derivative could be found by taking the
difference between an inertial force varying inversely, with the cubed radius
and the gravitational force varying with an inversed squared radius. His radial
method was severely criticised by Newton and supporters, who preferred the
rectilinear inertial frame, also claiming Leibniz failed to satisfy Newton's
third law of gravity. We show that these two approaches are equivalent if the
central body is much larger than that in orbit. Furthermore we justify the
Leibniz least action approach using the semi-latus rectum of the orbit,
characteristic of the eccentricity to calculate the Newtonian centripetal
acceleration opposed by the inertial acceleration, with the net radial
acceleration controlling radius also allowing estimation of angular
displacement and the action for each interval. Numerically, our Leibniz model
can be more accurate since it requires no assumption that linear vectors
adequately simulate a curvilinear trajectory. Our review of the Newton
gravitational equation using centre of mass coordinates concludes that the
third law is satisfied for symmetry if the gravitational and inertial masses
are taken separately as equating force expressions for gravity and radial
inertia, directed to the centre of mass for radial inertia. This symmetry
validates centre of mass radial coordinates for more accurate plotting of
orbits including dual stars, possibly applicable for better understanding of
Einstein relativity. An advantage of radial coordinates is that orbiting
couples can also accept perturbations from other nearby bodies acting
centripetally, but not inertially.

(e.g., the number of vertices and edges) as input, and generates a sequence of
instructions for inference execution. We develop the following compiler
optimizations to reduce inference latency: (1) computation order optimization
that automatically reorders the computation graph to reduce the total
computation complexity, (2) layer fusion that merges adjacent layers to reduce
data communication volume, (3) data partitioning with a partition-centric
execution scheme that partitions the input graph to fit the available on-chip
memory of FPGA, (4) kernel mapping that automatically selects execution mode
for ACK, and performs task scheduling to overlap computation with data
communication and achieves dynamic load balance. We implement GraphAGILE on a
state-of-the-art FPGA platform, Xilinx Alveo U250. GraphAGILE can execute
widely used GNN models, including GCN, GAT, GIN, GraphSAGE, SGC and other GNN
models supported by GraphGym.

  welcome",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The currently used standardisation of type Ia supernovae results in Hubble
residuals whose physical origin is unaccounted for. This poses a limitation to
the accuracy and precision of distances that can be derived from supernova
observations. Here, we present a complete physical interpretation of the Hubble
residuals based on a novel Bayesian hierarchical model of type Ia supernovae in
which latent variables describing intrinsic and extrinsic (dust related)
supernova properties originate from two populations. Fitting the model to SALT2
light curve parameters of supernovae in the Hubble flow we find strong
(4\sigma) evidence for the presence of two overlapping, but distinct,
populations differentiated primarily by their mean SALT2 shape parameter
(stretch) x_1. Supernovae from the population with predominantly slow decliners
(higher average x_1) are found to be intrinsically bluer (mean SALT2 colour
c=-0.11) and twice as reddened by dust (mean reddening E(B-V)=0.10) than those
from the opposite population dominated by fast decliners (lower average x_1)
with c=-0.04$ and E(B-V)=0.05. The inferred extinction coefficient R_B in both
supernova populations follows a broad (scatter 0.9) distribution with a mean of
4.1 which coincides closely with the mean extinction law measured in the Milky
Way. We also find that the supernova data favour a peaked (two-tailed)
distribution of selective extinction E(B-V) over the commonly adopted
exponential model (one-tailed with maximum fixed at 0). Our model provides a
complete explanation of the distribution of supernova light curve parameters in
terms of extinction properties and the above-mentioned differences between the
two populations, without the need for introducing any intrinsic scatter.

the listener position, our learning-based binaural sound propagation approach
can generate an acoustic effect in 0.1 milliseconds on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX

the Laptev Sea, where there are historically no wave observations available. An
experimental wave buoy was deployed alongside a commercial buoy. The inter-buoy
comparison showed that the experimental buoy measured wave heights and periods
accurately; so the buoy data were used to study the predictability of a
wave-ice model in this region. The first event we focused was when both buoys
observed a sudden decrease in significant wave heights $H_{m0}$. The sudden
decrease was caused by the change of wind directions from along the ice edge to
off-ice wind. This event was compared with the ARC MFC wave-ice model product,
which underestimated the $H_{m0}$. The inaccurate model representation of an
ice tongue located upwind of the buoys was found to constrain the available
fetch for wave growth. The second case was when the buoys entered ice cover as
new ice formed; an on-ice wave event was observed and the buoy downwind
measured 1.25 m $H_{m0}$. In this instance, the ARC MFC wave-ice model product
largely underestimated the downwind buoy $H_{m0}$. To investigate this event,
model sea ice conditions were examined by comparing the ARC MFC sea ice forcing
with the neXtSIM sea ice model product. Our analysis revealed that the thin ice
thickness distribution for ice types like young and grey ice, typically less
than 30 cm, were not resolved. The ARC MFC model's wave dissipation rate has a
sea ice thickness dependence, and therefore, it overestimates wave dissipation
in thin ice cover; sea ice forcing that can resolve the thin thickness
distribution is needed to improve the predictability. This study provides an
observational insight into better predictions of waves in marginal ice zones
when new ice forms.

description of the double-layer capacitance, on the one hand, and the
pseudocapacitive contribution due to adsorption or intercalation of reactive
species, on the other. In the present work, a new approach to describe
electrochemical capacitance from first principles is developed. The treatment
of a general electrochemical system at the level of multicomponent
density-functional theory (MCDFT) yields an exact analytical expression for the
total capacitance of the system, which corresponds to a formal series-circuit
partitioning into ""quantum"" capacitance contributions of the density of states
of electrons and ions, the (mean-field) electrostatic capacitance, as well as
capacitance contributions of exchange and correlation among all active species.
It is shown that the classical expression of the double-layer capacitance
involving the interfacial Galvani potential is obtained in the limit of
extended electrode and electrolyte regions. Importantly, the present formalism
also describes systems with confined electrode and electrolyte phases, where
the definition of the (classical) inner potentials of the electrode and
electrolyte domains becomes problematic. Moreover, the new approach unifies the
treatment of double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance resulting from
reactive processes.

dielectric Huygens' metasurface that performs anomalous refraction, offering a
low-loss platform for wave manipulation at high frequencies as compared to
their lossy metallic analogue. The coarse discretization dramatically
simplifies the design, resulting in a metasurface that is highly efficient,
cost-effective, and robust. In this paper, the proposed metasurface comprises
two meta-atoms per period and is hence named the bipartite dielectric Huygens'
metasurface. Through full-wave simulations at 28 GHz, we show that the proposed
metasurface can reroute an incident EM wave from $\theta_i=15^{\circ}$ to
$\theta_t=-44.5^{\circ}$ with very high efficiency: 87% of the scattered power
is anomalously transmitted to $\theta_t$. Based on our observations, a coarsely

design meta-devices with multifaceted functionalities in different frequency

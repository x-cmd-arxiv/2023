1950, who asked whether the minimum modulus of a covering system with distinct
moduli is bounded. In 2007, Filaseta, Ford, Konyagin, Pomerance and Yu affirmed
it if the reciprocal sum of the moduli of a covering system is bounded. Later
in 2015, Hough resolved this problem by showing that the minimum modulus is at
most $10^{16}$. In 2022, Balister, Bollob\'as, Morris, Sahasrabudhe and Tiba
reduced this bound to $616,000$ by developing a versatile method called the
distortion method. Recently, Klein, Koukoulopoulos and Lemieux generalized
Hough's result by using this method. In this paper, we develop the distortion
method by introducing the theory of probability measures associated to an
inverse system. Following Klein et al.'s work, we derive an analogue of their
theorem in the setting of number fields, which provides a solution to
Erd\H{o}s' minimum modulus problem in number fields.

sort logic is the strongest logic. In fact, every model class definable in set

intelligent supervision such as fog node deployments, which is an essential
task to assess network operability. To ensure network operability, the
deployment process must be carried out effectively in terms of two main
factors: connectivity and coverage. The network connectivity is based on fog
node deployment which determines the physical topology of the network while the
coverage determines the network accessibility. Both have a significant impact
on network performance and guarantee the network QoS. Determining an optimum
fog node deployment method that minimizes cost, reduces computation and
communication overhead, and provides a high degree of network connection
coverage is extremely hard. Therefore, maximizing coverage as well as
preserving network connectivity is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we
proposed a fog deployment algorithm that can effectively connect the fog nodes
and cover all edge devices. Firstly, we formulate fog deployment as an instance
of multi-objective optimization problems with a large search space. Then, we
leverage Marine Predator Algorithm (MPA) to tackle the deployment problem and
prove that MPA is well-suited for fog node deployment due to its rapid
convergence and low computational complexity compared to other population-based
algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a different
benchmark of generated instances with various fog scenario configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is capable of
providing very promising results when compared to state-of-the-art methods for
determining an optimal deployment of fog nodes.

this work, we design and implement a bad data detection solution for electrical

high-throughput substation communication scenarios, while still maintaining
high detection accuracy and confidence. While many existing physics-based
schemes are designed for deployment in control centers (due to their high
computational requirement), ResiGate is designed as a security appliance that
can be deployed on low-cost industrial computers at the edge of the smart grid
so that it can detect local substation-level attacks in a timely manner. A key
challenge for this is to continuously run the computationally demanding
physics-based analysis to monitor the measurement data frequently transmitted
in a typical substation. To provide high throughput without sacrificing
accuracy, ResiGate uses machine learning to effectively filter out most of the
non-suspicious (normal) data and thereby reducing the overall computational
load, allowing efficient performance even with a high volume of network
traffic. We implement ResiGate on a low-cost industrial computer and our

anisotropic transformation strain tensor $\varepsilon_{t}=\{0.1753;0.1753;

stress-controlled loadings under periodic boundary conditions and zero averaged
lateral strains. Coupled evolution of discrete martensitic microstructure,
volume fractions of martensitic variants and Si II, stress and transformation
strain tensors, and texture are presented and analyzed. Macroscopic variables
effectively representing multivariant transformational behavior are introduced.
Macroscopic stress-strain and transformational behavior for 55 and 910 grains
are close (less than 10% difference). This allows the determination of
macroscopic constitutive equations by treating aggregate with a small number of
grains. Large transformation strains and grain boundaries lead to huge internal
stresses of tens GPa, which affect microstructure evolution and macroscopic
behavior. In contrast to a single crystal, the local mechanical instabilities
due to PT and negative local tangent modulus are stabilized at the macroscale
by arresting/slowing the growth of Si II regions by the grain boundaries and
generating the internal back stresses. This leads to increasing stress during
PT. The developed methodology can be used for studying similar PTs with large
transformation strains and for further development by including plastic strain
and strain-induced PTs.

opens novel avenues of fabricating low-dimensional nanomaterials, which renders
the development of new device architectures and their applications in advanced
electronics, optoelectronics and photonics, etc. Since the last twenty years,
nanomaterials with various geometries (i.e. dots, wires, trees, tubes, flakes,

vapor-liquid-solid, vapor-solid-solid, in plane solid-liquid-solid, etc.) by
different deposition techniques (CVD, PECVD, MOCVD, MBE, etc.). In contrast
with liquid phase epitaxy where metal liquid severs as stationary reservoir
that accommodates gaseous precursors, metal droplets have to be kicked off
in-plane on/out-of-plane from the substrates so as to steer the growth of
low-dimensional nanomaterials. In this review, we shall regard the growth

spreading behaviors and their consequent nanofluidic transport, which involves
deposition parameters, solid-liquid interfaces, crystal phases, substrate
nanofacets and so on, which deterministically results in various morphologies

probability distributions to elements of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space

encoded with an RKHS valued function, the conditional kernel mean map. In this
paper we present a new recursive algorithm to estimate the conditional kernel
mean map in a Hilbert space valued $L_2$ space, that is in a Bochner space. We
prove the weak and strong $L_2$ consistency of our recursive estimator under
mild conditions. The idea is to generalize Stone's theorem for Hilbert space
valued regression in a locally compact Polish space. We present new insights
about conditional kernel mean embeddings and give strong asymptotic bounds
regarding the convergence of the proposed recursive method. Finally, the
results are demonstrated on three application domains: for inputs coming from
Euclidean spaces, Riemannian manifolds and locally compact subsets of function
spaces.

by analyzing the effectiveness of UR tasks (including both sentence-level and
entity-level tasks) in three aspects: (1) QA performance, (2) reasoning
shortcuts, and (3) robustness. While the previous models have not been
explicitly trained on an entity-level reasoning prediction task, we build a

facts prediction, entity-level reasoning prediction, and answer prediction.
Experimental results on 2WikiMultiHopQA and HotpotQA-small datasets reveal that
(1) UR tasks can improve QA performance. Using four debiased datasets that are

reasoning shortcuts in the multi-hop QA task. However, we find that (3) UR
tasks do not contribute to improving the robustness of the model on adversarial

effective-resistances ($\ell_2$-congestion) on trees, which is of independent
interest in electrical network analysis. For general graphs, we prove an upper
bound $\alpha(G)$ on the approximation ratio obtained by Lewis weights, which
is always $\leq \min\{ \text{diam}(G), \kappa(L_{w_\infty})\}$, where $\kappa$
is the condition number of the weighted Laplacian. All our approximation
algorithms run in \emph{input-sparsity} time $\tilde{O}(m)$, a major
improvement over Saberi et al.'s $O(m^{3.5})$ SDP for exact ER-minimization.
  Finally, we demonstrate the favorable effects of $\ell_\infty$-LW reweighting
on the \emph{spectral-gap} of graphs and on their \emph{spectral-thinness}
(Anari and Gharan, 2015). En-route to our results, we prove a weighted analogue
of Mohar's classical bound on $\lambda_2(G)$, and provide a new
characterization of leverage-scores of a matrix, as the gradient (w.r.t
weights) of the volume of the enclosing ellipsoid.

twists of the electromagnetic field, commonly formed by the interaction of
light and matter. Formation of vortices by effective interaction of light with
itself requires strong optical nonlinearity and has therefore been confined,
until now, to the classical regime. Here we report on the realization of
quantum vortices resulting from a strong photon-photon interaction in a quantum
nonlinear optical medium. The interaction causes faster phase accumulation for
co-propagating photons. Similarly to a plate pushing water, the local phase
accumulation produces a quantum vortex-antivortex pair within the two-photon
wavefunction. For three photons, the formation of vortex lines and a central
vortex ring attests to a genuine three-photon interaction. The wavefunction
topology, governed by two- and three-photon bound states, imposes a conditional
phase shift of $\pi$-per-photon, a potential resource for deterministic quantum
logic operations.

modeled by variable coefficients of wave equations, using sources that emit
probing signals and receivers that record the generated waves. It is an old and
intensively studied inverse problem with a wide range of applications, but the
existing inversion methodologies are still far from satisfactory. The typical
mathematical formulation is a nonlinear least squares data fit optimization and
the difficulty stems from the non-convexity of the objective function that
displays numerous local minima at which local optimization approaches stagnate.
This pathological behavior has at least three unavoidable causes: (1) The
mapping from the unknown coefficients to the wave field is nonlinear and
complicated. (2) The sources and receivers typically lie on a single side of
the medium, so only backscattered waves are measured. (3) The probing signals
are band limited and with high frequency content. There is a lot of activity in
the computational science and engineering communities that seeks to mitigate
the difficulty of estimating the medium by data fitting. In this paper we
present a different point of view, based on reduced order models (ROMs) of two
operators that control the wave propagation. The ROMs are called data driven
because they are computed directly from the measurements, without any knowledge
of the wave field inside the inaccessible medium. This computation is
non-iterative and uses standard numerical linear algebra methods. The resulting
ROMs capture features of the physics of wave propagation in a complementary way
and have surprisingly good approximation properties that facilitate waveform
inversion.

  forces via adhesive matrix transfer",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pristine van der Waals (vdW) interfaces between two-dimensional (2D) and
other materials are core to emerging optical and electronic devices. Their
direct fabrication is, however, challenged as the vdW forces are weak and
cannot be tuned to accommodate integration of arbitrary layers without
solvents, sacrificial-layers or high-temperatures, steps that can introduce
damage. To address these limitations, we introduce a single-step 2D
material-to-device integration approach in which forces promoting transfer are
decoupled from the vdW forces at the interface of interest. We use this
adhesive matrix transfer to demonstrate conventionally-forbidden direct
integration of diverse 2D materials (MoS2, WSe2, PtS2, GaS) with dielectrics
(SiO2, Al2O3), and scalable, aligned heterostructure formation, both
foundational to device development. We then demonstrate a single-step
integration of monolayer-MoS2 into arrays of transistors. With no exposure to
polymers or solvents, clean interfaces and pristine surfaces are preserved,
which can be further engineered to demonstrate both n- and p-type behavior.
Beyond serving as a platform to probe the intrinsic properties of sensitive
nanomaterials without the influence of processing steps, our technique allows
efficient formation of unconventional device form-factors, with an example of
flexible transistors demonstrated.

becomes a limitation as it does not capture the interplay that naturally exists
between domains. In this work, we efficiently learn multi-domain representation
of sequential users' interactions using graph neural networks. We use temporal
intra- and inter-domain interactions as contextual information for our method
called MAGRec (short for Multi-domAin Graph-based Recommender). To better
capture all relations in a multi-domain setting, we learn two graph-based
sequential representations simultaneously: domain-guided for recent user
interest, and general for long-term interest. This approach helps to mitigate
the negative knowledge transfer problem from multiple domains and improve
overall representation. We perform experiments on publicly available datasets
in different scenarios where MAGRec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art

transition between two liquids (LLPT) in the supercooled regime connected to
the glassy first order phase transition at lower temperatures. Two length
scales potentials are an effective approach that have long being employed to
understand the properties of fluids with waterlike anomalies and, more
recently, the behavior of colloids and nanoparticles. These potentials can be
parameterized to have distinct shapes, as a pure repulsive ramp, such as the
model proposed by de Oliveira et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 124, 64901 (2006)]. This
model has waterlike anomalies despite the absence of LLPT. To unravel how the
waterlike anomalies are connected to the solid phases we employ Molecular
Dynamics simulations. We have analyzed the fluid-solid transition under
cooling, with two solid crystalline phases, BCC and HCP, and two amorphous
regions being observed. We show how the competition between the scales creates
an amorphous cluster in the BCC crystal that leads to the amorphization at low
temperatures. A similar mechanism is found in the fluid phase, with the system
changing from a BCC-like to an amorphous-like structure in the point where a
maxima in $k_T$ is observed. With this, we can relate the competition between
two fluid structures with the amorphous clusterization in the BCC phase.Those
findings help to understand the origins of waterlike behavior in systems

EnDASH-5G -- a wrapper over the popular DASH-based ABR streaming algorithm,

regression settings, proving upper and lower risk bounds in terms of the
average H\""older smoothness; these rates improve upon both previously known
rates even in the special case of average Lipschitz smoothness. Moreover, our
lower bound is tight in the realizable setting up to log factors, thus we
establish the minimax rate. From an algorithmic perspective, since our notion
of average smoothness is defined with respect to the unknown underlying
distribution, the learner does not have an explicit representation of the
function class, hence is unable to execute ERM. Nevertheless, we provide
distinct learning algorithms that achieve both (nearly) optimal learning rates.
Our results hold in any totally bounded metric space, and are stated in terms

tasks in visual percept based RL. We analyze two popular approaches: freezing
or finetuning the pretrained representations. Empirical studies on a set of
popular tasks reveal several properties of pretrained representations. First,
finetuning is required even when pretrained representations perfectly capture
the information required to solve the target task. Second, finetuned
representations improve learnability and are more robust to noise. Third,
pretrained bottom layers are task-agnostic and readily transferable to new
tasks, while top layers encode task-specific information and require
adaptation. Building on these insights, we propose a self-supervised objective
that clusters representations according to the policy they induce, as opposed
to traditional representation similarity measures which are policy-agnostic
(e.g. Euclidean norm, cosine similarity). Together with freezing the bottom
layers, this objective results in significantly better representation than
frozen, finetuned, and self-supervised alternatives on a wide range of
benchmarks.

fluid climbs a thin rotating rod is a popular and convincing experiment
demonstrating the existence of elasticity in polymeric fluids. The interface
shape depends on the rotation rate, fluid elasticity, surface tension, and
inertia. By solving the equations of motion in the low rotation rate limit for
a second-order fluid, a mathematical relationship between the interface
deflection and the fluid material functions, specifically the first and second
normal stress differences, emerges. This relationship has been used in the past
to measure the climbing constant, a combination of the first ($\Psi_{1,0}$) and
second ($\Psi_{2,0}$) normal stress difference coefficients from experimental
observations of rod-climbing in the low inertia limit. However, a quantitative
reconciliation of such observations with the capabilities of modern-day
torsional rheometers is lacking. To this end, we combine rod-climbing
experiments with both small amplitude oscillatory shear flow measurements and
steady shear measurements of the first normal stress difference from commercial
rheometers to quantify the values of both normal stress differences for a
series of polymer solutions. Furthermore, by retaining the oft-neglected
inertial terms, we show that the climbing constant
$\hat{\beta}=0.5\Psi_{1,0}+2\Psi_{2,0}$ can be measured even when the fluids,
in fact, experience rod descending. A climbing condition derived by considering
the competition between elasticity and inertial effects accurately predicts
whether a fluid will undergo rod-climbing or rod-descending. The analysis and
observations presented in this study establish rotating rod rheometry as a
prime candidate for measuring normal stress differences in polymeric fluids at
low shear rates that are often below commercial rheometers' sensitivity limits.

this regard, a group IV germanium-tin (GeSn) material epitaxially grown on
silicon (Si) emerges as a promising platform to implement tunable infrared
light emitters. Indeed, upon increasing the Sn content, the bandgap of GeSn
narrows and becomes direct, making this material system suitable for developing
an efficient silicon-compatible emitter. With this perspective, microbridge PIN
GeSn LEDs with a small footprint of $1,520$ $\mu$m$^2$ are demonstrated and
their operation performance is investigated. The spectral analysis of the
electroluminescence emission exhibits a peak at $2.31$ $\mu$m and it red-shifts
slightly as the driving current increases. It is found that the microbridge LED
operates at a dissipated power as low as $10.8$ W at room temperature and just
$3$ W at $80$ K. This demonstrated low operation power is comparable to that
reported for LEDs having a significantly larger footprint reaching $10^6$
$\mu$m$^2$. The efficient thermal dissipation of the current design helped to
reduce the heat-induced optical losses, thus enhancing light emission. Further
performance improvements are envisioned through thermal and optical simulations
of the microbridge design. The use of GeSnOI substrate for developing a similar
device is expected to improve optical confinement for the realization of
electrically driven GeSn lasers.

agent preferences may evolve over time as a function of prior recommendations,
and algorithms must take this into account for long-run optimization. Recently,
Agarwal and Brown (2022) introduced a model for studying recommendations when
agents' preferences are adaptive, and gave a series of results for the case
when agent preferences depend {\it uniformly} on their history of past
selections. Here, the recommender shows a $k$-item menu (out of $n$) to the
agent at each round, who selects one of the $k$ items via their
history-dependent {\it preference model}, yielding a per-item adversarial
reward for the recommender.
  We expand this setting to {\it non-uniform} preferences, and give a series of
results for {\it $\gamma$-discounted} histories. For this problem, the feasible
regret benchmarks can depend drastically on varying conditions. In the ``large
$\gamma$'' regime, we show that the previously considered benchmark, the ``EIRD
set'', is attainable for any {\it smooth} model, relaxing the ``local
learnability'' requirement from the uniform memory case. We introduce
``pseudo-increasing'' preference models, for which we give an algorithm which
can compete against any item distribution with small uniform noise (the
``smoothed simplex''). We show NP-hardness results for larger regret benchmarks
in each case. We give another algorithm for pseudo-increasing models (under a
restriction on the adversarial nature of the reward functions), which works for
any $\gamma$ and is faster when $\gamma$ is sufficiently small, and we show a
super-polynomial regret lower bound with respect to EIRD for general models in
the ``small $\gamma$'' regime. We conclude with a pair of algorithms for the
memoryless case.

carbonization (HTC) of the pharmaceuticals was carried out at temperatures of
180, 230 and 275 0C in closed reactors for 6, 12 and 24 hours, respectively.
The main products from the carbonization process were in the solids, liquids
and gas phases. The resulting hydrochars were shown to be very functionalized
with a high degree of aromaticity and high carbon content (between 55% to 65%).
The adsorptive capacity of the hydrochars to remove Pb2+ ions from an aqueous
system was evaluated and compared to that of analytical reagent activated
carbon (AR-AC) through batch adsorptive tests. The effect of contact time on
batch adsorption experiments with an initial Pb2+ concentration of 50 mg/L was
also evaluated. The results indicated that PH24_230 has a better adsorption
capacity when compared to AR-AC; achieving over 97% removal of Pb2+ after 60
minutes. The batch adsorption studies were best described by the pseudo-second
order kinetic model with coefficient of regression (R2) values above 0.99.
Also, slow pyrolysis experiments were carried out to evaluate the difference in
solid yields, char heating value and surface area. Pyrochar yields were
slightly higher, while heating values were one order of magnitude lower when
compared to hydrochars. The pyrolysis conducted at 700{\deg}C led to the
pyrochar with the highest value of the surface area (63.15 m2/g). The study
shows that valuable products can be generated successfully from the
hydrothermal carbonization of waste pharmaceuticals.

been limited research on the temporal dynamics of users and suicide ideation.
In this work, we use time-to-event modeling to identify which subreddits have a
higher association with users transitioning to posting on r/suicidewatch. For
this purpose we use a Cox proportional hazards model that takes as input text
and subreddit network features and outputs a probability distribution for the
time until a Reddit user posts on r/suicidewatch. In our analysis we find a
number of statistically significant features that predict earlier transitions
to r/suicidewatch. While some patterns match existing intuition, for example
r/depression is positively associated with posting sooner on r/suicidewatch,
others were more surprising (for example, the average time between a high risk
post on r/Wishlist and a post on r/suicidewatch is 10.2 days). We then discuss
these results as well as directions for future research.

intuitive approximate posterior. Critically, our solution is applicable to
likelihood-based, and generalized, posteriors as well as cases where the

characterize convergence bounds in expectation, which is inadequate as it does
not supply a useful performance guarantee on a single run. Motivated by its
importance, an emerging line of literature has recently studied the
high-probability convergence behavior of several algorithms, including the
classic stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, no high-probability results
are established for optimization algorithms with variance reduction, which is
known to accelerate the convergence process and has been the de facto
algorithmic technique for stochastic optimization at large. To close this
important gap, we introduce a new variance-reduced algorithm for non-convex
stochastic optimization, which we call Generalized SignSTORM. We show that with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our algorithm converges at the rate of
$O(\log(dT/\delta)/T^{1/3})$ after $T$ iterations where $d$ is the problem
dimension. This convergence guarantee matches the existing lower bound up to a
log factor, and to our best knowledge, is the first high-probability minimax
(near-)optimal result. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
algorithm through numerical experiments.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.GT cs.MA econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In domains where agents interact strategically, game theory is applied widely
to predict how agents would behave. However, game-theoretic predictions are
based on the assumption that agents are fully rational and believe in
equilibrium plays, which unfortunately are mostly not true when human decision
makers are involved. To address this limitation, a number of behavioral
game-theoretic models are defined to account for the limited rationality of
human decision makers. The ""quantal cognitive hierarchy"" (QCH) model, which is
one of the more recent models, is demonstrated to be the state-of-art model for
predicting human behaviors in normal-form games. The QCH model assumes that
agents in games can be both non-strategic (level-0) and strategic (level-$k$).
For level-0 agents, they choose their strategies irrespective of other agents.
For level-$k$ agents, they assume that other agents would be behaving at levels
less than $k$ and best respond against them. However, an important assumption
of the QCH model is that the distribution of agents' levels follows a Poisson
distribution. In this paper, we relax this assumption and design a
learning-based method at the population level to iteratively estimate the
empirical distribution of agents' reasoning levels. By using a real-world
dataset from the Swedish lowest unique positive integer game, we demonstrate
how our refined QCH model and the iterative solution-seeking process can be
used in providing a more accurate behavioral model for agents. This leads to
better performance in fitting the real data and allows us to track an agent's
progress in learning to play strategically over multiple rounds.

Objective: We aim to provide a step towards understanding provenance needs of
the software industry to support trustworthy software. Provenance is
information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing data,
software, or output of software, and used to assess software quality,
reliability and trustworthiness of digital products and services. Method: Based
on data from in-person and questionnaire-based interviews with professionals in
leadership roles we develop an ``influence map'' to analyze who drives
provenance, when provenance is relevant, what is impacted by provenance and how
provenance can be managed. Results: The influence map helps decision makers
navigate concerns related to provenance. It can also act as a checklist for
initial provenance analyses of systems. It is empirically-grounded and designed
bottom-up (based on perceptions of practitioners) rather than top-down (from

proteins is mass spectrometry, which allows for obtaining information about the
structure of proteins. Removing isotope peaks from the mass spectrum is vital
and it is done in a process called deisotoping. There are different algorithms
for deisotoping, but they have their limitations, they are dedicated to
different methods of mass spectrometry. Data from experiments performed with
the MALDI-ToF technique are characterized by high dimensionality. This paper
presents a method for identifying isotope envelopes in MALDI-ToF molecular
imaging data based on the Mamdani-Assilan fuzzy system and spatial maps of the
molecular distribution of peaks included in the isotopic envelope. Several
image texture measures were used to evaluate spatial molecular distribution
maps. The algorithm was tested on eight datasets obtained from the MALDI-ToF
experiment on samples from the National Institute of Oncology in Gliwice from
patients with cancer of the head and neck region. The data were subjected to
pre-processing and feature extraction. The results were collected and compared
with three existing deisotoping algorithms. The analysis of the obtained
results showed that the method for identifying isotopic envelopes proposed in
this paper enables the detection of overlapping envelopes by using the approach
oriented to study peak pairs. Moreover, the proposed algorithm enables the
analysis of large data sets.

object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Existing
state-of-the-art methods usually first extract multi-scale features by a

sufficient to fuse the multi-scale features through such a paradigm, because
the parameters allocated for feature fusion are limited compared with the heavy

architecture named Cascade Fusion Network (CFNet) for dense prediction. Besides
the stem and several blocks used to extract initial high-resolution features,
we introduce several cascaded stages to generate multi-scale features in CFNet.
Each stage includes a sub-backbone for feature extraction and an extremely
lightweight transition block for feature integration. This design makes it
possible to fuse features more deeply and effectively with a large proportion
of parameters of the whole backbone. Extensive experiments on object detection,
instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation validated the effectiveness of
the proposed CFNet. Codes will be available at

detect the presence of confounding by hidden factors. A negative control
outcome (NCO) is an outcome that is influenced by unobserved confounders of the
exposure effects on the outcome in view, but is not causally impacted by the
exposure. Tchetgen Tchetgen (2013) introduced the Control Outcome Calibration
Approach (COCA) as a formal NCO counterfactual method to detect and correct for
residual confounding bias. For identification, COCA treats the NCO as an
error-prone proxy of the treatment-free counterfactual outcome of interest, and
involves regressing the NCO on the treatment-free counterfactual, together with
a rank-preserving structural model which assumes a constant individual-level
causal effect. In this work, we establish nonparametric COCA identification for
the average causal effect for the treated, without requiring rank-preservation,
therefore accommodating unrestricted effect heterogeneity across units. This
nonparametric identification result has important practical implications, as it
provides single proxy confounding control, in contrast to recently proposed
proximal causal inference, which relies for identification on a pair of
confounding proxies. For COCA estimation we propose three separate strategies:
(i) an extended propensity score approach, (ii) an outcome bridge function
approach, and (iii) a doubly-robust approach. Finally, we illustrate the
proposed methods in an application evaluating the causal impact of a Zika virus

Then, we leverage Lyapunov optimization to convert the long-term constraints of
the total execution time and energy cost into their short-term constraints,
further yielding a set of per-time-slot optimization problems. Furthermore, we

Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach and a lag-one dynamic
auto-regressive component. The similar and different effects of interrelated

PAs on object detection in O-RSIs, and propose a more Threatening PA without

applying existing coordinate-based loss to PAs directly, we design an IoU-based
objective function specific for PAs, dubbed Bounding box Drifting Loss (BDL),
which pushes the detected bounding boxes far from the initial ones until there
are no intersections between them. Finally, on two widely used benchmarks,

reward mechanism determines the reward for each agent and motivates all agents

cannot exceed the budget set by the task owner. However, our impossibility
results demonstrate that a reward mechanism cannot simultaneously achieve
Sybil-proof (agents benefit from manipulating multiple fake identities),
collusion-proof (multiple agents pretend as a single agent to improve the

From the identification of this spin state ratio, we infer that the dark strips

become one of the main solutions to tackle many software engineering (SE)
tasks, in research studies (ML4SE). This has been achieved by utilizing
state-of-the-art models that tend to be more complex and black-box, which is
led to less explainable solutions that reduce trust and uptake of ML4SE
solutions by professionals in the industry.
  Objective: One potential remedy is to offer explainable AI (XAI) methods to
provide the missing explainability. In this paper, we aim to explore to what
extent XAI has been studied in the SE community (XAI4SE) and provide a
comprehensive view of the current state-of-the-art as well as challenge and
roadmap for future work.
  Method: We conduct a systematic literature review on 24 (out of 869 primary
studies that were selected by keyword search) most relevant published studies
in XAI4SE. We have three research questions that were answered by meta-analysis
of the collected data per paper.
  Results: Our study reveals that among the identified studies, software
maintenance (\%68) and particularly defect prediction has the highest share on
the SE stages and tasks being studied. Additionally, we found that XAI methods
were mainly applied to classic ML models rather than more complex models. We
also noticed a clear lack of standard evaluation metrics for XAI methods in the
literature which has caused confusion among researchers and a lack of
benchmarks for comparisons.
  Conclusions: XAI has been identified as a helpful tool by most studies, which
we cover in the systematic review. However, XAI4SE is a relatively new domain
with a lot of untouched potentials, including the SE tasks to help with, the
ML4SE methods to explain, and the types of explanations to offer. This study
encourages the researchers to work on the identified challenges and roadmap
reported in the paper.

time decay strategy is designed to avoid trapping into local optima. The
experimental results show that the tracking error is significantly small, and
the operation time is one-tenth of that of a traditional algorithm. The OpenAI

and systemic proper motion of the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy at the
heliocentric distance of 86 kpc, which is one of the most important targets for
studies of dark matter nature and galaxy formation physics. Thanks to the
superb image quality and wide area coverage of the Sextans field, the HSC data
enables a secure selection of member star candidates based on the
colour-magnitude cut, yielding about 10,000 member candidates at magnitudes
down to $i\sim 24$. We use a likelihood analysis of the two-dimensional
distribution of stars to estimate the structural parameters of Sextans taking
into account the contamination of foreground halo stars in the Milky Way, and
find that the member star distribution is well-fitted by an elliptical King
profile with ellipticity $\epsilon \simeq 0.25$ and the core and tidal radii of
$R_c=(368.2\pm 8.7)$ pc and $R_t=(2.54\pm 0.045)$ kpc, respectively. Then using
the two HSC datasets of 2.66 years time baseline on average, we find the
systemic proper motions of Sextans to be $(\mu_\alpha,
\mu_\delta)=(-0.508^{+0.071}_{-0.071},0.083^{+0.071}_{-0.072})$ $\mathrm{mas}\

the $Gaia$ data of relatively bright member stars in Sextans. Thus, our results
give a demonstration that a ground-based, large-aperture telescope data which
covers a wide solid angle of the sky and has a long time baseline, such as the
upcoming LSST data, can be used to study systemic proper motions of dwarf

  Navigation","Accepted by AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task which requires an
agent to align complex visual observations to language instructions to reach
the goal position. Most existing VLN agents directly learn to align the raw
directional features and visual features trained using one-hot labels to
linguistic instruction features. However, the big semantic gap among these
multi-modal inputs makes the alignment difficult and therefore limits the
navigation performance. In this paper, we propose Actional Atomic-Concept
Learning (AACL), which maps visual observations to actional atomic concepts for
facilitating the alignment. Specifically, an actional atomic concept is a
natural language phrase containing an atomic action and an object, e.g., ``go
up stairs''. These actional atomic concepts, which serve as the bridge between
observations and instructions, can effectively mitigate the semantic gap and
simplify the alignment. AACL contains three core components: 1) a concept
mapping module to map the observations to the actional atomic concept
representations through the VLN environment and the recently proposed
Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model, 2) a concept refining
adapter to encourage more instruction-oriented object concept extraction by
re-ranking the predicted object concepts by CLIP, and 3) an observation
co-embedding module which utilizes concept representations to regularize the
observation representations. Our AACL establishes new state-of-the-art results
on both fine-grained (R2R) and high-level (REVERIE and R2R-Last) VLN
benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization shows that AACL significantly improves
the interpretability in action decision.

the same training time and boosted the reconstruction performance regardless of

displays of mobile end devices and upsampled to its original resolution when
exhibited on very high-resolution displays. This observation motivates us on
jointly optimizing operation pairs of downsampling and upsampling that are
spatially adaptive to image contents for maximal rate-distortion performance.
In this paper, we propose an adaptive downsampled dual-layer (ADDL) image
compression system. In the ADDL compression system, an image is reduced in
resolution by learned content-adaptive downsampling kernels and compressed to
form a coded base layer. For decompression the base layer is decoded and
upconverted to the original resolution using a deep upsampling neural network,
aided by the prior knowledge of the learned adaptive downsampling kernels. We
restrict the downsampling kernels to the form of Gabor filters in order to
reduce the complexity of filter optimization and also reduce the amount of side
information needed by the decoder for adaptive upsampling. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed ADDL compression approach of jointly
optimized, spatially adaptive downsampling and upconversion outperforms the
state of the art image compression methods.

such as dropout and batch normalization have been used in various tasks.
Nevertheless, the correct position to apply dropout has rarely been discussed,
and different positions have been employed depending on the practitioners. In
this study, we investigate the correct position to apply dropout. We
demonstrate that for a residual network with batch normalization, applying
dropout at certain positions increases the performance, whereas applying
dropout at other positions decreases the performance. Based on theoretical
analysis, we provide the following guideline for the correct position to apply
dropout: apply one dropout after the last batch normalization but before the
last weight layer in the residual branch. We provide detailed theoretical
explanations to support this claim and demonstrate them through module tests.
In addition, we investigate the correct position of dropout in the head that
produces the final prediction. Although the current consensus is to apply

physics. Here, we reported a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of
the TeV-emitting bright GRB 190114C. Its high fluence ($\sim$
4.436$\times$10$^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$) allows us to conduct the time-resolved
spectral analysis in great detail and study their variations down to a very
short time-scale ($\sim$0.1 s) while preserving a high significance. Its prompt
emission consists of three well-separated pulses. The first two main pulses
($P_1$ and $P_2$) exhibit independently strong thermal components, and starting
from the third pulse ($P_3$) and extending to the entire afterglow, the spectra
are all non-thermal, the synchrotron plus Compton up-scattering model well
interpret the observation. By combining the thermal ($P_1$ and $P_2$) and the
non-thermal ($P_3$) observations based on two different scenarios (global and
pulse properties) and following the method described in \cite{Zhang2021}, we
measure the fireball parameters and GRB radiative efficiency with little
uncertainties for this GRB. A relevantly high GRB radiative efficiency is
obtained based on both the global and pulse properties, suggesting that if GRBs
are powered by fireballs, the efficiency can be high sometimes. More
interestingly, though the observed parameters are individually different (e.g.,
the amount of mass loading $M$), the radiative efficiency obtained from $P_1$
($\eta_\gamma=36.0\pm6.5\%$) and $P_2$ ($\eta_\gamma=41.1\pm1.9\%$) is roughly

number of vertices. It can describe n-ary relationships and high-order
information among entities compared to conventional graphs. In this paper, we
study the fundamental problem of subgraph matching on hypergraphs (i.e,
subhypergraph matching). Existing methods directly extend subgraph matching
algorithms to the case of hypergraphs. However, this approach delays hyperedge
verification and underutilises the high-order information in hypergraphs, which
leads to large search space and high enumeration cost. Furthermore, with the
growing size of hypergraphs, it is becoming hard to compute subhypergraph
matching sequentially. Thus, we propose an efficient and parallel subhypergraph
matching system, HGMatch, to handle subhypergraph matching in massive
hypergraphs. We proposes a novel match-by-hyperedge framework to utilise
high-order information in hypergraphs and uses set operations for efficient
candidates generation. Moreover, we develop an optimised parallel execution
engine in HGMatch based on the dataflow model, which features a task-based
scheduler and fine-grained dynamic work stealing to achieve bounded memory
execution and better load balancing. Experimental evaluation on 10 real-world
datasets shows that HGMatch outperforms the extended version of the

scalability when the number of threads increases.

coordinate-free covariant tensorial calculus. When the analysis is applied to
that of pseudoholomorphic curves $u = (w,f)$ with $w = \pi_Q \circ u$, $f =
s\circ u$ on symplectization, the outcome is generally stronger and more
accurate than the common results on the regularity presented in the literature

involving $f$. The a priori elliptic estimates for $w$ are largely consequences
of various Weitzenb\""ock-type formulae with respect to the contact triad

model, which exhibits a shear stress overshoot during startup, our nonlinear
simulations show that transient shear banding is absent regardless of whether
the start-up shear rate is in the monotonic or nonmonotonic regions of the
constitutive curve. In the latter case, while there is clearly an inhomogeneity
en route to the banded state, the extent of shear banding is not substantially
large compared to that of the eventual banded state. Marked inhomogeneity in
the velocity profile is predicted for the non-stretching Rolie-Poly model only
if the solvent to solution viscosity ratio is smaller than O(10^(-3), but its
occurrence does not appear to have any correlation with the stress overshoot
during startup. These inhomogeneities are also very sensitive to initial

asserted that a shadow can test the validity of the theory's famous `no hair

we assess this statement by calculating the shadow's equatorial radius in

into account, the shadow acquires a high degree of degeneracy as a function of
the deviation from the Kerr multipole moments. The results of our analysis

potential, is taken as the zeroth-order approximation. Explicit expressions are
given for the total energy through 3rd-order, which satisfy the 2N + 1 rule
(i.e. requiring only the 1st-order perturbed wave function for determining the
energy through 3rd-order). Expressions for additional 2nd-order corrections to
the perturbed wave function (as well as related one-electron properties) are
worked out at the uncoupled-perturbed level of theory. The approach is
implemented in the \textsc{Crystal} program and validated with calculations of
the total energy, electronic band structure, and density variables of
spin-current DFT on the tungsten dichalcogenide hexagonal bilayer series (i.e.
WSe$_2$, WTe$_2$, WPo$_2$, WLv$_2$), including 6p and 7p elements as a stress
test. The computed properties through second- or third-order match well with
those from reference two-component self-consistent field (2c-SCF) calculations.
For total energies, $E^{(3)}$ was found to consistently improve the agreement
against the 2c-SCF reference values. For electronic band structures, visible
differences w.r.t. 2c-SCF remained through second-order in only the single-most
difficult case of WLv$_2$. As for density variables of spin-current DFT, the
perturbed electron density, being vanishing in first-order, is the most
challenging for the perturbation theory approach. The visible differences in
the electron densities are, however, largest close to the core region of atoms
and smaller in the valence region. Perturbed spin-current densities, on the
other hand, are well reproduced in all tested cases.

the original one (also known as the Green's function approach available only
for bulk inhomogeneous lossy dielectric medium) was to add fluctuating sources
in reaction to the radiation loss. Consequently, a resulting electric field
operator is now determined by (i) boundary-assisted and (ii) medium-assisted
fields on an equal footing, which are fluctuating sources due to radiation and
medium losses, respectively. However, due to the lengthy mathematical
manipulation and complicated concepts, the validity of the modified Langevin
noise formalism has not been clearly checked yet.
  In this work, we propose and develop a novel numerical framework for the
modified Langevin noise formalism by exploiting computational electromagnetic
methods (CEM). Specifically, we utilize the finite-element method to
numerically solve plane-wave-scattering and point-source-radiation problems
whose solutions are boundary-assisted and medium-assisted fields, respectively.
Based on the developed numerical framework, we calculate the Purcell factor of
a two-level atom inside or outside a lossy dielectric slab. It is numerically
proved, for the first time, that one can retrieve the conventional expression
of the spontaneous emission rate, viz., the imaginary part of the Green's
function.
  The proposed numerical framework is particularly useful for estimating the
dynamics of multi-level atoms near practical plasmonic structures or
metasurfaces.

backbones for RGB and depth modalities with the same Places or ImageNet
pre-training. However, the pre-trained depth network is still biased by
RGB-based models which may result in a suboptimal solution. In this paper, we
present a single-model self-supervised hybrid pre-training framework for RGB
and depth modalities, termed as CoMAE. Our CoMAE presents a curriculum learning
strategy to unify the two popular self-supervised representation learning
algorithms: contrastive learning and masked image modeling. Specifically, we
first build a patch-level alignment task to pre-train a single encoder shared
by two modalities via cross-modal contrastive learning. Then, the pre-trained
contrastive encoder is passed to a multi-modal masked autoencoder to capture
the finer context features from a generative perspective. In addition, our
single-model design without requirement of fusion module is very flexible and
robust to generalize to unimodal scenario in both training and testing phases.
Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D and NYUDv2 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoMAE for RGB and depth representation learning. In
addition, our experiment results reveal that CoMAE is a data-efficient
representation learner. Although we only use the small-scale and unlabeled

steps. The first step considers the geometric consensus of graph-like
constellations formed by contours in particular localities. The second step
models the majority of contours as a 2.5D Gaussian mixture model, which is used
to calculate correlation and optimize relative transform in continuous space. A

The SGBH equation has the nonlinearity of polynomial order and noise considered
in this work is infinite dimensional with a coefficient having linear growth.
First, we prove the existence of a \textsl{unique local mild solution} in the
sense of Walsh to SGBH equation with the help of a truncation argument and
contraction mapping principle. Then the global solvability results are
established by using uniform bounds of the local mild solution, stopping time
arguments, tightness properties and Skorokhod's representation theorem.
  By using the uniform Laplace principle, we obtain the \textsl{large deviation
principle} (LDP) for the law of solutions to SGBH equation by using variational
representation methods. Further, we derive the \textsl{uniform large deviation
principle} (ULDP) for the law of solutions in two different topologies by using
a weak convergence method. First, in the $\mathrm{C}([0, T
];\mathrm{L}^p([0,1])) $ topology where the uniformity is over
$\mathrm{L}^p([0,1])$-bounded sets of initial conditions, and secondly in the

subsets in the $\mathrm{C}([0,1])$-norm.
  Finally, we consider SGBH equation perturbed by a space-time white noise with
bounded noise coefficient and establish the ULDP for the laws of solutions. The
results obtained in this work hold true for stochastic Burgers' as well as

embedded to $Ax$, where $A$ is an $m \times d$ matrix having $s$ non-zeros per
column, allowing for an embedding time of $O(s \|x\|_0)$.
  Since the sparsity of $A$ governs the embedding time, much work has gone into
improving the sparsity $s$. The current state-of-the-art by Kane and Nelson
(JACM'14) shows that $s = O(\varepsilon ^{-1} \lg n)$ suffices. This is almost
matched by a lower bound of $s = \Omega(\varepsilon ^{-1} \lg
n/\lg(1/\varepsilon))$ by Nelson and Nguyen (STOC'13). Previous work thus
suggests that we have near-optimal embeddings.
  In this work, we revisit sparse embeddings and identify a loophole in the
lower bound. Concretely, it requires $d \geq n$, which in many applications is
unrealistic. We exploit this loophole to give a sparser embedding when $d =
o(n)$, achieving $s = O(\varepsilon^{-1}(\lg n/\lg(1/\varepsilon)+\lg^{2/3}n
\lg^{1/3} d))$. We also complement our analysis by strengthening the lower

has been addressed, wherein the training has been performed for predicting the
three indices: 13-month running sunspot number, ionospheric index, and daily
solar radio flux also called targets to the network when hourly TEC values are
the inputs. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of these targets have been
compared and minimized after several training of the dataset using different

0.90% errors for Rz12, IG12, and F10.7 radio flux, respectively, thus
signifying ~97% prediction accuracy of the model.

instances of the random graph $G(n,d/n)$ and for fugacity $\lambda <
\frac{d^d}{(d-1)^{d+1}}$, the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is $n^{1 +
O(1/\log \log n)}$.
  Our result improves on the recent elegant algorithm in [Bezakova, Galanis,
Goldberg Stefankovic; ICALP'22]. The algorithm there is a MCMC based sampling
algorithm, but it is not the Glauber dynamics. Our algorithm here is simpler,
as we use the classic Glauber dynamics. Furthermore, the bounds on mixing time
we prove are smaller than those in Bezakova et al. paper, hence our algorithm
is also faster.
  The main challenge in our proof is handling vertices with unbounded degrees.
We provide stronger results with regard the spectral independence via branching
values and show that the our Gibbs distributions satisfy the approximate
tensorisation of the entropy. We conjecture that the bounds we have here are
optimal for $G(n,d/n)$.
  As corollary of our analysis for the Hard-core model, we also get bounds on
the mixing time of the Glauber dynamics for the Monomer-dimer model on
$G(n,d/n)$. The bounds we get for this model are slightly better than those we
have for the Hard-core model

longer time and more resources, making fault tolerance more and more critical.
Existing state-of-the-art methods like CheckFreq and Elastic Horovod need to
back up a copy of the model state (i.e., parameters and optimizer states) in
memory, which is costly for large models and leads to non-trivial overhead.
This paper presents SWIFT, a novel recovery design for distributed deep neural
network training that significantly reduces the failure recovery overhead
without affecting training throughput and model accuracy. Instead of making an
additional copy of the model state, SWIFT resolves the inconsistencies of the
model state caused by the failure and exploits the replicas of the model state
in data parallelism for failure recovery. We propose a logging-based approach
when replicas are unavailable, which records intermediate data and replays the
computation to recover the lost state upon a failure. The re-computation is
distributed across multiple machines to accelerate failure recovery further. We
also log intermediate data selectively, exploring the trade-off between
recovery time and intermediate data storage overhead. Evaluations show that
SWIFT significantly reduces the failure recovery time and achieves similar or
better training throughput during failure-free execution compared to
state-of-the-art methods without degrading final model accuracy. SWIFT can also
achieve up to 1.16x speedup in total training time compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

essentially amounts to flowfield-conditioned node sampling and sensor

tailored to the flowfield reconstruction task in the form of so-called masked

estimating the 3D position of human joints directly from images and videos. In
recent literature, most of the works tackle the problem mostly by using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are capable of achieving
state-of-the-art results in most datasets. We show how most neural networks are
not able to generalize well when the camera is subject to significant viewpoint
changes. This behaviour emerges because CNNs lack the capability of modelling
viewpoint equivariance, while they rather rely on viewpoint invariance,
resulting in high data dependency. Recently, capsule networks (CapsNets) have
been proposed in the multi-class classification field as a solution to the
viewpoint equivariance issue, reducing both the size and complexity of both the
training datasets and the network itself. In this work, we show how capsule
networks can be adopted to achieve viewpoint equivariance in human pose
estimation. We propose a novel end-to-end viewpoint-equivariant capsule
autoencoder that employs a fast Variational Bayes routing and matrix capsules.
We achieve state-of-the-art results for multiple tasks and datasets while
retaining other desirable properties, such as greater generalization
capabilities when changing viewpoints, lower data dependency and fast
inference. Additionally, by modelling each joint as a capsule, the hierarchical
and geometrical structure of the overall pose is retained in the feature space,
independently from the viewpoint. We further test our network on multiple
datasets, both in the RGB and depth domain, from seen and unseen viewpoints and
in the viewpoint transfer task.

predict a missing token in a pre-defined template given an input text, which

different tokens share a large proportion of similar information after going
through stacked multiple self-attention layers in a transformer, by proposing a

between the small and the large black hole state does not necessarily pass

two-qubit case, the Bell state of two long-distance qubits can be a dark state
of the system by choosing appropriate system parameters. If one proper
microwave pulse drives one of two qubits, the two qubits will evolve from the
ground state to the Bell state. Further, we extend this scheme to the
multi-qubit case, and the arbitrary multipartite $W$ state of long-distance
qubits can also be generated. Because both the Bell and arbitrary multipartite
$W$ states are decoupled from the waveguide (i.e., dark states of the system),
they are steady and have very long lifetimes in the ideal case without

Therefore, one would assume that this also holds for robot-patient
interactions. However, the medical robotic imaging field lacks research in the
area of acceptance. This work, therefore, aims at analyzing the influence of
robot-patient interactions on acceptance in an exemplary medical robotic
imaging system. Methods: We designed an interactive human-robot scenario,
including auditive and gestural cues, and compared this pipeline to a
non-interactive scenario. Both scenarios were evaluated through a questionnaire
to measure acceptance. Heart rate monitoring was also used to measure stress.
The impact of the interaction was quantified in the use case of robotic
ultrasound scanning of the neck. Results: We conducted the first user study on
patient acceptance of robotic ultrasound. Results show that verbal interactions
impacts trust more than gestural ones. Furthermore, through interaction, the
robot is perceived to be friendlier. The heart rate data indicates that
robot-patient interaction could reduce stress. Conclusion: Robot-patient
interactions are crucial for improving acceptance in medical robotic imaging
systems. While verbal interaction is most important, the preferred interaction
type and content are participant-dependent. Heart rate values indicate that
such interactions can also reduce stress. Overall, this initial work showed
that interactions improve patient acceptance in medical robotic imaging, and
other medical robot-patient systems can benefit from the design proposals to
enhance acceptance in interactive scenarios.

minimal model to capture the low-energy van-Hove-singularity dispersion and,
more importantly, the band topology in these Kagome metals. This model consists
of $A_g@3g$ (V-$d_{x^2-y^2/z^2}$, Kagome sites) and $A''_2@2d$ EBRs (Sb1-$p_z$,
honeycomb sites), which form an anti-crossing point on the M$-$L line. We have
investigated the Fermi surface instability by calculating the electronic
susceptibility $\chi_{\mathbf{q}}$. Prominent Fermi-surface nesting peaks are
obtained at three L points, where the $z$ component of the nesting vector shows
intimate relationship with the anti-crossing point. The nesting peaks at L are
consistent with the $2 \times 2 \times 2$ CDW reconstruction in these
compounds. In addition, the sublattice-resolved bare susceptibility is
calculated and similar sharp peaks are observed at the L points, indicating a
strong antiferromagnetic fluctuation. Moreover, our detailed first-principles
calculations show the CDW reconstruction can be initialized by slight
distortions of Sb1 atoms. Assuming a bulk $s$-wave superconducting pairing,
helical surface states and nontrivial superconducting gap are obtained on the
(001) surface. In analogous to FeTe$_{1-x}$Se$_x$ superconductor, our results
establish another material realization of a stoichiometric superconductor with
nontrivial band topology, providing a promising platform for studying exotic
Majorana physics in condensed matter.

around the star AF Lep that presents a significant proper motion anomaly (PMa)

Methods. We observed AF Lep in two epochs with VLT/SPHERE using its subsystems
IFS and IRDIS in the near-infrared (NIR) covering wavelengths ranging from the
Y to the K spectral bands (between 0.95 and 2.3 {\mu}m). The data were then
reduced using the high-contrast imaging techniques angular differential imaging
(ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI) to be able to retrieve the signal
from low mass companions of the star. Results. A faint companion was retrieved
at a separation of ~0.335"" from the star and with a position angle of ~70.5 deg
in the first epoch and with a similar position in the second epoch. This
corresponds to a projected separation of ~9 au. The extracted photometry
allowed us to estimate for the companion a mass between 2 and 5 MJup. This mass
is in good agreement with what is expected for the dynamic mass of the
companion deduced using astrometric measures (5.2-5.5 MJup). This is the first
companion with a mass well below the deuterium burning limit discovered
coupling direct imaging with PMa measures. Orbit fitting done using the orvara
tool allowed to further confirm the companion mass and to define its main
orbital parameters.

Because of significant accretion and ejection activity of massive black holes,
some dwarf galaxies also host low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In
a few dwarf AGNs, very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations have
found faint non-thermal radio emission. SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 is a dwarf AGN
owning an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) with a mass of $M_{BH} =
3.6^{+5.9}_{-2.3} \times 10^5 M_{sun}$ and showing a rarely-seen two-component
radio structure in its radio nucleus. To further probe their nature, i.e. the
IMBH jet activity, we performed additional deep observations with the European
VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.66 GHz and 4.99 GHz. We find the more diffuse emission
regions and structure details. These new EVN imaging results allow us to reveal
a two-sided jet morphology with a size up to about 150 mas (projected length
$\sim$140 pc) and a radio luminosity of about $3\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
The peak feature has an optically thin radio spectrum and thus more likely
represents a relatively young ejecta instead of a jet base. The EVN study on
SDSS J090613.77+561015.2 demonstrates the existence of episodic, relatively
large-scale and powerful IMBH jet activity in dwarf AGNs. Moreover, we
collected a small sample of VLBI-detected dwarf AGNs and investigated their
connections with normal AGNs. We notice that these radio sources in the dwarf
AGNs tend to have steep spectra and small linear sizes, and possibly represent
ejecta from scaled-down episodic jet activity.

sequence models in many tasks, such as NLP, image classification, and
video/audio processing, for their fast training and superior performance. Much
of the merit is attributable to positional encoding and multi-head attention.
However, Transformers fall short in learning long-range dependencies mainly due
to the quadratic complexity scaled with context length, in terms of both time
and space. Consequently, over the past five years, a myriad of methods has been
proposed to make Transformers more efficient. In this work, we first take a
step back, study and compare existing solutions to long-sequence modeling in
terms of their pure mathematical formulation. Specifically, we summarize them
using a unified template, given their shared nature of token mixing. Through
benchmarks, we then demonstrate that long context length does yield better
performance, albeit application-dependent, and traditional Transformer models
fall short in taking advantage of long-range dependencies. Next, inspired by
emerging sparse models of huge capacity, we propose a machine learning system
for handling million-scale dependencies. As a proof of concept, we evaluate the
performance of one essential component of this system, namely, the distributed
multi-head attention. We show that our algorithm can scale up attention

the Forster resonant energy transfer(FRET) rate and the distance dependence in
the vicinity of metal surfaces. The high density of evanescent near-field modes
in the vicinity of a metal surface can strongly modulate the FRET in
multichromophoric systems. Based on the previous generalized FRET [A. Poudel,
X. Chen and M. Ratner, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 7(2016) 955], the theory of FRET is
generalized for the multichromophore aggregates and nonequilibrium situations
in the vicinity of evanescent surface electromagnetic waves of nanophotonic
structures. The classic dyadic green function (DGF) approach to
multichromophoric FRET (MC-FRET) in the existence of evanescent near-field is
established. The classic DGF approach provides a microscopic understanding of
the interaction between the emission and absorption spectral coupling and the
evanescent electromagnetic field. The MC-FRET of the ring structures
demonstrates complicated distance dependence in the vicinity of the silver thin
film. Given the analytic expression of hyperbolic multi-layer thin film, the
generalized coupling due to the metallic thin film is determined by the
scattering DGF above the metal surface. The decomposition of the reduced
scattering DGF by ignoring $S$ wave in the evanescent wave shows how the
interface of the metallic thin films modulates the MC-FRET.

detection even at relatively small abundances. It has been detected towards

distributed in several clumps that lie off-center from the star. We aim to
study the three-dimensional distribution of NaCl around the AGB star IK Tau,
and to obtain the abundance of NaCl relative to H$_2$ for each of the clumps.
First, a new value for the maximum expansion velocity is determined. The
observed ALMA channel maps are then deprojected to create a three-dimensional
model of the distribution of NaCl. This model is then used as input for the
radiative transfer modelling code magritte, which is used to obtain the NaCl
abundances of each of the clumps by comparing the observations with the results
of the magritte simulations. Additionally, the rotational temperature of the
clumps is determined using population diagrams. We derive an updated value for
the maximum expansion velocity of IK Tau $\upsilon_\mathrm{exp}$ = 28.4 km/s. A
spiral-like shape can be discerned in our three-dimensional distribution model
of the NaCl. This spiral lies more or less in the plane of the sky. The
distribution is also flatter in the line-of-sight direction than in the plane
of the sky. We find clump abundances between $9 \times 10^{-9}$ and $5 \times
10^{-8}$ relative to H$_2$, where the relative abundance is typically lower for
clumps closer to the star. For the first time, we used deprojection to
understand the three-dimensional environment of an AGB star and calculated the

observations from more than 30 professional and amateur telescopes) and the
Insight-HXMT Collaboration. We study the optical afterglow with empirical
fitting from GRANDMA+HXMT data, augmented with data from the literature up to
60 days. We then model numerically, using a Bayesian approach, the GRANDMA and
HXMT-LE afterglow observations, that we augment with Swift-XRT and additional
optical/NIR observations reported in the literature. We find that the GRB
afterglow, extinguished by a large dust column, is most likely behind a
combination of a large Milky-Way dust column combined with moderate
low-metallicity dust in the host galaxy. Using the GRANDMA+HXMT-LE+XRT dataset,
we find that the simplest model, where the observed afterglow is produced by
synchrotron radiation at the forward external shock during the deceleration of
a top-hat relativistic jet by a uniform medium, fits the multi-wavelength
observations only moderately well, with a tension between the observed temporal
and spectral evolution. This tension is confirmed when using the extended
dataset. We find that the consideration of a jet structure (Gaussian or
power-law), the inclusion of synchrotron self-Compton emission, or the presence
of an underlying supernova do not improve the predictions, showing that the
modelling of GRB22109A will require going beyond the most standard GRB
afterglow model. Placed in the global context of GRB optical afterglows, we
find the afterglow of GRB 221009A is luminous but not extraordinarily so,
highlighting that some aspects of this GRB do not deviate from the global known
sample despite its extreme energetics and the peculiar afterglow evolution.

intricate social influence dynamics, particularly so when the community

of these markets improbable. In this paper, we remedy this by establishing
robust connections between influence dynamics and optimization processes, in
trial-offer markets where the consumer preferences are modelled by multinomial
logit. Among other results, we show that the proportional-response-esque
influence dynamic is equivalent to stochastic mirror descent on a convex
objective function, thus leading to a stable and predictable outcome. When all

the most suitable model to answer each query. The models are also mapped onto a
non-Euclidean manifold, the Poincar\'e ball, to capture structural patterns,

that our combination provides a higher expressiveness and inference power than

demonstrate that this is possible. In doing so, we identify several pathologies

initially investigated more than twenty years ago. It was shown that this

lengths and its linearized system is not controllable for {\it all} critical
lengths. Even though the controllability of the KdV system has been studied
extensively in the last two decades, the local controllability of this system
for critical lengths remains an open question. In this paper, we give a
definitive answer to this question. First, we characterize all critical lengths
and the corresponding unreachable space for the linearized system. In
particular, we show that the unreachable space is always of dimension 1.
Second, we prove that the KdV system with the right Dirichlet control is not
locally null controllable in small time. Third, we give a criterion to
determine whether the system is locally exactly controllable in finite time or
{\it not} locally null controllable in any positive time for {\it all} critical

system is not locally null controllable in small time but is locally exactly
controllable in finite time. These facts are surprising and distinct in
comparison with related known results. First, it is known that the
corresponding KdV system with the right zero Dirichlet is locally exactly
controllable in small time using internal controls. Second, the unreachable
space of the linearized system of the corresponding KdV system with the right
Neumann control might be of arbitrary dimension. Third, the KdV system with the

dual field continuous Galerkin discretization is introduced, in which one
variable is approximated via conforming finite element spaces, whereas the
second is completely local. This scheme retains a discrete power balance and
discrete conservation laws and is directly amenable to hybridization. The
hybrid formulation is equivalent to the continuous Galerkin formulation and to
a power preserving interconnection of port-Hamiltonian systems, thus providing
a system theoretic interpretation of finite element assembly. The hybrid system
can be efficiently solved using a static condensation procedure in discrete
time. The size reduction achieved thanks to the hybridization is greater than
the one obtained for the Hodge Laplacian as one field is completely discarded.
Numerical experiments on the 3D wave and Maxwell equations show the equivalence
of the continuous and hybrid formulation and the computational gain achieved by
the latter.

[Iwama,89]. A hitting formula is a set of Boolean clauses such that any two of
them cannot be simultaneously falsified. [Peitl,Szeider,05] conjectured that
hitting formulas should contain the hardest formulas for resolution. They
supported their conjecture with experimental findings. Using the fact that
hitting formulas are easy to check for satisfiability we use them to build a
static proof system Hitting: a refutation of a CNF in Hitting is an
unsatisfiable hitting formula such that each of its clauses is a weakening of a
clause of the refuted CNF. Comparing this system to resolution and other proof
systems is equivalent to studying the hardness of hitting formulas.
  We show that tree-like resolution and Hitting are quasi-polynomially
separated. We prove that Hitting is quasi-polynomially simulated by tree-like
resolution, thus hitting formulas cannot be exponentially hard for resolution,
so Peitl-Szeider's conjecture is partially refuted. Nevertheless Hitting is
surprisingly difficult to polynomially simulate. Using the ideas of PIT for
noncommutative circuits [Raz-Shpilka,05] we show that Hitting is simulated by
Extended Frege. As a byproduct, we show that a number of static (semi)algebraic
systems are verifiable in a deterministic polynomial time.
  We consider multiple extensions of Hitting. Hitting(+) formulas are
conjunctions of clauses containing affine equations instead of just literals,
and every assignment falsifies at most one clause. The resulting system is
related to Res(+) proof system for which no superpolynomial lower bounds are
known: Hitting(+) simulates the tree-like version of Res(+) and is at least
quasi-polynomially stronger. We show an exponential lower bound for Hitting(+).

  Neural Network for Chemical Fault Detection and Diagnosis",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault detection and diagnosis is significant for reducing maintenance costs
and improving health and safety in chemical processes. Convolution neural
network (CNN) is a popular deep learning algorithm with many successful
applications in chemical fault detection and diagnosis tasks. However,
convolution layers in CNN are very sensitive to the order of features, which
can lead to instability in the processing of tabular data. Optimal order of
features result in better performance of CNN models but it is expensive to seek
such optimal order. In addition, because of the encapsulation mechanism of
feature extraction, most CNN models are opaque and have poor interpretability,
thus failing to identify root-cause features without human supervision. These
difficulties inevitably limit the performance and credibility of CNN methods.
In this paper, we propose an order-invariant and interpretable hierarchical
dilated convolution neural network (HDLCNN), which is composed by feature
clustering, dilated convolution and the shapley additive explanations (SHAP)
method. The novelty of HDLCNN lies in its capability of processing tabular data
with features of arbitrary order without seeking the optimal order, due to the
ability to agglomerate correlated features of feature clustering and the large
receptive field of dilated convolution. Then, the proposed method provides
interpretability by including the SHAP values to quantify feature contribution.
Therefore, the root-cause features can be identified as the features with the
highest contribution. Computational experiments are conducted on the Tennessee
Eastman chemical process benchmark dataset. Compared with the other methods,
the proposed HDLCNN-SHAP method achieves better performance on processing
tabular data with features of arbitrary order, detecting faults, and
identifying the root-cause features.

architectures in such cases. To allow continuous time, the authors introduce
specific parametric intensity functions defined at each moment on top of
existing models. Due to the parametric nature, these intensities represent only
a limited class of event sequences.
  We propose the COTIC method based on a continuous convolution neural network
suitable for non-uniform occurrence of events in time. In COTIC, dilations and
multi-layer architecture efficiently handle dependencies between events.
Furthermore, the model provides general intensity dynamics in continuous time -
including self-excitement encountered in practice.
  The COTIC model outperforms existing approaches on majority of the considered
datasets, producing embeddings for an event sequence that can be used to solve
downstream tasks - e.g. predicting next event type and return time. The code of
the proposed method can be found in the GitHub repository
(https://github.com/VladislavZh/COTIC).

uniqueness of strong solutions are obtained under the smallness of the gradient

framework. The discriminator is often trained by taking expert demonstrations
and policy trajectories as examples respectively from two categories (positive
vs. negative) and the policy is then expected to produce trajectories that are
indistinguishable from the expert demonstrations. But in the real world, the
collected expert demonstrations are more likely to be imperfect, where only an
unknown fraction of the demonstrations are optimal. Instead of treating
imperfect expert demonstrations as absolutely positive or negative, we
investigate unlabeled imperfect expert demonstrations as they are. A
positive-unlabeled adversarial imitation learning algorithm is developed to
dynamically sample expert demonstrations that can well match the trajectories
from the constantly optimized agent policy. The trajectories of an initial
agent policy could be closer to those non-optimal expert demonstrations, but
within the framework of adversarial imitation learning, agent policy will be
optimized to cheat the discriminator and produce trajectories that are similar
to those optimal expert demonstrations. Theoretical analysis shows that our
method learns from the imperfect demonstrations via a self-paced way.
Experimental results on MuJoCo and RoboSuite platforms demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method from different aspects.

that can acquire the real-time ECG signal and display it on the mobile screen

nurse to install the electrodes using the simplest and cheapest type of ICs and
transmitters including STM32F030F4P6 microcontroller, AD620 instrumentation

HC-05 Bluetooth module. Moreover, the device was designed in a way that could
operate using a single 9V battery or power adaptor. First, to amplify the
signal and remove a part of its noise, the ECG signal is given to the primary
analog circuit. Then, in the digital section, using a microcontroller, the
signal is discretized, processed, and finally transmitted to a mobile phone for
final processing, information extraction, and displaying. In the mobile-written
application, we developed a mathematical algorithm based on Pan-Tompkins
algorithm to calculate the heartbeat rate, in which the signal peaks are
determined after several processing steps using a threshold. In this regard,
the ECG signals of 10 subjects were recorded and analyzed to calculate the
optimum threshold. Finally, the power spectral density (PSD) and input referred
noise were calculated and plotted to check the output signal quality. Based on
the PSD and input referred noise amplitudes, we achieved a signal-to-noise

unique insights into power system variables influencing the entire stability

impacts the stability boundary throughout the network. Such insights can inform

including image and speech recognition. However, optimizing the performance of
DNNs requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters and network parameters
via training. High-performance DNNs utilize a large number of parameters,
corresponding to high energy consumption during training. To address these
limitations, researchers have developed spiking neural networks (SNNs), which
are more energy-efficient and can process data in a biologically plausible
manner, making them well-suited for tasks involving sensory data processing,
i.e., neuromorphic data. Like DNNs, SNNs are vulnerable to various threats,
such as adversarial examples and backdoor attacks. Yet, the attacks and
countermeasures for SNNs have been almost fully unexplored.
  This paper investigates the application of backdoor attacks in SNNs using
neuromorphic datasets and different triggers. More precisely, backdoor triggers
in neuromorphic data can change their position and color, allowing a larger
range of possibilities than common triggers in, e.g., the image domain. We
propose different attacks achieving up to 100\% attack success rate without
noticeable clean accuracy degradation. We also evaluate the stealthiness of the
attacks via the structural similarity metric, showing our most powerful attacks
being also stealthy. Finally, we adapt the state-of-the-art defenses from the
image domain, demonstrating they are not necessarily effective for neuromorphic
data resulting in inaccurate performance.

accurate initial guesses as well as generating various types of pseudopotential
approximations and efficient atomic-orbital basis sets for polyatomic
calculations. To reach the best accuracy for these purposes, the atomic
calculations should employ the same density functional as the polyatomic
calculation. Atomic density functional calculations are typically carried out
employing spherically symmetric densities, corresponding to the use of
fractional orbital occupations. We have described their implementation for
density functional approximations (DFAs) belonging to the local density
approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) levels of
theory as well as Hartree-Fock (HF) and range-separated exact exchange [S.
Lehtola, Phys. Rev. A 2020, 101, 012516]. In this work, we describe the
extension to meta-GGA functionals using the generalized Kohn-Sham scheme, in
which the energy is minimized with respect to the orbitals, which in turn are
expanded in the finite element formalism with high-order numerical basis
functions. Furnished with the new implementation, we continue our recent work

be ill-behaved for the Li and Na atoms. We report basis set truncation errors

importance of density thresholding in DFAs and find that all of the functionals

Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Learning in which the adversary is
restricted to a known family of marginal distributions $\mathscr{P}$. In
particular, we study how the PAC-learnability of a triple $(\mathscr{P},X,H)$
relates to the learners ability to infer \emph{distributional} information
about the adversary's choice of $D \in \mathscr{P}$. To this end, we introduce
the `unsupervised' notion of \emph{TV-Learning}, which, given a class
$(\mathscr{P},X,H)$, asks the learner to approximate $D$ from unlabeled samples
with respect to a natural class-conditional total variation metric.
  In the classical distribution-free setting, we show that TV-learning is
\emph{equivalent} to PAC-Learning: in other words, any learner must infer
near-maximal information about $D$. On the other hand, we show this
characterization breaks down for general $\mathscr{P}$, where PAC-Learning is
strictly sandwiched between two approximate variants we call `Strong' and
`Weak' TV-learning, roughly corresponding to unsupervised learners that
estimate most relevant distances in $D$ with respect to $H$, but differ in
whether the learner \emph{knows} the set of well-estimated events. Finally, we
observe that TV-learning is in fact equivalent to the classical notion of
\emph{uniform estimation}, and thereby give a strong refutation of the uniform
convergence paradigm in supervised learning.

experimentally-demonstrated circuit elements: Josephson junctions, capacitors
and $0-\pi$ qubits. The interactions occurring naturally in the QEC array, due
to tunneling of Cooper-pairs and pairs of Cooper-pairs, give rise to a
non-integrable, interacting, lattice model of quantum rotors. In the scaling
limit, the latter is described by the quantum sine-Gordon model, perturbed by a
cosine potential with a different periodicity. We compute the string tension of
confinement of sine-Gordon solitons and the changes in the low-lying spectrum

vision applications including robotics, autonomous cars, and augmented reality.
This work addresses the object detection task in 3D point clouds using a highly
efficient, surface-biased, feature extraction method (wang2022rbgnet), that
also captures contextual cues on multiple levels. We propose a 3D object
detector that extracts accurate feature representations of object candidates
and leverages self-attention on point patches, object candidates, and on the
global scene in 3D scene. Self-attention is proven to be effective in encoding
correlation information in 3D point clouds by (xie2020mlcvnet). While other 3D
detectors focus on enhancing point cloud feature extraction by selectively
obtaining more meaningful local features (wang2022rbgnet) where contextual
information is overlooked. To this end, the proposed architecture uses
ray-based surface-biased feature extraction and multi-level context encoding to
outperform the state-of-the-art 3D object detector. In this work, 3D detection
experiments are performed on scenes from the ScanNet dataset whereby the
self-attention modules are introduced one after the other to isolate the effect
of self-attention at each level.

affects the solute transport and solvent evaporation profile. Hence, it should
have a strong impact on the deposit formation and might be responsible for
volcano-like, dome-like and at deposit morphologies.
  Experiments: A method based on a thin-film interference was used to track the
drop height profile and contact line motion during the drying. A diverse set of
drying scenarios was obtained by using inks with different solvent compositions
and by adjusting the substrate wetting properties. The experimental data was
compared to the predictions of phenomenological model.
  Findings: We highlight the essential role of contact-line mobility on the
deposit morphology of solution-based inks. A pinned contact line produces
exclusively ring-like deposits under normal conditions. On the contrary, drops
with a mobile contact line can produce ring-, at- or dome-like morphology. The
developed phenomenological model shows that the deposit morphology depends on
solvent evaporation profile, evolution of the drop radius relative to its
contact angle, and the ratio between initial and maximal (gelling) solute
concentration. These parameters can be adjusted by the ink solvent composition
and substrate wetting behaviour, which provides a way for deposition of uniform
and at deposits via inkjet printing.

increasingly prevalent for its capability to integrate high-frequency spatial
information from the paired high-resolution (HR) RGB reference image. However,
most of the existing methods either heavily rely on the accurate alignment
between low-resolution (LR) HSIs and RGB images, or can only deal with
simulated unaligned RGB images generated by rigid geometric transformations,
which weakens their effectiveness for real scenes. In this paper, we explore
the fusion-based HSI super-resolution with real RGB reference images that have
both rigid and non-rigid misalignments. To properly address the limitations of
existing methods for unaligned reference images, we propose an HSI fusion
network with heterogenous feature extractions, multi-stage feature alignments,
and attentive feature fusion. Specifically, our network first transforms the
input HSI and RGB images into two sets of multi-scale features with an HSI
encoder and an RGB encoder, respectively. The features of RGB reference images
are then processed by a multi-stage alignment module to explicitly align the
features of RGB reference with the LR HSI. Finally, the aligned features of RGB
reference are further adjusted by an adaptive attention module to focus more on
discriminative regions before sending them to the fusion decoder to generate
the reconstructed HR HSI. Additionally, we collect a real-world HSI fusion
dataset, consisting of paired HSI and unaligned RGB reference, to support the
evaluation of the proposed model for real scenes. Extensive experiments are
conducted on both simulated and our real-world datasets, and it shows that our
method obtains a clear improvement over existing single-image and fusion-based
super-resolution methods on quantitative assessment as well as visual
comparison.

has shown great potential in learning on HG. Current studies of HGNN mainly
focus on some HGs with strong homophily properties (nodes connected by
meta-path tend to have the same labels), while few discussions are made in
those that are less homophilous. Recently, there have been many works on
homogeneous graphs with heterophily. However, due to heterogeneity, it is
non-trivial to extend their approach to deal with HGs with heterophily. In this
work, based on empirical observations, we propose a meta-path-induced metric to
measure the homophily degree of a HG. We also find that current HGNNs may have
degenerated performance when handling HGs with less homophilous properties.
Thus it is essential to increase the generalization ability of HGNNs on
non-homophilous HGs. To this end, we propose HDHGR, a homophily-oriented deep
heterogeneous graph rewiring approach that modifies the HG structure to
increase the performance of HGNN. We theoretically verify HDHGR. In addition,
experiments on real-world HGs demonstrate the effectiveness of HDHGR, which
brings at most more than 10% relative gain.

systems mainly from the literature. Using the Gaia eDR3 astrometric data and
radial velocities of our sample, as well as all the sources in a specific
region of the sky, we reconstructed the relative linear motions in the last 5
Myr and made predictions for the next 2 Myr. Relating the Hill radius of each
debris disk system and the closest distances reached by the two sources, we
defined the flyby events in terms of position and time. We find that in the
period between the last 5 Myrs and the next 2 Myrs, 90% of the analyzed systems
have experienced at least a close flyby, while 7% of them have experienced
flybys at distances greater than 0.5R Hill. In particular, 75% of them have

misalignments between disk and planet, stirring, or asymmetries. Systems with a
misalignment between the planetary orbit and the disk do indeed experience at

with the disk inclination higher than about 20 degree, as in the case of HD

describes the dynamics of plasmon modes in the coupled and uncoupled state.
Later, we compare the evolution of the system under continuous wave and pulsed

clamped plate with least principal eigenvalue is the ball. The conjecture has
been shown to hold in 1995 by Nadirashvili in dimension $2$ and by Ashbaugh and
Benguria in dimension $3$. Since then, the conjecture remains open in dimension
$d\geq 4$. In this paper, we contribute to answer this question, and show that
the conjecture is true in any dimension as long as some special condition holds
on the principal eigenfunction of an optimal shape. This condition regards the
mean value of the eigenfunction, asking it to be in some sense minimal. This
main result is based on an order reduction principle allowing to convert the
initial fourth order linear problem into a second order affine problem, for
which the classical machinery of shape optimization and elliptic theory is
available. The order reduction principle turns out to be a general tool. In
particular, it is used to derive another sufficient condition for the
conjecture to hold, which is a second main result. This condition requires the
Laplacian of the optimal eigenfunction to have constant normal derivative on
the boundary. Besides our main two results, we detail shape derivation tools
allowing to prove simplicity for the principal eigenvalue of an optimal shape
and to derive optimality conditions. Eventually, because our first result
involves the principal eigenfunction of a ball, we are led to compute it
explicitly.

NHSE is a topological effect owing to the non-trivial spectral winding, and
such spectral behaviors appear naturally in non-reciprocal systems. Hence
prevailing approaches rely on non-reciprocity to achieve the NHSE. Here, we
report the experimental realization of the geometry-dependent skin effect
(GDSE) in a two-dimensional (2D) reciprocal system, in which the skin effect
occurs only at boundaries whose macroscopic symmetry mismatches with the
lattice symmetry. The role of spectral reciprocity and symmetry is revealed by
connecting reflective channels at given boundaries with the spectral topology

loop invariants; in particular, invariants described by polynomial relations

software verification. In this paper we advocate an alternative solution to
invariant generation. Rather than inferring invariants from loops, we
synthesise loops from invariants. As such, we generate loops that satisfy a
given set of polynomials; in other words, our synthesised loops are correct by
construction.
  Our work turns the problem of loop synthesis into a symbolic computation
challenge. We employ techniques from algebraic geometry to synthesise loops
whose polynomial invariants are described by pure difference binomials. We show
that such complex polynomial invariants need ``only'' linear loops, opening up
new venues in program optimisation. We prove the existence of non-trivial loops
with linear updates for polynomial invariants generated by pure difference

corrections in the screened Coulomb interaction $W$. This is achieved by
solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the polarization matrix at all
$k$-points in the Brillouin zone. We refer to this method as QS$G\hat{W}$.
QS$GW$ yields a reasonable and consistent description of the electronic
structure and optical response, but systematic errors in several properties
appear, notably a tendency to overestimate insulating bandgaps, blue-shift
plasmon peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric function, and
underestimate the dielectric constant $\epsilon_{\infty}$. A primary objective
of this paper is to assess to what extent including ladder diagrams in $W$
ameliorates systematic errors for insulators in the QS$GW$ approximation. For
benchmarking we consider about 40 well understood semiconductors, and also
examine a variety of less well characterized nonmagnetic systems, six
antiferromagnetic oxides, and the ferrimagnet Fe$_3$O$_4$. We find ladders
ameliorate shortcomings in QS$GW$ to a remarkable degree in both the one-body
Green's function and the dielectric function for a wide range of insulators.
New discrepancies with experiment appear, and a key aim of this paper is to
establish to what extent the errors are systematic and can be traced to
diagrams missing from the theory. One key finding of this work is to establish
a relation between the bandgap and the dielectric constant $\epsilon_{\infty}$.
Good description of both properties together provides a much more robust

environment in the microwave chamber (atmospheric air and air saturated with
water vapor) on the structural changes occurring in the particles was traced.
During the first 10 minutes, capillary water is completely removed and
agglomeration is carried out by attaching single dispersed particles (diffusion
limited aggregation model). At the second stage (10-20 minutes), already formed
agglomerates (cluster-cluster aggregation model) are growing. A complex of
independent optical-physical methods was used to analyze weak structural
changes. It includes X-ray phase analysis, colorimetry and wavelet analysis.
This approach has made it possible to increase the information content and
reliability of measurements, quantitatively characterize the structural
responses in disperse clay systems. In the air, the removal of capillary water
is accompanied by agglomerations of particles and polymorphic transformations
of oxides: montmorillonite is completely decomposed, amorphous phases
crystallize. The composition of the environment in the microwave chamber
affects the type of phase transformations in iron compounds: iron-alumina is
formed in air, magnetite appear in the water vapor medium. The studies carried
out using the developed set of experimental methods indicate the possibility of
regulating the processes of structure formation in disperse clay systems by
optimizing the regimes of exposure to microwave radiation.

young stars that are amenable to detailed astrometric and spectroscopic studies
is critical for the continued development and validation of theories of their
evolution and atmospheric processes. The recent release of the {\it Gaia}
astrometric catalogue allows us to efficiently search for these elusive
companions by targeting those stars that exhibit the astrometric reflex motion
induced by an orbiting companion. The nearby (27 pc), young (24 Myr) star AF
Leporis (AF Lep) was targeted because of its astrometric acceleration,
consistent with a wide-orbit planetary companion detectable with high-contrast
imaging.
  We used the SPHERE instrument on the VLT to search for faint substellar
companions in the immediate vicinity of AF Lep. We used observations of a
nearby star interleaved with those of AF Lep to efficiently subtract the
residual point spread function. This provided sensitivity to faint
planetary-mass companions within 1 arcsec ($\sim$30 au) of the star. We
detected the companion AF Lep b at a separation of 339 mas (9 au), within the
inner edge of its unresolved debris disk. The measured $K$-band contrast and
the age of the star yield a model-dependent mass of 4 and 6 $M_{\rm Jup}$,
consistent with the mass derived from an orbital fit of $4.3_{-1.2}^{+2.9}$
$M_{\rm Jup}$. The near-infrared SED of the planet is consistent with an object
at the L--T spectral type transition, but under-luminous with respect to
field-gravity objects.
  AF Lep b joins a growing number of substellar companions imaged around stars
in the young $\beta$ Pic moving group. With a mass of between 3 and 7 $M_{\rm
Jup}$, it occupies a gap in this isochronal sequence between the hotter, more
massive companions like PZ~Tel~B and $\beta$~Pic~b, and the cooler 51~Eri~b,
which is sufficiently cool for methane to form within its photosphere.

decision making. R Recently, the fairness issue of recommendation has become
more and more essential. A recommender system is considered unfair when it does
not perform equally well for different user groups according to users'
sensitive attributes~(e.g., gender, race). Plenty of methods have been proposed
to alleviate unfairness by optimizing a predefined fairness goal or changing
the distribution of unbalanced training data. However, they either suffered
from the specific fairness optimization metrics or relied on redesigning the
current recommendation architecture. In this paper, we study how to improve
recommendation fairness from the data augmentation perspective. The
recommendation model amplifies the inherent unfairness of imbalanced training
data. We augment imbalanced training data towards balanced data distribution to
improve fairness. The proposed framework is generally applicable to any
embedding-based recommendation, and does not need to pre-define a fairness
metric. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets clearly demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed framework. We publish the source code at

vital for anticipating their bioeffects in the clinical practice. Past studies
using sophisticated acoustic and optical techniques have made enormous progress
in this direction, enabling the development of shell models that adequately
reproduce the nonlinear behaviour of the coated microbubble under acoustic
excitation. However, there have also been puzzling discrepancies and missing
physical explanations for the dependency of shell viscosity on the equilibrium
bubble radius, which demands further experimental investigations. In this
study, we aim to unravel the cause of such behaviour by performing a refined
characterisation of the shell viscosity. We use ultra-high-speed microscopy
imaging, optical trapping and wide-field fluorescence to accurately record the
individual microbubble response upon ultrasound driving across a range of
bubble sizes. An advanced model of bubble dynamics is validated and employed to
infer the shell viscosity of single bubbles from their radial time evolution.
The resulting values reveal a prominent variability of the shell viscosity of
about an order of magnitude and no dependency on the bubble size, which is
contrary to previous studies. We find that the method called bubble
spectroscopy, which has been used extensively in the past to determine the
shell viscosity, is highly sensitive to methodology inaccuracies, and we
demonstrate through analytical arguments that the previously reported
unphysical trends are an artifact of these biases.

text2shape deep retrieval model is established in order to support text
description-based mechanical part shapes retrieval, where the texts are for
describing the structural features of the target mechanical parts. More
specifically, feature engineering is applied to identify the key structural
features of the target mechanical parts. Based on the identified key structural
features, a training set of 1000 samples was constructed, where each sample
consisted of a paragraph of text description of a group of structural features

Orthogonal experiments were used for modeling turning. Eventually, the highest

challenge the implications of the impossibility theorem in practical settings.
First, we show analytically that, by slightly relaxing the impossibility
theorem (to accommodate a \textit{practitioner's} perspective of fairness), it
becomes possible to identify a large set of models that satisfy seemingly
incompatible fairness constraints. Second, we demonstrate the existence of
these models through extensive experiments on five real-world datasets. We
conclude by offering tools and guidance for practitioners to understand when --

example, if one allows only a small margin-of-error between metrics, there
exists a large set of models simultaneously satisfying \emph{False Negative

extracting and reasoning about image region relations based on a Local encoder.
VITR comprises two main components: (1) extending the capabilities of ViT-based
cross-modal networks to extract and reason with region relations in images; and
(2) aggregating the reasoned results with the global knowledge to predict the
similarity scores between images and descriptions. Experiments were carried out
by applying the proposed network to relation-focused cross-modal information
retrieval tasks on the Flickr30K, RefCOCOg, and CLEVR datasets. The results
revealed that the proposed VITR network outperformed various other
state-of-the-art networks including CLIP, VSE$\infty$, and VSRN++ on both
image-to-text and text-to-image cross-modal information retrieval tasks.

becoming increasingly sophisticated software libraries. Most of the solvers
were initially designed with inputs from combinatorics in mind (nauty, bliss,
Traces, dejavu). They excel at dealing with a complicated core of the input.
Others focus on practical instances that exhibit sparsity. They excel at
dealing with comparatively easy but extremely large substructures of the input
(saucy). In practice, these differences manifest in significantly diverging
performances on different types of graph classes.
  We engineer a preprocessor for symmetry detection. The result is a tool
designed to shrink sparse, large substructures of the input graph. On most of
the practical instances, the overall running time improves significantly for
many of the state-of-the-art solvers. At the same time, our benchmarks show
that the additional overhead is negligible.
  Overall we obtain single algorithms with competitive performance across all
benchmark graphs. As such the preprocessor bridges the disparity between
solvers that focus on combinatorial graphs and large practical graphs. In fact,
on most of the practical instances the combined setup significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art.

diagnosed patients surviving for only one year and 6% of them for five.
Computed tomography (CT) screening trials have played a key role in improving
early detection of pancreatic cancer, which has shown significant improvement
in patient survival rates. However, advanced analysis of such images often
requires manual segmentation of the pancreas, which is a time-consuming task.
Moreover, pancreas presents high variability in shape, while occupying only a
very small area of the entire abdominal CT scans, which increases the
complexity of the problem. The rapid development of deep learning can
contribute to offering robust algorithms that provide inexpensive, accurate,
and user-independent segmentation results that can guide the domain experts.
This dissertation addresses this task by investigating a two-step approach for
pancreas segmentation, by assisting the task with a prior rough localization or
detection of pancreas. This rough localization of the pancreas is provided by
an estimated probability map and the detection task is achieved by using the
YOLOv4 deep learning algorithm. The segmentation task is tackled by a modified
U-Net model applied on cropped data, as well as by using a morphological active
contours algorithm. For comparison, the U-Net model was also applied on the
full CT images, which provide a coarse pancreas segmentation to serve as
reference. Experimental results of the detection network on the National

learning. While the problem has been tackled empirically as well as
theoretically, existing methods have several drawbacks. On the one hand,
empirical tools are computationally heavy and lack theoretical foundation. On
the other hand, theoretical approaches do not apply to graphs with
heterogeneous degree distributions, which is often the case for complex
real-world networks. To address these drawbacks, we consider geometric
inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs) as a random graph model, which captures a
variety of properties observed in practice. These include a heterogeneous
degree distribution and non-vanishing clustering coefficient, which is the
probability that two random neighbours of a vertex are adjacent. In GIRGs, $n$
vertices are distributed on a $d$-dimensional torus and weights are assigned to
the vertices according to a power-law distribution. Two vertices are then
connected with a probability that depends on their distance and their weights.
  Our first result shows that the clustering coefficient of GIRGs scales
inverse exponentially with respect to the number of dimensions, when the latter
is at most logarithmic in $n$. This gives a first theoretical explanation for
the low dimensionality of real-world networks observed by Almagro et. al.
[Nature '22]. Our second result is a linear-time algorithm for determining the
dimensionality of a given GIRG. We prove that our algorithm returns the correct
number of dimensions with high probability when the input is a GIRG. As a
result, our algorithm bridges the gap between theory and practice, as it not
only comes with a rigorous proof of correctness but also yields results
comparable to that of prior empirical approaches, as indicated by our

action of a person based on previous hand movements and interactions with the

inherent data security and privacy risks. Since computation time is expensive,
performance is a critical factor for machine learning. However, prevailing
security measures proposed in the past years come with a significant

significantly reduces performance requirements and scales better than previous
approaches. In addition, we introduce the concept of LabelTensors. This allows
us to efficiently use GPUs while using garbled circuits, which further reduces
the runtime. Dash offers security against a malicious attacker and is up to 140
times faster than previous arithmetic garbling schemes.

applications in different fields of computer science, such as crawling and

the application effects dependent on the behavior of cover time: the smaller
the cover time, the better the application performance. It was proved that over
all graphs with $N$ nodes, complete graphs have the minimum cover time $N\log
N$. However, complete graphs cannot mimic real-world networks with small
average degree and scale-free small-world properties, for which the cover time
has not been examined carefully, and its behavior is still not well understood.
In this paper, we first experimentally evaluate the cover time for various
real-world networks with scale-free small-world properties, which scales as
$N\log N$. To better understand the behavior of the cover time for real-world
networks, we then study the cover time of three scale-free small-world model
networks by using the connection between cover time and resistance diameter.
For all the three networks, their cover time also behaves as $N\log N$. This
work indicates that sparse networks with scale-free and small-world topology
are favorable architectures with optimal scaling of cover time. Our results
deepen understanding the behavior of cover time in real-world networks with

and reduction of the number of epidermal nerve fibers per epidermal surface.
Additionally, as neuropathy related nerve fiber loss and regrowth progresses
over time, the two-dimensional spatial arrangement of the nerves becomes more
clustered. These observations suggest that with development of neuropathy, the
spatial pattern of diminished skin innervation is defined by a thinning process
which remains incompletely characterized. We regard samples obtained from
healthy controls and subjects suffering from diabetic neuropathy as
realisations of planar point processes consisting of nerve entry points and
nerve endings, and propose point process models based on spatial thinning to
describe the change as neuropathy advances. Initially, the hypothesis that the
nerve removal occurs completely at random is tested using independent random
thinning of healthy patterns. Then, a dependent parametric thinning model that
favors the removal of isolated nerve trees is proposed. Approximate Bayesian
computation is used to infer the distribution of the model parameters, and the
goodness-of-fit of the models is evaluated using both non-spatial and spatial
summary statistics. Our findings suggest that the nerve mortality process

However, linear solutions are possible for the case where the controlled gate

solidification from a homogeneous shear-melt is a substitutional alloy of body
centred cubic structure. In strictly gas-tight vials, the polycrystalline solid
is stable against melting and further phase transformation for extended times.
For comparison, we prepare the same samples also by slow and mechanically
undisturbed deionization in commercial slit cells. These cells feature a
complex but well reproducible sequence of global and local gradients in salt
concentration, number density and composition as induced by successive
deionization, phoretic transport and differential settling of the components,
respectively. Moreover, they provide an extended bottom surface suitable for
heterogeneous nucleation of the beta-phase. We give a detailed qualitative
characterization of the crystallization processes using imaging and optical
microscopy. By contrast to the bulk samples, the initial alloy formation in
slit cells is not volume-filling, and we now observe also alpha- and
beta-phases with low solubility of the odd component. In addition to the
initial homogeneous nucleation route, the interplay of gradients opens various
further crystallization and transformation pathways leading to a great
diversity of microstructures. Upon subsequent increase in salt concentration,
crystals melt again. Wall-based, pebble-shaped beta-phase crystals and facetted
alpha-crystals melt last. Our observations suggest that the substitutional

Finally, we investigated a four unit cells slab at larger electric fields and

well-posed problems and energy stable discretizations from stationary domains
to the general case including arbitrary mesh motion. In particular, we show
that an energy estimate derived in the physical coordinate system is equivalent
to a semi-bounded property with respect to a stationary reference domain. The
continuous analysis leading up to this result is based on a skew-symmetric
splitting of the material time derivative, and thus relies on the property of
integration-by-parts. Following this, a mimetic energy stable arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian framework for semi-discretization is formulated, based on
approximating the material time derivative in a way consistent with discrete
summation-by-parts. Thanks to the semi-bounded property, a method-of-lines
approach using standard explicit or implicit time integration schemes can be
applied to march the system forward in time. The same type of stability
arguments applies as for the corresponding stationary domain problem, without
regards to additional properties such as discrete geometric conservation. As an
additional bonus we demonstrate that discrete geometric conservation, in the
sense of exact free-stream preservation, can still be achieved in an automatic
way with the new framework. However, we stress that this is not necessary for

filter and browse through. The order in which the products are listed depends
on the ranking algorithm employed in the online shop. State-of-the-art ranking
methods are complex and draw on many different information, e.g., user query
and intent, product attributes, popularity, recency, reviews, or purchases.
However, approaches that incorporate user-generated data such as click-through
data, user ratings, or reviews disadvantage new products that have not yet been
rated by customers. We therefore propose the User-Needs-Driven Ranking (UNDR)
method that accounts for explicit customer needs by using facet popularity and
facet value popularity. As a user-centered approach that does not rely on
post-purchase ratings or reviews, our method bypasses the cold-start problem
while still reflecting the needs of an average customer. In two preliminary
user studies, we compare our ranking method with a rating-based ranking
baseline. Our findings show that our proposed approach generates a ranking that
fits current customer needs significantly better than the baseline. However, a
more fine-grained usage-specific ranking did not further improve the ranking.

random noise with $1/\sqrt{\nu}$ frequency dependence attributed to thermal
noise from internal damping occurring in the grounding wires. From information
available and the physics of internal damping we calculate the differential
acceleration noise spectral density at the signal frequency, and show it varies
widely between experiment sessions. Such large variations are inexplicable if
translated into physical quantities such as the quality factor. While
calibrations interspersed with measurement sessions may cause some such
changes, they cannot explain jumps between consecutive sessions without
recalibration. A potential explanation is conjectured related to a fluctuating
zero depending on measurement initialization errors. The experiment was
severely affected by ""glitches"" -- anomalous acceleration spikes related to
radiation from the Earth -- injecting significant power at the signal frequency
and its harmonics. The procedure used to deal with the glitches depends on
introducing artificial data and leaves spurious effects potentially mimicking a

only on real measured data, is proposed, already used in ground tests of the

minimizing a class of high-dimensional non-convex functions, where a
directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) is proposed to define the nonlocal
gradient (also referred to as the DGS gradient). The method was first proposed
in [42], in which multiple numerical experiments showed that replacing the
traditional local gradient with the DGS gradient can help the optimizers escape
local minima more easily and significantly improve their performance. However,
a rigorous theory for the efficiency of the method on nonconvex landscape is
lacking. In this work, we investigate the scenario where the objective function
is composed of a convex function, perturbed by a oscillating noise. We provide
a convergence theory under which the iterates exponentially converge to a
tightened neighborhood of the solution, whose size is characterized by the
noise wavelength. We also establish a correlation between the optimal values of
the Gaussian smoothing radius and the noise wavelength, thus justify the
advantage of using moderate or large smoothing radius with the method.
Furthermore, if the noise level decays to zero when approaching global minimum,
we prove that DGS-based optimization converges to the exact global minimum with
linear rates, similarly to standard gradient-based method in optimizing convex
functions. Several numerical experiments are provided to confirm our theory and
illustrate the superiority of the approach over those based on the local
gradient.

calculations combined with the KSRF relations provide us with the same ratio
for the range $2 \leq N_f \leq 10$. Assuming a monotonous dependence on $N_f$

modeling with spectral proper orthogonal decomposition. In this method,
space-only proper orthogonal decomposition is first performed on velocity data
to identify a subspace onto which the known equations of motion are projected,
following standard Galerkin projection techniques. The resulting reduced-order
model is then utilized to generate time-resolved trajectories of data. Spectral
proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) is then applied to this model-generated
data to obtain a prediction of the spectral content of the system, while
predicted SPOD modes can be obtained by lifting back to the original velocity
field domain. This method is first demonstrated on a forced, randomly generated
linear system, before being applied to study and reconstruct the spectral
content of two-dimensional flow over two collinear flat plates perpendicular to
an oncoming flow. At the range of Reynolds numbers considered, this
configuration features an unsteady wake characterized by the formation and
interaction of vortical structures in the wake. Depending on the Reynolds
number, the wake can be periodic or feature broadband behavior, making it an
insightful test case to assess the performance of the proposed method. In
particular, we show that this method can accurately recover the spectral
content of periodic, quasi-periodic, and broadband flows without utilizing any

resolution is not required, we show that the predictive accuracy of the

  Detection",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph-level anomaly detection aims to identify anomalous graphs from a
collection of graphs in an unsupervised manner. A common assumption of anomaly
detection is that a reasonable decision boundary has a hypersphere shape, but
may appear some non-conforming phenomena in high dimensions. Towards this end,
we firstly propose a novel deep graph-level anomaly detection model, which
learns the graph representation with maximum mutual information between
substructure and global structure features while exploring a hypersphere
anomaly decision boundary. The idea is to ensure the training data distribution
consistent with the decision hypersphere via an orthogonal projection layer.
Moreover, we further perform the bi-hypersphere compression to emphasize the
discrimination of anomalous graphs from normal graphs. Note that our method is
not confined to graph data and is applicable to anomaly detection of other data
such as images. The numerical and visualization results on benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods in comparison to
many baselines and state-of-the-arts.

manipulation, however, ambidextrous robot picking is still an important and

the fusion of prehensile action and nonprehensile action (push) can expand the

of prehensile action and nonprehensile aciton. The prehensile branch of PGS
takes point clouds as input, and the 6-DoF picking configuration of grasp and
suction in cluttered scenes are generated by multi-task point cloud learning.
The nonprehensile branch with depth image input generates instance segmentation
map and push configuration, cooperating with the prehensile actions to complete
the picking of objects out of single-arm space. PGS generalizes well in real

  Fusion Approach for Indoor Scene Classification","This preprint was submitted at Pattern Recognition Letters",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Indoor scene classification has become an important task in perception
modules and has been widely used in various applications. However, problems
such as intra-category variability and inter-category similarity have been
holding back the models' performance, which leads to the need for new types of
features to obtain a more meaningful scene representation. A semantic
segmentation mask provides pixel-level information about the objects available
in the scene, which makes it a promising source of information to obtain a more
meaningful local representation of the scene. Therefore, in this work, a novel
approach that uses a semantic segmentation mask to obtain a 2D spatial layout
of the object categories across the scene, designated by segmentation-based
semantic features (SSFs), is proposed. These features represent, per object
category, the pixel count, as well as the 2D average position and respective
standard deviation values. Moreover, a two-branch network, GS2F2App, that
exploits CNN-based global features extracted from RGB images and the
segmentation-based features extracted from the proposed SSFs, is also proposed.
GS2F2App was evaluated in two indoor scene benchmark datasets: the SUN RGB-D
and the NYU Depth V2, achieving state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

to solve this learning problem accurately and efficiently. First, since the

complexity of their decision problems when the alphabet is unary.
  (1) This paper improves the upper bound of the equality problem of unary
nondeterministic automata from an exponential in the second root to an
exponential in the third root of the number of states. This almost matches a
known lower bound based on the exponential time hypothesis by Fernau and Krebs.
  (2) It is established that the standard regular operations of union,
intersection, complementation and Kleene star cause either only a polynomial or
a quasipolynomial blow-up. Concatenation of two $n$-state ufas, in worst case,
causes a blow-up from $n$ to a function with an exponent of sixth root of $n$.
Decision problems of finite formulas using regular operations and comparing
languages given by $n$-state unambiguous automata, in worst case, require an
exponential-type of time under the Exponential Time hypothesis and this
complexity goes down to quasipolynomial time in the case that the concatenation
of languages is not used in the formula. Merely comparing two languages given
by $n$-state ufas in Chrobak Normal Form is in LOGSPACE.
  (3) Starting from this research, membership of the infinite word given by a
unary alphabet language in a fixed regular language of infinite words is shown
to be as difficult as constructing the dfa of that language from the given

associated with using soft robots in surgical applications is reconstructing
their shape and the external force exerted on them. Several sensor-based and
model-based approaches have been proposed to address the issue. In this paper,
a shape sensing technique based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is
proposed. The performance of this sensing technique in predicting the tip
position and contact force of a soft bending actuator is highlighted by
conducting a series of empirical tests. The predictions were performed based on
a data-driven approach using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural
network. The tip position predictions indicate the importance of using EIT data
along with pressure inputs. Changing the number of EIT channels, we evaluated
the effect of the number of EIT inputs on the accuracy of the predictions. The
least RMSE values for the tip position are 3.6 and 4.6 mm in Y and Z
coordinates, respectively, which are 7.36% and 6.07% of the actuator's total
range of motion. Contact force predictions were conducted in three different
bending angles and by varying the number of EIT channels. The results of the
predictions illustrated that increasing the number of channels contributes to
higher accuracy of the force estimation. The mean errors of using 8 channels
are 7.69%, 2.13%, and 2.96% of the total force range in three different bending
angles.

continued scaling of the transistor defined by Moore's Law continues, albeit at
a slower pace. Meanwhile, computing demands and energy consumption required by
modern artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have skyrocketed. As an
alternative to scaling transistors for general-purpose computing, the
integration of transistors with unconventional technologies has emerged as a
promising path for domain-specific computing. In this article, we provide a
full-stack review of probabilistic computing with p-bits as a representative
example of the energy-efficient and domain-specific computing movement. We
argue that p-bits could be used to build energy-efficient probabilistic
systems, tailored for probabilistic algorithms and applications. From hardware,
architecture, and algorithmic perspectives, we outline the main applications of
probabilistic computers ranging from probabilistic machine learning and AI to
combinatorial optimization and quantum simulation. Combining emerging
nanodevices with the existing CMOS ecosystem will lead to probabilistic
computers with orders of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency and
probabilistic sampling, potentially unlocking previously unexplored regimes for
powerful probabilistic algorithms.

so-called quarks and leptons, and the forces that act on them. The building
blocks can bundle into larger and heavier particles. These composite particles
are called hadrons. One of the best-known hadrons is the proton. The Higgs
boson, which was first detected in 2012, explains how the smallest building
blocks get their mass. However, the Higgs mechanism only explains 1% of the
mass of the proton. The other 99% arises from internal strong forces that are
not yet well-understood. To better understand the 99%, it is important to study
the production of hadrons in different processes, and to obtain information
from as many different decay reactions as possible. Hadrons of the charmonia
group, such as J/psi and the ground state eta_c, are highly suitable particles
for this, and result in a relatively easy-to-interpret spectrum of narrow peaks
that do not overlap. In this thesis the radiative decay of J/psi into a proton
(p) and antiproton (pbar) is studied. The aim of this study was to gain a
better understanding of the full spectrum of the proton-antiproton invariant
mass, and especially to gain more insight into the poorly-understood properties
of the intermediate resonance eta_c. In this study, a special multidimensional
analysis, a so-called partial-wave analysis, was applied for the first time to
the radiative decay from J/psi to eta_c. This study is based on data taken by
the Beijing Spectrometer (BES) III, which has collected world's largest dataset
of J/psi reactions.

recently introduced as an alternative way of resumming the lattice QCD Taylor

Equation of State (QEOS) and related observables at finite temperature and
density. Unfortunately, the usual formula for exponential resummation of the
lattice data suffers from stochastic bias due to the fact that the derivatives
of the fermion matrix are calculated stochastically. It is necessary to
subtract this bias in order to identify genuine higher-order contributions. In
this paper we present an alternative method of subtracting the stochastic bias
up to a certain order of either the Taylor series or the cumulant expansion by
modifying the argument of the exponential. In this way, the exponential form of
the resummation, and hence the knowledge of the phase factor is retained. We
provide results for the excess pressure, number density and the average phase

better convergent compared to the usual exponential resummation of the QCD

networks (FFNs) which can be viewed as key-value memories according to previous
works. However, FFN and traditional memory utilize different activation
functions (i.e., ReLU and Softmax respectively), which makes them not
equivalent. In this paper, we first rebuild the connections between FFN and
key-value memory by conducting extensive studies on ReLU and Softmax, and find
they are equivalent when adding an additional layer normalization module on
Softmax. In addition, ReLU outperforms Softmax on both FFN and key-value memory
when the number of value slots is large. We analyze the reasons and then
explore this good property of ReLU on the self-attention network where the
original Softmax activation performs poorly on long input sequences. We then
propose a full ReLU architecture named ReLUFormer which performs better than
the baseline Transformer on long sequence tasks such as document translation.
This paper sheds light on the following points: 1) Softmax and ReLU use
different normalization methods over elements which lead to different variances
of results, and ReLU is good at dealing with a large number of key-value slots;
2) FFN and key-value memory are equivalent, and thus the Transformer can be
viewed as a memory network where FFNs and self-attention networks are both
key-value memories.

a constitutive relation between the electric potential Laplacian and the

provides information about the dynamics of axonal degeneration in Multiple
Sclerosis (MS). Current research in the field is focused on the quest for the
most discriminative features among patients and controls and the development of
machine learning models that yield computer-aided solutions widely usable in
clinical practice. However, most studies are conducted with small samples and
the models are used as black boxes. Clinicians should not trust machine
learning decisions unless they come with comprehensive and easily
understandable explanations. Materials and methods: A total of 216 eyes from
111 healthy controls and 100 eyes from 59 patients with relapsing-remitting MS
were enrolled. The feature set was obtained from the thickness of the ganglion
cell layer (GCL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). Measurements were
acquired by the novel Posterior Pole protocol from Spectralis Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT) device. We compared two black-box methods (gradient boosting
and random forests) with a glass-box method (explainable boosting machine).
Explainability was studied using SHAP for the black-box methods and the scores
of the glass-box method. Results: The best-performing models were obtained for
the GCL layer. Explainability pointed out to the temporal location of the GCL
layer that is usually broken or thinning in MS and the relationship between low
thickness values and high probability of MS, which is coherent with clinical
knowledge. Conclusions: The insights on how to use explainability shown in this
work represent a first important step toward a trustworthy computer-aided
solution for the diagnosis of MS with OCT.

spacecraft flies close to the shock, the structure of the plume could be
resolvable using the neutral mass spectrometer on JUICE, allowing us to test

plumes. As the altitude of the shock is uncertain and dependent on

in this area due to the lack of sizable sets of context queries that could
simulate real-world situations, scenarios, and scenes. Commercially collected
context query logs are not publicly accessible and deploying IoT devices, and
context consumers in the real-world at scale is expensive and consumes a
significant effort and time. Therefore, there is a need to develop a method to
reliably generate and simulate context query loads that resembles real-world

nonlinear and time-dependent. The solution is the salt mass fraction, which is
uncertain and changes in time. Uncertainties in porosity, permeability,

investigates the applicability of the well-known multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)

abundant coexisting attractors and moves rectilinearly under periodic

the control of coexisting attractors in this system by using a delayed feedback
controller (DFC) with a constant delay. The aim of our control is to steer this
complex system toward an attractor with preferable performance characteristics
among multiple coexisting attractors, e.g., a periodically fast forward
progression. For this purpose, we give an example of a feedback-controlled
transition from a period-3 motion with low progression speed to a period-1
motion with high progression speed at the system parameters where both
responses coexist. The effectiveness of this controller is investigated
numerically by considering its convergence time and the required control energy
input to achieve transition. We combine pseudo-spectral approximation of the
delay, event detection for the discontinuities and path-following
(continuation) techniques for non-smooth delay dynamical systems to carry out
bifurcation analysis. We systematically study the dynamical performance of the
controlled system when varying its control gain and delay time. Our numerical
simulations show the effectiveness of DFC under a wide range of system
parameters. We find that the desired period-1 motion is achievable in a range
of control delays between a period-doubling and a grazing bifurcation.
Therefore, two-parameter continuation of these two bifurcations with respect to
the control delay and control gain is conducted to identify the delay-gain
parameter region where the period-1 motion is stable. The findings of this work
can be used for tuning control parameters in experiments, and similar analysis
can be carried out for other non-smooth dynamical systems with a constant delay

to subtle differences among subordinate categories. Many current FGVC
approaches focus on identifying and locating discriminative regions by using

hinder the understanding of object structure. These unnecessary features,
including 1) ambiguous parts resulting from the visual similarity in object
appearances and 2) noninformative parts (e.g., background noise), can have a
significant adverse impact on classification results. In this paper, we propose
the Semantic Feature Integration network (SFI-Net) to address the above
difficulties. By eliminating unnecessary features and reconstructing the
semantic relations among discriminative features, our SFI-Net has achieved
satisfying performance. The network consists of two modules: 1) the multi-level

different receptive field, and then concatenate the preserved features on pixel
level for subsequent disposal; 2) the semantic information reconstitution (SIR)
module is presented to further establish semantic relations among

image-text understanding. Yet, it is an open question to what extent they can
be used for language understanding in 3D environments and whether they
implicitly acquire 3D object knowledge, e.g. about different views of an
object. In this paper, we investigate whether a state-of-the-art language and
vision model, CLIP, is able to ground perspective descriptions of a 3D object
and identify canonical views of common objects based on text queries. We
present an evaluation framework that uses a circling camera around a 3D object
to generate images from different viewpoints and evaluate them in terms of
their similarity to natural language descriptions. We find that a pre-trained
CLIP model performs poorly on most canonical views and that fine-tuning using
hard negative sampling and random contrasting yields good results even under
conditions with little available training data.

DONNs system for scientific computing, including guiding two-dimensional
quantum material synthesis, predicting the properties of nanomaterials and
small molecular cancer drugs, predicting the device response of nanopatterned

applied in different disciplines because of its origin from first principles,
its concise form, and its computational efficiency. So far the algorithm for
its estimation is based on differential dynamical systems, which, however, may
make an issue for coarsely sampled time series. Here, we show that for linear
systems, this is fine at least qualitatively; but for highly nonlinear systems,
the bias increases significantly as the sampling frequency is reduced. This
paper provides a partial solution to this problem, showing how causality
analysis is assured faithful with coarsely sampled series when, of course, the
statistics is sufficient. An explicit and concise formula has been obtained,
with only sample covariances involved. It has been successfully applied to a
system comprising of a pair of coupled R\""ossler oscillators. Particularly
remarkable is the success when the two oscillators are nearly synchronized.

probability requires knowledge of statistical dependence of all orders among
the minimal cut sets. Since dependence among the cut sets beyond the second
order is generally difficult to obtain, second order bounds on system failure
probability have practical value. The upper bound is conservative by definition
and can be adopted in reliability based decision making. In this paper we
propose a new hierarchy of m-level second order upper bounds, Bm : the
well-known Kounias-Vanmarcke-Hunter-Ditlevsen (KVHD) bound - the current
standard for upper bounds using second order joint probabilities - turns out to
be the weakest member of this family (m = 1). We prove that Bm is
non-increasing with level m in every ordering of the cut sets, and derive
conditions under which Bm+1 is strictly less than Bm for any m and any
ordering. We also derive conditions under which the optimal level m bound is
strictly less than the optimal level m + 1 bound, and show that this
improvement asymptotically achieves a probability of 1 as long as the second
order joint probabilities are only constrained by the pair of corresponding
first order probabilities. Numerical examples show that our second order upper
bounds can yield tighter values than previously achieved and in every case
exhibit considerable less scatter across the entire n! orderings of the cut
sets compared to KVHD bounds. Our results therefore may lead to more efficient
identification of the optimal upper bound when coupled with existing linear
programming and tree search based approaches.

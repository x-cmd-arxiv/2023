absorption systems recently uncovered through strong H2 absorption at small
velocity separation from the background quasars. We performed a
multi-wavelength spectroscopic follow-up of thirteen such systems with
VLT/X-Shooter. Here, we present the observations and study the overall chemical
enrichment measured from the HI, H2 and metal lines. We combine this with an
investigation of the neutral gas kinematics with respect to the quasar host. We
find gas-phase metallicities in the range 2% to 40% of the Solar value, i.e. in
the upper-half range of HI-selected proximate damped Lyman-alpha systems, but
similar to what is seen in intervening H2-bearing systems. This is likely
driven by similar selection effects that play against the detection of most
metal and molecular rich systems in absorption. Differences are however seen in
the abundance of dust (from [Zn/Fe]) and its depletion pattern, when compared
to intervening systems, possibly indicating different dust production or
destruction close to the AGN. We also note the almost-ubiquitous presence of a
high-ionisation phase traced by NV in proximate systems. In spite of the hard
UV field from the quasars, we found no strong overall deficit of neutral argon,
at least when compared to intervening DLAs. This likely results from argon
being mostly neutral in the H2 phase, which actually accounts for a large
fraction of the total amount of metals. We measure the quasar systemic
redshifts through emission lines from both ionised gas and CO(3-2) emission,
the latter being detected in all 6 cases for which we obtained 3-mm data from
complementary NOEMA observations. For the first time, we observe a trend
between line-of-sight velocity with respect to systemic redshift and
metallicity of the absorbing gas. [truncated]

research topic in network analysis. While initially the focus has been mostly
on efficiency, recently fairness criteria have been taken into account in this
setting. Most work has focused on the maximin criteria however, and thus still
different groups can receive very different shares of information. In this work
we propose to consider fairness as a notion to be guaranteed by an algorithm
rather than as a criterion to be maximized. To this end, we propose three
optimization problems that aim at maximizing the overall spread while enforcing
strict levels of demographic parity fairness via constraints (either ex-post or
ex-ante). The level of fairness hence becomes a user choice rather than a
property to be observed upon output. We study this setting from various
perspectives. First, we prove that the cost of introducing demographic parity
can be high in terms of both overall spread and computational complexity, i.e.,
the price of fairness may be unbounded for all three problems and optimal
solutions are hard to compute, in some case even approximately or when fairness
constraints may be violated. For one of our problems, we still design an
algorithm with both constant approximation factor and fairness violation. We
also give two heuristics that allow the user to choose the tolerated fairness
violation. By means of an extensive experimental study, we show that our
algorithms perform well in practice, that is, they achieve the best demographic
parity fairness values. For certain instances we additionally even obtain an
overall spread comparable to the most efficient algorithms that come without
any fairness guarantee, indicating that the empirical price of fairness may
actually be small when using our algorithms.

recently. Most works in this context study the question of how to find seeding

been used in this context. All these works assume that the entity that is
spreading the information has an inherent interest in spreading the information
fairly, otherwise why would they want to use the developed fair algorithms?
This assumption may however be flawed in reality -- the spreading entity may be
purely \emph{efficiency-oriented}. In this paper we propose to study two
optimization problems with the goal to modify the network structure by adding
links in such a way that efficiency-oriented information spreading becomes
\emph{automatically fair}. We study the proposed optimization problems both
from a theoretical and experimental perspective, that is, we give several
hardness and hardness of approximation results, provide efficient algorithms
for some special cases, and more importantly provide heuristics for solving one
of the problems in practice. In our experimental study we then first compare
the proposed heuristics against each other and establish the most successful
one. In a second experiment, we then show that our approach can be very
successful in practice. That is, we show that already after adding a few edges
to the networks the greedy algorithm that purely maximizes spread surpasses all
fairness-tailored algorithms in terms of ex-post fairness. Maybe surprisingly,
we even show that our approach achieves ex-post fairness values that are
comparable or even better than the ex-ante fairness values of the currently

of new networking technologies, such as optical circuit switches. These
technologies allow for programmable network topologies that can be reconfigured
to better serve network traffic, thus enabling a trade-off between the benefits
(i.e., shorter routes) and costs of reconfigurations (i.e., overhead).
Self-Adjusting Networks (SANs) aim at addressing this trade-off by exploiting
patterns in network traffic, both when it is revealed piecewise (online dynamic
topologies) or known in advance (offline static topologies). In this paper, we
take the first steps toward Self-Adjusting k-ary tree networks. These are more
powerful generalizations of existing binary search tree networks (like
SplayNets), which have been at the core of SAN designs. k-ary search tree
networks are a natural generalization offering nodes of higher degrees, reduced
route lengths for a fixed number of nodes, and local routing in spite of
reconfigurations. We first compute an offline (optimal) static network for
arbitrary traffic patterns in $O(n^3 \cdot k)$ time via dynamic programming,
and also improve the bound to $O(n^2 \cdot k)$ for the special case of
uniformly distributed traffic. Then, we present a centroid-based topology of
the network that can be used both in the offline static and the online setting.
In the offline uniform-workload case, we construct this quasi-optimal network
in linear time $O(n)$ and, finally, we present online self-adjusting k-ary
search tree versions of SplayNet. We evaluate experimentally our new structure
for $k=2$ (allowing for a comparison with existing SplayNets) on real and
synthetic network traces. Our results show that this approach works better than
SplayNet in most of the real network traces and in average to low locality
synthetic traces, and is only little inferior to SplayNet in all remaining
traces.

knowledge graph (KG) reasoning. Query encoding (QE) is proposed as a fast and
robust solution to CQA. In the encoding process, most existing QE methods first
parse the logical query into an executable computational direct-acyclic graph
(DAG), then use neural networks to parameterize the operators, and finally,
recursively execute these neuralized operators. However, the
parameterization-and-execution paradigm may be potentially over-complicated, as
it can be structurally simplified by a single neural network encoder.
Meanwhile, sequence encoders, like LSTM and Transformer, proved to be effective
for encoding semantic graphs in related tasks. Motivated by this, we propose
sequential query encoding (SQE) as an alternative to encode queries for CQA.
Instead of parameterizing and executing the computational graph, SQE first uses
a search-based algorithm to linearize the computational graph to a sequence of
tokens and then uses a sequence encoder to compute its vector representation.
Then this vector representation is used as a query embedding to retrieve
answers from the embedding space according to similarity scores. Despite its
simplicity, SQE demonstrates state-of-the-art neural query encoding performance
on FB15k, FB15k-237, and NELL on an extended benchmark including twenty-nine
types of in-distribution queries. Further experiment shows that SQE also
demonstrates comparable knowledge inference capability on out-of-distribution

of subsequent maneuvers while bounding the risk of collision with surrounding
dynamic obstacles. These obstacles, such as agent vehicles, often exhibit
stochastic transitions that should be accounted for in a timely and safe
manner. The Constrained Stochastic Shortest Path problem (C-SSP) is a formalism
for planning in stochastic environments under certain types of operating
constraints. While C-SSP allows specifying constraints in the planning problem,
it does not allow for bounding the probability of constraint violation, which
is desired in safety-critical applications. This work's first contribution is
an exact integer linear programming formulation for Chance-constrained SSP
(CC-SSP) that attains deterministic policies. Second, a randomized rounding
procedure is presented for stochastic policies. Third, we show that the CC-SSP
formalism can be generalized to account for constraints that span through
multiple time steps. Evaluation results show the usefulness of our approach in

To tackle this challenge, we explore imitation learning algorithms. These
methods learn a controller by observing demonstrations of an expert, such as
the behaviour of a centralised omniscient controller, which can perceive the
entire environment, including the state and observations of all agents.
  Performing tasks with complete knowledge of the state of a system is
relatively easy, but centralised solutions might not be feasible in real
scenarios since agents do not have direct access to the state but only to their
observations. To overcome this issue, we train end-to-end Neural Networks that
take as input local observations obtained from an omniscient centralised
controller, i.e., the agents' sensor readings and the communications received,
producing as output the action to be performed and the communication to be
transmitted.
  This study concentrates on two cooperative tasks using a distributed
controller: distributing the robots evenly in space and colouring them based on
their position relative to others. While an explicit exchange of messages
between the agents is required to solve the second task, in the first one, a
communication protocol is unnecessary, although it may increase performance.
  The experiments are run in Enki, a high-performance open-source simulator for
planar robots, which provides collision detection and limited physics support
for robots evolving on a flat surface. Moreover, it can simulate groups of
robots hundreds of times faster than real-time.

Furthermore, we study the critical temperature $T_c$, as well as the spectral

Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments at different tip speed ratios ($\lambda$).
The wind turbine model had a nacelle and a tower mimicking real scale wind
turbines. The near wake is found to be dominated by multiple coherent
structures including the tip vortices, distinct vortex sheddings from the
nacelle and tower, and wake meandering. The merging of the tip vortices is
found to be strongly dependent on $\lambda$. A convective length scale ($L_c$)
related to the pitch of the helical vortices is defined which is shown to be a
better length scale than turbine diameter ($D$) to demarcate the near wake from
the far wake. The tower induced strong vertical asymmetry in the flow by
destabilising the tip vortices and promoting mixing in the lower (below the
nacelle) plane. The nacelle's shedding is found to be important in 'seeding'
wake meandering which although not potent, exists close to the nacelle, and it
becomes important only after a certain distance downstream ($x>3L_c$). A link
between the 'effective porosity' of the turbine and $\lambda$ is established
and the strength and frequency of wake meandering is found to be dependent on
$\lambda$. In fact, a decreasing trend of wake meandering frequency with
$\lambda$ is observed, similar to vortex shedding from a porous disk at varying
porosity. Such similarity upholds the notion of wake meandering being a global
instability of the turbine, which can be considered as a 'porous' bluff body of

Batteries are vital to HEVs and significantly impact overall vehicle cost and
performance. High temperature and high battery State of Charge (SOC) are the
main factors that accelerate battery aging. SOC is the most critical state
variable in EMS and was usually considered the only dynamic variable in
previous studies. For simplicity, the battery temperature was often assumed to
be constant, and the effect of EMS on temperature change was neglected. In this
paper, we first apply Dynamic Programming (DP) to a PHEV without considering
battery temperature variations. Then, the battery model is improved by modeling
the cooling system to take into account temperature variations and show how
neglecting the thermal dynamics of the battery in EMS is impractical. Finally,
by integrating battery temperature as a state variable in the optimization
problem, a new EMS is proposed to control battery temperature and SOC
variation. Simulation results of the tested vehicle show that the proposed
method controls battery charge and temperature. The proposed EMS method
prevents uncontrolled fluctuations in battery temperature and reduces its

alternative to classical, purely geometrical formulations. It is challenging to
devise solutions to nonsmooth contact problem with continuous gap using finite
element discretizations. We herein achieve this objective by constructing an
approximate distance function (ADF) to the boundaries of solid objects, and in
doing so, also obtain universal uniqueness of contact detection. Unilateral
constraints are implemented using a mixed model combining the screened Poisson
equation and a force element, which has the topology of a continuum element
containing an additional incident node. An ADF is obtained by solving the
screened Poisson equation with constant essential boundary conditions and a
variable transformation. The ADF does not explicitly depend on the number of
objects and a single solution of the partial differential equation for this
field uniquely defines the contact conditions for all incident points in the
mesh. Having an ADF field to any obstacle circumvents the multiple target
surfaces and avoids the specific data structures present in traditional
contact-impact algorithms. We also relax the interpretation of the Lagrange
multipliers as contact forces, and the Courant--Beltrami function is used with
a mixed formulation producing the required differentiable result. We
demonstrate the advantages of the new approach in two- and three-dimensional
problems that are solved using Newton iterations. Simultaneous constraints for
each incident point are considered.

embedding that separates the data. So far it was only used with $k$-nn graphs,
which are usually constructed using a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean
distance). $k$-nn graphs restrict the points to have a fixed number of
neighbors regardless of the local statistics around them. We proposed a new
SpectralNet similarity metric based on random projection trees (rpTrees). Our
experiments revealed that SpectralNet produces better clustering accuracy using
rpTree similarity metric compared to $k$-nn graph with a distance metric. Also,
we found out that rpTree parameters do not affect the clustering accuracy.
These parameters include the leaf size and the selection of projection
direction. It is computationally efficient to keep the leaf size in order of
$\log(n)$, and project the points onto a random direction instead of trying to
find the direction with the maximum dispersion.

various electroencephalography (EEG) learning tasks by training on large
datasets with ground truth labels. However, labeling EEG data for affective
experiments is challenging, as it can be difficult for participants to
accurately distinguish between similar emotions, resulting in ambiguous
labeling (reporting multiple emotions for one EEG instance). This notion could
cause model performance degradation, as the ground truth is hidden within
multiple candidate labels. To address this issue, Partial Label Learning (PLL)
has been proposed to identify the ground truth from candidate labels during the
training phase, and has shown good performance in the computer vision domain.
However, PLL methods have not yet been adopted for EEG representation learning
or implemented for emotion recognition tasks. In this paper, we adapt and
re-implement six state-of-the-art PLL approaches for emotion recognition from
EEG on a large emotion dataset (SEED-V, containing five emotion classes). We
evaluate the performance of all methods in classical and real-world
experiments. The results show that PLL methods can achieve strong results in
affective computing from EEG and achieve comparable performance to fully
supervised learning. We also investigate the effect of label disambiguation, a
key step in many PLL methods. The results show that in most cases, label
disambiguation would benefit the model when the candidate labels are generated
based on their similarities to the ground truth rather than obeying a uniform
distribution. This finding suggests the potential of using label
disambiguation-based PLL methods for real-world affective tasks. We make the

(AFA-MI) augmentation, which forces the segmentation network to learn
out-of-distribution statistics and improve generalization and robustness to
noises. AFA-MI augmentation consists of three steps: 1) generate adversarial
noises by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on the intermediate features of the
segmentation network's encoder; 2) inject the generated adversarial noises into
the network, intentionally compromising performance; 3) optimize the network
with both clean and adversarial features. Experiments are conducted segmenting
the heart, left and right kidney, liver, left and right lung, spinal cord, and
stomach. We first evaluate the AFA-MI augmentation using nnUnet and TT-Vnet on
the test data from a public abdominal dataset and an institutional dataset. In
addition, we validate how AFA-MI affects the networks' robustness to the noisy
data by evaluating the networks with added Gaussian noises of varying
magnitudes to the institutional dataset. Network performance is quantitatively
evaluated using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) for volume-based accuracy.
Also, Hausdorff Distance (HD) is applied for surface-based accuracy. On the
public dataset, nnUnet with AFA-MI achieves DSC = 0.85 and HD = 6.16
millimeters (mm); and TT-Vnet achieves DSC = 0.86 and HD = 5.62 mm. AFA-MI
augmentation further improves all contour accuracies up to 0.217 DSC score when
tested on images with Gaussian noises. AFA-MI augmentation is therefore
demonstrated to improve segmentation performance and robustness in CT

whose magnetic field reconnects both with itself and also with surrounding
coronal field. There is evidence that minifilament eruptions are a scaled-down
version of typical filament eruptions that produce solar flares and coronal
mass ejections (CMEs). Moreover, the magnetic processes building up to and
triggering minifilament eruptions, which is often flux cancelation, might
similarly build up and trigger the larger filaments to erupt. Thus, detailed
study of coronal jets will inform us of the physics leading to, triggering, and

  Platforms","12 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables",,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-rotor UAVs suffer from a restricted range and flight duration due to
limited battery capacity. Autonomous landing on a 2D moving platform offers the
possibility to replenish batteries and offload data, thus increasing the
utility of the vehicle. Classical approaches rely on accurate, complex and
difficult-to-derive models of the vehicle and the environment. Reinforcement
learning (RL) provides an attractive alternative due to its ability to learn a
suitable control policy exclusively from data during a training procedure.
However, current methods require several hours to train, have limited success
rates and depend on hyperparameters that need to be tuned by trial-and-error.
We address all these issues in this work. First, we decompose the landing
procedure into a sequence of simpler, but similar learning tasks. This is
enabled by applying two instances of the same RL based controller trained for
1D motion for controlling the multi-rotor's movement in both the longitudinal
and the lateral direction. Second, we introduce a powerful state space
discretization technique that is based on i) kinematic modeling of the moving
platform to derive information about the state space topology and ii)
structuring the training as a sequential curriculum using transfer learning.
Third, we leverage the kinematics model of the moving platform to also derive
interpretable hyperparameters for the training process that ensure sufficient
maneuverability of the multi-rotor vehicle. The training is performed using the
tabular RL method Double Q-Learning. Through extensive simulations we show that
the presented method significantly increases the rate of successful landings,
while requiring less training time compared to other deep RL approaches.
Finally, we deploy and demonstrate our algorithm on real hardware. For all
evaluation scenarios we provide statistics on the agent's performance.

Traditional approaches use coordinated views or 3D metaphors like the
Space-time cube to tackle this problem. However, they suffer from overplotting
and often lack spatial context, hindering data exploration. More recent
techniques, such as MotionRugs, propose compact temporal summaries based on 1D

which the spatial extent of the objects and their intersections is relevant,
such as the analysis of surveillance videos or tracking weather storms. In this
paper, we propose MoReVis, a visual overview of spatiotemporal data that
considers the objects' spatial extent and strives to show spatial interactions
among these objects by displaying spatial intersections. Like previous
techniques, our method involves projecting the spatial coordinates to 1D to
produce compact summaries. However, our solution's core consists of performing
a layout optimization step that sets the size and positions of the visual marks
on the summary to resemble the actual values on the original space. We also

cells with a partial wall in between to force the generation of two interacting
convection rolls. Observed stable states include both counter-rotating and
co-rotating states. The stability of each of these states and their dynamics
were modeled by stochastic ordinary differential equations of motion in terms
of the orientation, amplitude, and mean temperature of each convection roll.
The form of the interaction terms is predicted based on an effective turbulent
diffusion of temperature between the adjacent rolls. Predictions are made for
stable fixed points of the co- and counter-rotating states. This suggests that
the same turbulent thermal diffusivity that describes macroscopically averaged
heat transport also controls the interactions between neighboring convection
rolls. The surprising stability of co-rotating states is due to the temperature
difference between the neighboring rolls becoming large enough that the heat
flux between the rolls stabilizes the temperature profile of aligned
co-rotating states. This temperature difference can be driven by heating the
plates of the two cells to different mean temperatures. This shifts the
orientations of the rolls of counter-rotating states in opposite directions,
and for large temperature differences only co-rotating states are stable
Spontaneous switching between co-rotating and counter-rotating states is also
observed. Switching to counter-rotating states occurs mainly due to cessation
(a significant weakening of a convection roll), which reduces damping on
changes in orientation, allowing the orientation to change rapidly due to
diffusive fluctuations. Switching to co-rotating states is mainly driven by
smaller diffusive fluctuations, which have a positive feedback that
destabilizes the counter-rotating state.

diffusion on anatase (101) surface using 72 and 216 atoms surface slabs
employing a semi-local density functional and the Hubbard model. The
activation-relaxation technique nouveau (ARTn) coupled with Quantum Espresso is
used to investigate the activated mechanisms responsible for the diffusion of
oxygen vacancies. The small slab model over-stabilizes the +2 charged topmost
surface vacancy, which is attributed to the strong Coulomb repulsion between
vacancy and neighboring Ti+4 ions. The larger slab allows atoms to relax
parallel to the surface, decreasing the +2 charged topmost surface vacancy
stability. The calculated surface-to-subsurface barriers for the +2 charged
vacancy and diffusion of the neutral vacancy on a slab of 216 atoms are 0.82 eV
and 0.52 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the bulk vacancy prefers to migrate
toward the subsurface with relatively low activation barriers 0.19 eV and 0.27
eV and the reverse process has to overcome 0.38 eV and 0.40 eV barriers for the
+2 charged and the neutral vacancies. This explains the experimentally observed
high concentration of vacancies at the subsurface sites rather than in the
bulk, and the dynamic diffusion of vacancies from the bulk to the subsurface
and from the subsurface to the bulk is highly likely on the surface of anatase
(101). Finally, we provide a plausible explanation for the origin of recently

three dimensional (3D) imaging requires the acquisition of a large number of

Inspired by stereo vision, in this paper, we develop X-ray imaging methods that
work with two X-ray projection images. In this setting, without the use of
additional strong prior information, we no longer have enough information to
fully recover the 3D tomographic images. However, up to a point, we are
nevertheless able to extract spatial locations of point and line features. From
stereo vision, it is well known that, for a known imaging geometry, once the
same point is identified in two images taken from different directions, then
the point's location in 3D space is exactly specified. The challenge is the
matching of points between images. As X-ray transmission images are
fundamentally different from the surface reflection images used in standard
computer vision, we here develop a different feature identification and
matching approach. In fact, once point like features are identified, if there
are limited points in the image, then they can often be matched exactly. In
fact, by utilising a third observation from an appropriate direction, matching
becomes unique. Once matched, point locations in 3D space are easily computed

root of the density matrix, and consequently enjoys several unusual advantages
over standard representations. By combining this with purification techniques
imported from quantum information, we are able to obtain a number of results.
Not only is this formalism able to provide a natural bridge between phase and

this motivation, the Indic- Multilingual Speaker Verification (I-MSV) Challenge
2022 has been designed for understanding and comparing the state-of-the-art SV
techniques. For the challenge, approximately $100$ hours of data spoken by
$100$ speakers has been collected using $5$ different sensors in $13$ Indian
languages. The data is divided into development, training, and testing sets and
has been made publicly available for further research. The goal of this
challenge is to make the SV system robust to language and sensor variations
between enrollment and testing. In the challenge, participants were asked to
develop the SV system in two scenarios, viz. constrained and unconstrained. The
best system in the constrained and unconstrained scenario achieved a
performance of $2.12\%$ and $0.26\%$ in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER),

fundamental task for training large language models such as Transformer, GPT-1,

input three matrices $Q, K, V \in [-B,B]^{n \times d}$, and the goal is to
construct the matrix $\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V) := \mathrm{diag}(A {\bf 1}_n)^{-1} A
V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, where $A = \exp(QK^\top/d)$ is the `attention

problem explicitly compute the $n \times n$ attention matrix $A$, and hence
require time $\Omega(n^2)$ even when $d = n^{o(1)}$ is small.
  In this paper, we investigate whether faster algorithms are possible by
implicitly making use of the matrix $A$. We present two results, showing that
there is a sharp transition at $B = \Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$.
  $\bullet$ If $d = O(\log n)$ and $B = o(\sqrt{\log n})$, there is an
$n^{1+o(1)}$ time algorithm to approximate $\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V)$ up to
$1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ additive error.

Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory, it is
impossible to approximate $\mathrm{Att}(Q,K,V)$ up to $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$
additive error in truly subquadratic time $n^{2 - \Omega(1)}$.
  This gives a theoretical explanation for the phenomenon observed in practice
that attention computation is much more efficient when the input matrices have

Geometric phase concepts - observed in many physical systems - are particularly

scattering rate and phase across the metasurface aperture without affecting the
delocalized nature of the q-BIC resonance. However, this control typically
comes with stringent limitations in terms of efficiency and/or of polarization

along a continuous contour of geometric perturbations that parametrically
encircle a singularity associated with a bound state. This response is obtained
regardless of the chosen polarization state, which can be rationally specified
by a judicious choice of the perturbation geometry. Our findings extend
geometric phase concepts to arbitrary polarizations, including linear and

often fit entire SEMs to data, but this can fail if some model parameters are

more flexible alternative that can estimate subsets of model parameters in

""latent-to-observed"" (L2O) transformation from the MIIV approach and develop an
equivalent graphical L2O transformation that allows applying existing graphical

ice shell and solid interior. This paper explores the spin-orbit coupling
problem for Europa from a dynamical perspective, yielding illuminating
analytical and numerical results. We determine that the spin behavior of Europa
is influenced by processes not captured by the classical single rigid body
spin-orbit coupling analysis. The tidal locking process for Europa is governed
by the strength of gravity-gradient coupling between the ice shell and solid
interior, with qualitatively different behavior depending on the scale of this
effect. In this coupled rigid model, the shell can potentially undergo large
angular displacements from the solid interior, and the coupling plays an
outsize role in the dynamical evolution of the moon, even without incorporating
the dissipative effects of shell non-rigidity. This work extends classical
spin-orbit coupling analysis to the icy ocean worlds, lending a new perspective

elements for robot perception, locomotion, navigation and autonomy. These
included degraded wireless communication, poor visibility due to smoke, narrow
passages and doorways, clutter, uneven ground, slippery and loose terrain,
stairs, ledges, overhangs, dripping water, and dynamic obstacles that move to
block paths among others. In the Final Event of this challenge held in
September 2021, the course consisted of all three subdomains. The task was for
the robot team to perform a scavenger hunt for a number of pre-defined
artefacts within a limited time frame. Only one human supervisor was allowed to
communicate with the robots once they were in the course. Points were scored
when accurate detections and their locations were communicated back to the
scoring server. A total of 8 teams competed in the finals held at the Mega
Cavern in Louisville, KY, USA. This article describes the systems deployed by
Team CSIRO Data61 that tied for the top score and won second place at the
event.

This incompleteness gives birth to the task of cross-lingual question answering
over knowledge base (xKBQA), which aims to answer questions in languages
different from that of the provided KB. One of the major challenges facing
xKBQA is the high cost of data annotation, leading to limited resources
available for further exploration. Another challenge is mapping KB schemas and
natural language expressions in the questions under cross-lingual settings. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach for xKBQA in a reading comprehension
paradigm. We convert KB subgraphs into passages to narrow the gap between KB
schemas and questions, which enables our model to benefit from recent advances
in multilingual pre-trained language models (MPLMs) and cross-lingual machine
reading comprehension (xMRC). Specifically, we use MPLMs, with considerable
knowledge of cross-lingual mappings, for cross-lingual reading comprehension.
Existing high-quality xMRC datasets can be further utilized to finetune our
model, greatly alleviating the data scarcity issue in xKBQA. Extensive
experiments on two xKBQA datasets in 12 languages show that our approach
outperforms various baselines and achieves strong few-shot and zero-shot
performance. Our dataset and code are released for further research.

from different anatomical regions. Due to the mismatches of the scan region and
corresponding scan protocols, there is usually a difference of noise
distributions between source and target domains (a.k.a. noise distribution
shifts), resulting in a catastrophic deterioration of the reconstruction
performance on target domain. To render a robust cross-domain CT reconstruction
performance, instead of using deterministic models (e.g., convolutional neural
network), a Bayesian-endowed probabilistic framework is introduced into robust
cross-domain CT reconstruction task due to its impressive robustness. Under
this probabilistic framework, we propose to alleviate the noise distribution
shifts between source and target domains via implicit noise modeling schemes in

adversarial learning manner is imposed to reduce the discrepancy of noise

Existing work relies on a uniform misspecification parameter $\epsilon$ that
measures the sup-norm error of the best linear approximation. This results in
an unavoidable linear regret whenever $\epsilon > 0$. We describe a more
natural model of misspecification which only requires the approximation error
at each input $x$ to be proportional to the suboptimality gap at $x$. It
captures the intuition that, for optimization problems, near-optimal regions
should matter more and we can tolerate larger approximation errors in
suboptimal regions. Quite surprisingly, we show that the classical LinUCB
algorithm -- designed for the realizable case -- is automatically robust
against such gap-adjusted misspecification. It achieves a near-optimal
$\sqrt{T}$ regret for problems that the best-known regret is almost linear in
time horizon $T$. Technically, our proof relies on a novel self-bounding

it possible to propagate information from long-range neighboring frames and

demonstrate this by introducing a straightforward self-supervised objective

unified formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equations, flavor-dependent
symmetry preserving vector-vector contact interaction model of quarks, and an
optimal time regularization scheme. For fixed $N_c=3$ and $N_f=2$, the
dynamically quark mass decreases as we increase $eE$ and near at and above the
pseudo-critical electric field $eE_c$, the chiral symmetry is restored and
quarks becomes unconfined. The pair production rate $\Gamma$ becomes stable and
grows quickly above $eE_c$. For fixed $N_c=3$ and upon increasing $N_f$ the
dynamical mass suppresses and as a result, the $eE_c$ reduces to its smaller
values, the pair production rate $\Gamma$ tends to initiates and grows quickly
for smaller values of $eE_c$. In contrast, for fixed $N_f=2$ and upon
increasing $N_c$, the dynamical chiral symmetry is restored for larger and
larger values of $eE_c$ and at $N_c\geq4$, the transition changes from smooth
cross-over to the first order at some critical endpoint ($N_{c,p}, eE_{c,p}$).
Consequently, the quark-antiquark production rate $\Gamma$ needs higher values
of $eE_c$ for the stable and quick growth as we increase $N_c$.
  Our findings are satisfactory and in agreement with already predicted results

critical values of the momentum map. Interesting structure arises because the
ellipsoidal coordinate system can degenerate in a variety of ways, and all
possible orthogonally separable coordinate systems on $S^3$ (including
degenerations) have the topology of the Stasheff polytope $K^4$, which is a
pentagon. We describe how the generic integrable system degenerates, and how
the appearance of global $SO(2)$ and $SO(3)$ symmetries is the main feature

for estimating model parameters for non-linear systems of ODEs. Without relying
on any numerical differential equation solvers, WENDy computes accurate
estimates and is robust to large (biologically relevant) levels of measurement
noise. For low dimensional systems with modest amounts of data, WENDy is
competitive with conventional forward solver-based nonlinear least squares
methods in terms of speed and accuracy. For both higher dimensional systems and
stiff systems, WENDy is typically both faster (often by orders of magnitude)
and more accurate than forward solver-based approaches.
  The core mathematical idea involves an efficient conversion of the strong
form representation of a model to its weak form, and then solving a regression
problem to perform parameter inference. The core statistical idea rests on the
Errors-In-Variables framework, which necessitates the use of the iteratively
reweighted least squares algorithm. Further improvements are obtained by using
orthonormal test functions, created from a set of C-infinity bump functions of
varying support sizes.
  We demonstrate the high robustness and computational efficiency by applying
WENDy to estimate parameters in some common models from population biology,
neuroscience, and biochemistry, including logistic growth, Lotka-Volterra,
FitzHugh-Nagumo, Hindmarsh-Rose, and a Protein Transduction Benchmark model.

  Acoustic-to-Articulatory Inversion",,,,,"cs.SD cs.MM eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) aims to estimate the parameters of
articulators from speech audio. There are two common challenges in AAI, which
are the limited data and the unsatisfactory performance in speaker independent
scenario. Most current works focus on extracting features directly from speech
and ignoring the importance of phoneme information which may limit the
performance of AAI. To this end, we propose a novel network called SPN that
uses two different streams to carry out the AAI task. Firstly, to improve the
performance of speaker-independent experiment, we propose a new phoneme stream
network to estimate the articulatory parameters as the phoneme features. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first work that extracts the
speaker-independent features from phonemes to improve the performance of AAI.
Secondly, in order to better represent the speech information, we train a
speech stream network to combine the local features and the global features.
Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA), the proposed method reduces 0.18mm on
RMSE and increases 6.0% on Pearson correlation coefficient in the
speaker-independent experiment. The code has been released at

experience (QoE) and privy to their tastes, preferences, and even the devices

alternative DNS services, from public DNS to encrypted and Oblivious DNS. While
offering valuable features, these DNS variants are operated by a handful of
providers, reinforcing a trend towards centralization that has raised concerns
about privacy, competition, resilience and Web QoE. The goal of this work is to
let users take advantage of third-party DNS services, without sacrificing
privacy or performance. We follow Wheeler's advice, adding another level of
indirection with an end-system DNS resolver, Onoma, that improves privacy,
avoiding DNS-based user-reidentification by inserting and sharding requests
across resolvers, and improves performance by running resolution races among
resolvers and reinstating the client-resolver proximity assumption content
delivery networks rely on. As our evaluation shows, while there may not be an
ideal service for all clients in all places, Onoma dynamically finds the best
service for any given location.

With recent progress of DNN, almost all image classification tasks have
achieved new records of accuracy. To extend the ability of DNN to image
retrieval tasks, we proposed a unified DNN model for image-query similarity
calculation by simultaneously modeling image and query in one network. The
unified DNN is named the cross space mapping (CSM) model, which contains two
parts, a convolutional part and a query-embedding part. The image and query are
mapped to a common vector space via these two parts respectively, and
image-query similarity is naturally defined as an inner product of their
mappings in the space. To ensure good generalization ability of the DNN, we
learn weights of the DNN from a large number of click-through logs which
consists of 23 million clicked image-query pairs between 1 million images and
11.7 million queries. Both the qualitative results and quantitative results on
an image retrieval evaluation task with 1000 queries demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

coordinated optimization methods, such as the Lagrangian relaxation and Benders

Iterative coordination methods have drawbacks including slow convergence, risk
of oscillation and divergence, and incapability of multi-level optimization
problems. To this end, this paper aims at the non-iterative coordinated
optimization method for hierarchical power systems. The theory of the
equivalent projection (EP) is proposed, which makes external equivalence of the
optimal dispatch model of the subsystem. Based on the EP theory, a coordinated
optimization framework is developed, where each subsystem submits the EP model
as a substitute for its original model to participate in the cross-system

characters; therefore, makeup for 3D facial models is highly in demand in
productions. However, painting directly on 3D faces and capturing real-world
makeup are costly, and extracting makeup from 2D images often struggles with
shading effects and occlusions. This paper presents the first method for
extracting makeup for 3D facial models from a single makeup portrait. Our
method consists of the following three steps. First, we exploit the strong
prior of 3D morphable models via regression-based inverse rendering to extract
coarse materials such as geometry and diffuse/specular albedos that are
represented in the UV space. Second, we refine the coarse materials, which may
have missing pixels due to occlusions. We apply inpainting and optimization.
Finally, we extract the bare skin, makeup, and an alpha matte from the diffuse
albedo. Our method offers various applications for not only 3D facial models
but also 2D portrait images. The extracted makeup is well-aligned in the UV
space, from which we build a large-scale makeup dataset and a parametric makeup
model for 3D faces. Our disentangled materials also yield robust makeup
transfer and illumination-aware makeup interpolation/removal without a
reference image.

the prespecified error tolerance and can obtain the exact EP model if the error
tolerance is set to zero, which provides flexibility to balance the computation
accuracy and effort. Applications of the EP-based coordinated dispatch are
demonstrated based on the multi-area coordination and transmission-distribution
coordination. Case studies with a wide range of system scales verify the
superiority of the proposed projection algorithm in terms of computational
efficiency and scalability, and validate the effectiveness of the EP-based
coordinated dispatch in comparison with the joint optimization.

However, integration of this functionality in therapeutic wound dressings is
still challenging. We hypothesised that a theranostic dressing could be
realised by integrating a collagen-based wound contact layer with previously
demonstrated wound healing capability, and a halochromic dye, i.e. bromothymol
blue (BTB), undergoing colour change following infection-associated pH changes
(pH: 5-6 --> >7). Two different BTB integration strategies, i.e.
electrospinning and drop-casting, were pursued to introduce long-lasting visual
infection detection capability through retention of BTB within the dressing.
Both systems had an average BTB loading efficiency of 99 wt.% and displayed a
colour change within one minute of contact with simulated wound fluid.
Drop-cast samples retained up to 85 wt.% of BTB after 96 hours in a
near-infected wound environment, in contrast to the fibre-bearing prototypes,
which released over 80 wt.% of BTB over the same time period. An increase in
collagen denaturation temperature (DSC) and red shifts (ATR-FTIR) suggests the
formation of secondary interactions between the collagen-based hydrogel and the
BTB, which are attributed to count for the long-lasting dye confinement and
durable dressing colour change. Given the high L929 fibroblast viability in
drop-cast sample extracts (92%, 7 days), the presented multiscale design is
simple, cell- and regulatory-friendly, and compliant with industrial scale-up.
This design, therefore, offers a new platform for the development of
theranostic dressings enabling accelerated wound healing and prompt infection

are mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that travel to schedule UL
transmissions and collect data from devices. To attain an ultra-reliable
unified device-centric performance, the UL connection is established when the
UAV-BS is hovering at the nearest possible distance from the scheduled device.
The performance of the proposed URDC-UL scheme is benchmarked against a
stationary UAV-centric uplink (SUC-UL) scheme where the devices are scheduled
to communicate to UAV-BSs that are continuously hovering at static locations.
Utilizing stochastic geometry and queueing theory, novel spatiotemporal
mathematical models are developed, which account for the UAV-BS spatial
densities, mobility, altitude, antenna directivity, ground-to-air channel, and
temporal traffic, among other factors. The results demonstrate the sensitivity
of the URDC-UL scheme to the ratio between hovering and traveling time. In
particular, the hovering to traveling time ratio should be carefully adjusted
to maximize the harvested performance gains for the URDC-UL scheme in terms of
link reliability, transmission rate, energy efficiency, and delay. Exploiting
the URDC-UL scheme allows IoT devices to minimize transmission power while
maintaining unified reliable transmission. This preserves the device's battery

down the numerical resolution parameters appropriate for physical scans. The
dependence of the modelled (4, 1) kink mode on the external rotational

of the static algorithm and avoids the recomputations for the nodes unaffected

distinguishes between growth arrest due to nutrient insufficiency and
competition for space and exhibits three growth regimes: nutrient-limited (NL),

coexist. We study the effect of RT for tumours in each regime, finding that
tumours in the SL regime typically respond best to RT, while tumours in the BS

representing raw points, grid-based voxels or pillars. Recent two-stage 3D

stage resorts to the 3D voxel-based backbone for 3D proposal generation on
bird-eye-view (BEV) representation and the second stage refines them via the
intermediate point representation. Their primary mechanisms involve the
utilization of intermediary keypoints to restore the substantial 3D structure

interaction, however, makes the entire detection pipeline more complex and
compute-intensive. In this paper, we take a different viewpoint -- the
pillar-based BEV representation owns sufficient capacity to preserve the 3D

conceptually simple yet effective two-stage 3D detection architecture, named
Pillar R-CNN. On top of densified BEV feature maps, Pillar R-CNN can easily
introduce the feature pyramid architecture to generate 3D proposals at various

bodies that played a crucial role in multiple reshuffling events throughout the
solar system and in both early and late accretion of planets. Application of
thermo-chronometers to meteorites provides precise dating of the formation age
of mineralogical components. Nucleosynthetic anomalies indicating a dichotomy
between NC and C meteorites and precise parent body (PB) chronology can be
combined with thermal evolution models to constrain the timescale of accretion
and dynamical processes in the early solar system. Achondrite PBs are
considered to have accreted early and mostly in the NC region, while late
accretion in the C region produced mostly undifferentiated PBs, such as the CR
chondrite PB that formed as late as 4 Ma after CAIs. However, presence of more
evolved CR-related meteorites suggests also an earlier accretion timing. We
present modeling evidence for a temporally distributed accretion of parent
bodies of CR-related meteorite groups that originate from a C reservoir and
range from aqueously altered chondrites to partially differentiated primitive
achondrites. The PB formation times derived range from <1 Ma to ~4 Ma after
solar system formation, with ~3.7 Ma, ~1.5-2.75 Ma, <~0.6 Ma, and <~0.7 Ma for
CR, Flensburg, NWA 6704, and NWA 011. This implies that accretion processes in
the C reservoir started as early as in the NC reservoir and produced
differentiated PBs with carbonaceous compositions in addition to
undifferentiated C chondritic PBs. The accretion times correlate inversely with
the degree of the meteorites' alteration, metamorphism, or differentiation.
Accretion times for CI/CM, Ryugu, and Tafassites PBs of ~3.75 Ma, ~1-3 Ma, and
1.1 Ma, respectively, fit well into this correlation in agreement with the
thermal and alteration conditions suggested by the meteorites.

the light-absorbing semiconductor, which must contain a collection of in-gap
levels, called intermediate band (IB), optically coupled to but thermally

Quantum-dot-in-perovskite (QDiP) solids, where inorganic quantum dots (QDs) are

promising material platform for developing IBSCs. In this work, QDiP solids
with excellent morphological and structural quality and strong absorption and

them, QDiP-based IBSCs are fabricated and, by means of temperature-dependent
photocurrent measurements, it is shown that the IB is strongly thermally

IB$\rightarrow$CB thermal escape of electrons is measured to be 204 meV,
resulting in the mitigation of this detrimental process even under
room-temperature operation, thus fulfilling the first mandatory requisite to

  Compressed JPEG Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is a fundamental task that allows a robotic
platform to successfully localise itself in the environment. For decentralised
VPR applications where the visual data has to be transmitted between several
agents, the communication channel may restrict the localisation process when
limited bandwidth is available. JPEG is an image compression standard that can
employ high compression ratios to facilitate lower data transmission for VPR
applications. However, when applying high levels of JPEG compression, both the
image clarity and size are drastically reduced. In this paper, we incorporate
sequence-based filtering in a number of well-established, learnt and non-learnt
VPR techniques to overcome the performance loss resulted from introducing high
levels of JPEG compression. The sequence length that enables 100% place
matching performance is reported and an analysis of the amount of data required
for each VPR technique to perform the transfer on the entire spectrum of JPEG
compression is provided. Moreover, the time required by each VPR technique to
perform place matching is investigated, on both uniformly and non-uniformly
JPEG compressed data. The results show that it is beneficial to use a highly
compressed JPEG dataset with an increased sequence length, as similar levels of
VPR performance are reported at a significantly reduced bandwidth. The results
presented in this paper also emphasize that there is a trade-off between the
amount of data transferred and the total time required to perform VPR. Our
experiments also suggest that is often favourable to compress the query images
to the same quality of the map, as more efficient place matching can be
performed. The experiments are conducted on several VPR datasets, under mild to
extreme JPEG compression.

observations of the open cluster NGC~2516 as an unrelated X-ray source. An
X-ray timing and spectral analysis of the eROSITA data is presented and
supplemented by an analysis of TESS photometry and SALT spectroscopy. X-ray
photometry reveals two pronounced dips repeating with a period of $106.144(1)$

identification spectrum obtained with SALT displays hydrogen Balmer emission
lines on a fairly blue continuum. The spectrum and the stability of the
photometric signal led to the classification of the new object as a polar-type
cataclysmic variable. In this picture, the dips in the X-ray light curve are
explained by absorption in the intervening accretion stream and by a
self-eclipse of the main accretion region. The object displays large magnitude
differences on long (months) timescales both at optical and X-ray wavelengths,
being interpreted as high and low states and thus supporting the identification
as a polar. The bright phase X-ray spectrum can be reflected with single
temperature thermal emission with 9.7 keV and bolometric X-ray luminosity

from the small source dataset for building a classifier. We then integrate
three different pre-trained models (Xception, ResNet101V2, and
InceptionResNetV2) into the classifier network and compare their performance on
source and target data. We use the classifier to detect the presence of
imperfections on the unseen target data using pseudo-bounding boxes. Our
results show that ResNet101V2 performs best on the source data with an accuracy
of 95.72%. Xception performs best on the target data with an accuracy of 91.00%

a pre-trained model is not dependent on the depth of the network. Our proposed

dipole moment that generally makes a finite angle with its rotation axis. As a
consequence, the emission of magnetic dipole radiation (MDR) continuously takes
away its rotational energy. This process leads to a time decreasing angular
velocity of the star that is usually quantified in terms of its braking index.
While this simple mechanism is indeed the main reason for the spin evolution of
isolated pulsars, it may not be the only cause of this effect. Most of young
isolated pulsars present braking index values that are consistently lower than
that given by the MDR model. Working in the weak field (Newtonian) limit, we
take in the present work a step forward in describing the evolution of such a
system by allowing the star's shape to wobble around an ellipsoidal
configuration as a backreaction effect produced by the MDR emission. It is
assumed that an internal damping of the oscillations occurs, thus introducing
another form of energy loss in the system, and this phenomenon may be related
to the deviation of the braking index from the pure MDR model predictions.
Numerical calculations suggest that the average braking index for typical
isolated pulsars can be thus simply explained.

cells by mechanical energy derived from metabolism. Characterizing the living
cytoplasm as a non-equilibrium system is crucial in elucidating the intricate
mechanism that relates cell mechanics to metabolic activities. In this study,
we conducted active and passive microrheology in eukaryotic cells, and
quantified non-thermal fluctuations from the violation of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The power spectral density corresponding
to active force generation was then estimated following the Langevin theory
extended to non-equilibrium systems. Experiments performed while regulating
cellular metabolic activity showed that the non-thermal displacement
fluctuation, rather than the active non-thermal force, directly correlates with
metabolism. We discuss how mechanoenzymes in living cells do not act as a
collection of microscopic objects; rather, they generate meso-scale collective
fluctuations that directly correlate with enzymatic activity. The correlation
is lost at long time scales because of the mesoscopic structural relaxations
induced by the metabolic activities. Since the efficiency with which energy is
converted to non-thermal fluctuations decreases as the cytoplasm becomes
fluidic, the fluidization of the cytoplasm stops at critical jamming. With or
without structural relaxations in the cytoplasm, we show that the probe
particle's non-thermal fluctuation is a good measure for metabolic activities.

studied the electronic and magnetic properties of alkali sodium superoxide
(NaO2) in comparison with that of potassium superoxide (KO2) both at high and
low temperatures. These properties of these superoxides are governed by the
unpaired electron donated by the alkali atoms Na and K to the O atoms forming
dimers. This unpaired electron is the source of orbital fluctuations in the
O-{\pi}* manifold for both cases. In order to reduce this orbital fluctuation,
both go through several structural phase transitions. In these plethora of
structures, the O2- dimers undergo rotation, leading to a complex linking of
its orbital degrees of freedom with its spin degrees of freedom. Hence the
magnetic properties are found to be controlled by this unpaired electron vary
as the orientations of these O2 - dimers change. Due to the change in the
orientations of O2- dimers, the alkali ion cages around the O2 - dimers change
from square in the pyrite phase to rhombus and rectangle for the orthorhombic
phase for NaO2 and square in the tetragonal phase to parallelogram in the
monoclinic phase for KO2 on the plane cutting through the dimers. The band
structures of NaO2 in the low-temperature orthorhombic phase and KO2 in the
monoclinic phase show that the lifting of degeneracy in the O-{\pi}* manifold
is due to the redefined electrostatic interaction between the K/Na cages and
the O2 - dimers. This, inaddition to electron correlation among the localized
O-{\pi}* electrons, establishes complete orbital ordering (OO) in turn drives
metal-insulator transition (MIT) in both the systems. Furthermore, K doping for
Na in NaO2 also results in correlation-induced MIT, predicted to take place at
a temperature higher than that in NaO2. This opens up the possibility of MIT in
Rb/Cs-doped NaO2 at even higher temperatures.

data more pervasive, intricate, and with a non-regular structure. With
classical techniques facing troubles to deal with the irregular (non-Euclidean)
domain where the signals are defined, a popular approach at the heart of graph
signal processing (GSP) is to: (i) represent the underlying support via a graph
and (ii) exploit the topology of this graph to process the signals at hand. In
addition to the irregular structure of the signals, another critical limitation
is that the observed data is prone to the presence of perturbations, which, in
the context of GSP, may affect not only the observed signals but also the
topology of the supporting graph. Ignoring the presence of perturbations, along
with the couplings between the errors in the signal and the errors in their
support, can drastically hinder estimation performance. While many GSP works
have looked at the presence of perturbations in the signals, much fewer have
looked at the presence of perturbations in the graph, and almost none at their
joint effect. While this is not surprising (GSP is a relatively new field), we
expect this to change in the upcoming years. Motivated by the previous
discussion, the goal of this thesis is to advance toward a robust GSP paradigm
where the algorithms are carefully designed to incorporate the influence of
perturbations in the graph signals, the graph support, and both. To do so, we
consider different types of perturbations, evaluate their disruptive impact on
fundamental GSP tasks, and design robust algorithms to address them.

in principle be used for interstellar interferometry. Changes of the dynamic
spectra as a function of pulsar longitude were in the past interpreted as
having spatially resolved the pulsar magnetosphere. Guided by this prospect we
used VLBI observations of PSR B1237+25 with the Arecibo and Green Bank radio
telescopes at 324 MHz and analyzed such scintillations at separate longitudes
of the pulse profile. We found that the fringe phase characteristics of the
visibility function changed quasi-sinusoidally as a function of longitude.
Also, the dynamic spectra from each of the telescopes shifted in frequency as a
function of longitude. Similar effects were found for PSR B1133+16. However, we
show that these effects are not signatures of having resolved the pulsar
magnetosphere. Instead the changes can be related to the effect of low-level
digitizing of the pulsar signal. After correcting for these effects the
frequency shifts largely disappeared. Residual effects may be partly due to
feed polarization impurities. In view of our analysis we think that
observations with the intend of spatially resolving the pulsar magnetosphere
need to be critically evaluated in terms of these constraints on interstellar
interferometry.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current class-incremental learning research mainly focuses on single-label
classification tasks while multi-label class-incremental learning (MLCIL) with
more practical application scenarios is rarely studied. Although there have
been many anti-forgetting methods to solve the problem of catastrophic
forgetting in class-incremental learning, these methods have difficulty in
solving the MLCIL problem due to label absence and information dilution. In
this paper, we propose a knowledge restore and transfer (KRT) framework for
MLCIL, which includes a dynamic pseudo-label (DPL) module to restore the old
class knowledge and an incremental cross-attention(ICA) module to save
session-specific knowledge and transfer old class knowledge to the new model
sufficiently. Besides, we propose a token loss to jointly optimize the
incremental cross-attention module. Experimental results on MS-COCO and PASCAL
VOC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for improving
recognition performance and mitigating forgetting on multi-label
class-incremental learning tasks.

expert's demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments.
Most existing imitation learning methods that do not require interacting with
environments either model the expert distribution as the conditional
probability p(a|s) (e.g., behavioral cloning, BC) or the joint probability p(s,
a) (e.g., implicit behavioral cloning). Despite its simplicity, modeling the
conditional probability with BC usually struggles with generalization. While
modeling the joint probability can lead to improved generalization performance,
the inference procedure can be time-consuming and it often suffers from
manifold overfitting. This work proposes an imitation learning framework that
benefits from modeling both the conditional and joint probability of the expert
distribution. Our proposed diffusion model-augmented behavioral cloning (DBC)
employs a diffusion model trained to model expert behaviors and learns a policy
to optimize both the BC loss (conditional) and our proposed diffusion model
loss (joint). DBC outperforms baselines in various continuous control tasks in
navigation, robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. We
design additional experiments to verify the limitations of modeling either the
conditional probability or the joint probability of the expert distribution as
well as compare different generative models.

impairs the mobility of senior citizens. The lack of sufficient data in the
medical field is always a challenge for training a learning model due to the
high cost of labelling. At present, Deep neural network training strongly
depends on data augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability
and avoid over-fitting. However, existing data augmentation operations, such as
rotation, gamma correction, etc., are designed based on the original data,
which does not substantially increase the data diversity. In this paper, we
propose a learning model based on the convolutional Auto-Encoder and a hybrid
loss strategy to generate new data for early KOA (KL-0 vs KL-2) diagnosis. Four
hidden layers are designed among the encoder and decoder, which represent the
key and unrelated features of each input, respectively. Then, two key feature
vectors are exchanged to obtain the generated images. To do this, a hybrid loss
function is derived using different loss functions with optimized weights to
supervise the reconstruction and key-exchange learning. Experimental results
show that the generated data are valid as they can significantly improve the
model's classification performance.

methods to large scale atmosphere and ocean simulation. Compatible finite
element methods extend Arakawa's C-grid finite difference scheme to the finite
element world. They are constructed from a discrete de Rham complex, which is a
sequence of finite element spaces which are linked by the operators of
differential calculus. The use of discrete de Rham complexes to solve partial
differential equations is well established, but in this article we focus on the
specifics of dynamical cores for simulating weather, oceans and climate. The
most important consequence of the discrete de Rham complex is the
Hodge-Helmholtz decomposition, which has been used to exclude the possibility
of several types of spurious oscillations from linear equations of geophysical
flow. This means that compatible finite element spaces provide a useful
framework for building dynamical cores. In this article we introduce the main
concepts of compatible finite element spaces, and discuss their wave
propagation properties. We survey some methods for discretising the transport
terms that arise in dynamical core equation systems, and provide some example
discretisations, briefly discussing their iterative solution. Then we focus on
the recent use of compatible finite element spaces in designing structure
preserving methods, surveying variational discretisations, Poisson bracket
discretisations, and consistent vorticity transport.

two types of background knowledge: pairwise constraints and monotonicity

objective function which combines the proposed distance measure and a pairwise
constraint-based penalty term, in order to fuse both types of information. This
objective function can be optimized with an EM optimization scheme. The
proposed method serves as the first approach to the problem it addresses, as it

to the impact of the higher nonlinear term on the modulation instability.
Following that, full numerical integration was performed to identify modulated
wave patterns, as well as the appearance of a rogue wave. Through the nonlinear
supratransmission phenomenon, one end of the discrete model is driven into the
forbidden bandgap. As a result, for driving amplitudes above the
supratransmission threshold, the solitonic bright soliton and modulated wave
patterns are satisfied. An important behavior is observed in the transient
range of time of propagation when the bright solitonic wave turns into a
chaotic solitonic wave. These results corroborate our analytical investigations
on the modulation instability and show that the one-dimensional chain of atoms
is a fruitful medium to generate long-lived modulated waves.

wide range of activities. As a result, the number of VC users surged sharply.
The sharp increase in VC usage has been accompanied by various newly emerging
privacy and security challenges. VC meetings became a target for various
security attacks, such as Zoombombing. Other VC-related challenges also
emerged. For example, during COVID lockdowns, educators had to teach in online
environments struggling with keeping students engaged for extended periods. In
parallel, the amount of available VC videos has grown exponentially. Thus,
users and companies are limited in finding abnormal segments in VC meetings
within the converging volumes of data. Such abnormal events that affect most
meeting participants may be indicators of interesting points in time, including
security attacks or other changes in meeting climate, like someone joining a
meeting or sharing a dramatic content. Here, we present a novel algorithm for
detecting abnormal events in VC data. We curated VC publicly available
recordings, including meetings with interruptions. We analyzed the videos using
our algorithm, extracting time windows where abnormal occurrences were
detected. Our algorithm is a pipeline that combines multiple methods in several
steps to detect users' faces in each video frame, track face locations during
the meeting and generate vector representations of a facial expression for each
face in each frame. Vector representations are used to monitor changes in
facial expressions throughout the meeting for each participant. The overall
change in meeting climate is quantified using those parameters across all
participants, and translating them into event anomaly detection. This is the
first open pipeline for automatically detecting anomaly events in VC meetings.
Our model detects abnormal events with 92.3% precision over the collected
dataset.

for its flexibility, extensibility, and high deployability in recent years. The
application of clustering scheme for UAV ad hoc network is imperative to
enhance the performance of throughput and energy efficiency. In conventional
clustering scheme, a single cluster head (CH) is always assigned in each
cluster. However, this method has some weaknesses such as overload and
premature death of CH when the number of UAVs increased. In order to solve this
problem, we propose a dual-cluster-head based medium access control (DCHMAC)
scheme for large-scale UAV networks. In DCHMAC, two CHs are elected to manage
resource allocation and data forwarding cooperatively. Specifically, two CHs
work on different channels. One of CH is used for intra-cluster communication
and the other one is for inter-cluster communication. A Markov chain model is
developed to analyse the throughput of the network. Simulation result shows
that compared with FM-MAC (flying ad hoc networks multi-channel MAC,FM-MAC),
DCHMAC improves the throughput by approximately 20%-50% and prolongs the
network lifetime by approximately 40%.

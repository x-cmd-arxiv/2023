minimal set of vertices of size at least $k$ whose deletion destroys all
cycles. We present several results that improve upon the state of the art of
the parameterized complexity of this problem with respect to both structural
and natural parameters.
  Using standard DP techniques, we first present an algorithm of time
$\textrm{tw}^{O(\textrm{tw})}n^{O(1)}$, significantly generalizing a recent
algorithm of Gaikwad et al. of time $\textrm{vc}^{O(\textrm{vc})}n^{O(1)}$,
where $\textrm{tw}, \textrm{vc}$ denote the input graph's treewidth and vertex
cover respectively. Subsequently, we show that both of these algorithms are
essentially optimal, since a $\textrm{vc}^{o(\textrm{vc})}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm
would refute the ETH.
  With respect to the natural parameter $k$, the aforementioned recent work by
Gaikwad et al. claimed an FPT branching algorithm with complexity $10^k
n^{O(1)}$. We point out that this algorithm is incorrect and present a
branching algorithm of complexity $9.34^k n^{O(1)}$.

  Online and Offline Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Utilizing messages from teammates can improve coordination in cooperative
Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Previous works typically combine raw
messages of teammates with local information as inputs for policy. However,
neglecting message aggregation poses significant inefficiency for policy
learning. Motivated by recent advances in representation learning, we argue
that efficient message aggregation is essential for good coordination in
cooperative MARL. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent communication via
Self-supervised Information Aggregation (MASIA), where agents can aggregate the
received messages into compact representations with high relevance to augment
the local policy. Specifically, we design a permutation invariant message
encoder to generate common information-aggregated representation from messages
and optimize it via reconstructing and shooting future information in a
self-supervised manner. Hence, each agent would utilize the most relevant parts
of the aggregated representation for decision-making by a novel message
extraction mechanism. Furthermore, considering the potential of offline
learning for real-world applications, we build offline benchmarks for
multi-agent communication, which is the first as we know. Empirical results
demonstrate the superiority of our method in both online and offline settings.
We also release the built offline benchmarks in this paper as a testbed for
communication ability validation to facilitate further future research.

guidance on dose optimization, which outlines various approaches to achieve
this goal. One highlighted approach involves conducting a randomized phase II
trial following the completion of a phase I trial, where multiple doses
(typically including the MTD and one or two doses lower than the MTD) are
compared to identify the optimal dose that maximizes the benefit-risk tradeoff.
This paper focuses on the design of such a multiple-dose randomized trial,
specifically the determination of the sample size. We propose a MERIT

information science and technology. Establishing an efficient interface between
optical photons and nuclear spins, while highly desirable for hybridizing these
two quantum systems, is challenging because the interactions between nuclear
spins and the environment are usually weak in magnitude, and there is also a
formidable gap between nuclear spin frequencies and optical frequencies. In
this work, we propose an opto-nuclear quadrupolar (ONQ) effect, whereby optical
photons can be efficiently coupled to nuclear spins, similar to Raman
scattering. Compared to previous works, ancilla electron spins are not required
for the ONQ effect. This leads to advantages such as applicability in
defect-free nonmagnetic crystals and longer nuclear spin coherence time. In
addition, the frequency of the optical photons can be arbitrary, so they can be
fine-tuned to minimize the material heating and to match telecom wavelengths
for long-distance communications. Using perturbation theory and
first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the ONQ effect is stronger
by several orders of magnitude than other nonlinear optical effects that could
couple to nuclear spins. Based on this rationale, we propose promising
applications of the ONQ effect, including quantum memory, quantum transduction,
and materials isotope spectroscopy. We also discuss issues relevant to the
experimental demonstration of the ONQ effect.

show that strain and broken rotational symmetry in moire pattern of CTBG are

  perovskites",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anharmonicity and disorder are ubiquitous in the physics of perovskites and
give rise to several unique phenomena observed in scattering and spectroscopy
experiments with profound consequences for device applications. Several of
these phenomena still lack interpretation from a first-principles perspective
since, hitherto, no approach is available to account for anharmonicity and
disorder in the phonon dynamics and electron-phonon couplings. Here, relying on
the special displacement method, we develop a unified framework for the
treatment of both and demonstrate that electron-phonon coupling in cubic oxide
and halide perovskites is strongly influenced by the multi-well potential
energy landscape. We uncover that disorder is at the origin of phonon bunching
and overdamping in halide perovskites leading to vibrational dynamics far from
the ideal phonon picture. We also clarify a long standing problem in electronic
structure calculations of cubic perovskites and show that band gap corrections
arising from disorder, spin-orbit coupling, more accurate exchange-correlation
functionals, and electron-phonon coupling are all essential. Our results are in
excellent agreement with scattering and optical spectroscopy measurements,
suggesting that disorder is the key to address pending questions on
perovskites' technological applications.

benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model
has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the
student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that

(HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with
iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the
teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target

ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing

heterogeneity, which is commonly observed in the emerging federated learning

we propose a magnitude-driven sparsification scheme, which addresses the
non-convergence issue of SIGNSGD while further improving communication
efficiency. Moreover, the local update scheme is further incorporated to
improve the learning performance, and the convergence of the proposed method is

addition, spectral analysis of the different terms of the generalized Ohm's law

is examined using von-K\'arm\'an Howarth (vKH) equation based on incompressible

their domain goals through collaborative dialogue. The system does this by
inferring users' intentions and plans to achieve those goals, detects whether
obstacles are present, finds plans to overcome them or to achieve higher-level
goals, and plans its actions, including speech acts,to help users accomplish
those goals. In doing so, the system maintains and reasons with its own
beliefs, goals and intentions, and explicitly reasons about those of its user.
Belief reasoning is accomplished with a modal Horn-clause meta-interpreter. The
planning and reasoning subsystems obey the principles of persistent goals and
intentions, including the formation and decomposition of intentions to perform
complex actions, as well as the conditions under which they can be given up. In
virtue of its planning process, the system treats its speech acts just like its
other actions -- physical acts affect physical states, digital acts affect
digital states, and speech acts affect mental and social states. This general
approach enables Eva to plan a variety of speech acts including requests,
informs, questions, confirmations, recommendations, offers, acceptances,
greetings, and emotive expressions. Each of these has a formally specified
semantics which is used during the planning and reasoning processes. Because it
can keep track of different users' mental states, it can engage in multi-party
dialogues. Importantly, Eva can explain its utterances because it has created a
plan standing behind each of them. Finally, Eva employs multimodal input and
output, driving an avatar that can perceive and employ facial and head
movements along with emotive speech acts.

However, attaining ground-truth labels is costly for many tasks. Alternatively,
weakly supervised methods learn with cheap weak signals that only approximately
label some data. Many existing weakly supervised learning methods learn a
deterministic function that estimates labels given the input data and weak
signals. In this paper, we develop label learning flows (LLF), a general
framework for weakly supervised learning problems. Our method is a generative
model based on normalizing flows. The main idea of LLF is to optimize the
conditional likelihoods of all possible labelings of the data within a
constrained space defined by weak signals. We develop a training method for LLF
that trains the conditional flow inversely and avoids estimating the labels.
Once a model is trained, we can make predictions with a sampling algorithm. We
apply LLF to three weakly supervised learning problems. Experiment results show
that our method outperforms many baselines we compare against.

sparsifying graph edges over distributed graphs, when graph edges with possibly
edge duplicates are observed at physically remote sites. Although edge
duplicates across different sites appear to be beneficial at the first glance,
in fact they could make the clustering and sparsification more complicated
since potentially their processing would need extra computations and
communications. We propose the first communication-optimal algorithms for two
well-established communication models namely the message passing and the
blackboard models. Specifically, given a graph on $n$ nodes with edges observed
at $s$ sites, our algorithms achieve communication costs $\tilde{O}(ns)$ and
$\tilde{O}(n+s)$ ($\tilde{O}$ hides a polylogarithmic factor), which almost
match their lower bounds, $\Omega(ns)$ and $\Omega(n+s)$, in the message
passing and the blackboard models respectively. The communication costs are
asymptotically the same as those under non-duplication models, under an
assumption on edge distribution. Our algorithms can also guarantee clustering
quality nearly as good as that of centralizing all edges and then applying any
standard clustering algorithm. Moreover, we perform the first investigation of
distributed constructions of graph spanners in the blackboard model. We provide
almost matching communication lower and upper bounds for both multiplicative
and additive spanners. For example, the communication lower bounds of
constructing a $(2k-1)$-spanner in the blackboard with and without duplication
models are $\Omega(s+n^{1+1/k}\log s)$ and
$\Omega(s+n^{1+1/k}\max\{1,s^{-1/2-1/(2k)}\log s\})$ respectively, which almost

domain while preserving its sizes under the Lebesgue measure. In quantum
confined systems, this transformation leads to so-called quantum shape effects
in the physical properties of confined particles associated with the Dirichlet
spectrum of the confining medium. Here we show that the geometric couplings
between levels generated by the size-invariant shape transformations cause
nonuniform scaling in the eigenspectra. In particular, the nonuniform level
scaling is characterized by two distinct spectral features: lowering of the
first eigenvalue (ground state reduction) and changing of the spectral gaps
(energy level splitting or degeneracy formation depending on the symmetries).
We explain the ground state reduction by the increase in local breadth (i.e.
parts of the domain becoming less confined) that is associated with the
sphericity of these local portions of the domain. We accurately quantify the
sphericity using two different measures: the radius of the inscribed $n$-sphere
and the Hausdorff distance. Due to Rayleigh-Faber-Krahn inequality, the greater
the sphericity, the lower the first eigenvalue. Then, level splitting or
degeneracy, depending on the symmetries of the initial configuration, becomes a
direct consequence of size-invariance dictating the eigenvalues to have the
same asymptotic behavior due to Weyl law. Furthermore, we find that the ground
state reduction causes a quantum thermal avalanche which is the underlying
reason for the peculiar effect of spontaneous transitions to lower entropy
states in systems exhibiting the quantum shape effect. Unusual spectral
characteristics of size-preserving transformations can assist in designing
confinement geometries that could lead to classically inconceivable quantum
thermal machines.

filesystem replicas is one of the main theoretical problems in Operational
Transformation (OT) and Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT) frameworks.
Based on the Algebraic Theory of Filesystems, which incorporates
non-commutative filesystem commands natively, we developed and built a
proof-of-concept implementation of an algorithm suite which synchronizes an
arbitrary number of replicas. The result is provably correct, and the
synchronized system is created in linear space and time after an initial
sorting phase. It works by identifying conflicting command pairs and requesting
one of the commands to be removed. The method can be guided to reach any of the
theoretically possible synchronized states. The algorithm also allows
asynchronous usage. After the client sends a synchronization request, the local
replica remains available for further modifications. When the synchronization
instructions arrive, they can be merged with the changes made since the
synchronization request. The suite also works on filesystems with directed
acyclic graph-based path structure in place of the traditional tree-like
arrangement. Consequently, our algorithms apply to filesystems with hard or
soft links as long as the links create no loops.

kinematics of those systems that may lock at the velocity separation of the CIV
$\lambda\lambda 1548.19,1550.77$ doublet. We find that a small volume of the

luminosity variations is quantified with implications for the long-term
variability amplitude of quasars and the velocity-separation statistic between

the hidden extreme-UV emission from quasars is unlikely to be significantly
under-estimated by current models. Further, the ratio of the LL velocity to the
outflow velocity may serve as a powerful constraint on the composition of the

displacement ($\mathrm{MSD}$) break down for non-ergodic processes, making it
challenging to characterize anomalous diffusion from an individual time-series

displacement $\mathrm{TA}$-$\mathrm{MSD}$ differs from the ensemble-averaged
mean squared displacement $\mathrm{EA}$-$\mathrm{MSD}$ even in the limit of
long measurement series. In these cases, the typical theoretical results for
ensemble averages cannot be used to understand and interpret data acquired from
time averages. The difficulty then lies in obtaining statistical descriptors of
the measured diffusion process that are not non-ergodic. We show that linear
descriptors such as the standard deviation ($SD$), coefficient of variation
($CV$), and root mean square ($RMS$) break ergodicity in proportion to
non-ergodicity in the diffusion process. In contrast, time series of
descriptors addressing sequential structure and its potential nonlinearity:
multifractality change in a time-independent way and fulfill the ergodic
assumption, largely independent of the time series' non-ergodicity. We show
that these findings follow the multiplicative cascades underlying these
diffusion processes. Adding fractal and multifractal descriptors to typical
linear descriptors would improve the characterization of anomalous diffusion
processes. Two particular points bear emphasis here. First, as an appropriate
formalism for encoding the nonlinearity that might generate non-ergodicity,
multifractal modeling offers descriptors that can behave ergodically enough to
meet the needs of linear modeling. Second, this capacity to describe
non-ergodic processes in ergodic terms offers the possibility that multifractal
modeling could unify several disparate non-ergodic diffusion processes into a

using a nonlinear modeling with a variable delay, introduced more than 20 years

This type of guarantee is desirable in many practical applications, as for

a high-level view of the WSI to determine various regions of interest. We
employ a custom sampling method to extract diverse and spatially distinct image
tiles from selected high attention areas. The second component is a hard
attention classification model, which further extracts a sequence of
multi-resolution glimpses from each tile for classification. Since hard
attention is non-differentiable, we train this component using reinforcement

a given tile, thereby aligning with pathologist's way of diagnosis. We train

optimization (AutoDO) using reinforcement learning (RL). Decision optimization
(DO) has classically being practiced by dedicated DO researchers where experts
need to spend long periods of time fine tuning a solution through
trial-and-error. AutoML pipeline search has sought to make it easier for a data
scientist to find the best machine learning pipeline by leveraging automation
to search and tune the solution. More recently, these advances have been
applied to the domain of AutoDO, with a similar goal to find the best
reinforcement learning pipeline through algorithm selection and parameter
tuning. However, Decision Optimization requires significantly more complex
problem specification when compared to an ML problem. AutoDOViz seeks to lower
the barrier of entry for data scientists in problem specification for
reinforcement learning problems, leverage the benefits of AutoDO algorithms for
RL pipeline search and finally, create visualizations and policy insights in
order to facilitate the typical interactive nature when communicating problem
formulation and solution proposals between DO experts and domain experts. In
this paper, we report our findings from semi-structured expert interviews with
DO practitioners as well as business consultants, leading to design
requirements for human-centered automation for DO with RL. We evaluate a system
implementation with data scientists and find that they are significantly more
open to engage in DO after using our proposed solution. AutoDOViz further
increases trust in RL agent models and makes the automated training and
evaluation process more comprehensible. As shown for other automation in ML
tasks, we also conclude automation of RL for DO can benefit from user and
vice-versa when the interface promotes human-in-the-loop.

  Holes: Towards a New Paradigm of Gravitational Collapse,"" C. Bambi editor
  (Springer)",,,,"gr-qc astro-ph.CO hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Gravitational vacuum condensate stars, proposed as the endpoint of
gravitational collapse consistent with quantum theory, are reviewed. Gravastars
are cold, low entropy, maximally compact objects characterized by a surface
boundary layer and physical surface tension, instead of an event horizon.
Within this thin boundary layer the effective vacuum energy changes rapidly,
and the interior of a non-rotating gravastar is a non-singular static patch of
de Sitter space with eq. of state p=-rho. Remarkably, essentially this same
result is obtained by extrapolating Schwarzschild's 1916 constant density
interior solution to its compact limit, showing how the black hole singularity
theorems and the Buchdahl compactness bound are evaded. The surface stress
tensor on the horizon is determined by a modification of the Lanczos-Israel
junction conditions for null hypersurfaces, which is applied to rotating
gravastar solutions as well. The fundamental basis for the quantum phase
transition at the horizon is the stress tensor of the conformal anomaly,
depending upon a new light scalar field in the low energy effective action for
gravity. This scalar allows the effective value of the vacuum energy, described
as a condensate of an exact 4-form abelian gauge field, to change at the
horizon. The resulting effective theory thus replaces the fixed constant Lambda
of classical general relativity, and its apparently unnaturally large
sensitivity to UV physics, with a dynamical condensate whose ground state value
in empty flat space is zero identically. This provides both a natural
resolution of the cosmological constant problem and an effective Lagrangian
dynamical framework for the boundary layer and interior of gravitational vacuum
condensate stars. The status of present observational constraints and prospects
for detection of gravastars through their gravitational wave and echo
signatures are discussed.

in mediation analysis, but the current methods only assume latent confounders
that affect treatment, mediator and outcome simultaneously, and fail to
identify different types of latent confounders (e.g., confounders that only

details but at the cost of extremely long processing time, existing DL methods
face challenges of gathering sufficient/qualitative ground truth (GT) for
robust training, thus leading to failure in maintaining clinically acceptable
false positive rates. We hereby propose a generalizable yet efficient workflow
of two stages: (1) training pairs generation with GT bone shadows eliminated in
by a physical model in spatially transformed gradient fields. (2) fully
supervised image denoising network training on stage-one datasets for fast rib
removal on incoming CXRs. For step two, we designed a densely connected network
called SADXNet, combined with peak signal to noise ratio and multi-scale
structure similarity index measure objective minimization to suppress bony
structures. The SADXNet organizes spatial filters in U shape (e.g., X=7;
filters = 16, 64, 256, 512, 256, 64, 16) and preserves the feature map
dimension throughout the network flow. Visually, SADXNet can suppress the rib
edge and that near the lung wall/vertebra without jeopardizing the
vessel/abnormality conspicuity. Quantitively, it achieves RMSE of ~0 during
testing with one prediction taking <1s. Downstream tasks including lung nodule

mechanisms of FRBs within the magnetar theoretical framework considering two
emission sites inside and outside the magnetosphere. For each site, we discuss
both intrinsic radiation mechanisms and propagation effects. Inside the
magnetosphere, we investigate the polarization properties of both coherent
curvature radiation and inverse Compton scattering by charged bunches and
conclude that both mechanisms produce 100\% linear polarization at an on-axis
geometry but can produce circular polarization if the viewing angle is off
axis. The lack of circular polarization for the majority of bursts requires
that the bunches have a large transverse dimension size. Resonant cyclotron
absorption within magnetosphere may produce high circular polarization if
electrons and positrons have an asymmetric Lorentz factor distribution. Outside
the magnetosphere, the synchrotron maser emission mechanism in general produces
highly linearly polarized emission. Circular polarization would appear at
off-beam angles but the flux is greatly degraded and such bursts are not
detectable at cosmological distances. Synchrotron absorption in a nebula with
ordered magnetic field may reduce the circular polarization degree. Cyclotron
absorption in a strongly magnetized medium may generate significant circular
polarization. Faraday conversion in a medium with field reversal can convert
one polarization mode to another. The two absorption processes require
stringent physical conditions. Significant Faraday conversion may be realized
in a magnetized dense environment involving binary systems or supernova
remnants.

utilizes two different kinds of gradient oracles. The first kind of oracles can
estimate the gradient of one point, and the second kind of oracles, less
precise and more cost-effective, can estimate the gradient difference between
two points. SpiderBoost uses the first kind periodically, once every few steps,
while our framework proposes using the first oracle whenever the total drift
has become large and relies on the second oracle otherwise. This new framework
ensures the gradient estimations remain accurate all the time, resulting in
improved rates for finding second-order stationary points.
  Moreover, we address a more challenging task of finding the global minima of
a non-convex objective using the exponential mechanism. Our findings indicate
that the regularized exponential mechanism can closely match previous empirical
and population risk bounds, without requiring smoothness assumptions for
algorithms with polynomial running time. Furthermore, by disregarding running
time considerations, we show that the exponential mechanism can achieve a good

single product. Buyers often use reviews from other customers that share their

purchase except at a low price, so for the seller, there is a tension between
setting high prices and ensuring that there are enough reviews so that buyers
can confidently estimate their values. Simultaneously, sellers may use reviews
to gauge the demand for items they wish to sell.
  In this work, we study this pricing problem in an online setting where the
seller interacts with a set of buyers of finitely-many types, one-by-one, over
a series of $T$ rounds. At each round, the seller first sets a price. Then a
buyer arrives and examines the reviews of the previous buyers with the same
type, which reveal those buyers' ex-post values. Based on the reviews, the
buyer decides to purchase if they have good reason to believe that their
ex-ante utility is positive. Crucially, the seller does not know the buyer's

no-regret algorithm that the seller can use to obtain high revenue. When there
are $d$ types, after $T$ rounds, our algorithm achieves a problem-independent

become substantially more challenging in the setting of nonlinear function

bounding the error with a favorable rate in high dimensions. We discuss

required in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for a variety of

distributions has not been fully developed. We here propose a novel blocked
Gibbs sampler for the MGIG distributions, based on the Choleski decomposition.
We show that the full conditionals of the diagonal and unit lower-triangular

that the average acceptance rates become extremely low in particular scenarios.

the evolution of the angle between two inputs to a ReLU neural network as a

precise formulas for how fast this angle goes to zero as depth increases. These
formulas capture microscopic fluctuations that are not visible in the popular

formulas are given in terms of the mixed moments of correlated Gaussians passed
through the ReLU function. We also find a surprising combinatorial connection
between these mixed moments and the Bessel numbers that allows us to explicitly
evaluate these moments.

requires measuring the received signal power at the user terminal for a

to extract the key statistical quantity for beamforming by exploring only a

beamforming guarantees a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) boost of Theta(N^{2L})

modern ASR systems that require long training times to adapt their large

language model post-processing, we tackle this problem on an earlier processing
level and eliminate the bias in acoustic modeling to recognize OOV words
acoustically. We propose to generate OOV words using text-to-speech systems and
to rescale losses to encourage neural networks to pay more attention to OOV
words. Specifically, we enlarge the classification loss used for training
neural networks' parameters of utterances containing OOV words
(sentence-level), or rescale the gradient used for back-propagation for OOV
words (word-level), when fine-tuning a previously trained model on synthetic
audio. To overcome catastrophic forgetting, we also explore the combination of
loss rescaling and model regularization, i.e. L2 regularization and elastic
weight consolidation (EWC). Compared with previous methods that just fine-tune
synthetic audio with EWC, the experimental results on the LibriSpeech benchmark
reveal that our proposed loss rescaling approach can achieve significant
improvement on the recall rate with only a slight decrease on word error rate.
Moreover, word-level rescaling is more stable than utterance-level rescaling
and leads to higher recall rates and precision on OOV word recognition.
Furthermore, our proposed combined loss rescaling and weight consolidation
methods can support continual learning of an ASR system.

Among other things, calculating the first-order derivative in such a problem
requires differentiation across the hierarchy, which is computationally

such bilevel programs, equivalent to multiple-followers Stackelberg games, with
two new hierarchy-free problems: a $T$-step Cournot game and a $T$-step

both can be efficiently solved via first-order methods. Importantly, we show
that the bounds provided by these problems -- the upper bound by the $T$-step
Cournot game and the lower bound by the $T$-step monopoly model -- can be made
arbitrarily tight by increasing the step parameter $T$ for a wide range of

spatiotemporal data in real-world scenarios is usually incomplete due to sensor
failures or transmission loss. Spatiotemporal imputation aims to fill the
missing values according to the observed values and the underlying
spatiotemporal dependence of them. The previous dominant models impute missing
values autoregressively and suffer from the problem of error accumulation. As
emerging powerful generative models, the diffusion probabilistic models can be
adopted to impute missing values conditioned by observations and avoid
inferring missing values from inaccurate historical imputation. However, the
construction and utilization of conditional information are inevitable
challenges when applying diffusion models to spatiotemporal imputation. To
address above issues, we propose a conditional diffusion framework for
spatiotemporal imputation with enhanced prior modeling, named PriSTI. Our
proposed framework provides a conditional feature extraction module first to
extract the coarse yet effective spatiotemporal dependencies from conditional
information as the global context prior. Then, a noise estimation module
transforms random noise to realistic values, with the spatiotemporal attention
weights calculated by the conditional feature, as well as the consideration of
geographic relationships. PriSTI outperforms existing imputation methods in
various missing patterns of different real-world spatiotemporal data, and
effectively handles scenarios such as high missing rates and sensor failure.

a variance decomposition approach is used to estimate the uncertainty of the

the HO phase was concluded to be due to electron/valence instability.

  Physical Systems",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Learning Enabled Components (LEC) have greatly assisted cyber-physical
systems in achieving higher levels of autonomy. However, LEC's susceptibility
to dynamic and uncertain operating conditions is a critical challenge for the
safety of these systems. Redundant controller architectures have been widely
adopted for safety assurance in such contexts. These architectures augment LEC
""performant"" controllers that are difficult to verify with ""safety"" controllers
and the decision logic to switch between them. While these architectures ensure
safety, we point out two limitations. First, they are trained offline to learn
a conservative policy of always selecting a controller that maintains the
system's safety, which limits the system's adaptability to dynamic and
non-stationary environments. Second, they do not support reverse switching from
the safety controller to the performant controller, even when the threat to
safety is no longer present. To address these limitations, we propose a dynamic
simplex strategy with an online controller switching logic that allows two-way
switching. We consider switching as a sequential decision-making problem and
model it as a semi-Markov decision process. We leverage a combination of a
myopic selector using surrogate models (for the forward switch) and a
non-myopic planner (for the reverse switch) to balance safety and performance.
We evaluate this approach using an autonomous vehicle case study in the CARLA
simulator using different driving conditions, locations, and component
failures. We show that the proposed approach results in fewer collisions and
higher performance than state-of-the-art alternatives.

In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may

important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we
expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine
learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and
classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits
optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types
of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4 to 16 qubits,
and applied ten different ans\""{a}tze with varying depths (ranging from 3 to
32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each
containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using
quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of
our dataset using real 4-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a

be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.

  To construct the magnitude homotopy type, we consider the poset structure on

  The magnitude homotopy type gives a covariant functor from the category of
metric spaces with $1$-Lipschitz maps to the category of pointed topological
spaces. The magnitude homotopy type also has a ``path integral'' like

the FRB with an optical galaxy at z = 0.1415, which is inconsistent with what
is expected from the Macquart scaling relation. We attribute the excess DM to

granular slabs. Such materials are often fractured by giant forces such as

material that can maintain a stable shape without being solidified. Here, we
focus on sand grains coated with silicone oil, experimentally investigating the
Young's modulus of a granular slab where ordinary grains and the coated grains

increases rapidly at $\alpha \ge 0.6$. We use numerical simulation to show that
this sudden increase in the Young's modulus is caused by a rigidity percolation
transition. Furthermore, we are able to show that granular slabs containing
coated sand have outstanding deformability without collapsing under large

Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered sensing fuses features of multiple
sensing views from devices distributed in edge networks for the edge server to
perform accurate inference. This process, known as multi-view pooling, creates
a communication bottleneck due to multi-access by many devices. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a task-oriented simultaneous access scheme for
distributed sensing called Over-the-Air Pooling (AirPooling). The existing
Over-the-Air Computing (AirComp) technique can be directly applied to enable
Average-AirPooling by exploiting the waveform superposition property of a
multi-access channel. However, despite being most popular in practice, the
over-the-air maximization, called Max-AirPooling, is not AirComp realizable as
AirComp addresses a limited subset of functions. We tackle the challenge by
proposing the novel generalized AirPooling framework that can be configured to
support both Max- and Average-AirPooling by controlling a configuration
parameter. The former is realized by adding to AirComp the designed
pre-processing at devices and post-processing at the server. To characterize
the end-to-end sensing performance, the theory of classification margin is
applied to relate the classification accuracy and the AirPooling error.
Furthermore, the analysis reveals an inherent tradeoff of Max-AirPooling
between the accuracy of the pooling-function approximation and the
effectiveness of noise suppression. Using the tradeoff, we optimize the
configuration parameter of Max-AirPooling, yielding a sub-optimal closed-form
method of adaptive parametric control. Experimental results obtained on
real-world datasets show that AirPooling provides sensing accuracies close to
those achievable by the traditional digital air interface but dramatically
reduces the communication latency.

demonstrations, our method estimates expert-like behaviors with higher values
to facilitate productive interactions, and adopts non-parametric regression to
enable such guidance at states unobserved in demonstration data. Extensive

thermal transport tuning in the near-junction thermal management of GaN
electronics, especially the topological phonon properties related to the
low-dissipative surface phonon states. In this work, a comprehensive study on
phonon modes and topological phonon properties is performed from the first
principles in (GaN)x/(AlN)x and (AlGaN)x/(GaN)x (x=1,2,3) superlattices. Phonon
modes including the dispersion relation, the density of state, and the
participation ratio are calculated for six GaN superlattices. Localized phonon
mode is not found based on the participation ratio results. In topological
phonon analyses, it is found that single Weyl phonons are present in all six
GaN superlattice structures consisting of the trivial (GaN) and nontrivial (AlN
and AlGaN) combinations and are located at two sides of the kz=0 plane
symmetrically in the Brillouin zone. With the increase of the phonon branches
in superlattices, the number of Weyl phonon points also increases from dozens
to hundreds. One Weyl phonon with significant and clean surface states is
selected and analyzed for each GaN superlattice. Among them, the Weyl phonon in
(GaN)2/(AlN)2 superlattice mainly results from the lattice vibration of Al and

used in detailed analysis of cataclysmic variables and statistical studies.
Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations, we found that
the orbital period is different from what has been adopted. Using the combined
data (TESS, the Zwicky Transient Facility data and VSNET campaigns), we updated
the period to be 0.19346802(4) d. The previously adopted period of 0.1766 d
turned out to be its 2-day alias, probably introduced by a confusion between
the two maxima/minima of the ellipsoidal variations. We confirmed that the
object showed grazing eclipses during the 2016 and 2002 outbursts, and also in
quiescence before and after the 2016 outburst. These eclipses were not
necessarily always present and were not remarkable during some past outbursts
and in the TESS data. The presence/absence of eclipses may be related to the
disk radius or the brightness of the outer part of the disk. A 37-min
quasi-period oscillation (QPO) signal was reported during the 2002 outburst.
Combined with a recent report of the detection of QPOs around the peaks of long
outbursts of a dwarf nova, we suspect that such QPOs during long outbursts may
have been excited when the accretion disk reaches the maximum radius, the tidal
truncation radius as being a possibility.

flexible electronics for its high electrical conductivity, intrinsic
deformability and biocompatibility. A series of flexible devices are developed
based on the micro-particles of liquid metal. But it is still challenging to
fabricate conformal liquid metal film with a large area and high uniformity.
Interfacial self-assembly is a competitive candidate method. Traditional
interfacial self-assembly methods have difficulties assembling liquid metal
particles because the floating state of the high-density microparticles could
be easily disturbed by gravity. Here, we realized the multi-size universal
self-assembly (MUS) for liquid metal particles with various diameters
(0~500{\mu}m). By introducing a simple z-axis undisturbed interfacial material
releasing strategy, the interference of gravitational energy on the stability
of floating particles is avoided. Benefits from this, the ultra-conformable
monolayer film, with large area (>100 cm2) and high floating yield (50%~90%),
can be fabricated by liquid metal particles. Furthermore, the monolayer can be
conformally transferred to any interesting complex surface such as human skin

blades and aircraft wings causing early boundary layer transition resulting in
a reduction of the lift-to-drag ratio/power production. Despite being a
recurring theme in engineering scenarios, the mechanism of boundary layer
transition caused by distributed roughness is not well understood, and
consequently, methods for mitigating its effects are scarce. In this work, we
present a passive method for delaying boundary layer transition caused by
distributed roughness (sandpaper strip) using a combination of secondary fine
roughness strips placed immediately upstream and downstream of the distributed
roughness. Hot-wire and PIV measurements are used to characterize the flow
features and quantify transition delay. A combination of secondary roughness
strips placed both upstream and downstream is shown to be most effective in
delaying transition caused by the primary distributed roughness. Results
suggest that the upstream roughness lifts the boundary layer reducing the
effective Reynolds number of the primary roughness, while the downstream
roughness reduces the strength of vortices shed from the primary roughness. A
parametric study on the length and type of secondary roughness shows that
smooth strips can also delay the transition and there is likely an optimal
length of the secondary roughness beyond which increasing the extent of the
downstream roughness has marginal effects on transition delay. Finally, after
the onset of transition, there are no specific signatures in the flow
corresponding to the secondary roughness which suggests that the secondary
roughness can delay transition without substantially altering the transitional
flow features. The results point to an adaptable and practical method for
increasing the life cycle and efficiency of aerodynamic surfaces with
distributed roughness.

a variety of approaches. In particular, reconstruction-based unsupervised

often susceptible to outliers and do not effectively model anomalies, leading
to suboptimal results. This paper presents a novel approach for unsupervised
anomaly detection, called the Cooperative Network Time Series (CNTS) approach.
The CNTS system consists of two components: a detector and a reconstructor. The
detector is responsible for directly detecting anomalies, while the
reconstructor provides reconstruction information to the detector and updates
its learning based on anomalous information received from the detector. The
central aspect of CNTS is a multi-objective optimization problem, which is
solved through a cooperative solution strategy. Experiments on three real-world

supernovae were thought to be the dominant source of the Ca production seen in
all stars. Here we report on a qualitatively different path to Ca production
through break-out from the ""warm"" carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. We extend
direct measurement of the $^{19}$F($p$, $\gamma$)$^{20}$Ne break-out reaction
down to an unprecedentedly low energy point of 186 keV and discover a key
resonance at 225 keV. In the domain of astrophysical interest, at around 0.1
giga kelvin, this thermonuclear $^{19}$F($p$,$\gamma$)$^{20}$Ne rate is up to a
factor of 7.4 larger than the previous recommended rate. Our stellar models
show a stronger break-out during stellar hydrogen burning than thought before,
and may reveal the nature of Ca production in Pop III stars imprinted on the
oldest known ultra-iron poor star, SMSS0313-6708. This result from the China
Jinping Underground Laboratory, the deepest laboratory in the world, offering
an environment with extremely low cosmic-ray induced background, has
far-reaching implications on our understanding of how the first stars evolve
and die. Our rate showcases the impact that faint Pop III star supernovae can
have on the nucleosynthesis observed in the oldest known stars and first
galaxies, key mission targets of the James Webb Space Telescope.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that electron transmission through chiral

chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this study, we show that CISS can be
observed in achiral systems driven by an external circularly polarized laser
field in the framework of Floquet engineering. By using the Floquet theory for
a time-periodically driven system to investigate spin-dependent electron

can approach unity if the light intensity is sufficiently strong, the rate of
dephasing is sufficiently small, and the average chemical potential of the two
leads is within an appropriate range of values, which is narrow because of the
high frequency of the laser field. To obtain a wider range of energies for
large spin polarization, a combination of chiral molecules and light-matter
interactions is considered and the spin polarization of electrons transported
through a helical molecule driven by a laser field is evaluated.

approximation ability, deep neural networks have been attractive to data-driven
flow and heat field reconstruction studies. However, limited by network
structure, existing researches mostly learn the reconstruction mapping in
finite-dimensional space and has poor transferability to variable resolution of
outputs. In this paper, we extend the new paradigm of neural operator and
propose an end-to-end physical field reconstruction method with both excellent
performance and mesh transferability named RecFNO. The proposed method aims to
learn the mapping from sparse observations to flow and heat field in
infinite-dimensional space, contributing to a more powerful nonlinear fitting
capacity and resolution-invariant characteristic. Firstly, according to
different usage scenarios, we develop three types of embeddings to model the
sparse observation inputs: MLP, mask, and Voronoi embedding. The MLP embedding
is propitious to more sparse input, while the others benefit from spatial
information preservation and perform better with the increase of observation
data. Then, we adopt stacked Fourier layers to reconstruct physical field in
Fourier space that regularizes the overall recovered field by Fourier modes
superposition. Benefiting from the operator in infinite-dimensional space, the
proposed method obtains remarkable accuracy and better resolution
transferability among meshes. The experiments conducted on fluid mechanics and
thermology problems show that the proposed method outperforms existing
POD-based and CNN-based methods in most cases and has the capacity to achieve
zero-shot super-resolution.

already been sheltered by several privacy-preserving laws in many countries.
However, with the development of data science, machine learning and deep
learning techniques, this right is usually neglected or violated as more and
more patients' data are being collected and used for model training, especially
in intelligent healthcare, thus making intelligent healthcare a sector where
technology must meet the law, regulations, and privacy principles to ensure
that the innovation is for the common good. In order to secure patients' right
to be forgotten, we proposed a novel solution by using auditing to guide the
forgetting process, where auditing means determining whether a dataset has been

which can reconstruct training data from public models. Indeed, MI attacks can
be formalized as an optimization problem that seeks private data in a certain
space. Recent MI attacks leverage a generative adversarial network (GAN) as an
image prior to narrow the search space, and can successfully reconstruct even
the high-dimensional data (e.g., face images). However, these generative MI
attacks do not fully exploit the potential capabilities of the target model,
still leading to a vague and coupled search space, i.e., different classes of
images are coupled in the search space. Besides, the widely used cross-entropy
loss in these attacks suffers from gradient vanishing. To address these
problems, we propose Pseudo Label-Guided MI (PLG-MI) attack via conditional GAN
(cGAN). At first, a top-n selection strategy is proposed to provide
pseudo-labels for public data, and use pseudo-labels to guide the training of
the cGAN. In this way, the search space is decoupled for different classes of
images. Then a max-margin loss is introduced to improve the search process on
the subspace of a target class. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PLG-MI attack significantly improves the attack success rate and visual quality
for various datasets and models, notably, 2~3 $\times$ better than
state-of-the-art attacks under large distributional shifts. Our code is

Specifically, we establish the first general high-probability generalization

analysis. Finally, our results are applied to triplet metric learning to
characterize its theoretical underpinning.

  For any given finite alphabet, we give codes that can correct absorption

apply binary (multiple-) deletion correcting codes. For single-absorption
error, we prove that the Varshamov-Tenengolts codes can provide a near-optimal

discrete-time dynamical systems over the infinite time horizon. The
reachability verification of interest in this paper is to certify specified
lower and upper bounds of the reachability probability, with which the system
starting from a designated initial set will enter a desired target set
eventually. Existing sufficient conditions for reachability verification over
the infinite time horizon are established based on the Doob's
non-supermartingle inequality, which are often restrictive. Recently, a set of
equations was proposed in [18], to which the solution is able to characterize
the exact reachability probability. Inspired by this result, we in this paper
propose sufficient conditions for reachability verification based on relaxing
this equation. These sufficient conditions are shown to be weaker than the
state-of-the-art ones, consequently being capable of providing more
opportunities for verifying the reachability property successfully.

Computing paradigms, centralized Machine and Deep Learning (ML/DL) have become
challenging due to existing distributed data silos containing sensitive
information. The rising concern for data privacy is promoting the development
of collaborative and privacy-preserving ML/DL techniques such as Federated
Learning (FL). FL enables data privacy by design since the local data of
participants are not exposed during the creation of the global and
collaborative model. However, data privacy and performance are no longer
sufficient, and there is a real necessity to trust model predictions. The
literature has proposed some works on trustworthy ML/DL (without data privacy),
where robustness, fairness, explainability, and accountability are identified
as relevant pillars. However, more efforts are needed to identify
trustworthiness pillars and evaluation metrics relevant to FL models and to
create solutions computing the trustworthiness level of FL models. Thus, this
work analyzes the existing requirements for trustworthiness evaluation in FL
and proposes a comprehensive taxonomy of six pillars (privacy, robustness,
fairness, explainability, accountability, and federation) with notions and more
than 30 metrics for computing the trustworthiness of FL models. Then, an
algorithm called FederatedTrust has been designed according to the pillars and
metrics identified in the previous taxonomy to compute the trustworthiness
score of FL models. A prototype of FederatedTrust has been implemented and
deployed into the learning process of FederatedScope, a well-known FL
framework. Finally, four experiments performed with different configurations of
FederatedScope using the FEMNIST dataset under different federation
configurations demonstrated the usefulness of FederatedTrust when computing the
trustworthiness of FL models.

supported by recently measured $(\alpha,\gamma)$ and $(\alpha,n)$

advances such as software defined radio (SDR), this task becomes increasingly
difficult. It is important for sensing devices to keep up with this change, to
ensure optimal spectrum usage, to monitor traffic over-the-air for security
concerns, and for identifying devices in electronic warfare. Machine learning
object detection has shown to be effective for spectrum sensing, however
current techniques can be slow and use excessive resources. FRCNN has been
applied to perform spectrum sensing using 2D spectrograms, however is unable to
be applied directly to 1D signals. We optimize FRCNN to handle 1D signals,

capacity to self-evaluate and repent on their actions. While reparative
measures, such as apologies, are often considered as possible strategic
interactions, the explicit evolution of the emotion of guilt as a behavioural
phenotype is not yet well understood. Here, we study the co-evolution of social
and non-social guilt of homogeneous or heterogeneous populations, including
well-mixed, lattice and scale-free networks. Socially aware guilt comes at a
cost, as it requires agents to make demanding efforts to observe and understand
the internal state and behaviour of others, while non-social guilt only
requires the awareness of the agents' own state and hence incurs no social
cost. Those choosing to be non-social are however more sensitive to
exploitation by other agents due to their social unawareness. Resorting to
methods from evolutionary game theory, we study analytically, and through
extensive numerical and agent-based simulations, whether and how such social
and non-social guilt can evolve and deploy, depending on the underlying
structure of the populations, or systems, of agents. The results show that, in
both lattice and scale-free networks, emotional guilt prone strategies are
dominant for a larger range of the guilt and social costs incurred, compared to
the well-mixed population setting, leading therefore to significantly higher
levels of cooperation for a wider range of the costs. In structured population
settings, both social and non-social guilt can evolve and deploy through
clustering with emotional prone strategies, allowing them to be protected from
exploiters, especially in case of non-social (less costly) strategies. Overall,
our findings provide important insights into the design and engineering of
self-organised and distributed cooperative multi-agent systems.

astronomy has emerged as a rapidly advancing field that holds great potential
for studying the cosmos, from probing the properties of black holes to testing
the limits of our current understanding of gravity. One important aspect of
gravitational-wave astronomy is the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, where
massive intervening objects can bend and magnify gravitational waves, providing
a unique way to probe the distribution of matter in the universe, as well as
finding applications to fundamental physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.
However, current models for gravitational-wave millilensing - a specific form
of lensing where small-scale astrophysical objects can split a gravitational
wave signal into multiple copies - are often limited to simple isolated lenses,
which is not realistic for complex lensing scenarios. In this paper, we present
a novel phenomenological approach to incorporate millilensing in data analysis
in a model-independent fashion. Our approach enables the recovery of arbitrary
lens configurations without the need for extensive computational lens modeling,
making it a more accurate and computationally efficient tool for studying the
distribution of matter in the universe using gravitational-wave signals. When
gravitational-wave lensing observations become possible, our method can provide
a powerful tool for studying complex lens configurations, including dark matter
subhalos and MACHOs.

that the categories of 3D objects cannot change over time in the real-world.
This unrealistic assumption may result in significant performance degradation
for them to learn new classes of 3D objects consecutively, due to the
catastrophic forgetting on old learned classes. Moreover, they cannot explore
which 3D geometric characteristics are essential to alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting on old classes of 3D objects. To tackle the above challenges, we
develop a novel Incremental 3D Object Recognition Network (i.e., InOR-Net),
which could recognize new classes of 3D objects continuously via overcoming the
catastrophic forgetting on old classes. Specifically, a category-guided
geometric reasoning is proposed to reason local geometric structures with
distinctive 3D characteristics of each class by leveraging intrinsic category
information. We then propose a novel critic-induced geometric attention
mechanism to distinguish which 3D geometric characteristics within each class
are beneficial to overcome the catastrophic forgetting on old classes of 3D
objects, while preventing the negative influence of useless 3D characteristics.
In addition, a dual adaptive fairness compensations strategy is designed to
overcome the forgetting brought by class imbalance, by compensating biased

EC server sends back virtual information to enhance the human perception of the
world by merging it with the real environment. Resource allocation arises as a
critical challenge when several MAR Service Providers (SPs) compete for limited
resources at the edge of the network. In this paper, we consider EC in a
multi-tenant environment where the resource owner, i.e., the Network Operator
(NO), virtualizes the resources and lets SPs run their services using the
allocated slice of resources. Indeed, for MAR applications, we focus on two
specific resources: CPU and RAM, deployed in some edge node, e.g., a central
office. We study the decision of the NO about how to partition these resources
among several SPs. We model the arrival and service dynamics of users belonging
to different SPs using Erlang queuing model and show that under perfect
information, the interaction between the NO and SPs can be formulated as a
sub-modular maximization problem under multiple Knapsack constraints. To solve
the problem, we use an approximation algorithm, guaranteeing a bounded gap with

the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline proportional allocation in terms of
the number of sessions accommodated at the edge for each SP.

in which each instance is associated with a candidate label set, and among
which only one is true. However, the assumption that the ground-truth label is
always among the candidate label set would be unrealistic, as the reliability
of the candidate label sets in real-world applications cannot be guaranteed by

Learning (UPLL) is proposed, in which the true label may not be in the

previous PLL methods will experience a marked decline in performance when
applied to UPLL. To address the issue, we propose a two-stage framework named
Unreliable Partial Label Learning with Recursive Separation (UPLLRS). In the
first stage, the self-adaptive recursive separation strategy is proposed to
separate the training set into a reliable subset and an unreliable subset. In
the second stage, a disambiguation strategy is employed to progressively
identify the ground-truth labels in the reliable subset. Simultaneously,
semi-supervised learning methods are adopted to extract valuable information
from the unreliable subset. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art

  Alignment","14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Compared to 2D images, 3D point clouds are much more sensitive to rotations.
We expect the point features describing certain patterns to keep invariant to
the rotation transformation. There are many recent SOTA works dedicated to
rotation-invariant learning for 3D point clouds. However, current
rotation-invariant methods lack generalizability on the point clouds in the
open scenes due to the reliance on the global distribution, \ie the global
scene and backgrounds. Considering that the output activation is a function of
the pattern and its orientation, we need to eliminate the effect of the
orientation.In this paper, inspired by the idea that the network weights can be
considered a set of points distributed in the same 3D space as the input
points, we propose Weight-Feature Alignment (WFA) to construct a local
Invariant Reference Frame (IRF) via aligning the features with the principal
axes of the network weights. Our WFA algorithm provides a general solution for
the point clouds of all scenes. WFA ensures the model achieves the target that
the response activity is a necessary and sufficient condition of the pattern
matching degree. Practically, we perform experiments on the point clouds of
both single objects and open large-range scenes. The results suggest that our
method almost bridges the gap between rotation invariance learning and normal
methods.

symmetry sectors. Here, we consider bosons in a Kagome lattice with $\pi$-flux
hopping, which in the presence of mean-field interactions exhibit degenerate
condensates in the $\Gamma$- and the $K$-point. We analyze the excitation above
both condensates and find strikingly different properties: For the $K$-point
condensate, the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian has broken particle-hole
symmetry (PHS) and exhibits a topologically trivial quasiparticle band
structure. However, band flatness plays a key role in breaking the time
reversal symmetry (TRS) of the BdG Hamiltonian for a $\Gamma$-point condensate.
Consequently, its quasiparticle band structure exhibits non-trivial topology,
characterized by non-zero Chern numbers and the presence of edge states.
Although quantum fluctuations energetically favor the $K$-point condensate, the
interesting properties of the $\Gamma$-point condensate become relevant for
anisotropic hopping. The topological properties of the $\Gamma$-point
condensate get even richer in the presence of extended Bose-Hubbard
interactions. We find a topological phase transition into a topological
condensate characterized by high Chern number and also comment on the
realization and detection of such excitations.

for federated learning that is protected against Byzantine attacks and privacy
leakages. Processing individual updates to manage adversarial behavior, while
preserving privacy of data against colluding nodes, requires some sort of
secure secret sharing. However, the communication load for secret sharing of
long vectors of updates can be very high. ByzSecAgg solves this problem by
partitioning local updates into smaller sub-vectors and sharing them using ramp
secret sharing. However, this sharing method does not admit bi-linear
computations, such as pairwise distance calculations, needed by
outlier-detection algorithms. To overcome this issue, each user runs another
round of ramp sharing, with different embedding of data in the sharing
polynomial. This technique, motivated by ideas from coded computing, enables
secure computation of pairwise distance. In addition, to maintain the integrity
and privacy of the local update, ByzSecAgg also uses a vector commitment
method, in which the commitment size remains constant (i.e. does not increase
with the length of the local update), while simultaneously allowing
verification of the secret sharing process. In terms of communication loads,
ByzSecAgg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art scheme, known as BREA.

devoted to the vision of zero waste and zero emissions, and at the same time,
fulfilling the broad commitment on inclusive green economy within the climate
action. To set the groundwork for a smart city solution which achieves this
vision, main indicators and evaluation frameworks are introduced, followed by
the drill down into most crucial problems, both globally and locally, in a case
study in north Italy. Methane is on the rise in the climate agenda, and
specifically in Italy emission mitigation is difficult to achieve in the
farming sector. Accordingly, going from the generic frameworks towards a
federation deployment, we provide the reasoning for a cost-effective use case
in the domain of food, to create a valuable digital twin. A Bayesian approach
to assess use cases and select preferred scenarios is proposed, realizing the
potential of the digital twin flexibility with FAIR data, while understanding

degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) cores with masses near the Chandrasekhar limit,
explosive oxygen burning can be triggered due to the ignition of central

  Lee","An ASR-free Fluency Scoring Approach with Self-Supervised Learning","Accepted by ICASSP 2023",,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A typical fluency scoring system generally relies on an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system to obtain time stamps in input speech for either the
subsequent calculation of fluency-related features or directly modeling speech
fluency with an end-to-end approach. This paper describes a novel ASR-free
approach for automatic fluency assessment using self-supervised learning (SSL).
Specifically, wav2vec2.0 is used to extract frame-level speech features,
followed by K-means clustering to assign a pseudo label (cluster index) to each
frame. A BLSTM-based model is trained to predict an utterance-level fluency
score from frame-level SSL features and the corresponding cluster indexes.
Neither speech transcription nor time stamp information is required in the
proposed system. It is ASR-free and can potentially avoid the ASR errors effect
in practice. Experimental results carried out on non-native English databases
show that the proposed approach significantly improves the performance in the
""open response"" scenario as compared to previous methods and matches the
recently reported performance in the ""read aloud"" scenario.

conductors with a predominant intrinsic dipolar magnetic field anchored to
their stellar crust. If compact enough, General Relativity modifies Maxwell's
equations, leading to changes in the interior and exterior electromagnetic
solutions. We present analytic solutions for a slowly-rotating magnetized
neutron star that include the frame-dragging correction to the magnetic field
components. For typical compactness values, i.e. $R_s \sim 0.5 [R_*]$, we show
that the new terms account for a $0.43\%$ decrease in magnetic field strength
at the equator and an average $1\%$ vectorial angle correction, both compared
to the case without the magnetic frame-dragging correction. This correction
leads to a self-consistent redistribution of the surface azimuthal current. We
tested the validity of the derived solution by prescribing it as an initial
value problem to two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. We observe a
lower early-stage transient amplitude which reflects the proximity between the
derived and exact solutions. At later times, our solution reduces the azimuthal
electric field amplitude by almost an order of magnitude, demonstrating that
simulations are more accurate at the expense of a more involved initialization.
We show that this can potentially lead to a reduction of simulation runtimes.

(SWCNTs), high growth temperatures are preferred, while the formation of
impurity amorphous carbon (a-C) causes the termination of SWCNT growth and
degrades its properties. To remove this by-product, H2O and CO2 have been
employed in metal-catalyzed SWCNT growth systems because of their oxidizing
ability. Recently, nonmetallic nanoparticles have become one of the growth seed
candidates because of their high melting points and fewer metal impurities. In
this study, by using nanodiamond-derived carbon nanoparticles as the solid
growth seeds, we investigated the effect of CO2 and H2O on high-temperature
SWCNT growth with two types of carbon-source supplies: C2H2 and C2H4. In this
growth system, H2O showed oxidizing ability to etch a-C with either carbon
sources. CO2 exhibited a similar a-C formation-preventing role in C2H4-supplied
growth and achieved higher-purity SWCNTs with higher concentration of C2H4 than
the case of H2O. However, in contrast to the other combinations, CO2 injection
in the C2H2-supplied growth significantly enhanced the formation of a-C rather
than the removal of it while the yield of SWCNTs was also increased, indicating
the occurrence of the dehydration reaction between CO2 and C2H2. The present
findings will lead to efficient growth of high-quality SWCNTs from nonmetallic
growth seeds with the use of growth enhancers.

illustrated, using quasi-static processes in model experiments. However when
decreasing the duration of operations, an energy overhead proportional to the

a huge step towards efficient information processing. We show that underdamped
systems are the winning strategy to reduce this energetic cost. We prove both
experimentally and theoretically that, in the limit of vanishing dissipation
mechanisms in the memory, the physical system is thermally insulated from its
environment during fast erasures, i.e. fast protocols are adiabatic as no heat

To achieve fairness, mechanisms often rely on a central authority, which may
act inefficiently in times of need when swiftness and good organization are
crucial. In this work, we study a hybrid trading system called Crisdis,
introduced by Jedli\v{c}kov\'{a} et al., which combines fair allocation of
buying rights with a market - leveraging the best of both worlds. A frustration
of a buyer in Crisdis is defined as a difference between the amount of goods
they are entitled to according to the assigned buying rights and the amount of
goods they are able to acquire by trading. We define a Price of Anarchy (PoA)

context of frustration. Our main contribution is a study of PoA in realistic
complex double-sided market mechanisms for Crisdis. The performed empirical
analysis suggests that in contrast to market free of governmental

mining the user's interests is still a significant challenge. Existing works
predict the user interest by utilizing user behaviors, i.e., clicks, views,

both these user-types as ""cold users"", which are very common but often

friendship, following bloggers, interest groups, etc., with the activity

which adopts a two-stage method to progressively extract the coarse-grained and
fine-grained social interest. Our technique then concatenates SocialNet's

with experiments and direct numerical simulations to investigate the optimal

predicted over wide ranges of flow reduced velocities and structural damping
ratios, and the maximum efficiency and optimal settings of damping ratio and
reduced velocity were then examined for different mass ratios and Reynolds
numbers. Efficiencies predicted by the ROM were also validated against either
experiments or direct simulations. The present work indicates that: (i) the
maximum efficiency is controlled by both the incoming reduced velocity and the
product of mass ratio and structural damping ratio, which is similar to the
maximum amplitude of VIV; (ii) the maximum efficiency at a relatively high
Reynolds number ($Re \approx 6 \times 10^3$) in subcritical regime is higher
than that of a low Reynolds number ($Re = 150$) in laminar regime; (iii) the
energy harvesting efficiency from VIV of a circular cylinder with a low mass

that the VIV harvester performs better in water than in air.

  Quality Predictions",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Air quality prediction is a typical spatio-temporal modeling problem, which
always uses different components to handle spatial and temporal dependencies in
complex systems separately. Previous models based on time series analysis and
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods have only modeled time series while
ignoring spatial information. Previous GCNs-based methods usually require
providing spatial correlation graph structure of observation sites in advance.
The correlations among these sites and their strengths are usually calculated
using prior information. However, due to the limitations of human cognition,
limited prior information cannot reflect the real station-related structure or
bring more effective information for accurate prediction. To this end, we
propose a novel Dynamic Graph Neural Network with Adaptive Edge Attributes
(DGN-AEA) on the message passing network, which generates the adaptive
bidirected dynamic graph by learning the edge attributes as model parameters.
Unlike prior information to establish edges, our method can obtain adaptive
edge information through end-to-end training without any prior information.
Thus reduced the complexity of the problem. Besides, the hidden structural
information between the stations can be obtained as model by-products, which
can help make some subsequent decision-making analyses. Experimental results
show that our model received state-of-the-art performance than other baselines.

high practical interest to several engineering fields. In this work we develop
a non-intrusive, reduced-order modelling methodology for two-dimensional (2D)
VIV simulations. We consider an elliptical, non-deformable solid mounted on
springs, subject to a laminar, incompressible flow. Approximating the Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) formulation, a
discrete-time, quadratic-bilinear data-driven model structure is assigned for
the velocity flowfield prediction. The full-order, data-driven model operators
have a predefined sparsity pattern, following the adjacency-based sparsity of
the discretized ALE-NS operators. Thus, the data-driven operators inference
requires solving many low-dimensional least squares problems, isolating the
contribution of ""nearest neighbours"" for each degree of freedom. Numerical
aspects such as data centering and regularization are extensively discussed.
With this approach, Dirichlet boundary conditions at the inlet and the
fluid/solid interface can be enforced on the full-order, non-intrusive level.
Consequently, a non-intrusive reduced-order model (ROM) for the velocity
flowfield is obtained after linear projection. The resulting ROM is coupled
with the first-principle, 2D solid oscillation equations and is simulated using
an implicit time integration scheme. The coupled solution is then mapped on the
deformed grid through the inverse ALE map. This methodology is showcased for
two testcases, at different Reynolds numbers (Re = 90, 180). Numerical results
indicate a successful coupling between the data-driven velocity flowfield and
the solid oscillation, with prediction errors of less than 3% for both the
flowfield and the solid oscillation. A comparative study with respect to the
ROM dimension indicates the robustness and potential of the approach.

found that the steady-state value of the CLS increases monotonically with
respect to the static disorder, which suggests that the amplitude of the static
disorder can be determined using the CLS in the long-time limit. Additionally,
as the static disorder rises, the decay rate of the CLS first decreases to a
certain value and remains at this value until the static disorder is
sufficiently large. Afterward, the CLS begins to fluctuate significantly and
thus results in obtaining the decay rate through the CLS method unreliable.
Based on these discoveries, we propose a method to fix the error and obtain the
TCF. Our findings may pave the way for obtaining reliable system-bath
information by analyzing 2DES in the practical situations.

as dust and scratches. Automated removal of these is an important part of
preservation and dissemination of photographs of historical and cultural
importance.
  While state-of-the-art deep learning models have shown impressive results in
general image inpainting and denoising, film artefact removal is an
understudied problem. It has particularly challenging requirements, due to the
complex nature of analogue damage, the high resolution of film scans, and
potential ambiguities in the restoration. There are no publicly available
high-quality datasets of real-world analogue film damage for training and
evaluation, making quantitative studies impossible.
  We address the lack of ground-truth data for evaluation by collecting a
dataset of 4K damaged analogue film scans paired with manually-restored
versions produced by a human expert, allowing quantitative evaluation of
restoration performance. We construct a larger synthetic dataset of damaged
images with paired clean versions using a statistical model of artefact shape
and occurrence learnt from real, heavily-damaged images. We carefully validate
the realism of the simulated damage via a human perceptual study, showing that
even expert users find our synthetic damage indistinguishable from real. In
addition, we demonstrate that training with our synthetically damaged dataset
leads to improved artefact segmentation performance when compared to previously
proposed synthetic analogue damage.
  Finally, we use these datasets to train and analyse the performance of eight
state-of-the-art image restoration methods on high-resolution scans. We compare
both methods which directly perform the restoration task on scans with
artefacts, and methods which require a damage mask to be provided for the
inpainting of artefacts.

violation, software theft, code search, and the detection of malicious
components. There is now a good number of open source and proprietary clone
detectors for programs written in traditional programming languages. However,
the increasing adoption of deep learning models in software poses a challenge
to these tools: these models implement functions that are inscrutable black
boxes. As more software includes these DNN functions, new techniques are needed
in order to assess the similarity between deep learning components of software.
Previous work has unveiled techniques for comparing the representations learned
at various layers of deep neural network models by feeding canonical inputs to
the models. Our goal is to be able to compare DNN functions when canonical
inputs are not available -- because they may not be in many application
scenarios. The challenge, then, is to generate appropriate inputs and to
identify a metric that, for those inputs, is capable of representing the degree
of functional similarity between two comparable DNN functions.
  Our approach uses random input with values between -1 and 1, in a shape that
is compatible with what the DNN models expect. We then compare the outputs by
performing correlation analysis. Our study shows how it is possible to perform
similarity analysis even in the absence of meaningful canonical inputs. The
response to random inputs of two comparable DNN functions exposes those
functions' similarity, or lack thereof. Of all the metrics tried, we find that
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is the most powerful and versatile,
although in special cases other methods and metrics are more expressive. We
present a systematic empirical study comparing the effectiveness of several
similarity metrics using a dataset of 56,355 classifiers collected from GitHub.
This is accompanied by a sensitivity analysis that reveals how certain models'
training related properties affect the effectiveness of the similarity metrics.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how
similarity of DNN functions can be detected by using random inputs. Our study
of correlation metrics, and the identification of Spearman correlation
coefficient as the most powerful among them for this purpose, establishes a
complete and practical method for DNN clone detection that can be used in the
design of new tools. It may also serve as inspiration for other program
analysis tasks whose approaches break in the presence of DNN components.

  Issue 3, Article 10","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2023/7/10",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Stream API was added in Java 8 to allow the declarative expression of
data-processing logic, typically map-reduce-like data transformations on
collections and datasets. The Stream API introduces two key abstractions. The
stream, which is a sequence of elements available in a data source, and the
stream pipeline, which contains operations (e.g., map, filter, reduce) that are
applied to the elements in the stream upon execution. Streams are getting
popular among Java developers as they leverage the conciseness of functional
programming and ease the parallelization of data processing.
  Despite the benefits of streams, in comparison to data processing relying on
imperative code, streams can introduce significant overheads which are mainly
caused by extra object allocations and reclamations, and the use of virtual
method calls. As a result, developers need means to study the runtime behavior
of streams in the goal of both mitigating such abstraction overheads and
optimizing stream processing. Unfortunately, there is a lack of dedicated tools
able to dynamically analyze streams to help developers specifically locate
issues degrading application performance.
  In this paper, we address the profiling and optimization of streams. We
present a novel profiling technique for measuring the computations performed by
a stream in terms of elapsed reference cycles, which we use to locate
problematic streams with a major impact on application performance. While
accuracy is crucial to this end, the inserted instrumentation code causes the
execution of extra cycles, which are partially included in the profiles. To
mitigate this issue, we estimate and compensate for the extra cycles caused by
the inserted instrumentation code.
  We implement our approach in StreamProf that, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first dedicated stream profiler for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). With
StreamProf, we find that cycle profiling is effective to detect problematic
streams whose optimization can enable significant performance gains. We also
find that the accurate profiling of tasks supporting parallel stream processing
allows the diagnosis of load imbalance according to the distribution of
stream-related cycles at a thread level.
  We conduct an evaluation on sequential and parallel stream-based workloads
that are publicly available in three different sources. The evaluation shows
that our profiling technique is efficient and yields accurate profiles.
Moreover, we show the actionability of our profiles by guiding stream-related
optimizations on two workloads from Renaissance. Our optimizations require the
modification of only a few lines of code while achieving speedups up to a
factor of 5x.
  Java streams have been extensively studied by recent work, focusing on both
how developers are using streams and how to optimize them. Current approaches
in the optimization of streams mainly rely on static analysis techniques that
overlook runtime information, suffer from important limitations to detect all
streams executed by a Java application, or are not suitable for the analysis of
parallel streams. Understanding the dynamic behavior of both sequential and

can be used in downstream tasks such as those related to on-board perception
for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) or driver assistance. Therefore, a relevant
arising question is whether the standard metrics for MDE assessment are a good
indicator of the accuracy of future MDE-based driving-related perception tasks.
We address this question in this paper. In particular, we take the task of 3D
object detection on point clouds as a proxy of on-board perception. We train
and test state-of-the-art 3D object detectors using 3D point clouds coming from
MDE models. We confront the ranking of object detection results with the
ranking given by the depth estimation metrics of the MDE models. We conclude
that, indeed, MDE evaluation metrics give rise to a ranking of methods that
reflects relatively well the 3D object detection results we may expect. Among
the different metrics, the absolute relative (abs-rel) error seems to be the
best for that purpose.

$\mathrm{0.665\pm0.025\,M_J}$ and a radius of $\mathrm{1.017\pm0.044\,R_J}$. It
orbits close to its host star, with an orbital period of $\mathrm{2.5926\,d}$,
but has an equilibrium temperature of $\mathrm{\approx 604 \, K}$, well below
the expected threshold for radius inflation of hot Jupiters. The host star has
a mass of $\mathrm{0.3939\pm0.0030\,M_\odot}$, a radius of

formation models do not predict the existence of gas giants such as TOI-3235 b
around such low-mass stars. With a high transmission spectroscopy metric,
TOI-3235 b is one of the best-suited giants orbiting M-dwarfs for atmospheric

been shown to be topological in such systems. Some of their properties are,
however, quite different from the two-dimensional case. On the Sierpinski
triangle, for instance, the entanglement entropy shows oscillations as a
function of particle number and does not obey the area law despite being
topologically ordered, and the particle density is non-uniform in the bulk.
Here, we investigate these deviant properties in greater detail on the
Sierpinski triangle, and we also study the properties on the Sierpinski carpet
and the T-fractal. We find that the density variations across the fractal are
present for all the considered fractal lattices and for most choices of the
number of particles. The size of anyons inserted into the lattice Laughlin
state also varies with position on the fractal lattice. We observe that
quasiholes and quasiparticles have similar sizes and that the size of the
anyons typically increases with decreasing Hausdorff dimension. As opposed to
periodic lattices in two dimensions, the Sierpinski triangle and carpet have
inner edges. We construct trial states for both inner and outer edge states. We
find that oscillations of the entropy as a function of particle number are
present for the T-fractal, but not for the Sierpinski carpet. Finally, we
observe deviations from the area law for several different bipartitions on the
Sierpinski triangle.

Universe, the most massive galaxies are the key to our understanding of the

details of their formation histories remain uncertain. We address these
problems by planning a large survey sample of ultramassive galaxies ($z\le0.3$,
$|\delta+24^{\circ}|<45$\deg, $|b|>8$\deg), including 76\% E, 17\% S0, and 7\%
S brighter than $M_K\le-27$ mag (stellar mass
$2\times10^{12}<M_\star<5\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) with the HARMONI instrument
on ELT. We thus describe our most massive galaxies survey, discuss the distinct
demographics and environmental properties of the selected galaxies, and
simulate their HARMONI $I_z$, $I_z+J$, and $H+K$-band IFS observations via
combining the inferred stellar-mass models from the images of Pan-STARRS
observations, a synthetic spectrum of the assumed stellar population, and an
SMBH with a specific mass estimated based on different black hole scaling
relations. We find HARMONI can produce excellent state-of-art IFS datacubes
even for targets beyond the limits of the current suite of 8m class
ground-based telescopes with adaptive optic assisted like Gemini and VLT in a
relatively short exposure time. We extract the stellar kinematics from the
simulated IFU data using the stellar-absorption CaT and some stellar features
in ($I_z$, $I_z+J$) and $H+K$ band, respectively; then used them to reconstruct
the SMBH mass and its error using MCMC simulation. The simulated stellar
kinematics were achieved with a median random noise of $\Delta V_{\rm

reported that in frontends using learnable filterbanks initialised to a mel

initialisation. Using a Gabor-based filterbank, we investigate the sensitivity
of a learnable filterbank to its initialisation using several initialisation
strategies on two audio tasks: voice activity detection and bird species
identification. We use the Jensen-Shannon Distance and analysis of the learned
filters before and after training. We show that although performance is overall
improved, the filterbanks exhibit strong sensitivity to their initialisation
strategy. The limited movement from initialised values suggests that alternate
optimisation strategies may allow a learnable frontend to reach better overall
performance.

reticulation events. Although the comparison of phylogenetic trees is well
studied, and there are multiple ways to do it in an efficient way, the
situation is much different for phylogenetic networks.
  Some classes of phylogenetic networks, mainly tree-child networks, are known
to be classified efficiently by their $\mu$-representation, which essentially
counts, for every node, the number of paths to each leaf. In this paper, we
introduce the extended $\mu$-representation of networks, where the number of
paths to reticulations is also taken into account. This modification allows us
to distinguish orchard networks and to define a sound metric on the space of
such networks that can, moreover, be computed efficiently.
  The class of orchard networks, as well as being one of the classes with
biological significance (one such network can be interpreted as a tree with
extra arcs involving coexisting organisms), is one of the most generic ones (in
mathematical terms) for which such a representation can (conjecturally) exist,
since a slight relaxation of the definition leads to a problem that is Graph
Isomorphism Complete.

Classification models are often extended to a different topic and/or time

and when it is worth re-training our model is difficult. This paper compares
different approaches to fine-tune a BERT model for a long-running

boost the classification quality. Our corpus contains over 8 million comments

comments to fine-tune a model. It is not advisable to focus only on comments
containing words that our model has not encountered before; a more efficient
solution is randomly sample comments from the new period. Fine-tuning does not
prevent the model from losing performance but merely slows it down. In a
rapidly changing linguistic environment, it is not possible to maintain model
performance without regularly annotating new text.

We investigate the use of unsupervised learning algorithms for classifying the

presence of significant interstellar dust, the spectra separate into two groups
attributable to O-rich and C-rich sources. Given these classifications, we
utilise a supervised approach to separate O-rich and C-rich sources without
BP/RP spectra but instead given broadband optical and infrared photometry
finding a purity of our C-rich classifications of around $95$ per cent. We test
and validate the classifications against other advocated colour-colour

BP/RP spectra for finding S-type stars or those possibly symbiotic sources with
strong emission lines. Although our classification suggests the Galactic
bar-bulge is host to very few C-rich long-period variable stars, we do find a
small fraction of C-rich stars with periods $>250\,\mathrm{day}$ that are
spatially and kinematically consistent with bar-bulge membership. We argue the
combination of the observed number, the spatial alignment, the kinematics and
the period distribution disfavour young metal-poor star formation scenarios
either in situ or in an accreted host, and instead, these stars are highly
likely to be the result of binary evolution and the evolved versions of blue
straggler stars already observed in the bar-bulge.

variable stars are related to their ages. This, together with their brightness
in the infrared, makes them powerful probes of the formation and evolution of
highly-extincted or distant parts of the Local Group. Here we utilise the Gaia
DR3 catalogue of long-period variable candidates to calibrate the period-age
relation of the Mira variables. Dynamical models are fitted to the O-rich Mira
variable population across the extended solar neighbourhood and then the
resulting solar neighbourhood period-kinematic relations are compared to
external calibrations of the age-kinematic relations to derive a Mira variable
period-age relation of
$\tau\approx(6.9\pm0.3)\,\mathrm{Gyr}(1+\tanh((330\,\mathrm{d}-P)/(400\pm90)\mathrm{d})$.
Our results compare well with previous calibrations using smaller datasets as
well as the period-age properties of Local Group cluster members. This
calibration opens the possibility of accurately characterising the star
formation and the impact of different evolutionary processes throughout the
Local Group.

signals such as images and audio, it remains elusive for diffusion models in
learning discrete sequence data like natural languages. Although recent
advances circumvent this challenge of discreteness by embedding discrete tokens
as continuous surrogates, they still fall short of satisfactory generation
quality. To understand this, we first dive deep into the denoised training
protocol of diffusion-based sequence generative models and determine their
three severe problems, i.e., 1) failing to learn, 2) lack of scalability, and
3) neglecting source conditions. We argue that these problems can be boiled
down to the pitfall of the not completely eliminated discreteness in the
embedding space, and the scale of noises is decisive herein. In this paper, we
introduce DINOISER to facilitate diffusion models for sequence generation by
manipulating noises. We propose to adaptively determine the range of sampled
noise scales for counter-discreteness training; and encourage the proposed
diffused sequence learner to leverage source conditions with amplified noise
scales during inference. Experiments show that DINOISER enables consistent
improvement over the baselines of previous diffusion-based sequence generative
models on several conditional sequence modeling benchmarks thanks to both
effective training and inference strategies. Analyses further verify that
DINOISER can make better use of source conditions to govern its generative
process.

successfully applied, except for a few deviations such as the W mass and the
g-2 of muons, where experiment is showing departures from what SM predicts. It
predicts further the existence of a hidden sector of particles which may
function as dark matter. In this paper, we first note that the above results
involve the FSM undergoing a vacuum transition at a scale of around 17 MeV,
where the vev's of the colour framons which are all nonzero above that scale
acquire some vanishing components below it. This implies that the metric
pertaining to these vanishing components would vanish also. Consequences should
then ensue, mostly in the unknown hidden sector where empirical confirmation is
hard at present to come by, but they give small reflections in the standard
sector, some of which may have already been seen. However, one notes that if
one imagines colour to be embedded, Kaluza-Klein fashion, into a higher
dimensional space-time, then this VTR1 would cause 2 of the compactified
dimensions to collapse. This might mean that when the universe cooled to the
corresponding temperature of $10^{11}$K when it was about $10^{-3}$s old, this
VTR1 collapse would cause the 3 spatial dimensions of the universe to expand to
compensate. The resultant expansion is estimated, using FSM parameters
previously determined from particle physics, to be capable, when extrapolated
backwards in time, of bringing the present universe back inside the then
horizon, solving thus formally the horizon problem. Besides, VTR1 being a
global phenomenon in the FSM, it would switch on and off automatically and
simultaneously over all space, thus requiring no additional strategy for a

(DRL). However, the cost is typically encoded as an indicator function due to
the difficulty of quantifying the risk of policy decisions in the state space.
Such an encoding requires the agent to visit numerous unsafe states to learn a
cost-value function to drive the learning process toward safety. Hence,
increasing the number of unsafe interactions and decreasing sample efficiency.
In this paper, we investigate an alternative approach that uses domain
knowledge to quantify the risk in the proximity of such states by defining a
violation metric. This metric is computed by verifying task-level properties,
shaped as input-output conditions, and it is used as a penalty to bias the
policy away from unsafe states without learning an additional value function.
We investigate the benefits of using the violation metric in standard Safe DRL
benchmarks and robotic mapless navigation tasks. The navigation experiments
bridge the gap between Safe DRL and robotics, introducing a framework that
allows rapid testing on real robots. Our experiments show that policies trained
with the violation penalty achieve higher performance over Safe DRL baselines

We prove the global convergence of randomly initialized gradient descent with a
$O\left(T^{-3}\right)$ rate. This is the first global convergence result for
this problem beyond the exact-parameterization setting ($n=1$) in which the
gradient descent enjoys an $\exp(-\Omega(T))$ rate. Perhaps surprisingly, we
further present an $\Omega\left(T^{-3}\right)$ lower bound for randomly
initialized gradient flow in the over-parameterization setting. These two
bounds jointly give an exact characterization of the convergence rate and
imply, for the first time, that over-parameterization can exponentially slow
down the convergence rate. To prove the global convergence, we need to tackle
the interactions among student neurons in the gradient descent dynamics, which
are not present in the exact-parameterization case. We use a three-phase
structure to analyze GD's dynamics. Along the way, we prove gradient descent
automatically balances student neurons, and use this property to deal with the
non-smoothness of the objective function. To prove the convergence rate lower
bound, we construct a novel potential function that characterizes the pairwise
distances between the student neurons (which cannot be done in the

cache can serve an arbitrary number of users, analyzing the case where there is
some knowledge about such number of users (i.e., the topology) during the
content placement phase. Under the assumption of regular placement and a
cumulative cache size that can be optimized across the different caches, we
derive the fundamental limits of performance by introducing a novel cache-size
optimization and placement scheme and a novel information-theoretic converse.
The converse employs new index coding techniques to bypass traditional
uniformity requirements, thus finely capturing the heterogeneity of the
problem, and it provides a new approach to handle asymmetric settings. The new
fundamental limits reveal that heterogeneous topologies can in fact outperform
their homogeneous counterparts where each cache is associated to an equal
number of users. These results are extended to capture the scenario of
topological uncertainty where the perceived/estimated topology does not match
the true network topology. This scenario is further elevated to the stochastic
setting where the user-to-cache association is random and unknown, and it is
shown that the proposed scheme is robust to such noisy or inexact knowledge on

without abstractions that impact quality of results and generalizability of
findings. We consider a macro-energy systems planning problem with detailed
operations and policy constraints and formulate a computationally efficient
Benders decomposition that separates investments from operations and further
decouples operational timesteps using budgeting variables in the the master
model. This novel approach enables parallelization of operational subproblems
and permits modeling of relevant constraints that couple decisions across time
periods (e.g. policy constraints.) Runtime scales linearly with temporal
resolution; numerical tests demonstrate substantial improvement in runtime
relative to monolithic problems using state-of-the-art commercial solvers for
all MILP formulations and for some LP formulations depending on problem size.
Our algorithm is applicable to similar planning problems in other domains (e.g.

The activity was found to control a variety of dynamical regimes, including the

adhering to constraints on the representation has been extensively studied in
the literature, with well-known results providing efficient algorithms for
fundamental representations such as planar and beyond-planar topological
drawings. In this paper, we consider the extension problem for bend-minimal
orthogonal drawings of planar connected graphs, which is among the most
fundamental geometric graph drawing representations. While the problem was
known to be \NP-hard, it is natural to consider the case where only a small
part of the graph is still to be drawn. Here, we establish the fixed-parameter
tractability of the problem when parameterized by the size of the missing
subgraph. Our algorithm is based on multiple novel ingredients which intertwine
geometric and combinatorial arguments. These include the identification of a
new graph representation of bend-equivalent regions for vertex placement in the
plane, establishing a bound on the treewidth of this auxiliary graph, and a
global point-grid that allows us to discretize the possible placement of bends
and vertices into locally bounded subgrids for each of the above regions.

detected by GRBAlpha nano-satellite without saturation. We present light curves
of the prompt emission in 13 energy bands, from 80 keV to 950 keV, and perform
a spectral analysis to calculate the peak flux and peak isotropic-equivalent
luminosity. Since the satellite's attitude information is not available for the
time of this GRB, more than 200 incident directions were probed in order to
find the median luminosity and its systematic uncertainty. We found that the
peak flux in the $80-800$ keV range (observer frame) was
$F_{\rm{ph}}^{\rm{p}}=1300_{-200}^{+1200}$ ph cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ or
$F_{\rm{erg}}^{\rm{p}}=5.7_{-0.7}^{+3.7}\times10^{-4}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
and the fluence in the same energy range of the first GRB episode lasting 300
s, which was observable by GRBAlpha, was $S=2.2_{-0.3}^{+1.4}\times10^{-2}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ or $S^{\rm{bol}}=4.9_{-0.5}^{+0.8}\times10^{-2}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ for
the extrapolated range of $0.9-8,690$ keV. We infer the isotropic-equivalent
released energy of the first GRB episode to be
$E_{\rm{iso}}^{\rm{bol}}=2.8_{-0.5}^{+0.8}\times10^{54}$ erg in the $1-10,000$
keV band (rest frame at $z=0.15$). The peak isotropic-equivalent luminosity in
the $92-920$ keV range (rest frame) was
$L_{\rm{iso}}^{\rm{p}}=3.7_{-0.5}^{+2.5}\times10^{52}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the
bolometric peak isotropic-equivalent luminosity was
$L_{\rm{iso}}^{\rm{p,bol}}=8.4_{-1.5}^{+2.5}\times10^{52}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (4 s
scale) in the $1-10,000$ keV range (rest frame). The peak emitted energy is
$E_p^\ast=E_p(1+z)=1120\pm470$ keV. Our measurement of
$L_{\rm{iso}}^{\rm{p,bol}}$ is consistent with the Yonetoku relation. It is
possible that, due to the spectral evolution of this GRB and orientation of
GRBAlpha at the peak time, the true values of peak flux, fluence,
$L_{\rm{iso}}$, and $E_{\rm{iso}}$ are even higher. [abridged]

and collects scientific data on high-energy transients, making it the smallest
astrophysical space observatory to date. GRBAlpha is an in-obit demonstration
of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector concept suitably small to fit into a
standard 1U volume. As it was demonstrated in a companion paper, GRBAlpha adds
significant value to the scientific community with accurate characterization of
bright GRBs, including the recent outstanding event of GRB 221009A. Methods.
The GRB detector is a 75x75x5 mm CsI(Tl) scintillator wrapped in a reflective
foil (ESR) read out by an array of SiPM detectors, multi-pixel photon counters
by Hamamatsu, driven by two separate, redundant units. To further protect the
scintillator block from sunlight and protect the SiPM detectors from particle
radiation, we apply a multi-layer structure of Tedlar wrapping, anodized
aluminium casing and a lead-alloy shielding on one edge of the assembly. The
setup allows observations of gamma radiation within the energy range of 70-890
keV with an energy resolution of ~30%. Results. Here, we summarize the system
design of the GRBAlpha mission, including the electronics and software
components of the detector, some aspects of the platform as well as the current
way of semi-autonomous operations. In addition, details are given about the raw
data products and telemetry in order to encourage the community for expansion

general recursive functions. For this reason, much research has gone into the
transformation and optimisation of this family of functions, in particular
those written in continuation passing style (CPS).
  Though the CPS transformation, capable of transforming any recursive function
to an equivalent tail recursive one, is deeply problematic in the context of
reversible programming (as it relies on troublesome features such as
higher-order functions), we argue that relaxing (local) reversibility to
(global) invertibility drastically improves the situation. On this basis, we
present an algorithm for tail recursion conversion specifically for invertible
functions. The key insight is that functions introduced by program
transformations that preserve invertibility, need only be invertible in the
context in which the functions subject of transformation calls them. We show
how a bespoke data type, corresponding to such a context, can be used to
transform invertible recursive functions into a pair of tail recursive function
acting on this context, in a way where calls are highlighted, and from which a
tail recursive inverse can be straightforwardly extracted.

neural computation is to derive online algorithms from principled computational
objectives and evaluate their compatibility with anatomical and physiological
observations. Similarity matching objectives have served as successful starting
points for deriving online algorithms that map onto neural networks (NNs) with
point neurons and Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity. These NN models account for
many anatomical and physiological observations; however, the objectives have
limited computational power and the derived NNs do not explain
multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity
that are prevalent throughout the brain. In this article, we review and unify
recent extensions of the similarity matching approach to address more complex
objectives, including a broad range of unsupervised and self-supervised
learning tasks that can be formulated as generalized eigenvalue problems or
nonnegative matrix factorization problems. Interestingly, the online algorithms
derived from these objectives naturally map onto NNs with multi-compartmental
neurons and local, non-Hebbian learning rules. Therefore, this unified
extension of the similarity matching approach provides a normative framework
that facilitates understanding the multi-compartmental neuronal structures and
non-Hebbian plasticity found throughout the brain.

adventures of a rogue (me) sifting through the mind of Christopher Alexander as
he left behind formalized design thinking in favor of a more intuitive, almost
spiritual process.
  The work of Christopher Alexander is familiar to many computer scientists:
for some it's patterns, for some it's the mystical **quality without a name**
and ""Nature of Order""; for many more it's ""Notes on the Synthesis of Form"" --
Alexander's formalized design method and foreshadowing ideas about cohesion and
coupling in software. Since the publication of ""Design Patterns"" by Gamma et
al. in 1994, there have been hundreds of books published about design /
software patterns, thousands of published pattern languages, and tens of
thousands of published patterns. ""Notes,"" published in 1964, was quickly
followed by one of Alexander's most important essays, ""A City is Not a Tree,""
in which he repudiates the formal method described in ""Notes,"" and his Preface
to the paperback edition of ""Notes"" in 1971 repeats the repudiation. For many
close readers of Alexander, this discontinuity is startling and unexplained.
When I finally read ""Notes"" in 2015, I was struck by the detailed worked
example, along with a peculiar mathematical treatment of the method, and a hint
that the modularization presented in the example was reckoned by a computer
program he had written -- all in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Because of my
fascination with metaheuristic optimization, I couldn't resist trying to
replicate his experimental results.
  Computers and their programs relish dwelling on flaws in your thinking --
Alexander was not exempt. By engaging in hermeneutics and software archeology,
I was able to uncover / discover the trajectory of his thinking as he
encountered failures and setbacks with his computer programs. My attempted
replication also failed, and that led me to try to unearth the five different
programs he wrote, understand them, and figure out how one led to the next.
They are not described in published papers, only in internal reports. My search
for these reports led to their being made available on the Net.
  What I found in my voyage were the early parts of a chain of thought that
started with cybernetics, mathematics, and a plain-spoken computer; passed
through ""A City is Not a Tree""; paused to ""make God appear in the middle of a
field""; and ended with this fundamental design goal: **I try to make the volume
of the building so that it carries in it all feeling. To reach this feeling, I
try to make the building so that it carries my eternal sadness. It comes, as
nearly as I can in a building, to the point of tears.**

Carlo simulations and analytical methods based on Gompertz functions under the
framework of the Least Square Method and assuming that the deaths can be
described by a convolution of the confirmed cases with a common gamma function
to describe the case to death period. Linear backgrounds both for cases and
deaths were included in the fitting to account for the contributions from other
strains within the Omicron peaks. The fitting included 125 and 113
epidemiological weeks, for cases and deaths, respectively, and 64 parameters,
resulting in a chi^2 of 176.5 for 174 degrees of freedom (p = 0.434). The CFRs
with 95% confidence intervals for USA, India, Brazil, France, Germany and

accurate and reliable information about the respective CFRs and the case to

obtained are considerably lower than previous measurements available in the

  beyond the Standard Model",,"Universe 2023; 9(2):103","10.3390/universe9020103",,"physics.gen-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Standard cosmology has long been plagued by a number of persistent problems.
The origin of the apparent acceleration of the cosmic expansion remains
enigmatic. The cosmological constant has been reintroduced as a free parameter
with a value in energy density units that ``happens'' to be of the same order
as the present matter energy density. There is an internal inconsistency with
regards to the Hubble constant, the so-called $H_0$ tension. The derived value
of $H_0$ depends on the type of data that is used. With supernovae as standard
candles one gets a $H_0$ that is 4-5 $\sigma$ larger than the value that one
gets from CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) data for the early universe. Here
we show that these problems are related and can be solved if the cosmological
constant represents a covariant integration constant that arises from a spatial
boundary condition, instead of being a new type of hypothetical physical field,
``dark energy'', as assumed by standard cosmology. The boundary condition only
applies to the bounded 3D subspace that represents the observable universe, the
hypersurface of the past light cone.

relied on a multitude of microscopic techniques. All optical, electron and
scanning probe microscopy advanced with new detector technologies and
integration of spectroscopy, imaging, and diffraction. Despite the considerable
proliferation of these instruments, significant bottlenecks remain in terms of
processing, analysis, storage, and retrieval of acquired datasets. Aside from
the lack of file standards, individual domain-specific analysis packages are
often disjoint from the underlying datasets. Thus, keeping track of analysis
and processing steps remains tedious for the end-user, hampering
reproducibility. Here, we introduce the pycroscopy ecosystem of packages, an
open-source python-based ecosystem underpinned by a common data model. Our data
model, termed the N-dimensional spectral imaging data format, is realized in
pycroscopy's sidpy package. This package is built on top of dask arrays, thus
leveraging dask array attributes but expanding them to accelerate
microscopy-relevant analysis and visualization. Several examples of the use of
the pycroscopy ecosystem to create workflows for data ingestion and analysis
are shown. Adoption of such standardized routines will be critical to usher in
the next generation of autonomous instruments where processing, computation,
and meta-data storage will be critical to overall experimental operations.

the bulk data processing. However, the impact caused by the mobility of
vehicles brings a challenge to the content scheduling and resource allocation
of content dissemination service. In this paper, we propose a time-varying
resource relationship graph to model the intertwined impact of the perception,
computation, communication and storage resources across multiple snapshots on
the content dissemination process of IoV. Based on this graph model, the
content dissemination process is modeled as a mathematical optimization
problem, where the quality of service of both delay tolerant and delay
sensitive services are considered. Owing to its NP-completeness, the
optimization problem is decomposed into a joint link and subchannel scheduling
subproblem and as well a joint power and flow control subproblem. Then, a
cascaded low complexity scheduling algorithm is proposed for the joint link and
subchannel scheduling subproblem. Moreover, a robust resource management
algorithm is developed for the power and flow control subproblem, where the
channel uncertainties in future snapshots are fully considered in the
algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations to show that the effectiveness of
the proposed approaches outperforms other state-of-art approaches.

  Training","Accepted in IEEE ICC 2023",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in learning and solving
complex tasks in a variety of fields. Nevertheless, the rise of those networks
in modern computing has been accompanied by concerns regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a novel
gradient-free, gray box, incremental attack that targets the training process
of neural networks. The proposed attack, which implicitly poisons the
intermediate data structures that retain the training instances between
training epochs acquires its high-risk property from attacking data structures
that are typically unobserved by professionals. Hence, the attack goes
unnoticed despite the damage it can cause. Moreover, the attack can be executed
without the attackers' knowledge of the neural network structure or training
data making it more dangerous. The attack was tested under a sensitive
application of secure cognitive cities, namely, biometric authentication. The
conducted experiments showed that the proposed attack is effective and
stealthy. Finally, the attack effectiveness property was concluded from the
fact that it was able to flip the sign of the loss gradient in the conducted
experiments to become positive, which indicated noisy and unstable training.
Moreover, the attack was able to decrease the inference probability in the
poisoned networks compared to their unpoisoned counterparts by 15.37%, 14.68%,
and 24.88% for the Densenet, VGG, and Xception, respectively. Finally, the
attack retained its stealthiness despite its high effectiveness. This was
demonstrated by the fact that the attack did not cause a notable increase in
the training time, in addition, the Fscore values only dropped by an average of
1.2%, 1.9%, and 1.5% for the poisoned Densenet, VGG, and Xception,
respectively.

in metropolitan areas, the Shared Autonomous Vehicle (SAV) service is expected
to increase traffic congestion and unequal access to transport services. A
paradigm of scheduled supply that is aware of demand but not on-demand is
proposed, introducing coordination and social and behavioral understanding,
urban cognition and empowerment of agents, into a novel informational
framework. Daily routines and other patterns of spatial behaviors outline a
fundamental demand layer in a supply-oriented paradigm that captures urban
dynamics and spatial-temporal behaviors, mostly in groups. Rather than
real-time requests and instant responses that reward unplanned actions, and
beyond just reservation of travels in timetables, the intention is to capture
mobility flows in scheduled travels along the day considering time of day,
places, passengers etc. Regulating goal-directed behaviors and caring for
service resources and the overall system welfare is proposed to minimize
uncertainty, considering the capacity of mobility interactions to hold value,
i.e., Motility as a Service (MaaS). The principal-agent problem in the smart
city is a problem of collective action among service providers and users that
create expectations based on previous actions and reactions in mutual systems.
Planned behavior that accounts for service coordination is expected to
stabilize excessive rides and traffic load, and to induce a cognitive gain,
thus balancing information load and facilitating cognitive effort.

complementary relationship between the circumstances one inherits and the

look at this complementarity on the basis of theoretical logic and empirical
investigation, which enables us to unearth the origin of inter-group disparity
in educational participation, as is existed across the groups defined by taking
caste and gender together in Indian society. Furthermore, in the second piece

alternative objective and diverse forward processes, not confining to the
diffusion process. By imposing prior knowledge on the loss function grounded on
MAP-based estimation, we eliminate the need for the expensive sampling of DDMs.
Also, we propose a multi-scale training, which improves the performance
compared to the diffusion process, by taking advantage of the flexibility of
the forward process. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves
the quality and efficiency of both training and inference. Furthermore, we show
the applicability of our model to inverse problems. We believe that our
framework paves the way for designing a new type of flexible general generative

drug-discovery scenarios. Since it is not always easy to find such binding
sites based on domain knowledge or traditional methods, different deep learning
methods that predict binding sites out of protein structures have been
developed in recent years. Here we present a new such deep learning algorithm,
that significantly outperformed all state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the
both resolutions$\unicode{x2013}$pocket and residue. This good performance was
also demonstrated in a case study involving the protein human serum albumin and
its binding sites. Our algorithm included new ideas both in the model
architecture and in the training method. For the model architecture, it
incorporated SE(3)-invariant geometric self-attention layers that operate on
top of residue-level CNN outputs. This residue-level processing of the model
allowed a transfer learning between the two resolutions, which turned out to
significantly improve the binding pocket prediction. Moreover, we developed
novel augmentation method based on protein homology, which prevented our model
from over-fitting. Overall, we believe that our contribution to the literature
is twofold. First, we provided a new computational method for binding site
prediction that is relevant to real-world applications, as shown by the good
performance on different benchmarks and case study. Second, the novel ideas in

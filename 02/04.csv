sequence nature. Existing methods primarily focus on pair-wise interaction of
body joints, which is insufficient for scenarios involving overlapping joints
and rapidly changing poses. To overcome these issues, we introduce a novel
approach, the High-order Directed Transformer (HDFormer), which leverages
high-order bone and joint relationships for improved pose estimation.
Specifically, HDFormer incorporates both self-attention and high-order
attention to formulate a multi-order attention module. This module facilitates
first-order ""joint$\leftrightarrow$joint"", second-order
""bone$\leftrightarrow$joint"", and high-order ""hyperbone$\leftrightarrow$joint""
interactions, effectively addressing issues in complex and occlusion-heavy
situations. In addition, modern CNN techniques are integrated into the
transformer-based architecture, balancing the trade-off between performance and
efficiency. HDFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models
on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets, requiring only 1/10 of the parameters
and significantly lower computational costs. Moreover, HDFormer demonstrates
broad real-world applicability, enabling real-time, accurate 3D pose
estimation. The source code is in https://github.com/hyer/HDFormer

We experimentally evaluate our algorithm on synthetic and real-world data on a

topological phases. Hence, their connections with experimentally measurable
quantities are extremely important. In this context, circular dichroism (CD)
provides a protocol to detect the Chern number $\mathcal{C}_0$ of the lowest
energy Bloch band (LBB) of a semimetal. This hinges on the unequal depletion
rates of the Bloch electrons from a filled LBB, under the action of a
time-periodic circular drive, depending on the chirality of the polarization.
According to the dimensionality of the system (i.e., whether it is two- or
three-dimensional), the integrated differential rate for depletion has to be
formulated a bit differently in order to relate it to $\mathcal{C}_0$. Our aim
is to capture the nature of the CD response for semimetals with anisotropic
band dispersions. We show that while the quantization of the CD response for
the three-dimensional cases is strongly sensitive to anisotropy, the
two-dimensional counterparts show a perfectly quantized response.

a single concept: combinatorial Hopf algebra. Transformer learning emerges as a
result of the subtle interplay between the algebraic and coalgebraic operations
of the combinatorial Hopf algebra. Viewed through this lens, the transformer
model becomes a linear time-invariant system where the attention mechanism
computes a generalized convolution transform and the residual stream serves as
a unit impulse. Attention-only transformers then learn by enforcing an
invariant between these two paths. We call this invariant Hopf coherence. Due
to this, with a degree of poetic license, one could call combinatorial Hopf
algebras ""tensors with a built-in loss function gradient"". This loss function
gradient occurs within the single layers and no backward pass is needed. This
is in contrast to automatic differentiation which happens across the whole
graph and needs a explicit backward pass. This property is the result of the
fact that combinatorial Hopf algebras have the surprising property of
calculating eigenvalues by repeated squaring.

derive the optimal attack strategy against a Gaussian transmission from Alice,
by minimizing an outer bound on the achievable error probability region of the
spoofing detection test. Then, framing the spoofing and its detection as an
adversarial game, we show that the Gaussian transmission and the corresponding
optimal attack constitute a Nash equilibrium. Lastly, we consider the case of
practical modulation schemes for Alice and derive the generalized likelihood

representation-level morphs. Our vulnerability analyses on four
state-of-the-art face recognition models have shown that such models are highly
vulnerable to the created attacks, the MorDIFF, especially when compared to
existing representation-level morphs. Detailed detectability analyses are also
performed on the MorDIFF, showing that they are as challenging to detect as
other morphing attacks created on the image- or representation-level. Data and
morphing script are made public: https://github.com/naserdamer/MorDIFF.

description of these as well as an insight into small and large time scales as

we calculated curvature and torsion probability density functions (PDFs) of
experimental Lagrangian trajectories processed using the Shake-the-Box
algorithm of turbulent von K\'arm\'an flow, Rayleigh-B\'enard convection and a
zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer over a flat plate. The results for the
von K\'arm\'an flow compare well with experimental results for the curvature
PDF and numerical simulation of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence for the
torsion PDF. For the experimental Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, the power law
tails found agree with those measured for von K\'arm\'an flow. Results for the
logarithmic layer within the boundary layer differ slightly, we give some
potential explanation below. To detect and quantify the effect of anisotropy
either resulting from a mean flow or large-scale coherent motions on the
geometry or tracer particle trajectories, we introduce the curvature vector. We
connect its statistics with those of velocity fluctuations and demonstrate that
strong large-scale motion in a given spatial direction results in meandering

AstroSat/UVIT observations of the spiral galaxy UGC 10420 (z=0.032), a member
of the cluster Abell 2199. UGC 10420 is present on the edge of the X-ray
emitting region of the cluster at a distance of ~ 680 kpc from the centre. The
FUV data shows intense knots of star formation on the leading edge of the
galaxy, accompanied by a tail of the same on the diametrically opposite side.
Our analysis shows that the images of the galaxy disk in the optical and
mid-infrared are much smaller in size than that in the FUV. While the broadband
optical colours of UGC 10420 are typical of a post-starburst galaxy, the SFR
derived from a UV-to-IR spectral energy distribution is at least a factor of
nine higher than that expected for a star-forming field galaxy of similar mass
at its redshift. A careful removal of the contribution of the diffuse
intracluster gas shows that the significant diffuse X-ray emission associated
with the inter-stellar medium of UGC 10420 has a temperature, T_X =
0.24^{+0.09}_{-0.06} keV (0.4-2.0 keV) and luminosity, L_X = 1.8+/-0.9 x
10^{40} erg/s, which are typical of the X-ray emission from late-type spiral
galaxies.
  Our analysis favours a scenario where the interaction of a galaxy with the
hot intra-cluster medium of the cluster, perturbs the gas in the galaxy causing
starburst in the leading edge of the disk. On the other hand, the turbulence
thus developed may also push some of the gas out of the disk. Interactions
between the gas ejected from the galaxy and the intracluster medium can then
locally trigger star formation in the wake of the galaxy experiencing
ram-pressure stripping. Our data however does not rule out the possibility of a
flyby encounter with a neighbouring galaxy, although no relevant candidates are
observed in the vicinity of UGC 10420. (abridged)

representations). Thus the number of embedding parameters increases linearly as
the growth of knowledge graphs. In our proposed model, Entity-Agnostic
Representation Learning (EARL), we only learn the embeddings for a small set of
entities and refer to them as reserved entities. To obtain the embeddings for
the full set of entities, we encode their distinguishable information from
their connected relations, k-nearest reserved entities, and multi-hop
neighbors. We learn universal and entity-agnostic encoders for transforming
distinguishable information into entity embeddings. This approach allows our
proposed EARL to have a static, efficient, and lower parameter count than
conventional knowledge graph embedding methods. Experimental results show that
EARL uses fewer parameters and performs better on link prediction tasks than

disk of these three old stars measured at 70 $\mu$m is very small - in fact, it
is lower than that of the Kuiper belt of our Solar system by several orders of
magnitude. These results are not surprising, as they remain within the values
expected for the stellar disk evolution of such primitive stars. In parallel,
we found another six thick-disk stars containing only debris disks or planets.
These results enable us to establish a correlation between stellar metallicity

This refined ephemeris will enable further follow-up of this outstanding

of catching transiting exomoons. We conducted a search for exomoon signals in
this single-epoch light curve but found no conclusive photometric signature of

a general property that individual differences in initial behavior are more

robustness, and gave a general method for converting robust algorithms to
private ones. However, all general methods for transforming robust algorithms
into private ones lead to suboptimal error rates. Our work gives the first
black-box transformation that converts any adversarially robust algorithm into

low-dimensional estimation task, applying our transformation to an optimal
robust estimator results in an optimal private estimator. Thus, we conclude
that for any low-dimensional task, the optimal error rate for
$\varepsilon$-differentially private estimators is essentially the same as the
optimal error rate for estimators that are robust to adversarially corrupting
$1/\varepsilon$ training samples. We apply our transformation to obtain new
optimal private estimators for several high-dimensional tasks, including

descriptor suitable only for one graph generating mechanism. In this manner, we
naturally consider the global properties of a graph and capture its important
graph-theoretic and topological properties. Under an increasingly complex set

localization precision and negligible drift on artificially created datasets,
the aspects of reliability in non-ideal situations, robustness to degraded

We identify the conditions that are critical for a reliable flight under VIO
localization and propose workarounds and compensations for situations in which
such conditions cannot be achieved. The performance of the UAV system with

have achieved excellent performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing datasets.
However, since the target objects in these existing datasets are usually
relatively salient, dominant, and isolated, VOS under complex scenes has rarely
been studied. To revisit VOS and make it more applicable in the real world, we
collect a new VOS dataset called coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) to
study the tracking and segmenting objects in complex environments. MOSE
contains 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects from 36 categories, with 431,725
high-quality object segmentation masks. The most notable feature of MOSE
dataset is complex scenes with crowded and occluded objects. The target objects
in the videos are commonly occluded by others and disappear in some frames. To
analyze the proposed MOSE dataset, we benchmark 18 existing VOS methods under 4
different settings on the proposed MOSE dataset and conduct comprehensive
comparisons. The experiments show that current VOS algorithms cannot well
perceive objects in complex scenes. For example, under the semi-supervised VOS
setting, the highest J&F by existing state-of-the-art VOS methods is only 59.4%
on MOSE, much lower than their ~90% J&F performance on DAVIS. The results
reveal that although excellent performance has been achieved on existing
benchmarks, there are unresolved challenges under complex scenes and more
efforts are desired to explore these challenges in the future. The proposed

establishing feasibility results, another equally important direction, that of

we obtain many interesting implications to unclonable cryptography, including
the following:
  1. We obtain the first construction of information-theoretically secure
single-decryptor encryption in the one-time setting.
  2. We construct unclonable encryption in the quantum random oracle model

meet the diverse needs of various DNNs for computational accuracy. Experimental
results evaluated under the 28nm CMOS process show that PDPU reduces area,

of planning and the generalizability to new tasks. This paper introduces
AdaptDiffuser, an evolutionary planning method with diffusion that can
self-evolve to improve the diffusion model hence a better planner, not only for
seen tasks but can also adapt to unseen tasks. AdaptDiffuser enables the
generation of rich synthetic expert data for goal-conditioned tasks using
guidance from reward gradients. It then selects high-quality data via a
discriminator to finetune the diffusion model, which improves the
generalization ability to unseen tasks. Empirical experiments on two benchmark
environments and two carefully designed unseen tasks in KUKA industrial robot
arm and Maze2D environments demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptDiffuser. For
example, AdaptDiffuser not only outperforms the previous art Diffuser by 20.8%
on Maze2D and 7.5% on MuJoCo locomotion, but also adapts better to new tasks,

CGs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 to analyse these
systems and their galaxies when embedded in different cosmological structures.
To achieve this goal, we identify several cosmological structures where CGs can
reside: Nodes of filaments, Loose Groups, Filaments and cosmic Voids. Our
results indicate that 45 per cent of CGs do not reside in any of these
structures, i.e., they can be considered non-embedded or isolated systems. Most
of the embedded CGs are found inhabiting Loose Groups and Nodes, while there
are almost no CGs residing well inside cosmic Voids. Some physical properties
of CGs vary depending on the environment they inhabit. CGs in Nodes show the
largest velocity dispersions, the brightest absolute magnitude of the
first-ranked galaxy, and the smallest crossing times, while the opposite occurs
in Non-Embedded CGs. When comparing galaxies in all the environments and
galaxies in CGs, CGs show the highest fractions of red/early-type galaxy
members in most of the absolute magnitudes ranges. The variation between
galaxies in CGs inhabiting one or another environment is not as significant as
the differences caused by belonging or not to a CG. Our results suggest a
plausible scenario for galaxy evolution in CGs in which both, large-scale and
local environments play essential roles.

volumes of climate-change and infrastructure-related scientific literature.
However, best-in-practice NLP techniques require large collections of relevant

learning techniques require labels grouping the articles based on user-defined
criteria for a significant subset of a corpus in order to train the supervised
model. Even labeling a few hundred documents with human subject-matter experts
is a time-consuming process. To expedite this process, we developed a weak
supervision-based NLP approach that leverages semantic similarity between
categories and documents to (i) establish a topic-specific corpus by subsetting
a large-scale open-access corpus and (ii) generate category labels for the
topic-specific corpus. In comparison with a months-long process of
subject-matter expert labeling, we assign category labels to the whole corpus
using weak supervision and supervised learning in about 13 hours. The labeled
climate and NCF corpus enable targeted, efficient identification of documents
discussing a topic (or combination of topics) of interest and identification of
various effects of climate change on critical infrastructure, improving the
usability of scientific literature and ultimately supporting enhanced policy

on pairs of climate hazards and NCFs to discover trending topics at the
intersection of these categories. This method is useful for analysts and
decision-makers to quickly grasp the relevant topics and most important

moments as meta-GGA and hybrid density functional approximations. Our findings
point to the need for improved orbitals/wavefunctions for this class of

multi-reference effects that capture the static correlations for an accurate
prediction of magnetic properties. The necessity for multi-reference treatment
is motivated by extrapolating the dynamic correlations to the exact limit.

crossing in bulk to be close to the Fermi level, within $\sim 120$ meV, in

equation or wavefunction collapse. So far, deterministic control of quantum
many-body systems in the lab has focused on the former, due to the
probabilistic nature of measurements. This imposes serious limitations:
preparing long-range entangled states, for example, requires extensive circuit
depth if restricted to unitary dynamics. In this work, we use mid-circuit
measurement and feed-forward to implement deterministic non-unitary dynamics on
Quantinuum's H1 programmable ion-trap quantum computer. Enabled by these
capabilities, we demonstrate for the first time a constant-depth procedure for
creating a toric code ground state in real-time. In addition to reaching high
stabilizer fidelities, we create a non-Abelian defect whose presence is
confirmed by transmuting anyons via braiding. This work clears the way towards
creating complex topological orders in the lab and exploring deterministic
non-unitary dynamics via measurement and feed-forward.

need for more efficient collaboration among multiple teams. For example, when a
research team invents a new architecture like ""ResNet,"" it is desirable for
multiple engineering teams to adopt it. However, the effort required for each
team to study and understand the invention does not scale well with the number
of teams or inventions. In this paper, we present an extension of our PyGlove
library to easily and scalably share ML ideas. PyGlove represents ideas as
symbolic rule-based patches, enabling researchers to write down the rules for
models they have not seen. For example, an inventor can write rules that will
""add skip-connections."" This permits a network effect among teams: at once, any
team can issue patches to all other teams. Such a network effect allows users
to quickly surmount the cost of adopting PyGlove by writing less code quicker,
providing a benefit that scales with time. We describe the new paradigm of
organizing ML through symbolic patches and compare it to existing approaches.
We also perform a case study of a large codebase where PyGlove led to an 80%
reduction in the number of lines of code.

numerosity, can exhibit behaviors that depend sensitively on it. This paper
proves that the collective behavior of number-oblivious individuals can even
have a critical numerosity, above and below which it qualitatively differs. We
formalize the concept of critical numerosity in terms of a family of zero--one
laws and introduce a model of collective motion, called chain activation and
transport (CAT), that has one.
  CAT describes the collective motion of $n \geq 2$ individuals as a Markov
chain that rearranges $n$-element subsets of the $d$-dimensional grid, $m < n$
elements at a time. According to the individuals' dynamics, with each step, CAT
removes $m$ elements from the set and then progressively adds $m$ elements to
the boundary of what remains, in a way that favors the consecutive addition and
removal of nearby elements. This paper proves that, if $d \geq 3$, then CAT has
a critical numerosity of $n_c = 2m+2$ with respect to the behavior of its
diameter. Specifically, if $n < n_c$, then the elements form one ""cluster,"" the
diameter of which has an a.s.--finite limit infimum. However, if $n \geq n_c$,
then there is an a.s.--finite time at which the set consists of clusters of
between $m+1$ and $2m+1$ elements, and forever after which these clusters grow
apart, resulting in unchecked diameter growth.
  The existence of critical numerosities means that collectives can exhibit
""phase transitions"" that are governed purely by their numerosity and not, for
example, their density or the strength of their interactions. This fact
challenges prevalent beliefs about collective behavior and suggests new
functionality for programmable matter. More broadly, it demonstrates an
opportunity to explore the possible behaviors collectives through the study of
random processes that rearrange sets.

low-complexity and preserve the desirable high access speed in modern Flash

different charge levels. We also demonstrate the performance improvement
achieved via RR coding on a practical triple-level cell Flash device.

isocurvature perturbations (CIP), which are opposite-sign primordial baryon and
dark matter perturbations that leave the total matter density unchanged.
Long-wavelength CIP $\sigma(\vec{x})$ enter the galaxy density contrast as
$\delta_g(\vec{x}) \supset b_\sigma\sigma(\vec{x})$, with $b_\sigma$ the linear
CIP galaxy bias parameter. We parameterize the CIP spectra as $P_{\sigma\sigma}
= A^2P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}$ and $P_{\sigma\mathcal{R}} =
\xi\sqrt{P_{\sigma\sigma}P_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}}$, where $A$ is the CIP
amplitude and $\xi$ is the correlation with the curvature perturbations
$\mathcal{R}$. We find a significance of detection of $Ab_\sigma \neq 0$ of
$1.8\sigma$ for correlated ($\xi = 1$) and $3.7\sigma$ for uncorrelated ($\xi =
0$) CIP. Large-scale data systematics have a bigger impact for uncorrelated
CIP, which may explain the large significance of detection. The constraints on
$A$ depend on the assumed priors for the $b_\sigma$ parameter, which we
estimate using separate universe simulations. Assuming $b_\sigma$ values
representative of all halos we find $\sigma_A = 145$ for correlated CIP and
$\sigma_{|A|} = 475$ for uncorrelated CIP. Our strongest uncorrelated CIP
constraint is for $b_\sigma$ representative of the $33\%$ most concentrated
halos, $\sigma_{|A|} = 197$, which is better than the current CMB bounds $|A|
\lesssim 360$. We also discuss the impact of the local primordial
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ in CIP constraints. Our results
demonstrate the power of galaxy data to place tight constraints on CIP, and
motivate works to understand better the impact of data systematics, as well as
to determine theory priors for $b_\sigma$.

learning approaches suffer from representation misalignment, where the robot's
learned representation does not capture the human's representation. We suggest
that because humans will be the ultimate evaluator of robot performance in the

task representations with humans, in addition to learning the downstream task.
We advocate that current representation learning approaches in robotics should
be studied from the perspective of how well they accomplish the objective of
representation alignment. To do so, we mathematically define the problem,
identify its key desiderata, and situate current robot learning methods within

show a source count distribution which, in the resolved regime, is in excellent
agreement with the one derived from catalogued sources, and then extends as
$dN/dS \sim S^{-2}$ in the unresolved regime, down to fluxes of $5 \cdot

5100 \AA (SNR$_{5100}$) $>$10 containing 11415 quasars. The median total
luminosity (log ($L_\text{total}$/[erg s$^{-1}$])), stellar luminosity (log

($L_\text{cont}$/[erg s$^{-1}$])) in our sample are 44.52, 44.06, and 44.30,
respectively. We fit the AGN power-law continuum, host galaxy, and iron blend
contribution, simultaneously over the entire available spectrum. We found the
host galaxy fraction to anti-correlate with continuum luminosity and can be
well-represented by a polynomial function, which can be used to correct the
stellar light contribution from AGN spectra. We also found anti-correlation
between host galaxy fraction and iron strength, Eddington ratio, and redshift.
The empirical relation gives comparable results of host-fraction with the image

connectivity between wells. The results inform engineering decisions about well
spacing. In this paper, we propose a new procedure for interpreting
interference tests. We fit the initial interference response with the solution
to the 1D diffusivity equation at an offset observation point. It is
advantageous to use the initial interference response, rather than the
subsequent trend, because it is less affected by nonlinearities, time-varying
boundary conditions, and uncertainties about flow geometry and regime. From the
curve fit, we estimate the hydraulic diffusivity and conductivity of the
fractures connecting the wells. For engineering purposes, it would be useful to
quantify the impact of interference on well production. Thus, we seek a
relationship between the degree of production interference (DPI) and an
appropriate dimensionless quantity that can be derived from the estimate of
fracture conductivity. Using simulations run under a wide range of conditions,
we find that the classical definition for dimensionless fracture conductivity
does not achieve a consistent prediction of DPI. This occurs because the
dimensionless fracture conductivity is derived assuming radial flow geometry,
but the dominant flow geometry during shale production is linear. We also find
that the CPG (Chow Pressure Group) metric does not yield consistently accurate
predictions of DPI. As an alternative, we derive a dimensionless quantity
similar to the classical dimensionless fracture conductivity, but derived for
linear, flow geometry. Using this approach, we calculate a dimensionless
interference length that collapses all cases onto a single curve that predicts
DPI as a function of fracture conductivity, well spacing, and formation
properties. We conclude by applying the new method to field cases from the
Anadarko and Delaware Basins.

magnitudes H < 16m, in the 3:1, 5:2 and 2:1 mean motion resonances (MMRs) with
Jupiter were selected. The number of the orbits in the 2:1 MMR is dozens times
greater than in the other two resonances.
  There are fragments of parent bodies of neighbour asteroid families, in
particular the Themis family, among bodies in the 2:1 MMR.
  Numerical calculations were performed to evaluate the evolution of the
selected orbits over hundreds of thousand years. Perturbations from all eight
major planets and the relativistic effects of orbital perihelion displacement
were taken into account. For all orbits in the 3:1 and 5:2 MMRs an increase in
the orbit eccentricities, which are sufficient for the bodies to approach Mars,
was obtained. In the 2:1 MMR, a sufficient increase in the orbit eccentricities
was not detected.
  An increase in orbit eccentricities in this resonance can occur due to the
action of non-gravitational effects (NGEs). The action of the Yarkovsky effect
can explain the exit of an asteroid with a size of 5 km from the 2:1 MMR over a
period about 1 billion years or more. More than 2 billion years ago, there were
dozens of bodies over 50 km in size in the 2:1 gap. To form the gap in the 2:1
resonance at the very beginning, the physical conditions in the asteroid belt
had to be significantly different from the today ones. In particular, the
intensity of the solar radiation in the early Solar system could be much higher
as compared to the today one.

However, how the creators' competition impacts user welfare and how the

  This work provides theoretical insights into these research questions. We
model the creators' competition under the assumptions that: 1) the platform

the Random Utility model; 3) content creators compete for user engagement and,
without knowing their utility function in hindsight, apply arbitrary no-regret

user welfare loss due to creator competition is always upper bounded by a small
constant depending on $K$ and randomness in user decisions; we also prove the
tightness of this bound. Our result discloses an intrinsic merit of the myopic
approach to the recommendation, i.e., relevance-driven matching performs
reasonably well in the long run, as long as users' decisions involve randomness
and the platform provides reasonably many alternatives to its users.

heavily on seamless interconnections between shared electric vehicles (SEV),

short-term breakdowns or long-term degradation of the ESMS. This study focuses
on one such attack with long-lasting effects, the Delayed Charge Attack (DCA),
that stealthily delays the charging service by exploiting the physical and
communication vulnerabilities. To begin, we present the ESMS threat model by
highlighting the assets, information flow, and access points. We next identify
a linked sequence of vulnerabilities as a viable attack vector for launching
DCA. Then, we detail the implementation of DCA, which can effectively bypass
the detection in the SEV's battery management system and the cross-verification
in the cloud environment. We test the DCA model against various Anomaly
Detection (AD) algorithms by simulating the DCA dynamics in a
Susceptible-Infectious-Removed-Susceptible (SIRS) process, where the EVSE can
be compromised by the DCA or detected for repair. Using real-world taxi trip
data and EVSE locations in New York City, the DCA model allows us to explore
the long-term impacts and validate the system consequences. The results show
that a 10-min delay will result in 12-min longer queuing times and 8% more
unfulfilled requests, leading to a 10.7% (\$311.7) weekly revenue loss per

Therefore, we study how to inform defensive decision-making to mitigate the
risk from boundedly rational players, with a particular focus on making
integrated, interdependent planning decisions. To achieve this goal, we
introduce a modeling framework for selecting a portfolio of security
mitigations that interdict adversarial attack plans that uses a structured

cognitive hierarchy theory to consider a maximum reliability path interdiction
problem with a single defender and multiple attackers who have different goals

framework for distributed message-passing systems. The communication protocol
of the system is specified as a global type, from which a collection of local
types (local process implementations) is obtained by endpoint projection. A
global type is a single disciplining entity for the whole system, specified by
one designer that has full knowledge of the communication protocol. On the
other hand, distributed systems are often described in terms of their
components: a different designer is in charge of providing a subprotocol for
each component. The problem of modular specification of global protocols has
been addressed in the literature, but the state of the art focuses only on dual
input/output compatibility. Our work overcomes this limitation. We propose the
first MPST theory of multiparty compositionality for distributed protocol
specification that is semantics-preserving, allows the composition of two or
more components, and retains full MPST expressiveness. We introduce hybrid
types for describing subprotocols interacting with each other, define a novel
compatibility relation, explicitly describe an algorithm for composing multiple
subprotocols into a well-formed global type, and prove that compositionality
preserves projection, thus retaining semantic guarantees, such as liveness and
deadlock freedom. Finally, we test our work against real-world case studies and

First, complex traits are often associated with many single nucleotide

difficult to detect. Second, many complex traits share a common genetic basis
due to `pleiotropy' and and though few methods consider it, leveraging
pleiotropy can improve statistical power to detect genotype-trait associations
with weaker effect sizes. Third, currently available statistical methods are
limited in explaining the functional mechanisms through which genetic variants
are associated with specific or multiple traits. We propose multi-GPA-Tree to
address these challenges. The multi-GPA-Tree approach can identify risk SNPs
associated with single as well as multiple traits while also identifying the
combinations of functional annotations that can explain the mechanisms through
which risk-associated SNPs are linked with the traits.
  First, we implemented simulation studies to evaluate the proposed

instrumental properties of the corresponding covering map and proposes a hybrid
dynamic path-lifting algorithm to uniquely and consistently extract the MRP

patterns of each entity's metric data (i.e., time series), and estimates its
likelihood of being a root cause based on the Extreme Value theory. Combining
the topological and individual causal scores, the top K system entities are
identified as root causes. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets
with case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
framework.

that specific complex frequencies could be used to describe both ordinary and

preferences of voters, proportional representation is often a major
desideratum. When going beyond simplistic models such as party-list or
district-based elections, it is surprisingly challenging to capture
proportionality formally. As a consequence, the literature has produced
numerous competing criteria of when a selected committee qualifies as
proportional. Two of the most prominent notions are Dummett's proportionality
for solid coalitions (PSC) and Aziz et al.'s extended justified representation
(EJR). Both guarantee proportional representation to groups of voters who have
very similar preferences; such groups are referred to as solid coalitions by
Dummett and as cohesive groups by Aziz et al. However, these notions lose their
bite when groups are only almost solid or almost cohesive. In this paper, we
propose proportionality axioms that are more robust: they guarantee
representation also to groups that do not qualify as solid or cohesive.
Further, our novel axioms can be easily verified: Given a committee, we can
check in polynomial time whether it satisfies the axiom or not. This is in
contrast to many established notions like EJR, for which the corresponding
verification problem is known to be intractable.
  In the setting with approval preferences, we propose a robust and verifiable
variant of EJR and a simply greedy procedure to compute committees satisfying
it. In the setting with ranked preferences, we propose a robust variant PSC,
which can be efficiently verified even for general weak preferences. In the
special case of strict preferences, our notion is the first known satisfiable
proportionality axiom that is violated by the Single Transferable Vote (STV).
We also discuss implications of our results for participatory budgeting,
querying procedures, and to the notion of proportionality degree.

as object segmentation and object detection, are computationally heavy
algorithms, requiring large memory and computing power. Many UAVs are using
(pretrained) off-the-shelf versions of such algorithms. Offloading such
power-hungry algorithms to a remote server could help UAVs save power
significantly. However, deep learning based algorithms are susceptible to
noise, and a wireless communication system, by its nature, introduces noise to
the original signal. When the signal represents an image, noise affects the
image. There has not been much work studying the effect of the noise introduced
by the communication system on pretrained deep networks. In this work, we first
analyze how reliable it is to offload deep learning based computer vision tasks
(including both object segmentation and detection) by focusing on the effect of
various parameters of a 5G wireless communication system on the transmitted
image and demonstrate how the introduced noise of the used 5G wireless
communication system reduces the performance of the offloaded deep learning
task. Then solutions are introduced to eliminate (or reduce) the negative
effect of the noise. The proposed framework starts with introducing many
classical techniques as alternative solutions first, and then introduces a
novel deep learning based solution to denoise the given noisy input image. The
performance of various denoising algorithms on offloading both object
segmentation and object detection tasks are compared. Our proposed deep
transformer-based denoiser algorithm (NR-Net) yields the state-of-the-art

given using Cauchy characteristic curves giving necessary and sufficient

semi-supervised learners (SSL) can extrapolate labels from a small number of
examples to the rest of the data. Standard SSL algorithms use ``weak''
knowledge (i.e. those not based on specific SE knowledge) such as (e.g.)
co-train two learners and use good labels from one to train the other. Another
approach of SSL in software analytics is potentially use ``strong'' knowledge
that use SE knowledge. For example, an often-used heuristic in SE is that
unusually large artifacts contain undesired properties (e.g. more bugs). This
paper argues that such ``strong'' algorithms perform better than those
standard, weaker, SSL algorithms. We show this by learning models from labels
generated using weak SSL or our ``stronger'' FRUGAL algorithm. In four domains
(distinguishing security-related bug reports; mitigating bias in
decision-making; predicting issue close time; and (reducing false alarms in
static code warnings), FRUGAL required only 2.5% of the data to be labeled yet

approach to overcome this challenge. This algorithm performs semi-supervised
domain adaptation and can be applied to datasets with different data
distributions and class overlaps. Non-overlapping classes can be present in any
of the two datasets (the labeled source domain, or the unlabeled target
domain), and the method can even be used in the presence of unknown classes. We
apply our method to three examples of galaxy morphology classification tasks of
different complexities ($3$-class and $10$-class problems), with anomaly
detection: 1) datasets created after different numbers of observing years from
a single survey (LSST mock data of $1$ and $10$ years of observations); 2) data
from different surveys (SDSS and DECaLS); and 3) data from observing fields
with different depths within one survey (wide field and Stripe 82 deep field of

service for advertisers to manage their ad campaigns. Given the inherent
non-stationarity in an advertiser's value and also competing advertisers'
values over time, a commonly used approach is to learn a target expenditure
plan that specifies a target spend as a function of time, and then run a
controller that tracks this plan. This raises the question: how many historical
samples are required to learn a good expenditure plan? We study this question
by considering an advertiser repeatedly participating in $T$ second-price
auctions, where the tuple of her value and the highest competing bid is drawn
from an unknown time-varying distribution. The advertiser seeks to maximize her
total utility subject to her budget constraint. Prior work has shown the
sufficiency of $T\log T$ samples per distribution to achieve the optimal

linear correlation relationship between nominal data and numerical data.
Correlation coefficients for variables coded with real numbers as well as for
variables coded with complex numbers were studied. For variables coded with
real numbers, unambiguous measures of real linear correlation were obtained. In
the case of complex coding, it has been observed that the obtained complex
correlation coefficients change with the permutation of the phases in the
complex numbers used to code classes of elements with equal cardinalities. It
was found that a necessary condition for linear correlation is the possibility
of linear ordering of a set with data. Since linear order is not possible in
the set of complex numbers, complex correlation coefficients cannot be used as
a measure of linear correlation. In the event of such a situation, a substitute
action was suggested that would prevent equal cardinality of classes of
identical elements contained in the set with nominal data. This action would
consist in the correction of data, analogous to the correction during
preprocessing or cleaning of data containing missing or outlier values.

well-known tools of natural language processing to extract keywords from a

create a punch line. Then a pretrained neural network language model that has
been fine-tuned on a dataset of TV show monologue jokes is used to complete the
joke response by filling the gap between the topic sentence and the punch line.
A method of internal scoring filters out jokes that don't meet a preset

sentences to be jokes more than 40% of the time. This is evidence that
Witscript represents an important next step toward giving a chatbot a humanlike

of the energy released manifesting as non-thermal particles. While the role
that non-thermal electrons play in transporting flare energy is well studied,
the properties and importance of non-thermal protons is rather less well
understood. This is in large part due to the paucity of diagnostics,
particularly at the lower-energy (deka-keV) range of non-thermal proton
distributions in flares. One means to identify the presence of deka-keV protons
is by an effect originally described by \cite{1976ApJ...208..618O}. In the
Orrall-Zirker effect, non-thermal protons interact with ambient neutral
hydrogen, and via charge exchange produce a population of energetic neutral
atoms (ENAs) in the chromosphere. These ENAs subsequently produce an extremely
redshifted photon in the red wings of hydrogen spectral lines. We revisit
predictions of the strength of this effect using modern interaction
cross-sections, and numerical models capable of self-consistently simulating
the flaring non-equilibrium ionization stratification, and the non-thermal
proton distribution (and, crucially, their feedback on each other). We
synthesize both the thermal and non-thermal emission from \lya\ and \lyb, the
most promising lines that may exhibit a detectable signal. These new
predictions are are weaker and more transient than prior estimates, but the
effects should be detectable in fortuitous circumstances. We degrade the \lyb\
emission to the resolution of the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment

difficult, it should be possible to detect the presence of non-thermal protons

particles is dully accounted for. For the first time a competitive DM model
based on first physical principles, such as (quantum) statistical-mechanics and
thermodynamics, is tested against a large data-set of galactic observables. In
particular, we compare the fermionic DM model with empirical DM profiles: the
NFW model, a generalized NFW model accounting for baryonic feedback, the
Einasto model and the Burkert model. For this task, we use a large sample of
120 galaxies taken from the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves

models. We find that the Radial Acceleration Relation and MDAR are well
explained by all the models with comparable accuracy, while the fits to the
individual rotation curves, in contrast, show that cored DM halos are
statistically preferred with respect to the cuspy NFW profile. However, very
different physical principles justify the flat inner halo slope in the most

and its abundance cannot be explained only by reactions in the gas phase. This
work explores a new gas-phase formation mechanism for glycolaldehyde and
compares the energy barrier reduction when the same route happens on the
surface of amorphous ices. The first step of the mechanism involves the
formation of a carbon-carbon bond between formaldehyde (H2CO) and the formyl
radical (HCO), with an energy barrier of 27 kJ mol-1 (gas-phase). The second
step consists of barrierless hydrogen addition. Density functional calculations
under periodic boundary conditions were applied to study this reaction path on
10 different amorphous ice surfaces through an Eley-Rideal type mechanism. It
was found that the energy barrier is reduced on average by 49 per cent, leading
in some cases to a 100 per cent reduction. The calculated adsorption energy of
glycolaldehyde suggests that it can be promptly desorbed to the gas phase after
its formation. This work, thus contributes to explaining the detected relative

in an increase in the estimate of the bulk flow in a sphere of radius
$150h^{-1}$Mpc relative to the CosmicFlows-3 (CF3). This bulk flow has less
than a $0.03\%$ chance of occurring in the Standard Cosmological Model

the CF4 is deeper than the CF3, we were able to use the CF4 to accurately
estimate the bulk flow on scales of $200h^{-1}$Mpc (equivalent to 266 Mpc for
Hubble constant $H_o=75$ km/s/Mpc) for the first time. This bulk flow is in
even greater tension with the Standard Model, having less than $0.003\%$

Few-shot in-context learning using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) has

few-shot identification of a psycho-linguistic concept, Morality Frames (Roy et

the relevant moral foundation (Haidt and Graham, 2007) and at a finer level of

plethora of measurement platforms to monitor and expose it. Censorship of the
domain name system (DNS) is a key mechanism used across different countries. It
is currently detected by applying heuristics to samples of DNS queries and
responses (probes) for specific destinations. These heuristics, however, are
both platform-specific and have been found to be brittle when censors change
their blocking behavior, necessitating a more reliable automated process for
detecting censorship. In this paper, we explore how machine learning (ML)
models can (1) help streamline the detection process, (2) improve the usability
of large-scale datasets for censorship detection, and (3) discover new
censorship instances and blocking signatures missed by existing heuristic
methods. Our study shows that supervised models, trained using expert-derived
labels on instances of known anomalies and possible censorship, can learn the
detection heuristics employed by different measurement platforms. More
crucially, we find that unsupervised models, trained solely on uncensored
instances, can identify new instances and variations of censorship missed by
existing heuristics. Moreover, both methods demonstrate the capability to
uncover a substantial number of new DNS blocking signatures, i.e., injected
fake IP addresses overlooked by existing heuristics. These results are
underpinned by an important methodological finding: comparing the outputs of
models trained using the same probes but with labels arising from independent
processes allows us to more reliably detect cases of censorship in the absence
of ground-truth labels of censorship.

Composite fermion quasiparticles are randomly localized at high levels of

fermion quasiparticles cluster into a bubble, then these bubbles order on a
lattice. Such a highly correlated ground state was termed the bubble phase of
composite fermions. Here we report the observation of this bubble phase of
composite fermions, evidenced by the reentrance of the fractional quantum Hall

network slicing to distinguish customers in the same traffic class using new
QoS technologies in the RF domain. This unique ability is not supported by most
enterprise LANs, which rely primarily on DiffServ-like technologies that
distinguish among traffic classes rather than customers. We first show that
this mismatch in QoS between the 5G network and the LAN affects the accuracy of
insights from the LAN-resident analytics applications. We systematically
analyze the root causes of the QoS mismatch and propose a first-of-a-kind
5G-LAN orchestrator (5GLoR). 5GLoR is a middleware that applications can use to
preserve the QoS of their 5G data streams through the enterprise LAN. 5GLoR
periodically analyzes the status of the queues, provides suitable DSCP
identifiers to the application, and installs relevant switch re-write rules (to
change DSCP identifiers between switches) to continuously preserve the QoS of
the 5G data through the LAN. 5GLoR improves the RTP frame level delay and
inter-frame delay by 212\% and 122\%, respectively, for the WebRTC application.
Additionally, with 5GLoR, the accuracy of two example applications (face
detection and recognition) improved by 33\%, while the latency was reduced by
about 25\%. Our experiments show that the performance (accuracy and latency) of
applications on a 5G-LAN performs well with the proposed 5GLoR compared to the
same applications on MEC. This is significant because 5G-LAN offers an order of
magnitude more computing, networking, and storage resources to the applications

reduces the dimension of nonlinear systems in a manner that accounts for either
open- or closed-loop observability and controllability aspects of the system.
Two computational challenges have so far prevented its deployment on
large-scale systems: (a) the energy functions required for characterization of
controllability and observability are solutions of high-dimensional
Hamilton-Jacobi-(Bellman) equations, which have been computationally
intractable and (b) the transformations to construct the reduced-order models
(ROMs) are potentially ill-conditioned and the resulting ROMs are difficult to
simulate on the nonlinear balanced manifolds. Part~1 of this two-part article
addressed challenge (a) via a scalable tensor-based method to solve for
polynomial approximations of the open- and closed-loop energy functions. This
article, (Part~2), addresses challenge (b) by presenting a novel and scalable
method to reduce the dimensionality of the full-order model via model reduction
on polynomially-nonlinear balanced manifolds. The associated nonlinear state
transformation simultaneously 'diagonalizes' relevant energy functions in the
new coordinates. Since this nonlinear balancing transformation can be
ill-conditioned and expensive to evaluate, inspired by the linear case we
develop a computationally efficient balance-and-reduce strategy, resulting in a
scalable and better conditioned truncated transformation to produce balanced
nonlinear ROMs. The algorithm is demonstrated on a semi-discretized partial
differential equation, namely Burgers equation, which illustrates that
higher-degree transformations can improve the accuracy of ROM outputs.

to PPE to improve its prevention capability, especially after prolonged usage.
However, antimicrobial coating by traditional methods, such as chemical vapor
deposition, spraying, and slurry coating, suffers from drawbacks such as low
efficiency, poor coverage, and loose adhesion to PPE. To overcome these
limitations, this work adopted an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique to
deposit a zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film (~ 312.8 nm thick) as an antimicrobial
coating and proved its advantage for depositing uniform ZnO coating on PPE with
a fabric structure. Analysis by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the crystal structure and chemical
composition of the ALD-ZnO. Ultraviolet-visible spectra disclosed a high
absorption level of about 4.8 from 200 nm to 380 nm wavelength for ALD-ZnO, in
contrast to 3.8 for commercial ZnO powders. Moreover, the ALD-ZnO exhibited
strong antimicrobial properties when tested against Escherichia coli (E.Coli)
in contrast to the control and bare glass samples. The colony-forming unit
(CFU/ml) remained zero for all ALD-ZnO samples while varying between 2.30*109

3.27*109 with a median of 2.04x 109 for the bare glass. Statistic analysis
using null-hypothesis significance testing revealed that the calculated P
value, between bare glass and control, ALD-ZnO and control, and bare glass and
control, were all smaller than 0.0001 and significantly smaller than 0.05 alpha

clockwise stellar disk with 18 candidate stars, as has been proposed before,
but with an improved disk membership; a second, almost edge-on plane of 10
candidate stars oriented East-West on the sky that includes at least one IRS 13
star. We estimate the eccentricity distribution of each sub-structure and find
that the clockwise disk has <$e$> = 0.39 and the edge-on plane has <$e$> =
0.68. We also perform simulations of each disk/plane with incompleteness and
spatially-variable extinction to search for asymmetry. Our results show that
the clockwise stellar disk is consistent with a uniform azimuthal distribution
within the disk. The edge-on plane has an asymmetry that cannot be explained by
variable extinction or incompleteness in the field. The orientation, asymmetric
stellar distribution, and high eccentricity of the edge-on plane members
suggest that this structure may be a stream associated with the IRS 13 group.
The complex dynamical structure of the young nuclear cluster indicates that the
star formation process involved complex gas structures and dynamics and is
inconsistent with a single massive gaseous disk.

deviations from the temporal patterns from majority of historical observations.
In multivariate time series, anomalies also refer to abnormal changes in the

have been able to model such inter-series relationships through graph neural
networks. However, most works settle on learning a static graph globally or
within a context window to assist a time series forecasting task or a
reconstruction task, whose objective is not tailored to explicitly detect the
abnormal relationship. Some other works detect anomalies based on
reconstructing or forecasting a list of inter-series graphs, which
inadvertently weakens their power to capture temporal patterns within the data

multivariate time series anomaly detection framework based upon a list of
dynamic inter-series graphs. The core idea is to detect anomalies based on the
deviation of inter-series relationships and intra-series temporal patterns from
normal to anomalous states, by leveraging the evolving nature of the graphs in

simultaneously. Our numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate

function, the inference of its derivatives will often be just as important as

Integrated Wiener's Process (IWP), is considered. Methods for constructing a
finite element (FEM) approximation of an IWP exist but have focused only on the
order $p = 2$ case which does not allow appropriate inference for derivatives,
and their computational feasibility relies on additional approximation to the
FEM itself. In this article, we propose an alternative FEM approximation,
called overlapping splines (O-spline), which pursues computational feasibility
directly through the choice of test functions, and mirrors the construction of
an IWP as the Ospline results from the multiple integrations of these same test
functions. The O-spline approximation applies for any order $p \in
\mathbb{Z}^+$, is computationally efficient and provides consistent inference
for all derivatives up to order $p-1$. It is shown both theoretically, and
empirically through simulation, that the O-spline approximation converges to
the true IWP as the number of knots increases. We further provide a unified and
interpretable way to define priors for the smoothing parameter based on the
notion of predictive standard deviation (PSD), which is invariant to the order
$p$ and the placement of the knot. Finally, we demonstrate the practical use of
the O-spline approximation through simulation studies and an analysis of COVID

downstream data as it is present only in pretraining but not in fine-tuning. In
this work, we offer a new perspective on the consequence of such a discrepancy:
We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that MLM pretraining allocates
some model dimensions exclusively for representing $\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens,
resulting in a representation deficiency for real tokens and limiting the
pretrained model's expressiveness when it is adapted to downstream data without
$\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens. Motivated by the identified issue, we propose MAE-LM,
which pretrains the Masked Autoencoder architecture with MLM where
$\texttt{[MASK]}$ tokens are excluded from the encoder. Empirically, we show
that MAE-LM improves the utilization of model dimensions for real token

Knowledge Graph (KG) embedding represents KGs in a continuous vector space,

combination, federated KG embedding can fully take advantage of knowledge
learned from different clients while preserving the privacy of local data.
However, realistic problems such as data heterogeneity and knowledge forgetting
still remain to be concerned. In this paper, we propose FedLU, a novel FL
framework for heterogeneous KG embedding learning and unlearning. To cope with
the drift between local optimization and global convergence caused by data
heterogeneity, we propose mutual knowledge distillation to transfer local
knowledge to global, and absorb global knowledge back. Moreover, we present an
unlearning method based on cognitive neuroscience, which combines retroactive
interference and passive decay to erase specific knowledge from local clients
and propagate to the global model by reusing knowledge distillation. We
construct new datasets for assessing realistic performance of the
state-of-the-arts. Extensive experiments show that FedLU achieves superior
results in both link prediction and knowledge forgetting.

pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. The semantic information contained in the
original images can be well preserved, and the augmented images still maintain
diversity. Experimental results show that SIP can improve two commonly used
backbones, i.e., ResNet-50 and ViT, by 12.60% and 2.07% on average over seven

more compact. A Cross Inter-Identity Instances module (InterX) involves hard

possible to obtain the optimal solutions simultaneously for different

parametric surrogate models for the control, adjoint and state functions to get

training is done, parameter-specific optimal solutions can be quickly computed
through the forward propagation of the neural networks, which may be further
used for analyzing the parametric properties of the optimal solutions. The

experiments with problems involving various types of parameters.

propsoed MOMA framework. : (1) Distill pre-trained MoCo to MAE. (2) Distill
pre-trained MAE to MoCo (3) Distill pre-trained MoCo and MAE to a random
initialized student. During the distillation, the teacher and the student are
fed with original inputs and masked inputs, respectively. The learning is
enabled by aligning the normalized representations from the teacher and the
projected representations from the student. This simple design leads to
efficient computation with extremely high mask ratio and dramatically reduced
training epochs, and does not require extra considerations on the distillation
target. The experiments show MOMA delivers compact student models with
comparable performance to existing state-of-the-art methods, combining the
power of both self-supervised learning paradigms. It presents competitive
results against different benchmarks in computer vision. We hope our method
provides an insight on transferring and adapting the knowledge from large-scale
pre-trained models in a computationally efficient way.

to the unique properties of low power consumption and high-speed computing on

has shown the equivalent level of performance as ANNs on large-scale datasets.
However, unevenness error, which refers to the deviation caused by different
temporal sequences of spike arrival on activation layers, has not been
effectively resolved and seriously suffers the performance of SNNs under the
condition of short time-steps. In this paper, we make a detailed analysis of
unevenness error and divide it into four categories. We point out that the case
of the ANN output being zero while the SNN output being larger than zero
accounts for the largest percentage. Based on this, we theoretically prove the
sufficient and necessary conditions of this case and propose an optimization
strategy based on residual membrane potential to reduce unevenness error. The
experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets. For example, we
reach top-1 accuracy of 64.32\% on ImageNet with 10-steps. To the best of our

high accuracy and ultra-low-latency on the complex dataset. Code is available

together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering

reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater

how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and

The 2D subthreshold transistor (2D-ST) is carefully designed to operate under
low-current subthreshold regime. Carrier transport has been modelled via
over-the-barrier thermionic and Fowler-Nordheim contact barrier tunnelling
currents over a wide range of gate and drain biases. Simulation of a neuron

high energy efficiency of ~3.5 pJ/spike and biomimetic class-I as well as

However, directly modeling transaction networks using graph neural models

off-the-shelf graph neural networks (GNN). Secondly, a crucial problem in FRM
scenarios like anti-money laundering (AML) is to identify risky transactions
and is most naturally cast into an edge classification problem with rich

that follows node-centric message passing protocols. In this paper, we present
a systematic investigation of design aspects of neural models over directed

proposing an enhancement that targets edge-related tasks using a novel message

integral of the Euler-Poincar\`e density. Our analysis exploits the relation
between this theory and the conformal anomaly action, which allows to uncover
some interesting features of the GB vertex at cubic and quartic level. If we
introduce a conformal decomposition of the metric, the resulting theory can be
formulated in two different versions, which are regularization dependent, a
local one which is quartic in the dilaton field, and a nonlocal one, with a
quadratic dilaton. The nonlocal version is derived by a finite redefinition of
the GB density with the inclusion of a $(d-4)R^2$ correction, before performing
the singular $d\to 4$ limit. In the local version of the theory, we show how
the independent dynamics of the metric and of the dilaton are interwinded by a
classical trace identity. Three-gravitational wave interactions can be
organised in a nontrivial way by using directly the nonlocal 4d EGB version of
the theory. This is possible thanks to the consistency of such formulation -
only up to 3-point functions - directly inherited from the conformal anomaly
(Riegert) action. The constraints satisfied by the vertices are classical,
hierarchical Ward identities. At quartic level, similar relations are derived,
borrowing from the analysis of the counterterms of the 4T correlators of the
conformal anomaly action, as defined by a perturbative expansion. For $d\neq 4$
these constraints hold also for Lovelock actions. They can be extended to
higher order topological invariants in such class of theories.

outcomes to estimate effects of short-term (e.g., daily) exposures that are
available at increasingly fine spatial resolutions. However, areal averages are
typically used to derive population-level exposure, which cannot capture the
spatial variation and individual heterogeneity in exposures that may occur
within the spatial and temporal unit of interest (e.g., within day or ZIP
code). We propose a general modeling approach to incorporate within-unit
exposure heterogeneity in health analyses via exposure quantile functions.
Furthermore, by viewing the exposure quantile function as a functional
covariate, our approach provides additional flexibility in characterizing
associations at different quantile levels. We apply the proposed approach to an
analysis of air pollution and emergency department (ED) visits in Atlanta over
four years. The analysis utilizes daily ZIP code-level distributions of
personal exposures to four traffic-related ambient air pollutants simulated
from the Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulator. Our analyses find that
effects of carbon monoxide on respiratory and cardiovascular disease ED visits
are more pronounced with changes in lower quantiles of the population-level
exposure. Software for implement is provided in the R package nbRegQF.

a personalized graph signal processing (PGSP) method for collaborative

Secondly, we devise a mixed-frequency graph filter to introduce useful

combining an ideal low-pass filter that smooths signals globally and a linear
low-pass filter that smooths signals locally. Finally, we combine the

by systems possessing parity-time (PT) symmetry, where the energy spectrum
remains entirely real in the unbroken PT phase while a transition to complex

the method takes into account the effect of high-dimensional vectors on the

generate a more efficient semantic vector representation. After experimental

research problem in the realm of visual reasoning. A VCR model generally aims
at answering a textual question regarding an image, followed by the rationale
prediction for the preceding answering process. Though these two processes are
sequential and intertwined, existing methods always consider them as two
independent matching-based instances. They, therefore, ignore the pivotal
relationship between the two processes, leading to sub-optimal model
performance. This paper presents a novel visual attention alignment method to
efficaciously handle these two processes in a unified framework. To achieve
this, we first design a re-attention module for aggregating the vision
attention map produced in each process. Thereafter, the resultant two sets of
attention maps are carefully aligned to guide the two processes to make
decisions based on the same image regions. We apply this method to both
conventional attention and the recent Transformer models and carry out

that with the attention alignment module, our method achieves a considerable

distinguish low-contrast tissues. The proposed contrastive embedding space can
make up for the poor representation of the conventionally-used gray space.

similar to that explored experimentally by Maxworthy [\textit{J. Fluid Mech.},

especially the internal characteristics of the Taylor columns that form ahead
of and behind the body and the inertial wave pattern, and determine the drag
and torque acting on the sphere. Torque variations are found to obey two
markedly different laws under rapid- and slow-rotation conditions,
respectively. The corresponding scaling laws are predicted by examining the
dominant balances governing the axial vorticity distribution in the body
vicinity. Results for the drag agree well with the semi-empirical law proposed
for inertialess regimes by Tanzosh \& Stone [\textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 275,

effects are large, provided rotation effects are also large enough. Influence
of axial confinement is shown to increase dramatically the drag in rapidly
rotating configurations, and the container length has to be approximately a
thousand times larger than the sphere for this influence to become negligibly
small. The reported simulations establish that this confinement effect is at
the origin of the long-standing discrepancy existing between Maxworthy's

estimation of ore control block models with little or no attention given to how
the materials are being excavated from the ground. In the process of loading
trucks, the underlying variability of the individual bucket load will determine
the variability of truck payload. Hence, accurate material movement demands a
good knowledge of the excavation process and the buckets interaction with the
environment. However, equipment frequently goes into off nominal states due to
unexpected delays, disturbances or faults. The large amount of such
disturbances causes information loss that reduces the statistical power and
biases estimates, leading to increased uncertainty in the production. A
reliable method that inferences the missing knowledge about the interaction
between the machine and the environment from the available data sources, is
vital to accurately model the material movement. In this study, a twostep
method was implemented that performed unsupervised clustering and then
predicted the missing information. The first method is DBSCAN based spatial
clustering which divides the diggers and buckets positional data into connected
loading segments. Clear patterns of segmented bucket dig positions were
observed. The second model utilized Gaussian process regression which was
trained with the clustered data and the model was then used to infer the mean
locations of the test clusters. Bucket dig locations were then simulated at the
inferred mean locations for different durations and compared against the known
bucket dig locations. This method was tested at an open pit mine in the Pilbara
of Western Australia. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed
method in inferencing the missing information of bucket environment
interactions and therefore enables miners to continuously track the material

Organizations widely use spectral clustering algorithms to find clustering in

challenging due to computational overhead. While the distributed spectral
clustering algorithm exists, they face the problem of data privacy and
increased communication costs between the clients. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a spectral clustering algorithm using federated learning (FL) to
overcome these issues. FL is a privacy-protecting algorithm that accumulates
model parameters from each local learner rather than collecting users' raw
data, thus providing both scalability and data privacy. We developed two
approaches: FedSpectral and FedSpectral+. FedSpectral is a baseline approach
that uses local spectral clustering labels to aggregate the global spectral
clustering by creating a similarity graph. FedSpectral+, a state-of-the-art
approach, uses the power iteration method to learn the global spectral
embedding by incorporating the entire graph data without access to the raw
information distributed among the clients. We further designed our own
similarity metric to check the clustering quality of the distributed approach
to that of the original/non-FL clustering. The proposed approach FedSpectral+
obtained a similarity of 98.85% and 99.8%, comparable to that of global

Here, we propose a learning system, where patterns are defined within the realm

networks and symbolic dynamics. A particular way for combining these approaches

framework has been to consider mapping symbolic dynamics onto neurodynamics,
represented as neural automata. This representation theory, enables us to ask
questions, such as, how does the brain implement Turing computations.
Specifically, in this representation theory, neural automata result from the
assignment of symbols and symbol strings to numbers, known as G\""odel encoding.
Under this assignment symbolic computation becomes represented by trajectories
of state vectors in a real phase space, that allows for statistical correlation
analyses with real-world measurements and experimental data. However, these
assignments are usually completely arbitrary. Hence, it makes sense to address
the problem question of, which aspects of the dynamics observed under such a
representation is intrinsic to the dynamics and which are not. In this study,
we develop a formally rigorous mathematical framework for the investigation of
symmetries and invariants of neural automata under different encodings. As a
central concept we define patterns of equality for such systems. We consider
different macroscopic observables, such as the mean activation level of the
neural network, and ask for their invariance properties. Our main result shows
that only step functions that are defined over those patterns of equality are
invariant under recodings, while the mean activation is not. Our work could be
of substantial importance for related regression studies of real-world
measurements with neurosymbolic processors for avoiding confounding results
that are dependant on a particular encoding and not intrinsic to the dynamics.

As a promising solution, content-based generative models usually project a

collaborative signals from item content so that collaborative filtering can be
applied. However, since the training of the cold-start recommendation models is
conducted on warm datasets, the existent methods face the issue that the
collaborative embeddings of items will be blurred, which significantly
degenerates the performance of cold-start item recommendation. To address this

Cold-start item Recommendation (CCFCRec), which capitalizes on the
co-occurrence collaborative signals in warm training data to alleviate the

indirectly transferred to the content CF module, so that the blurry
collaborative embeddings can be rectified implicitly by the memorized

recent years. Solving such an ill-posed problem generally requires to explore
intrinsic prior structures underlying tensor data, and formulate them as
certain forms of regularization terms for guiding a sound estimate of the
restored tensor. Recent research have made significant progress by adopting two
insightful tensor priors, i.e., global low-rankness (L) and local smoothness
(S) across different tensor modes, which are always encoded as a sum of two
separate regularization terms into the recovery models. However, unlike the
primary theoretical developments on low-rank tensor recovery, these joint L+S
models have no theoretical exact-recovery guarantees yet, making the methods
lack reliability in real practice. To this crucial issue, in this work, we
build a unique regularization term, which essentially encodes both L and S
priors of a tensor simultaneously. Especially, by equipping this single
regularizer into the recovery models, we can rigorously prove the exact
recovery guarantees for two typical tensor recovery tasks, i.e., tensor
completion (TC) and tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA). To the
best of our knowledge, this should be the first exact-recovery results among
all related L+S methods for tensor recovery. Significant recovery accuracy
improvements over many other SOTA methods in several TC and TRPCA tasks with
various kinds of visual tensor data are observed in extensive experiments.
Typically, our method achieves a workable performance when the missing rate is
extremely large, e.g., 99.5%, for the color image inpainting task, while all
its peers totally fail in such challenging case.

the data generated by different location infrastructures, which can deliver
improve the sensing range and detection robustness. Unfortunately, existing
calibration algorithms often assume that the LiDARs are significantly
overlapped or that the temporal calibration is already achieved. Since these
assumptions do not always hold in the real world, the calibration results from
the existing algorithms are often unsatisfactory and always need human
involvement, which brings high labor costs. In this paper, we propose TrajMatch
-- the first system that can automatically calibrate for roadside LiDARs in

based on the result of the detection/tracking task instead of extracting
special features. More deeply, we propose a mechanism for evaluating
calibration parameters that is consistent with our algorithm, and we
demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme experimentally, which can also be
used to guide parameter iterations for multiple calibration. Finally, to
evaluate the performance of TrajMatch , we collect two dataset, one simulated

TrajMatch can achieve a spatial calibration error of less than 10cm and a

Existing literature has identified privacy risks targeting machine learning
models, including membership inference, model inversion, and model extraction
attacks. Depending on the settings and parties involved, such attacks may
target either the model itself or the training data used to create the model.
  We have identified that tools providing XAI can particularly increase the
vulnerability of model extraction attacks, which can be a significant issue
when the owner of an AI model prefers to provide only black-box access rather
than sharing the model parameters and architecture with other parties. To
explore this privacy risk, we propose AUTOLYCUS, a model extraction attack that
leverages the explanations provided by popular explainable AI tools. We
particularly focus on white-box machine learning (ML) models such as decision
trees and logistic regression models.
  We have evaluated the performance of AUTOLYCUS on 5 machine learning

target model. We observe that the proposed attack is highly effective; it
requires up to 60x fewer queries to the target model compared to the
state-of-the-art attack, while providing comparable accuracy and similarity. We
first validate the performance of the proposed algorithm on decision trees, and
then show its performance on logistic regression models as an indicator that
the proposed algorithm performs well on white-box ML models in general.

astereoseismology, both from theoretical and observational aspects. As
predicted by the theory of weak nonlinear interactions between resonant modes,
their amplitude and frequency can be modulated according to various kinds of
patterns. However, those subtle modulations could hardly be well characterized
from ground-based photometric monitoring. The {\sl Kepler} spacecraft offered a
new window to find clear-cut evidence of well-determined amplitude and
frequency modulations, leading to the first discoveries of such variations in
pulsating white dwarf and hot B subdwarf stars. Following that direction, a
systematic survey of oscillation mode properties in compact pulsators monitored
by {\sl Kepler} suggests that mode variability is likely a common phenomenon,
which remain unaccounted for by standard linear non-radial pulsation theory. To
reach this conclusion firmly, the survey has now been extended to a larger
context including compact stars observed by K2 and TESS. We expect that this
extended survey will help to constrain key parameters governing weak nonlinear
effects in stellar oscillations.

with non-Gaussian uncertainties in isolated microgrids, this paper proposes a
chance constrained stability constrained optimal power flow (CC-SC-OPF) model.
Firstly, we propose a bi-level optimization problem, of which the upper level
aims to minimize the expected generation cost without violating the stability
chance constraint; the lower level concerns about the stability index given by
a semi-definite program (SDP). Secondly, we apply the Gaussian mixture model
(GMM) to handle the non-Gaussian RES uncertainties and introduce analytical
sensitivity analysis to reformulate chance constraints with respect to
stability index and operational variables into linear deter-ministic versions.
By incorporating linearized constraints, the bi-level model can be efficiently
solved by Benders decomposition-based approach. Thirdly, we design a
supplementary corrective countermeasure to compensate the possible control
error caused by the linear approximation. Simulation results on the 33-bus
microgrid reveal that compared to benchmarking approaches, the proposed model
converges 30 times faster with more accurate solutions.

role in engineering computations which require repeated evaluations of
structural responses, such as structural optimization and probabilistic
analysis. To improve the efficiency of engineering computations, a novel
approximate static reanalysis method based on system reduction and iterative
solution is proposed for statically indeterminate structures with high-rank
modification. In this approach, a statically indeterminate structure is divided
into the basis system and the additional components. Subsequently, the
structural equilibrium equations are rewritten as the equation system with the
stiffness matrix of the basis system and the pseudo forces derived from the
additional elements. With the introduction of spectral decomposition, a reduced
equation system with the element forces of the additional elements as the
unknowns is established. Then, the approximate solutions of the modified
structure can be obtained by solving the reduced equation system through a
pre-conditioned iterative solution algorithm. The computational costs of the
proposed method and the other two reanalysis methods are compared and numerical
examples including static reanalysis and static nonlinear analysis are
presented. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent
computational performance for both the structures with homogeneous material and
structures composed of functionally graded beams. Meanwhile, the superiority of
the proposed method indicates that the combination of system reduction and
pre-conditioned iterative solution technology is an effective way to develop
high-performance reanalysis methods.

valuable products. The toolbox to optimize bioprocesses includes
\textit{extracellular} process elements such as the bioreactor design and mode

However, these elements are frequently insufficient for achieving optimal
process performance or precise product composition. One can use metabolic and
genetic engineering methods for optimization at the intracellular level.
Nevertheless, those are often of static nature, failing when applied to dynamic
processes or if disturbances occur. Furthermore, many bioprocesses are
optimized empirically and implemented with little-to-no feedback control to
counteract disturbances. The concept of cybergenetics has opened new
possibilities to optimize bioprocesses by enabling online modulation of the
gene expression of metabolism-relevant proteins via external inputs (e.g.,
light intensity in optogenetics). Here, we fuse cybergenetics with model-based
optimization and predictive control for optimizing dynamic bioprocesses. To do
so, we propose to use dynamic constraint-based models that integrate the
dynamics of metabolic reactions, resource allocation, and inducible gene
expression. We formulate a model-based optimal control problem to find the
optimal process inputs. Furthermore, we propose using model predictive control
to address uncertainties via online feedback. We focus on fed-batch processes,
where the substrate feeding rate is an additional optimization variable. As a
simulation example, we show the optogenetic control of the ATPase enzyme
complex for dynamic modulation of enforced ATP wasting to adjust product yield

detecting small exoplanets via transit photometry. Since this activity is
enhanced in young stars, traditional filtering algorithms may severely
under-perform in detecting such exoplanets.
  Aims.This paper aims to compare the relative performances of four algorithms
developed by independent research groups specifically for the filtering of
activity in the light curves (LCs) of young active stars, prior to the search
for planetary transit signals: Notch and LOCoR(N&L), Young Stars
Detrending(YSD), K2 Systematics Correction(K2SC) and VARLET. We include in the
comparison also the two best-performing algorithms implemented in Wotan, namely
the Tukey's biweight and the Huber Spline.
  Methods. We performed a series of injection-retrieval tests of planetary
transits of different types, from Jupiter down to Earth-sized planets, moving
both on circular and eccentric orbits. The tests were carried out over 100
simulated LCs of both quiet and active solar-like stars that will be observed
by the ESA space telescope PLATO.
  Results. We found that N&L is the best choice in many cases, since it misses
the lowest number of transits. However, it under-performs if the planetary
orbital period closely matches the stellar rotation period, especially in the
case of small planets for which the biweight and VARLET algorithms work better.
For LCs with a large number of data, the combined results of YSD and Huber
Spline yield the highest recovery percentage. Filtering algorithms allow us to
get a very precise estimate of the orbital period and the mid-transit time of
the detected planets, while the planet-to-star radius is under-estimated most
of the time, especially in the case of grazing transits or eccentric orbits. A

  Representations (ICLR 2023)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Moire patterns appear frequently when taking photos of digital screens,
drastically degrading the image quality. Despite the advance of CNNs in image
demoireing, existing networks are with heavy design, causing redundant
computation burden for mobile devices. In this paper, we launch the first study
on accelerating demoireing networks and propose a dynamic demoireing
acceleration method (DDA) towards a real-time deployment on mobile devices. Our
stimulus stems from a simple-yet-universal fact that moire patterns often
unbalancedly distribute across an image. Consequently, excessive computation is
wasted upon non-moire areas. Therefore, we reallocate computation costs in
proportion to the complexity of image patches. In order to achieve this aim, we
measure the complexity of an image patch by designing a novel moire prior that
considers both colorfulness and frequency information of moire patterns. Then,
we restore image patches with higher-complexity using larger networks and the
ones with lower-complexity are assigned with smaller networks to relieve the
computation burden. At last, we train all networks in a parameter-shared
supernet paradigm to avoid additional parameter burden. Extensive experiments
on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed DDA. In
addition, the acceleration evaluated on the VIVO X80 Pro smartphone equipped
with a chip of Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 shows that our method can drastically reduce
the inference time, leading to a real-time image demoireing on mobile devices.

disorder that limits the life of the patient, although early prognosis of HD

methods include using a variety of complex biomarkers such as clinical and
imaging factors, however these methods have many shortfalls, such as their
resource demand and failure to distinguish symptomatic and asymptomatic
patients. Quantitative biomedical signaling has been used for diagnosis of
other neurological disorders such as schizophrenia and has potential for
exposing abnormalities in HD patients. Methodology: In this project, we used a
premade, certified dataset collected at a clinic with 27 HD positive patients,
36 controls, and 6 unknowns with electroencephalography, electrocardiography,
and functional near-infrared spectroscopy data. We first preprocessed the data
and extracted a variety of features from both the transformed and raw signals,
after which we applied a plethora of shallow machine learning techniques.
Results: We found the highest accuracy was achieved by a scaled-out Extremely
Randomized Trees algorithm, with area under the curve of the receiver operator
characteristic of 0.963 and accuracy of 91.353%. The subsequent feature
analysis showed that 60.865% of the features had p<0.05, with the features from
the raw signal being most significant. Conclusion: The results indicate the
promise of neural and cardiac signals for marking abnormalities in HD, as well
as evaluating the progression of the disease in patients.

envisioned to greatly increase traffic efficiency and reduce congestion. Deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach to adaptively control
traffic lights based on the real-time traffic situation in a road network.
However, conventional methods may suffer from poor scalability. In this paper,
we investigate deep reinforcement learning to control traffic lights, and both
theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that the intelligent
behavior ``greenwave"" (i.e., a vehicle will see a progressive cascade of green
lights, and not have to brake at any intersection) emerges naturally a grid
road network, which is proved to be the optimal policy in an avenue with
multiple cross streets. As a first step, we use two DRL algorithms for the
traffic light control problems in two scenarios. In a single road intersection,
we verify that the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm delivers a thresholding
policy; and in a grid road network, we adopt the deep deterministic policy
gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Secondly, numerical experiments show that the DQN
algorithm delivers the optimal control, and the DDPG algorithm with passive
observations has the capability to produce on its own a high-level intelligent
behavior in a grid road network, namely, the ``greenwave"" policy emerges. We
also verify the ``greenwave"" patterns in a $5 \times 10$ grid road network.
Thirdly, the ``greenwave"" patterns demonstrate that DRL algorithms produce
favorable solutions since the ``greenwave"" policy shown in experiment results
is proved to be optimal in a specified traffic model (an avenue with multiple
cross streets). The delivered policies both in a single road intersection and a
grid road network demonstrate the scalability of DRL algorithms.

distribution of the input image space rather than assuming no prior information
about the distribution. This allows it to classify similar samples close to
each other in the latent space's distribution. VAEs classically assume the
latent space is normally distributed, though many distribution priors work, and
they encode this assumption through a K-L divergence term in the loss function.
While VAEs learn the distribution of the latent space and naturally make each
dimension in the latent space as disjoint from the others as possible, they do
not group together similar features -- the image space feature represented by
one unit of the representation layer does not necessarily have high correlation
with the feature represented by a neighboring unit of the representation layer.
This makes it difficult to interpret VAEs since the representation layer is not
structured in a way that is easy for humans to parse. We aim to make a more
interpretable VAE by partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets
of units. Partitioning the representation layer into disjoint sets of
interconnected units yields a prior that features of the input space to this
new VAE, which we call a partition VAE or PVAE, are grouped together by
correlation -- for example, if our image space were the space of all ping ping
game images (a somewhat complex image space we use to test our architecture)
then we would hope the partitions in the representation layer each learned some
large feature of the image like the characteristics of the ping pong table or
the characteristics and position of the players or the ball. We also add to the
PVAE a cost-saving measure: subresolution. Because we do not have access to GPU
training environments for long periods of time and Google Colab Pro costs
money, we attempt to decrease the complexity of the PVAE by outputting an image
with dimensions scaled down from the input image by a constant factor, thus
forcing the model to output a smaller version of the image. We then increase
the resolution to calculate loss and train by interpolating through neighboring
pixels. We train a tuned PVAE on MNIST and Sports10 to test its effectiveness.

higher throughput and energy efficiency than their electronic counterparts, the

aims to fulfill this need. For that, we invent a single-MRR-based optical XNOR

how such systems can communicate with each other about the surrounding world,
despite their different architectures and training regimes. As a first step in
this direction, we systematically explore the task of referential communication
in a community of state-of-the-art pre-trained visual networks, showing that
they can develop a shared protocol to refer to a target image among a set of
candidates. Such shared protocol, induced in a self-supervised way, can to some
extent be used to communicate about previously unseen object categories, as
well as to make more granular distinctions compared to the categories taught to
the original networks. Contradicting a common view in multi-agent emergent
communication research, we find that imposing a discrete bottleneck on
communication hampers the emergence of a general code. Moreover, we show that a
new neural network can learn the shared protocol developed in a community with
remarkable ease, and the process of integrating a new agent into a community
more stably succeeds when the original community includes a larger set of
heterogeneous networks. Finally, we illustrate the independent benefits of
developing a shared communication layer by using it to directly transfer an
object classifier from a network to another, and we qualitatively and
quantitatively study its emergent properties.

data, models or users. Such behaviors, whether triggered by omission or
commission, lead to trust issues when AI works with humans. The current
approach of assessing AI services in a black box setting, where the consumer
does not have access to the AI's source code or training data, is limited. The
consumer has to rely on the AI developer's documentation and trust that the
system has been built as stated. Further, if the AI consumer reuses the service
to build other services which they sell to their customers, the consumer is at
the risk of the service providers (both data and model providers). Our
approach, in this context, is inspired by the success of nutritional labeling
in food industry to promote health and seeks to assess and rate AI services for
trust from the perspective of an independent stakeholder. The ratings become a
means to communicate the behavior of AI systems so that the consumer is
informed about the risks and can make an informed decision. In this paper, we
will first describe recent progress in developing rating methods for text-based
machine translator AI services that have been found promising with user
studies. Then, we will outline challenges and vision for a principled,
multi-modal, causality-based rating methodologies and its implication for
decision-support in real-world scenarios like health and food recommendation.

quantum mechanics, a new quantum postulate is suggested in order to restore
classical locality and causality to quantum physics: only the relative
coordinates between detected quantum events are valid observables. This
postulate supports the EPR view that quantum mechanics is incomplete, while
also staying compatible to the Bohr view that nothing exists beyond the
quantum. The new postulate follows from a more general principle of quantum
relativity, which states that only correlations between experimental detections
of quantum events have a real classical existence. Quantum relativity provides
a framework to differentiate the quantum and classical world.

rooted in ensemble theory. By ensemble theory, the variation of the system's
microscopic state is indicated by the moving of the phase point, and the moving
trajectory is believed continuous. Thus, the ensemble density is thought to be
a smooth function, and it observes continuity equation. When the Hamiltonian
canonical equations of the molecules are applied to the continuity equation,
Liouville equation can be obtained. We carefully analyze a gas composed of a
great number of molecules colliding with each other. The defects in deriving
Liouville equation are found. Due to collision, molecules' momenta changes
discontinuously, so that the trajectories of the phase points are actually not
continuous. In statistical mechanics, infinitesimals in physics and in
mathematics should be distinguished. In continuity equation that the ensemble
density satisfies, the derivatives with respect to space and time should be
physical infinitesimals, while in Hamiltonian canonical equations that every
molecule follows, the derivatives take infinitesimals in mathematics. In the
course of deriving Liouville equation, the infinitesimals in physics are
unknowingly replaced by those in mathematics. The conclusion is that Liouville
equation is not applicable to gases.

reconstruct and predict the evolution of unmeasured variables in a chaotic
system. The training is constrained by a regularization term, which penalizes
solutions that violate the system's governing equations. The network is
showcased on the Lorenz-96 model, a prototypical chaotic dynamical system, for
a varying number of variables to reconstruct. First, we show the PI-LSTM
architecture and explain how to constrain the differential equations, which is
a non-trivial task in LSTMs. Second, the PI-LSTM is numerically evaluated in
the long-term autonomous evolution to study its ergodic properties. We show
that it correctly predicts the statistics of the unmeasured variables, which
cannot be achieved without the physical constraint. Third, we compute the
Lyapunov exponents of the network to infer the key stability properties of the
chaotic system. For reconstruction purposes, adding the physics-informed loss
qualitatively enhances the dynamical behaviour of the network, compared to a
data-driven only training. This is quantified by the agreement of the Lyapunov
exponents. This work opens up new opportunities for state reconstruction and
learning of the dynamics of nonlinear systems.

this practice is challenging because few are regularly inspected. We developed
a positive-unlabeled learning algorithm using vessel characteristics and
movement patterns to estimate an upper bound of the number of positive cases of
forced labor, with the goal of helping make accurate, responsible, and fair
decisions. 89% of the reported cases of forced labor were correctly classified
as positive (recall) while 98% of the vessels certified as having decent
working conditions were correctly classified as negative. The recall was high
for vessels from different regions using different gears, except for trawlers.
We found that as much as ~28% of vessels may operate using forced labor, with
the fraction much higher in squid jiggers and longlines. This model could
inform risk-based port inspections as part of a broader monitoring, control,
and surveillance regime to reduce forced labor.

deployed over a realistic wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communication system with digital modulation and over-the-air computation
(AirComp) is studied. In particular, an MIMO system is considered in which edge
devices transmit their local FL models (trained using their locally collected
data) to a parameter server (PS) using beamforming to maximize the number of
devices scheduled for transmission. The PS, acting as a central controller,
generates a global FL model using the received local FL models and broadcasts
it back to all devices. Due to the limited bandwidth in a wireless network,
AirComp is adopted to enable efficient wireless data aggregation. However,
fading of wireless channels can produce aggregate distortions in an
AirComp-based FL scheme. To tackle this challenge, we propose a modified
federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm that combines digital modulation with
AirComp to mitigate wireless fading while ensuring the communication
efficiency. This is achieved by a joint transmit and receive beamforming
design, which is formulated as a optimization problem to dynamically adjust the
beamforming matrices based on current FL model parameters so as to minimize the
transmitting error and ensure the FL performance. To achieve this goal, we
first analytically characterize how the beamforming matrices affect the
performance of the FedAvg in different iterations. Based on this relationship,
an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to estimate the local FL models of
all devices and adjust the beamforming matrices at the PS for future model
transmission. The algorithmic advantages and improved performance of the
proposed methodologies are demonstrated through extensive numerical
experiments.

may support grid decarbonization remains insufficiently studied and hence
contested. We approach this research gap by systematizing both the strengths

that a net-decarbonizing effect led by renewable-based mining is indeed
plausible.

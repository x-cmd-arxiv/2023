topological features in time-varying scalar fields using merge trees and
partial optimal transport. Merge trees are topological descriptors that record
the evolution of connected components in the sublevel sets of scalar fields. We
present a new technique for modeling and comparing merge trees using tools from
partial optimal transport. In particular, we model a merge tree as a measure
network, that is, a network equipped with a probability distribution, and
define a notion of distance on the space of merge trees inspired by partial
optimal transport. Such a distance offers a new and flexible perspective for
encoding intrinsic and extrinsic information in the comparative measures of
merge trees. More importantly, it gives rise to a partial matching between
topological features in time-varying data, thus enabling flexible topology
tracking for scientific simulations. Furthermore, such partial matching may be
interpreted as probabilistic coupling between features at adjacent time steps,
which gives rise to probabilistic tracking graphs. We derive a stability result
for our distance and provide numerous experiments indicating the efficacy of
distance in extracting meaningful feature tracks.

and guarantee the sustainability of its industries is the constant availability
of electricity. This is usually provided by the national electric grid.
However, in developing countries where companies are emerging on a constant
basis including telecommunication industries, those are still experiencing a
non-stable electricity supply. Therefore, they have to rely on generators to
guarantee their full functionality. Those generators depend on fuel to function
and the rate of consumption gets usually high, if not monitored properly.
Monitoring operation is usually carried out by a (non-expert) human. In some
cases, this could be a tedious process, as some companies have reported an
exaggerated high consumption rate. This work proposes a label assisted
autoencoder for anomaly detection in the fuel consumed by power generating
plants. In addition to the autoencoder model, we added a labelling assistance
module that checks if an observation is labelled, the label is used to check
the veracity of the corresponding anomaly classification given a threshold. A
consensus is then reached on whether training should stop or whether the
threshold should be updated or the training should continue with the search for
hyper-parameters. Results show that the proposed model is highly efficient for
reading anomalies with a detection accuracy of $97.20\%$ which outperforms the
existing model of $96.1\%$ accuracy trained on the same dataset. In addition,
the proposed model is able to classify the anomalies according to their degree
of severity.

control strategies and an understanding of the dominant unsteady flow physics

flight in these conditions. To this end, this paper develops and experimentally

the classical unsteady aerodynamic theories of Wagner and Kussner for wings
encountering large-amplitude transverse gusts without a priori knowledge of

generalize to gusts of different strengths and directions, as well as wings at

systems analysis to Wagner's aerodynamic model to reveal the effect of the
pitch-axis location, pitch input, and closed-loop feedback gains on the
stability and robustness of the system along with the flow physics responsible.
The real-time output feedback control strategy is experimentally tested in a

fading channels with various types of channel state information at the
transmitter (CSIT) and receiver (CSIR). The GMI is based on variations of
auxiliary channel models with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and
circularly-symmetric complex Gaussian inputs. One variation uses reverse
channel models with minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimates that give the
largest rates but are challenging to optimize. A second variation uses forward
channel models with linear MMSE estimates that are easier to optimize. Both
model classes are applied to channels where the receiver is unaware of the CSIT
and for which adaptive codewords achieve capacity. The forward model inputs are
chosen as linear functions of the adaptive codeword's entries to simplify the
analysis. For scalar channels, the maximum GMI is then achieved by a
conventional codebook, where the amplitude and phase of each channel symbol are
modified based on the CSIT. The GMI increases by partitioning the channel
output alphabet and using a different auxiliary model for each partition
subset. The partitioning also helps to determine the capacity scaling at high
and low signal-to-noise ratios. A class of power control policies is described
for partial CSIR, including a MMSE policy for full CSIT. Several examples of
fading channels with AWGN illustrate the theory, focusing on on-off fading and
Rayleigh fading. The capacity results generalize to block fading channels with
in-block feedback, including capacity expressions in terms of mutual and
directed information.

both the learning rate and the variance of the randomly initialized network's

results in a better generalization, a behavior also observed for GD. However,
in contrast to GD where larger learning rates lead to the best generalization,

can be excited by large-scale tidal flows in rotating fluid bodies, and excites
inertial waves if the dimensionless tidal amplitude ($\epsilon$) is

turbulent convection have not been studied in this context. We perform an
extensive suite of Cartesian hydrodynamical simulations in wide boxes to
explore the interactions of the elliptical instability and Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection. We find that geostrophic vortices generated by the elliptical
instability dominate the flow, with energies far exceeding those of the
inertial waves. Furthermore, we find that the elliptical instability can
operate with convection, but it is suppressed for sufficiently strong
convection, primarily by convectively-driven large-scale vortices. We examine
the flow in Fourier space, allowing us to determine the energetically dominant
frequencies and wavenumbers. We find that power primarily concentrates in
geostrophic vortices, in wavenumbers that are convectively unstable, and along
the inertial wave dispersion relation, even in non-elliptically deformed
convective flows. Examining linear growth rates on a convective background, we
find that convective large-scale vortices suppress the elliptical instability
in the same way as the geostrophic vortices created by the elliptical
instability itself. Finally, convective motions act as an effective viscosity
on large-scale tidal flows, providing a sustained energy transfer (scaling as
$\epsilon^2$). Furthermore, we find that the energy transfer resulting from
bursts of elliptical instability, when it operates, is consistent with the

great promise in a variety of applications, including image and speech
synthesis, natural language processing, and drug discovery. However, when
applied to engineering design problems, evaluating the performance of these
models can be challenging, as traditional statistical metrics based on
likelihood may not fully capture the requirements of engineering applications.
This paper doubles as a review and a practical guide to evaluation metrics for
deep generative models (DGMs) in engineering design. We first summarize
well-accepted `classic' evaluation metrics for deep generative models grounded
in machine learning theory and typical computer science applications. Using
case studies, we then highlight why these metrics seldom translate well to
design problems but see frequent use due to the lack of established
alternatives. Next, we curate a set of design-specific metrics which have been
proposed across different research communities and can be used for evaluating
deep generative models. These metrics focus on unique requirements in design
and engineering, such as constraint satisfaction, functional performance,
novelty, and conditioning. We structure our review and discussion as a set of
practical selection criteria and usage guidelines. Throughout our discussion,
we apply the metrics to models trained on simple 2-dimensional example
problems. Finally, to illustrate the selection process and classic usage of the
presented metrics, we evaluate three deep generative models on a multifaceted
bicycle frame design problem considering performance target achievement, design
novelty, and geometric constraints. We publicly release the code for the
datasets, models, and metrics used throughout the paper at
decode.mit.edu/projects/metrics/.

of the central problems for deep learning, as relational structures are
pervasive and induce data inter-dependence which hinders trivial adaptation of
existing approaches that assume inputs to be i.i.d.~sampled. However, current
models mostly focus on improving testing performance of in-distribution data
and largely ignore the potential risk w.r.t. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing
samples that may cause negative outcome if the prediction is overconfident on
them. In this paper, we investigate the under-explored problem, OOD detection
on graph-structured data, and identify a provably effective OOD discriminator
based on an energy function directly extracted from graph neural networks
trained with standard classification loss. This paves a way for a simple,
powerful and efficient OOD detection model for GNN-based learning on graphs,
which we call GNNSafe. It also has nice theoretical properties that guarantee
an overall distinguishable margin between the detection scores for
in-distribution and OOD samples, which, more critically, can be further
strengthened by a learning-free energy belief propagation scheme. For
comprehensive evaluation, we introduce new benchmark settings that evaluate the
model for detecting OOD data from both synthetic and real distribution shifts
(cross-domain graph shifts and temporal graph shifts). The results show that
GNNSafe achieves up to $17.0\%$ AUROC improvement over state-of-the-arts and it
could serve as simple yet strong baselines in such an under-developed area.

disintegrated into several fragments in 1995. As a consequence of the nucleus
break-up, possible increased meteor rates were predicted for 2022. On May
30-31, observation networks around the world reported two distinct peaks of TAH
activity, around solar longitudes 69.02{\deg} and 69.42{\deg}. This work
examines the encounter conditions of the Earth with meteoroids ejected from 73P
during the splitting event and on previous perihelion passages. Numerical
simulations suggest that the main peak observed in 2022 was caused by
meteoroids ejected from the splitting nucleus with four times the typical
cometary gas expansion speed. High-resolution measurements performed with the
Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory indicate that these meteoroids are
fragile, with estimated bulk densities of 250 kg/m$^3$. In contrast with the
main peak, the first TAH activity peak in 2022 is best modelled with trails
ejected prior to 1960. We find that ordinary cometary activity could have
produced other TAH apparitions observed in the past, including in 1930 and
2017. The extension of our model to future years predicts significant returns
of the shower in 2033 and 2049.

galaxy identified via the EM counterpart. From the angular separation of the
lensed host galaxy images, as well as its redshift and the (foreground) lens
redshift, we demonstrate that we can predict the time delays assuming a
standard lens model. Encouraged by the non-trivial upper limits on the
detection rates of lensed BNS/NSBH mergers that we estimate for upcoming
observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra and third generation networks, we assess
the feasibility and benefits of our method. To that end, we study the effect of
limited angular resolution of the telescopes on our ability to predict the time
delays. We find that with an angular resolution of $0.05''$, we can predict
time delays of $> 1$ day with $1\sigma$ error-bar of $\mathcal{O}$(hours) at
best. We also construct realistic time delay distributions of detectable lensed
BNSs/NSBHs to forecast the early-warning times we might expect in the observing

stealth configurations within Lovelock gravity theory. The scalar field

Unfortunately, no previous work compared injected and embedded dropout;
therefore, we provide the first thorough investigation, focusing on regression
problems. The main contribution of our work is to provide guidelines on the
effective use of injected dropout so that it can be a practical alternative to
the current use of embedded dropout. In particular, we show that its
effectiveness strongly relies on a suitable scaling of the corresponding
uncertainty measure, and we discuss the trade-off between negative
log-likelihood and calibration error as a function of the scale factor.
Experimental results on UCI data sets and crowd counting benchmarks support our
claim that dropout injection can effectively behave as a competitive post hoc

for real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)
specialize to group shifts and require group information on all training

be overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may
form a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the
real world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training
points). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a
more nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the
true group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may
expect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image
background, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high
accuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that
need not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived

thermoelectric detector (TED) converts a finite temperature difference caused
by the absorption of a single photon into an open circuit thermovoltage.
Designed with feasible parameters, our TED is able to reveal single-photons of
frequency ranging from about 15 GHz to about 150 PHz depending on the chosen
design and materials. In particular, this detector is expected to show values
of signal-to-noise ratio SNR about 15 at {\nu} = 50 GHz when operated at a
temperature of 10 mK. Interestingly, this device can be viewed as a digital
single-photon detector, since it generates an almost constant voltage VS for
the full operation energies. Our TED can reveal single photons in a frequency
range wider than 4 decades with the possibility to discern the energy of the
incident photon by measuring the time persistence of the generated
thermovoltage. Its broadband operation suggests that our TED could find
practical applications in several fields of quantum science and technology,

simulations that explore exotic and novel physics. In this sense, a new phase
transition in the entanglement properties of many-body dynamics has been
described when the unitary evolution is interspersed with measurements, thus
exhibiting universal properties. These measurement-induced phase transitions
can be interpreted as a transition in the purification capabilities or error
correction properties of quantum circuits, which is especially relevant in the
context of state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.
Measurement-induced phase transitions have been realized with quantum devices
based on trapped ions or superconducting circuits, although they require large
amounts of resources, due to the need to post-select trajectories, which
consists of keeping track classically of the outcome of each measurement. In
this work, we first describe the statistical properties of an interacting
transmon array which is repeatedly measured, and predict the behavior of
relevant quantities in the area-law phase using a combination of the replica
method and non-Hermitian perturbation theory. Most importantly, we show that,
by using predetermined measurements that force the system to be locally in a
certain state after performing a measurement, we can make use of the
distribution of the number of bosons measured at a single site as a diagnostic
for a~measurement-induced phase transition. This indicates that the method of
predetermined measurements is a suitable experimental candidate to alleviate
post-selection-related issues. We also show numerically that a transmon array,
modeled by an attractive Bose-Hubbard model, in which local measurements of the
number of bosons are probabilistically interleaved, exhibits a phase transition
in the entanglement entropy properties of the ensemble of trajectories in the
steady state.

inductive bias leads to a phenomenon known as over-squashing, where a node
feature is insensitive to information contained at distant nodes. Despite
recent methods introduced to mitigate this issue, an understanding of the
causes for over-squashing and of possible solutions are lacking. In this
theoretical work, we prove that: (i) Neural network width can mitigate
over-squashing, but at the cost of making the whole network more sensitive;
(ii) Conversely, depth cannot help mitigate over-squashing: increasing the
number of layers leads to over-squashing being dominated by vanishing
gradients; (iii) The graph topology plays the greatest role, since
over-squashing occurs between nodes at high commute (access) time. Our analysis
provides a unified framework to study different recent methods introduced to
cope with over-squashing and serves as a justification for a class of methods
that fall under graph rewiring.

for clinical or industrial use, it is important that these predictions come
with a reliable estimate of their accuracy (uncertainty quantification).
Because models of complex biological systems are always large simplifications,
model discrepancy arises - where a mathematical model fails to recapitulate the
true data generating process. This presents a particular challenge for making
accurate predictions, and especially for making accurate estimates of
uncertainty in these predictions. Experimentalists and modellers must choose
which experimental procedures (protocols) are used to produce data to train
their models. We propose to characterise uncertainty owing to model discrepancy
with an ensemble of parameter sets, each of which results from training to data
from a different protocol. The variability in predictions from this ensemble
provides an empirical estimate of predictive uncertainty owing to model
discrepancy, even for unseen protocols. We use the example of electrophysiology
experiments, which are used to investigate the kinetics of the hERG potassium
ion channel. Here, `information-rich' protocols allow mathematical models to be
trained using numerous short experiments performed on the same cell. Typically,
assuming independent observational errors and training a model to an individual
experiment results in parameter estimates with very little dependence on
observational noise. Moreover, parameter sets arising from the same model
applied to different experiments often conflict - indicative of model
discrepancy. Our methods will help select more suitable mathematical models of
hERG for future studies, and will be widely applicable to a range of biological
modelling problems.

to exploit the human-AI complementarity to maximize decision rewards by
learning both an algorithmic policy that aims to complement humans by a routing
model that defers decisions to either a human or the AI to leverage the
resulting complementarity. We then extend our approach to leverage
opportunities and mitigate risks that arise in important contexts in practice:
1) when a team is composed of multiple humans with differential and potentially
complementary abilities, 2) when the observational data includes consistent
deterministic actions, and 3) when the covariate distribution of future

effectiveness of our proposed methods using data on real human responses and
semi-synthetic, and find that our methods offer reliable and advantageous
performance across setting, and that it is superior to when either the
algorithm or the AI make decisions on their own. We also find that the
extensions we propose effectively improve the robustness of the human-AI

and precision matrices in small datasets of real vectors, of the typical length
and dimension of human brain activity time series retrieved by functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Assuming a Gaussian model underlying the
neural activity, the problem consists in denoising the empirically observed
matrices in order to obtain a better estimator of the true precision and
covariance matrices. We consider several standard noise-cleaning algorithms and
compare them on two types of datasets. The first type are time series of fMRI
brain activity of human subjects at rest. The second type are synthetic time
series sampled from a generative Gaussian model of which we can vary the
fraction of dimensions per sample q = N/T and the strength of off-diagonal
correlations. The reliability of each algorithm is assessed in terms of
test-set likelihood and, in the case of synthetic data, of the distance from
the true precision matrix. We observe that the so called Optimal Rotationally
Invariant Estimator, based on Random Matrix Theory, leads to a significantly
lower distance from the true precision matrix in synthetic data, and higher
test likelihood in natural fMRI data. We propose a variant of the Optimal
Rotationally Invariant Estimator in which one of its parameters is optimised by
cross-validation. In the severe undersampling regime (large q) typical of fMRI
series, it outperforms all the other estimators. We furthermore propose a
simple algorithm based on an iterative likelihood gradient ascent, providing an
accurate estimation for weakly correlated datasets.

what portion of the Hilbert space is occupied by a quantum dataset becomes
increasingly hard with the number of qubits. In this context, the visualisation
of sets of multi-qubit pure quantum states on a single image can be helpful.
However, the current approaches to visualization of this type only allow the
representation of a set of single qubits (not allowing multi-qubit systems) or
a just a single multi-qubit system (not suitable if we care about sets of

for example. [1{3]. In this work we present a mapping that can uniquely
represent a set of arbitrary multi-qubit pure states on what we call a Binary

Schmidt decomposition and the Bloch sphere representation. We illustrate how
this can be used in the context of understanding the time evolution of quantum
states, e.g. providing immediate insights into the periodicity of the system
and even entanglement properties. We also provide a recursive algorithm which
translates from the computational basis state representation to the binary tree

(GW) tree. Conditional on the population surviving until a large time $T$,
sample $k$ individuals uniformly at random (without replacement) from amongst
those alive at time $T$. What is the genealogy of this sample of individuals?
In cases where the offspring distribution has finite variance, the
probabilistic properties of the joint ancestry of these $k$ particles are well
understood, as seen in \cite{HJR20, J19}. In the present article, we study the
joint ancestry of a sample of $k$ particles under the following regime: the
offspring distribution has mean $1$ (critical) and the tails of the offspring
distribution are \emph{heavy} in that $\alpha \in (1,2]$ is the supremum over
indices $\beta$ such that the $\beta^{\text{th}}$ moment is finite. We show
that for each $\alpha$, after rescaling time by $1/T$, there is a universal
stochastic process describing the joint coalescent structure of the $k$
distinct particles. The special case $\alpha = 2$ generalises the known case of
sampling from critical GW trees with finite variance where only pairwise
mergers are observed and the genealogical tree is, roughly speaking, some kind
of mixture of time-changed Kingman coalescents. The cases $\alpha \in (1,2)$
introduce new universal limiting partition-valued stochastic processes with
interesting probabilistic structures which have representations connected to
the Lauricella function and the Dirichlet distribution, and whose coalescent
structures exhibit multiple-mergers of family lines. Moreover, in the case
$\alpha \in (1,2)$, we show that the coalescent events of the ancestry of the
$k$ particles are associated with birth events that produce giant numbers of
offspring of the same order of magnitude as the entire population size, and we
compute the joint law of the ancestry together with the sizes of these giant
births.

F^{\dot \alpha \dot \beta}$ (with $I,J \in 1 \ldots 4$) if double excitations
are allowed for all three raising operators of the internal $SU(4)$ symmetry.
We present a tree-level analysis of related creation amplitudes in the nested
Bethe ansatz as well as in the original level-1 picture in which excitations of
various flavours scatter by a true $S$-matrix. In the latter case, the creation
amplitudes for all double excitations we encounter take a perfectly universal
form.
  Building on these ideas we work out Bethe solutions and states relevant in
the mixing problem concerning the on-shell Lagrangian of ${\cal N} = 4$ super
Yang-Mills theory. Owing to the very existence of double excitations, the
chiral Yang-Mills field strength tensor can be represented by the four fermions
$\{\psi^{31}, \psi^{32}, \psi^{41}, \psi^{42}\}$ moving on a spin chain of
length two. Our analysis remains restricted to leading order in the coupling,
where the conformal eigenstate corresponding to the on-shell Lagrangian only
comprises the pure Yang-Mills action. It should eventually be possible to
augment our analysis to higher loop orders by incorporating coupling
corrections in the relevant ingredients from the Bethe ansatz.
  Finally, it was recently realised how structure constants for operators
containing the hitherto hidden half of the excitations can be computed by the
hexagon formalism. We use this for a first test of our conjecture for the
on-shell Lagrangian, namely that its three-point function with two half-BPS
operators of equal length ought to vanish.

precision timing (whether Dark Count Noise in damaged SiPMs or elsewhere). This
technique exploits the correlation between time shifts on the leading edge of a
signal and the residual slope of the baseline (due to noise) which remains
after baseline subtraction. In the early days of timing circuits it was
realized that for many applications, despite amplitude fluctuations,
pulse-to-pulse variations in signal shape are usually negligible. Then an
additional measurement (ie of the signal charge) could be used to correct for
""Amplitude walk"". This walk correction is possible because of a redundancy
between leading edge slope and total signal charge. Modern ASICs could be
designed to measure the slope at threshold directly or with a pair of
discriminators. In this paper we point out that since low frequency noise
disrupts the correlation between these two equivalent measurements (dV/dt and

involves using gradients that are clipped to a prescribed size (e.g. with

portion of the gradient, U-Clip maintains a buffer of these values that is
added to the gradients on the next iteration (before clipping). We show that
the cumulative bias of the U-Clip updates is bounded by a constant. This

waste into different parts with the help of a smart object detection algorithm
using ConvoWaste in the field of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) and
image processing techniques. In this paper, deep learning and image processing
techniques are applied to precisely classify the waste, and the detected waste
is placed inside the corresponding bins with the help of a servo motor-based
system. This machine has the provision to notify the responsible authority
regarding the waste level of the bins and the time to trash out the bins filled
with garbage by using the ultrasonic sensors placed in each bin and the
dual-band GSM-based communication technology. The entire system is controlled
remotely through an Android app in order to dump the separated waste in the
desired place thanks to its automation properties. The use of this system can
aid in the process of recycling resources that were initially destined to
become waste, utilizing natural resources, and turning these resources back
into usable products. Thus, the system helps fulfill the criteria of a circular

CXR images from the CheXpert database, and the predictive capacity of
multi-modal latent representations learned by DirVAE models is investigated
through implementation of an auxiliary multi-label classification task, with a
view to enforce separation of latent factors according to class-specific

learned using the DirVAE were quantitatively and qualitatively assessed,
respectively, and compared with a standard Gaussian prior-VAE (GVAE). We
introduce a new approach for explainable multi-label classification in which we
conduct gradient-guided latent traversals for each class of interest. Study
findings indicate that the DirVAE is able to disentangle latent factors into
class-specific visual features, a property not afforded by the GVAE, and
achieve a marginal increase in predictive performance relative to GVAE. We
generate visual examples to show that our explainability method, when applied
to the trained DirVAE, is able to highlight regions in CXR images that are
clinically relevant to the class(es) of interest and additionally, can identify
cases where classification relies on spurious feature correlations.

be effective, good feature maps are crucial for mapping non-linearly separable

be linearly separable in feature space. Previous work has shown that quantum
feature map design can be automated for a given dataset using NSGA-II, a
genetic algorithm, while both minimizing circuit size and maximizing
classification accuracy. However, the evaluation of the accuracy achieved by a
candidate feature map is costly. In this work, we demonstrate the suitability
of kernel-target alignment as a substitute for accuracy in genetic
algorithm-based quantum feature map design. Kernel-target alignment is faster
to evaluate than accuracy and doesn't require some data points to be reserved
for its evaluation. To further accelerate the evaluation of genetic fitness, we
provide a method to approximate kernel-target alignment. To improve
kernel-target alignment and root mean squared error, the final trainable
parameters of the generated circuits are further trained using COBYLA to
determine whether a hybrid approach applying conventional circuit parameter
training can easily complement the genetic structure optimization approach. A
total of eight new approaches are compared to the original across nine varied
binary classification problems from the UCI machine learning repository,
showing that kernel-target alignment and its approximation produce feature map
circuits enabling comparable accuracy to the previous work but with larger

We evaluate this decision in terms of the expected simple regret, a difference
between the expected outcomes of the best and recommended treatment arms. Due
to the inherent uncertainty, we evaluate the regret using the minimax
criterion. For distributions with fixed variances (location-shift models), such
as Gaussian distributions, we derive asymptotic lower bounds for the worst-case
expected simple regret. Then, we show that the Random Sampling (RS)-Augmented
Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW) strategy proposed by Kato et al. (2022) is
asymptotically minimax optimal in the sense that the leading factor of its
worst-case expected simple regret asymptotically matches our derived worst-case
lower bound. Our result indicates that, for location-shift models, the optimal
RS-AIPW strategy draws treatment arms with varying probabilities based on their
variances. This result contrasts with the results of Bubeck et al. (2011),

research and industry. To solve multi-class classification problems, heuristic
strategies such as One-vs-One or One-vs-All can be employed. However, these
strategies require the number of binary classification models developed to grow
with the number of classes. Recent work in quantum machine learning has seen
the development of multi-class quantum classifiers that circumvent this growth
by learning a mapping between the data and a set of label states. This work
presents the first multi-class SWAP-Test classifier inspired by its binary
predecessor and the use of label states in recent work. With this classifier,
the cost of developing multiple models is avoided. In contrast to previous
work, the number of qubits required, the measurement strategy, and the topology
of the circuits used is invariant to the number of classes. In addition, unlike
other architectures for multi-class quantum classifiers, the state
reconstruction of a single qubit yields sufficient information for multi-class
classification tasks. Both analytical results and numerical simulations show
that this classifier is not only effective when applied to diverse
classification problems but also robust to certain conditions of noise.

  Incremental Learning","ICLR 2023 (Notable-top-25%)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) has been a challenging problem as
only a few training samples are accessible for each novel class in the new
sessions. Finetuning the backbone or adjusting the classifier prototypes
trained in the prior sessions would inevitably cause a misalignment between the
feature and classifier of old classes, which explains the well-known
catastrophic forgetting problem. In this paper, we deal with this misalignment
dilemma in FSCIL inspired by the recently discovered phenomenon named neural
collapse, which reveals that the last-layer features of the same class will
collapse into a vertex, and the vertices of all classes are aligned with the
classifier prototypes, which are formed as a simplex equiangular tight frame
(ETF). It corresponds to an optimal geometric structure for classification due
to the maximized Fisher Discriminant Ratio. We propose a neural collapse
inspired framework for FSCIL. A group of classifier prototypes are pre-assigned
as a simplex ETF for the whole label space, including the base session and all
the incremental sessions. During training, the classifier prototypes are not
learnable, and we adopt a novel loss function that drives the features into
their corresponding prototypes. Theoretical analysis shows that our method
holds the neural collapse optimality and does not break the feature-classifier
alignment in an incremental fashion. Experiments on the miniImageNet, CUB-200,

Poisson-Dirichlet (PD) statistics. In this paper, we focus on the case when the
underlying disorder is a logarithmically correlated Gaussian process $\phi_N$
on the box $[-N,N]^d\subset\mathbb{Z}^d$. Canonical examples include branching
random walk, $*$-scale invariant fields, with the central example being the two
dimensional Gaussian free field (GFF), a universal scaling limit of a wide
range of statistical mechanics models. The corresponding Gibbs measure obtained
by exponentiating $\beta$ (inverse temperature) times $\phi_N$ is a discrete
version of the Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) famously constructed by
Kahane. In the low temperature or supercritical regime, the GMC is expected to
exhibit atomic behavior on suitable renormalization, dictated by the extremal
statistics of $\phi_N$. Moreover, it is predicted, going back to a conjecture
made in 2001 by Carpentier and Le Doussal, that the weights of this atomic GMC
has a PD distribution. In a series of works, Biskup and Louidor carried out a
comprehensive study of the near maxima of the 2D GFF, and established the
conjectured PD behavior throughout the super-critical regime. In another
direction, Ding, Roy and Zeitouni established universal behavior of the maximum
for a general class of log-correlated Gaussian fields.
  In this paper we continue this program simply under the assumption of
log-correlation and nothing further. We prove that the GMC concentrates on an
$O(1)$ neighborhood of the local extrema and the PD prediction holds, in any
dimension $d$, throughout the supercritical regime, significantly generalizing
past results. Unlike for the 2D GFF, in absence of any Markovian structure for
general Gaussian fields, we develop and use as our key input a sharp estimate
of the size of level sets, which could have other applications.

questions are posed in a survey affects whether participants answer 'yes' or
'no', so the population that answers 'yes' to both questions cannot be modeled
as the intersection of two fixed sets. It can, however, be modeled as a
sequence of projections carried out in different orders. This and other

relies on comparing angles between subspaces rather than volumes between

  Now in the early 2020s, quantum computers have reached the point where some
of these quantum cognitive models can be implemented and investigated on
quantum hardware, by representing the mental states in qubit registers, and the
cognitive operations and decisions using different gates and measurements. This
paper develops such quantum circuit representations for quantum cognitive
models, focusing particularly on modeling order effects and decision-making

quantum circuits explicitly (just like the use of Boolean set theory does not
require the brain to be using classical bits), but that the mathematics shared
between quantum cognition and quantum computing motivates the exploration of
quantum computers for cognition modeling. Key quantum properties include

directly operates on the margins rather than their indirect approximations,
allowing for more targeted and effective robustness improvement. Experiments on

understanding quantum many-body systems, with applications in a variety of

limited to shallow circuits. Here we consider the setting where Alice and Bob,
in a distributed quantum computing architecture, want to prepare the same
Hamiltonian eigenstate. We demonstrate that the circuit depth of the eigenstate
preparation algorithm can be reduced when the devices can share limited
entanglement. Especially so in the case where one of them has a near-perfect
eigenstate, which is more efficiently broadcast to the other device. Our
approach requires only a single auxiliary qubit per device to be entangled with
the outside. We show that, in the near-convergent regime, the average relative
suppression of unwanted amplitudes is improved to $1/(2\sqrt{e}) \approx 0.30$
per run of the protocol, outperforming the average relative suppression of
$1/e\approx 0.37$ achieved with a single device alone for the same protocol.

denoising method for MRI denoising using diffusion denoising generative models.
Our three-stage framework integrates statistic-based denoising theory into
diffusion models and performs denoising through conditional generation. During
inference, we represent input noisy measurements as a sample from an

contact planning can enable versatile behaviors (e.g., sidewinding in limbless

include determining not only the sequence by which contact is made and broken
between the locomotor and the environments, but also the sequence of internal
shape changes (e.g., body bending and limb shoulder joint oscillation). Most
state-of-art contact planning algorithms focused on conventional robots

there is a lack of study on general contact planning in multi-legged robots. In
this paper, we show that using geometric mechanics framework, we can obtain the
global optimal contact sequence given the internal shape changes sequence.
Therefore, we simplify the contact planning problem to a graph optimization
problem to identify the internal shape changes. Taking advantages of the
spatio-temporal symmetry in locomotion, we map the graph optimization problem
to special cases of spin models, which allows us to obtain the global optima in

shift, their sensitivity to shifts in class conditional distributions is
precariously under explored. Meanwhile, popular deep domain adaptation
heuristics tend to falter when faced with label proportions shifts. While
several papers modify these heuristics in attempts to handle label proportions
shifts, inconsistencies in evaluation standards, datasets, and baselines make
it difficult to gauge the current best practices. In this paper, we introduce
RLSbench, a large-scale benchmark for relaxed label shift, consisting of $>$500
distribution shift pairs spanning vision, tabular, and language modalities,
with varying label proportions. Unlike existing benchmarks, which primarily
focus on shifts in class-conditional $p(x|y)$, our benchmark also focuses on
label marginal shifts. First, we assess 13 popular domain adaptation methods,
demonstrating more widespread failures under label proportion shifts than were
previously known. Next, we develop an effective two-step meta-algorithm that is
compatible with most domain adaptation heuristics: (i) pseudo-balance the data
at each epoch; and (ii) adjust the final classifier with target label
distribution estimate. The meta-algorithm improves existing domain adaptation
heuristics under large label proportion shifts, often by 2--10\% accuracy
points, while conferring minimal effect ($<$0.5\%) when label proportions do
not shift. We hope that these findings and the availability of RLSbench will
encourage researchers to rigorously evaluate proposed methods in relaxed label
shift settings. Code is publicly available at

general definition of a symmetry algebra is the commutant algebra, i.e., the
algebra of operators that commute with each local part. Thinking about symmetry
algebras as commutant algebras allows for the treatment of conventional
symmetries and unconventional symmetries (e.g., those responsible for weak
ergodicity breaking phenomena) on equal algebraic footing. In this work, we
discuss two methods for numerically constructing this commutant algebra
starting from a family of Hamiltonians. First, we use the equivalence of this
problem to that of simultaneous block-diagonalization of a given set of local
operators, and discuss a probabilistic method that has been found to work with
probability 1 for both Abelian and non-Abelian symmetries or commutant
algebras. Second, we map this problem onto the problem of determining
frustration-free ground states of certain Hamiltonians, and we use ideas from
tensor network algorithms to efficiently solve this problem in one dimension.
These numerical methods are useful in detecting standard and non-standard
conserved quantities in families of Hamiltonians, which includes examples of
regular symmetries, Hilbert space fragmentation, and quantum many-body scars,
and we show many such examples. In addition, they are necessary for verifying
several conjectures on the structure of the commutant algebras in these cases,

nova ever recorded (time to declined by two magnitudes is t_2=1.1 d) that
challenges our understanding of shock formation in novae. We investigate the
physical mechanisms behind nova emission from GeV gamma-rays to cm-band radio
using coordinated Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift and VLA observations supported by
optical photometry. Fermi-LAT detected short-lived (18 h) 0.1-100 GeV emission
from V1674 Her that appeared 6 h after the eruption began; this was at a level
of (1.6 +/- 0.4)x10^-6 photons cm^-2 s^-1. Eleven days later, simultaneous
NuSTAR and Swift X-ray observations revealed optically thin thermal plasma
shock-heated to kT_shock = 4 keV. The lack of a detectable 6.7 keV Fe K_alpha
emission suggests super-solar CNO abundances. The radio emission from V1674 Her
was consistent with thermal emission at early times and synchrotron at late
times. The radio spectrum steeply rising with frequency may be a result of
either free-free absorption of synchrotron and thermal emission by unshocked
outer regions of the nova shell or the Razin-Tsytovich effect attenuating
synchrotron emission in dense plasma. The development of the shock inside the
ejecta is unaffected by the extraordinarily rapid evolution and the
intermediate polar host of this nova.

molecular gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) in extragalactic studies. The
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, links the observed CO
emission to the total molecular gas mass. However, no single prescription
perfectly describes the variation of $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ across all environments
across galaxies as a function of metallicity, molecular gas opacity, line
excitation, and other factors. Using resolved spectral line observations of CO
and its isotopologues, we can constrain the molecular gas conditions and link
them to a variation in the conversion factor. We present new IRAM 30-m 1mm and
3mm line observations of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O} across the nearby
galaxy M101. Based on the CO isotopologue line ratios, we find that selective
nucleosynthesis and opacity changes are the main drivers of the variation in
the line emission across the galaxy. Furthermore, we estimated $\alpha_{\rm
CO(1-0)}$ using different approaches, including (i) the dust mass surface
density derived from far-IR emission as an independent tracer of the total gas
surface density and (ii) LTE-based measurements using the optically thin
$^{13}$CO(1-0) intensity. We find an average value of $\alpha_{\rm
CO}=4.4{\pm}0.9\rm\,M_\odot\,pc^{-2}(K\,km\,s^{-1})^{-1}$ across the galaxy,
with a decrease by a factor of 10 toward the 2 kpc central region. In contrast,
we find LTE-based values are lower by a factor of 2-3 across the disk relative
to the dust-based result. Accounting for $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ variations, we found
significantly reduced molecular gas depletion time by a factor 10 in the
galaxy's center. In conclusion, our result suggests implications for commonly
derived scaling relations, such as an underestimation of the slope of the
Kennicutt Schmidt law, if $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ variations are not accounted for.

the difficulty of determining the probability density function of complex,

limitation for precision measurements in many domains of science, including
astrophysics, for example, for the analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background,
gravitational waves, gravitational lensing, and exoplanets. This work presents
Score-based LIkelihood Characterization (SLIC), a framework that resolves this
issue by building a data-driven noise model using a set of noise realizations
from observations. We show that the approach produces unbiased and precise
likelihoods even in the presence of highly non-Gaussian correlated and
spatially varying noise. We use diffusion generative models to estimate the
gradient of the probability density of noise with respect to data elements. In
combination with the Jacobian of the physical model of the signal, we use
Langevin sampling to produce independent samples from the unbiased likelihood.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method using real data from the Hubble

order in black hole perturbation theory. In a ""weaker"" (non-agnostic) version
of this test, one assumes that the frequencies depend on the mass and spin of
the final Kerr black hole as predicted in perturbation theory. Linear
perturbation theory is expected to be a good approximation only at late times,
when the remnant is close enough to a stationary Kerr black hole. However, it
has been claimed that a superposition of overtones with frequencies fixed at
their asymptotic values in linear perturbation theory can reproduce the
waveform strain even at the peak. Is this overfitting, or are the overtones
physically present in the signal? To answer this question, we fit toy models of
increasing complexity, waveforms produced within linear perturbation theory,
and full numerical relativity waveforms using both agnostic and non-agnostic
ringdown models. We find that higher overtones are unphysical: their role is
mainly to ""fit away"" features such as initial data effects, power-law tails,
and (when present) nonlinearities. We then identify physical quasinormal modes
by fitting numerical waveforms in the original, agnostic spirit of the no-hair
test. We find that a physically meaningful ringdown model requires the
inclusion of higher multipoles, quasinormal mode frequencies induced by
spherical-spheroidal mode mixing, and nonlinear quasinormal modes. Even in this
""infinite signal-to-noise ratio"" version of the original spectroscopy test,
there is convincing evidence for the first overtone of the dominant multipole
only well after the peak of the radiation.

In analogy to the CKM matrix we introduce two $3\times3$ unitary matrices
$\hat\Delta_d(Z^\prime)$ and $\hat\Delta_u(Z^\prime)$ which are also hermitian.
They govern the flavour interactions mediated by $Z^\prime$ between down-quarks
and up-quarks, respectively, with
$\hat\Delta_d(Z^\prime)=\hat\Delta_u(Z^\prime)\equiv \hat\Delta_L(Z^\prime)$
for left-handed currents due to the unbroken $\text{SU(2)}_L$ gauge symmetry.
This assures the suppression of these contributions to all $Z^\prime$ mediated
FCNC processes at the one-loop level. As, in contrast to the GIM mechanism,
one-loop $Z^\prime$ contributions to flavour observables in $K$ and $B_{s,d}$
systems are governed by down-quark masses, they are ${\cal
O}(m^2_b/M^2_{Z^\prime})$ and negligible. With the ${\cal
O}(m^2_t/M^2_{Z^\prime})$ suppression they are likely negligible also in the
$D$ system. We present an explicit parametrization of $\hat\Delta_L(Z^\prime)$
in terms of two mixing angles and two complex phases that distinguishes it
profoundly from the CKM matrix. This framework can be generalized to purely
leptonic decays with matrices analogous to the PMNS matrix but profoundly
different from it. Interestingly, the breakdown of flavour universality between
the first two generations and the third one, both for quark and lepton
couplings to $Z^\prime$, is identified as a consequence of
$\hat\Delta_L(Z^\prime)$ being hermitian. The importance of the unitarity for
both $\hat\Delta_L(Z^\prime)$ and the CKM matrix in the light of the Cabibbo
anomaly is emphasized.

dark matter is produced through the early-time freeze-in when the scalar is
misaligned from the origin and free from the late-time exclusions when the
scalar does the damped oscillation and dynamically sets the kinetic mixing. We
also find that the scalar-photon coupling emerges from the underlying physics,
which changes the cosmological history and provides the experimental targets
based on the fine-structure constant variation and the equivalence principle
violation. To protect the scalar naturalness, we discretely re-establish the
broken shift symmetry by embedding the minimal model into the

cosmological models of galaxy evolution usually struggle to explain this
decrease. Here we use the semi-analytic model (SAM) L-Galaxies2020 to show that
this drop may be reproduced assuming standard prescriptions for dust production
and evolution. We extend the SAM with i) a state-of-the-art dust model which
adopts the two-size approximation and ii) a new disc instability criterion
which triggers bulge and central black hole growth. The model reproduces some
fundamental properties of the local galaxy population, such as the fraction of
spheroid-dominated galaxies and some scaling relations involving dust.
Moreover, the model predicts a galactic dust drop from $z \sim 1 \rightarrow
0$, which becomes closer to the observed one when adopting the new treatment of
disc instabilities. This result is related to the newly implemented
super-massive black hole growth during disc instabilities, which enhances the
quenching of massive galaxies. Consequently, these objects feature a lower gas
and dust content. We provide a census of the contribution of all the processes
affecting the galactic dust content. Accretion is the dominant dust mass growth
process. Destruction by supernovae, astration and ejection by winds have all a
non-negligible role in decreasing the overall dust content in galaxies below $z
\sim 1$. We also discuss predictions concerning extra-galactic dust, confirming
that a sputtering efficiency lower than the canonical one is required to match
the few available observations.

distributed across the 19 galaxies observed by the PHANGS-MUSE survey. The
nebulae have been classified using a new model-comparison-based algorithm that
exploits the odds ratio principle to assign a probabilistic classification to
each nebula in the sample. The resulting catalogue is the largest catalogue
containing complete spectral and spatial information for a variety of ionised
nebulae available so far in the literature. We developed this new algorithm to
address some of the limitations of the traditional classification criteria,
such as their binarity, the sharpness of the involved limits, and the limited
amount of data they rely on for the classification. The analysis of the
catalogue shows that the algorithm performs well when selecting H II regions.
We can recover their luminosity function, and its properties are in line with
what is available in the literature. We also identify a rather significant
population of shock-ionised regions (mostly composed of supernova remnants), an
order of magnitude larger than any other homogeneous catalogue of supernova
remnants currently available in the literature. The number of supernova
remnants we identify per galaxy is in line with results in our Galaxy and other
very nearby sources. However, limitations in the source detection algorithm
result in an incomplete sample of planetary nebulae, even though their
classification seems robust. Finally, we demonstrate how applying a correction
for the contribution of the diffuse ionised gas to the nebulae's spectra is
essential to obtain a robust classification of the objects and how a correct
measurement of the extinction using DIG-corrected line fluxes prompts the use
of a higher theoretical Ha/Hb ratio (3.03) than what is commonly used when
recovering the E(B-V) via the Balmer decrement technique in massive
star-forming galaxies.

detectable leakage from only one of the computational states of the qubit. We
study the performance of this model using gate-level simulations of the XZZX
surface code. Using the predicted erasure fraction and bias of metastable
$^{171}$Yb qubits, we find a threshold of 8.2%, which is 1.9 times higher than
the threshold for unbiased erasures, and 7.5 times higher than the threshold
for depolarizing errors. Surprisingly, the improved threshold is achieved
without bias-preserving controlled-not gates, and instead results from the
lower noise entropy in this model. We also introduce an XZZX cluster state
construction for measurement-based error correction, hybrid-fusion, that is
optimized for this noise model. By combining fusion operations and
deterministic entangling gates, this construction preserves the intrinsic
symmetry of the XZZX code, leading to a higher threshold of 10.3% and enabling
the use of rectangular codes with fewer qubits.

particle localizes in the vicinity of an attractive potential. This is
typically understood as the particle lowering its potential energy. In this
article, we discuss a paradigm where bound states arise purely due to kinetic
energy considerations. This phenomenon occurs in certain non-manifold spaces
that consist of multiple smooth surfaces that intersect one another. The
intersection region can be viewed as a singularity where dimensionality is not
defined. We demonstrate this idea in a setting where a particle moves on $M$
spaces ($M=2, 3, 4, \ldots$), each of dimensionality $D$ ($D=1, 2$ and $3$).
The spaces intersect at a common point, which serves as a singularity. To study
quantum behaviour in this setting, we discretize space and adopt a
tight-binding approach. We generically find a ground state that is localized
around the singular point, bound by the kinetic energy of `shuttling' among the
$M$ surfaces. We draw a quantitative analogy between singularities on the one
hand and local attractive potentials on the other. To each singularity, we
assign an equivalent potential that produces the same bound state wavefunction
and binding energy. The degree of a singularity ($M$, the number of
intersecting surfaces) determines the strength of the equivalent potential.
With $D=1$ and $D=2$, we show that any singularity creates a bound state. This
is analogous to the well known fact that any attractive potential creates a
bound state in 1D and 2D. In contrast, with $D=3$, bound states only appear
when the degree of the singularity exceeds a threshold value. This is analogous
to the fact that in three dimensions, a threshold potential strength is
required for bound state formation. We discuss implications for experiments and
theoretical studies in various domains of quantum physics.

Transiting multi-planet systems offer us the opportunity to examine the

resonant pairs show from exact commensurability provides us with information on
their migration and eccentricity-damping histories. Here, we adopt a
probabilistic approach, characterized by two distributions -- appropriate for
either the resonant or non-resonant planets -- to fit the observed planet
period ratio distribution. With the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we
find that ${\approx}15\%$ of exoplanets are in first order ($j+1{:}j$) MMRs,
the ratio of eccentricity-to-semi-major axis damping is too high to allow
overstable librations and that the results are by-and-large consistent with
Type-I migration theory. In addition, our modeling finds that a small fraction
of resonant pairs is captured into resonance during migration, implying late
planet formation (gas-poor). Most of the resonant pairs park themselves at the
migration barrier, indicating early planet formation (gas-rich). Furthermore,
after improving the criterion on two-body resonant trapping, we obtain an upper
limit of the disc surface density at the time the planets are locked in

the degree of fairness and the collective welfare achieved. Unfortunately, in
many resource-allocation settings, it is computationally hard to maximize
welfare while achieving fairness goals.
  In this work, we consider ex-ante notions of fairness; popular examples
include the \emph{randomized round-robin algorithm} and \emph{sortition
mechanism}. We propose a general framework to systematically study the
\emph{interpolation} between fairness and welfare goals in a multi-criteria

$Simple-Mix$) that achieve different trade-off guarantees with respect to
fairness and welfare. $\varepsilon-Mix$ achieves an optimal multi-criteria
approximation with respect to fairness and welfare, while $Simple-Mix$ achieves
optimality up to a constant factor with zero computational overhead beyond the
underlying \emph{welfare-maximizing mechanism} and the \emph{ex-ante fair

mechanisms, other than that the fair mechanism produces a distribution over the
set of all allocations. Indeed, if these mechanisms are themselves
approximation algorithms, our framework will retain the approximation factor,
guaranteeing sensitivity to the quality of the underlying mechanisms, while
being \emph{oblivious} to them. We also give an extensive experimental analysis

porous micromodels numerically using a dynamic pore network model. The porous
micromodel consists of distinct water-wet and oil-wet regions, whose fractions
are systematically varied to yield a variety of displacement patterns over a
wide range of capillary numbers. We find that the impact of mixed-wettability
is most prominent at low capillary number, and it depends on the complex
interplay between wettability fraction and the intrinsic contact angle of the
water-wet regions. For example, the fractal dimension of the displacement
pattern is a monotonically increasing function of wettability fraction in flow
cells with strongly water-wet clusters, but it becomes non-monotonic with
respect to wettability fraction in flow cells with weakly water-wet clusters.
Additionally, mixed-wettability also manifests itself in the injection-pressure
signature, which exhibits fluctuations especially at low wettability fraction.
Specifically, preferential filling of water-wet regions leads to reduced
effective permeability and higher injection pressure, even at vanishingly small
capillary numbers. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling analyses based on a
weighted average description of the overall wetting state of the mixed-wet

that cannot be simulated by means of local operations and classical

in the process. Using tools from quantum information theory, we quantify the
maximal fidelity of simulation that a local classical interaction could attain
while employing only LOCC. Under our assumptions, if an experiment detects a
fidelity larger than that threshold then a local classical description of the
interaction is no longer possible. As a prominent application of this scheme,
we study a general system of quantum harmonic oscillators initialised in
normally distributed coherent states and interacting via Newtonian gravity, and
discuss a possible physical implementation with torsion pendula. One of our
main technical contributions is the calculation of the above bound on the
maximal LOCC simulation fidelity for this family of systems. As opposed to

as a ribbon of concentrated ENA flux and one source (or possibly several) that

A fundamental problem for these Stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks (SCRNs)
is to understand the dependence of the stochastic behavior of these systems on
the chemical reaction rate parameters. Towards solving this problem, in this
paper we develop theoretical tools called comparison theorems that provide
stochastic ordering results for SCRNs. These theorems give sufficient
conditions for monotonic dependence on parameters in these network models,
which allow us to obtain, under suitable conditions, information about
transient and steady state behavior. These theorems exploit structural
properties of SCRNs, beyond those of general continuous-time Markov chains.
Furthermore, we derive two theorems to compare stationary distributions and
mean first passage times for SCRNs with different parameter values, or with the
same parameters and different initial conditions. These tools are developed for
SCRNs taking values in a generic (finite or countably infinite) state space and
can also be applied for non-mass-action kinetics models. When propensity
functions are bounded, our method of proof gives an explicit method for
coupling two comparable SCRNs, which can be used to simultaneously simulate
their sample paths in a comparable manner. We illustrate our results with
applications to models of enzymatic kinetics and epigenetic regulation by
chromatin modifications.

energy density functional of the Skyrme type. Relying on a flexible
three-dimensional coordinate representation of the nucleus, the model takes
into account both triaxial deformation and time-reversal symmetry breaking.
BSkG2 achieves a state-of-the-art global description of nuclear ground state
(g.s.) properties and reproduces in particular the known masses with a
root-mean-square (rms) deviation of 678 keV. Moving beyond g.s. properties, the
model also reproduces all empirical values for the primary and secondary
barriers as well as isomer excitation energies of actinide nuclei with rms
deviations below 500 keV, i.e. with unprecedented accuracy. Here we discuss in
detail the extension of our framework to the calculation of the fission
barriers of 45 actinide nuclei, including odd-mass and odd-odd systems. We
focus in particular on the impact of symmetry breaking which is key to the
accuracy of the model: we allow systematically for axial, reflection and
time-reversal symmetry breaking. The effect of the latter on the fission
properties of odd-mass and odd-odd nuclei is small, but we find that allowing
for shapes with triaxial or octupole deformation, as well as shapes with both,
is crucial to achieving this accuracy. The numerical accuracy of our coordinate
space approach, the variety of nuclear configurations explored and the
simultaneous successful description of fission properties and known masses
makes BSkG2 the tool of choice for the large-scale study of nuclear structure.

properties of SN Iax, especially their strong photospheric lines out to
extremely late times, allow us to model their optical spectra and derive
physical parameters for the long-lasting photosphere. We present an extensive
spectral timeseries, including 21 new spectra, of SN Iax 2014dt from +11 to
+562 days after maximum light. We are able to reproduce the entire timeseries
with a self-consistent, nearly unaltered deflagration explosion model from Fink
et al. (2014) using TARDIS, an open-source radiative transfer code (Kerzendorf
& Sim 2014; Kerzendorf et al. 2023). We find that the photospheric velocity of
SN 2014dt slows its evolution between +64 and +148 days, which closely overlaps
the phase when we see SN 2014dt diverge from the normal spectral evolution of
SN Ia (+90 to +150 days). The photospheric velocity at these epochs,
~400$-$1000 km s$^{-1}$, may demarcate a boundary within the ejecta below which
the physics of SN Iax and normal SN Ia differ. Our results suggest that SN
2014dt is consistent with a weak deflagration explosion model that leaves
behind a bound remnant and drives an optically thick, quasi-steady-state wind
creating the photospheric lines at late times. The data also suggest that this
wind may weaken at epochs past +450 days, perhaps indicating a radioactive
power source that has decayed away.

6G is a purposefully cooperative network that heavily depends on the

essential part of 6G, not only in terms of providing a virtual representation
of the physical elements and their dynamics and functionalities but rather DT

will play a main role in realizing the full potential of the 6G network by
utilizing the collected data at the cyber twin and then implementing using the
physical twin to ensure optimal levels of accuracy and efficiency. With that
said, such a cooperative non-conventional network infrastructure cannot rely on
conventional centralized intrusion detection and prevention systems. Zero-trust
is a new security framework that aims at protecting distributed data, devices,

zero-trust architecture in DT-enabled 6G networks. Unlike conventional
zero-trust solutions, the proposed framework adapts a decentralized mechanism
to ensure the security, privacy and authenticity of both the physical devices

components is often considered. A popular reduction method consists in
eliminating components that are not autoregulated, using variable substitution.
In this work, we show how this method can be extended, for asynchronous
dynamics of Boolean networks, to the elimination of vertices that have a
negative autoregulation, and study the effects on the dynamics and interaction
structure. For elimination of non-autoregulated variables, the preservation of
attractors is in general guaranteed only for fixed points. Here we give
sufficient conditions for the preservation of complex attractors. The removal
of so called mediator nodes (i.e. vertices with indegree and outdegree one) is
often considered, and frequently does not affect the attractor landscape. We
clarify that this is not always the case, and in some situations even subtle
changes in the interaction structure can lead to a different asymptotic
behaviour. Finally, we use properties of the more general elimination method
introduced here to give an alternative proof for a bound on the number of
attractors of asynchronous Boolean networks in terms of the cardinality of
positive feedback vertex sets of the interaction graph.

cross-device FL systems, only a subset of clients that satisfy local criteria

frequency requirements (to ensure privacy) are available for training at a

We provide (to our knowledge) the first theoretical framework to analyze the
convergence of FedAvg with cyclic client participation with several different
client optimizers such as GD, SGD, and shuffled SGD. Our analysis discovers
that cyclic client participation can achieve a faster asymptotic convergence
rate than vanilla FedAvg with uniform client participation under suitable

through the expanding photosphere method, which is independent of the cosmic
distance ladder. A recently introduced Gaussian process-based method allows for
a fast and precise modelling of spectral time series, which puts accurate and
computationally cheap Type II-based absolute distance determinations within
reach.
  Aims: The goal of the paper is to assess the internal consistency of this new
modelling technique coupled with the distance estimation empirically, using the
spectral time series of supernova siblings, i.e. supernovae that exploded in
the same host galaxy.
  Methods: We use a recently developed spectral emulator code, which is trained
on \textsc{Tardis} radiative transfer models and is capable of a fast maximum
likelihood parameter estimation and spectral fitting. After calculating the
relevant physical parameters of supernovae we apply the expanding photosphere
method to estimate their distances. Finally, we test the consistency of the
obtained values by applying the formalism of Bayes factors.
  Results: The distances to four different host galaxies were estimated based
on two supernovae in each. The distance estimates are not only consistent
within the errors for each of the supernova sibling pairs, but in the case of
two hosts they are precise to better than 5\%.
  Conclusions: Even though the literature data we used was not tailored for the
requirements of our analysis, the agreement of the final estimates shows that
the method is robust and is capable of inferring both precise and consistent
distances. By using high-quality spectral time series, this method can provide
precise distance estimates independent of the distance ladder, which are of
high value for cosmology.

drop substantially. Artifacts that only occur within scans from specific
scanners are major causes of this poor generalizability. We aimed to improve
the reliability of deep learning classification models by proposing
Uncertainty-Based Instance eXclusion (UBIX). This technique, based on
multiple-instance learning, reduces the effect of corrupted instances on the
bag-classification by seamlessly integrating out-of-distribution (OOD) instance
detection during inference. Although UBIX is generally applicable to different
medical images and diverse classification tasks, we focused on staging of
age-related macular degeneration in optical coherence tomography. After being
trained using images from one vendor, UBIX showed a reliable behavior, with a
slight decrease in performance (a decrease of the quadratic weighted kappa
($\kappa_w$) from 0.861 to 0.708), when applied to images from different
vendors containing artifacts; while a state-of-the-art 3D neural network
suffered from a significant detriment of performance ($\kappa_w$ from 0.852 to
0.084) on the same test set. We showed that instances with unseen artifacts can
be identified with OOD detection and their contribution to the bag-level
predictions can be reduced, improving reliability without the need for
retraining on new data. This potentially increases the applicability of
artificial intelligence models to data from other scanners than the ones for

issue. Nowadays, tons of techniques, such as machine learning and deep learning
traffic classifiers, have been applied to analyze users app traffic. These
techniques allow the monitor to get the fingerprints of using apps while the
user traffic is still encrypted, which raises a severe privacy issue. In order
to fight against this type of data analysis, people have been researching
obfuscation algorithms to confuse feature-based machine learning classifiers
with data camouflage by modification on packet length distribution. The
existing works achieve this goal by remapping traffic packet length
distribution from the source app to the fake camouflage app. However, this
solution suffers from its lack of scalability and flexibility in practical
application since the method needs to pre-sample the target fake apps traffic
before the use of traffic camouflage. In this paper, we proposed a practical
solution by using a mathematical model to calculate the target distribution
while maintaining at least 50 percent accuracy drops on the performance of the
AppScanner mobile traffic classifier and roughly 20 percent overhead created
during packet modification.

the lowest possible dimension in which the simple exceptional Lie group ${\bf
E}_8$ can be realized. This raised the question about the lowest dimensions in
which various real forms of the exceptional groups ${\bf E}_\ell$ can be
realized. Cartan claims that ${\bf E}_6$ can be realized in dimension 16.
However Cartan refers to the complex group ${\bf E}_6$, or its split real form
$E_I$. His claim is also valid in the case of the real form denoted by
$E_{IV}$. We find however that the real forms $E_{II}$ and $E_{III}$ of ${\bf
E}_6$ can not be realized in dimension 16 \`a la Cartan. In this paper we
realize them in dimension 24 as groups of CR automorphisms of certain CR
structures of higher codimension.
  As a byproduct of these two realizations, we provide a full list of CR
structures $(M,H,J)$ and their CR embeddings in an appropriate ${\bf C}^N$,
which satisfy the following conditions:
  (1) they have real codimension $k>1$,
  (2) the real vector distribution $H$ proper for the action of the complex
structure $J$ is such that $[H,H]+H=TM$,
  (3) the local group $G_J$ of CR automorphisms of the structure $(M,H,J)$ is
simple, acts transitively on $M$ and has isotropy $P$ being a parabolic
subgroup in $G_J$,
  (4) the local symmetry group $G$ of the vector distribution $H$ on $M$
coincides with the group $G_J$ of CR automorphisms of $(M,H,J)$. Because all
the CR structures from our list satisfy the last property we call them
accidental. Our CR structures of higher codimension with the exceptional
symmetries $E_{II}$ and $E_{III}$ are particular entries in this list.

tumor microenvironment (iTME) is crucial for the development of immunotherapy
treatments as well as for predicting their outcomes. Highly multiplexed tissue
imaging (HMTI) technologies offer a tool which can capture cell properties of
tissue samples by measuring expression of various proteins and storing them in
separate image channels. HMTI technologies can be used to gain insights into
the iTME and in particular how the iTME differs for different patient outcome
groups of interest (e.g., treatment responders vs. non-responders).
Understanding the systematic differences in the iTME of different patient
outcome groups is crucial for developing better treatments and personalising
existing treatments. However, such analyses are inherently limited by the fact
that any two tissue samples vary due to a large number of factors unrelated to
the outcome. Here, we present CF-HistoGAN, a machine learning framework that
employs generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create artificial
counterfactual tissue samples that resemble the original tissue samples as
closely as possible but capture the characteristics of a different patient
outcome group. Specifically, we learn to ""translate"" HMTI samples from one
patient group to create artificial paired samples. We show that this approach
allows to directly study the effects of different patient outcomes on the iTMEs
of individual tissue samples. We demonstrate that CF-HistoGAN can be employed
as an explorative tool for understanding iTME effects on the pixel level.
Moreover, we show that our method can be used to identify statistically
significant differences in the expression of different proteins between patient
groups with greater sensitivity compared to conventional approaches.

decomposes data into two semantically independent properties: the desired
property, which captures a specific aspect of the data (e.g. the voice in an
audio signal), and the context property, which aggregates all other information
(e.g. the content of the audio signal), without any labels given. Autodecompose
uses two complementary augmentations, one that manipulates the context while
preserving the desired property and the other that manipulates the desired
property while preserving the context. The augmented variants of the data are
encoded by two encoders and reconstructed by a decoder. We prove that one of
the encoders embeds the desired property while the other embeds the context
property. We apply Autodecompose to audio signals to encode sound source (human
voice) and content. We pre-trained the model on YouTube and LibriSpeech
datasets and fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner without exposing the
labels. Our results showed that, using the sound source encoder of pre-trained
Autodecompose, a linear classifier achieves F1 score of 97.6\% in recognizing
the voice of 30 speakers using only 10 seconds of labeled samples, compared to
95.7\% for supervised models. Additionally, our experiments showed that
Autodecompose is robust against overfitting even when a large model is
pre-trained on a small dataset. A large Autodecompose model was pre-trained
from scratch on 60 seconds of audio from 3 speakers achieved over 98.5\% F1
score in recognizing those three speakers in other unseen utterances. We
finally show that the context encoder embeds information about the content of
the speech and ignores the sound source information.

considering both temporal and frequency features, aligning them across domains,

operations assisted by classical communication (LOCC) plays a crucial role in
entanglement theory and its applications in quantum information processing.
While transformations of this type among pure bipartite states were
characterized long ago and have a revealing theoretical structure, it turns out
that generic fully entangled pure multipartite states cannot be obtained from
nor transformed to any inequivalent fully entangled state under LOCC. States
with this property are referred to as isolated. Nevertheless, the above result
does not forbid the existence of particular SLOCC classes that are free of
isolation and therefore display a rich structure regarding LOCC convertibility.
In fact, it is known that the celebrated $n$-qubit GHZ and W states give
particular examples of such classes and in this work, we investigate this
question in general. One of our main results is to show that the SLOCC class of
the 3-qutrit totally antisymmetric state is isolation-free as well. Actually,
all states in this class can be converted to inequivalent states by LOCC
protocols with just one round of classical communication (as in the GHZ and W
cases). Thus, we consider next whether there are other classes with this
property and we find a large set of negative answers. Indeed, we prove weak
isolation (i.e., states that cannot be obtained with finite-round LOCC nor
transformed by one-round LOCC) for very general classes, including all SLOCC
families with compact stabilizers and many with non-compact stabilizers, such
as the classes corresponding to the $n$-qunit totally antisymmetric states for
$n\geq4$. Finally, given the pleasant feature found in the family corresponding

  Learning in a Connected Driving Environment",,,,,"cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based framework for traffic
shaping. The proposed framework offers a key advantage over existing congestion
management strategies which is the ability to mitigate hysteresis phenomena.
Unlike existing congestion management strategies that focus on breakdown
prevention, the proposed framework is extremely effective after breakdown
formation. The proposed framework assumes partial connectivity between the
automated vehicles which share information. The framework requires a basic
level of autonomy defined by one-dimensional longitudinal control. This
framework is primarily built using a centralized training, centralized
execution multi-agent deep reinforcement learning approach, where longitudinal
control is defined by signals of acceleration or deceleration commands which
are then executed by all agents uniformly. The model undertaken for training
and testing of the framework is based on the well-known Double Deep Q-Learning
algorithm which takes the average state of flow within the traffic stream as
the model input and outputs actions in the form of acceleration or deceleration
values. We demonstrate the ability of the model to shape the state of traffic,
mitigate the negative effects of hysteresis, and even improve traffic flow
beyond its original level. This paper also identifies the minimum percentage of
CAVs required to successfully shape the traffic under an assumption of
uniformly distributed CAVs within the loop system. The framework illustrated in
this work doesnt just show the theoretical applicability of reinforcement
learning to tackle such challenges but also proposes a realistic solution that
only requires partial connectivity and continuous monitoring of the average
speed of the system, which can be achieved using readily available sensors that
measure the speeds of vehicles in reasonable proximity to the CAVs.

part and a question part, a recent work finds these neural solvers may only
perform shallow pattern matching between the context text and the golden

processes fail to enforce the mathematical laws into the design, where the
representations for mathematical equivalent expressions are different. To
address these two issues, we propose a new encoder-decoder architecture that
fully leverages the question text and preserves step-wise commutative law.
Besides generating quantity embeddings, our encoder further encodes the
question text and uses it to guide the decoding process. At each step, our
decoder uses Deep Sets to compute expression representations so that these

four established benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms

While doing so, it is ensured that the computational and memory complexity is

that even using gradients from as low as \textit{two} parameters, our method

Large separation binaries (>50 milliseconds of arc, mas) can be probed by

close binaries can be resolved by photometry and spectroscopy. However, optical
long baseline interferometry is mandatory to establish the multiplicity of
Galactic massive stars at the separation gap between 1 and 50 mas. In this

massive stars (H<7.5 mag). We initiated a pilot survey of bright O-type stars

systems in average atmospheric conditions around a magnitude of H=7.5 mag. We
systematically reduced the obtained data with the public reduction pipeline of
the instrument. We analyzed the reduced data using the dedicated python
software CANDID to detect companions. Out of these 29 systems, we resolved 19
companions in 17 different systems with angular separations between ~0.5 and 50

average number of companions fc=19/29=0.66+/-0.13. Those results are in
agreement with the results of the SMASH+ survey in the Southern Hemisphere.
Thirteen of these companions have been resolved for the first time, including
the companion responsible for the nonthermal emission in Cyg OB2-5 A and the

formalize this data selection problem as selecting a subset of a large raw

target samples. Due to the large scale and dimensionality of the raw text data,
existing methods use simple heuristics to select data that are similar to a
high-quality reference corpus (e.g., Wikipedia), or leverage experts to
manually curate data. Instead, we extend the classic importance resampling
approach used in low-dimensions for LM data selection. Crucially, we work in a
reduced feature space to make importance weight estimation tractable over the
space of text. To determine an appropriate feature space, we first show that KL
reduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between selected data and
the target in a feature space, has high correlation with average accuracy on 8
downstream tasks (r=0.89) when computed with simple n-gram features. From this
observation, we present Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an
efficient and scalable algorithm that estimates importance weights in a reduced
feature space (e.g., n-gram features in our instantiation) and selects data
with importance resampling according to these weights. When training
general-domain models (target is Wikipedia + books), DSIR improves over random
selection and heuristic filtering baselines by 2--2.5% on the GLUE benchmark.
When performing continued pretraining towards a specific domain, DSIR performs
comparably to expert curated data across 8 target distributions.

to manipulate the interlayer coupling, we applied pressure on two quasi-2D
sister compounds, namely, Cr2Si2Te6 (CST) and Mn3Si2Te6 (MST), up to ~1 GPa.
Magnetic property measurements with the application of pressure revealed that
the ferromagnetic transition temperature decreases in CST while the opposite
trend occurs for the ferrimagnet MST. In MST, the magnetization decreases with
the increase in the pressure, and such trend is not clearly noticed in CST,
within the pressure range studied. Theoretical calculations showed the overall
pressure effect on layer separation, bond angle, and exchange coupling,
strongly influencing the change in subsequent magnetic characteristics.
Exchange coupling in Mn3Si2Te6 is strongly frustrated and the first nearest
neighbor interaction is the most dominant of the components with the strongest
pressure dependence. Whereas, in Cr2Si2Te6, the exchange coupling parameters
exhibit very little dependence on the pressure. This combined experimental and
theoretical work has the potential to expand to other relevant quantum

cross-correlations, and quantify their simultaneous imprints on the
corresponding web constituents - i.e., halos, filaments, walls, and voids - for
a series of rarity levels. Our first analysis is centered on a
density-threshold-based approach in configuration space. In particular, we show
that the presence of massive neutrinos does affect the baryon acoustic
oscillation peak amplitudes of all of the critical point correlation functions
above/below the rarity threshold, as well as the positions of their
correspondent inflection points at large scales: departures from analogous
measurements carried out in the baseline massless neutrino scenario can reach
up to ~7% in autocorrelations and ~9% in cross-correlations at z=0 when
M_nu=0.1 eV, and are more pronounced for higher neutrino mass values. In turn,
these combined multiscale effects can be used as a novel technique to set upper

indicate that by the end of the protostellar phase, outflows will remove

hence to the simplified core-to-star conversion prescriptions. Furthermore, we
show that cavity opening angles, and momentum and energy distributions all

even garden-variety protostellar outflows: (a) effectively inject energy and
momentum into their environments on $10$ kAU scales, and (b) significantly
disrupt their natal cores, ejecting a large fraction of the mass that would

pulse-coupled models such as the Peskin model on pacemaker cells. It is
well-known that the Winfree ensemble with the first-order coupling exhibits
discrete asymptotic patterns such as incoherence, locking and death depending
on the coupling strength and variance of natural frequencies. In this paper, we
further study higher-order couplings which makes the dynamics more close to the
behaviors of the Peskin model. For this, we propose several sufficient
frameworks for asymptotic patterns compared to the first-order coupling model.
Our proposed conditions on the coupling strength, natural frequencies and
initial data are independent of the number of oscillators so that they can be
applied to the corresponding mean-field model. We also provide several
numerical simulations and compare them with analytical results.

warfare agents (CWAs) is of great importance for the safety and security of the

F, S) as efficient sensors towards selected CWAs, such as arsine (AsH3),
mustard gas (C4H8Cl2S), cyanogen chloride (NCCl), and phosgene (COCl2) both in
aqueous and non-aqueous mediums. Our van der Waals corrected density functional
theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the CWAs bind with Mo2CF2, and Mo2CS2
monolayers under strong chemisorption with binding energies in the range of
-2.33 to -4.05 eV, whereas Mo2CO2 results in comparatively weak bindings of
-0.29 to -0.58 eV. We further report the variations in the electronic
properties, electrostatic potentials and work functions of Mo2CTx upon the
adsorption of CWAs, which authenticate an efficient sensing mechanism.
Statistical thermodynamic analysis is applied to explore the sensing properties
of Mo2CTx at various of temperatures and pressures. We believe that our

condensation is expected -- curvature does not diverge, rather it converges to
zero. However, as the discontinuous behavior that identify condensation is only
observed at the thermodynamic limit, a study of IG curvature at finite number

observed by taking the thermodynamic limit ($N\to \infty$) posteriorly. This

as $N$ increases, the values of curvature decrease proportionally to a power of
$N$ while the temperature at which the maximum value of curvature occurs
approaches the usually defined critical temperature. This means that, in the
thermodynamic limit, curvature has a limited value where a phase transition is
observed, contradicting the forementioned conjecture.

Specifically, the SIM is endowed with a multilayer structure and is deployed at

the need for digital beamforming and operates with low-resolution
digital-to-analog converters and a moderate number of radio-frequency chains,
which significantly reduces the hardware cost and energy consumption, while
substantially decreasing the precoding delay benefiting from the processing
performed in the wave domain. To leverage the benefits of SIM-enabled
transceivers, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the sum rate
of all the users by jointly designing the transmit power allocated to them and
the analog beamforming in the wave domain. Numerical results based on a
customized alternating optimization algorithm corroborate the effectiveness of
the proposed SIM-enabled analog beamforming design as compared with various
benchmark schemes. Most notably, the proposed analog beamforming scheme is
capable of substantially decreasing the precoding delay compared to its digital
counterpart.

These emergent abstractions function as representations of one`s self and of

is a mechanistic explanation of aspects of consciousness.

not yet realized such relations, instead finding that the late evolutionary
phases are significantly affected by a complicated interplay between nuclear
reactions, chemical mixing, and neutrino radiation, leading to non-monotonic
initial mass dependencies of the iron core mass and the compactness parameter.
We conduct a set of stellar evolution simulations, in which evolutions of He
star models are followed until their central densities uniformly reach
10$^{10}$ g cm$^{-3}$, and analyze their final structures as well as their
evolutionary properties including the lifetime, surface radius change, and

of training a separate expert LM per training task instead of a single MT LM

to make use of knowledge beyond text and to make use of cross-sentence
relations in text. Intuitive ways for the two issues are Knowledge Graph (KG)
and Graph Neural Network (GNN) respectively. Entities are semantic units in
text and in KG. This paper focuses on both issues by leveraging entities
mentioned in text to connect GNN and KG for summarization. Firstly, entities
are leveraged to construct a sentence-entity graph with weighted multi-type
edges to model sentence relations, and a relational heterogeneous GNN for
summarization is proposed to calculate node encodings. Secondly, entities are
leveraged to link the graph to KG to collect knowledge. Thirdly, entities guide
a two-step summarization framework defining a multi-task selector to select
salient sentences and entities, and using an entity-focused abstractor to
compress the sentences. GNN is connected with KG by constructing
sentence-entity graphs where entity-entity edges are built based on KG,
initializing entity embeddings on KG, and training entity embeddings using
entity-entity edges. The relational heterogeneous GNN utilizes both edge
weights and edge types in GNN to calculate graphs with weighted multi-type
edges. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms extractive baselines
including the HGNN-based HGNNSum and abstractive baselines including the
entity-driven SENECA on CNN/DM, and outperforms most baselines on NYT50.
Experiments on sub-datasets show the density of sentence-entity edges greatly
influences the performance of the proposed method. The greater the density, the
better the performance. Ablations show effectiveness of the method.

behaviors change. In this work, we use time-dependent probability generating
functions (PGFs) to capture these characteristics by modeling a stochastic
branching process of the spread of a disease over a network of contacts in
which public health interventions are introduced over time. To achieve this, we
define a general transmissibility equation to account for varying transmission
rates (e.g. masking), recovery rates (e.g. treatment), contact patterns (e.g.
social distancing) and percentage of the population immunized (e.g.
vaccination). The resulting framework allows for a temporal and probabilistic
analysis of an intervention's impact on disease spread, which match
continuous-time stochastic simulations that are much more computationally
expensive. To aid policy making, we then define several metrics over which
temporal and probabilistic intervention forecasts can be compared: Looking at
the expected number of cases and the worst-case scenario over time, as well as
the probability of reaching a critical level of cases and of not seeing any

advances in genomic analysis have uncovered numerous candidate genes with
common and/or rare mutations that increase susceptibility to ASD. In addition,
there is increasing evidence that copy number variations (CNVs), single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and unusual de novo variants negatively affect
neurodevelopment pathways in various ways. The overall rate of copy number
variants found in patients with autism is 10%-20%, of which 3%-7% can be
detected cytogenetically. Although the role of submicroscopic CNVs in ASD has
been studied recently, their association with genomic loci and genes has not
been properly studied. In this review, we focus on 47 ASD-associated CNV
regions and their related genes. Here, we identify 1,632 protein-coding genes
and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) within these regions. Among them, 552 are
significantly expressed in the brain. Using a list of ASD-associated genes from
SFARI, we detect 17 regions containing at least one known ASD-associated
protein-coding genes. Of the remaining 30 regions, we identify 24 regions
containing at least one protein-coding genes with brain-enriched expression and
nervous system phenotype in mouse mutant and one lncRNAs with both
brain-enriched expression and upregulation in iPSC to neuron differentiation.
Our analyses highlight the diversity of genetic lesions of CNV regions that
contribute to ASD and provide new genetic evidence that lncRNA genes may
contribute to etiology of ASD. In addition, the discovered CNVs will be a
valuable resource for diagnostic facilities, therapeutic strategies, and
research in terms of variation priority.

construct a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which captures the higher-order

centroids, of each layer from the training data, precompute them with model
weights, and save the results in tables. For future input, the results of the
closest centroids with the input features can be directly read from the table,
as the approximation of layer output.
  We propose the novel centroid learning technique for DNN, which enables
centroid learning through backpropagation, and adapts three levels of
approximation to minimize the model loss. By this technique, LUT-NN achieves
comparable accuracy (<5% difference) with original models on real complex

operators to only two: closest centroid search and table lookup. We implement
them for Intel and ARM CPUs. The model size is reduced by up to 3.5x for CNN

quick reinterpretation method for models predicting LLPs produced from meson
decays. With the method, we are not required to run Monte-Carlo simulation,
implement detector geometries and efficiencies, or apply experimental cuts in
an event analysis, as typically done in recasting and reinterpretation works.
The main ingredients our method requires are only the theoretical input,
allowing for computation of the production and decay rates of the LLPs. There
are two conditions for the method to work: firstly, the LLPs in the models
considered should be produced from a set of mesons with similar mass and
lifetime (or the same meson) and second, the LLPs should, in general, have a
lab-frame decay length much larger than the distance between the interaction
point and the detector. As an example, we use this method to reinterpret
exclusion bounds on heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) in the minimal ``3+1''

sets by applying the transformations on $g_{tt}$ and $g_{rr}$ metric
potentials. The original anisotropic source is adorned by the first sector, and
we make it solvable by considering two different well-behaved solutions. The
second sector is in terms of an additional source and we adopt some constraints
to find deformation functions. The first constraint is the isotropization
condition which transforms the total fluid distribution into an isotropic
system only for a specific value of the decoupling parameter. The other
constraint is taken as the complexity-free fluid distribution. The unknown

inside the turbine swept area, are examined in concert with simultaneously
measured performance. Correlations between flow-field and performance
variability are established by an unsupervised hierarchical flow-field
clustering pipeline. This features a principal component analysis (PCA)
pre-processor that allows for clustering based on all the dynamics present in
the high-dimensional flow-field data in an interpretable, low-dimensional
subspace that is weighted by contribution to overall velocity variance. We find
that the flow-field clusters and their associated performance are correlated
primarily with inflow fluctuations, despite relatively low turbulence
intensity, that drive variations in the timing of the dynamic stall process.
Further, we find no evidence of substantial cycle-to-cycle hysteresis.
Clustering reveals persistent correlations between performance and flow-field
variability during the upstream portion of the turbine rotation. The approach
employed here provides a more comprehensive picture of cross-flow turbine flow
fields and performance than aggregate, statistical representations.

extensions that offer useful insights into the theory of optimal stopping. The
original solution is to set one stopping threshold that gives rise to an
immediately rejected sample $r$ out of the candidate pool of size $n$ and to
accept the first candidate that is subsequently interviewed and bests the prior
$r$ rejected. In reality, it is not uncommon to draw a line between job
candidates to distinguish those above the line vs those below the line. Here we
consider such satisficing sectary problem that views suboptimal choices
(finding any of the top $d$ candidates) also as hiring success. We use a
multiple stopping criteria $(r_1, r_2, \cdots, r_d)$ that sequentially lowers
the expectation when the prior selection criteria yields no choice. We
calculate the probability of securing the top $d$ candidate in closed form
solutions which are in excellent agreement with computer simulations. The
exhaustive search for optimal stopping has to deal with large parameter space
and thus can quickly incur astronomically large computational times. In light
of this, we apply the effective computational method of simulated annealing to
find optimal $r_i$ values which performs reasonably well as compared with the
exhaustive search despite having significantly less computing time. Our work
sheds light on maximizing the likelihood of securing satisficing (suboptimal)
outcomes using adaptive search strategy in combination with computation

Moreover, to learn the user-specific sequence representations, existing works

introduce a lightweight external attention-enhanced GCN-based framework to
solve the above challenges, namely LEA-GCN. Specifically, by only keeping the

capture the collaborative filtering signals of the items from both domains. To
further alleviate the framework structure and aggregate the user-specific
sequential pattern, we devise a novel dual-channel External Attention (EA)

linear structure. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world

implement different undersampling methods to eliminate the imbalance problem,

  earlier paper arXiv:2203.00233",,,,"cs.DS cs.GT cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommendation systems capable of providing diverse sets of results are a
focus of increasing importance, with motivations ranging from fairness to
novelty and other aspects of optimizing user experience. One form of diversity
of recent interest is calibration, the notion that personalized recommendations
should reflect the full distribution of a user's interests, rather than a
single predominant category -- for instance, a user who mainly reads
entertainment news but also wants to keep up with news on the environment and
the economy would prefer to see a mixture of these genres, not solely
entertainment news. Existing work has formulated calibration as a subset
selection problem; this line of work observes that the formulation requires the
unrealistic assumption that all recommended items receive equal consideration
from the user, but leaves as an open question the more realistic setting in
which user attention decays as they move down the list of results.
  In this paper, we consider calibration with decaying user attention under two
different models. In both models, there is a set of underlying genres that
items can belong to. In the first setting, where items are represented by
fine-grained mixtures of genre percentages, we provide a
$(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm by extending techniques for constrained
submodular optimization. In the second setting, where items are coarsely binned
into a single genre each, we surpass the $(1-1/e)$ barrier imposed by
submodular maximization and give a $2/3$-approximate greedy algorithm. Our work
thus addresses the problem of capturing ordering effects due to decaying
attention, allowing for the extension of near-optimal calibration from
recommendation sets to recommendation lists.

now there is still a lack of canonical model of quantum recurrent neural

built by stacking the QRBs in a staggered way that can greatly reduce the

That is, our QRNN is much more accessible on NISQ devices. Furthermore, the
performance of the present QRNN model is verified concretely using three
different kinds of classical sequential data, i.e., meteorological indicators,

QRNN achieves much better performance in prediction (classification) accuracy
against the classical RNN and state-of-the-art QNN models for sequential

addresses several limitations of existing causal discovery methods for
autocorrelated and non-stationary time series data, such as high
dimensionality, the inability to identify lagged causal relationships, and the
overlook of changing modules. Our approach identifies both lagged and
instantaneous/contemporaneous causal relationships along with changing modules
that vary over time. The method optimizes the conditioning sets in a
constraint-based search by considering lagged parents instead of conditioning
on the entire past that addresses high dimensionality. The changing modules are
detected by considering both contemporaneous and lagged parents. The approach
first detects the lagged adjacencies, then identifies the changing modules and
contemporaneous adjacencies, and finally determines the causal direction. We
extensively evaluated the proposed method using synthetic datasets and a
real-world clinical dataset and compared its performance with several baseline
approaches. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in

  System","Accepted by WWW'23",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Recommender systems usually rely on observed user interaction data to build
personalized recommendation models, assuming that the observed data reflect
user interest. However, user interacting with an item may also due to
conformity, the need to follow popular items. Most previous studies neglect
user's conformity and entangle interest with it, which may cause the
recommender systems fail to provide satisfying results. Therefore, from the
cause-effect view, disentangling these interaction causes is a crucial issue.
It also contributes to OOD problems, where training and test data are
out-of-distribution. Nevertheless, it is quite challenging as we lack the
signal to differentiate interest and conformity. The data sparsity of pure
cause and the items' long-tail problem hinder disentangled causal embedding. In
this paper, we propose DCCL, a framework that adopts contrastive learning to
disentangle these two causes by sample augmentation for interest and conformity
respectively. Futhermore, DCCL is model-agnostic, which can be easily deployed
in any industrial online system. Extensive experiments are conducted over two
real-world datasets and DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on top of

are sufficient to qualitatively observe some typical quantum phenomena in the
continuous-time evolution limit, such as resonant tunneling and localization
phenomena. We study the propagation of a spin excitation in Trotter circuits
with a large step size. The circuits are formed of two types of two-qubit
gates, i.e. XY gates and controlled- Rx gates, and single-qubit Rz gates. The
configuration of the Rz gates determines the distribution of the spin
excitation at the end of evolution. We demonstrate the resonant tunneling with
up to four steps and the localization phenomenon with dozens of steps in
Trotter circuits. Our results show that the circuit depth required for
qualitative observation of some significant quantum phenomena is much smaller
than that required for quantitative computation, suggesting that it is feasible
to apply qualitative observations to near-term quantum computers. We also
provide a way to use the physics laws to understand the error propagation in

adversaries embed a hidden backdoor trigger during the training process for
malicious prediction manipulation. These attacks pose great threats to the
applications of DNNs under the real-world machine learning as a service (MLaaS)
setting, where the deployed model is fully black-box while the users can only
query and obtain its predictions. Currently, there are many existing defenses
to reduce backdoor threats. However, almost all of them cannot be adopted in
MLaaS scenarios since they require getting access to or even modifying the

input-level backdoor detection, called SCALE-UP, which requires only the
predicted labels to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we identify and
filter malicious testing samples by analyzing their prediction consistency
during the pixel-wise amplification process. Our defense is motivated by an
intriguing observation (dubbed scaled prediction consistency) that the
predictions of poisoned samples are significantly more consistent compared to
those of benign ones when amplifying all pixel values. Besides, we also provide
theoretical foundations to explain this phenomenon. Extensive experiments are

presence of memory is akin to an agent performing a proportional-integral

more impact the memory has on its motion, better is the movement of an isolated

the interactions between the agents lead to non-monotonic effect of memory on
the traffic dynamics. A group of agents with memory exiting through a narrow

aggravates seismic damage level because corrosion significantly reduces the
pipeline strength. Most of the existing buried pipelines in the United States
are aged and non-ductile metallic pipelines, which are vulnerable to seismic
loading. To ensure continuous and smooth water supply to communities during and
after earthquakes, it is necessary to evaluate the system-level seismic
performance of WDS considering the aging effect in corroded pipelines. The
current study develops a new framework of estimating the seismic resilience of
WDS considering the time-variant effect of corrosion. The study formulates an
approach that : (1) determines the seismic failure probability of pipeline
using an extended American Lifelines Alliance (ALA) model that account for the
effects of time-dependent corrosion; and (2) estimates system-level seismic
performance based on pipeline reliability and edge betweenness centrality. The
proposed approach is illustrated with a scenario earthquake hazard for mid-size
WDS. The outcomes of the study reveal that the presence of corrosion on
pipelines significantly reduces the system-level seismic performance of WDS.

preserve quantum states for a remarkably long time. Here we report a
comprehensive study of the nuclear decoherence processes in the vicinity of the
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. We simulate from first principles the
change in the dynamics of nuclear spins as a function of distance and state of
the NV center and validate our results with experimental data. Our simulations
reveal nontrivial oscillations in the Hahn echo signal, pointing to a new
sensing modality of dynamical-decoupling spectroscopy, and show how
hybridization of the electronic states suppresses the coherence time of
strongly coupled nuclear spins. The computational framework developed in our
work is general and can be broadly applied to predict the dynamical properties
of nuclear spins.

implementation of machine learning in scientific applications. In particular,
estimating how a system might respond to external forcings or perturbations

novel solution to this challenge by utilizing a principle from statistical
physics known as the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to discover
knowledge using an AI model that can rapidly produce scenarios for different
external forcings. By leveraging FDT, we are able to extract information
encoded in a large dataset produced by Earth System Models, which includes 8250
years of internal climate fluctuations, to estimate the climate system's
response to forcings. Our model, AiBEDO, is capable of capturing the complex,
multi-timescale effects of radiation perturbations on global and regional
surface climate, allowing for a substantial acceleration of the exploration of
the impacts of spatially-heterogenous climate forcers. To demonstrate the
utility of AiBEDO, we use the example of a climate intervention technique
called Marine Cloud Brightening, with the ultimate goal of optimizing the
spatial pattern of cloud brightening to achieve regional climate targets and
prevent known climate tipping points. While we showcase the effectiveness of
our approach in the context of climate science, it is generally applicable to
other scientific disciplines that are limited by the extensive computational
demands of domain simulation models. Source code of AiBEDO framework is made

quantum superpositions of semiclassical states of spacetime geometry. Such

spatial configurations. In this paper we introduce a framework for describing
such ''quantum superpositions of spacetime states.'' We introduce the notion of
the relativity of spacetime superpositions, demonstrating that for states in
which the superposed amplitudes differ by a coordinate transformation, it is
always possible to re-express the scenario in terms of dynamics on a single,
fixed background. Our result unveils an inherent ambiguity in labelling such
superpositions as genuinely quantum-gravitational, which has been done
extensively in the literature, most notably with reference to recent proposals
to test gravitationally-induced entanglement. We apply our framework to the the
above mentioned scenarios looking at gravitationally-induced entanglement, the
problem of decoherence of gravitational sources, and clarify commonly
overlooked assumptions. In the context of decoherence of gravitational sources,
our result implies that the resulting decoherence is not fundamental, but
depends on the existence of external systems that define a relative set of
coordinates through which the notion of spatial superposition obtains physical
meaning.

methodological approaches to the estimation of the cost of human life is given.
Based on the analysis, a number of hypotheses have been advanced about the use
of statistical calculations to achieve the modeling objectives. Model
calculations are based on the example of Zaporozhye Oblast statistics for
2018-2019. The article elaborates the approach to the estimation of the
economic equivalent of the cost of living on the basis of demographic

of their application in the realities of the national economy. Using
Statistica, the regression equation parameters were determined for statistical

The calculation parameters were also found using the Excel office application,
using the Solution Finder option to justify the quantitative range of metric

humans. In indirect reciprocity, individuals use reputations to choose whether
or not to cooperate with a partner and update others' reputations. A major
question is how the rules to choose their actions and the rules to update
reputations evolve. In the public reputation case, where all individuals share
the evaluation of others, social norms called Simple Standing (SS) and Stern
Judging (SJ) have been known to maintain cooperation. However, in the case of
private assessment where individuals independently evaluate others, the
mechanism of maintenance of cooperation is still largely unknown. This study
theoretically shows for the first time that cooperation by indirect reciprocity
can be evolutionarily stable under private assessment. Specifically, we find
that SS can be stable, but SJ can never be. This is intuitive because SS can
correct interpersonal discrepancies in reputations through its simplicity. On
the other hand, SJ is too complicated to avoid an accumulation of errors, which
leads to the collapse of cooperation. We conclude that moderate simplicity is a
key to success in maintaining cooperation under the private assessment. Our
result provides a theoretical basis for evolution of human cooperation.

graph-based tasks exploit recurring subgraph patterns. Classical methods
usually boil down to a backtracking framework that needs to navigate a huge
search space with prohibitive computational costs. Some recent studies resort
to graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a low-dimensional representation for
both the query and input graphs, in order to predict the number of subgraph
isomorphisms on the input graph. However, typical GNNs employ a node-centric
message passing scheme that receives and aggregates messages on nodes, which is
inadequate in complex structure matching for isomorphism counting. Moreover, on
an input graph, the space of possible query graphs is enormous, and different
parts of the input graph will be triggered to match different queries. Thus,
expecting a fixed representation of the input graph to match diversely
structured query graphs is unrealistic. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN
called Count-GNN for subgraph isomorphism counting, to deal with the above
challenges. At the edge level, given that an edge is an atomic unit of encoding
graph structures, we propose an edge-centric message passing scheme, where
messages on edges are propagated and aggregated based on the edge adjacency to
preserve fine-grained structural information. At the graph level, we modulate
the input graph representation conditioned on the query, so that the input
graph can be adapted to each query individually to improve their matching.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a number of benchmark datasets to
demonstrate the superior performance of Count-GNN.

us to detect the 110-ms spin period of the pulsar, characterize its hard X-ray
pulse profile, and resolve hard X-ray emission from the PWN after removing
contamination from the pulsar and other overlapping point sources. The extended
PWN was detected up to $\sim$20 keV and is well described by a power-law model
with a photon index $\Gamma\approx$2. The PWN shape does not vary significantly
with energy, and its X-ray spectrum shows no clear evidence of softening away
from the pulsar. We modeled the spatial profile of X-ray spectra and broadband
spectral energy distribution in the radio to TeV band to infer the physical
properties of the PWN. We found that a model with low magnetic field strength
($B\sim 10$ $\mu$G) and efficient diffusion ($D\sim 10^{27}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$)
fits the PWN data well. The extended hard X-ray and TeV emission, associated

The topological semimetals (TSMs) host such properties owing to their unique
topological band structure such as Weyl points or nodal lines (NLs), that is
protected by certain symmetries of the crystal. When the NLs break out in the
system due to perturbation in Hamiltonian, a large Berry curvature arises in
the surrounding area of the gapped NL. In the present work, we studied
anomalous transport properties of Cu2CoSn compound, which has a cubic Heusler
crystal structure (space group: Fm-3m). The Cu2CoSn full Heusler compound
possesses three NLs in the absence of spin-orbit coupling close to the Fermi
level. These NLs gap out with the consideration of the SOC and a large Berry
curvature observed along the gapped NLs. The integral of Berry curvature gives
the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) about 1003 S/cm and the
anomalous Nernst conductivity (ANC) of about 3.98 A/m-K at the Fermi level.
These values of AHC and ANC are comparable to the largest reported values for
the Co2MnGa Heusler compound. Therefore, Cu2CoSn becomes a newborn member of
the family of full Heusler compounds, which possesses giant AHC and ANC that
can be useful for the spintronics application.

end-to-end procedure, segmenting reservoirs and identifying the region of
interest (RoI) around them are essential. In the proposed two-phase workflow,
the reservoir is initially segmented using a DL model. A post-processing stage
is proposed to remove errors such as floating vegetation. Next, the RoI around
the reservoir (RoIaR) is identified using the proposed image processing
techniques. Finally, the man-made objects in the RoIaR are segmented using a DL
architecture. We trained the proposed workflow using collected Google Earth
(GE) images of eight reservoirs in Brazil over two different years. The
U-Net-based and SegNet-based architectures are trained to segment the
reservoirs. To segment man-made objects in the RoIaR, we trained and evaluated
four possible architectures, U-Net, FPN, LinkNet, and PSPNet. Although the
collected data has a high diversity (for example, they belong to different
states, seasons, resolutions, etc.), we achieved good performances in both

reservoir segmentation improves the precision in all studied reservoirs except
two cases. We validated the prepared workflow with a reservoir dataset outside

available may have a different texture because of different dosage values or
scanner properties than the images that need to be segmented. This paper
presents a StyleGAN-driven approach for segmenting publicly available large
medical datasets by using readily available extremely small annotated datasets
in similar modalities. The approach involves augmenting the small segmented
dataset and eliminating texture differences between the two datasets. The
dataset is augmented by being passed through six different StyleGANs that are
trained on six different style images taken from the large non-annotated
dataset we want to segment. Specifically, style transfer is used to augment the
training dataset. The annotations of the training dataset are hence combined
with the textures of the non-annotated dataset to generate new anatomically
sound images. The augmented dataset is then used to train a U-Net segmentation
network which displays a significant improvement in the segmentation accuracy
in segmenting the large non-annotated dataset.

segmentation approaches, among which deep learning-based approaches have

However, obtaining an appropriately sized and fine-grained annotated dataset of
multiple organs is extremely hard and expensive. Such scarce annotation limits
the development of high-performance multi-organ segmentation models but
promotes many annotation-efficient learning paradigms. Among these, studies on
transfer learning leveraging external datasets, semi-supervised learning using
unannotated datasets and partially-supervised learning integrating
partially-labeled datasets have led the dominant way to break such dilemma in
multi-organ segmentation. We first review the traditional fully supervised
method, then present a comprehensive and systematic elaboration of the 3
abovementioned learning paradigms in the context of multi-organ segmentation
from both technical and methodological perspectives, and finally summarize
their challenges and future trends.

synthetic training images using diffusion models provides a potential solution

explanation is a potential significant domain gap between synthetic and real

insights that MA-ZSC performance can be improved by improving the diversity of
images in the generated dataset. We propose a set of modifications to the
text-to-image generation process using a pre-trained diffusion model to enhance
diversity, which we refer to as our $\textbf{bag of tricks}$. Our approach
shows notable improvements in various classification architectures, with
results comparable to state-of-the-art models such as CLIP. To validate our
approach, we conduct experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and EuroSAT, which is
particularly difficult for zero-shot classification due to its satellite image

treatment, however, is challenging due to complex structure variations and
varied imaging conditions. Supervised deep learning has demonstrated its
superior capacity in automatic 3D vessel segmentation. However, the reliance on
expensive 3D manual annotations and limited capacity for annotation reuse
hinder the clinical applications of supervised models. To avoid the repetitive
and laborious annotating and make full use of existing vascular annotations,
this paper proposes a novel 3D shape-guided local discrimination model for 3D
vascular segmentation under limited guidance from public 2D vessel annotations.
The primary hypothesis is that 3D vessels are composed of semantically similar
voxels and exhibit tree-shaped morphology. Accordingly, the 3D region
discrimination loss is firstly proposed to learn the discriminative
representation measuring voxel-wise similarities and cluster semantically
consistent voxels to form the candidate 3D vascular segmentation in unlabeled
images; secondly, based on the similarity of the tree-shaped morphology between
2D and 3D vessels, the Crop-and-Overlap strategy is presented to generate
reference masks from 2D structure-agnostic vessel annotations, which are fit
for varied vascular structures, and the adversarial loss is introduced to guide
the tree-shaped morphology of 3D vessels; thirdly, the temporal consistency
loss is proposed to foster the training stability and keep the model updated
smoothly. To further enhance the model's robustness and reliability, the
orientation-invariant CNN module and Reliability-Refinement algorithm are
presented. Experimental results from the public 3D cerebrovascular and 3D
arterial tree datasets demonstrate that our model achieves comparable
effectiveness against nine supervised models.

the order of 2-3 measured for thin slabs of 1 nm thickness do not highlight any
special property of water but can be recovered for a generic polar solvent
having similar particle size and the same high dielectric constant. Regarding
the transverse polarisation case where the perturbing field is parallel to the

converges to a function, which has a unique minimum and positive-definite
Hessian at the true source's position. Hence, it is promising to execute local
iterations, e.g., the Gauss-Newton (GN) algorithm, following a consistent
estimate. The main issue involved is obtaining a preliminary consistent
estimate. To this aim, we construct a linear least-squares problem via
algebraic operation and constraint relaxation and obtain a closed-form

least-squares estimator, which yields an asymptotically unbiased (thus
consistent) estimate. Noting that the bias is a function of the noise variance,
we further devise a consistent noise variance estimator which involves
$3$-order polynomial rooting. Based on the preliminary consistent location
estimate, we prove that a one-step GN iteration suffices to achieve the same
asymptotic property as the ML estimator. Simulation results demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed algorithm in the large sample case.

of the preserved input part to the original model prediction. For each input,
since only a set of model outputs are collected and aggregated, PAMI does not
require any model detail and can be applied to various prediction tasks with

Multiplier State-Space Substructuring (LM-SSS) formulation via compatibility
relaxation. This coupling approach makes it possible to incorporate into LM-SSS
connecting elements that are suitable for being characterized by inverse
substructuring (e.g. rubber mounts) by simply using information from one of its
off diagonal apparent mass terms. Therefore, the information obtained from an
in-situ experimental characterization of the CEs is enough to include them into
the coupling formulation. Moreover, LM-SSS with compatibility relaxation makes
it possible to couple an unlimited number of components and CEs, requiring only
one matrix inversion to compute the coupled state-space model (SSM). Two
post-processing procedures to enable the computation of minimal-order coupled
models by using this approach are also presented. Numerical and experimental
substructuring applications are exploited to prove the validity of the proposed
methods. It is found that the IS approach can be accurately applied on
state-space models representative of components linked by CEs to identify
models representative of the diagonal apparent mass terms of the CEs, provided
that the CEs can be accurately characterized by the underlying assumptions of
IS. In this way, state-space models representative of experimentally
characterized CEs can be found without performing decoupling operations. Hence,
these models are not contaminated with spurious states. Furthermore, it was
found that the developed coupling approach is reliable, when the dynamics of
the CEs can be accurately characterized by IS, thus making it possible to

drastically improve the efficiency of structural search in SA. CCOP uses a
graph neural network energy prediction model to reduce the DFT cost and a deep
reinforcement learning algorithm to direct the search path. Tests on six
multi-alloys show the energy prediction model is capable of extracting the
bonding characteristics of the complex alloys to achieve interpretability. It
also achieves high accuracy with a tiny training set (an increment of 30
samples per iteration) by active learning in less than 5 iterations. Comparison
with a few conventional methods shows that CCOP finds the lowest-energy

than SA. CCOP is promising for serving as a broadly applicable tool for the

paradigm for a group of agents to achieve a shared goal by taking individual
decisions, yet is found to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Though
harmful, adversarial attacks also play a critical role in evaluating the
robustness and finding blind spots of c-MARL algorithms. However, existing
attacks are not sufficiently strong and practical, which is mainly due to the
ignorance of complex influence between agents and cooperative nature of victims
in c-MARL.
  In this paper, we propose adversarial minority influence (AMI), the first
practical attack against c-MARL by introducing an adversarial agent. AMI
addresses the aforementioned problems by unilaterally influencing other
cooperative victims to a targeted worst-case cooperation. Technically, to
maximally deviate victim policy under complex agent-wise influence, our
unilateral attack characterize and maximize the influence from adversary to
victims. This is done by adapting a unilateral agent-wise relation metric
derived from mutual information, which filters out the detrimental influence
from victims to adversary. To fool victims into a jointly worst-case failure,
our targeted attack influence victims to a long-term, cooperatively worst case
by distracting each victim to a specific target. Such target is learned by a
reinforcement learning agent in a trial-and-error process. Extensive
experiments in simulation environments, including discrete control (SMAC),
continuous control (MAMujoco) and real-world robot swarm control demonstrate
the superiority of our AMI approach. Our codes are available in

attention in the online advertising industry. A real-time bidding (RTB) system

impressions. Within the RTB system, demand-side platforms (DSP) aim to spend
advertisers' campaign budgets efficiently while maximizing profit, seeking
impressions that result in high user responses, such as clicks or installs. In
the current study, we investigate the process of predicting a mobile gaming app
installation from the point of view of a particular DSP, while paying attention
to user privacy, and exploring the trade-off between privacy preservation and
model performance. There are multiple levels of potential threats to user
privacy, depending on the privacy leaks associated with the data-sharing
process, such as data transformation or de-anonymization. To address these
concerns, privacy-preserving techniques were proposed, such as cryptographic
approaches, for training privacy-aware machine-learning models. However, the
ability to train a mobile gaming app installation prediction model without
using user-level data, can prevent these threats and protect the users'
privacy, even though the model's ability to predict may be impaired.
Additionally, current laws might force companies to declare that they are
collecting data, and might even give the user the option to opt out of such
data collection, which might threaten companies' business models in digital
advertising, which are dependent on the collection and use of user-level data.
We conclude that privacy-aware models might still preserve significant
capabilities, enabling companies to make better decisions, dependent on the
privacy-efficacy trade-off utility function of each case.

  Adversaries","30 pages",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work addresses a reactive jamming attack on the low-latency messages of
a victim, wherein the jammer deploys countermeasure detection mechanisms to
change its strategy. We highlight that the existing schemes against reactive
jammers use relays with instantaneous full-duplex (FD) radios to evade the
attack. However, due to the limitation of the radio architecture of the FD
helper, instantaneous forwarding may not be possible in practice, thereby
leading to increased decoding complexity at the destination and a high
detection probability at the adversary. Pointing at this drawback, we propose a
delay-aware cooperative framework wherein the victim seeks assistance from a
delay-aware FD helper to forward its messages to the destination within the
latency constraints. In particular, we first model the processing delay at the
helper based on its hardware architecture, and then propose two low-complexity
mitigation schemes, wherein the victim and the helper share their uplink
frequencies using appropriate energy-splitting factors. For both the schemes,
we solve the optimization problems of computing the near-optimal
energy-splitting factors that minimize the joint error rates at the
destination. Finally, through analytical and simulation results, we show that
the proposed schemes facilitate the victim in evading the jamming attack whilst
deceiving the reactive adversary.

serious concerns is the environmental noise correlated between detectors. The
global electromagnetic fields on the Earth, known as Schumann resonances,
produce the correlated noise through the instrumental magnetic couplings. In
this paper, we study the detectability of a SGWB in the presence of the
correlated magnetic noise, using the Fisher analysis based on the analytical
model of the correlated magnetic noise. We find that there is no significant
degeneracy between the SGWB and noise parameters. Marginalizing over the
correlated noise parameters degrades the constraint on each SGWB parameter by a
factor of $\sim2$ at most in the four-detector case, irrespective of the
strength of the magnetic coupling. We also confirm that the forecast results
are robust against the variation of correlated noise parameters and can vary up
to $40\%$ in the realistic range of the coupling parameters for the
second-generation detectors. However, ignoring the correlated noise in
parameter estimation generally leads to a biased constraint on the SGWB
parameters. If the coupling strength is twice as large as expected, this could
result in a serious bias.

metadata information such as venues, authors, and references, which may serve
as additional signals to infer relevant tags. Although there have been studies

PDFFlow, is a Parton Distribution Functions interpolator, while MadFlow aims at
building a complete tool suite to accelerate the whole event generation

many different algorithms that work in synergy to extract a high-level
representation of detector data. All the most important experiments in neutrino
physics are developing software to automatically process and extract this

posterior marginals. We consider skew decomposable graphical models (SDGMs),
which are based on the closed skew normal family of distributions, as
variational approximations. These approximations can reflect the true posterior
conditional independence structure and capture posterior skewness. Different
parametrizations are explored for this variational family, and the speed of
convergence and quality of the approximation can depend on the parametrization
used. To increase flexibility, implicit copula SDGM approximations are also
developed, where elementwise transformations of an approximately standardized

Performance of the methods is examined in a number of real examples involving

  Mining Approach","Preprint. Under review",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Not all positive pairs are beneficial to time series contrastive learning. In
this paper, we study two types of bad positive pairs that impair the quality of
time series representation learned through contrastive learning ($i.e.$, noisy
positive pair and faulty positive pair). We show that, with the presence of
noisy positive pairs, the model tends to simply learn the pattern of noise
(Noisy Alignment). Meanwhile, when faulty positive pairs arise, the model
spends considerable efforts aligning non-representative patterns (Faulty
Alignment). To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Bad Pair Mining
(DBPM) algorithm, which reliably identifies and suppresses bad positive pairs
in time series contrastive learning. DBPM utilizes a memory module to track the
training behavior of each positive pair along training process. This allows us
to identify potential bad positive pairs at each epoch based on their
historical training behaviors. The identified bad pairs are then down-weighted
using a transformation module. Our experimental results show that DBPM
effectively mitigates the negative impacts of bad pairs, and can be easily used
as a plug-in to boost performance of state-of-the-art methods. Codes will be
made publicly available.

single evolution operator with a fixed time step. This paper aims to learn a
family of evolution operators with variable time steps, which constitute a
semigroup for an autonomous system. The semigroup property is very crucial and
links the system's evolutionary behaviors across varying time scales, but it
was not considered in the previous works. We propose for the first time a
framework of embedding the semigroup property into the data-driven learning
process, through a novel neural network architecture and new loss functions.
The framework is very feasible, can be combined with any suitable neural
networks, and is applicable to learning general autonomous ODEs and PDEs. We
present the rigorous error estimates and variance analysis to understand the
prediction accuracy and robustness of our approach, showing the remarkable
advantages of semigroup awareness in our model. Moreover, our approach allows
one to arbitrarily choose the time steps for prediction and ensures that the
predicted results are well self-matched and consistent. Extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that embedding the semigroup property notably reduces
the data dependency of deep learning models and greatly improves the accuracy,
robustness, and stability for long-time prediction.

near-axis description for axisymmetric and quasisymmetric magnetic

positive triangularity stabilises vertically elongated tokamaks. In
quasisymmetric stellarators, the toroidal asymmetry of flux surfaces modifies
this relation. The behaviour of stellarator-symmetric, quasisymmetric
stellarators can still be described in terms of the shape of one of their
up-down symmetric cross-sections. However, we show that for a sample of

contrast simultaneously is in great demand for one-way optical communication

perfect nonreciprocity that allows lossless unidirectional transmission by
engineering energy losses. The loss of the intermediate mode induces a phase
lag impinging on the indirect channel for energy transmission, which does not
depend on the energy transmission direction. When the direct transmission
channel coexists with the indirect lossy transmission channel, the dual-channel
interference can be tuned to be destructive simultaneously for backward
transmission from the rightmost mode to the leftmost mode, and for forward
transmission from the leftmost mode to the intermediate mode. The former
interference outcome corresponds to 100% nonreciprocity contrast, and the
latter guarantees zero insertion loss for forward transmission. Additionally,
our scheme also allows a nonreciprocity response over a wide bandwidth by
increasing the losses while keeping perfect nonreciprocity at resonance. The
robustness against loss indicates that our scheme is advantageous in the
implementation of nonreciprocal optical devices with high performance.

on the convergence of the empirical distribution of the population. To this
end, the premise is to obtain the optimal policies of a set of finite-agent
games with different population sizes. However, either deriving the closed-form
solution for each game is theoretically intractable, training a distinct policy
for each game is computationally intensive, or directly applying the policy
trained in a game to other games is sub-optimal. We address these challenges
through the Population-size-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO). Our contributions
are three-fold. First, to efficiently generate efficient policies for games
with different population sizes, we propose PAPO, which unifies two natural
options (augmentation and hypernetwork) and achieves significantly better
performance. PAPO consists of three components: i) the population-size encoding
which transforms the original value of population size to an equivalent
encoding to avoid training collapse, ii) a hypernetwork to generate a distinct
policy for each game conditioned on the population size, and iii) the
population size as an additional input to the generated policy. Next, we
construct a multi-task-based training procedure to efficiently train the neural
networks of PAPO by sampling data from multiple games with different population
sizes. Finally, extensive experiments on multiple environments show the
significant superiority of PAPO over baselines, and the analysis of the
evolution of the generated policies further deepens our understanding of the
two fields of finite-agent and infinite-agent games.

environments. We observed the ammonia (J,K)=(1,1), (2,2), and (3,3) inversion

the (1,1) transition toward 28 sources and the (2,2) transition toward 12
sources, while the (3,3) transition was detected toward only two sources. We
find kinetic temperatures between ~12 K and 21 K, ammonia column densities from

ammonia abundances with respect to H$_{2}$ from $4.7\times10^{-9}$ to
$1.5\times10^{-7}$. The results are comparable to those found in infrared dark

our sample reside in rather quiescent (sonic or transonic) host environments.

density maps confirm the presence of dense material toward 7 sources in our

Based on our results, we suggest observations targeting additional molecular
lines would help to refine the evolutionary classification of eruptive stars.

follow one or several moving, virtual conspecifics. These data are used to
inform, and test, a model of social response that includes a process of
explicit decision-making, whereby the fish can decide which of the virtual
conspecifics to follow, or to follow some average direction. This approach is
in contrast with previous models where the direction of motion was based on a
continuous computation, such as directional averaging. Building upon a
simplified version of this model [Sridhar et al. 2021], which was limited to a
one-dimensional projection of the fish motion, we present here a model that
describes the motion of the real fish as it swims freely in two-dimensions.
Motivated by experimental observations, the swim speed of the fish in this
model uses a burst-and-coast swimming pattern, with the burst frequency being
dependent on the distance of the fish from the followed conspecific(s). We
demonstrate that this model is able to explain the observed spatial
distribution of the real fish behind the virtual conspecifics in the
experiments. In particular, the model naturally explains the observed critical
bifurcations for a freely swimming fish, whenever the fish makes a decision to
follow only one of the virtual conspecifics, instead of following them as an
averaged group. This model can provide the foundation for modeling a cohesive
shoal of swimming fish, while explicitly describing their directional

engineers. Artificial intelligence provides new potential to facilitate process
design. Specifically, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown some success in
automating process design by integrating data-driven models that learn to build
process flowsheets with process simulation in an iterative design process.
However, one major challenge in the learning process is that the RL agent
demands numerous process simulations in rigorous process simulators, thereby
requiring long simulation times and expensive computational power. Therefore,
typically short-cut simulation methods are employed to accelerate the learning
process. Short-cut methods can, however, lead to inaccurate results. We thus
propose to utilize transfer learning for process design with RL in combination
with rigorous simulation methods. Transfer learning is an established approach
from machine learning that stores knowledge gained while solving one problem
and reuses this information on a different target domain. We integrate transfer
learning in our RL framework for process design and apply it to an illustrative
case study comprising equilibrium reactions, azeotropic separation, and
recycles, our method can design economically feasible flowsheets with stable
interaction with DWSIM. Our results show that transfer learning enables RL to
economically design feasible flowsheets with DWSIM, resulting in a flowsheet
with an 8% higher revenue. And the learning time can be reduced by a factor of
2.

mass, radius, effective temperature. It is an essential parameter for any
radial velocity monitoring, as stellar activity can mimic the presence of a
planet at the stellar rotation period. Several methods exist to measure it,
including long sequences of photometric measurements or temporal series of
stellar activity indicators. Aims. Here, we use the circular polarization in
near-infrared spectral lines for a sample of 43 quiet M dwarfs and compare the
measured rotation periods to those obtained with other methods. Methods. From
Stokes V spectropolarimetric sequences observed with SPIRou at CFHT and the
data processed with the APERO pipeline, we compute the least squares
deconvolution profiles using different masks of atomic stellar lines with known
Land\'e factor appropriate to the effective temperature of the star. We derive
the longitudinal magnetic field to examine its possible variation along the 50
to 200 observations of each star. For determining the stellar rotation period,
we apply a Gaussian process regression enabling us to determine the rotation
period of stars with evolving longitudinal field. Results. Among the 43 stars
of our sample, we were able to measure a rotation period for 27 stars. For 8
stars, the rotation period was previously unknown. We find a good agreement of
our rotation periods with periods found in the literature based on photometry
and activity indicators and confirm that near-infrared spectropolarimetry is an
important tool to measure rotation periods, even for magnetically quiet stars.
Furthermore, we compute ages for 20 stars of our sample using gyrochronology.

Hamiltonians, the maximally mixed state is a sufficiently good trial state, and
phase estimation efficiently prepares states with energy arbitrarily close to
the ground energy. Furthermore, any low-energy state must have nonnegligible
quantum circuit complexity, suggesting that low-energy states are classically
nontrivial and phase estimation is the optimal method for preparing such states
(up to polynomial factors). These statements hold for two models of random
Hamiltonians: (i) a sum of random signed Pauli strings and (ii) a random signed
$d$-sparse Hamiltonian. The main technical argument is based on some new
results in nonasymptotic random matrix theory. In particular, a refined
concentration bound for the spectral density is required to obtain complexity
guarantees for these random Hamiltonians.

$3.9 \pm 0.3$% (10.7$\sigma$), $5.5 \pm 0.6$% (9.1$\sigma$) and $4.5 \pm 0.4$%

band was found to be $\sim 143^{\circ}\pm 2^{\circ}$. The spectra were modelled
using a combination of thermal emission from an accretion disc, Comptonized
emission from a hot electron plasma (or corona) and a Gaussian line. From
spectro-polarimetric analysis, the polarization degree due to the disc emission
was found to have an upper limit of $\sim 9.1$%, and that of the Comptonized
emission was constrained at $8.7 \pm 3.3$% (at the 3$\sigma$ level). The
observed polarization angle and energy dependent polarization are in favour of
a slab-like coronal geometry which probably covers part of the accretion disc
and hides the neutron star surface. IXPE observation of the same source on 2022
October 8 does not show significant polarization which can be attributed to a
weakening of the coronal Comptonized emission. The implication of these results

the observation space, we propose a bidirectional neural skinning field based
on skeleton-driven deformation to establish the target-to-canonical and
canonical-to-observation correspondences. Then, we disentangle the canonical
body geometry into a normalized neutral-sized body and a subject-specific

closely related, we introduce pixel-aligned features to facilitate the body
geometry prediction and detailed surface normals to reinforce the RGB color

there exists a Bernoulli shift $T$, such that all moving averages $M(v_n,

  We refresh the reader about the cone condition established by Bellow, Jones,

$M(v_n,L_n)^T f$ with $L_n$ strictly increasing such that $(v_n,L_n)$ does not

  We show for any non-zero $f\in L^1(\mu)$, there is a generic class of ergodic
maps $T$ such that each map has an associated moving average $M(v_n, L_n)^T f$
which does not converge pointwise. It is known if $f\in L^2(\mu)$ is mean-zero,
then there exist solutions $T$ and $g\in L^1(\mu)$ to the coboundary equation:
$f = g - g\circ T$. This implies $f$ and $T$ produce universal moving averages.
We show this does not generalize to $L^p(\mu)$ for $p<2$ by explicitly defining
functions $f\in \cap_{p<2}L^p(\mu)$ such that for each ergodic measure
preserving $T$, there exists a moving average $M(v_n, L_n)^T f$ with $L_n\geq

ease the inversion challenge with StyleGAN-XL, Clustering \& Regularize

vector from the clusters, which generates an image close to the input image.
Then, an offset with a regularization term is introduced to keep the inverted
latent vector within a certain range. We validate our CRI scheme on multiple

complex natural images, and show preferable quantitative and qualitative
results. We further demonstrate our technique is robust in terms of data and

hierarchical systems (HSs) with more than two stars. In eccentric binary
systems, low mass discs that are sufficiently tilted to the binary orbit align
in a polar configuration with respect to the binary plane by aligning their
angular momentum to the binary eccentricity vector. In HSs, secular evolution
of the orbital parameters makes the eccentricity vector of the system precess
with time. This precession undermines the stability of the polar orbit for
accretion discs hosted in HSs. We analytically show that the binary criteria
for polar alignment derived in the literature are necessary but not sufficient
conditions for polar alignment in HSs. Then, we derive an analytical criterion
for polar alignment in HSs. In general, we find that discs orbiting the
innermost level of a HS can go polar. Conversely, radially extended discs
orbiting the outer levels of a HS cannot polarly align and evolve as orbiting
around a circular binary. We confirm our findings through detailed numerical
simulations. Also, our results are compatible with the observed distribution of
disc-orbit mutual inclination. Finally, we compare the observed distribution of
disc inclinations in the binary and in the HS populations. Binaries host mainly
coplanar discs, while HSs show a wide range of disc inclinations. We suggest
that the wider range of inclinations in HSs results from the secular
oscillation of their orbital parameters (such as Kozai-Lidov oscillations),
rather than from a different initial condition or evolution between HSs and
binaries.

(scalar-tensor) theory. In doing so, we rely upon the classical perturbative
techniques. We find, to our surprise, that inflation does not always ensure
stability in the Einstein frame, although ekpyrosis can. We also discover that,
contrary to the inflationary paradigm, ekpyrosis always assures stability in
the presence of any fluid with any equation of state in general non-minimal
models. We utilize the conformal transformation to map the inflationary theory
in the minimal frame to the ekpyrotic theory in the non-minimal frame, and show
that the latter is always much more stable than the former, resulting in a much
more preferred model that can even be studied in different contexts such as
late time cosmology.

that after the freezing of rotators an electric dipole is generated in each

polarization originates from the interlayer sliding. The net polarization of
these two components can be directly measured and manipulated. Our finding
provides insight into low-dimensional ferroelectrics, especially the
controlling of synchronous dynamics of rotating molecules and sliding layers in

source was in an off- or low-state between mid-2017 to mid-2020. During this
state, our pulse period monitoring shows that the source had spun down
considerably. We interpret this spin-down as likely being due to the propeller
effect, whereby accretion onto the neutron star surface is inhibited. Using
state-of-the-art accretion and torque models, we use the spin-up and spin-down
episodes to constrain the magnetic field. For the spin-up episode, we find
solutions for magnetic field strengths of either around 1e12G or 1e13G,
however, the strong spin-down during the off-state seems only to be consistent
with a very high magnetic field, namely, >1e13G. This is the first time a
strong spin-down is seen during a low flux state in a ULXP. Based on the
assumption that the source entered the propeller regime, this gives us the best
estimate so far for the magnetic field of NGC 5907 ULX1.

coordinate their behaviors in complex environments. However, common MARL
algorithms still suffer from scalability and sparse reward issues. One
promising approach to resolving them is automatic curriculum learning (ACL).
ACL involves a student (curriculum learner) training on tasks of increasing
difficulty controlled by a teacher (curriculum generator). Despite its success,
ACL's applicability is limited by (1) the lack of a general student framework
for dealing with the varying number of agents across tasks and the sparse
reward problem, and (2) the non-stationarity of the teacher's task due to
ever-changing student strategies. As a remedy for ACL, we introduce a novel
automatic curriculum learning framework, Skilled Population Curriculum (SPC),
which adapts curriculum learning to multi-agent coordination. Specifically, we
endow the student with population-invariant communication and a hierarchical
skill set, allowing it to learn cooperation and behavior skills from distinct
tasks with varying numbers of agents. In addition, we model the teacher as a
contextual bandit conditioned by student policies, enabling a team of agents to
change its size while still retaining previously acquired skills. We also
analyze the inherent non-stationarity of this multi-agent automatic curriculum
teaching problem and provide a corresponding regret bound. Empirical results
show that our method improves the performance, scalability and sample
efficiency in several MARL environments.

at the outer dead zone edge of protoplanetary discs is one of the leading
theories that explains horseshoe-like brightness distribution in transition
discs. Formation of such vortices requires a relatively sharp viscosity
transition. Detailed modelling, however, indicates that viscosity transitions
at the outer edge of the dead zone is relatively smooth. In this study, we
present 2D global, non-isothermal, gas-dust coupled hydrodynamic simulations to
investigate the possibility of vortex excitation at smooth viscosity
transitions. Our models are based on a recently postulated scenario, wherein
the recombination of charged particles on the surface of dust grains results in
reduced ionisation fraction and in turn the turbulence due to magnetorotational
instability. Thus, the alpha-parameter for the disc viscosity depends on the
local dust-to-gas mass ratio. We found that the smooth viscosity transitions at
the outer edge of the dead zone can become Rossby unstable and form vortices. A
single large-scale vortex develops if the dust content of the disc is well
coupled to the gas, however, multiple small-scale vortices ensue for the case
of less coupled dust. As both type of vortices are trapped at the dead zone
outer edge, they provide sufficient time for dust growth. The solid content
collected by the vortices can exceed several hundred Earth masses, while the
dust-to-gas density ratio within often exceeds unity. Thus, such vortices
function as planetary nurseries within the disc, providing ideal sites for
formation of planetesimals and eventually planetary systems.

boosted recommendation performance because of their ability to capture
long-term user-system interaction. However, the action space of the
recommendation policy is a list of items, which could be extremely large with a
dynamic candidate item pool. To overcome this challenge, we propose a
hyper-actor and critic learning framework where the policy decomposes the item
list generation process into a hyper-action inference step and an effect-action
selection step. The first step maps the given state space into a vectorized
hyper-action space, and the second step selects the item list based on the
hyper-action. In order to regulate the discrepancy between the two action
spaces, we design an alignment module along with a kernel mapping function for
items to ensure inference accuracy and include a supervision module to
stabilize the learning process. We build simulated environments on public
datasets and empirically show that our framework is superior in recommendation
compared to standard RL baselines.

  Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning to segment images purely by relying on the image-text alignment from
web data can lead to sub-optimal performance due to noise in the data. The
noise comes from the samples where the associated text does not correlate with
the image's visual content. Instead of purely relying on the alignment from the
noisy data, this paper proposes a novel loss function termed SimCon, which
accounts for intra-modal similarities to determine the appropriate set of
positive samples to align. Further, using multiple views of the image (created
synthetically) for training and combining the SimCon loss with it makes the
training more robust. This version of the loss is termed MV-SimCon. The
empirical results demonstrate that using the proposed loss function leads to
consistent improvements on zero-shot, text supervised semantic segmentation and
outperforms state-of-the-art by $+3.0\%$, $+3.3\%$ and $+6.9\%$ on PASCAL VOC,
PASCAL Context and MSCOCO, respectively. With test time augmentations, we set a
new record by improving these results further to $58.7\%$, $26.6\%$, and
$33.3\%$ on PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, and MSCOCO, respectively. In addition,
using the proposed loss function leads to robust training and faster
convergence.

Concerning the former, presented is the relevance of MS for determining borders
of the miscibility gap and kinetics of the phase decomposition, distinguishing
between nucleation and growth and spinodal decomposition, identifying the
sigma-phase and studying kinetics of its precipitation. Regarding the magnetic
phase diagram, MS is useful for determining the Curie, the N\'eel and the

exploration of agents to parts of the environment which require cooperation.
(2) Average value estimates across the ensemble serve as target values. These

affects the kinetic roughening. The medium is described by the stochastic

in the covariant derivative of the scalar field. The resulting action
functional involves four coupling constants and a dimensionless ratio of
kinematic coefficients. The one-loop calculation (the leading order of the

essential for predicting particle dynamics. However, a generally valid
formulation is lacking, as all available drag force correlations have been
established for specific flow situations. In particular, these correlations
have not been evaluated for particle-laden flows subjected to electrostatic
forces. The paper reports the effect of drag force modeling on the flow of
electrically charged particles. To this end, we implemented different drag
force correlations to the open-source CFD tool pafiX. Then, we performed
highly-resolved Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) using the
Eulerian-Lagrangian approach of a particle-laden channel flow with the friction
Reynolds number of 180. The simulations generally revealed a strong influence
of the precise drag correlation on particles in the near-wall region and a
minor effect on the particles far from the walls. Due to their turbophoretic
drift, particles accumulate close to the channel walls. For uncharged
particles, the simulations show large deviations of the particle concentration
profile in the near-wall region depending on the drag force correlation.
Therefore, the disturbance of the flow surrounding a particle by a nearby wall
or other particles is important for its drag. Driven by electrostatic forces,
charged particles accumulate even closer to the wall. Contrary to the uncharged

disjoint subsets, each subset spread in a way that it covers the whole set with
a certain radius. Given a finite set S, a metric d, and a radius r, define a
subset (of S) S' to be an r-cover if and only if forall s in S there exists s'
in S' such that d(s,s') is less or equal to r. We examine the problem of
determining whether there exist m disjoint r-covers, naming it the Solidarity
Cover Problem (SCP). We consider as well the related optimization problems of
maximizing the number of r-covers, referred to as the partition size, and
minimizing the radius. We analyze the relation between the SCP and a graph
problem known as the Domatic Number Problem (DNP), both hard problems in the
general case. We show that the SCP is hard already in the Euclidean 2D setting,
implying hardness of the DNP already in the unit-disc-graph setting. As far as
we know, the latter is a result yet to be shown. We use the tight approximation
bound of (1-o(1))/ln(n) for the DNP's general case, shown by U.Feige,
M.Halld'orsson, G.Kortsarz, and A.Srinivasan (SIAM Journal on computing, 2002),
to deduce the same bound for partition-size approximation of the SCP in the
Euclidean space setting. We show an upper bound of 3 and lower bounds of 2 and
sqrt(2) for approximating the minimal radius in different settings of the SCP.
Lastly, in the Euclidean 2D setting we provide a general
bicriteria-approximation scheme which allows a range of possibilities for
trading the optimality of the radius in return for better approximation of the
partition size and vice versa. We demonstrate a usage of the scheme which
achieves an approximation of (1/16,2) for the partition size and radius
respectively.

information to a number of clients, each of which contains local storage
(called cache) of some size, which can store some parts of the available files
at the server. The centralized coded caching framework, consists of a caching
phase and a delivery phase, both of which are carefully designed in order to
use the cache and the channel together optimally. In prior literature, various
combinatorial structures have been used to construct coded caching schemes. One
of the chief drawbacks of many of these existing constructions is the large
subpacketization level, which denotes the number of times a file should be
split for the schemes to provide coding gain. In this work, using a new binary
matrix model, we present several novel constructions for coded caching based on
the various types of combinatorial designs and their $q$-analogs, which are
also called subspace designs. While most of the schemes constructed in this
work (based on existing designs) have a high cache requirement, they provide a
rate that is either constant or decreasing, and moreover require competitively
small levels of subpacketization, which is an extremely important feature in
practical applications of coded caching. We also apply our constructions to the
distributed computing framework of MapReduce, which consists of three phases,
the Map phase, the Shuffle phase and the Reduce phase. Using our binary matrix
framework, we present a new simple generic coded data shuffling scheme.
Employing our designs-based constructions in conjunction with this new
shuffling scheme, we obtain new coded computing schemes which have low file
complexity, with marginally higher communication load compared to the optimal
scheme for equivalent parameters. We show that our schemes can neatly extend to
the scenario with full and partial stragglers also.

capture details of the entire scene, the resolutions of most ODIs are
insufficient. Previous methods attempt to solve this issue by image
super-resolution (SR) on equirectangular projection (ERP) images. However, they
omit geometric properties of ERP in the degradation process, and their models
can hardly generalize to real ERP images. In this paper, we propose Fisheye
downsampling, which mimics the real-world imaging process and synthesizes more
realistic low-resolution samples. Then we design a distortion-aware Transformer
(OSRT) to modulate ERP distortions continuously and self-adaptively. Without a
cumbersome process, OSRT outperforms previous methods by about 0.2dB on PSNR.
Moreover, we propose a convenient data augmentation strategy, which synthesizes
pseudo ERP images from plain images. This simple strategy can alleviate the
over-fitting problem of large networks and significantly boost the performance
of ODISR. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art

  Our first result is to improve the efficiency guarantees of the Polyhedral

plant organization. The environment affected R plant productivity differently
than in the susceptible, S, biotype. A consistent, differential, pattern of

Photosynthetic superiority of a biotype was a function of the time of day,
plant age temperature. Under highly favorable environmental conditions S often
had the advantage over R. Under less favorable, stressful, conditions R can be
at an advantage over S. Pleiotropic reorganization revealed a sun-air-leaf

large-scale data, wherein sampling hard examples usually not only accelerates
the convergence but also improves the model accuracy. Nevertheless, the reasons
for the effectiveness of Hard Negative Sampling (HNS) have not been revealed
yet. In this work, we fill the research gap by conducting thorough theoretical
analyses on HNS. Firstly, we prove that employing HNS on the Bayesian
Personalized Ranking (BPR) learner is equivalent to optimizing One-way Partial
AUC (OPAUC). Concretely, the BPR equipped with Dynamic Negative Sampling (DNS)
is an exact estimator, while with softmax-based sampling is a soft estimator.
Secondly, we prove that OPAUC has a stronger connection with Top-K evaluation
metrics than AUC and verify it with simulation experiments. These analyses
establish the theoretical foundation of HNS in optimizing Top-K recommendation
performance for the first time. On these bases, we offer two insightful
guidelines for effective usage of HNS: 1) the sampling hardness should be
controllable, e.g., via pre-defined hyper-parameters, to adapt to different
Top-K metrics and datasets; 2) the smaller the $K$ we emphasize in Top-K
evaluation metrics, the harder the negative samples we should draw. Extensive
experiments on three real-world benchmarks verify the two guidelines.

segmentation with Deep Learning. This requirement makes it difficult to run
state-of-the-art segmentation models in resource-constrained scenarios like
primary care facilities in rural areas and during crises. The recently emerging
field of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) has shown that locally interacting
one-cell models can achieve competitive results in tasks such as image
generation or segmentations in low-resolution inputs. However, they are
constrained by high VRAM requirements and the difficulty of reaching
convergence for high-resolution images. To counteract these limitations we
propose Med-NCA, an end-to-end NCA training pipeline for high-resolution image
segmentation. Our method follows a two-step process. Global knowledge is first
communicated between cells across the downscaled image. Following that,
patch-based segmentation is performed. Our proposed Med-NCA outperforms the
classic UNet by 2% and 3% Dice for hippocampus and prostate segmentation,
respectively, while also being 500 times smaller. We also show that Med-NCA is
by design invariant with respect to image scale, shape and translation,
experiencing only slight performance degradation even with strong shifts; and
is robust against MRI acquisition artefacts. Med-NCA enables high-resolution
medical image segmentation even on a Raspberry Pi B+, arguably the smallest
device able to run PyTorch and that can be powered by a standard power bank.

proposed an ensemble pipeline, VertXNet, that combines two state-of-the-art

materials. For instance, a quantum spin Hall insulator features a bulk
insulating gap with gapless helical boundary states protected by the underlying
Z2 topology. However, the bulk-boundary dichotomy and distinction are rarely
explored in optical experiments, which can provide unique information about
topological charge carriers beyond transport and electronic spectroscopy
techniques. Here, we utilize mid-infrared absorption micro-spectroscopy and
pump-probe micro-spectroscopy to elucidate the bulk-boundary optical responses
of Bi4Br4, a recently discovered room-temperature quantum spin Hall insulator.
Benefiting from the low energy of infrared photons and the high spatial
resolution, we unambiguously resolve a strong absorption from the boundary
states while the bulk absorption is suppressed by its insulating gap. Moreover,
the boundary absorption exhibits a strong polarization anisotropy, consistent
with the one-dimensional nature of the topological boundary states. Our
infrared pump-probe microscopy further measures a substantially increased
carrier lifetime for the boundary states, which reaches one nanosecond scale.
The nanosecond lifetime is about one to two orders longer than that of most
topological materials and can be attributed to the linear dispersion nature of
the helical boundary states. Our findings demonstrate the optical bulk-boundary
dichotomy in a topological material and provide a proof-of-principal
methodology for studying topological optoelectronics.

on a fixed dataset in an offline manner. However, in real-world scenarios, new
code repositories emerge incessantly, and the carried new knowledge is
beneficial for providing up-to-date code intelligence services to developers.
In this paper, we aim at the following problem: How to enable code intelligence
models to continually learn from ever-increasing data? One major challenge here
is catastrophic forgetting, meaning that the model can easily forget knowledge
learned from previous datasets when learning from the new dataset. To tackle
this challenge, we propose REPEAT, a novel method for continual learning of
code intelligence models. Specifically, REPEAT addresses the catastrophic
forgetting problem with representative exemplars replay and adaptive parameter
regularization. The representative exemplars replay component selects
informative and diverse exemplars in each dataset and uses them to retrain
model periodically. The adaptive parameter regularization component recognizes
important parameters in the model and adaptively penalizes their changes to
preserve the knowledge learned before. We evaluate the proposed approach on
three code intelligence tasks including code summarization, software
vulnerability detection, and code clone detection. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that REPEAT consistently outperforms baseline methods on all tasks.
For example, REPEAT improves the conventional fine-tuning method by 1.22, 5.61,
and 1.72 on code summarization, vulnerability detection and clone detection,
respectively.

The modeling
of disk fragmentation, a possible mechanism leading to stellar multiplicity,
relies on parallel 3D simulation codes whose agreement remains to be evaluated.
Using the Cartesian AMR code RAMSES, we compare disk fragmentation in a
centrally-condensed protostellar system to the study of Oliva & Kuiper (2020)
performed on a grid in spherical coordinates using PLUTO. Two RAMSES runs are
considered and give qualitatively distinct pictures. When allowing for
unlimited sink particle creation, gas fragmentation leads to a multiple stellar
system whose multiplicity is affected by the grid when triggering fragmentation
and by numerically-assisted mergers. On the other hand, using a unique,
central, fixed sink particle, a centrally-condensed system forms, similar to
that reported in PLUTO. The RAMSES-PLUTO comparison is performed with the
latter: agreement between the two codes is found regarding the first
rotationally-supported disk formation, the presence of an accretion shock onto
it, the first fragmentation phase. Gaseous fragments form and their properties
are in agreement between the two codes. As a minor difference, fragments
dynamics causes the disk structure to be sub-Keplerian in RAMSES whereas it is
found to be Keplerian and reaches quiescence in PLUTO. We attribute this
discrepancy to the central star being twice less massive in RAMSES because of
the different stellar accretion subgrid models. In a centrally-condensed
system, the agreement between RAMSES and PLUTO regarding many of the collapse
properties and fragmentation process is good. Fragmentation occurring in the
innermost region and numerical choices (use of sink particles, grid) have a
crucial impact when similar but smooth initial conditions are employed - more
crucial than the code's choice - on the system's outcome, multiple or
centrally-condensed.

behaviour of linear DNA constructs changes as we tune the mechanical properties
of the constituent DNA by changing the nucleotide sequence. The IN phase
transition can be suppressed in so-called DNA 'nunchakus': structures
consisting of two rigid dsDNA arms, separated by a sufficiently flexible
spacer. In this paper, we use simulations to explore what phase behavior to
expect for different linear DNA constructs. To this end, we first performed
numerical simulations exploring the structural properties of a number of
different DNA oligonucleotides, using the oxDNA package. We then used the
structural information generated in the oxDNA simulations to construct more
coarse-grained models of the rodlike, bent-core, and nunchaku DNA. These
coarse-grained models were used to explore the phase behavior of suspensions of
the various DNA constructs. The approach explored in this paper makes it
possible to 'design' the phase behavior of DNA constructs by a suitable choice
of the constituent nucleotide sequence.

embedding-based retrieval (EBR) applications where the vectors are generated
from trained models, $D=256\sim 1024$ are common. In this paper, OPORP (one
permutation + one random projection) uses a variant of the ``count-sketch''
type of data structures for achieving data reduction/compression. With OPORP,
we first apply a permutation on the data vectors. A random vector $r$ is
generated i.i.d. with moments: $E(r_i) = 0, E(r_i^2)=1, E(r_i^3) =0,
E(r_i^4)=s$. We multiply (as dot product) $r$ with all permuted data vectors.
Then we break the $D$ columns into $k$ equal-length bins and aggregate (i.e.,
sum) the values in each bin to obtain $k$ samples from each data vector. One
crucial step is to normalize the $k$ samples to the unit $l_2$ norm. We show
that the estimation variance is essentially: $(s-1)A +
\frac{D-k}{D-1}\frac{1}{k}\left[ (1-\rho^2)^2 -2A\right]$, where $A\geq 0$ is a
function of the data ($u,v$). This formula reveals several key properties: (1)
We need $s=1$. (2) The factor $\frac{D-k}{D-1}$ can be highly beneficial in
reducing variances. (3) The term $\frac{1}{k}(1-\rho^2)^2$ is a substantial
improvement compared with $\frac{1}{k}(1+\rho^2)$, which corresponds to the
un-normalized estimator. We illustrate that by letting the $k$ in OPORP to be
$k=1$ and repeat the procedure $m$ times, we exactly recover the work of ``very
spars random projections'' (VSRP). This immediately leads to a normalized
estimator for VSRP which substantially improves the original estimator of VSRP.
  In summary, with OPORP, the two key steps: (i) the normalization and (ii) the
fixed-length binning scheme, have considerably improved the accuracy in
estimating the cosine similarity, which is a routine (and crucial) task in
modern embedding-based retrieval (EBR) applications.

algebraic, Diophantine e.a.) can be reduced to calculation of the ``number of
solutions'' of systems of equations, defined by algebraic equalities and
differential equations with algebraic right hand sides (both ordinary and
Pfaffian). In the purely algebraic context the paradigm is given by the
B\'ezout theorem: the number of isolated solutions of a system of polynomial
equations of degree $\le d$ in the $n$-dimensional space does not exceed $d^n$,
the bound polynomial in $d$ and exponential in $n$. This bound is optimal: if
we count solutions properly (i.e., with multiplicities, including complex
solutions and solutions on the infinite hyperplane), then the equality holds.
  This paradigm can be generalized for the transcendental case as described
above. It turns out some counting problems admit similar bounds depending only
on the degrees and dimensions, whereas other can be treated only locally, i.e.,
admit bounds for the number of solutions in some domains of limited size. There
is only one class of counting problems, which admits global bounds, but besides
the degree and dimension, the answer depends on the height of the corresponding
Pfaffian system.
  The unifying feature for these results is the core fact that lies at the
heart of their proofs. This fact can be regarded as a variety of distant
generalizations of the Rolle theorem known from the undergraduate calculus,
claiming that between any two roots of a univariate differentiable function on
a segment must lie a root of its derivative. We discuss generalizations of the
Rolle theorem for vector-valued and complex analytic functions (none of them
straightforward) and for germs of holomorphic maps.

In this work, an alternative formulation of numerical propagators for classical
molecular dynamics is introduced based on an expansion of the time evolution
operator in series of Chebyshev and Newton polynomials. The suggested
propagators have, in principle, arbitrary order of accuracy which can be
controlled by the choice of expansion order after that the series is truncated.
However, the expansion converges only after a minimum number of terms is
included in the expansion and this number increases linearly with the time step
size. Measurements of the energy drift demonstrate the acceptable long-time
stability of the polynomial propagators. It is shown that a system of
interacting Lennard-Jones particles is tractable by the proposed technique and
that the scaling with the expansion order is only polynomial while the scaling
with the number of particles is the same as with the conventional velocity
Verlet. The proposed method is, in principle, extendable for further
interaction force fields and for integration with a thermostat, and can be
parallelized to speed up the computation of every time step.

more flexible since key-cast need not require source reconstruction at

  The work at hand considers key dissemination in the single-source,
multiple-multicast network coding setting, i.e., the ``multiple key-cast''
problem. Here, distinct keys are to be simultaneously transmitted from a single

Scenarios include the secure setting, in which only the source and intended
destinations gain information about a given key; and the non-secure setting in
which the only requirement is that the knowledge of one key does not reveal
information about another. In both settings, we present combinatorial
conditions for key dissemination and design corresponding multiple key-cast
schemes. In addition, we compare the multiple key-cast rate with and without

ensemble of SO(2) dual 4-vector gauge potentials which does away with the need
of Dirac string singularities for magnetic monopoles, a local Lagrangian action
principle for SO(2) dual electromagnetism is known, which manifestly displays
all the required space-time and internal symmetries, and reduces to the
experimentally well established Maxwell electrodynamics in the absence of
magnetic charges and currents. Applying the same considerations for the matter
action of electrically and magnetically charged point particles, a unique SO(2)
dual generalised Lorentz force is identified for SO(2) dual electrodynamics,
truly different from the usual SO(2) dual invariant choice motivated by
simplicity, but yet made arbitrarily and which does not derive from some action
principle. This generalised Lorentz force involves a single real and new
coupling constant of unknown value, without the requirement of a
Dirac-Schwinger-Zwanziger quantisation condition for electric and magnetic
charges of dyons. A physical consequence for SO(2) dual electrodynamics of this
coupling constant if nonvanishing, is to open a channel, or portal between the
otherwise mutually totally ``dark'' sectors of electric and magnetic charges
for electromagnetic interactions.

  Our result builds on a recently developed game-theoretic characterization of
monadically stable graph classes. As a second key ingredient of independent
interest, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for approximating weak

recursive locality-based model checking algorithm. This algorithm is efficient
on every monadically stable graph class admitting flip-closed sparse weak

Thereby, establishing efficient first-order model checking on monadically

neighborhood covers on these classes - a purely combinatorial problem. We
complete the picture by proving the existence of the desired covers for
structurally nowhere dense classes: we show that every structurally nowhere

three techniques that help speed up effective learning of the new languages and
alleviate catastrophic forgetting despite vocabulary and architecture

(2) applying learning rate scaling, and (3) performing data up-sampling, it is
possible to exceed the performance of a same-sized baseline model with 30%

with over 50% reduction in computation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
the introduced techniques help learn the new directions more effectively and
alleviate catastrophic forgetting at the same time. We hope our work will guide
research into more efficient approaches to growing languages for these MMT

social well-being because of the reduced human activity due to extreme events.
Community resilience is an important concept to understand and quantify the
impacts of an extreme event to population activity. Resilience is generally
defined as the ability of a system to manage shocks and return to a steady
state in response to an extreme event. In this paper, we analyze aggregate
location data from Facebook in response to Hurricane Ida. Using changes in the
number of Facebook users before, during, and after the disaster, we empirically
define and quantify community resilience as a function of the magnitude of
impact and the time to recover from the extreme situation. We measure
resilience and the transient loss of resilience in population activity for the
affected communities in Louisiana. The loss in resilience of the affected
communities was explained by three types of factors, including disruption in
physical infrastructures, disaster conditions due to hurricanes, and
socio-economic characteristics of a community. We find that a greater loss in
community resilience is associated with factors such as disruptions in power
and transportation services and disaster conditions. We also find socioeconomic
disparities in loss of resilience with respect to median income of a community.
Understanding community resilience using the decreased population activity
levels due to a disaster and the factors associated with loss in community
resilience will allow us to improve hazard preparedness, enhance disaster
management practices, and create better recovery policies towards strengthening
infrastructure and community resilience.

from an input image, whereby the contents of the image are causally explained
in terms of models of instantiated objects, each with their own type, shape,
appearance and pose, along with global variables like scene lighting and camera
parameters. This approach also requires scene models which account for the
co-occurrences and inter-relationships of objects in a scene. The SGM approach
has the merits that it is compositional and generative, which lead to
interpretability.
  To pursue the SGM agenda, we need models for objects and scenes, and
approaches to carry out inference. We first review models for objects, which
include ``things'' (object categories that have a well defined shape), and
``stuff'' (categories which have amorphous spatial extent). We then move on to
review \emph{scene models} which describe the inter-relationships of objects.
Perhaps the most challenging problem for SGMs is \emph{inference} of the
objects, lighting and camera parameters, and scene inter-relationships from

Multi-sequence cardiac magnetic resonance (MS-CMR) images can provide valuable

present clear anatomical boundaries, while late gadolinium enhancement and
T2-weighted CMR sequences visualize myocardial scar and edema of MI,
respectively. Existing methods usually fuse anatomical and pathological
information from different CMR sequences for MyoPS, but assume that these
images have been spatially aligned. However, MS-CMR images are usually
unaligned due to the respiratory motions in clinical practices, which poses
additional challenges for MyoPS. This work presents an automatic MyoPS
framework for unaligned MS-CMR images. Specifically, we design a combined
computing model for simultaneous image registration and information fusion,
which aggregates multi-sequence features into a common space to extract
anatomical structures (i.e., myocardium). Consequently, we can highlight the
informative regions in the common space via the extracted myocardium to improve
MyoPS performance, considering the spatial relationship between myocardial
pathologies and myocardium. Experiments on a private MS-CMR dataset and a
public dataset from the MYOPS2020 challenge show that our framework could
achieve promising performance for fully automatic MyoPS.

applying the effective field theory (EFT) approach in a systematic way. We
revisit the generalized EFT framework of modified teleparallel gravity, and we
apply it by considering both linear and second-order perturbations for both
theories. In the case of $f(T)$ gravity we find that no new scalar mode is
present in both linear and second order perturbations, which suggests a strong
coupling problem. However, based on the ratio of cubic to quadratic
Lagrangians, we provide a simple estimation of the strong coupling scale, a
result which shows that the strong coupling problem can be avoided at least for
some modes. Additionally, in the case of $f(T,B)$ gravity we find that in
general the extra scalar mode vanishes at quadratic order, but it becomes
dynamical at higher orders, which implies that a strong coupling issue may
appear, however estimating the strong coupling scale could provide a way to
avoid it. Furthermore, we show that there are special subclasses of $f(T,B)$
gravity, including $f(R)$ case, which possess an extra propagating mode at
linear perturbation level and thus are immediately free from strong coupling.
In conclusion, perturbation behaviors that at first appear problematic may not
inevitably lead to a strong coupling problem, as long as the relevant scale is

membrane viscosity on both deformation and loading time strongly depends on the

temporal contextual and periodic rPPG clues, we also extend the PhysFormer to
the two-pathway SlowFast based PhysFormer++ with temporal difference periodic

distribution learning and a curriculum learning inspired dynamic constraint in

PhysFormer++ and alleviate overfitting. Comprehensive experiments are performed
on four benchmark datasets to show our superior performance on both intra- and

from large-scale datasets, the proposed PhysFormer family can be easily trained
from scratch on rPPG datasets, which makes it promising as a novel transformer

images of a Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole in the bulk from a given response
function on one side of the AdS boundary, where the response function is

amplitude of total response function, it shows that there always exists the
interference pattern when the scalar wave propagates in the bulk spacetime and
diffracts under the action of the gravitational body. The absolute amplitude
depends closely on the properties of the source and spacetime geometry. More
importantly, one can find that the holographic images always appears as a ring
with the concentric stripe surrounded when the observer located at the north
pole, and an extremely bright ring appears at the position of the photon sphere
of the black hole. With the change of observation position, this ring will
change into a luminosity-deformed ring, or $2+$ light points. In addition, the

attention due to its superiority in capturing hierarchies. However, some
important operations in hyperbolic space still lack good definitions, making
existing methods unable to fully leverage the merits of hyperbolic space.
Specifically, they suffer from two main limitations: 1) existing Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in hyperbolic space rely on tangent space
approximation, which would incur approximation error in representation
learning, and 2) due to the lack of inner product operation definition in
hyperbolic space, existing methods can only measure the plausibility of facts
(links) with hyperbolic distance, which is difficult to capture complex data
patterns. In this work, we contribute: 1) a Full Poincar\'{e} Multi-relational
GCN that achieves graph information propagation in hyperbolic space without
requiring any approximation, and 2) a hyperbolic generalization of Euclidean
inner product that is beneficial to capture both hierarchical and complex

is to present an elementary summary of a few recent results obtained through
the application of the formal theory of systems of OD or PD equations and Lie
pseudogroups to engineering (elasticity, electromagnetism) or mathematical
physics (general relativity, gauge theory) and their couplings
(piezoelectricity, photoelasticity). The work of Cartan is superseded by the
use of the canonical Spencer sequence while the work of Vessiot is superseded
by the use of the canonical Janet sequence but the link between these two
sequences and thus these two works is still not known today. Using differential
duality in the linear framework, the adjoint of the Spencer operator for the
group of conformal transformations provides the Cosserat equations, the Maxwell
equations and the Weyl equations on equal footing. Such a result allows to
unify the finite elements of engineering sciences but also leads to deep
contradictions in the case of gravitational waves. Indeed, the Beltrami
operator (1892) which is parametrizing the Cauchy operator of elasticity by
means of 6 stress functions is nothing else than the self-adjoint Einstein
operator (1915) in dimension 3 for the deformation of the metric which is
parametrizing the div operator induced from the Bianchi identities. The same
confusion between the Cauchy and div operators is existing on space-time as the
Cauchy operator can be parametrized by the adjoint of the Ricci operator.
Accordingly, the foundations of engineering and mathematical physics must be
revisited within this new framework, though striking it may sometimes look
like.

inexorably rises as the proto-neutron star (PNS) core shrinks. We demonstrate
that the GW emission is excited mostly by accretion plumes onto the PNS that
energize modal oscillations and also high-frequency (``haze"") emission
correlated with the phase of violent accretion. The duration of the major phase
of emission varies with exploding progenitor and there is a strong correlation
between the total GW energy radiated and the compactness of the progenitor.
Moreover, the total GW emissions vary by as much as three orders of magnitude
from star to star. For black-hole formation, the GW signal tapers off slowly
and does not manifest the haze seen for the exploding models. For such failed
models, we also witness the emergence of a spiral shock motion that modulates

  of NeuralODEs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Using vanilla NeuralODEs to model large and/or complex systems often fails
due two reasons: Stability and convergence. NeuralODEs are capable of
describing stable as well as instable dynamic systems. Selecting an appropriate
numerical solver is not trivial, because NeuralODE properties change during
training. If the NeuralODE becomes more stiff, a suboptimal solver may need to
perform very small solver steps, which significantly slows down the training
process. If the NeuralODE becomes to instable, the numerical solver might not
be able to solve it at all, which causes the training process to terminate.
Often, this is tackled by choosing a computational expensive solver that is
robust to instable and stiff ODEs, but at the cost of a significantly decreased
training performance. Our method on the other hand, allows to enforce ODE
properties that fit a specific solver or application-related boundary
conditions. Concerning the convergence behavior, NeuralODEs often tend to run
into local minima, especially if the system to be learned is highly dynamic
and/or oscillating over multiple periods. Because of the vanishing gradient at
a local minimum, the NeuralODE is often not capable of leaving it and converge
to the right solution. We present a technique to add knowledge of ODE
properties based on eigenvalues - like (partly) stability, oscillation
capability, frequency, damping and/or stiffness - to the training objective of
a NeuralODE. We exemplify our method at a linear as well as a nonlinear system
model and show, that the presented training process is far more robust against
local minima, instabilities and sparse data samples and improves training
convergence and performance.

properties in fractured porous media. We generated a set of generic
three-dimensional discrete fracture networks at various densities, where the
radii of the fractures were sampled from a truncated power-law distribution,
and whose parameters were loosely based on field site characterizations. We
also considered five network densities, which were defined using a
dimensionless version of density based on percolation theory. Once the networks
were generated, we upscaled them into a single continuum model using the
upscaled discrete fracture matrix model presented by Sweeney et al. We
considered steady, isothermal pressure-driven flow through each domain and then
simulated conservative, decaying, and adsorbing tracers using a pulse injection
into the domain. For each simulation, we calculated the effective permeability
and solute breakthrough curves as quantities of interest to compare between
network realizations. We found that selecting a mesh resolution such that the
global topology of the upscaled mesh matches the fracture network is essential.
If the upscaled mesh has a connected pathway of fracture (higher permeability)
cells but the fracture network does not, then the estimates for effective
permeability and solute breakthrough will be incorrect. False connections
cannot be eliminated entirely, but they can be managed by choosing appropriate
mesh resolution and refinement for a given network. Adopting octree meshing to
obtain sufficient levels of refinement leads to fewer computational cells (up
to a 90% reduction in overall cell count) when compared to using a uniform
resolution grid and can result in a more accurate continuum representation of

  curling rock on ice surface","9page 7figure",,,,"physics.geo-ph physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a new model based on Quasi liquid layer to explain
why the direction of lateral motion of the curling rock on ice surface is
opposite to the other material surface. As we know, under the action of
inertial force, the pressure on the ice surface in front of curling is greater
than that on the back. So we assert that the firction coefficientin front of
curling is lower than that on the bank under different pressure. In order to
explain the pressure impact on friction coefficient, we qualitatively account
for the reason why the coefficient of friction increases under the pressure and
approximately calculated the relationship between the pressure and the
thickness of the quasi_liquid layer on the ice surface. Then we calculate the
function expression between temperature , pressure and the firction coefficient
by the function between temperature and friction coefficient.

property-we call 'memory'-of any physical system to respond to external
perturbations by keeping track of how it has reacted at previous times. Its
digital, scalable version maps a finite string of symbols into a finite string
of symbols. In this paper, I will discuss some analogies of the operation of
MemComputing machines-in general, and digital in particular-with a few physical
properties of the biological brain. These analogies could be a source of
inspiration to improve on the design of these machines. In turn, they could
suggest new directions of study in (computational) neuroscience.

J2 plasticity is presented using the nonlocal operator method. A variational
derivation of J2 plasticity at finite strain with a phase field model is
performed. The method includes a logarithmic strain tensor and an exponential
mapping in the plasticity evolution. A spectral decomposition based algorithm
for computing the first and second order derivatives of the composite matrix
function is implemented. A consistent tangential stiffness matrix is derived
and used in Newton-Raphson iterations. Several numerical examples are performed
to validate the method, including notched single-edged plates with brittle
fracture or ductile fracture and necking of a bar with/without phase field
model.

Shaikh, Sara Sabrina Zemljic and Stephen Clark","Formalising and Learning a Quantum Model of Concepts",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this report we present a new modelling framework for concepts based on
quantum theory, and demonstrate how the conceptual representations can be
learned automatically from data. A contribution of the work is a thorough
category-theoretic formalisation of our framework. We claim that the use of
category theory, and in particular the use of string diagrams to describe
quantum processes, helps elucidate some of the most important features of our
quantum approach to concept modelling. Our approach builds upon Gardenfors'
classical framework of conceptual spaces, in which cognition is modelled
geometrically through the use of convex spaces, which in turn factorise in
terms of simpler spaces called domains. We show how concepts from the domains
of shape, colour, size and position can be learned from images of simple
shapes, where individual images are represented as quantum states and concepts
as quantum effects. Concepts are learned by a hybrid classical-quantum network
trained to perform concept classification, where the classical image processing
is carried out by a convolutional neural network and the quantum
representations are produced by a parameterised quantum circuit. We also use
discarding to produce mixed effects, which can then be used to learn concepts
which only apply to a subset of the domains, and show how entanglement
(together with discarding) can be used to capture interesting correlations
across domains. Finally, we consider the question of whether our quantum models
of concepts can be considered conceptual spaces in the Gardenfors sense.

  Using Motion Sensors",,,,,"eess.SP cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recent growth in popularity of mobile and wearable devices has re-ignited the
need for reliable and stealthy communication side-channels to enable
applications such as secret/PIN sharing, co-location proofs and user
authentication. Existing short-range wireless radio technology such as
Bluetooth/BLE and NFC, although mature and robust, is prone to eavesdropping,
jamming and/or interference, and is not very useful as a covert communication
side-channel. This paper designs and implements SkinSense, a vibration-based
communication protocol which uses human body/skin as a communication medium to
create a low-bandwidth and covert communication channel between user-held
mobile and wearable devices. SkinSense employs a novel frequency modulation
technique for encoding bits as vibration pulses and a spectrogram-based
approach to decode the sensed motion data (corresponding to the encoded
vibration pulses) to reconstruct the transmitted bits. SkinSense is
comprehensively evaluated for a variety of operational parameters, hardware
setups and communication settings by means of data collected from human subject
participants. Results from these empirical evaluations demonstrate that
SkinSense is able to achieve a stable bandwidth of upto 6.6 bps, with bit error
rates below 0.1 in our custom hardware setup, and can be employed as a
practical communication side-channel.

  2022, Article number 109419","10.1016/j.ymssp.2022.109419",,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this article, the formulation of Lagrange Multiplier State-Space
Substructuring (LM-SSS) is presented and extended to directly compute coupled
displacement and velocity state-space models. The LM-SSS method is applied to
couple and decouple state-space models established in the modal domain.
Moreover, it is used together with tailored postprocessing procedures to
eliminate the redundant states originated from the coupling and decoupling
operations. This specific formulation of the LM-SSS approach made it possible
to develop a tailored coupling form, named Unconstrained Coupling Form (UCF).
UCF just requires the computation of a nullspace and does not rely on the
selection of a subspace from a nullspace. By exploiting a numerical example,
LM-SSS was compared with the Lagrange Multiplier Frequency Based Substructuring
(LMFBS) approach, which is currently widely recognized as a reference approach.
This was done both in terms of: a)coupled FRFs derived by coupling the
state-space models of two substructures and b) decoupled FRFs derived by
decoupling the state-space model of a component from the coupled model. LM-SSS
showed to be suitable to compute minimal order coupled models and UCF turned
out to have similar performance as other coupling forms already presented to
the scientific community. As for the decoupling task, the FRFs derived from the
LM-SSS approach perfectly matched those obtained by LM-FBS. Moreover, it was
also demonstrated that the elimination of the redundant states originated from
the decoupling operation was correctly performed. The approaches discussed were
exploited on an experimental substructuring application. LM-SSS resulted to be
a reliable SSS technique to perform coupling and decoupling operations with
state-space models estimated from measured FRFs as well as to provide accurate
minimal-order models.

  nanocavities for efficient circularly polarised emission",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Chiral excited electronic states of molecules have an intrinsic sense of
handedness, or twist, and are the active component in energy efficient display
technologies and in new photosynthetic routes to produce pharmaceuticals.
Creating chiral states is achieved by manipulating the twistiness of the
geometric molecular structure. This is a demanding problem adding complexity
due to the need to precisely control molecular geometry. Here we demonstrate a
novel concept for creating chiral excited states which does not rely on
molecular structure. Instead, it depends on hybridising a non chiral molecule
with a chiral electromagnetic field, producing a hybrid light matter chiral
polariton state. This is achieved by a symmetry controlled strong chiral-light
matter interaction between an electromagnetic mode of a chiral nanocavity and
an achiral molecule, a concept referred to as the electromagnetic enantiomer.
This electromagnetic mechanism simplifies the creation of chiral electronic
states since it is far less demanding in terms of materials design. We have
illustrated the concept using an exemplar system relevant to organic
optoelectronic technology, producing efficient circularly polarised emission
from a non-chiral emitter molecule.

  image deblurring and super-resolution",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bilevel learning is a powerful optimization technique that has extensively
been employed in recent years to bridge the world of model-driven variational
approaches with data-driven methods. Upon suitable parametrization of the
desired quantities of interest (e.g., regularization terms or discretization
filters), such approach computes optimal parameter values by solving a nested
optimization problem where the variational model acts as a constraint. In this
work, we consider two different use cases of bilevel learning for the problem
of image restoration. First, we focus on learning scalar weights and
convolutional filters defining a Field of Experts regularizer to restore
natural images degraded by blur and noise. For improving the practical
performance, the lower-level problem is solved by means of a gradient descent
scheme combined with a line-search strategy based on the Barzilai-Borwein rule.
As a second application, the bilevel setup is employed for learning a
discretization of the popular total variation regularizer for solving image
restoration problems (in particular, deblurring and super-resolution).
Numerical results show the effectiveness of the approach and their
generalization to multiple tasks.

remain without clear answers: what are their sources, how are they accelerated,
how do they propagate? Gamma-ray astronomy plays a fundamental role in this
field. Both relativistic protons and electrons can emit in the gamma-ray band
through different processes, but only the detection of hadronic gamma-ray
emission can probe the acceleration of cosmic rays. In particular, due to the
Klein-Nishina suppression of inverse Compton emission at the highest energies,
the detection of gamma-ray emission above 100 TeV was expected to provide firm
proof of the acceleration of PeV hadrons. However, the recent results published
by the LHAASO collaboration revealed the existence of several PeV sources
likely related to PWNe, well known leptonic factories (e.g. the Crab Nebula for
all). As a consequence, a gamma-ray detection at PeV energies may no longer be
the final proof of hadronic acceleration. However, the limited angular
resolution of LHAASO makes associations uncertain and more detailed and deeper
studies are needed. In this context, the ASTRI Mini-Array, with its
unprecedented sensitivity and angular resolution at E>10 TeV, not only can
extend the gamma-ray spectra of candidate Cosmic Ray factories but could help
to distinguish emission regions from PWNe and other LHAASO sources, shedding
light on the nature of the highest energy emission.

prediction of water depth rasters at high spatial resolution. Efficient,
accurate, and fast methods for water depth prediction are nowadays important as
urban floods are increasing due to higher rainfall intensity caused by climate
change, expansion of cities and changes in land use. While hydrodynamic models
models can provide reliable forecasts by simulating water depth at every
location of a catchment, they also have a high computational burden which
jeopardizes their application to real-time prediction in large urban areas at
high spatial resolution. Here, we propose to address this issue by using
data-driven techniques. Specifically, we evaluate deep learning models which
are trained to reproduce the data simulated by the CADDIES cellular-automata
flood model, providing flood forecasts that can occur at different future time
horizons. The advantage of using such models is that they can learn the
underlying physical phenomena a priori, preventing manual parameter setting and
computational burden. We perform experiments on a dataset consisting of two
catchments areas within Switzerland with 18 simpler, short rainfall patterns
and 4 long, more complex ones. Our results show that the deep learning models
present in general lower errors compared to the other methods, especially for
water depths $>0.5m$. However, when testing on more complex rainfall events or
unseen catchment areas, the deep models do not show benefits over the simpler
ones.

developed to self-assemble bridges to span gaps and self-disassemble them.
Self-disassembly of bridges may increase the transport efficiency of swarm
robots by increasing the number of moving robots, and also may decrease the
efficiency by causing gaps to reappear. Our aim is to elucidate the influence
of self-disassembly of bridges on the collective flow characteristics of swarm
robots in a single-lane and periodic system with a gap. In the system, robots
span and cross the gap by self-assembling a single-layer bridge. We consider
two scenarios in which self-disassembling bridges is prevented
(prevent-scenario) or allowed (allow-scenario). We represent the horizontal
movement of robots with a typical car-following model, and simply model the
actions of robots for self-assembling and self-disassembling bridges. Numerical
simulations have revealed the following results. Flow-density diagrams in both
the scenarios shift to the higher-density region as the gap length increases.
When density is low, allow-scenario exhibits the steady state of repeated
self-assembly and self-disassembly of bridges. If density is extremely low,
flow in this state is greater than flow in prevent-scenario owing to the
increase in the number of robots moving horizontally. Otherwise, flow in this
state is smaller than flow in prevent-scenario. Besides, flow in this state
increases monotonically with respect to the velocity of robots in joining and
leaving bridges. Thus, self-disassembling bridges is recommended for only
extremely low-density conditions in periodic systems. This study contributes to
the development of the collective dynamics of self-driven particles that
self-assemble structures, and stirs the dynamics with other self-assembled
structures, such as ramps, chains, and towers.

origin. Their burst signal is dispersed by the free electrons in the
large-scale-structure (LSS), leading to delayed arrival times at different
frequencies. Another potential source of time delay is the well known Shapiro
delay, which measures the space-space and time-time metric perturbations along
the line-of-sight. If photons of different frequencies follow different
trajectories, i.e. if the universality of free fall guaranteed by the weak
equivalence principle (WEP) is violated, they would experience an additional
relative delay. This quantity, however, is not an observable on the background
level as it is not gauge independent, which has led to confusion in previous
papers. Instead, an imprint can be seen in the correlation between the time
delays of different pulses. In this paper, we derive robust and consistent
constraints from twelve localised FRBs on the violation of the WEP in the
energy range between 4.6 and 6 meV. In contrast to a number of previous
studies, we consider our signal to be not in the model, but in the covariance
matrix of the likelihood. To do so, we calculate the covariance of the time
delays induced by the free electrons in the LSS, the WEP breaking terms, the
Milky Way and host galaxy. By marginalising over both host galaxy contribution
and the contribution from the free electrons, we find that the parametrised
post-Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ characterising the WEP violation must be
constant in this energy range to 1 in $10^{13}$ at 68$\;\%$ confidence. These
are the tightest constraints to-date on $\Delta\gamma$ in this low energy
range.

  Inquiry: It can be hard to program MPCs correctly and efficiently using
existing languages and frameworks, especially when they require coordinating
disparate computational roles. How can we make this easier?
  Approach: We present Symphony, a new functional programming language for MPCs
among two or more parties. Symphony starts from the single-instruction,
multiple-data (SIMD) semantics of prior MPC languages, in which each party
carries out symmetric responsibilities, and generalizes it using constructs
that can coordinate many parties. Symphony introduces **first-class shares**
and **first-class party sets** to provide unmatched language-level expressive
power with high efficiency.
  Knowledge: Developing a core formal language called $\lambda$-Symphony, we
prove that the intuitive, generalized SIMD view of a program coincides with its
actual distributed semantics. Thus the programmer can reason about her programs
by reading them from top to bottom, even though in reality the program runs in
a coordinated fashion, distributed across many machines. We implemented a
prototype interpreter for Symphony leveraging multiple cryptographic backends.
With it we wrote a variety of MPC programs, finding that Symphony can express
optimized protocols that other languages cannot, and that in general Symphony
programs operate efficiently.

based on the proximal sampler introduced in~\citet{lee2021structured}. The
performance of this proximal sampler is determined by that of the restricted

concentration inequality for semi-smooth functions over Gaussian distributions,
extending the well-known concentration inequality for Lipschitz functions.
Applying our RGO implementation to the proximal sampler, we achieve
state-of-the-art complexity bounds in almost all settings. For instance, for
strongly log-concave distributions, our method has complexity bound
$\tilde\mathcal{O}(\kappa d^{1/2})$ without warm start, better than the minimax

deep learning based methods have proven effective on some benchmark datasets,
such as KITTI and Scene Flow. UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) are commonly
utilized for surface observation, and their captured images are frequently used
for detailed 3D reconstruction due to high resolution and low-altitude

significant amount of training data with ground-truth labels to learn model
parameters. However, due to the scarcity of UAV stereo matching datasets, the
learning-based network cannot be applied to UAV images. To facilitate further
research, this paper proposes a novel pipeline to generate accurate and dense
disparity maps using detailed meshes reconstructed by UAV images and LiDAR
point clouds. Through the proposed pipeline, this paper constructs a
multi-resolution UAV scenario dataset, called UAVStereo, with over 34k stereo
image pairs covering 3 typical scenes. As far as we know, UAVStereo is the
first stereo matching dataset of UAV low-altitude scenarios. The dataset
includes synthetic and real stereo pairs to enable generalization from the
synthetic domain to the real domain. Furthermore, our UAVStereo dataset
provides multi-resolution and multi-scene images pairs to accommodate a variety
of sensors and environments. In this paper, we evaluate traditional and

also suggests a large minimum grain size requiring either very porous grains or
a suppression of small grain production, and a radially stratified particle

($s^{-3.8}$ where $s$ is the grain size) weighted towards smaller grains and
the outer disk prefers a shallower slope ($s^{-3.4}$) with a minimum particle

  In the previous setting, we prove that the following conditions are
equivalent: the space has linear volume growth; it is Gromov--Hausdorff
asymptotic to one cylinder at infinity; it has uniformly bounded isoperimetric
profile; the entire space is a tubular neighborhood of either a line or a ray.
Moreover, on a space satisfying any of the previous conditions, we prove

Hubble Space Telescope's observation of galaxies at redshifts z > 10, appears
to have been exacerbated by the more recent James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)
discovery of galaxy candidates at even higher redshifts (z ~ 17) which,
however, are yet to be confirmed spectroscopically. These candidates would have
emerged only ~ 230 million years after the big bang in the context of LCDM,
requiring a more rapid star formation in the earliest galaxies than appears to
be permitted by simulations adopting the concordance model parameters. This
time-compression problem would therefore be inconsistent with the age-redshift
relation predicted by LCDM. Instead, the sequence of star formation and galaxy
assembly would confirm the timeline predicted by the R_h=ct universe, a
theoretically advanced version of LCDM that incorporates the `zero active mass'
condition from general relativity. This model has accounted for many
cosmological data better than LCDM, and eliminates all of its inconsistencies,
including the horizon and initial entropy problems. The latest JWST discoveries
at z > 14, if confirmed, would add further support to the idea that the R_h=ct
universe is favored by the observations over the current standard model.

  Quality Dynamics",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tracing disinfectant (e.g., chlorine) and contaminants evolution in water
networks requires the solution of 1- D advection-reaction (AR) partial
differential equations (PDEs). With the absence of analytical solutions in many
scenarios, numerical solutions require high-resolution time- and
spacediscretizations resulting in large model dimensions. This adds complexity
to the water quality control problem. In addition, considering multi-species
water quality dynamics rather than the single-species dynamics produces a more
accurate description of the reaction dynamics under abnormal hazardous
conditions (e.g., contamination events). Yet, these dynamics introduces
nonlinear reaction formulation to the model. To that end, solving nonlinear 1-D
AR PDEs in real time is critical in achieving monitoring and control goals for
various scaled networks with a high computational burden. In this work, we
propose a novel comprehensive framework to overcome the large-dimensionality
issue by introducing different approaches for applying model order reduction
(MOR) algorithms to the nonlinear system followed by applying real-time water
quality regulation algorithm that is based on an advanced model to maintain
desirable disinfectant levels in water networks under multi-species dynamics.
The performance of this framework is validated using rigorous numerical case
studies under a wide range of scenarios demonstrating the challenges associated
with regulating water quality under such conditions.

account for solution-dependent inhomogeneous Robin boundary conditions which
can render the associated initial-boundary problem to be nonlinear. The
strength of the inhomogeneity is controlled by an intensity factor of order
${\mathcal{O}} (\varepsilon^\alpha)$, $\alpha >0$.
  The asymptotic behaviour of the solution is studied as $\varepsilon \to 0,$
i.e., when the diffusion coefficients are eliminated and the thin
three-diemnsional network is shrunk into a graph. There are three qualitatively
different cases in the asymptotic behaviour of the solution depending on the
value of the intensity parameter $\alpha:$ $\alpha =1,$ $\alpha > 1,$ and
$\alpha \in (0, 1).$ We construct the asymptotic approximation of the solution,
which provides us with the hyperbolic limit model for $\varepsilon \to 0$ for
the first two cases, and prove the corresponding uniform pointwise estimates

ensemble feature selectors like the Repeated Elastic Net Technique for Feature

expert knowledge a priori in the feature selection process. In this work we
compare both feature selectors on a dataset comprising of 63 patients and 134
features from multiple sources, including basic patient characteristics,
baseline blood values, tumor histology, imaging, and treatment information. Our
experiments involve data-driven and expert-driven setups, as well as

accurate predictions, and that expert knowledge has a stabilizing effect on the

the three FRBs in single coherent tied-array beams and localised them to an
area of ~1 arcmin$^2$. We investigate their burst properties, scattering,
repetition rates, and localisations in a multi-wavelength context. FRB
20201211A shows hints of scatter broadening but is otherwise consistent with
instrumental dispersion smearing. For FRB 20210202D, we discovered a faint
post-cursor burst separated by ~200 ms, suggesting a distinct burst component
or a repeat pulse. We attempt to associate the FRBs with host galaxy
candidates. For FRB 20210408H, we tentatively (0.35 - 0.53 probability)
identify a compatible host at a redshift ~0.5. Additionally, we analyse the
MeerTRAP survey properties, such as the survey coverage, fluence completeness,
and their implications for the FRB population. Based on the entire sample of 11
MeerTRAP FRBs discovered by the end of 2021, we estimate the FRB all-sky rates
and their scaling with the fluence threshold. The inferred FRB all-sky rates at
1.28 GHz are $4.4_{-2.5}^{+4.3}$ and $2.1_{-1.1}^{+1.8} \times 10^3$ sky$^{-1}$
d$^{-1}$ above 0.66 and 3.44 Jy ms for the coherent and incoherent surveys,

fluences at the 95 per cent confidence level. There seems to be a deficit of
low-fluence FRBs, suggesting a break or turn-over in the rate versus fluence

origins. The cumulative source counts within our surveys appear consistent with
the Euclidean scaling.

temporal graph consists of a finite sequence of snapshot graphs
$\mathcal{G}=(G_1, G_2, \dots, G_L)$ that share a common vertex set but might
have different edge sets.
  The non-strict temporal exploration problem (NS-TEXP for short) introduced by
Erlebach and Spooner, asks if a single agent can visit all vertices of a given
temporal graph where the edges traversed by the agent are present in non-strict
monotonous time steps, i.e., the agent can move along the edges of a snapshot
graph with infinite speed. The exploration must at the latest be completed in
the last snapshot graph. The optimization variant of this problem is the
$k$-arb NS-TEXP problem, where the agent's task is to visit at least $k$
vertices of the temporal graph. We show that under standard computational
complexity assumptions, neither of the problems NS-TEXP nor $k$-arb NS-TEXP
allow for polynomial kernels in the standard parameters: number of vertices
$n$, lifetime $L$, number of vertices to visit $k$, and maximal number of
connected components per time step $\gamma$; as well as in the combined
parameters $L+k$, $L + \gamma$, and $k+\gamma$. On the way to establishing
these lower bounds, we answer a couple of questions left open by Erlebach and
Spooner.
  We also initiate the study of structural kernelization by identifying a new
parameter of a temporal graph
  $p(\mathcal{G}) = \sum_{i=1}^{L} (|E(G_i)|) - |V(G)| +1$. Informally, this
parameter measures how dynamic the temporal graph is. Our main algorithmic
result is the construction of a polynomial (in $p(\mathcal{G})$) kernel for the
more general Weighted $k$-arb NS-TEXP problem, where weights are assigned to
the vertices and the task is to find a temporal walk of weight at least $k$.

asteroids, comets) have surfaces made of intimate mixtures of opaque minerals
and other components (silicates, carbonaceous compounds, etc.) in the form of
sub-micrometre-sized grains, smaller than the wavelength at which they are
observed, so-called hyperfine grains. Here, we investigate how the Vis-NIR-MIR
spectral and V-band polarimetric properties of surfaces made of hyperfine
grains are influenced by the relative abundance of such hyperfine materials,
having strongly different optical indexes. Mixtures of grains of olivine and
iron sulfide (or anthracite), as analogues of silicates and opaque minerals
present on small bodies, were prepared at different proportions. The
measurements reveal that these mixtures of hyperfine grains have spectral and
polarimetric Vis-NIR properties varying in strongly nonlinear ways. When
present at even a few percent, opaque components dominate the Vis-NIR spectral
and polarimetric properties, and mask the silicate bands at these wavelengths.
The Vis-NIR spectral slope ranges from red (positive slope), for pure opaque
material, to blue (negative slope) as the proportion of silicates increases,
which is reminiscent of the range of spectral slopes observed on P, D, X, C-
and B-types asteroids. The spectra of the darkest mixtures in the Vis-NIR
exhibit the absorption bands of Si-O in olivine around 10 m in the MIR, which
is observed in emission for several small bodies. This work shows that both the
contrasted optical indexes of the components, and the dispersion or aggregation
(depending on their relative proportions) of their hyperfine grains, induce
different light scattering regimes in the Vis-NIR and MIR, as observed for
primitive small bodies. The optical separation of hyperfine grains seems to be
a major parameter controlling the optical properties of these objects.

microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations, we show that viscoelastic
instability in flow through a hexagonally ordered (staggered) medium strongly
enhances dispersion transverse to the mean flow direction with increasing
Weissenberg number (Wi). In contrast, preferential flow paths can quench the
elastic instability in disordered media, which has two important consequences
for transport: First, the lack of chaotic velocity fluctuations reduces
transverse dispersion relative to unstable flows. Second, the amplification of
flow along preferential paths with increasing Wi causes strongly-correlated
stream-wise flow that enhances longitudinal dispersion. Finally, we illustrate
how the observed dispersion phenomena can be understood through the lens of
Lagrangian stretching manifolds, which act as advective transport barriers and
coincide with high stress regions in these viscoelastic porous media flows.

critical properties of the quantum phase transition between Dirac semi-metal

Bernstein inequality, that we prove in this note, says that the reverse
inequality holds for functions in the orthogonal complement of the space of
polynomials of fixed degree. In fact, we derived a more general result for the
lower bounds on higher derivatives. These bounds are better then those obtained

model (BCSM) is analyzed. From the consistency condition of the constraints
obtained from the Dirac method, we can observe that this model presents, for
certain values of the $\alpha$ parameter, two second-class constraints, which
means that this system does not possess gauge invariance. However, we know that
it is possible to disclose gauge symmetries in such a system by converting the
original second-class system into a first-class one. This procedure can be done
through the gauge unfixing (GU) formalism by acting with a projection operator
directly on the original second-class Hamiltonian, without adding any extra
degrees of freedom in the phase space. One of the constraints becomes the gauge
symmetry generator of the theory and the other one is disregarded. At the end,
we have a first-class Hamiltonian satisfying a first-class algebra. Here, our
goal is to apply a new scheme of embedding second-class constrained systems
based on the GU formalism, named improved GU formalism, in the BCSM. The
original second-class variables are directly converted into gauge invariant
variables, called GU variables. We have verified that the Poisson brackets
involving the GU variables are equal to the Dirac brackets between the original
second-class variables. Finally, we have found that our improved GU variables
coincide with those obtained from an improved BFT method after a particular
choice for the Wess-Zumino terms.

assess the role of radiation pressure in thousands of sub-regions across two
local star-forming galaxies, NGC 6946 and NGC 5194. Using a model for the
spectral energy distribution from stellar population synthesis and realistic
dust grain scattering and absorption, we compute flux- and radiation
pressure-mean opacities and population-averaged optical depth $\langle\tau_{\rm

through a dusty column to the stellar continuum. Optically-thin regions around
young stellar populations are $30-50$ times super-Eddington. We calculate the
Eddington ratio for the sub-regions including the local mass of young and old
stars and HI and molecular gas. We compute the fraction of the total star
formation that is currently super-Eddington, and provide an assessment of the
role of radiation pressure in the dusty gas dynamics. Depending on the assumed
height of the dusty gas and the age of the stellar population, we find that
$\sim0-10$% of the sightlines are super-Eddington. These regions may be
accelerated to $\sim5-15$ km/s by radiation pressure alone. Additionally, our
results show that for beamed radiation the function $1-\exp(-\langle\tau_{\rm

current proof assistants provide poor support for capturing these narrative
notes formally, an observation that is especially true of systems based on
Gordon's HOL, a classical higher-order logic. Consequently, HOL and its many
implementations seem ironically more committed to classical reasoning than
mainstream mathematicians are themselves, limiting the mathematical content
that one may easily formalise. To facilitate these context switches, we propose
that mathematicians mentally employ a simple tainting system when temporarily

  Representations (ICLR)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Policy Gradient (PG) algorithms employ value networks to drive the
learning of parameterized policies and reduce the variance of the gradient

struggles to fit the actual return, limiting the variance reduction efficacy
and leading policies to sub-optimal performance. This paper focuses on
improving value approximation and analyzing the effects on Deep PG primitives
such as value prediction, variance reduction, and correlation of gradient
estimates with the true gradient. To this end, we introduce a Value Function
Search that employs a population of perturbed value networks to search for a
better approximation. Our framework does not require additional environment
interactions, gradient computations, or ensembles, providing a computationally
inexpensive approach to enhance the supervised learning task on which value
networks train. Crucially, we show that improving Deep PG primitives results in
improved sample efficiency and policies with higher returns using common

history of financial crises reveals significant weaknesses and vulnerabilities
in the foundations of modern economies. Another significant issue currently is
people quitting their jobs in large numbers. Moreover, many organizations have
a diverse workforce comprising multiple generations posing new challenges.
Transformative approaches in economics and labour markets are needed to protect
our societies, economies, and planet. In this work, we use big data and machine
learning methods to discover multi-perspective parameters for
multi-generational labour markets. The parameters for the academic perspective
are discovered using 35,000 article abstracts from the Web of Science for the
period 1958-2022 and for the professionals' perspective using 57,000 LinkedIn
posts from 2022. We discover a total of 28 parameters and categorised them into
5 macro-parameters, Learning & Skills, Employment Sectors, Consumer Industries,
Learning & Employment Issues, and Generations-specific Issues. A complete
machine learning software tool is developed for data-driven parameter
discovery. A variety of quantitative and visualisation methods are applied and
multiple taxonomies are extracted to explore multi-generational labour markets.
A knowledge structure and literature review of multi-generational labour
markets using over 100 research articles is provided. It is expected that this
work will enhance the theory and practice of AI-based methods for knowledge
discovery and system parameter discovery to develop autonomous capabilities and
systems and promote novel approaches to labour economics and markets, leading
to the development of sustainable societies and economies.

criterion which minimizes the distance between the candidate steering vectors
and the filtered snapshots in the T-F domain. Our method requires no
eigendecomposition and uses a simple normalization to prevent the optimization
objective from being misled by noisy filtered snapshots. We also study
different designs of T-F weights guided by a DNN. We find that duplicating the
Hadamard product of speech ratio masks is highly effective and better than
other techniques such as direct masking and taking the mean in the proposed
approach. However, the best-performing design of T-F weights is
criterion-dependent in general. Experiments show that the proposed method
outperforms popular DNN based DoA estimation methods including widely used
subspace methods in noisy and reverberant environments.

which we term quantum dueling. In previous algorithms, potential solutions to
the given optimization problems were encoded as basis states of the Hilbert
space. Quantum dueling, however, doubles the number of qubits used, making the
basis states represent a pair of potential solutions in the augmented Hilbert
space. Under this representation, we realize that if we can construct quantum
oracles that identify one element of such pair over the other based on the
objective function, quantum optimization can be achieved by quantum amplitude
amplification. An additional set of parameters are required to compensate for
reachability issues. We extensively use classical simulation evidence to test
our designs. For intuitively chosen parameters, quantum dueling performs well,
though reachability is highly dependent on solution distribution. In this case,
the evolution of the success probability is highly regular. Thus, there might
be ways to approximate the state evolution mathematically. For optimal
parameters, data suggest that quantum dueling requires $O(\sqrt{N})$ accesses
to the gates to reach a constant-level success probability threshold and
performs well for almost all solution distributions. In addition to potential
constant-level optimization compared with the fastest algorithms, quantum
dueling can also be used as a subroutine for higher-level quantum algorithms.
Moreover, quantum dueling shares similarities with many variational
optimization algorithms, most notably QAOA. This suggests that the strategy of
quantum dueling might be transplanted into a Hamiltonian setup. In that case,
we might obtain viable optimization algorithms for near-term quantum computing,
with the added advantage of easier training.

characters are rare but interesting objects with several applications to finite
geometry and coding theory. Since almost all known examples are large, the
construction of small ones, with $k$ close to the order of the plane, is
considered a hard problem. A natural candidate to be a small $(k,n)$-arc with
few characters is the set $\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ of the points of a plane curve
$\mathcal{C}$ of degree $n$ (containing no linear components) such that some
line meets $\mathcal{C}$ transversally in the plane, i.e. in $n$ pairwise
distinct points. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be either the Hermitian curve of degree
$q+1$ in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q^{2r})$ with $r\ge 1$, or the rational BKS curve of
degree $q+1$ in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q^r)$ with $q$ odd and $r\ge 1$. Then
$\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ has four and seven characters, respectively. Furthermore,
$\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ is small as both curves are either maximal or minimal.
The completeness problem is investigated by an algebraic approach based on
Galois theory and on the Hasse-Weil lower bound. Our main result for the
Hermitian case is that $\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ is complete for $r\ge 4$. For the
rational BKS curve, $\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ is complete if and only if $r$ is
even. If $r$ is odd then the uncovered points by the $(q+1)$-secants to
$\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ are exactly the points in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ not lying in
$\Omega(\mathcal{C})$. Adding those points to $\Omega(\mathcal{C})$ produces a
complete $(k,q+1)$-arc in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q^r)$, with $k=q^r+q$. The above
results do not hold true for $r=2$ and there remain open the case $r=3$ for the
Hermitian curve, and the cases $r=3,4$ for the rational BKS curve. As a by
product we also obtain two results of interest in the study of the Galois
inverse problem for $\mathrm{PGL}(2,q)$.

to timelines of both the past and the future. Spiking across populations of
neurons in many regions of the mammalian brain maintains a robust temporal
memory, a neural timeline of the recent past. Behavioral results demonstrate
that people can estimate an extended temporal model of the future, suggesting
that the neural timeline of the past could extend through the present into the
future. This paper presents a mathematical framework for learning and
expressing relationships between events in continuous time. We assume that the
brain has access to a temporal memory in the form of the real Laplace transform
of the recent past. Hebbian associations with a diversity of synaptic time
scales are formed between the past and the present that record the temporal
relationships between events. Knowing the temporal relationships between the
past and the present allows one to predict relationships between the present
and the future, thus constructing an extended temporal prediction for the
future. Both memory for the past and the predicted future are represented as
the real Laplace transform, expressed as the firing rate over populations of
neurons indexed by different rate constants $s$. The diversity of synaptic
timescales allows for a temporal record over the much larger time scale of
trial history. In this framework, temporal credit assignment can be assessed
via a Laplace temporal difference. The Laplace temporal difference compares the
future that actually follows a stimulus to the future predicted just before the
stimulus was observed. This computational framework makes a number of specific
neurophysiological predictions and, taken together, could provide the basis for
a future iteration of RL that incorporates temporal memory as a fundamental
building block.

novel task of test completion to automatically complete the next statement in a
test method based on the context of prior statements and the code under test.
We develop TeCo -- a deep learning model using code semantics for test
completion. The key insight underlying TeCo is that predicting the next
statement in a test method requires reasoning about code execution, which is
hard to do with only syntax-level data that existing code completion models
use. TeCo extracts and uses six kinds of code semantics data, including the
execution result of prior statements and the execution context of the test
method. To provide a testbed for this new task, as well as to evaluate TeCo, we
collect a corpus of 130,934 test methods from 1,270 open-source Java projects.
Our results show that TeCo achieves an exact-match accuracy of 18, which is 29%
higher than the best baseline using syntax-level data only. When measuring
functional correctness of generated next statement, TeCo can generate runnable
code in 29% of the cases compared to 18% obtained by the best baseline.
Moreover, TeCo is significantly better than prior work on test oracle
generation.

periodic magnetic field manifests as a periodic CF potential and transforms the
CF Fermi surface into gapless Fermi points. We further show that by breaking
the particle-hole symmetry of the TI surface -- either by doping or by
introducing a periodic electrostatic potential with zero mean -- our quantum
critical phase gives way to a sequence of fractional Chern insulator phases.
Our theory illustrates the rich menagerie of quantum phases possible around

Community prototypes are then constructed for specific communities by measuring

Building upon this discovery, we propose to perform real-vs-fake classification
without learning; i.e., using a feature space not explicitly trained to
distinguish real from fake images. We use nearest neighbor and linear probing
as instantiations of this idea. When given access to the feature space of a
large pretrained vision-language model, the very simple baseline of nearest

study. Due to the presence of van Hove singularities, electron-electron
interaction has been suggested to play an important role in the formation of
such broken symmetry states. Recent experiments show that the CDW order is
three-dimensional and it is staggered across different kagome layers. However,
the experimental interpretation for the precise structure of CDW varies in
terms of whether it is the star of David (SD), inverse star of David (ISD) or
the alternation of the two among neighboring layers. In this work, we show that
the origin of these distinct CDW orders can be understood in a unified picture
by considering intra- and inter-layer electron-electron interactions as well as
the coupling between electrons and lattice distortions. Utilizing an effective
9-band model with V $d$ orbitals and out-of-plane Sb $p$ orbitals, it is
demonstrated that the repulsive electron-electron interaction favors charge
bond order which induces either SD or ISD upon including lattice distortions.
As the inter-layer interaction is introduced, $\pi$-shifted CDW develops with
the staggered ordering along the $c$-axis. We also find that the phase with
alternating SD and ISD can be stabilized as the ground state under strong
inter-layer interaction.

Sigma_SFR and infer electron densities, n_e, using the ratio of the [OII] 3727,

smaller sample of 25 individual galaxies with inferences of U. The increase in
n_e -- and possibly also the volume filling factor of dense clumps in HII

relationship between U and Sigma_SFR. Further, the increase in n_e and SFR with
redshift at a fixed stellar mass can account for most of the redshift evolution

in terms of the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classification. In HYMORS, one radio lobe
appears edge-darkened (FR I), while the other shows a well-defined emission
peak near its outer edge (edge-brightened, FR II). Such sources are rare but
critical for constraining the mechanism responsible for the FR dichotomy, a
widely debated issue in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we highlight the need
for caution in assigning FR type, in view of some upcoming observational
campaigns to confirm HYMORS among the candidates. To illustrate this we
highlight the cases of 3 radio sources which have been perceived to be HYMORS,
including the radio galaxy 0500+630 (4C +63.07) which has been claimed to be a
good, original example of a HYMORS, with a FR I western lobe and a FR II
eastern lobe marked by a prominent terminal hot spot. However, its recent VLASS
map at 3 GHz has revealed that the western lobe actually extends much farther
out than reported and terminates in a well-defined emission peak. This implies
that the source is a regular FR II radio galaxy and not a HYMORS. We also
provide a brief perspective of the HYMORS phenomenon and underscore the need to
confirm a FR I classification by ruling out additional FR II characteristics,

JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO. We identified
potential members of the overdensity using HST+JWST photometry spanning
$\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$. These data provide accurate and
well-constrained photometric redshifts down to $m \approx 29-30\,\mathrm{mag}$.
We subsequently confirmed $N = 96$ potential members of the overdensity using
JWST slitless spectroscopy over $\lambda = 3.9-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ through a
targeted line search for $\mathrm{H} \alpha$ around the best-fit photometric
redshift. We verified that $N = 53$ galaxies reside in the field at $z =
5.2-5.5$ while $N = 43$ galaxies reside in an overdensity at $z = 5.4$ around
$\sim 10-12$ times that of a random volume. Stellar populations for these
galaxies were inferred from the photometry and used to construct the
star-forming main sequence, where protocluster members appeared more massive
and exhibited earlier star formation (and thus older stellar populations) when
compared to their field galaxy counterparts. We estimate the total halo mass of
this large-scale structure to be $13.0 \lesssim \mathrm{log}_{10} \left(
M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot} \right) \lesssim 13.5$ using an empirical stellar
mass to halo mass relation, although this is likely an underestimate as a
result of incompleteness. Our discovery demonstrates the power of JWST at
constraining dark matter halo assembly and galaxy formation at very early
cosmic times.

that several well-known Gaussian wavepacket dynamics methods, such as Heller's

Gaussian approximation, fit into this framework if the effective potential is a
quadratic polynomial with state-dependent coefficients. We study such a
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation in general: in particular, we derive general

reversibility and norm conservation, and analyze conservation of the energy,
effective energy, and symplectic structure. We also describe efficient
geometric integrators of arbitrary even orders of accuracy in the time step for
the numerical solution of this nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. The general

dynamics, including the variational and nonvariational thawed and frozen

global harmonic, local harmonic, single-Hessian, local cubic, and single
quartic approximations for the potential energy. Without substantially
increasing the cost, the proposed single quartic variational thawed Gaussian
wavepacket dynamics improves the accuracy over the local cubic approximation

pressure exceeds the thermal pressure. To quantify these deviations, we present
a systematic study of the dynamical properties of magnetically arrested discs
(MADs), the most magnetized type of accretion disc. Using an artificial cooling
function to regulate the gas temperature, we study MADs of three different
thermal thicknesses, $h_\mathrm{th}/r=0.3, 0.1$ and $0.03$. We find that the
radial structure of the disc is never mostly supported by the magnetic field.
In fact, thin MADs are very near Keplerian. However, as discs gets colder, they
become more magnetized and the largest deviations from standard theory appear
in our thinnest disc with $h_\mathrm{th}/r=0.03$. In this case, the disc is
much more extended vertically and much less dense than in standard theory
because of vertical support from the turbulent magnetic pressure and
wind-driven angular momentum transport that enhances the inflow speed. The thin
disc also dissipates a lot of thermal energy outside of $z/r = \pm 0.03$ and a
significant fraction of this dissipation happens in mildly relativistic winds.
The enhanced dissipation in low-density regions could possibly feed coronae in
X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Wind-driven accretion
will also impact the dynamical evolution of accretion discs and could provide a
mechanism to explain the rapid evolution of changing-look AGN and the secular
evolution of XRBs. Finally, our MAD winds have terminal velocities and mass
loss rates in good agreement with the properties of ultra-fast outflows
observed in AGN.

address this problem, we propose a novel approach to MIRL via Theory of Mind

distribution over baseline reward profiles given their demonstrated behavior.
We then perform MIRL via decentralized equilibrium by employing single-agent
Maximum Entropy IRL to infer a reward function for each agent, where we
simulate the behavior of other teammates according to the time-varying
distribution over profiles. We evaluate our approach in a simulated 2-player

roles, is to search for and evacuate victims in the environment. Our results
show that the choice of baseline profiles is paramount to the recovery of the

algorithms for a given application model, discretizations and even regimes of

develop fully algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods for almost 40 years. Classic
geometric multigrid (GMG) has been effectively applied to challenging,
non-elliptic problems in engineering and scientifically relevant codes, but
application specific algorithms are generally required that do not lend
themselves to deployment in numerical libraries. However, tools in libraries
that support discretizations, distributed mesh management and high performance
computing (HPC) can be used to develop such solvers.
  This report develops a magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code in PETSc (Portable
Extensible Toolkit for Scientific computing) with a fully integrated GMG solver
that is designed to demonstrate the potential of our approach to providing fast
and robust solvers for production applications. These applications must,
however, be able to provide, in addition to the Jacobian matrix and residual of
a pure AMG solver, a hierarchy of meshes and knowledge of the application's
equations and discretization. An example of a 2D, two field reduced resistive
MHD model, using existing tools in PETSc that is verified with a ``tilt""
instability problem that is well documented in the literature is presented and
is an example in the PETSc repository (\path{src/ts/tutorials/ex48.c}).
Preliminary CPU-only performance data demonstrates that the solver can be
robust and scalable for the model problem that is pushed into a regime with
highly localized current sheets, which generates strong, localized
non-linearity, that is a challenge for iterative solvers.

log-smooth distribution $\pi$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ to high accuracy is a
fundamental problem, both from a practical and theoretical standpoint. In
practice, high-accuracy samplers such as the classical Metropolis-adjusted
Langevin algorithm (MALA) remain the de facto gold standard; and in theory, via
the proximal sampler reduction, it is understood that such samplers are key for
sampling even beyond log-concavity (in particular, for distributions satisfying
isoperimetric assumptions).
  In this work, we improve the dimension dependence of this sampling problem to
$\tilde{O}(d^{1/2})$, whereas the previous best result for MALA was
$\tilde{O}(d)$. This closes the long line of work on the complexity of MALA,
and moreover leads to state-of-the-art guarantees for high-accuracy sampling
under strong log-concavity and beyond (thanks to the aforementioned reduction).
  Our starting point is that the complexity of MALA improves to
$\tilde{O}(d^{1/2})$, but only under a warm start (an initialization with
constant R\'enyi divergence w.r.t. $\pi$). Previous algorithms took much longer
to find a warm start than to use it, and closing this gap has remained an
important open problem in the field. Our main technical contribution settles
this problem by establishing the first $\tilde{O}(d^{1/2})$ R\'enyi mixing
rates for the discretized underdamped Langevin diffusion. For this, we develop
new differential-privacy-inspired techniques based on R\'enyi divergences with
Orlicz--Wasserstein shifts, which allow us to sidestep longstanding challenges

These algorithms have been combined with other techniques such as the pruning
of Neural Networks, which reduces the complexity of the network, and the
Transfer Learning, which lets the import of knowledge from another problem
related to the one at hand. The usage of several criteria to evaluate the
quality of the evolutionary proposals is also a common case, in which the
performance and complexity of the network are the most used criteria. This work
proposes MO-EvoPruneDeepTL, a multi-objective evolutionary pruning algorithm.
\proposal uses Transfer Learning to adapt the last layers of Deep Neural
Networks, by replacing them with sparse layers evolved by a genetic algorithm,
which guides the evolution based in the performance, complexity and robustness
of the network, being the robustness a great quality indicator for the evolved
models. We carry out different experiments with several datasets to assess the
benefits of our proposal. Results show that our proposal achieves promising
results in all the objectives, and direct relation are presented among them.
The experiments also show that the most influential neurons help us explain
which parts of the input images are the most relevant for the prediction of the
pruned neural network. Lastly, by virtue of the diversity within the Pareto
front of pruning patterns produced by the proposal, it is shown that an
ensemble of differently pruned models improves the overall performance and

information through complex media with high fidelity. However, existing spatial
light modulation devices face a fundamental tradeoff between speed and
accuracy. Digital micromirror devices (DMDs) have emerged as a promising
candidate as accessible high-speed wavefront shaping devices but at the cost of
compromised fidelity, largely due to the physically limited degrees of freedom
and the challenge of numerically optimizing a binary amplitude mask. Here we
introduce a physics-based sparsity-constrained optimization framework that
takes into account the constraints on wavefront shaping and the sparse-to-dense
transformation via complex media to enhance projection fidelity through complex
media. Our method achieves unprecedented high-fidelity light manipulation at
the full speed of DMDs (22 kHz) owing to the pursuit of more feasible, optimal,
and numerically stable inverse solutions. In addition, our method is
system-agnostic and generalizable, demonstrating consistent superior
performance across different types of complex media with up to an 89% increase
in projection accuracy and a 126% improvement in speckle suppression. The
proposed optimization framework has the potential to enhance existing
holographic setups without any change to the hardware, enable high-fidelity and
high-speed wavefront shaping through different scattering media and platforms,
and directly facilitate a wide range of physics and real-world applications.

partial differential equations (PDEs). Recently, there has been a growing
interest in introducing physics constraints into training neural PDE solvers to
reduce the use of costly data and improve the generalization ability. However,
these physics constraints, based on certain finite dimensional approximations
over the function space, must resolve the smallest scaled physics to ensure the
accuracy and stability of the simulation, resulting in high computational costs
from large input, output, and neural networks. This paper proposes a general
acceleration methodology called NeuralStagger by spatially and temporally
decomposing the original learning tasks into several coarser-resolution
subtasks. We define a coarse-resolution neural solver for each subtask, which
requires fewer computational resources, and jointly train them with the vanilla
physics-constrained loss by simply arranging their outputs to reconstruct the
original solution. Due to the perfect parallelism between them, the solution is
achieved as fast as a coarse-resolution neural solver. In addition, the trained
solvers bring the flexibility of simulating with multiple levels of resolution.
We demonstrate the successful application of NeuralStagger on 2D and 3D fluid
dynamics simulations, which leads to an additional $10\sim100\times$ speed-up.
Moreover, the experiment also shows that the learned model could be well used
for optimal control.

transforms the optical signal into electrical form and re-transmits it to the

integrated power beacon within the system. The source-to-relay link (UOWC)
follows a mixture exponential generalized Gamma turbulence with pointing error
impairments whereas all the remaining links (RF) undergo $\kappa-\mu$ shadowed

considered, i.e., colluding (\textit{Scenario-I}) and non-colluding
(\textit{Scenario-II}) eavesdroppers and the analytical expressions of secure
outage probability, probability of strictly positive secrecy capacity, and
effective secrecy throughput are derived in closed form for each scenario.
Furthermore, the impacts of UOWC and RF channel parameters as well as detection
techniques on secrecy capacity are demonstrated, and following this a
comparison between the two considered scenarios is demonstrated that reveals
the collusion between the eavesdroppers imposes the most harmful threat on
secrecy throughput but a better secrecy level can be attained adopting

detection rather than intensity modulation and direct detection technique.

activity affects photochemistry and heating in orbiting planetary atmospheres.
We present a comprehensive analysis of the FUV variability of GJ 436, a
field-age, M2.5V star ($P_\mathrm{rot}\approx44$ d) orbited by a warm,
Neptune-size planet ($M \approx 25\ M_\oplus$, $R \approx 4.1\ R_\oplus$,
$P_\mathrm{orb}\approx2.6$ d). Observations at three epochs from 2012 to 2018
span nearly a full activity cycle, sample two rotations of the star and two
orbital periods of the planet, and reveal a multitude of brief flares. Over
2012-2018, the star's $7.75\pm0.10$ yr activity cycle produced the largest
observed variations, $38\pm3$% in the summed flux of major FUV emission lines.
In 2018, variability due to rotation was $8\pm2$%. An additional $11\pm1$%
scatter at 10 min cadence, treated as white noise in fits, likely has both
instrumental and astrophysical origins. Flares increased time-averaged emission
by 15% over the 0.88 d of cumulative exposure, peaking as high as 25$\times$
quiescence. We interpret these flare values as lower limits given that flares
too weak or too infrequent to have been observed likely exist. GJ 436's flare
frequency distribution (FFD) at FUV wavelengths is unusual compared to other
field-age M dwarfs, exhibiting a statistically-significant dearth of high
energy ($>4\times 10^{28}$ erg) events that we hypothesize to be the result of
a magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) triggering premature flares. If an SPI
is present, GJ 436 b's magnetic field strength must be $\lesssim$100 G to
explain the statistically insignificant increase in orbit-phased FUV emission.
  *Erratum Pending:* Due to an arithmetic error, the published limit on the
magnetic field strength is incorrect. The correct limit is $\lesssim$10~G.

not a classic RL problem, thus invalidates standard RL methods. To remedy this
issue, we develop a reward shaping approach, leveraging properties of the $F_1$

handle the combinatorially complex state space, we propose a Semi-Model-based

trains efficiently and identifies all Pareto-front solutions. Across all tasks,
SM-DDPO is able to achieve state-of-the-art diagnosis accuracy (in some cases

$1.61 \times 10^{-14}$ for dark photons with a mass of 215 eV. For the DFSZ and

found [SII]/H$\alpha$ $>$ 0.5 for the SE and E regions, which supports the
origin of the emission being from shock-heated gas. The average [SII]/H$\alpha$
ratio is found to be $\sim$0.4 and $\sim$0.3 for the NW and NE regions,

in an HII region. From the ratios of [SII]$\lambda\lambda$ 6716/6731, we
estimate an average electron density of $\sim$2400 cm$^{-3}$ for the NW region,
which can be attributed to the dense ionized gas. The average
[SII]$\lambda\lambda$ 6716/6731 ratios are $\sim$1.25 and $\sim$1.15 for the SE

explains it post hoc. Blackbox models are flexible but difficult to explain,
while interpretable models are inherently explainable. Yet, interpretable
models require extensive ML knowledge and tend to be less flexible and
underperforming than their Blackbox variants. This paper aims to blur the
distinction between a post hoc explanation of a Blackbox and constructing
interpretable models. Beginning with a Blackbox, we iteratively carve out a
mixture of interpretable experts (MoIE) and a residual network. Each
interpretable model specializes in a subset of samples and explains them using
First Order Logic (FOL), providing basic reasoning on concepts from the
Blackbox. We route the remaining samples through a flexible residual. We repeat
the method on the residual network until all the interpretable models explain
the desired proportion of data. Our extensive experiments show that our route,
interpret, and repeat approach (1) identifies a diverse set of
instance-specific concepts with high concept completeness via MoIE without
compromising in performance, (2) identifies the relatively harder samples to
explain via residuals, (3) outperforms the interpretable by-design models by
significant margins during test-time interventions, and (4) fixes the shortcut

on wind turbines. The shape of the ice is subject to large uncertainties, so
uncertainty quantification (UQ) is needed for a reliable prediction of its
effects. In this study, a set of experimentally measured wind tunnel ice shapes
serves as input data. Using principal component analysis, a set of linearly
uncorrelated geometric modes is constructed from the data, which serves as
random input to the UQ simulation. For uncertainty propagation, non-intrusive
polynomial chaos expansion (NIPC), multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) and
multi-fidelity Monte Carlo control variate (MFMC) methods are employed and
compared. As a baseline model, large eddy simulations are carried out using the
discontinuous Galerkin flow solver FLEXI. UQ simulations are carried out with
the in-house framework POUNCE (Propagation of Uncertainties). Its focus is on a
high level of automation and efficiency considerations in a high performance
computing environment. Due to the high number of samples, the simulation tool
chain of the baseline model is completely automatized, including a new
structured surface mesh generator for highly irregular domain shapes. Results
show that forces on the airfoil vary considerably due to the uncertain ice
shape. All three methods prove to be suited to predict mean and standard
deviation. In the Monte Carlo techniques, the choice and performance of
low-fidelity models is shown to be decisive for estimator variance reduction.
The MFMC method performs best in this study.

the transmission function, and its origin is deeply connected to the topology
of the atomic structure, which we discuss in terms of symmetry arguments
supported by numerical simulations. A systematic analysis of the influence of
system size on the transmission function reveals that the DQI antiresonance
persists for large systems in the ballistic regime and establishes the quantum
confinement gap as the intrinsic resolution limit to detect QI effects.
Furthermore, we consider the influence of disorder, electron-electron and
electron-phonon interactions, and provide quantitative criteria for the
robustness of DQI in their presence. We find that the conductance is quite
sensitive to perturbations, and its value alone may not be sufficient to
characterize the QI properties of a junction. Instead, the characteristic
behavior of the transmission function is more resilient, and we suggest it
retains information on the presence of an antiresonance even if DQI is
partially concealed or suppressed. At the same time, DQI results in a
non-linear transport regime in the current-bias characteristics that can be
possibly detected in transport experiments.

and policies of an agent can be improved by using more computation without

However, learning accurate estimates of the model is hard. Subsequently, the
natural question is whether we can get similar benefits as planning with
model-free methods. Experience replay is an essential component of many
model-free algorithms enabling sample-efficient learning and stability by
providing a mechanism to store past experiences for further reuse in the
gradient computational process. Prior works have established connections
between models and experience replay by planning with the latter. This involves
increasing the number of times a mini-batch is sampled and used for updates at
each step (amount of replay per step). We attempt to exploit this connection by
doing a systematic study on the effect of varying amounts of replay per step in
a well-known model-free algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN) in the Mountain Car

each queue processes jobs at rate $n$ and the total arrival rate to the system
is $nK-\upsilon \sqrt{n}$ where $\upsilon \in (0, \infty)$ and $n$ is large. We
study rank-based routing policies in which $O(\sqrt{n})$ of the incoming jobs
are routed to servers with probabilities depending on their ranked queue length
and the remaining jobs are routed uniformly at random. A particular case,
referred to as the marginal join-the-shortest-queue (MJSQ) policy, is one in
which the $O(\sqrt{n})$ jobs are routed using the join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ)
policy. Our first result provides a heavy traffic approximation theorem for
such queuing systems. It turns out that, unlike the JSQ system, there is no
state space collapse in the setting of MJSQ (and for the more general
rank-based routing schemes) and one obtains a novel diffusion limit which is
the constrained analogue of the well studied Atlas model (and other rank-based
diffusions) arising from mathematical finance. Next, we prove an interchange of
limits result which shows that the steady state of the queuing system is well
approximated by that of the limiting diffusion, given explicitly in terms of
product laws of Exponential random variables. Using these results, we compute
the time asymptotic workload in the heavy traffic limit for the MJSQ system. We
find the striking result that although in going from JSQ to MJSQ the
communication cost is reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{n}$, the asymptotic
workload increases only by a constant factor which can be made arbitrarily
close to one by increasing a MJSQ parameter. When the system is overloaded
($\upsilon<0$) we show that although the $K$-dimensional MJSQ system is
unstable, the steady state difference between the maximum and minimum queue
lengths stays bounded in probability (in the heavy traffic parameter $n$).

Experimental results show that the new Hadamard layer substantially improves
the performance of the investigated models (variants of the Pix2Pix model). The
performance's improvement can be explained by the Hadamard layer forcing the
network to produce an internal encoding of the classes so that all bins are

the Hadamard layer requires that to change the predicted class, it is necessary
to modify $2^{k-1}$ bins, assuming $k$ bins in the encoding. A specific loss

insights from wide NN kernel theory to improve signal propagation in vanilla
DNNs (which we define as networks without skips or normalisation). However,
these approaches are incompatible with the self-attention layers present in
transformers, whose kernels are intrinsically more complicated to analyse and
control. And so the question remains: is it possible to train deep vanilla
transformers? We answer this question in the affirmative by designing several
approaches that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices
and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in
vanilla transformers. Our methods address various intricacies specific to
signal propagation in transformers, including the interaction with positional
encoding and causal masking. In experiments on WikiText-103 and C4, our
approaches enable deep transformers without normalisation to train at speeds
matching their standard counterparts, and deep vanilla transformers to reach
the same performance as standard ones after about 5 times more iterations.

wavelengths can trace galaxy overdensities. We perform the first systematic
search for protoclusters around a homogeneously selected sample of 12
spectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z\sim1.2-5.3$ in
the GOODS-N field. We applied the Poisson Probability Method (PPM) to search
for Mpc scale overdensities around these SMGs using three photometric redshift
catalogs. We detect galaxy overdensities for 11 out of the 12 SMGs
($92\%\pm8$\%), distributed over eight protoclusters. We confirm three
previously discovered protoclusters, and we detect five new ones around the
SMGs SMMJ123634 ($z=1.225$), ID.19 ($z=2.047$), SMMJ123607 ($z=2.487$),
SMMJ123606 ($z=2.505$), and GN10 ($z=5.303$). A wavelet-based analysis shows
that the SMGs live in protocluster cores with a complex morphology (compact,
filamentary, or clumpy) and an average size of $\sim(0.4-1)$Mpc. By comparing
the PPM results obtained using independently the three redshift catalogs, we
possibly witness a transitioning phase at $z\gtrsim4$ for the galaxy
populations. While $z\lesssim4$ protoclusters appear to be populated by dusty
galaxies, those at highest redshifts $z\sim5$ are detected as overdensities of
Lyman$\alpha$ emitters or Lyman break galaxies. We also find a good correlation
between the molecular (H$_2$) gas mass of the SMG and the overdensity
significance. To explain the overall phenomenology, we suggest that galaxy
interactions in dense environments likely triggered the starburst and gas-rich
phase of the SMGs. Altogether, we support the scenario that SMGs are excellent
tracers of distant protoclusters. Those presented in this work are excellent
targets for the {\it James Webb Space Telescope.} Surveys with forthcoming
facilities (e.g., {\it Euclid}, LSST) can be tuned to detect even larger
samples of distant protoclusters.

brain functional connectivity, measured under resting and cognitive states,

subtypes through clustering or subtyping analyses on multi-state functional
connectivity, few existing approaches are applicable here to accommodate the

To address this issue, we propose an innovative Bayesian nonparametric

functional network patterns integrating different cognitive states. In light of
the existing neuroscience literature, we assume there are unknown
state-specific modular structures within functional connectivity and
simultaneously impose selection to identify informative network features for

use, we develop a computationally efficient variational inference algorithm to
perform posterior inference with satisfactory estimation accuracy. Extensive
simulations show the superior clustering accuracy and plausible result of our

perpetuation of the same harms and the creation of novel ones. In response, the
FATE community has emphasized the importance of anticipating harms. Our work
focuses on the anticipation of harms from increasingly agentic systems. Rather
than providing a definition of agency as a binary property, we identify 4 key
characteristics which, particularly in combination, tend to increase the agency
of a given algorithmic system: underspecification, directness of impact,
goal-directedness, and long-term planning. We also discuss important harms
which arise from increasing agency -- notably, these include systemic and/or
long-range impacts, often on marginalized stakeholders. We emphasize that
recognizing agency of algorithmic systems does not absolve or shift the human
responsibility for algorithmic harms. Rather, we use the term agency to
highlight the increasingly evident fact that ML systems are not fully under
human control. Our work explores increasingly agentic algorithmic systems in
three parts. First, we explain the notion of an increase in agency for
algorithmic systems in the context of diverse perspectives on agency across

increasingly agentic systems. Third, we discuss important harms from
increasingly agentic systems and ways forward for addressing them. We conclude

different atomic species of several spin values, offering unprecedented
opportunities to scrutinize the underlying physics of its spin phase domains
and of its quantum phase transitions. At sufficient low temperatures, lower
than the critical temperature, a fraction of thermally excited atoms of the
condensate can still interact with the whole system leading to spin-dependent
interactions that can modify the nature of its phase domains. In this work, we
characterize the thermal fraction of atoms of a spinorial BEC of general spin-f
value, provided that its ground state lies in a given spin phase with
rotational symmetry. To that end, we use the Hartree-Fock approximation and the
method we have introduced in the companion article [arXiv:2211.16428 [1]],
based on the Majorana stellar representation for mixed quantum states and
symmetry arguments. We consider the spin phases with usual point group
symmetries, including those with some exotic phases associated to the platonic
solids. The method leads to useful analytical expressions of the eigenspectrum
of the thermal cloud allowing us to study the admissible regions and multipolar
magnetic moments of the spin phases as a function of the temperature for
general spin values.

data-augmentation to enrich the training distribution of the model and
consequently improve robustness to natural distribution shifts. We propose an
alternative approach that allows the system to recover from distribution shifts
online. Specifically, our method applies a sequence of semantic-preserving

training set, as measured by the Wasserstein distance. We formulate the problem
of sequence selection as an MDP, which we solve using reinforcement learning.
To aid in our estimates of Wasserstein distance, we employ dimensionality
reduction through orthonormal projection. We provide both theoretical and
empirical evidence that orthonormal projection preserves characteristics of the
data at the distributional level. Finally, we apply our distribution shift
recovery approach to the ImageNet-C benchmark for distribution shifts,
targeting shifts due to additive noise and image histogram modifications. We
demonstrate an improvement in average accuracy up to 14.21% across a variety of

  To address this issue, models must be periodically retrained or redesigned,
which takes significant human and computational resources. Additionally,
historical data may not even exist to re-train or re-design model with. As a

Virgo gravitational-wave observatories discovered two binary mergers with
lighter companion masses ($\sim 2.6$ M$_\odot$) similar to the total mass of

could be a neutron star binary orbiting a black hole. Here we show that a
significant fraction of neutron star binaries in hierarchical triples merge

could explain the observed very early $r$-process enrichment. The neutron star
binary can become eccentric via von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations, promoting
a fast coalescence followed later by a merger of the low-mass black hole with
the higher-mass black hole in the system. We show that this scenario is also
consistent with an overall binary neutron star merger rate density of $\sim100$

Ratio Shift Keying (RSK), where the information is encoded in the concentration
ratio of two different types of molecules. RSK modulation is hypothesized to
enable accurate information transfer in dynamic MC scenarios where the
time-varying channel characteristics affect both types of molecules equally. To
validate this hypothesis, we first conduct an information-theoretical analysis
of RSK modulation and derive the capacity of the end-to-end MC channel where
the receiver estimates concentration ratio based on ligand-receptor binding
statistics in an optimal or suboptimal manner. We then analyze the error
performance of RSK modulation in a practical time-varying MC scenario, that is
mobile MC, in which both the transmitter and the receiver undergo
diffusion-based propagation. Our numerical and analytical results, obtained for
varying levels of similarity between the ligand types used for ratio-encoding,

The more readily assigned CO2-Arn species tend to be those with symmetric
structures, and CO2-Ar17 represents completion of a highly symmetric (D5h)
solvation shell. Those not assigned (e.g. n = 7, 13) are probably also present
in the observed spectra, but with band structures which are not well-resolved
and thus not recognizable. The spectra of CO2-Ar9, -Ar15, and -Ar17 suggest the
presence of sequences involving very low frequency (~2 cm-1) cluster
vibrational modes, an interpretation which should be amenable to theoretical
confirmation (or rejection).

long-term continuous health monitoring by cooperative in-body nanomachines,
have been proposed, MC is still in its infancy when it comes to practical
implementation. In particular, long-term experiments and applications face
issues such as exhaustion of signaling molecules (SMs) at the transmitter (TX)
and interference by SMs from previous transmissions at the receiver (RX). To
overcome these practical burdens, a new class of SMs with switchable states
seems to be promising. For example, certain switchable SMs can be switched
between two states, whereupon the sensitivity of the RX depends on the state.
Hence, only molecules in one of the states are observable at the RX. Assuming
that the SMs are already inside the channel, the TX can switch them to the
observable state by applying an appropriate trigger. Later, to prevent
interference, an eraser (EX) may switch the SMs back to the non-observable
state and they can remain in the channel until they get reused for another
transmission. In this work, we provide an overview of existing switchable SMs,
and classify them according to their properties. Furthermore, we highlight how
switchable SMs can be utilized for media modulation. In addition, we present
first experimental results for a system employing the $\textit{green
fluorescent protein variant ""Dreiklang""}$ (GFPD) as switchable SM. Finally, we
discuss media modulation specific challenges and opportunities.

In addition, due to high labour costs, it is rare for social media datasets to

graph representation-based methods for detecting social events from
heterogeneous social media environments. For cases where a dataset has labels,
we designed a Hyperbolic Social Event Detection (HSED) model that converts
complex social information into a unified social message graph. This model
addresses the heterogeneity of social media, and, with this graph, the
information in social media can be used to capture structural information based
on the properties of hyperbolic space. For cases where the dataset is

(UHSED). This model is based on the HSED model but includes graph contrastive
learning to make it work in unlabelled scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approaches.

find optimal trajectories that maximise throughput and power transfer to the
underwater nodes while minimising energy consumption. To the best of our

for linear contextual bandits, which interpolates the regret for the worst-case
regime and the deterministic reward regime. However, these algorithms are
either computationally intractable or unable to handle unknown variance of the
noise. In this paper, we present a novel solution to this open problem by
proposing the first computationally efficient algorithm for linear bandits with
heteroscedastic noise. Our algorithm is adaptive to the unknown variance of
noise and achieves an $\tilde{O}(d \sqrt{\sum_{k = 1}^K \sigma_k^2} + d)$
regret, where $\sigma_k^2$ is the variance of the noise at the round $k$, $d$
is the dimension of the contexts and $K$ is the total number of rounds. Our
results are based on an adaptive variance-aware confidence set enabled by a new
Freedman-type concentration inequality for self-normalized martingales and a
multi-layer structure to stratify the context vectors into different layers
with different uniform upper bounds on the uncertainty.
  Furthermore, our approach can be extended to linear mixture Markov decision
processes (MDPs) in reinforcement learning. We propose a variance-adaptive
algorithm for linear mixture MDPs, which achieves a problem-dependent
horizon-free regret bound that can gracefully reduce to a nearly constant
regret for deterministic MDPs. Unlike existing nearly minimax optimal
algorithms for linear mixture MDPs, our algorithm does not require explicit
variance estimation of the transitional probabilities or the use of high-order
moment estimators to attain horizon-free regret. We believe the techniques
developed in this paper can have independent value for general online decision
making problems.

  Understanding the effects of torus models","20 pages, 10 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stad589",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  UV-FIR SED modeling is an effective way to disentangle emission between star
formation (SF) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies; however, this
approach becomes uncertain for composite AGN/SF galaxies that comprise 50-70%
of IR-samples. Cosmic X-ray background (XRB) models require a large fraction of
obscured AGN to reproduce the observed XRB peak, motivating reliable SED
analyses in objects where the AGN may be ``buried"" in the galaxy and in the
mid-IR to far-IR SED. In this paper, we study a 24$\mu$m-selected ($S_{24}$ >
100$\mu$Jy) sample of 95 galaxies with $0 \% < f_{MIR,AGN} < 100 \%$, 0.4 < z <
2.7, and $10^{11}$L$_{\odot}$ < L$_{IR}$ < $10^{13}$L$_{\odot}$. We test the
performance of AGN models ranging in torus optical depth via SED fitting,
comparing results with Spitzer MIR spectroscopy and X-ray observations.
Best-fit torus optical depth can shed light on whether these galaxies host a
luminous obscured AGN population. We find that permitting a broader AGN SED
parameter space results in improved fit quality with higher optical depths,
higher FIR AGN contributions, and higher $L_{Bol}$, impacting the bright-end of
the $L_{Bol}$ luminosity function. Our results suggest there may be a
population of dust-obscured composites that are bolometrically significant but
have their AGN mostly hidden in the mid-IR SED. If so, literature applications
of SED fitting that often simplify AGN models or omit optically thick tori may
largely underestimate AGN contribution from composite sources, as these sources
are both numerous and have solutions sensitive to the assumed range of AGN
models.

the dynamics of many moves and that other moves are compatible with

reflect recent changes that have happened in chess, namely the introduction of

that Sun-like stars frequently host exoplanets. These exoplanets are subject to
fluxes of ionizing radiation in the form of X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
radiation that may cause changes in their atmospheric dynamics and chemistry.
While X-ray fluxes can be observed directly, EUV fluxes cannot be observed
because of severe interstellar medium absorption. Here, we present a new
empirical method to estimate the whole stellar XUV (X-ray plus EUV) and FUV
spectra as a function of total unsigned magnetic fluxes of stars. The response
of the solar XUV and FUV spectrum (0.1-180 nm) to the solar total unsigned
magnetic flux is investigated by using the long-term Sun-as-a-star dataset over
10 yrs, and the power-law relation is obtained for each wavelength with a
spectral resolution of 0.1-1 nm. We applied the scaling relations to active
young Sun-like stars (G-dwarfs), EK Dra (G1.5V), $\pi^1$ Uma (G1.5V) and
$\kappa^1$ Ceti (G5V), and found that the observed spectra (except for the
unobservable longward EUV wavelength) are roughly consistent with the extension
of the derived power-law relations with errors of an order of magnitude. This
suggests that our model is a valuable method to derive the XUV/FUV fluxes of
Sun-like stars including the EUV band mostly absorbed at wavelengths longward
of 36 nm. We also discuss differences between the solar extensions and stellar

simultaneous observations of magnetic and XUV/FUV fluxes are necessary for
further validations.

explore various policies encoded in a neural network (NN) with the goal of
maximizing the reward function. However, this approach can lead to infeasible
solutions that violate physical constraints such as power flow equations,
voltage limits, and dynamic constraints. Ensuring these constraints are met is
crucial in power systems, as they are a safety critical infrastructure. To
address this issue, existing DRL algorithms remedy the problem by projecting
the actions onto the feasible set, which can result in sub-optimal solutions.
This paper presents a novel primal-dual approach for learning optimal

of controlling power generations and battery outputs. We also prove the

time prohibitive to acquire. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising
pre-training and feature extraction solution for many downstream tasks, as it
only uses unlabeled data. Recently, SSL methods based on instance
discrimination have gained popularity in the medical imaging domain. However,
SSL pre-trained encoders may use many clues in the image to discriminate an
instance that are not necessarily disease-related. Moreover, pathological
patterns are often subtle and heterogeneous, requiring the ability of the
desired method to represent anatomy-specific features that are sensitive to
abnormal changes in different body parts. In this work, we present a novel SSL
framework, named DrasCLR, for 3D medical imaging to overcome these challenges.
We propose two domain-specific contrastive learning strategies: one aims to
capture subtle disease patterns inside a local anatomical region, and the other
aims to represent severe disease patterns that span larger regions. We
formulate the encoder using conditional hyper-parameterized network, in which
the parameters are dependant on the anatomical location, to extract
anatomically sensitive features. Extensive experiments on large-scale computer
tomography (CT) datasets of lung images show that our method improves the
performance of many downstream prediction and segmentation tasks. The
patient-level representation improves the performance of the patient survival
prediction task. We show how our method can detect emphysema subtypes via dense
prediction. We demonstrate that fine-tuning the pre-trained model can
significantly reduce annotation efforts without sacrificing emphysema detection
accuracy. Our ablation study highlights the importance of incorporating
anatomical context into the SSL framework.

the source position and angle measurement noise at the same time by seeking a

achieved by seeking the center and radius of the corresponding inscribed

deployed to either: i) maintain constant communication but potentially
sacrifice operational efficiency due to proximity constraints or ii) allow
disconnections to increase environmental coverage efficiency, challenges on
how, when, and where to reconnect (rendezvous problem). In this work we tackle
the latter problem and notice that most state-of-the-art methods assume that
robots will be able to execute a predetermined plan; however system failures
and changes in environmental conditions can cause the robots to deviate from
the plan with cascading effects across the multi-robot system. This paper
proposes a coordinated epistemic prediction and planning framework to achieve
consensus without communicating for exploration and coverage, task discovery
and completion, and rendezvous applications. Dynamic epistemic logic is the
principal component implemented to allow robots to propagate belief states and
empathize with other agents. Propagation of belief states and subsequent
coverage of the environment is achieved via a frontier-based method within an
artificial physics-based framework. The proposed framework is validated with
both simulations and experiments with unmanned ground vehicles in various
cluttered environments.

be able to adapt to changes in appearance caused by environmental factors such

incorporate these changes is a promising solution, but it can be
computationally costly. Our proposed approach is to selectively adapt the
detector only when necessary, using new data that does not have the same
distribution as the current training data. To this end, we investigate three
popular metrics for domain gap evaluation and find that there is a correlation
between the domain gap and detection accuracy. Therefore, we apply the domain
gap as a criterion to decide when to adapt the detector. Our experiments show
that our approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of the detector's
operation in real-world scenarios, where environmental conditions change in a

controlled precipitation of specific intermetallic phases, whose identity and
crystal structure can be difficult to predict. Here, we investigate the Al-Pt
system, which shows some similarity to the Al-Cu system as one of their main
intermetallic phases, $Al_2Pt$, is nearly isostructural with $\theta^{\prime}
(Al_2Cu)$, the metastable phase responsible for the high-strength of Al-Cu
alloys. However, phases in Al-Pt alloys are complex and have not been studied
in detail. Using a combination of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations
and classical nucleation theory (CNT) applied to the Al-Pt system, we design a
workflow to predict the thermodynamics of solid solution, intermediate phases
such as GP zones, stable and metastable precipitates, and their precipitation
sequence. This workflow can be applied to an arbitrary binary alloying system.
We confirm the known stable phases $Al_4Pt$, $Al_{21}Pt_8$, $Al_2Pt$,
$Al_3Pt_2$, $AlPt (\alpha \& \beta)$, $Al_3Pt_5$, $AlPt_2 (\alpha \& \beta)$
and $AlPt_3 (\alpha \& \beta)$. We also reveal the possible existence of two
phases of chemical formulae $Al_5Pt$ and $Al_3Pt$. This large number of
intermetallic phases is due to the strong bonding between Al and Pt, which also
leads to significant favourable Pt solute formation energy in the Al matrix.
Our findings are compared with the known precipitation characteristics of the
binary Al-Cu and Al-Au systems. We find that the $\theta^{\prime}$-like
$Al_2Pt$ precipitate phase has a lower coherent interfacial energy than
$\theta^{\prime}$. Our calculations strongly suggest that $Al_2Pt$ will
precipitate first in Al-rich Al-Pt alloys and will form bulk-like interfaces
similar to $\eta (Al_2Au)$ rather than like $\theta^{\prime}(Al_2Cu)$.

proved to be significant factor for node classification problem. But we find

develop a case study for the Texas Gulf Coast using storm surge maps developed

quantifies the similarity between two clients' data distributions without

overfitting problem at clients and dramatically boosts the training scheme's

resolution and legibility of the text images, and the resulting images will
significantly affect the performance of downstream tasks. Although numerous
progress has been made, existing approaches raise two crucial issues: (1) They
neglect the global structure of the text, which bounds the semantic determinism
of the scene text. (2) The priors, e.g., text prior or stroke prior, employed
in existing works, are extracted from pre-trained text recognizers. That said,
such priors suffer from the domain gap including low resolution and blurriness
caused by poor imaging conditions, leading to incorrect guidance. Our work
addresses these gaps and proposes a plug-and-play module dubbed Dual Prior
Modulation Network (DPMN), which leverages dual image-level priors to bring
performance gain over existing approaches. Specifically, two types of
prior-guided refinement modules, each using the text mask or graphic
recognition result of the low-quality SR image from the preceding layer, are
designed to improve the structural clarity and semantic accuracy of the text,
respectively. The following attention mechanism hence modulates two
quality-enhanced images to attain a superior SR result. Extensive experiments
validate that our method improves the image quality and boosts the performance
of downstream tasks over five typical approaches on the benchmark. Substantial
visualizations and ablation studies demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
DPMN. Code is available at: https://github.com/jdfxzzy/DPMN.

drives autonomous determination by the definition of frontier information, so
that complete information about the environment is available to the quadrotor.
However, existing frontier-based methods are able to accomplish the task but
still suffer from inefficient exploration. How to improve the efficiency of
autonomous exploration is the focus of current research. Typical problems
include slow frontier generation, which affects real-time viewpoint
determination, and insufficient determination methods that affect the quality
of viewpoints. Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a
two-level viewpoint determination method for frontier-based autonomous

heterogeneous information networks (HINs). To preserve the heterogeneous
semantics on HINs, the rich node/edge types become a cornerstone of HIN
representation learning. However, in real-world scenarios, type information is
often noisy, missing or inaccessible. Assuming no type information is given, we
define a so-called latent heterogeneous graph (LHG), which carries latent
heterogeneous semantics as the node/edge types cannot be observed. In this
paper, we study the challenging and unexplored problem of link prediction on an
LHG. As existing approaches depend heavily on type-based information, they are
suboptimal or even inapplicable on LHGs. To address the absence of type
information, we propose a model named LHGNN, based on the novel idea of
semantic embedding at node and path levels, to capture latent semantics on and
between nodes. We further design a personalization function to modulate the
heterogeneous contexts conditioned on their latent semantics w.r.t. the target
node, to enable finer-grained aggregation. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the superior
performance of LHGNN.

EHRs related to chronic diseases can be efficiently done using dynamic
treatment regimes (DTRs), which are a set of sequential decision rules. While
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a widely used method for creating DTRs, there is
ongoing research in developing RL algorithms that can effectively handle large

Q-learning algorithm, for generating DTRs. The novelties of our research are as
follows: 1) From a methodological perspective, we present a novel and scalable
approach for generating DTRs by combining distributed learning with Q-learning.
The proposed approach is specifically designed to handle large amounts of data
and effectively generate DTRs. 2) From a theoretical standpoint, we provide
generalization error bounds for the proposed distributed Q-learning algorithm,
which are derived within the framework of statistical learning theory. These
bounds quantify the relationships between sample size, prediction accuracy, and
computational burden, providing insights into the performance of the algorithm.
3) From an applied perspective, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our

challenging, particularly for high-dimensional continuous action spaces. To
alleviate this difficulty, we propose a new sampling-based online POMDP solver,
called Adaptive Discretization using Voronoi Trees (ADVT). It uses Monte Carlo
Tree Search in combination with an adaptive discretization of the action space
as well as optimistic optimization to efficiently sample high-dimensional
continuous action spaces and compute the best action to perform. Specifically,
we adaptively discretize the action space for each sampled belief using a
hierarchical partition called Voronoi tree, which is a Binary Space
Partitioning that implicitly maintains the partition of a cell as the Voronoi
diagram of two points sampled from the cell. ADVT uses the estimated diameters
of the cells to form an upper-confidence bound on the action value function
within the cell, guiding the Monte Carlo Tree Search expansion and further
discretization of the action space. This enables ADVT to better exploit local
information with respect to the action value function, allowing faster
identification of the most promising regions in the action space, compared to
existing solvers. Voronoi trees keep the cost of partitioning and estimating
the diameter of each cell low, even in high-dimensional spaces where many
sampled points are required to cover the space well. ADVT additionally handles
continuous observation spaces, by adopting an observation progressive widening
strategy, along with a weighted particle representation of beliefs.
Experimental results indicate that ADVT scales substantially better to
high-dimensional continuous action spaces, compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

approach to produce bulk-scale graphene with a high crystallinity and high

sponge and the aggregate samples confirms the importance of accessibility of
ethanol-derived species into the internal area. By investigating the effect of
treatment temperature, a higher random-stacking ratio is obtained at 1500
{\deg}C. Moreover, the AB-stacking fraction was reduced to less than 10% by
introducing cellulose nanofiber as a spacer to prevent direct stacking of

is first estimated by the cosine similarity between reference phone embedding

used to map a sequence of phone embeddings, acoustic embeddings along with
their similarity measures to predict the final utterance-level score.
Experimental results on the non-native databases suggest that the proposed

leveraging both observational data and available physical laws.
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep operator networks (DeepONets)
are two such models. The former encodes the physical laws via the automatic
differentiation, while the latter learns the hidden physics from data.
Generally, the noisy and limited observational data as well as the
overparameterization in neural networks (NNs) result in uncertainty in
predictions from deep learning models. In [1], a Bayesian framework based on
the {{Generative Adversarial Networks}} (GAN) has been proposed as a unified
model to quantify uncertainties in predictions of PINNs as well as DeepONets.
Specifically, the proposed approach in [1] has two stages: (1) prior learning,
and (2) posterior estimation. At the first stage, the GANs are employed to
learn a functional prior either from a prescribed function distribution, e.g.,
Gaussian process, or from historical data and available physics. At the second
stage, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) method is utilized to estimate the
posterior in the latent space of GANs. However, the vanilla HMC does not
support the mini-batch training, which limits its applications in problems with
big data. In the present work, we propose to use the normalizing flow (NF)
models in the context of variational inference, which naturally enables the
minibatch training, as the alternative to HMC for posterior estimation in the
latent space of GANs. A series of numerical experiments, including a nonlinear
differential equation problem and a 100-dimensional Darcy problem, are
conducted to demonstrate that NF with full-/mini-batch training are able to
achieve similar accuracy as the ``gold rule'' HMC.

environmental conditions' knowledge, enabling near-optimal performance at
considerably lower effective sampling rates. Designed to robustly perform under
variable weather conditions, the algorithm was shown on the Oxford raw radar
and RADIATE dataset to achieve accurate reconstruction utilizing only 10% of
the original samples in good weather and 20% in extreme (snow, fog) weather
conditions. A further modification of the algorithm incorporates object motion
to enable reliable identification of important regions. This includes
monitoring possible future occlusions caused by objects detected in the present
frame. Finally, we train a YOLO network on the RADIATE dataset to perform
object detection directly on RADAR data and obtain a 6.6% AP50 improvement over
the baseline Faster R-CNN network.

in nature, the violation of which implies a breakdown of space-time symmetry.
The Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) is intrinsic in nature and its effects

The effect of LIV is treated as a perturbation to the standard neutrino

helium distribution of GK-type main sequence dwarfs in an old ($\sim$12.5 Gyr)
GC in the Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 2210, using the deep photometry observed

confirm that NGC 2210 dwarfs have a helium spread, with an internal dispersion
of $\delta{Y}\sim$0.06--0.07. The fraction of helium enriched stars depends on
the $\delta{Y}$ distribution. A continuous $\delta{Y}$ distribution would
indicate that more than half of MS stars are helium enriched ($\sim$55\%). If
the $\delta{Y}$ distribution is discrete (bimodal), a fraction of $\sim$30\%

capitalize on the cyclical nature of quantum state probabilities observed on

superimposed rotations around the Bloch Sphere. The approach presented here has
the advantage of employing a single qubit per block. Thus, it is linear with
respect to the number of blocks, not polynomial with respect to the number of

employs classical parameters, a large number of iterations and updates at
training can be effected without dwelling on coherence times and the gradients
can be reused and stored if necessary. We also show how an analogy can be drawn

approximate ABFT, namely ApproxABFT, to invoke the error recovery procedure
only when the computing errors are significant enough, which skips many useless

Conventional two-sample MR methods often employ the same sample for selecting
relevant genetic variants and for constructing final causal estimates. Such a
practice often leads to biased causal effect estimates due to the well known
""winner's curse"" phenomenon. To address this fundamental challenge, we first
examine its consequence on causal effect estimation both theoretically and
empirically. We then propose a novel framework that systematically breaks the
winner's curse, leading to unbiased association effect estimates for the
selected genetic variants. Building upon the proposed framework, we introduce a
novel rerandomized inverse variance weighted estimator that is consistent when
selection and parameter estimation are conducted on the same sample. Under
appropriate conditions, we show that the proposed RIVW estimator for the causal

be well estimated. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of our approach

wave is produced by the lens? In this work we address this question by
considering a supermassive black hole binary at the center of the lens emitting
gravitational waves propagating either colinearly or orthogonally to the line
of sight. Specializing to an Einstein ring configuration (where the source, the
lens and the observer are aligned), we show that the gravitational wave induces
changes on the ring's angular size and on the optical path of photons. The
changes are the same for a given pair of antipodal points on the ring, but
maximally different for any pair separated by $90^{\circ}$. For realistic
lenses and binaries, we find that the change in the angular size of the
Einstein ring is dozens of orders of magnitude smaller than the precision of
current experiments. On the other hand, the difference in the optical path
induced on a photon by a gravitational wave propagating \textit{orthogonally}
to the line of sight triggers, at peak strain, time delays in the range $\sim

the difference of discriminate representations for different objectives
degrades performance; (2) seesaw phenomenon, where the optimizer focuses on one

increasing interest in recent research. As one of the most common techniques,
pruning has been studied for a long time. By exploiting the structured sparsity
of the neural network, existing methods can prune neurons instead of individual
weights. However, in most existing pruning methods, surviving neurons are
randomly connected in the neural network without any structure, and the
non-zero weights within each neuron are also randomly distributed. Such
irregular sparse structure can cause very high control overhead and irregular
memory access for the hardware and even increase the neural network
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a three-layer hierarchical
prior to promote a more regular sparse structure during pruning. The proposed
three-layer hierarchical prior can achieve per-neuron weight-level structured
sparsity and neuron-level structured sparsity. We derive an efficient
Turbo-variational Bayesian inferencing (Turbo-VBI) algorithm to solve the
resulting model compression problem with the proposed prior. The proposed
Turbo-VBI algorithm has low complexity and can support more general priors than
existing model compression algorithms. Simulation results show that our
proposed algorithm can promote a more regular structure in the pruned neural
networks while achieving even better performance in terms of compression rate
and inferencing accuracy compared with the baselines.

models, but it introduces a significant amount of computational overhead to the
training cost, as the method requires acquiring teacher supervisions on
training samples. This additional cost -- called distillation cost -- is most
pronounced when we employ large-scale teacher models such as vision
transformers (ViTs). We present MaskedKD, a simple yet effective strategy that
can significantly reduce the cost of distilling ViTs without sacrificing the
prediction accuracy of the student model. Specifically, MaskedKD diminishes the
cost of running teacher at inference by masking a fraction of image patch
tokens fed to the teacher, and therefore skipping the computations required to
process those patches. The mask locations are selected to prevent masking away
the core features of an image that the student model uses for prediction. This
mask selection mechanism operates based on some attention score of the student
model, which is already computed during the student forward pass, and thus
incurs almost no additional computation. Without sacrificing the final student
accuracy, MaskedKD dramatically reduces the amount of computations required for
distilling ViTs. We demonstrate that MaskedKD can save up the distillation cost
by $50\%$ without any student performance drop, leading to approximately $28\%$
drop in the overall training FLOPs.

obtained by adding $k-2$ new vertices to each edge of a graph $G$, for $k \geq

Here, we express the entire spectrum (that is, we determine all multiplicities

of $G$. Moreover, we give an explicit expression for the multiplicity of the
spectral radius of $G^{(k)}$. Our results are mainly obtained by exploiting the
so-called trace formula to determine the spectral moments of $G^{(k)}$. As a
side result, we show that the number of parity-closed walks of given length is
the corresponding spectral moment averaged over all signed graphs with

$G^{(k)}$ to $k=2$, thereby introducing a pseudo-characteristic function. Among
other results, we show that this function is the geometric mean of the
characteristic polynomials of all signed graphs on $G$ and characterize when it

arithmetic mean of the characteristic polynomials of all signed graphs on $G$

datasets containing plenty of manually labeled tests to evaluate performance.
While constructing datasets often costs many resources, the performance on the

loss. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose an automated test
generation method for detecting erroneous behaviors of various NLP
applications. Our method is designed based on the sentence parsing process of
classic linguistics, and thus it is capable of assembling basic grammatical
elements and adjuncts into a grammatically correct test with proper oracle

exploit the potential of seed sentences to automate the test generation.
NLPLego disassembles the seed sentence into the template and adjuncts and then
generates new sentences by assembling context-appropriate adjuncts with the
template in a specific order. Unlike the taskspecific methods, the tests
generated by NLPLego have derivation relations and different degrees of
variation, which makes constructing appropriate metamorphic relations easier.
Thus, NLPLego is general, meaning it can meet the testing requirements of
various NLP applications. To validate NLPLego, we experiment with three common
NLP tasks, identifying failures in four state-of-art models. Given seed tests
from SQuAD 2.0, SST, and QQP, NLPLego successfully detects 1,732, 5301, and

approach for real-world applications. Existing few-shot segmentation methods on

classes. However, as the purpose of few-shot learning is to handle
unknown/unseen classes, such class-specific feature extraction in pretrain is
not ideal to generalize into new classes for few-shot learning. Moreover, point
cloud datasets hardly have a large number of classes due to the annotation
difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a contrastive self-supervision
framework for few-shot learning pretrain, which aims to eliminate the feature
extraction bias through class-agnostic contrastive supervision. Specifically,
we implement a novel contrastive learning approach with a learnable augmentor
for a 3D point cloud to achieve point-wise differentiation, so that to enhance
the pretrain with managed overfitting through the self-supervision.
Furthermore, we develop a multi-resolution attention module using both the
nearest and farthest points to extract the local and global point information
more effectively, and a center-concentrated multi-prototype is adopted to
mitigate the intra-class sparsity. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to
evaluate the proposed approach, which shows our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, a case study on practical CAM/CAD
segmentation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for
real-world applications.

takes advantage of a \textit{Central Contextual Information (CCI)}, which lets
each selected reusable mechanism access the rest of the slots through a

MEC services is greatly limited for the edge users of the cell due to serious
signal attenuation and inter-cell interference. User-centric MEC (UC-MEC) can
be seen as a promising solution to address this issue. In UC-MEC, each user is
served by a dedicated access point (AP) cluster enabled with MEC capability
instead of a single MEC server, however, at the expense of more energy
consumption and greater privacy risks. To achieve efficient and reliable
resource utilization with user-centric services, we propose an energy efficient
blockchain-enabled UC-MEC system where blockchain operations and resource
optimization are jointly performed. Firstly, we design a resource-aware,
reliable, replicated, redundant, and fault-tolerant (R-RAFT) consensus
mechanism to implement secure and reliable resource trading. Then, an
optimization framework based on alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is proposed to minimize the total energy consumed by wireless
transmission, consensus and task computing, where APs clustering, computing
resource allocation and bandwidth allocation are jointly considered. Simulation
results show superiority of the proposed UC-MEC system over reference schemes,
at most 33.96% reduction in the total delay and 48.77% reduction in the total
energy consumption.

dimension. For feature selection, rough set theory provides many measures,
among which mutual information is one of the most important attribute measures.
However, mutual information based importance measures are computationally
expensive and inaccurate, especially in hypersample instances, and it is
undoubtedly a NP-hard problem in high-dimensional hyperhigh-dimensional data
sets. Although many representative group intelligent algorithm feature
selection strategies have been proposed so far to improve the accuracy, there
is still a bottleneck when using these feature selection algorithms to process
high-dimensional large-scale data sets, which consumes a lot of performance and
is easy to select weakly correlated and redundant features. In this study, we
propose an incremental mutual information based improved swarm intelligent
optimization method (IMIICSO), which uses rough set theory to calculate the
importance of feature selection based on mutual information. This method
extracts decision table reduction knowledge to guide group algorithm global
search. By exploring the computation of mutual information of supersamples, we
can not only discard the useless features to speed up the internal and external
computation, but also effectively reduce the cardinality of the optimal feature
subset by using IMIICSO method, so that the cardinality is minimized by
comparison. The accuracy of feature subsets selected by the improved cockroach
swarm algorithm based on incremental mutual information is better or almost the

superior to conventional approaches without clean supervision in synthetic

proposed to eliminate the spatial correlation of noise. A study combining a
blind spot network (BSN) and asymmetric PD (AP) successfully demonstrated that
self-supervised blind denoising is applicable to real-world noisy images.
However, PD-based inference may degrade texture details in the testing phase
because high-frequency details (e.g., edges) are destroyed in the downsampled
images. To avoid such an issue, we propose self-residual learning without the
PD process to maintain texture information. We also propose an order-variant PD
constraint, noise prior loss, and an efficient inference scheme (progressive
random-replacing refinement ($\text{PR}^3$)) to boost overall performance. The
results of extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art self-supervised blind denoising approaches, including several
supervised learning methods, in terms of PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and DISTS in

only become possible with the advent of aberration-corrected (scanning)
transmission electron microscopes and two-dimensional materials that allow
imaging each lattice atom. While it has been shown for graphene that pure
knock-on damage arising from elastic scattering is sufficient to describe the
observed damage, the situation is more complicated with two-dimensional
semiconducting materials such as MoS2. Here, we measure the displacement cross
section for sulfur atoms in MoS2 with primary beam energies between 55 and 90

models. Our experimental data suggests that the displacement process can occur
from the ground state, or with single or multiple excitations, all caused by
the same impinging electron. The results bring light to reports in the recent
literature, and add necessary experimental data for a comprehensive description
of electron irradiation damage in a two-dimensional semiconducting material.
Specifically, the results agree with a combined inelastic and elastic damage
mechanism at intermediate energies, in addition to a pure elastic mechanism
that dominates above 80 keV. When the inelastic contribution is assumed to
arise through impact ionization, the associated excitation lifetime is on the
order of picoseconds, on par with expected excitation lifetimes in MoS2,
whereas it drops to some tens of femtoseconds when direct valence excitation is
considered.

enigmatic pseudogap behavior, which is at the core of understanding high-$T_c$
superconductivity, has been hotly contested as either a hallmark of preformed
Cooper pairs or an incipient order of competing interactions nearby. Here, we
report the quasi-particle scattering spectroscopy of the quantum critical
superconductor CeCoIn$_5$, where a pseudogap with energy $\Delta_g$ was
manifested as a dip in the differential conductance ($dI/dV$) below the
characteristic temperature of $T_g$. When subjected to external pressure, $T_g$
and $\Delta_g$ gradually increase, following the trend of increase in quantum
entangled hybridization between Ce 4$f$ moment and conduction electrons. On the
other hand, the superconducting (SC) energy gap and its phase transition
temperature shows a maximum, revealing a dome shape under pressure. The
disparate dependence on pressure between the two quantum states shows that the
pseudogap is less likely involved in the formation of SC Cooper pairs, but
rather is controlled by Kondo hybridization, indicating that a novel type of
pseudogap is realized in CeCoIn$_5$.

on satellite galaxies in galaxy groups and clusters ($10^{12}\,\rm M_{\odot}$
$\lesssim$ $M_{200}$ < $3 \times 10^{15}\, \rm M_{\odot}$). A star-formation
concentration index [$C$-index $= \log_{10}(r_\mathrm{50,SFR} /
r_\mathrm{50,rband})$] is defined, which measures how concentrated star
formation is relative to the stellar distribution. Both Eagle/C-Eagle and SAMI
show a higher fraction of galaxies with low $C$-index in denser environments at
$z=0-0.5$. Low $C$-index galaxies are found below the SFR-$M_{\star}$ main
sequence (MS), and display a declining specific star formation rate (sSFR) with
increasing radii, consistent with ``outside-in'' environmental quenching.
Additionally, we show that $C$-index can be used as a proxy for how long
galaxies have been satellites. These trends become weaker at increasing
redshift and are absent by $z=1-2$. We define a quenching timescale $t_{\rm
quench}$ as how long it takes satellites to transition from the MS to the
quenched population. We find that simulated galaxies experiencing
``outside-in'' environmental quenching at low redshift ($z=0\sim0.5$) have a
long quenching timescale (median $t_{\rm quench}$ > 2 Gyr). The simulated
galaxies at higher redshift ($z=0.7\sim2$) experience faster quenching (median
$t_{\rm quench}$ < 2Gyr). At $z\gtrsim 1-2$ galaxies undergoing environmental
quenching have decreased sSFR across the entire galaxy with no ``outside-in''
quenching signatures and a narrow range of $C$-index, showing that on average
environmental quenching acts differently than at $z\lesssim 1$.

that COPS particles are significantly correlated solely with GIADA fluffy
agglomerates (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.55 and p-value of $4.6\cdot

refractories and volatiles. COPS volatile volumes, which may be represented by

observed data $\{ \vx_i, y_i \}$, plays a crucial role in scientific discovery.
Despite the promising performance of existing methods, most of them conduct
symbolic regression in an \textit{offline} setting. That is, they treat the
observed data points as given ones that are simply sampled from uniform
distributions without exploring the expressive potential of data. However, for
real-world scientific problems, the data used for symbolic regression are
usually actively obtained by doing experiments, which is an \textit{online}
setting. Thus, how to obtain informative data that can facilitate the symbolic
regression process is an important problem that remains challenging.
  In this paper, we propose QUOSR, a \textbf{qu}ery-based framework for
\textbf{o}nline \textbf{s}ymbolic \textbf{r}egression that can automatically
obtain informative data in an iterative manner. Specifically, at each step,
QUOSR receives historical data points, generates new $\vx$, and then queries
the symbolic expression to get the corresponding $y$, where the $(\vx, y)$
serves as new data points. This process repeats until the maximum number of
query steps is reached. To make the generated data points informative, we
implement the framework with a neural network and train it by maximizing the
mutual information between generated data points and the target expression.
Through comprehensive experiments, we show that QUOSR can facilitate modern
symbolic regression methods by generating informative data.

filament. The strengths vary in the range of 100-600 $\mu\rm{G}$ and are
strongest along the filament's spine. The central region is sub-Alfv\'enic and
mostly sub-critical meaning that B-fields dominate over turbulence and are
strong enough to resist gravitational collapse. The alignment and properties of
dust grains are studied in the filament using the RAdiative Torque (RAT)
theory. We find the decrease of polarization degree $P$ with emission intensity
$I$, i.e., depolarization effect, of the form $P\propto I^{-\alpha}$ with
$\alpha\sim$0.8-0.9, implying a significant loss of grain alignment in the
filament's spine. The depolarization can be explained by the decrease in RAT
alignment efficiency toward the denser regions with lower dust temperature, and
cannot be explained by the B-field tangling. We study the effect of the
enhanced magnetic relaxation by embedded iron inclusions on RAT alignment and
find that the high polarization fraction $P\sim$20-30\% in the outer layer of
the filament is potential evidence for the enhanced RAT alignment by magnetic
relaxation. This is the first time this effect is evaluated in a filament.
Based on the polarization fraction and RAT alignment theory, we find evidence
for grain growth in the filament.

The results suggest that the dynamics of the current sheet layers generates
turbulence, which in turn creates a sufficiently strong temperature anisotropy
to make the solar-wind plasma unstable to anisotropy-driven instabilities such
as the Alfv\'en ion-cyclotron, mirror-mode, and firehose instabilities. The
study of the polarization state of high-frequency magnetic fluctuations reveals
that ion cyclotron waves are indeed present along the current sheet, thus
linking the magnetic topology of the remotely imaged coronal source regions

produces a time series for each panel. These time series can be merged in a
single multivariate time series (MTS). We present in this work a new Deep
Learning model for GRBs detection in the MTSs, generated by the ACS, using an
anomaly detection technique. The model is implemented with a Deep Convolutional

approximative description of the motion of any particles at any given time,

comes from the ignorance of the exact Hamiltonian ruling the dynamic. In order
to address this problem, we formulate an inverse problem consisting in
determining the Hamiltonian of a quantum system from the knowledge of the state

where the Hamiltonian is given by $-\Delta + V$, where the potential $V =
V(\mathrm{t}, \mathrm{x})$ is non-compactly supported. Our main result is a
uniqueness theorem, which establishes that the Hamiltonian ruling the dynamic
of all quantum particles is determined by the prescription of the initial and

We present the WEBT optical data in the BVRI bands acquired at 36 observatories
around the world. In mid 2021 the source showed its historical maximum, with R
= 11.14. The light curves display many episodes of intraday variability, whose
amplitude increases with source brightness, in agreement with a geometrical
interpretation of the long-term flux behaviour. This is also supported by the
long-term spectral variability, with an almost achromatic trend with
brightness. In contrast, short-term variations are found to be strongly
chromatic and are ascribed to energetic processes in the jet. We also analyse
the optical polarimetric behaviour, finding evidence of a strong correlation
between the intrinsic fast variations in flux density and those in polarisation
degree, with a time delay of about 13 h. This suggests a common physical
origin. The overall behaviour of the source can be interpreted as the result of
two mechanisms: variability on time scales greater than several days is likely
produced by orientation effects, while either shock waves propagating in the
jet, or magnetic reconnection, possibly induced by kink instabilities in the
jet, can explain variability on shorter time scales. The latter scenario could
also account for the appearance of quasi-periodic oscillations, with periods
from a few days to a few hours, during outbursts, when the jet is more closely
aligned with our line of sight and the time scales are shortened by
relativistic effects.

efficiently joint optimization algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and
generalized benders decomposition (GBD). In particular, the long-term
optimization problem can be transformed into a primal problem and a master
problem in each time slot that is much simpler to solve. The near-optimal
clustering and caching strategy can be obtained through solving the primal and
master problem alternately. Extensive simulations show that the proposed joint
optimization algorithm outperforms other algorithms and can effectively reduce
the long-term delay by at most $93.75% and caching cost by at most $53.12%.

spin defects hosted in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a van der Waals material

boron vacancy (V$_{\rm B}^-$) defects in a powder of ultrathin hBN nanoflakes
($<10$~atomic monolayers thick on average) and measure the longitudinal spin
relaxation time ($T_1$) of this system. We then decorate the dry hBN nanopowder
with paramagnetic Gd$^{3+}$ ions and observe a clear $T_1$ quenching, under
ambient conditions, consistent with the added magnetic noise. Finally, we
demonstrate the possibility of performing spin measurements including $T_1$
relaxometry using solution-suspended hBN nanopowder. Our results highlight the
potential and versatility of the hBN quantum sensor for a range of sensing
applications, and pave the way towards the realisation of a truly 2D,

mathematical optimisation problem formulation involves a bi-level model in
which a welfare-maximizing transmission system operator makes investments in
transmission lines at the upper level while considering power market dynamics
at the lower level. To account for deregulated energy market structure, we
assume that the generation companies at the lower level make generation

Considering alternative levels for a transmission infrastructure expansion
budget, carbon emission taxes and monetary incentives for renewable generation
capacity expansion, we study how alternative compositions of these three
factors affect the share of renewable generation in the total generation mix.
We apply the proposed modelling assessment to an illustrative three-node

efficiency of three renewable-driven measures when applied individually.
Nevertheless, applied in composition, these three measures demonstrated a

advantages of employing the TMB (Kristensen et al., 2016) framework in R for
this purpose were illustrated recently Bacri et al. (2022). In this paper, we
present extensions of these results in two directions. First, we present a
practical way to obtain uncertainty estimates in form of confidence intervals

computer-intensive bootstrap methods. By means of several examples, we
illustrate patterns present for the derived CIs. Secondly, we investigate the
performance of popular optimizers available in R when estimating HMMs via DNM.
Hereby, our focus lies on the potential benefits of employing TMB. Investigated
criteria via a number of simulation studies are convergence speed, accuracy,
and the impact of (poor) initial values. Our findings suggest that all
optimizers considered benefit in terms of speed from using the gradient

Recently, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have also been incorporated into the user-item

exploited to address cold-start problems and enable more explainable
aggregation in GNN-based recommender systems (GNN-Rs). However, due to the
heterogeneous nature of users and items, developing an effective aggregation
strategy that works across multiple GNN-Rs, such as LightGCN and KGAT, remains
a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based
message passing framework for recommender systems, which we call DPAO (Dual
Policy framework for Aggregation Optimization). This framework adaptively
determines high-order connectivity to aggregate users and items using dual
policy learning. Dual policy learning leverages two Deep-Q-Network models to
exploit the user- and item-aware feedback from a GNN-R and boost the
performance of the target GNN-R. Our proposed framework was evaluated with both

axions when they are immersed in a strong static magnetic field. In order to
increase the volume and improve its introduction within dipole or solenoid
magnets for axion searches, various haloscope design techniques for rectangular
geometries are discussed in this study. The volume limits of two types of
haloscopes are explored: based on single cavities and based on multicavities.
For both cases, possibilities for increasing the volume in long and/or tall
structures are presented. For multicavities, 1D geometries are explored to
optimize the space in the magnets. Also, 2D and 3D geometries are introduced as
a first step for laying the foundations for the development of these kind of
topologies. The results prove the usefulness of the developed methods,
evidencing the ample room of improvement in rectangular haloscope designs
nowadays. A factor of three orders of magnitude improvement in volume compared
with a single cavity based on WR-90 standard waveguide is obtained with the
design of a long and tall single cavity. Similar procedures have been applied
for long and tall multicavities. Experimental measurements are shown for
prototypes based on tall multicavities and 2D structures, demonstrating the
feasibility of using these types of geometries to increase the volume in real
haloscopes.

semantics of two text sentences are consistent with each other. However, the
existing methods usually encounter the challenges of synonyms, polysemy and
difficulty to understand long text. To solve the above problems, this paper
proposes a co-driven semantic consistency recognition method based on the
fusion of Transformer and HowNet sememes knowledge. Multi-level encoding of
internal sentence structures via data-driven is carried out firstly by
Transformer, sememes knowledge base HowNet is introduced for knowledge-driven
to model the semantic knowledge association among sentence pairs. Then,
interactive attention calculation is carried out utilizing soft-attention and
fusion the knowledge with sememes matrix. Finally, bidirectional long
short-term memory network (BiLSTM) is exploited to encode the conceptual
semantic information and infer the semantic consistency. Experiments are
conducted on two financial text matching datasets (BQ, AFQMC) and a
cross-lingual adversarial dataset (PAWSX) for paraphrase identification.
Compared with lightweight models including DSSM, MwAN, DRCN, and pre-training
models such as ERNIE etc., the proposed model can not only improve the accuracy
of semantic consistency recognition effectively (by 2.19%, 5.57% and 6.51%
compared with the DSSM, MWAN and DRCN models on the BQ dataset), but also
reduce the number of model parameters (to about 16M). In addition, driven by
the HowNet sememes knowledge, the proposed method is promising to adapt to
scenarios with long text.

To this end, we present a novel multi-task framework (i.e., MulGT) for WSI

Knowledge Injection and Domain Knowledge-driven Graph Pooling modules.
Basically, with the Graph Neural Network and Transformer as the building

learn more accurate representation for different tasks. Further, we elaborately
design a novel Domain Knowledge-driven Graph Pooling module for each task to
improve both the accuracy and robustness of different tasks by leveraging
different diagnosis patterns of multiple tasks. We evaluated our method on two

game is played on a connected graph in which two players, one controlling a

classification is not to guess a class, but to choose the optimal course of
action among a set of possible ones, usually not in one-one correspondence with
the set of classes. This decision-theoretic problem requires sensible
probabilities for the classes. Probabilities conditional on the features are
computationally almost impossible to find in many important cases. The main
idea of the present work is to calculate probabilities conditional not on the
features, but on the trained classifier's output. This calculation is cheap,
needs to be made only once, and provides an output-to-probability ""transducer""
that can be applied to all future outputs of the classifier. In conjunction
with problem-dependent utilities, the probabilities of the transducer allow us
to find the optimal choice among the classes or among a set of more general
decisions, by means of expected-utility maximization. This idea is demonstrated
in a simplified drug-discovery problem with a highly imbalanced dataset. The
transducer and utility maximization together always lead to improved results,
sometimes close to theoretical maximum, for all sets of problem-dependent
utilities. The one-time-only calculation of the transducer also provides,
automatically: (i) a quantification of the uncertainty about the transducer
itself; (ii) the expected utility of the augmented algorithm (including its
uncertainty), which can be used for algorithm selection; (iii) the possibility
of using the algorithm in a ""generative mode"", useful if the training dataset
is biased.

integral approach. Despite the effectiveness of this duality, there is no
corresponding, mathematically rigorous proof of such correspondence. We address
this issue using techniques proper of the algebraic approach to quantum field
theories which is known to provide a valuable framework to discuss rigorously
the path integral formulation of field theories as well as the solution theory
both of ordinary and of partial, stochastic differential equations. In

analysis that has been effective in the safety analysis of systems across
industrial sectors from transportation, energy, to national defence. The
unstoppable trend of using Machine Learning (ML) in safety-critical systems has
led to the pressing need of extending STPA to Learning-Enabled Systems (LESs).
However, while work has been carried out over different example systems,
without a systematic review, it is unclear how effective and generalisable the
extended STPA methods are and, more importantly, if further improvements can be
made. To this end, we present our survey on 29 papers selected through a
systematic literature search. We summarise and compare relevant research from
five perspectives (attributes of concern, object under study, modifications to
STPA, derivatives of the analysis, and process modelled as a control loop) to
conclude insights. Furthermore, based on the survey results, we identify room
for improvement and accordingly introduce a new method named DeepSTPA, which
enhances STPA from two aspects that are missing from the state-of-the-art: (i)
it explicitly models how the control loop structures are extended to identify
hazards from the data-driven development process at every stage of the ML
lifecycle; (ii) it models fine-grained functionalities deep into the
layer-levels of ML models to detect root causes. We demonstrate DeepSTPA
through a case study on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).

  Helmert's Point Error",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ego-localization is a crucial task for autonomous vehicles. On the one hand,
it needs to be very accurate, and on the other hand, very robust to provide
reliable pose (position and orientation) information, even in challenging
environments. Finding the best ego-position is usually tied to optimizing an
objective function based on the sensor measurements. The most common approach
is to maximize the likelihood, which leads under the assumption of normally
distributed random variables to the well-known least squares minimization,
often used in conjunction with recursive estimation, e. g. using a Kalman
filter. However, least squares minimization is inherently sensitive to
outliers, and consequently, more robust loss functions, such as L1 norm or
Huber loss have been proposed. Arguably the most robust loss function is the
outlier count, also known as maximum consensus optimization, where the outcome
is independent of the outlier magnitude. In this paper, we investigate in
detail the performance of maximum consensus localization based on LiDAR data.
We elaborate on its shortcomings and propose a novel objective function based
on Helmert's point error. In an experiment using 3001 measurement epochs, we
show that the maximum consensus localization based on the introduced objective
function provides superior results with respect to robustness.

  geometrical and topological aspects","41 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cond-mat.str-el","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  On performing a sequence of renormalisation group (RG) transformations on a
system of two-dimensional non-interacting Dirac fermions placed on a torus, we
demonstrate the emergence of an additional spatial dimension arising out of the
scaling of multipartite entanglement. The renormalisation of entanglement under
this flow exhibits a hierarchy across scales as well as number of parties.
Geometric measures defined in this emergent space, such as distances and
curvature, can be related to the RG beta function of the coupling $g$
responsible for the spectral gap. This establishes a holographic connection
between the spatial geometry of the emergent space in the bulk and the
entanglement properties of the quantum theory lying on its boundary. Depending
on the anomalous dimension of the coupling $g$, three classes of spaces
(bounded, unbounded and flat) are generated from the RG. We show that changing
from one class to another involves a topological transition. By minimising the
central charge of the conformal field theory describing the noninteracting
electrons under the RG flow, the RG transformations are shown to satisfy the
$c-$theorem of Zamolodchikov. This is shown to possess a dual within the
emergent geometric space, in the form of a convergence parameter that is
minimised at large distances. In the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm flux, the
entanglement gains a geometry-independent piece which is shown to be
topological, sensitive to changes in boundary conditions, and can be related to
the Luttinger volume of the system of electrons. In the presence of a strong
transverse magnetic field, the system becomes insulating and Luttinger's
theorem does not hold. We show instead that the entanglement contains a term
that can be related to the Chern numbers of the quantum Hall states. This
yields a relation between the topological invariants of the metallic and the
quantum Hall systems.

observed gamma-ray spectrum from a number of remnants strongly resembles the
expected spectrum of the gamma-ray emission from the compressed population of
Galactic cosmic rays. In the following we discuss the feasibility of this

sufficient amount of gamma-rays and that the observed spectral shape is putting
strong limits on the allowed compression factors. Further, absence of curvature
in featureless power-law spectra of evolved supernova remnants at radio

  A Case Study on the Chromium CI",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flaky tests are tests that pass and fail on different executions of the same
version of a program under test. They waste valuable developer time by making
developers investigate false alerts (flaky test failures). To deal with this
problem, many prediction methods that identify flaky tests have been proposed.
While promising, the actual utility of these methods remains unclear since they
have not been evaluated within a continuous integration (CI) process. In
particular, it remains unclear what is the impact of missed faults, i.e., the
consideration of fault-triggering test failures as flaky, at different CI
cycles. To fill this gap, we apply state-of-the-art flakiness prediction
methods at the Chromium CI and check their performance. Perhaps surprisingly,
we find that, despite the high precision (99.2%) of the methods, their
application leads to numerous faults missed, approximately 76.2% of all
regression faults. To explain this result, we analyse the fault-triggering
failures and show that flaky tests have a strong fault-revealing capability,
i.e., they reveal more than 1/3 of all regression faults, indicating an
inherent limitation of all methods focusing on identifying flaky tests, instead
of flaky test failures. Going a step further, we build failure-focused
prediction methods and optimize them by considering new features.
Interestingly, we find that these methods perform better than the test-focused
ones, with an MCC increasing from 0.20 to 0.42. Overall, our findings imply
that on the one hand future research should focus on predicting flaky test
failures instead of flaky tests and the need for adopting more thorough
experimental methodologies when evaluating flakiness prediction methods, on the
other.

paired against each other. An intentional early loss therefore might lead to
weaker opponents in later rounds and thus to a better final tournament result -
a phenomenon known as the Swiss Gambit. To the best of our knowledge it is an
open question whether this strategy can actually work.
  This paper provides answers based on an empirical agent-based analysis for
the most prominent application area of the Swiss-system format, namely chess
tournaments. We simulate realistic tournaments by employing the official FIDE
pairing system for computing the player pairings in each round. We show that
even though gambits are widely possible in Swiss-system chess tournaments,
profiting from them requires a high degree of predictability of match results.
Moreover, even if a Swiss Gambit succeeds, the obtained improvement in the
final ranking is limited. Our experiments prove that counting on a Swiss Gambit
is indeed a lot more of a risky gambit than a reliable strategy to improve the
final rank.

observations taken by EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode. However,
the suitability of coronal magnetic field measurements based on the weak and
strong magnetic field techniques has not been evaluated. Besides, temperature
diagnostics is also important for measuring coronal magnetic field based on the
MIT theory, but how to determine the accurate formation temperature of the Fe X
lines from EIS observations still needs investigation. In this study, we
synthesized emissions of several spectral lines from a 3D radiation
magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar active region, and then derived magnetic
field strengths using different methods. We first compared the magnetic field
strengths derived from the weak and strong magnetic field techniques to the
values in the model. Our study suggests that both weak and strong magnetic
field techniques underestimate the coronal magnetic field strength. Then we
developed two methods to calculate the formation temperature of the Fe X lines.
One is based on differential emission measure analyses, and the other is
deriving temperature from the Fe IX and Fe XI line pairs. However, neither of
the two methods can provide temperature determination for accurate coronal
magnetic field measurements as those derived from the Fe X 174/175 and 184/345

inward compared to N+ and Ne+ that has been verified from the analytical

confirmed using cross-correlation techniques. The inward transport or negative
flux of the impurity ions is found directly associated with the monopolar
density holes in the presence of the electron temperature gradient whereas the
outward transport is associated with the plasma blobs. The inward impurity
transport has been analyzed using hole fraction analysis. ~44% of Ar+, ~28% of

is a set $I$ of items, sizes $s:I \rightarrow [0,1]$, and a conflict graph $G =

independent sets, each of total size at most $1$. Being a generalization of the
notoriously hard graph coloring problem, BPC has been studied mostly on
polynomially colorable conflict graphs. An intriguing open question is whether
BPC on such graphs admits the same best known approximation guarantees as
classic bin packing.
  We answer this question negatively, by showing that (in contrast to bin
packing) there is no asymptotic polynomial-time approximation scheme (APTAS)
for BPC already on seemingly easy graph classes, such as bipartite and split
graphs. We complement this result with improved approximation guarantees for
BPC on several prominent graph classes. Most notably, we derive an asymptotic
$1.391$-approximation for bipartite graphs, a $2.445$-approximation for perfect

this end, we introduce a generic framework relying on a novel interpretation of

$\sim 140$ pc. We study the luminosity and size distribution functions (LDFs

is $1.79\pm 0.09$, while the average SDF slope is $3.1\pm 0.5$. Results suggest
the star formation to be turbulence driven and scale-free, as in main-sequence

an enhanced H$\alpha$ luminosity at a given size, compared to the clumps in
main-sequence galaxies. Indeed, their H$\alpha$ luminosity is closer to that of

effective theory is constructed at the Hamiltonian level by introducing certain
correction terms under the condition that the modified constraints form a
closed algebra. The corresponding metric tensor is then carefully constructed
ensuring that the covariance of the theory is respected, that is, in such a way
that different gauge choices on phase space simply correspond to different
charts of the same spacetime solution. The resulting geometry is characterized
by four parameters: the three usual ones that appear in the general
relativistic limit (describing the mass, the charge, and the cosmological
constant), as well as a polymerization parameter, which encodes the
quantum-gravity corrections. Contrary to general relativity, where this family
of solutions is generically singular, in this effective model the presence of
the singularity depends on the values of the parameters. The specific ranges of
values that define the family of singularity-free spacetimes are explicitly
found, and their global structure is analyzed. In particular, the mass and the
cosmological constant need to be nonnegative to provide a nonsingular geometry,
while there can only be a bounded, relatively small, amount of charge. These
conditions are suited for any known spherical astrophysical black hole in the
de Sitter cosmological background, and thus this model provides a globally
regular description for them.

theoretical studies have shown that astrophysical environments could mislead
the spatial localization by distorting the GW signals. It is unclear whether
and to what degree the incorrect spatial localizations of dark sirens would
impair the accuracy of the measurement of the cosmological parameters. To
address this issue, we consider the future observations of dark sirens using
the Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, and we design a Bayesian
framework to access the precision of measuring the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant

extreme scenario that all the dark sirens are localized incorrectly. As the
number exceeds $300$, the incorrect spatial localizations start to produce
statistically noticeable effects, such as a slow convergence of the posterior
distribution of $H_0$. We propose several tests that can be used in future
observations to verify the spatial localizations of dark sirens. Simulations of
these tests suggest that incorrect spatial localizations will dominate a
systematic error of $H_0$ if as much as $10\%$ of a sample of $300$

randomised controlled trial. However, even when randomised controlled trials
can be performed, they usually have relatively short duration's due to cost
considerations. This makes learning long-term causal effects a very challenging
task in practice, since the long-term outcome is only observed after a long
delay. In this paper, we study the identification and estimation of long-term
treatment effects when both experimental and observational data are available.
Previous work provided an estimation strategy to determine long-term causal
effects from such data regimes. However, this strategy only works if one
assumes there are no unobserved confounders in the observational data. In this
paper, we specifically address the challenging case where unmeasured
confounders are present in the observational data. Our long-term causal effect
estimator is obtained by combining regression residuals with short-term
experimental outcomes in a specific manner to create an instrumental variable,
which is then used to quantify the long-term causal effect through instrumental
variable regression. We prove this estimator is unbiased, and analytically
study its variance. In the context of the front-door causal structure, this
provides a new causal estimator, which may be of independent interest. Finally,
we empirically test our approach on synthetic-data, as well as real-data from

Neighbor Search, simply P2HNNS) is a new and challenging problem with
applications in many research domains. While existing state-of-the-art hashing
schemes (e.g., NH and FH) are able to achieve sublinear time complexity without
the assumption of the data being in a unit hypersphere, they require an
asymmetric transformation, which increases the data dimension from $d$ to
$\Omega(d^2)$. This leads to considerable overhead for indexing and incurs
significant distortion errors.
  In this paper, we investigate a tree-based approach for solving P2HNNS using
the classical Ball-Tree index. Compared to hashing-based methods, tree-based
methods usually require roughly linear costs for construction, and they provide
different kinds of approximations with excellent flexibility. A simple
branch-and-bound algorithm with a novel lower bound is first developed on
Ball-Tree for performing P2HNNS. Then, a new tree structure named BC-Tree,
which maintains the Ball and Cone structures in the leaf nodes of Ball-Tree, is
described together with two effective strategies, i.e., point-level pruning and
collaborative inner product computing. BC-Tree inherits both the low
construction cost and lightweight property of Ball-Tree while providing a
similar or more efficient search. Experimental results over 16 real-world data
sets show that Ball-Tree and BC-Tree are around 1.1$\sim$10$\times$ faster than
NH and FH, and they can reduce the index size and indexing time by about
1$\sim$3 orders of magnitudes on average. The code is available at

various deep learning methods were developed in this context, typically they
perform denoising due to low-dose and deblurring for super-resolution
separately. Up to date, little work was done for simultaneous in-plane
denoising and through-plane deblurring, which is important to improve clinical
CT images. For this task, a straightforward method is to directly train an
end-to-end 3D network. However, it demands much more training data and
expensive computational costs. Here, we propose to link in-plane and
through-plane transformers for simultaneous in-plane denoising and
through-plane deblurring, termed as LIT-Former, which can efficiently synergize
in-plane and through-plane sub-tasks for 3D CT imaging and enjoy the advantages
of both convolution and transformer networks. LIT-Former has two novel designs:
efficient multi-head self-attention modules (eMSM) and efficient convolutional
feed-forward networks (eCFN). First, eMSM integrates in-plane 2D self-attention
and through-plane 1D self-attention to efficiently capture global interactions
of 3D self-attention, the core unit of transformer networks. Second, eCFN
integrates 2D convolution and 1D convolution to extract local information of 3D
convolution in the same fashion. As a result, the proposed LIT-Former
synergizes these two sub-tasks, significantly reducing the computational
complexity as compared to 3D counterparts and enabling rapid convergence.
Extensive experimental results on simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate
superior performance over state-of-the-art models.

cutting-edge technologies like drug discovery in life sciences. However,
challenges around data isolation and privacy threaten the trustworthiness of FL
systems. Adversarial attacks against data privacy, learning algorithm
stability, and system confidentiality are particularly concerning in the
context of distributed training in federated learning. Therefore, it is crucial
to develop FL in a trustworthy manner, with a focus on security, robustness,

trustworthy FL systems and summarize existing efforts from three key aspects:
security, robustness, and privacy. We outline the threats that pose
vulnerabilities to trustworthy federated learning across different stages of
development, including data processing, model training, and deployment. To
guide the selection of the most appropriate defense methods, we discuss
specific technical solutions for realizing each aspect of Trustworthy FL (TFL).
Our approach differs from previous work that primarily discusses TFL from a

network that can predict a posterior probability of winning a game at any given
phase of the game and given a candidate for the next action. We then developed
an AI agent that can interact with humans and choose the best voting target on
the basis of its probability from the value network. Lastly, we evaluated the
performance of the agent by having it actually play the game with human
players. We found that our AI agent, Deep Wolf, could play Werewolf as
competitively as average human players in a villager or a betrayer role,
whereas Deep Wolf was inferior to human players in a werewolf or a seer role.
These results suggest that current language models have the capability to
suspect what others are saying, tell a lie, or detect lies in conversations.

physics and dynamics of the corona, has only rarely been measured. Here, the
electron density maps derived from images acquired during the total solar
eclipse of August 21st, 2017 are employed to demonstrate a new technique to
measure the coronal magnetic fields. The strength of the coronal magnetic
fields is derived with a semiempirical formula relating the plasma magnetic
energy density to the gravitational potential energy. The resulting values are
compared with those provided by more advanced coronal field reconstruction
methods based on MHD simulations of the whole corona starting from photospheric
field measurements, finding a very good agreement. Other parameters such as the
plasma-$\beta$ and Alfv\'en velocity are also derived and compared with those
of MHD simulations. Moreover, the plane-of-sky (POS) orientation of the coronal
magnetic fields is derived from the observed inclination of the coronal
features in the filtered images, also finding a close agreement with magnetic
field reconstructions. Hence, this work demonstrates for the first time that
the 2D distribution of coronal electron densities measured during total solar
eclipses is sufficient to provide the coronal magnetic field strengths and
inclinations projected on the POS. These are among the main missing pieces of
information that limited so far our understanding of physical phenomena going
on in the solar corona.

health risk from waterborne pathogens, although quantifying the concentrations
of microbiological organisms in water is still challenging because
concentrations of many pathogens in water samples may often be below the
quantification limit, producing censoring data. To enable statistical analysis
based on quantitative values, the true values of non-detected measurements are
required to be estimated with high precision. Tobit model is a well-known
linear regression model for analyzing censored data. One drawback of the Tobit
model is that only the target variable is allowed to be censored. In this
study, we devised a novel extension of the classical Tobit model, called the
\emph{multi-target Tobit model}, to handle multiple censored variables
simultaneously by introducing multiple target variables. For fitting the new
model, a numerical stable optimization algorithm was developed based on
elaborate theories. Experiments conducted using several real-world water
quality datasets provided an evidence that estimating multiple columns jointly
gains a great advantage over estimating them separately.

pulsars presents a problem, given that these systems are older than the spin-up

equilibrium balanced by the torque due to gravitational wave emission. We note
that field lines penetrating the disc beyond the inner radius reduce the
maximum rotation frequency of the star, a result well-known since the seminal
work of Ghosh & Lamb. We show that the polar cap area corresponds to about half
the neutron star surface area at the cut-off frequency if the inner radius is
slightly smaller than the corotation radius. We then include the change in the
moment of inertia of the star due to the accretion of mass and find that this
effect further reduces the maximum rotation frequency of the star. Finally, we
include the torque due to gravitational wave emission and calculate its
contribution to the torque equilibrium. Our results suggest that all three
processes are significant at the cut-off frequency, and all of them must be
considered in addressing the absence of millisecond pulsars.

stability, leading to the possibility of skyrmion-based devices for room
temperature applications. At the same time, the search for additional stable
topological spin textures has been under intense research focus. Besides their
fundamental importance, such textures may expand the information encoding
capability of spintronic devices. However, fractional spin texture states
within MMLs in the vertical dimension have yet to be investigated. In this
work, we demonstrate numerically fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) in a tailored
MML system. We subsequently propose to encode sequences of information signals
with fractional skyrmion tubes (FSTs) as information bits in a tailored MML
device. Micromagnetic simulations and theoretical calculations are used to
verify the feasibility of hosting distinct FST states within a single device,
and their thermal stability is investigated. A multilayer multiplexing device
is proposed, where multiple sequences of the information signals can be encoded
and transmitted based on the nucleation and propagation of packets of FSTs.
Finally, pipelined information transmission and automatic demultiplexing is
demonstrated by exploiting the skyrmion Hall effect and introducing
voltage-controlled synchronizers and width-based track selectors. The findings
indicate that FSTs can be potential candidates as information carriers for
future spintronic applications.

from an unbalanced beam splitter ratio and optical losses. We perform a

and chirality selective magnon-phonon hybridization in the atomically thin 2D
antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator FePSe3. With a combination of
magneto-infrared and magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe chiral magnon
polarons (chiMP), the new hybridized quasiparticles, at zero magnetic field.
The hybridization gap reaches 0.25~meV and survives down to the quadrilayer

AFM magnons and chiral phonons with parallel angular momenta, which arises from
the underlying phonon and space group symmetries. This coupling lifts the
chiral phonon degeneracy and gives rise to an unusual Raman circular
polarization of the chiMP branches. The observation of coherent chiral
spin-lattice excitations in the atomic limit and at zero magnetic field paves
the way for the angular momentum-based hybrid phononic and magnonic devices.

us to implement protocols which are device-independent, i.e. they can be proven
security under fewer assumptions. These protocols rely on using devices
producing non-local statistics and ideally these statistics would correspond to
extremal points of the quantum set in the probability space. However, even in
the CHSH scenario (the simplest non-trivial Bell scenario) we do not have a
full understanding of the extremal quantum points. In fact, there are only a
couple of analytic families of such points. Our first contribution is to
introduce two new families of analytical quantum extremal points by providing
solutions to two new families of Bell functionals. In the second part we focus
on developing an analytical criteria for extremality in the CHSH scenario. A
well-known Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes criterion only applies to points with
uniform marginals, but a generalisation has been suggested in a sequence of

on a 17.5-day orbit (TOI-1055 b). Radial velocity (RV) analyses carried out by
two independent groups using nearly the same set of HARPS spectra have provided
measurements of planetary masses that differ by $\sim$ 2$\sigma$. Our aim in
this work is to solve the inconsistency in the published planetary masses by
significantly extending the set of HARPS RV measurements and employing a new
analysis tool that is able to account and correct for stellar activity. Our
further aim was to improve the precision on measurements of the planetary
radius by observing two transits of the planet with the CHEOPS space telescope.
We fit a skew normal (SN) function to each cross correlation function extracted
from the HARPS spectra to obtain RV measurements and hyperparameters to be used
for the detrending. We evaluated the correlation changes of the hyperparameters
along the RV time series using the breakpoint technique. We performed a joint
photometric and RV analysis using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) scheme to
simultaneously detrend the light curves and the RV time series. We firmly
detected the Keplerian signal of TOI-1055 b, deriving a planetary mass of
$M_b=20.4_{-2.5}^{+2.6} M_{\oplus}$ ($\sim$12%). This value is in agreement
with one of the two estimates in the literature, but it is significantly more
precise. Thanks to the TESS transit light curves combined with exquisite CHEOPS
photometry, we also derived a planetary radius of $R_b=3.490_{-0.064}^{+0.070}
R_{\oplus}$ ($\sim$1.9%). Our mass and radius measurements imply a mean density
of $\rho_b=2.65_{-0.35}^{+0.37}$ g cm$^{-3}$ ($\sim$14%). We further inferred
the planetary structure and found that TOI-1055 b is very likely to host a

  systems","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted millimeter wave (mmWave) systems,
channel state information (CSI) feedback is critical for the selection of
modulation schemes, resource management, beamforming, etc. However, traditional
CSI feedback methods lead to significant feedback overhead and energy
consumption of the UAV transmitter, therefore shortening the system operation
time. To tackle these issues, inspired by superimposed feedback and integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC), a line of sight (LoS) sensing-based
superimposed CSI feedback scheme is proposed. Specifically, on the UAV
transmitter side, the ground-to-UAV (G2U) CSI is superimposed on the
UAVto-ground (U2G) data to feed back to the ground base station (gBS). At the
gBS, the dedicated LoS sensing network (LoSSenNet) is designed to sense the U2G
CSI in LoS and NLoS scenarios. With the sensed result of LoS-SenNet, the
determined G2U CSI from the initial feature extraction will work as the priori
information to guide the subsequent operation. Specifically, for the G2U CSI in
NLoS, a CSI recovery network (CSI-RecNet) and superimposed interference
cancellation are developed to recover the G2U CSI and U2G data. As for the LoS
scenario, a dedicated LoS aid network (LoS-AidNet) is embedded before the
CSI-RecNet and the block of superimposed interference cancellation to highlight
the feature of the G2U CSI. Compared with other methods of superimposed CSI
feedback, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed feedback scheme
effectively improves the recovery accuracy of the G2U CSI and U2G data.
Besides, against parameter variations, the proposed feedback scheme presents
its robustness.

called modules. We investigate the synthesis of supervisory controllers for
modular systems under partial observation that, as the closed-loop system,
realize the supremal normal sublanguage of the specification. We call such
controllers maximally permissive normal supervisors. The challenge in modular
systems is to find conditions under which the global nonblocking and maximally
permissive normal supervisor can be achieved locally as the parallel
composition of local normal supervisors. We show that a structural concept of
hierarchical supervisory control called modified observation consistency (MOC)
is such a condition. However, the algorithmic verification of MOC is an open
problem, and therefore it is necessary to find easily-verifiable conditions
that ensure MOC. We show that the condition that all shared events are
observable is such a condition. Considering specifications, we examine both
local specifications, where each module has its own specification, and global
specifications. We combine our results for normality with the existing results
for controllability to locally synthesize the nonblocking and maximally
permissive controllable and normal supervisor. Finally, we illustrate the
results on an industrial case study of the patient table of an MRI scanner.

this setting, the \emph{diameter} $D$ of the MDP is $\Omega(S^S)$, where $S$ is
the number of states. Therefore, the existing lower and upper bounds on the
regret at time$T$, of order $O(\sqrt{DSAT})$ for MDPs with $S$ states and $A$
actions, may suggest that reinforcement learning is inefficient here. In our
main result however, we exploit the structure of our MDPs to show that the
regret of a slightly-tweaked version of the classical learning algorithm {\sc
Ucrl2} is in fact upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{E_2AT})$ where
$E_2$ is related to the weighted second moment of the stationary measure of a

long-standing and highly challenging problem in computer vision. In this paper,
we propose a novel method for single-image 3D reconstruction which generates a
sparse point cloud via a conditional denoising diffusion process. Our method
takes as input a single RGB image along with its camera pose and gradually
denoises a set of 3D points, whose positions are initially sampled randomly
from a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution, into the shape of an object.
The key to our method is a geometrically-consistent conditioning process which
we call projection conditioning: at each step in the diffusion process, we
project local image features onto the partially-denoised point cloud from the
given camera pose. This projection conditioning process enables us to generate
high-resolution sparse geometries that are well-aligned with the input image,
and can additionally be used to predict point colors after shape
reconstruction. Moreover, due to the probabilistic nature of the diffusion
process, our method is naturally capable of generating multiple different
shapes consistent with a single input image. In contrast to prior work, our
approach not only performs well on synthetic benchmarks, but also gives large
qualitative improvements on complex real-world data.

the so-called distribution semantics. However, the distribution semantics is

hybrid PLP language DC-ProbLog and its inference engine infinitesimal algebraic

distinctive characteristics of low power consumption and temporal information

applying SNNs, can ensure that converted SNNs achieve comparable performance to
ANNs on large-scale datasets. However, the performance degrades severely under
low quantities of time-steps, which hampers the practical applications of SNNs
to neuromorphic chips. In this paper, instead of evaluating different
conversion errors and then eliminating these errors, we define an offset spike
to measure the degree of deviation between actual and desired SNN firing rates.
We perform a detailed analysis of offset spike and note that the firing of one
additional (or one less) spike is the main cause of conversion errors. Based on
this, we propose an optimization strategy based on shifting the initial
membrane potential and we theoretically prove the corresponding optimal
shifting distance for calibrating the spike. In addition, we also note that our

white-box scenarios. When applying the adversarial voices that are generated by
attacking white-box surrogate models to black-box victim models, i.e.
\textit{transfer-based} black-box attacks, the transferability of the
adversarial voices is not only far from satisfactory, but also lacks
interpretable basis. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
general framework, named spectral transformation attack based on modified
discrete cosine transform (STA-MDCT), to improve the transferability of the
adversarial voices to a black-box victim model. Specifically, we first apply
MDCT to the input voice. Then, we slightly modify the energy of different
frequency bands for capturing the salient regions of the adversarial noise in
the time-frequency domain that are critical to a successful attack. Unlike
existing approaches that operate voices in the time domain, the proposed
framework operates voices in the time-frequency domain, which improves the
interpretability, transferability, and imperceptibility of the attack.
Moreover, it can be implemented with any gradient-based attackers. To utilize
the advantage of model ensembling, we not only implement STA-MDCT with a single
white-box surrogate model, but also with an ensemble of surrogate models.
Finally, we visualize the saliency maps of adversarial voices by the class
activation maps (CAM), which offers an interpretable basis to transfer-based
attacks in speaker recognition for the first time. Extensive comparison results
with five representative attackers show that the CAM visualization clearly
explains the effectiveness of STA-MDCT, and the weaknesses of the comparison
methods; the proposed method outperforms the comparison methods by a large
margin.

of the most popular methods for detecting differences between two distributions
over general metric spaces. In this paper we propose a method to boost the
power of the kernel test by combining MMD estimates over multiple kernels using
their Mahalanobis distance. We derive the asymptotic null distribution of the
proposed test statistic and use a multiplier bootstrap approach to efficiently
compute the rejection region. The resulting test is universally consistent and,
since it is obtained by aggregating over a collection of kernels/bandwidths, is
more powerful in detecting a wide range of alternatives in finite samples. We
also derive the distribution of the test statistic for both fixed and local
contiguous alternatives. The latter, in particular, implies that the proposed
test is statistically efficient, that is, it has non-trivial asymptotic
(Pitman) efficiency. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on both
synthetic and real-world datasets to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed
method over single kernel tests. Our asymptotic results rely on deriving the
joint distribution of MMD estimates using the framework of multiple stochastic
integrals, which is more broadly useful, specifically, in understanding the
efficiency properties of recently proposed adaptive MMD tests based on kernel
aggregation.

learning. Current approaches to this issue consist in learning general
representations from huge amounts of data before fine-tuning the model on a
small dataset of interest. While such technique, coined transfer learning, is
very effective in domains such as computer vision or natural langage
processing, it does not yet solve common problems of deep learning such as
model interpretability or the overall need for data. This thesis explores a
different answer to the problem of learning expressive models in data
constrained settings: instead of relying on big datasets to learn neural
networks, we will replace some modules by known functions reflecting the
structure of the data. Very often, these functions will be drawn from the rich
literature of kernel methods. Indeed, many kernels can reflect the underlying
structure of the data, thus sparing learning parameters to some extent. Our
approach falls under the hood of ""inductive biases"", which can be defined as
hypothesis on the data at hand restricting the space of models to explore
during learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in the
context of sequences, such as sentences in natural language or protein
sequences, and graphs, such as molecules. We also highlight the relationship
between our work and recent advances in deep learning. Additionally, we study
convex machine learning models. Here, rather than proposing new models, we
wonder which proportion of the samples in a dataset is really needed to learn a
""good"" model. More precisely, we study the problem of safe sample screening,
i.e, executing simple tests to discard uninformative samples from a dataset
even before fitting a machine learning model, without affecting the optimal
model. Such techniques can be used to prune datasets or mine for rare samples.

affordance from a single-frame point cloud, control the robot to actively
interact with the object with a one-step action, and capture another point
cloud. Further, the physics model is constructed from the two point clouds.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves about 70% manipulations

true method of probing the large scale structure of the Universe, as most radio

are expected to trace the cosmic radio dipole, an anisotropy analogous to the
dipole seen in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Results have shown that
although the cosmic radio dipole matches the direction of the CMB dipole, it
has a significantly larger amplitude. This result challenges our assumption of
the Universe being isotropic, which can have large repercussions for the
current cosmological paradigm. Though significant measurements have been made,
sensitivity to the radio dipole is generally hampered by systematic effects
that can cause large biases in the measurement. Here we assess these
systematics with data from the MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey (MALS). We
present the analysis of ten MALS pointings, focusing on systematic effects that
could lead to an inhomogeneous catalogue. We describe the calibration and
creation of full band continuum images and catalogues, producing a combined
catalogue containing 16,313 sources and covering 37.5 square degrees of sky
down to a sensitivity of 10 $\mu$Jy/beam. We measure the completeness, purity,
and flux recovery statistics for these catalogues using simulated data. We
investigate different source populations in the catalogues by looking at flux
densities and spectral indices, and how they might influence source counts.
Using the noise characteristics of the pointings, we find global measures that
can be used to correct for the incompleteness of the catalogue, producing
corrected number counts down to 100 - 200 $\mu$Jy. We show that we can
homogenise the catalogues and properly account for systematic effects. We
determine that we can measure the dipole to $3\sigma$ significance with 100
MALS pointings.

small-scale SOD training data. Due to the limited information provided by the

compatible with the fabrication steps of conventional CPW airbridges and
crossovers and increases device yield by allowing compensation of design and
fabrication uncertainty with $100~\mathrm{MHz}$ range and $10~\mathrm{MHz}$
resolution. We showcase two applications in circuit QED. The first is
elimination of frequency crowding between resonators intended to readout
different transmons by frequency-division multiplexing. The second is frequency
matching of readout and Purcell-filter resonator pairs. Combining this matching
with transmon frequency trimming by laser annealing reliably achieves fast and
high-fidelity readout across 17-transmon quantum processors.

demonstrate state-of-the-art results on regression and classification tasks
with tabular data, often outperforming deep neural networks. However, these
models do not provide well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, which prevents
their use for decision making in high-risk applications. The Bayesian treatment
is known to improve predictive uncertainty calibration, but previously proposed
Bayesian GBM methods are either computationally expensive, or resort to crude
approximations. Variational inference is often used to implement Bayesian
neural networks, but is difficult to apply to GBMs, because the decision trees
used as weak learners are non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose to
implement Bayesian GBMs using variational inference with soft decision trees, a
fully differentiable alternative to standard decision trees introduced by Irsoy
et al. Our experiments demonstrate that variational soft trees and variational
soft GBMs provide useful uncertainty estimates, while retaining good predictive
performance. The proposed models show higher test likelihoods when compared to
the state-of-the-art Bayesian GBMs in 7/10 tabular regression datasets and
improved out-of-distribution detection in 5/10 datasets.

in-situ, the evolution of $\sim 1800$ grains in a single phase low carbon
ferritic steel sample during uniaxial deformation. The distribution of initial
residual grain stresses in the material was observed to prevail as plasticity
builds, though became less pronounced, and therefore less influential as strain
increased. The initial Schmid factor of a grain was found to be strongly
correlated to the intergranular stress change and the range of stresses that
are permissible; a grain well aligned for easy slip is more likely to exhibit a
range of stresses than those orientated poorly for dislocation motion. The
orientation path of a grain, however, is not only dependent on its initial
orientation, but hypothesised to be influenced by its stress state and the
stress state of its grain environment. A grain neighbourhood effect is
observed: the Schmid factor of serial adjoining grains influences the stress
state of a grain of interest, whereas parallel neighbours are much less
influential. This phenomenon is strongest at low plastic strains only, with the
effect diminishing as plasticity builds. The influence of initial residual
stresses becomes less evident, and grains rotate to eliminate any orientation
dependent load shedding. The ability of the BCC ferrite to exhaust such
neighbourhood interactions, which would otherwise be detrimental in crystal
structures with lower symmetric and fewer slip systems, is considered key to
the high ductility possessed by these materials.

Insight-HXMT mission and consists of 96 Swept Charge Devices (SCD) covering the
1-10 keV energy band. The energy gain and resolution are continuously
calibrated by analysing Cassiopeia A (Cas A) and blank sky data, while the
effective areas are also calibrated with the observations of the Crab Nebula.
In this paper, we present the evolution of the in-orbit performances of LE in
the first 5 years since launch. Methods: The Insight-HXMT Data Analysis
Software package (HXMTDAS) is utilized to extract the spectra of Cas A, blank
sky, and Crab Nebula using different Good Time Interval (GTI) selections. We
fit a model with a power-law continuum and several Gaussian lines to different
ranges of Cas A and blank sky spectra to get peak energies of their lines
through xspec. After updating the energy gain calibration in CALibration
DataBase (CALDB), we rerun the Cas A data to obtain the energy resolution. An
empirical function is used to modify the simulated effective areas so that the
background-subtracted spectrum of the Crab Nebula can best match the standard
model of the Crab Nebula. Results: The energy gain, resolution, and effective
areas are calibrated every month. The corresponding calibration results are
duly updated in CALDB, which can be downloaded and used for the analysis of
Insight-HXMT data. Simultaneous observations with NuSTAR and NICER can also be
used to verify our derived results. Conclusion: LE is a well calibrated X-ray
telescope working in 1-10 keV band. The uncertainty of LE gain is less than 20
eV in 2-9 keV band and the uncertainty of LE resolution is less than 15eV. The
systematic errors of LE, compared to the model of the Crab Nebula, are lower
than 1.5% in 1-10 keV.

and a leading cause of death and chronic illness in newborns, infants, and
children. Prenatal screening and identification of CHD are critically
important, but their availability and accuracy are limited by current fetal
imaging techniques. To date, few models have been developed for fetal
circulation. Considering the fetal aorta is frequently affected in CHDs, this
study aims to develop and validate a novel model to assess the hemodynamics of
the fetal aorta. Methods - Fetal echocardiography (FE) and Doppler were used to
build a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) model that assesses the fetal aorta
in 3 dimensions. An inverse approach was used to obtain the material property.
An iterative method was also proposed to estimate the outflow boundaries. The
FSI results have been validated against clinically measured dimensions and
velocities over a cardiac cycle for aortas in 4 healthy fetuses. Results - The
proposed FSI model has been implemented in 4 healthy fetal aortas representing
a range of gestational age (GA = 23.5-36.0 weeks). The iterative method
successfully estimated Windkessel parameters that match in vivo measured flow
rates at outflow boundaries. The FSI model has been validated using in vivo
velocity waveforms at the aortic isthmus. The resultant L2-norm was [12.5%,
16.4%], which is acceptable based on previous simulation studies. Also, the
aortic stiffness of the fetal aorta decreased with GA, adding evidence to an
existing controversy about the trend between aortic stiffness and GA.
Conclusions - This study represents the first-of-its-kind endeavor of a
rigorously validated personalized flow model for fetal circulation. The
developed FSI model has been successfully validated for four subjects. The
model was also used to obtain new evidence of fetal aortic development and
growth.

investigating novel learning algorithms to overcome catastrophic forgetting of
neural networks. Most recent publications have focused on improving learning
algorithms without distinguishing effects caused by the choice of neural
architecture.Therefore, we study how the choice of neural network architecture
affects catastrophic forgetting in class- and domain-incremental semantic
segmentation. Specifically, we compare the well-researched CNNs to recently
proposed Transformers and Hybrid architectures, as well as the impact of the
choice of novel normalization layers and different decoder heads. We find that
traditional CNNs like ResNet have high plasticity but low stability, while
transformer architectures are much more stable. When the inductive biases of
CNN architectures are combined with transformers in hybrid architectures, it
leads to higher plasticity and stability. The stability of these models can be
explained by their ability to learn general features that are robust against
distribution shifts. Experiments with different normalization layers show that
Continual Normalization achieves the best trade-off in terms of adaptability
and stability of the model. In the class-incremental setting, the choice of the
normalization layer has much less impact. Our experiments suggest that the
right choice of architecture can significantly reduce forgetting even with
naive fine-tuning and confirm that for real-world applications, the
architecture is an important factor in designing a continual learning model.

revolutionized the approach in artificial intelligence to human-model
interaction. Several publications on ChatGPT evaluation test its effectiveness
on well-known natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, the existing
studies are mostly non-automated and tested on a very limited scale. In this
work, we examined ChatGPT's capabilities on 25 diverse analytical NLP tasks,
most of them subjective even to humans, such as sentiment analysis, emotion
recognition, offensiveness, and stance detection. In contrast, the other tasks
require more objective reasoning like word sense disambiguation, linguistic
acceptability, and question answering. We also evaluated GPT-4 model on five
selected subsets of NLP tasks. We automated ChatGPT and GPT-4 prompting process
and analyzed more than 49k responses. Our comparison of its results with
available State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solutions showed that the average loss in
quality of the ChatGPT model was about 25% for zero-shot and few-shot
evaluation. For GPT-4 model, a loss for semantic tasks is significantly lower
than for ChatGPT. We showed that the more difficult the task (lower SOTA
performance), the higher the ChatGPT loss. It especially refers to pragmatic
NLP problems like emotion recognition. We also tested the ability to
personalize ChatGPT responses for selected subjective tasks via Random
Contextual Few-Shot Personalization, and we obtained significantly better
user-based predictions. Additional qualitative analysis revealed a ChatGPT
bias, most likely due to the rules imposed on human trainers by OpenAI. Our
results provide the basis for a fundamental discussion of whether the high
quality of recent predictive NLP models can indicate a tool's usefulness to
society and how the learning and validation procedures for such systems should
be established.

formation of hotspots, which are known to govern high explosive initiation
behavior. Most of these mechanisms, including pore collapse, interfacial
friction, and shear banding, involve both compressive and shear work done
within the material and have thus far remained difficult to separate. We assess
hotspots formed at shocked crystal-crystal interfaces using quasi-1D molecular
dynamics simulations that isolate effects due to compression and shear. Two
high explosive materials are considered (TATB and PETN) that exhibit distinctly
different levels of molecular conformational flexibility and crystal packing
anisotropy. Temperature and intra-molecular strain energy localization in the
hotspot is assessed through parametric variation of the crystal orientation and
two velocity components that respectively modulate compression and shear work.
The resulting hotspots are found to be highly localized to a region within 5-20
nm of the crystal-crystal interface. Compressive work plays a considerably
larger role in localizing temperature and intra-molecular strain energy for
both materials and all crystal orientations considered. Shear induces a
moderate increase in energy localization relative to unsheared cases only for
relatively weak compressive shock pressures of approximately 10 GPa. These
results help isolate and rank the relative importance of hotspot generation
mechanisms and are anticipated to guide the treatment of crystal-crystal
interfaces in coarse-grained models of polycrystalline high explosive
materials.

computer vision, given their crucial role in understanding 3D scenes.
Performing any of them by relying on a single image is an ill-posed problem.
The recent advances in the field of deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs)
have revolutionized many tasks in computer vision, including depth estimation
and image deblurring. When it comes to using defocused images, the depth
estimation and the recovery of the All-in-Focus (Aif) image become related
problems due to defocus physics. In spite of this, most of the existing models
treat them separately. There are, however, recent models that solve these
problems simultaneously by concatenating two networks in a sequence to first
estimate the depth or defocus map and then reconstruct the focused image based
on it. We propose a DNN that solves the depth estimation and image deblurring
in parallel. Our Two-headed Depth Estimation and Deblurring Network (2HDED:NET)
extends a conventional Depth from Defocus (DFD) network with a deblurring
branch that shares the same encoder as the depth branch. The proposed method
has been successfully tested on two benchmarks, one for indoor and the other
for outdoor scenes: NYU-v2 and Make3D. Extensive experiments with 2HDED:NET on

be described by the Schottky contribution from the crystal-electric-field (CEF)

split of the ground-state doublet and the gap between the ground state and

conductivity in a broad temperature range that can be attributed to the
scattering by the magnetic excitations, which are mainly associated with the
CEF levels. There is strong magnetic field dependence of thermal conductivity,
which is more likely related to the field-induced changes of phonon scattering
by the CEF levels than magnetic transitions or spin excitations. For magnetic
field along the [111] direction, there is large thermal Hall conductivity at
low temperatures which displays a broad peak around 8 T. At high fields up to
14 T, the thermal Hall conductivity decreases to zero, which supports its
origin from either the spinon transport or the phonon skew scattering by CEF

cluster initial mass function, the cluster formation rate, cluster mass loss
due to stellar evolution and the clusters' dynamical evolution in the Galactic
tidal field. The obtained tidal masses have been added to the MWSC catalogue. A
general CMF (GCMF), built for all cluster ages around the Sun, extends over
four decades in mass. The high-mass slope is +1.14. The CMFs for different age
groups show the same high-mass slopes, while the low-mass slope is flat for the
youngest sub-sample and about -0.7 for the others. The sub-samples inside and
outside the solar Galactocentric radius are consistent with the GCMF, once the
exponential decline of the Galactic disc density is taken into account. The
model suggests star formation with low efficiency of 15%, where 10% of stars
remain bound in a cluster after gas expulsion and violent relaxation. The
cluster formation rate required to reproduce the observed age-mass-distribution
is 0.4 solar masses per square pc and Gyr. The obtained high-mass slope of the
GCMF for the wide solar neighbourhood is similar to slopes determined in nearby

provides strain and composition as degrees of freedom to control the bandgap

thermophotovoltaic device is composed of a fully relaxed Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$
double heterostructure corresponding to a bandgap energy of 0.29 eV. A
theoretical framework is derived to evaluate cell performance under high
injection. The black-body radiation absorption is investigated using the
generalized transfer matrix method thereby considering the mixed
coherent/incoherent layer stacking. Moreover, the intrinsic recombination
mechanisms and their importance in a narrow bandgap semiconductor were also
taken into account. In this regard, the parabolic band approximation and
Fermi's golden rule were combined for an accurate estimation of the radiative
recombination rate. Based on these analyses, power conversion efficiencies of
up to 9% are predicted for Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$ thermophotovoltaic cells

improvement in the efficiency is observed under the frontside illumination but

illumination of both the 405 nm and 532 nm lasers. We quantified this

such a solution to learn a shared model while keeping training data at local

our algorithms to accommodate various practical FL scenarios when only a subset

into account when interpreting data from astronomical surveys. Because of the
physical limitations of observing time and instrument sensitivity, datasets are
rarely complete. However, determining specifically what is missing from any
sample is not always straightforward. For example, there are always more faint
objects (such as galaxies) than bright ones in any brightness-limited sample,
but faint objects may not be of the same kind as bright ones. Assuming they are
can lead to mischaracterizing the population of objects near the boundary of
what can be detected. Similarly, starting with nearby objects that can be well
observed and assuming that objects much farther away (and sampled from a
younger universe) are of the same kind can lead us astray. Demographic models
of galaxy populations can be used as inputs to observing system simulations to
create ``mock'' catalogues that can be used to characterize and account for
multiple, interacting selection effects. The use of simulations for this
purpose is common practice in astronomy, and blurs the line between
observations and simulations; the observational data cannot be interpreted
independent of the simulations. We will describe this methodology and argue
that astrophysicists have developed effective ways to establish the reliability
of simulation-dependent observational programs. The reliability depends on how
well the physical and demographic properties of the simulated population can be
constrained through independent observations. We also identify a new challenge
raised by the use of simulations, which we call the ``problem of uncomputed
alternatives.'' Sometimes the simulations themselves create unintended
selection effects when the limits of what can be simulated lead astronomers to
only consider a limited space of alternative proposals.

difficult task. If detected at an early stage, it could facilitate speech
therapists to observe and rectify the speech patterns of persons who stutter
(PWS). The stuttered speech of PWS is usually available in limited amounts and
is highly imbalanced. To this end, we address the class imbalance problem in

contribution of classes in the overall loss function, resulting in a huge
improvement in stuttering classes on the SEP-28k dataset over the baseline

fact, the prevailing view in the community so far has been that the warp metric
necessarily has negative energies. In this work it is shown that the issue of
negative energy densities associated with the Alcubierre warp metric with a
general form function and similar metrics can be addressed when the whole
non--vacuum Einstein equations of the system are examined. To this end, we have
considered matter content in the form of anisotropic fluids. We have succeeded
in writing the Einstein equations in such a way that some general constraints
on the material content become evident. This means that, in rectangular
coordinates, the energy density depends necessarily on the tangential pressures
of the fluid. For matter such as dust or isotropic fluids we find that density
and other related quantities become identically zero. This makes the negative
energy problem spurious. It is also revealed that constructing Alcubierre-based
metrics using cylindrical and spherical coordinates results in a system of
equations that are amenable to more systematic analysis. The field equations
constrain the dependence of the form function and how this impacts the matter
content. In all cases we determine that energy density is not mandatory
negative, despite the recurrent claims in the literature.This result prompts a
reevaluation of the negative energy requirements and underscore the importance
of cylindrical and spherical type-warps to demonstrate that negative energy
density is not an intrinsic unavoidable feature of warp drives.

so, we identify all the uncompensated effects on the radio signal and see which
coronal processes drive them. From a technical standpoint, quantifying the
effect of the plasma on the radio signal helps phase referencing for precision
spacecraft tracking. The phase fluctuation of the signal was determined for
Mars' orbit for solar elongation angles from 0 - 180 deg. The calculated phase
residuals allow determination of the phase power spectrum. The total electron
content (TEC) of the solar plasma along the line of sight is calculated by
removing effects from mechanical and ionospheric noises. The spectral index was
determined as $-2.43 \pm 0.11$ which is in agreement with Kolomogorov's
turbulence. The theoretical models are consistent with observations at lower
solar elongations however at higher solar elongation ($>$160 deg) we see the
observed values to be higher. This can be caused when the uplink and downlink
signals are positively correlated as a result of passing through identical

generates the Doppler shift which leads to channel uncertainties. Moreover, the
reasons for channel uncertainties also include the finite channel feedback,
channels state information (CSI) loss and latency. With this concern, we
formulate a joint spectrum and power allocation problem for V2X communication
with imperfect CSI. Specifically, the sum capacity of cellular user equipments
(CUEs) is maximized subject to the minimum Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise
Ratio (SINR) requirements of CUEs and the outage probability constraints of
vehicular user equipments (VUEs). Then, two different robust resource
allocation approaches are designed to solve the problem. One is Bernstein
Approximation-based Robust Resource Allocation approach. More specifically,
Bernstein approximations are employed to convert the chance constraint into a
calculable constraint, and Bisection search method is proposed to obtain the
optimal allocation solution with low complexity. Then, for further reducing the
computational complexity, Self-learning Robust Resource Allocation approach,
which includes a learning method and an analytical mapping method, is proposed
as the second approach. The learning method is devised to learn the uncertainty
set which transforms the chance constraint into calculable constraints, and the
analytical mapping method is proposed to obtain closed-form solutions of the
resource allocation problem. Finally, the simulation results prove that the
proposed approaches can improve the capacity of all CUEs effectively whilst
ensuring the reliability of the channel.

  turbulence",,,,,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.SR physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pressure anisotropy can strongly influence the dynamics of weakly
collisional, high-beta plasmas, but its effects are missed by standard
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Small changes to the magnetic-field strength
generate large pressure-anisotropy forces, heating the plasma, driving
instabilities, and rearranging flows, even on scales far above the particles'
gyroscales where kinetic effects are traditionally considered most important.
Here, we study the influence of pressure anisotropy on turbulent plasmas
threaded by a mean magnetic field (Alfv\'enic turbulence). Extending previous
results that were concerned with Braginskii MHD, we consider a wide range of
regimes and parameters using a simplified fluid model based on drift kinetics
with heat fluxes calculated using a Landau-fluid closure. We show that viscous
pressure-anisotropy heating dissipates between a quarter and half of the
turbulent cascade power injected at large scales. This will in turn influence
the plasma's thermodynamics by regulating energy partition between different
dissipation channels (e.g., electron and ion heat). However, due to the
pressure anisotropy's rapid dynamical feedback onto the flows that create it --
an effect we term `magneto-immutability' -- the viscous heating is confined to
a narrow range of scales near the forcing scale, supporting a nearly
conservative, MHD-like inertial range. Despite the simplified model, our
results -- including the viscous heating rate, distributions, and turbulent
spectra -- compare favourably to recent hybrid-kinetic simulations. This is
promising for the more general use of extended-fluid (or even MHD) approaches
to model weakly collisional plasmas such as the intracluster medium, hot
accretion flows, and the solar wind.

intensively explored in recent years. Combining T-matrix approximation and
linear-response-theory, an interesting picture emerges, if two
interaction-induced quasi-particles bands in NFL are partially occupied, FO in
this situation is determined by a novel structure in momentum space, i.e. the
'average Fermi surface' (average over two quasi-particle Fermi surface), which
highlights the inter-band particle-hole excitation. We hope our study here
provides a counterintuitive example in which FO with Fermi surface coexists
with NFL quasi-particle, and it may be useful to detect hidden 'average Fermi

are typically used in calculations of lattice vibrational and transport
properties as they contain the smallest number of degrees of freedom and thus
have the cheapest computational cost. However, in complex materials, the FBZ
can take on irregular shapes where lattice symmetries are not apparent. Thus,
conventional cells (with more atoms and regular shapes) are often used to
describe materials, though dynamical and transport calculations are more
expensive. Here we discuss an efficient anharmonic lattice dynamic method that
maps conventional cell dynamics to primitive cell dynamics based on
translational symmetries. This leads to phase interference conditions that act
like conserved quantum numbers and a conservation rule for phonon scattering
that is hidden in conventional dynamics which significantly reduces
computational cost. We demonstrate this method for phonon transport in a
variety of materials with inputs from first-principles calculations and
attribute its efficiency to reduced scattering phase space and fewer summations
in scattering matrix element calculations.

to recover memory upsets (i.e., faults) before they propagate to the

mitigation schemes? Can they effectively recover upsets in high altitude or
large scale applications under different workloads? This article answers the
above research questions through a solid study that entails accelerated neutron
radiation testing and dependability analysis. We test the device on a broad
range of workloads, like multi-threaded software used for pose estimation and
weather prediction or a software/hardware (SW/HW) co-design image
classification application running on the AMD Deep Learning Processing Unit
(DPU). Assuming a one-node MPSoC system in New York City (NYC) at 40k feet, all
tested software applications achieve a Mean Time To Failure (MTTF) greater than
148 months, which shows that upsets are effectively recovered in the processing
system of the MPSoC. However, the SW/HW co-design (i.e., DPU) in the same
one-node system at 40k feet has an MTTF = 4 months due to the high failure rate
of its PL accelerator, which emphasises that some MPSoC workloads may require
additional NSEU mitigation schemes. Nevertheless, we show that the MTTF of the
DPU can increase to 87 months without any overhead if one disregards the
failure rate of tolerable errors since they do not affect the correctness of

university and high school courses is primarily based on what Feynman labeled
as the ``flux rule'', downgrading it from the status of physical law. However,
Maxwell derived a ``general law of electromagnetic induction'' in which the
vector potential plays a fundamental role. A modern reformulation of Maxwell's
law can be easily obtained by defining the induced electromotive force as
$\oint_l (\vec E +\vec v_c\times \vec B)\cdot\vec{dl}$, where $\vec v_c$ is the
velocity of the positive charges which, by convention, are the current
carriers. Maxwell did not possess a model for the electric current. Therefore,
in his law, he took $\vec v_c$ to be the velocity of the circuit element
containing the charges. This paper aims to show that the modern reformulation
of Maxwell's law governs electromagnetic induction and that the ``flux rule''
is not a physical law but only a calculation shortcut that does not always
yield the correct predictions. The paper also tries to understand why Maxwell's
law has been ignored, and how the ``flux rule'' has taken root. Finally, a
section is dedicated to teaching this modern reformulation of Maxwell's law in
high schools and elementary physics courses.

example of disordered media) represents a formidable tool to identify effective
flow and transport properties. In particular, we are interested here in the
scattering of a passive scalar as determined by a steady velocity field which
is generated by a line of singularity. The velocity undergoes to erratic
spatial variations, and concurrently the evolution of the scattering is
conveniently described within a stochastic framework that regards the
conductivity of the hosting medium as a stationary, Gaussian, random field.
Unlike the similar one for uniform (in the mean) flow-fields, the problem at
stake results much more complex. Central for the present study is the
fluctuation of the driving field, that is computed in closed (analytical) form
as large time limit of the same quantity in the unsteady state flow regime. The
structure of the second-order moment X_{rr}, quantifying the scattering along
the radial direction, is explained by the rapid change of the distance along
which the velocities of two fluid particles become uncorrelated. Moreover, two
approximate, analytical expressions are shown to be quite accurate into
reproducing the full simulations of X_{rr}. Finally, the same problem is
encountered in other fields, belonging both to the classical and to the quantum
physics. As such, our results lend themselves to be used within a context much
wider than that exploited in the present study.

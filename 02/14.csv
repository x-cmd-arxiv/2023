features of the solution space have been used to rigorously rule out powerful
classes of algorithms. This is often accomplished through the lens of the multi
Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP), a rigorous barrier against algorithms
exhibiting input stability. In this paper, we focus on the algorithmic
tractability of two models: (i) discrepancy minimization, and (ii) the
symmetric binary perceptron (\texttt{SBP}), a random constraint satisfaction
problem as well as a toy model of a single-layer neural network.
  Our first focus is on the limits of online algorithms. By establishing and
leveraging a novel geometrical barrier, we obtain sharp hardness guarantees
against online algorithms for both the \texttt{SBP} and discrepancy
minimization. Our results match the best known algorithmic guarantees, up to
constant factors. Our second focus is on efficiently finding a constant
discrepancy solution, given a random matrix $\mathcal{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times
n}$. In a smooth setting, where the entries of $\mathcal{M}$ are i.i.d.
standard normal, we establish the presence of $m$-OGP for $n=\Theta(M\log M)$.
Consequently, we rule out the class of stable algorithms at this value. These
results give the first rigorous evidence towards a conjecture of Altschuler and
Niles-Weed~\cite[Conjecture~1]{altschuler2021discrepancy}.
  Our methods use the intricate geometry of the solution space to prove tight
hardness results for online algorithms. The barrier we establish is a novel
variant of the $m$-OGP. Furthermore, it regards $m$-tuples of solutions with

Importantly, our results rule out online algorithms succeeding even with an

magnetic field, as well as to make predictions about the fields and flows that
structure the solar wind. We compare predictions from two SFT models for the
solar wind, open magnetic field footpoints, and the presence of coronal
magnetic null points throughout various phases of a solar activity cycle,
focusing on the months of April in even-numbered years between 2012 and 2020,
inclusive. We find that there is a solar cycle dependence to each of the
metrics considered, but there is not a single phase of the cycle in which all
the metrics indicate good agreement between the models. The metrics also reveal
large, transient differences between the models when a new active region is
rotating into the assimilation window. The evolution of the surface flux is
governed by a combination of large scale flows and comparatively small scale
motions associated with convection. Because the latter flows evolve rapidly,
there are intervals during which their impact on the surface flux can only be
characterized in a statistical sense, thus their impact is modeled by
introducing a random evolution that reproduces the typical surface flux
evolution. We find that the differences between the predicted properties are
dominated by differences in the model assumptions and implementation, rather
than selection of a particular realization of the random evolution.

Dissection exist for more general systems whose nonzero structures encode
well-shaped simplicial complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
  We generalize the specialized solvers for $1$-Laplacians to weighted
simplicial complexes with additional geometric structures and improve the
runtime of Nested Dissection. Specifically, we consider simplicial complexes
embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that: (1) the complex triangulates a convex
ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, (2) the underlying topological space of the complex is
convex and has a bounded aspect ratio, and (3) each tetrahedron has a bounded

approximately solve weighted $1$-Laplacian systems in a stable simplicial
complex with $n$ simplexes up to high precision in time $\tilde{O} (n^{3/2})$
if the ratio between the maximum and minimum simplex weights is
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/6})$. In addition, we generalize this solver to a union of
stable simplicial complex chunks. As a result, our solver has a comparable
runtime, parameterized by the number of chunks and the number of simplexes
shared by more than one chunk. Our solvers are inspired by the Incomplete

Chern-Simons-Higgs field theories. For a simple microscopic Hamiltonian, we

combining human judgment with statistical models to improve decision-making.
Research in this area often evaluates proposed improvements to models,
interfaces, or workflows by demonstrating improved predictive performance on
""ground truth"" labels. However, this practice overlooks a key difference
between human judgments and model predictions. Whereas humans reason about
broader phenomena of interest in a decision -- including latent constructs that
are not directly observable, such as disease status, the ""toxicity"" of online
comments, or future ""job performance"" -- predictive models target proxy labels
that are readily available in existing datasets. Predictive models' reliance on
simplistic proxies makes them vulnerable to various sources of statistical
bias. In this paper, we identify five sources of target variable bias that can
impact the validity of proxy labels in human-AI decision-making tasks. We
develop a causal framework to disentangle the relationship between each bias
and clarify which are of concern in specific human-AI decision-making tasks. We
demonstrate how our framework can be used to articulate implicit assumptions
made in prior modeling work, and we recommend evaluation strategies for
verifying whether these assumptions hold in practice. We then leverage our
framework to re-examine the designs of prior human subjects experiments that
investigate human-AI decision-making, finding that only a small fraction of
studies examine factors related to target variable bias. We conclude by
discussing opportunities to better address target variable bias in future
research.

class of generative models. However, a fundamental limitation is that their
sampling process is slow due to a need for many (\eg, $2000$) iterations of
sequential computations. An intuitive acceleration method is to reduce the
sampling iterations which however causes severe performance degradation. We
assault this problem to the ill-conditioned issues of the Langevin dynamics and
reverse diffusion in the sampling process. Under this insight, we propose a
model-agnostic {\bf\em preconditioned diffusion sampling} (PDS) method that
leverages matrix preconditioning to alleviate the aforementioned problem. PDS
alters the sampling process of a vanilla SGM at marginal extra computation
cost, and without model retraining. Theoretically, we prove that PDS preserves
the output distribution of the SGM, no risk of inducing systematical bias to
the original sampling process. We further theoretically reveal a relation
between the parameter of PDS and the sampling iterations,easing the parameter
estimation under varying sampling iterations. Extensive experiments on various
image datasets with a variety of resolutions and diversity validate that our
PDS consistently accelerates off-the-shelf SGMs whilst maintaining the
synthesis quality. In particular, PDS can accelerate by up to $29\times$ on
more challenging high resolution (1024$\times$1024) image generation. Compared
with the latest generative models (\eg, CLD-SGM, DDIM, and Analytic-DDIM), PDS
can achieve the best sampling quality on CIFAR-10 at a FID score of 1.99. Our

represent a regular language more concisely than conventional automata by
allowing edges to be labeled not only with characters, but also strings.
Hashiguchi proved that the problem of determining the minimum number of states
of a generalized automata recognizing a given language is decidable [ICALP
1991]. Subsequently, Giammaresi and Montalbano introduced a notion of
determinism for generalized automata [STACS 1995, TCS 1999]. While generalized
deterministic automata retain many properties of conventional deterministic
automata, the uniqueness of a minimal generalized deterministic automaton is
lost. In this paper, we show that the lack of uniqueness can be explained by
introducing a set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ associated with a generalized automaton $
\mathcal{A} $. The set $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ is always trivially equal to the set
of all prefixes of the language recognized by the automaton, if $ \mathcal{A} $
is a conventional automaton, but this need not be true for generalized
automata. By fixing $ \mathcal{W(A)} $, we are able to derive for the first
time a full Myhill-Nerode theorem for generalized automata, which contains the
classical Myhill-Nerode theorem for conventional automata as a degenerate case.
In the conclusions, we outline the essential role that $ \mathcal{W(A)} $ plays
in graph compression, allowing to extend the class of regular languages that
can be indexed and compressed.

composition of the ring particles on the net scattered polarization. For the
spherical ring particles, we applied the Mie scattering theory. We studied the
flux and polarization of the scattered stellar radiation as a function of
planetary phase angle and wavelength from the optical to the near-infrared. For
the chosen grain size distribution, the dust particles in the ring show strong
forward scattering at the considered wavelengths. Thus, the reflected flux of
the planet dominates the total reflected and polarized flux at small phase
angles. However, the scattered and polarized flux of the ring increase at large
phase angles and exceeds the total reflected planetary flux. For large rings
that contain silicate particles, the total reflected flux is dominated by the
radiation scattered by the dust in the ring at all phase angles. As a result,
the orientation of polarization is parallel to the scattering plane at small
phase angles. In contrast, for a ring that contains water ice particles, the
orientation of polarization is parallel to the scattering plane at large phase
angles. Depending on the ring inclination and orientation, the total reflected
and polarized flux show a specific distribution as well. Large particles show a
strong polarization at large phase angles compared to smaller particles. For a

features are missing in the spectrum of a ringed planet.

potential to automate and improve various tasks, such as image analysis and

with the need for image labeling, lead to biased datasets that limit the
generalizability of algorithms trained on them. One of the emerging solutions
for this challenge is synthetic histological images. However, debiasing real
datasets require not only generating photorealistic images but also the ability
to control the features within them. A common approach is to use generative
methods that perform image translation between semantic masks that reflect
prior knowledge of the tissue and a histological image. However, unlike other
image domains, the complex structure of the tissue prevents a simple creation
of histology semantic masks that are required as input to the image translation
model, while semantic masks extracted from real images reduce the process's
scalability. In this work, we introduce a scalable generative model, coined as
DEPAS, that captures tissue structure and generates high-resolution semantic
masks with state-of-the-art quality. We demonstrate the ability of DEPAS to
generate realistic semantic maps of tissue for three types of organs: skin,
prostate, and lung. Moreover, we show that these masks can be processed using a
generative image translation model to produce photorealistic histology images
of two types of cancer with two different types of staining techniques.
Finally, we harness DEPAS to generate multi-label semantic masks that capture
different cell types distributions and use them to produce histological images
with on-demand cellular features. Overall, our work provides a state-of-the-art
solution for the challenging task of generating synthetic histological images

cannot be simplified in a useful manner. Consequently, non-traditional
approaches such as surrogate modeling using data-driven model order reduction
are used to make complex high-fidelity models more widely available anyway.
They often involve a dimensionality reduction step, in which the
high-dimensional system state is transformed onto a low-dimensional subspace or

While most publications focus on one dimensionality reduction, such as
principal component analysis~(PCA) (linear) or autoencoder (nonlinear), we
consider and compare PCA, kernel PCA, autoencoders, as well as variational
autoencoders for the approximation of a structural dynamical system. In detail,
we demonstrate the benefits of the surrogate modeling approach on a complex FE

Digital Sky Survey has been a topic of debate in the past two decades, with
conflicting conclusions reported even in cases where the same data was used.
Here we follow one of the previous experiments by applying the SpArcFiRe
algorithm to annotate the spin directions in original dataset of Galaxy Zoo 1.
The annotation of the galaxy spin directions is done after a first step of
selecting the spiral galaxies in three different manners: manual analysis by
Galaxy Zoo classifications, by a model-driven computer analysis, and with no
selection of spiral galaxies. The results show that when spiral galaxies are
selected by Galaxy Zoo volunteers, the distribution of their spin directions as
determined by SpArcFiRe is not random, which agrees with previous reports. When
selecting the spiral galaxies using a model-driven computer analysis or without
selecting the spiral galaxies at all, the distribution is also not random.
Simple binomial distribution analysis shows that the probability of the parity
violation to occur by chance is lower than 0.01. Fitting the spin directions as
observed from Earth to cosine dependence exhibits a dipole axis with
statistical strength of 2.33$\sigma$ to 3.97$\sigma$. These experiments show
that regardless of the selection mechanism and the analysis method, all
experiments show similar conclusions. These results are aligned with previous
reports using other methods and telescopes, suggesting that the spin directions
of spiral galaxies as observed from Earth exhibit a dipole axis formed by their
spin directions. Possible explanations can be related to the large-scale
structure of the Universe, or to internal structure of galaxies. The catalogs
of annotated galaxies generated as part of this study are available.

consensus about the mechanisms that cause IMF variations is yet to be reached.
Recently, it has been suggested that stars formed early-on in cosmic time, via
a star formation burst, could be characterised by a bottom-heavy IMF. A
promising way to confirm this is to use relics, ultra-compact massive galaxies,
almost entirely composed by these ""pristine"" stars. The INSPIRE Project aims at
assembling a large sample of confirmed relics, that can serve as laboratory to
investigate on the conditions of star formation in the first 1-3 Gyr of the
Universe. In this third INSPIRE paper, we build a high signal-to-noise spectrum
from five relics and one from five galaxies with similar sizes, masses, and
kinematical properties, but characterised by a more extended star formation
history (non-relics). Our detailed stellar population analysis suggests a
systematically bottom-heavier IMF slope for relics than for non-relics, adding
new observational evidence for the non-universality of the IMF at various
redshifts and further supporting the above proposed physical scenario.

Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-based ceramic films is captured. Infrared imaging provides a
robust technique to reduce the ratio between the adiabatic and the measured
electrocaloric temperature change in micrometer-sized ceramic films to a
single-digit number, ~3.5. The obtained results are validated with another
direct thermometric method and compared with the results obtained with an
indirect approach. Despite different measurement principles, the results
obtained with the two direct methods agree well. The proposed approach is
timely and could open a door to verify the predicted giant electrocaloric
effects in ceramic films, thus accelerating the process of their integration
into functional devices.

model uncertainty quantification. To this end, we propose tractable dropout

analytical solution to Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) through variance propagation.
Unlike MCD in neural networks, which comes at the cost of multiple network

tagged-particle VACF for simple fluids. Our approach is distinguished from
previous efforts in two key ways: collective hydrodynamic modes are modeled by
\emph{linear} hydrodynamic equations; the fluid's static kinetic energy
spectrum is identified as a necessary initial condition for the momentum
current correlation. Our formulation leads to a natural physical interpretation
of the hydrodynamic VACF as a superposition of quasinormal hydrodynamic modes
weighted commensurately with the static kinetic energy spectrum, which appears
to be essential to bridging continuum hydrodynamical behavior and
discrete-particle kinetics. Our methodology yields VACF calculations
quantitatively on par with existing approaches for liquid noble gases and
alkali metals; moreover, our hydrodynamic model for the self-intermediate
scattering function extends the applicable domain to low densities where the
Schmidt number is of order unity, enabling calculations for gases and

inputs that contain irrelevant data has received little attention in the
reinforcement learning literature. To start resolving this, we formulate a
problem setting in reinforcement learning called the $\textit{extremely noisy
environment}$ (ENE), where up to $99\%$ of the input features are pure noise.
Agents need to detect which features provide task-relevant information about
the state of the environment. Consequently, we propose a new method termed
$\textit{Automatic Noise Filtering}$ (ANF), which uses the principles of
dynamic sparse training in synergy with various deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. The sparse input layer learns to focus its connectivity on
task-relevant features, such that ANF-SAC and ANF-TD3 outperform standard SAC
and TD3 by a large margin, while using up to $95\%$ fewer weights. Furthermore,
we devise a transfer learning setting for ENEs, by permuting all features of
the environment after 1M timesteps to simulate the fact that other information
sources can become relevant as the world evolves. Again, ANF surpasses the
baselines in final performance and sample complexity. Our code is available at

considerable amounts of data, while the availability of unbiased training data

validate AI algorithms. Yet, controlling the exact distribution of cellular
features within them is still challenging. One of the solutions is harnessing
conditional generative adversarial networks that take a semantic mask as an
input rather than a random noise. Unlike other domains, outlining the exact
cellular structure of tissues is hard, and most of the input masks depict
regions of cell types. However, using polygon-based masks introduce inherent
artifacts within the synthetic images - due to the mismatch between the polygon
size and the single-cell size. In this work, we show that introducing random
single-pixel noise with the appropriate spatial frequency into a polygon
semantic mask can dramatically improve the quality of the synthetic images. We
used our platform to generate synthetic images of immunohistochemistry-treated
lung biopsies. We test the quality of the images using a three-fold validation
procedure. First, we show that adding the appropriate noise frequency yields
87% of the similarity metrics improvement that is obtained by adding the actual
single-cell features. Second, we show that the synthetic images pass the Turing

improves AI performance in terms of PD-L1 semantic segmentation performances.

in the training process, that prevent them from learning the optimal policy.
They are not able to visit and interact with every possible state

obstacles. In this work, we propose using intrinsic rewards to balance between
exploration and exploitation and explore depending on the uncertainty of the
states instead of on the time the agent has been trained, encouraging the agent
to get more curious about unknown states. We explain the benefits of the
approach and compare it with other exploration algorithms that may be used for
crowd navigation. Many simulation experiments are performed modifying several
algorithms of the state-of-the-art, showing that the use of intrinsic rewards

learn the scene depth from images in a supervised setting, they often overlook
the invaluable invariances and priors in the rigid scene space, such as the
regularity of the scene. The paper's main contribution is to reveal the benefit
of classical and well-founded variational constraints in the neural network
design for the SIDP task. It is shown that imposing first-order variational
constraints in the scene space together with popular encoder-decoder-based
network architecture design provides excellent results for the supervised SIDP

the depth gradient in the scene space, i.e., regularity. The paper demonstrates
the usefulness of the proposed approach via extensive evaluation and ablation

utilized stereotyped traveling-wave gait templates and relied on local body

gait template design for OAL remains less studied. In this paper, we explore
novel gait templates for OAL based on tools derived from geometric mechanics

expand the scope of GM to obstacle-rich environments. Specifically, we
establish a model that maps the presence of an obstacle to directional

  Training Applied to Image Recognition Problems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) and, in particular, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) have brought significant advances in a wide range of modern computer
application problems. However, the increasing availability of large amounts of
datasets as well as the increasing available computational power of modern
computers lead to a steady growth in the complexity and size of DNN and CNN
models, and thus, to longer training times. Hence, various methods and attempts
have been developed to accelerate and parallelize the training of complex
network architectures. In this work, a novel CNN-DNN architecture is proposed
that naturally supports a model parallel training strategy and that is loosely
inspired by two-level domain decomposition methods (DDM). First, local CNN
models, that is, subnetworks, are defined that operate on overlapping or
nonoverlapping parts of the input data, for example, sub-images. The
subnetworks can be trained completely in parallel. Each subnetwork outputs a
local decision for the given machine learning problem which is exclusively
based on the respective local input data. Subsequently, an additional DNN model
is trained which evaluates the local decisions of the local subnetworks and
generates a final, global decision. With respect to the analogy to DDM, the DNN
can be interpreted as a coarse problem and hence, the new approach can be
interpreted as a two-level domain decomposition. In this paper, solely image
classification problems using CNNs are considered. Experimental results for
different 2D image classification problems are provided as well as a face
recognition problem, and a classification problem for 3D computer tomography
(CT) scans. The results show that the proposed approach can significantly
accelerate the required training time compared to the global model and,
additionally, can also help to improve the accuracy of the underlying
classification problem.

a non-convex function with potentially unbounded smoothness constant using a

these functions more closely captures practical machine learning problems as
compared to the pervasive $L_0$-smoothness. This class is rich enough to
include highly non-smooth functions, such as $\exp(L_1 x)$ which is
$(0,\mathcal{O}(L_1))$-smooth. Despite the richness, an emerging line of works
achieves the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ rate of convergence
when the noise of the stochastic gradients is deterministically and uniformly
bounded. This noise restriction is not required in the $L_0$-smooth setting,
and in many practical settings is either not satisfied, or results in weaker
convergence rates with respect to the noise scaling of the convergence rate.
  We develop a technique that allows us to prove
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{\mathrm{poly}\log(T)}{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rates for
$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth functions without assuming uniform bounds on the noise
support. The key innovation behind our results is a carefully constructed
stopping time $\tau$ which is simultaneously ""large"" on average, yet also
allows us to treat the adaptive step sizes before $\tau$ as (roughly)
independent of the gradients. For general $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth functions, our
analysis requires the mild restriction that the multiplicative noise parameter
$\sigma_1 < 1$. For a broad subclass of $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth functions, our
convergence rate continues to hold when $\sigma_1 \geq 1$. By contrast, we
prove that many algorithms analyzed by prior works on $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth

EnergyShield provides not only safety interventions but also a formal,

wirelessly offloading NN computations to edge computers, while still
maintaining a formal guarantee of safety until it receives a response

and progression between successive stages are of high importance for improving
understanding of cancer evolution. Important insights into scenarios of cancer
growth, roles of somatic mutations and types/strengths of evolutionary forces
they introduce are gained by using mathematical and computer modelling.
Previous studies developed mathematical models of cancer cell evolution with
driver and passenger somatic mutations. Driver mutations were assumed to have a
strong advantageous effect on cancer cell population growth, while passenger
mutations were considered as fully neutral or mildly deleterious.
  In this paper, we develop models of cancer evolution with somatic mutations
introducing weakly advantageous force to the evolution of cancer cells. Our
models belong to two classes, deterministic and stochastic. Deterministic
models are systems of differential master equations of balances of average
numbers of cells and mutations in evolution. We, additionally introduce a
modification in equations for balances aimed at accounting for effects on the
finite size of the cancer cell population. We also derive parameters of
travelling waves of advantageous mutations we quantify their effects on
population size evolution. A stochastic model based on the Gillespie algorithm
is used to verify the results of deterministic modelling. Finally, we confront
predictions of modelling with some observational data on cancer evolution. We
propose the scenario of evolution driven by a large number of weakly
advantageous mutations in transition from the early stage to the invasive form
of breast cancer and we fit our models to observed patterns of rates of growth
of tumors.

fixed unitary operator by maximizing the set of different kinds of separable

focus on the inverse participation ratio of eigenstates and identify several
regimes on the ergodic side of the transition -- self-consistent golden rule,
golden rule, precritical, and critical -- that the system consecutively goes
through when the disorder increases towards the point $W_c$ of the localization
transition. We also perform exact-diagonalization numerics as well as a
population-dynamics analysis that combines analytical and numerical techniques.
Results of all the approaches are in excellent mutual agreement. We further
explore the evolution from ergodicity to localization in two models of

serve as an approximation for this class of many-body problems; one of our
central goals is to better understand the status of this approximation. Our
numerical simulations support the conjecture that, in the limit of a large

naturally arises a fundamental question of how to efficiently assemble these
readily available models in a family for dynamic accuracy-efficiency trade-offs
at runtime. To this end, we present Stitchable Neural Networks (SN-Net), a
novel scalable and efficient framework for model deployment. It cheaply
produces numerous networks with different complexity and performance trade-offs
given a family of pretrained neural networks, which we call anchors.
Specifically, SN-Net splits the anchors across the blocks/layers and then
stitches them together with simple stitching layers to map the activations from
one anchor to another. With only a few epochs of training, SN-Net effectively
interpolates between the performance of anchors with varying scales. At
runtime, SN-Net can instantly adapt to dynamic resource constraints by
switching the stitching positions. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
classification demonstrate that SN-Net can obtain on-par or even better
performance than many individually trained networks while supporting diverse
deployment scenarios. For example, by stitching Swin Transformers, we challenge
hundreds of models in Timm model zoo with a single network. We believe this new
elastic model framework can serve as a strong baseline for further research in
wider communities.

retrieval with inverted indexes. Multi-vector retrieval methods have
demonstrated their effectiveness on various retrieval datasets, and among them,
ColBERT is the most established method based on the late interaction of
contextualized token embeddings of pre-trained language models. However,
efficient ColBERT implementations require complex engineering and cannot take
advantage of off-the-shelf search libraries, impeding their practical use. To
address this issue, SLIM first maps each contextualized token vector to a
sparse, high-dimensional lexical space before performing late interaction
between these sparse token embeddings. We then introduce an efficient two-stage
retrieval architecture that includes inverted index retrieval followed by a
score refinement module to approximate the sparsified late interaction, which
is fully compatible with off-the-shelf lexical search libraries such as Lucene.
SLIM achieves competitive accuracy on MS MARCO Passages and BEIR compared to
ColBERT while being much smaller and faster on CPUs. To our knowledge, we are
the first to explore using sparse token representations for multi-vector
retrieval. Source code and data are integrated into the Pyserini IR toolkit.

including in few-shot settings. Thus fine-tuning allows the model to quickly
pick up task-specific ``skills,'' but there has been limited study of where
these newly-learnt skills reside inside the massive model. This paper
introduces the term skill localization for this problem and proposes a
solution. Given the downstream task and a model fine-tuned on that task, a
simple optimization is used to identify a very small subset of parameters
($\sim0.01$% of model parameters) responsible for ($>95$%) of the model's
performance, in the sense that grafting the fine-tuned values for just this
tiny subset onto the pre-trained model gives performance almost as well as the
fine-tuned model. While reminiscent of recent works on parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, the novel aspects here are that: (i) No further re-training is
needed on the subset (unlike, say, with lottery tickets). (ii) Notable
improvements are seen over vanilla fine-tuning with respect to calibration of
predictions in-distribution ($40$-$90$% error reduction) as well as the quality
of predictions out-of-distribution (OOD). In models trained on multiple tasks,
a stronger notion of skill localization is observed, where the sparse regions
corresponding to different tasks are almost disjoint, and their overlap (when
it happens) is a proxy for task similarity. Experiments suggest that
localization via grafting can assist certain forms of continual learning.

polynomial sample complexity results for learning approximate Coarse Correlated
Equilibria (CCEs) of Markov Games under decentralized linear function
approximation. Our algorithm always outputs Markov CCEs, and achieves an
optimal rate of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding
$\epsilon$-optimal solutions. Also, when restricted to the tabular case, our
result improves over the current best decentralized result
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding Markov CCEs. We further
present an alternative algorithm -- Decentralized Optimistic Policy Mirror
Descent, which finds policy-class-restricted CCEs using a polynomial number of
samples. In exchange for learning a weaker version of CCEs, this algorithm
applies to a wider range of problems under generic function approximation, such
as linear quadratic games and MARL problems with low ''marginal'' Eluder
dimension.

is largely unconstrained. Their detection is important as magnetic fields can
have a significant impact on the evolution of the CGM and, in turn, the fields
can serve as tracers for dynamical processes in the CGM. Aims. With Faraday
rotation of polarised background sources, we aim to detect a possible excess of
the rotation measure in the surrounding area of nearby galaxies. Methods. We
use 2,461 residual rotation measures (RRMs) observed with the LOw Frequency
ARray (LOFAR), where the foreground contribution from the Milky Way is
subtracted. The RRMs are then studied around a subset of 183 nearby galaxies
that was selected by apparent $B$-band magnitude. Results. We find that, in
general, the RRMs show no significant excess for small impact parameters (i.e.
the perpendicular distance to the line of sight). However, if we only consider
galaxies at higher inclination angles and sight lines that pass close to the
minor axis of the galaxies, we find significant excess at impact parameters of
less than 100 kpc. The excess in |RRM| is 3.7 $\rm rad\,m^{-2}$ with an
uncertainty between $\pm 0.9~\rm rad\,m^{-2}$ and $\pm 1.3~\rm rad\,m^{-2}$
depending on the statistical properties of the background
(2.8$\sigma$-4.1$\sigma$). With electron densities of ~$10^{-4}~\rm cm^{-3}$
this suggests magnetic field strengths of a few tenths of a micro Gauss.
Conclusions. Our results suggest a slow decrease of the magnetic field strength
with distance from the galactic disc such as expected if the CGM is magnetised
by galactic winds and outflows.

predictors capable of efficiently scanning the very large parameter space of
cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties. In this paper, we introduce the
halo model of reionization (HMreio), a new analytical tool that combines the
halo model of the cosmic dawn with the excursion-set bubble model for
reionization, assuming an empirical correction factor to deal with overlapping
ionization bubbles. First, HMreio is validated against results from the
well-known semi-numerical code 21cmFAST, showing a good overall agreement for
wave-modes of $k\lesssim 1$ h/Mpc. Based on this result, we perform a
Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain (MCMC) forecast analysis assuming mock data from
1000-hour observations with the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA) observatory. We simultaneously vary the six standard cosmological
parameters together with seven astrophysical nuisance parameters quantifying
the abundance and spectral properties of sources. Depending on the assumed
theory error, we find very competitive constraints on cosmological parameters.
In particular, it will be possible to conclusively test current cosmological
tensions related to the Hubble parameter ($H_0$-tension) and the matter
clustering amplitude ($S_8$-tension). Furthermore, the sum of the neutrino
masses can be strongly constrained, making it possible to determine the
neutrino mass hierarchy at the $\sim 90$ percent confidence level. However,
these goals can only be achieved if the current modelling uncertainties are
substantially reduced to below $\sim 3$ percent.

with ALMA and ACA data. We study the total emission and pay special attention
to the extended low-surface brightness components. We find a tight correlation
between low-J CO and [CI] line luminosities suggesting their emission arise
from similar regions, at least when averaged over galactic scales. We estimate
a median CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor of $1.7\pm 0.5$ M$_{\odot}$ (K km
s$^{-1}$ pc$^2)^{-1}$ for ULIRGs, using [CI] as an independent tracer. We
derive median galaxy-integrated CO line ratios ($r_{21}$, $r_{31}$ and
$r_{32}$), as well as $r_{CICO}$, significantly higher than normal star forming
galaxies, confirming the exceptional molecular gas properties of ULIRGs. We
find that $r_{21}$ and $r_{32}$ are poor tracers of CO excitation in ULIRGs,
while $r_{31}$ shows a positive trend with $L_{IR}$ and SFR, and a negative
trend with the H$_2$ gas depletion timescales ($\tau_{dep}$). When studying CO
line ratios as a function of gas kinematics, we find a positive relation
between $r_{21}$ and $\sigma_v$, which can be explained by CO opacity effects.
We find that the linewidths of [CI] lines are ~10% narrower than CO lines,
which may suggest that the low optical depth of [CI] can challenge its
detection in diffuse, low-surface brightness outflows, and so its use as a
tracer of CO-dark H$_2$ gas in these components. Finally, we find that higher
$L_{AGN}$ are associated to longer $\tau_{dep}$, consistent with the hypothesis
that AGN feedback may reduce the efficiency of star formation.

low mass (Mstar < 10^9.5 MSun) regime remains less well explored. In
particular, studying elliptical populations when they are blue, and therefore
rapidly building stellar mass, offers strong constraints on their formation.
Here, we study 108 blue, low-mass ellipticals (which have a median stellar mass
of 10^8.7 MSun) at z < 0.3 in the COSMOS field. Visual inspection of extremely
deep optical HSC images indicates that less than 3 per cent of these systems
have visible tidal features, a factor of 2 less than the incidence of tidal
features in a control sample of galaxies with the same distribution of stellar
mass and redshift. This suggests that the star formation activity in these
objects is not driven by mergers or interactions but by secular gas accretion.
We combine accurate physical parameters from the COSMOS2020 catalog, with
measurements of local density and the locations of galaxies in the cosmic web,
to show that our blue ellipticals reside in low-density environments, further
away from nodes and large-scale filaments than other galaxies. At similar
stellar masses and environments, blue ellipticals outnumber their normal (red)
counterparts by a factor of 2. Thus, these systems are likely progenitors of
not only normal ellipticals at similar stellar mass but, given their high star
formation rates, also of ellipticals at higher stellar masses. Secular gas
accretion, therefore, likely plays a significant (and possibly dominant) role
in the stellar assembly of elliptical galaxies in the low mass regime.

Furthermore, utilizing the new methodology, we reveal the limitations due to
finite bond dimension D on TNR applied to critical systems. We find that a
finite correlation length is imposed by the finite bond dimension in TNR, and
it can be attributed to an emergent relevant perturbation that respects the
symmetries of the system. The correlation length shows the same power-law

hole spectroscopy is one of the fundamental pillars in current and future
strong-gravity tests. Among the most remarkable findings of recent works is
that including a large number of overtones not only reduces the mismatch of the
fitted ringdown but also allows one to extract black hole parameters from a
ringdown analysis that goes well within the non-linear merger part. At the same
time, it is well understood that several details of the ringdown analysis have
important consequences for the question of whether overtones are present or
not, and subsequently, to what extent one can claim to perform black hole
spectroscopy. To clarify and tackle some aspects of overtone fitting, we
revisit the clearer problem of wave propagation in the scalar Regge-Wheeler and
P\""oschl-Teller potentials. This set-up, which is to some extent qualitatively
very similar to the non-linear merger-ringdown regime, indicates that using
even an approximate model for the overtones yields an improved extraction of
the black hole mass at early ringdown times. We find that the relevant
parameter is the number of included modes rather than using the correct model
for the overtones themselves. This further adds evidence to the proposal that
large overtone numbers may instead remove non-quasi-normal mode contributions
that are relevant at early times of a ringdown, but do not necessarily
correspond to the physical excitation of modes of the system.

magnetic charges of the latter carry native electric charge of the former. We
both provide a general symmetry-based analysis underpinning this result, and
discuss a microscopic mechanism which binds a native electric charge to the

applied electric field gives rise to an emergent magnetic field. This in turn
exerts an `inverted' Lorentz force on moving emergent electric/native magnetic
charges. This can be probed via what we term a magnetic Nernst effect: applying
an electric field perpendicular to a temperature gradient yields a
magnetisation perpendicular to both. Finally, and importantly as a further
potential experimental signature, a thermal gas of emergent magnetic charges
will make an activated contribution to the optical conductivity at low

tackle data heterogeneity across clients in FL. However, existing pFL methods
either (1) introduce high communication and computation costs or (2) overfit to
local data, which can be limited in scope, and are vulnerable to evolved test
samples with natural shifts. In this paper, we propose PerAda, a
parameter-efficient pFL framework that reduces communication and computational
costs and exhibits superior generalization performance, especially under
test-time distribution shifts. PerAda reduces the costs by leveraging the power
of pretrained models and only updates and communicates a small number of
additional parameters from adapters. PerAda has good generalization since it
regularizes each client's personalized adapter with a global adapter, while the
global adapter uses knowledge distillation to aggregate generalized information
from all clients. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds to explain
why PerAda improves generalization, and we prove its convergence to stationary
points under non-convex settings. Empirically, PerAda demonstrates competitive
personalized performance (+4.85% on CheXpert) and enables better
out-of-distribution generalization (+5.23% on CIFAR-10-C) on different datasets
across natural and medical domains compared with baselines, while only updating
12.6% of parameters per model based on the adapter.

One particular feature of exoplanet demographics is the relative prevalence of

although the system dynamics remain largely unaffected when the additional

the additional planet lies in the range 3.1-4.0 AU, and perturbations to the
Martian orbit primarily result when the additional planet lies in the range
2.0-2.7 AU. We further show that, although Jupiter and Saturn experience
relatively small orbital perturbations, the angular momentum transferred to the
ice giants can result in their ejection from the system at key resonance
locations of the additional planet. We discuss the implications of these
results for the architecture of the inner and outer solar system planets, and

rates and mode transmission and conversion coefficients between fast and slow
waves in two dimensions due to finite ion-neutral collision frequencies at
arbitrary ionization fraction. This is relevant to partially ionized
astrophysical plasmas, in particular solar and stellar atmospheres. The most
important parameter governing collisional effects is the ratio of the wave
frequency to the neutral-charges collision frequency,
$\epsilon=\omega/\nu_{nc}$, with secondary dependence on ionization fraction
and wave attack angle. Comparison is made to the one-fluid magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) case, and it is found that acoustic-to-acoustic and magnetic-to-magnetic
transmission through the Alfv\'en-acoustic equipartition layer is decreased by
a term of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ relative to one-fluid (infinite collision
frequency), and correspondingly acoustic-to-magnetic and magnetic-to-acoustic
conversion is increased. The neutral acoustic mode is shown to dissipate
rapidly as $\nu_{nc}\to\infty$. Away from the mode conversion region,
dissipative decay along the remaining magneto-acoustic rays scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ and is found to be much more effective on magnetically
dominated rays compared to acoustically dominated rays. This produces a steep
jump in dissipation in mode conversion regions, where the rays change
character, and can produce localized heating there and beyond. Applications to
the solar chromosphere are discussed.

the work of policy-making, often under the label of 'civic technology'. But
conventional forms of participation through transactions such as voting provide
limited opportunities for engagement. In response, some civic tech groups
organize around issues of shared concern to explore new forms of democratic
technologies. How does their work affect the relationship between publics and
public servants?
  This paper explores how a Civic Tech Toronto creates a platform for civic
engagement through the maintenance of an autonomous community for civic
engagement and participation that is casual, social, nonpartisan, experimental,
and flexible. Based on two years of action research, including community
organizing, interviews, and observations, this paper shows how this grassroots
civic tech group creates a civic platform that places a diverse range of
participants in contact with the work of public servants, helping to build
capacities and relationships that prepare both publics and public servants for
the work of participatory democracy.
  The case shows that understanding civic tech requires a lens beyond the mere
analysis or production of technical artifacts. As a practice for making
technologies that is social and participatory, civic tech creates alternative
modes of technology development and opportunities for experimentation and
learning, and it can reconfigure the roles of democratic participants.

Specifically, AFTRL achieves $O(1)$ external regret or $O(1)$ \emph{forward

\emph{dynamic regret} of Prod-BR. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm

investigate a type of disjointness that is only time dependent. Two walks are
said to be snapshot disjoint if they are not active in a same snapshot (also

define a Mengerian graph for time as a graph $G$ that cannot form an example

that most effectively represent the actual preference space of the user; and
(ii) a user representation refiner, to effectively fuse together the user

the contribution of the boson hair to the spacetime, as well as relevant
quantities at the horizon, like the surface gravity. The latter indicates to
what extent the hairy solutions approach the extremal limit, noting that for
this kind of solutions the ratio of the angular momentum per squared mass

capture the responses of a floating structure under six different sea state
codes $(3-8)$ based on the wave characteristics described by the World

high-precision neural operators can deliver structural responses more
efficiently, up to two orders of magnitude faster than a dynamic analysis using
conventional numerical solvers. Additionally, compared to gated recurrent units

neural operators are both more accurate and efficient, especially in situations
with limited data availability. To further enhance the accuracy, novel
extensions, such as wavelet-DeepONet and self-adaptive WNO, are proposed. Taken
together, our study shows that FNO outperforms all other operators for
approximating the mapping of one input functional space to the output space as
well as for responses that have small bandwidth of the frequency spectrum,
whereas for learning the mapping of multiple functions in the input space to

size (within a small error term depending on $r$ and $\alpha$). As corollaries
we recover a number of known results about large monochromatic components in
random hypergraphs and random Steiner triple systems, often with drastically
improved bounds on the error terms.
  Gy\'arf\'as' result is equivalent to the dual problem of determining the
smallest maximum degree of an arbitrary $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph with
$n$ edges in which every set of $k$ edges has a common intersection. In this
language, our result says that if one replaces the condition that every set of
$k$ edges has a common intersection with the condition that for every
collection of $k$ disjoint sets $E_1, \dots, E_k\subseteq E(H)$ with
$|E_i|>\alpha$ for all $i\in [k]$ there exists $e_i\in E_i$ for all $i\in [k]$
such that $e_1\cap \dots \cap e_k\neq \emptyset$, then the maximum degree of
$H$ is essentially the same (within a small error term depending on $r$ and
$\alpha$). We prove our results in this dual setting.

This paper provides the first survey concentrated on explainable visual anomaly

across tasks, environments, and objects. However, these methods require large
diverse datasets that are expensive to collect in real-world robotics settings.
For robot learning to generalize, we must be able to leverage sources of data
or priors beyond the robot's own experience. In this work, we posit that
image-text generative models, which are pre-trained on large corpora of
web-scraped data, can serve as such a data source. We show that despite these
generative models being trained on largely non-robotics data, they can serve as
effective ways to impart priors into the process of robot learning in a way
that enables widespread generalization. In particular, we show how pre-trained
generative models can serve as effective tools for semantically meaningful data
augmentation. By leveraging these pre-trained models for generating appropriate
""semantic"" data augmentations, we propose a system GenAug that is able to
significantly improve policy generalization. We apply GenAug to tabletop
manipulation tasks, showing the ability to re-target behavior to novel
scenarios, while only requiring marginal amounts of real-world data. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this system on a number of object manipulation
problems in the real world, showing a 40% improvement in generalization to
novel scenes and objects.

The topological dissimilarity is then measured through the Wasserstein distance

a known distribution, it is challenging to apply existing parametric methods
for statistically quantifying the distance in brain network studies. To address
this problem, we present a unified topological inference framework on the

The method is applied to the resting-state functional magnetic resonance images

luminosities ~10-100 times greater than ordinary core-collapse supernovae. One
popular model to explain the enhanced optical output of hydrogen-poor (Type I)
SLSNe invokes energy injection from a rapidly spinning magnetar. A prediction
in this case is that high-energy gamma rays, generated in the wind nebula of
the magnetar, could escape through the expanding supernova ejecta at late times
(months or more after optical peak). This paper presents a search for gamma-ray
emission in the broad energy band from 100 MeV to 30 TeV from two Type I SLSNe,
SN2015bn, and SN2017egm, using observations from Fermi-LAT and VERITAS.
Although no gamma-ray emission was detected from either source, the derived
upper limits approach the putative magnetar's spin-down luminosity. Prospects
are explored for detecting very-high-energy (VHE; 100 GeV - 100 TeV) emission
from SLSNe-I with existing and planned facilities such as VERITAS and CTA.

total stellar mass and their morphology. Furthermore, the environment is known
to play a strong role in shaping them. The galaxy population in the local
universe that is located in virialized clusters is found to be red, poorly
star-forming, and mostly composed of early morphological types. Towards a
holistic understanding of the mechanisms that drive galaxy evolution, we
exploit the spectrophotometric data from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS local galaxy
cluster surveys, and study the role of both the local and the large-scale
environments. We attempt to disentangle their effects from the intrinsic
characteristics of the galaxies, in shaping the star formation activity at
fixed morphological type and stellar mass. Using a sample of field galaxies
from the same surveys for comparison, we analyse the effects of the
environment, embodied by the local density, clustercentric distance, and close
neighbours, respectively, on the star formation histories of cluster galaxies.
We find that local effects have a more relevant impact on galaxy stellar
properties than the large-scale environment, and that morphology needs to be
taken into account to pinpoint the mechanisms that are driving the influence of
clusters in galaxy evolution.

computational problem for which quantum computing can potentially find
efficient solutions. The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a quantum
algorithm that tackles the molecular groundstate problem and is regarded as one
of the flagships of quantum computing. Yet, to date, only very small molecules
were computed via VQE, due to high noise levels in current quantum devices.
Here we present an alternative variational quantum scheme that requires
significantly less qubits. The reduction in qubit number allows for shallower
circuits to be sufficient, rendering the method more resistant to noise. The
proposed algorithm, termed variational quantum
selected-configuration-interaction (VQ-SCI), is based on: (a) representing the
target groundstate as a superposition of Slater determinant configurations,
encoded directly upon the quantum computational basis states; and (b) selecting
a-priory only the most dominant configurations. This is demonstrated through a
set of groundstate calculations of the H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$, H$_2$O, NH$_3$ and
C$_2$H$_4$ molecules in the sto-3g basis set, performed on IBM quantum devices.
We show that the VQ-SCI reaches the full-CI (FCI) energy within chemical
accuracy using the lowest number of qubits reported to date. Moreover, when the
SCI matrix is generated ``on the fly"", the VQ-SCI requires exponentially less
memory than classical SCI methods. This offers a potential remedy to a severe
memory bottleneck problem in classical SCI calculations. Finally, the proposed
scheme is general and can be straightforwardly applied for finding the
groundstate of any Hermitian matrix, outside the chemical context.

Brownian motion with stochastic resetting to its initial position with rate $r$
and (ii) each particle performs run and tumble motion, and with rate $r$ its
position gets reset to its initial value and simultaneously its velocity gets
randomised. We study the effects of resetting on the distribution $P(Q,t)$ of
the integrated particle current $Q$ up to time $t$ through the origin (from
left to right). We study both the annealed and the quenched current
distributions and in both cases, we find that resetting induces a stationary
limiting distribution of the current at long times. However, we show that the
approach to the stationary state of the current distribution in the annealed
and the quenched cases are drastically different for both models. In the
annealed case, the whole distribution $P_{\rm an}(Q,t)$ approaches its
stationary limit uniformly for all $Q$. In contrast, the quenched distribution
$P_{\rm qu}(Q,t)$ attains its stationary form for $Q<Q_{\rm crit}(t)$, while it

it is required to introduce a belief-dependent constraint. Prompted by this

belief-dependent constrained POMDP. We present a technique to adaptively accept
or discard a candidate action sequence with respect to a probabilistic
belief-dependent constraint, before expanding a complete set of future
observations samples and without any loss in accuracy. Moreover, using our
proposed framework, we contribute an adaptive method to find a maximal feasible
return (e.g., information gain) in terms of Value at Risk for the candidate
action sequence with substantial acceleration. On top of that, we introduce an

Such an approach provably returns an identical-quality solution while

temperature at which fine iron particles can undergo thermal runaway--the
ignition temperature. The model accounts for Knudsen transition transport
effects, which become significant when the particle size is comparable to, or
smaller than, the molecular mean free path of the surrounding gas. Two kinetic
models for the high-temperature solid-phase oxidation of iron are analyzed. The
first model (parabolic kinetics) considers the inhibiting effect of the iron
oxide layers at the particle surface on the rate of oxidation, and a kinetic
rate independent of the gaseous oxidizer concentration. The ignition
temperature is solved as a function of particle size and initial oxide layer
thickness with an unsteady analysis considering the growth of the oxide layers.
In the small-particle limit, the thermal insulating effect of transition heat
transport can lead to a decrease of ignition temperature with decreasing
particle size. However, the presence of the oxide layer slows the reaction
kinetics and its increasing proportion in the small-particle limit can lead to
an increase of ignition temperature with decreasing particle size. This effect
is observed for sufficiently large initial oxide layer thicknesses. The
continuum transport model is shown to predict the ignition temperature of iron
particles exceeding an initial diameter of 30 $\mu$m to a difference of 3% (30
K) or less when compared to the transition transport model. The second kinetic
model (first-order kinetics) considers a porous, non-hindering oxide layer, and
a linear dependence of the kinetic rate of oxidation on the gaseous oxidizer
concentration. The ignition temperature is resolved as a function of particle
size with the transition and continuum transport models, and the differences
between the ignition characteristics predicted by the two models are discussed.

Idealized continuum mechanics based head models provide an attractive approach
for rapidly estimating brain strains and strain rates. These models are capable
of capturing the wave dynamics and transient response of the brain while being
significantly easier and faster to apply compared to more sophisticated and
detailed finite element head models. In this work, we present a new idealized
continuum mechanics based head model that accounts for the head's finite
rotation, which is an improvement upon prior models that have been based on a
small rotation assumption. Despite the simplicity of the model, we show that
the proposed 2D elastic finite rotation head model predicts comparable strains
to a more detailed finite element head model, demonstrating the potential
usefulness of the model in rapidly estimating brain injury risk. This newly
proposed model can serve as a basis for introducing finite rotations into more
sophisticated head models in the future.

that the dynamics of stars and ionised gas are initially coupled. The intrinsic
scatter around the velocity and dispersion relations increases with increasing
stellar age and mass, suggesting that subsequent mechanisms such as internal
processes, divergent star formation and assembly histories also play a role in
setting and altering the dynamics of galaxies. The global (flux-weighted)
dynamical support of older galaxies is hotter than in younger systems. We find
that the ionised gas in galaxies is almost always dynamically colder than the
stars with a steeper velocity gradient. In absolute terms, the local difference
in velocity dispersion is more pronounced than the local difference in
velocity, possibly reflecting inherent differences in the impact of turbulence,
inflow and/or feedback on gas compared to stars. We suggest how these findings
may be taken into account when comparing high and low redshift galaxy samples

attracted a lot of research interests for real-time applications with
information updates. It has been extensively studied for various queueing
models based on the probabilistic approaches, where the analyses heavily depend
on the properties of specific distributions (e.g., the memoryless property of
the exponential distribution or the i.i.d. assumption). In this work, we take
an alternative new approach, the robust queueing approach, to analyze the Peak
Age-of-Information (PAoI). Specifically, we first model the uncertainty in the
stochastic arrival and service processes using uncertainty sets. This enables
us to approximate the expected PAoI performance for very general arrival and
service processes, including those exhibiting heavy-tailed behaviors or
correlations, where traditional probabilistic approaches cannot be applied. We
then derive a new bound on the PAoI in the single-source single-server setting.
Furthermore, we generalize our analysis to two-source single-server systems
with symmetric arrivals, which involves new challenges (e.g., the service times
of the updates from two sources are coupled in one single uncertainty set).
Finally, through numerical experiments, we show that our new bounds provide a
good approximation for the expected PAoI. Compared to some well-known bounds in
the literature (e.g., one based on Kingman's bound under the i.i.d. assumption)
that tends to be inaccurate under light load, our new approximation is accurate
under both light and high loads, both of which are critical scenarios for the
AoI performance.

  hybrid rocket engine",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A computational model is developed to assist the design of the first hybrid
rocket engine of the McGill Rocket Team, using liquid nitrous oxide as an
oxidizer and solid paraffin wax as a fuel. The model is developed in three
phases: In the first phase, a steady-state model which neglects transient
performance decrease of the hybrid engine is considered. The steady-state model
considers: a constant oxidizer mass flow rate; a combustion chamber in chemical
equilibrium; a one-dimensional isentropic nozzle; and a one-dimensional
constant-thrust rocket ascent. The steady-state model is used to conduct
parametric studies on engine performance as a function of design parameters
such as: oxidizer mass flow rate, fuel grain dimensions, and nozzle dimensions.
The engine design point is selected to optimize specific impulse, given
physical and structural constraints of the system. In the second phase, an
unsteady model incorporating transient performance decrease of the hybrid
engine is considered. The transient model considers: a self-pressurizing
oxidizer tank in quasi-steady liquid-vapor equilibrium; a combustion chamber in
quasi-steady chemical equilibrium; a one-dimensional non-isentropic nozzle; and
a one-dimensional rocket ascent model. The transient performance profile of the
engine is established, and the unsteady model is used to predict propellant
requirements for the launch vehicle, given a target apogee of 3048 m (10,000
ft). In the third stage, the unsteady model is compared to hot fire testing
data of the McGill Rocket Team. Semi-empirical parameters used in the
formulation are calibrated against testing data, and the validity of the model
is assessed.

surprisingly strong notions of omniprediction: loss minimization guarantees
that apply not just for a specific loss function, but for any loss belonging to
a large family of losses. While prior work has derived various notions of
omniprediction from multigroup fairness guarantees of varying strength, it was
unknown whether the connection goes in both directions.
  In this work, we answer this question in the affirmative, establishing
equivalences between notions of multicalibration and omniprediction. The new
definitions that hold the key to this equivalence are new notions of swap
omniprediction, which are inspired by swap regret in online learning. We show
that these can be characterized exactly by a strengthening of multicalibration
that we refer to as swap multicalibration. One can go from standard to swap
multicalibration by a simple discretization; moreover all known algorithms for
standard multicalibration in fact give swap multicalibration. In the context of
omniprediction though, introducing the notion of swapping results in provably
stronger notions, which require a predictor to minimize expected loss at least
as well as an adaptive adversary who can choose both the loss function and
hypothesis based on the value predicted by the predictor.
  Building on these characterizations, we paint a complete picture of the
relationship between the various omniprediction notions in the literature by
establishing implications and separations between them. Our work deepens our
understanding of the connections between multigroup fairness, loss minimization
and outcome indistinguishability and establishes new connections to classic
notions in online learning.

learning setting of Flexible Aggregation. Since a WFL round accommodates both
local model training and uploading for each user, the use of Flexible
Aggregation allows the users to train different numbers of iterations per

idea is to use MC-NOMA to concurrently upload the local models of the users,
thereby extending the local model training times of the users and increasing
participating users. A new metric, namely, Weighted Global Proportion of
Trained Mini-batches (WGPTM), is analytically established to measure the
convergence of the new system. Another important aspect is that we maximize the
WGPTM to harness the convergence of the new system by jointly optimizing the
transmit powers and subchannel bandwidths. This nonconvex problem is converted
equivalently to a tractable convex problem and solved efficiently using
variable substitution and Cauchy's inequality. As corroborated experimentally
using a convolutional neural network and an 18-layer residential network, the
proposed MC-NOMA WFL can efficiently reduce communication delay, increase local

a quantum processor. This hybrid algorithm is demonstrated by a quantum

estimating equations with two or more nuisance parameters. In some cases, one
might be able to find a population-level doubly (or possibly multiply) robust
estimating equation which has zero mean provided one of the nuisance parameters
is correctly specified, without knowing which. This property is appealing in
practice because it suggests ""model doubly robust"" estimators that entail extra
protection against model misspecification. Typically asymptotic inference of
such a doubly robust estimator is relatively simple through classical
Z-estimation theory under standard regularity conditions. In other cases,
machine learning techniques are leveraged to achieve ""rate double robustness"",
with cross fitting. However, the classical theory might be insufficient when
all nuisance parameters involve complex time structures and are possibly in the
form of continuous-time stochastic nuisance processes. In such cases, we
caution that extra assumptions are needed, especially on total variation. In
this paper, as an example, we consider a general class of double robust
estimating equations and develop generic assumptions on the asymptotic
properties of the estimators of nuisance parameters such that the resulted
estimator for the parameter of interest is consistent and asymptotically
normal. We illustrate our framework in some examples. We also caution a gap

BLADE uses blankets (i.e., masks on the genetic representation) to tune the
evolutionary operators during the search, and implements the search through
hub-and-spoke distribution. In the paper, (1) the blanket method is formalized
for the (1 + 1)EA case as a Markov chain process. Its effectiveness is then
demonstrated by analyzing dominant and subdominant eigenvalues of stochastic

used to analyze the distribution method; and (3) these insights are verified
experimentally on three benchmark problems, showing that both blankets and
distribution lead to accelerated evolution. Moreover, a surprising synergy

achieves more than $n$-fold speedup with $n$ clients in some cases. The work

experimental data has confirmed theoretical predictions regarding the
dramatically enhanced vacuum field in metallic nanogaps, much fewer studies
have examined the far-field to near-field input coupling. Estimates of this
quantity usually rely on numerical simulations under a plane wave background
field, whereas most experiments employ a strongly focused laser beam. Moreover,
it is often assumed that tuning the laser frequency to that of a particular
cavity mode is a sufficient condition to resonantly excite its near-field.
Here, we experimentally demonstrate selective excitation of nanocavity modes
controlled by the polarization and frequency of the laser beam. We reveal
mode-selectivity by recording fine confocal maps of Raman scattering intensity
excited by cylindrical vector beams, which are compared to the known excitation
near-field patterns. Our measurements allow unambiguous identification of the
transverse vs. longitudinal character of the excited cavity mode, and of their
relative input coupling rates as a function of laser wavelength. The method

neighborhood. This is called the Majority Model (MM) if a node keeps its color
in case of a tie and the Random Majority Model (RMM) if it chooses blue with
probability 1/2 and white otherwise.
  We prove that there are graphs for which RMM needs exponentially many rounds
to reach a stable configuration in expectation, and such a configuration can
have exponentially many states (i.e., colorings). This is in contrast to MM,
which is known to always reach a stable configuration with one or two states in
$O(m)$ rounds. For the special case of a cycle graph C_n, we prove the stronger
and tight bounds of $\lceil n/2\rceil-1$ and $O(n^2)$ in MM and RMM,
respectively. Furthermore, we show that the number of stable colorings in MM on

ratio, while it is equal to 2 for RMM.
  We also study the minimum size of a winning set, which is a set of nodes
whose agreement on a color in the initial coloring enforces the process to end
in a coloring where all nodes share that color. We present tight bounds on the
minimum size of a winning set for both MM and RMM.
  Furthermore, we analyze our models for a random initial coloring, where each
node is colored blue independently with some probability $p$ and white
otherwise. Using some martingale analysis and counting arguments, we prove that
the expected final number of blue nodes is respectively equal to
$(2p^2-p^3)n/(1-p+p^2)$ and pn in MM and RMM on a cycle graph C_n.

ferromagnetism in $\pi/3<\theta<2\pi/3$, which on close inspection is
conjugated to the former phase at smaller $\theta$ by a combined operation of
spin-flip and gauge transformation. Our findings provide insights and direction

this paper, we propose utilizing subsampled double bootstrap and
divide-and-conquer algorithms to conduct statistical mediation analysis on
large-scale datasets. The proposed algorithms offer a significant enhancement

Sobel test, while simultaneously ensuring desirable confidence interval
coverage and power. We conducted extensive numerical simulations to evaluate
the performance of our method. The practical applicability of our approach is

from transaction fees, which relate to the bids that users submit, the
allocation rules that miners use to choose which transactions to include, and
where they choose to mine in the context of longest-chain consensus. We start
by surveying a variety of mining attacks including undercutting, fee sniping,

notions of user incentive compatibility, myopic miner incentive compatibility,
and off-chain-agreement-proofness, as well as why they are provably
incompatible in their full form. Then, we discuss weaker notions of nearly and
$\gamma$-weak incentive compatibility, and how all of these forms of incentive

computation and control components. Combining components of the cyber layer in
one layer complicates the process of modeling intra-actions because each
component has different failure modes. On the other hand, dividing the cyber
layers into a large number of sub-layers may unnecessarily increase the number
of system states and increase the computational burden. In this paper, we
classify system layers based on their common, coupled, and shared functions.
Also, interactions between the classified layers are identified, characterized,
and clustered based on their impact on the system. Furthermore, based on the
overall function of each layer and types of its components, intra-actions
within layers are characterized. The strategies developed in this paper for
comprehensive classification of system layers and characterization of their

required anharmonicity is provided by a simultaneous decay of two atoms (i.e.,
two-atom decay), which is achieved by fully quantum degenerate parametric
amplification. For an atomic ensemble, the two-atom decay generates and
stabilizes a 2D quantum manifold, which is spanned by the ground and
single-excited superradiant states. Moreover, this nonlinear decay process can
strongly suppress transitions to higher-excited superradiant states, and
convert residual transitions into an effective decay from the single-excitation
superradiant state to the ground state. Our method does not require Rydberg
dipole blockade and, thus, strong atom-atom interactions, compared to previous
work. This indicates that it can be applied to typical atomic or spin ensembles
in simple experimental setups. Remarkably, our idea is compatible with the
cavity protection mechanism, and therefore spin dephasing due to inhomogeneous
broadening can be strongly suppressed. The presented ensemble qubit provides a

method may be viewed as a stabilized version of the recently proposed algorithm
PStorm, we call our algorithm S-PStorm. Our analysis shows that S-PStorm has
strong convergence results. In particular, we prove an upper bound on the
number of iterations required by S-PStorm before its iterates correctly
identify (with high probability) an optimal support (i.e., the zero and nonzero
structure of an optimal solution). Most algorithms in the literature with such
a support identification property use variance reduction techniques that
require either periodically evaluating an exact gradient or storing a history
of stochastic gradients. Unlike these methods, S-PStorm achieves variance
reduction without requiring either of these, which is advantageous. Moreover,
our support-identification result for S-PStorm shows that, with high
probability, an optimal support will be identified correctly in all iterations
with the index above a threshold. We believe that this type of result is new to
the literature since the few existing other results prove that the optimal
support is identified with high probability at each iteration with a
sufficiently large index (meaning that the optimal support might be identified
in some iterations, but not in others). Numerical experiments on regularized
logistic loss problems show that S-PStorm outperforms existing methods in
various metrics that measure how efficiently and robustly iterates of an
algorithm identify an optimal support.

their spectra above $\sim 5\,{\rm EeV}$, that they are strongly suppressed
above energies $\sim50\,{\rm EeV}$, and that the only significant departure
from isotropy is a dipole. Constraints based upon photopion and
photodisintegration losses allow their ranges and luminosity density to be

the open and closed states of channels. This provides valuable information on
the gating kinetics of ion channels. However, the idealization step is often
challenging in cases of currents with poor signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and
baseline drifts, especially when the gating model of the target channel is not

for achieving this goal. The algorithm, called AI2 (Adaptive Integrated
Approach for the Idealization of Ion Channel Currents), is composed of Kalman
filter and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering and functions without user

thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch between TeNFs and growth substrates by
maintaining a high-pressure enforced non-slip condition during thermal
relaxation (623 to 300K) to achieve the optimal biaxial compressive strain of
-4.6 percent in TeNFs/sapphire. This resulted in an enormous bandgap modulation
of 2.3 eV, at a rate of up to ~600 meV/%, which is two-fold larger than
reported modulation rate. Strained TeNFs display robust band-to-band radiative
excitonic blue photoemission with an intrinsic quantum efficiency (IQE) of c.a.
79.9%, making it promising for energy efficient blue LEDs and nanolasers.
Computational studies reveal that biaxial compressive strain inhibits
exciton-exciton annihilation by evading van-Hove singularities, hence promoting
radiative-recombination. Bandgap modulation by such nonvolatile straining is
scalable to other 2D semiconductors for on-demand nano(opto)-electronics.

two issues, this paper proposes a novel method to estimate these three CMs by
the so-called quantiled CMs (QCMs). The QCM method first adopts the idea of
Cornish-Fisher expansion to construct a linear regression model, based on $n$
different estimated conditional quantiles. Next, it computes the QCMs simply
and simultaneously by using the ordinary least squares estimator of this
regression model, without any prior estimation of the conditional mean. Under
certain conditions, the QCMs are shown to be consistent with the convergence
rate $n^{-1/2}$. Simulation studies indicate that the QCMs perform well under
different scenarios of Cornish-Fisher expansion errors and quantile estimation
errors. In the application, the study of QCMs for three exchange rates
demonstrates the effectiveness of financial rescue plans during the COVID-19

compound rules and randomization even in the large-sample limit. A data-driven
version of the oracle rule is proposed and shown to outperform existing
methodologies on simulated data for models as simple as the normal mean model.
Finally, to address the limitation of the FDR and FNR which only control the
expectations but not the fluctuations of the FDP and FNP, we also determine the
optimal tradeoff when the FDP and FNP are controlled with high probability and
show it coincides with that of the mFDR and the mFNR.

can easily memorize inaccurate labels, leading to poor generalization ability.
Recently, the meta-learning based label correction strategy is widely adopted
to tackle this problem via identifying and correcting potential noisy labels
with the help of a small set of clean validation data. Although training with
purified labels can effectively improve performance, solving the meta-learning
problem inevitably involves a nested loop of bi-level optimization between
model weights and hyper-parameters (i.e., label distribution). As compromise,
previous methods resort to a coupled learning process with alternating update.
In this paper, we empirically find such simultaneous optimization over both
model weights and label distribution can not achieve an optimal routine,
consequently limiting the representation ability of backbone and accuracy of
corrected labels. From this observation, a novel multi-stage label purifier
named DMLP is proposed. DMLP decouples the label correction process into
label-free representation learning and a simple meta label purifier. In this
way, DMLP can focus on extracting discriminative feature and label correction
in two distinctive stages. DMLP is a plug-and-play label purifier, the purified
labels can be directly reused in naive end-to-end network retraining or other
robust learning methods, where state-of-the-art results are obtained on several
synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, especially under high noise levels.

solution for REBCO coated conductors to form a fully transposed high current

operating current as high as tens of kiloamperes. The stacked REBCO tapes, no
matter whether they are twisted or not, however, have a nature of
non-transposing and therefore could result in current unbalance. In this
manuscript, the current unbalance and the related electrical characteristics of
a cable made of 40 stacked REBCO tapes are studied with an electrical circuit
simulation. The differences in splice resistances and tape inductances that are
both related to the non-transposed structure of a REBCO stack are considered.
Results show that for a 40 cm long termination, a proper method to keep the
contact resistivity between each tape and the copper termination around 1e-8
ohmm is crucial to totally avoid current unbalance lowering the cable
performance. Surprisingly, the inter-tape current transfer is found to be able
to further exacerbate local high current though it does make the overall
distribution more balanced. The inductance difference induced current unbalance
is only important if local defects exist at long REBCO tapes, which on the
other hand can be cured by good inter-tape current transfer. For a
fast-charging rate of 1 kA/s, the inter-tape contact resistivity should also be
low to a level of 1e-8 ohmm to ensure a short current transfer length of around
1 m.

using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group formalism and show
how the scale invariant fixed point emerges as a local theory. The local
low-energy effective field theory for Fermi liquids includes not only the
forward scatterings but also non-forward scatterings with small but non-zero
momentum transfers. In the low-energy limit, the non-forward scattering
amplitude takes a scale invariant form if the momentum transfer is scaled along
with the energy. If the bare coupling is attractive beyond a critical strength,
the coupling function exhibits a run-away flow, signifying potential
instabilities in particle-hole channels. What drives those instabilities is the
non-trivial renormalization group flow of the non-forward scattering
amplitudes. The pairing interaction also obeys a scaling relation if the center
of mass momentum of Cooper pairs is comparable with energy.

to transform the bilevel program into a single-level optimization problem. The
most popular approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT

program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC for short). However, since the MPEC
does not satisfy the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification at any
feasible point, the well-developed nonlinear programming theory cannot be
applied to MPECs directly. In this paper, we apply the Wolfe duality to show
that, under very mild conditions, the bilevel program is equivalent to a new

oscillators on various natural and artificial networks, which can remain
undetected due to the complexity of the systems. With an analogy between
pairwise asynchrony of oscillators and topological defects, i.e., vortices, in
the two-dimensional XY spin model, we propose a robust and data-driven method
to identify the partial synchronization on complex networks. The proposed
method is based on an integer matrix whose element is pseudo-vorticity that
discretely quantifies asynchronous phase dynamics in every two oscillators,
which results in graphical and entropic representations of partial synchrony.
As a first trial, we apply our method to 200 FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons on a
complex small-world network. Partially synchronized chimera states are revealed
by discriminating synchronized states even with phase lags. Such phase lags
also appear in partial synchronization in chimera states. Our topological,
graphical, and entropic method is implemented solely with measurable phase

oscillatory networks including neural networks in the brain.

power loads during the thermal quench phase of tokamak disruptions are
numerically investigated with BOUT++'s flux-driven, six-field electromagnetic
turbulence model. Here a transient yet intense particle and energy sources are
applied at the pedestal top to mimic the plasma power drive at the edge induced
by a core thermal collapse, which flattens core temperature profile.
Interesting features such as surging of divertor heat load (up to 50 times),
and broadening of heat flux width (up to 4 times) on the outer divertor target
plate, are observed in the simulation, in qualitative agreement with
experimental observations. The dramatic changes of divertor heat load and width
are due to the enhanced plasma turbulence activities inside the separatrix. Two
cross-field transport mechanisms, namely the $E\times B$ turbulent convection
and the stochastic parallel advection/conduction, are identified to play
important roles in this process. Firstly, elevated edge pressure gradient
drives instabilities and subsequent turbulence in the entire pedestal region.
The enhanced turbulence not only transports particles and energy radially
across the separatrix via $E\times B$ convection which causes the initial
divertor heat load burst, but also induces an amplified magnetic fluctuation
$\tilde{B}$. Once the magnetic fluctuation is large enough to break the
magnetic flux surface, magnetic flutter effect provides an additional radial
transport channel. In the late stage of our simulation, $|\tilde{B}_r/B_0|$
reaches to $10^{-4}$ level that completely breaks magnetic flux surfaces such
that stochastic field-lines are directly connecting pedestal top plasma to the
divertor target plates or first wall, further contributing to the divertor heat
flux width broadening.

Instead of obtaining features from language models, we propose BLIAM, a

points that are interpretable and model-agnostic to downstream applications.
The key idea of BLIAM is to create prompts using existing training data and
then use these prompts to synthesize new data points. BLIAM performs these two
steps iteratively as new data points will define more informative prompts and
new prompts will in turn synthesize more accurate data points. Notably,
literature-based data augmentation might introduce data leakage since labels of
test data points in downstream applications might have already been mentioned

outperforms a non-augmented approach and manual prompting in this rigorous data
split setting. BLIAM can be further used to synthesize data points for novel

point around which interesting phenomena tend to cluster. At low temperatures,
the intrinsic behavior in this regime is often obscured by charge inhomogeneity

create electron-hole plasma of Dirac fermions. The Dirac plasma has been found
to exhibit unusual properties including quantum critical scattering and
hydrodynamic flow. However, little is known about the plasma's behavior in
magnetic fields. Here we report magnetotransport in this quantum-critical

higher than magnetoresistivity found in any other system at such temperatures.
We show that this behavior is unique to monolayer graphene, being underpinned
by its massless spectrum and ultrahigh mobility, despite frequent
(Planckian-limit) scattering. With the onset of Landau quantization in a few T,
where the electron-hole plasma resides entirely on the zeroth Landau level,
giant linear magnetoresistivity emerges. It is nearly independent of

engineering. Problems such as deciding the satisfiability of the FM and
eliminating inconsistent parts of the FM have been well resolved by translating
the FM into a conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula, and then feeding the CNF
to a SAT solver. However, this approach has some limits for other important
reasoning issues about the FM, such as counting or enumerating configurations.
Two mainstream approaches have been investigated in this direction: (i) direct
approaches, using tools based on the CNF representation of the FM at hand, or
(ii) compilation-based approaches, where the CNF representation of the FM has
first been translated into another representation for which the reasoning
queries are easier to address. Our contribution is twofold. First, we evaluate
how both approaches compare when dealing with common reasoning operations on
FM, namely counting configurations, pointing out one or several configurations,
sampling configurations, and finding optimal configurations regarding a utility
function. Our experimental results show that the compilation-based is efficient
enough to possibly compete with the direct approaches and that the cost of
translation (i.e., the compilation time) can be balanced when addressing
sufficiently many complex reasoning operations on large configuration spaces.
Second, we provide a Java-based automated reasoner that supports these
operations for both approaches, thus eliminating the burden of selecting the

  Computation for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","This paper is accepted by aamas 2023",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Real-world cooperation often requires intensive coordination among agents
simultaneously. This task has been extensively studied within the framework of
cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), and value decomposition
methods are among those cutting-edge solutions. However, traditional methods
that learn the value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent utilities
cannot solve the tasks with non-monotonic returns. This hinders their
application in generic scenarios. Recent methods tackle this problem from the
perspective of implicit credit assignment by learning value functions with
complete expressiveness or using additional structures to improve cooperation.
However, they are either difficult to learn due to large joint action spaces or
insufficient to capture the complicated interactions among agents which are
essential to solving tasks with non-monotonic returns. To address these
problems, we propose a novel explicit credit assignment method to address the
non-monotonic problem. Our method, Adaptive Value decomposition with Greedy
Marginal contribution (AVGM), is based on an adaptive value decomposition that
learns the cooperative value of a group of dynamically changing agents. We
first illustrate that the proposed value decomposition can consider the
complicated interactions among agents and is feasible to learn in large-scale
scenarios. Then, our method uses a greedy marginal contribution computed from
the value decomposition as an individual credit to incentivize agents to learn
the optimal cooperative policy. We further extend the module with an action
encoder to guarantee the linear time complexity for computing the greedy
marginal contribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant performance improvements in several non-monotonic domains.

cost-based query optimizers in DBMS. While exhibiting superiority in some
benchmarks, their deficiencies, e.g., unstable performance, high training cost,
and slow model updating, stem from the inherent hardness of predicting the cost
or latency of execution plans using machine learning models. In this paper, we
introduce a learning-to-rank query optimizer, called Lero, which builds on top
of a native query optimizer and continuously learns to improve the optimization
performance. The key observation is that the relative order or rank of plans,
rather than the exact cost or latency, is sufficient for query optimization.
Lero employs a pairwise approach to train a classifier to compare any two plans
and tell which one is better. Such a binary classification task is much easier
than the regression task to predict the cost or latency, in terms of model
efficiency and accuracy. Rather than building a learned optimizer from scratch,
Lero is designed to leverage decades of wisdom of databases and improve the
native query optimizer. With its non-intrusive design, Lero can be implemented
on top of any existing DBMS with minimal integration efforts. We implement Lero
and demonstrate its outstanding performance using PostgreSQL. In our
experiments, Lero achieves near optimal performance on several benchmarks. It
reduces the plan execution time of the native optimizer in PostgreSQL by up to
70% and other learned query optimizers by up to 37%. Meanwhile, Lero
continuously learns and automatically adapts to query workloads and changes in

and published experimental comparisons become inconsistent and
self-contradictory, i.e., the reported AUC scores of DKT on ASSISTments2009
range from 0.721 to 0.821 \citep{minn2018deep,yeung2018addressing}. Therefore,
in this paper, we provide a strong but simple baseline method to deal with the
KT task named \textsc{simpleKT}. Inspired by the Rasch model in psychometrics,
we explicitly model question-specific variations to capture the individual
differences among questions covering the same set of knowledge components that
are a generalization of terms of concepts or skills needed for learners to
accomplish steps in a task or a problem. Furthermore, instead of using
sophisticated representations to capture student forgetting behaviors, we use
the ordinary dot-product attention function to extract the time-aware

conditions for thermal creep to occur in natural soil only exist on this planet
in the solar system. Known as Knudsen compressor, thermal creep induces
pressure variations. In the case of Mars, there might be a pressure maximum
below the very top dust particle layers of the soil, which would support
particle lift and might decrease threshold wind velocities necessary to trigger
saltation or reduce angles of repose on certain slopes. In laboratory
experiments, we applied diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) to trace minute
motions of grains on the nm-scale in an illuminated simulated soil. This way,
DWS visualizes pressure variations. We observe a minimum of motion which we
attribute to the pressure maximum ~ 2 mm below the surface. The motion above
but especially below that depth characteristically depends on the ambient
pressure with a peak at an ambient pressure of about 3 mbar for our sample.
This is consistent with earlier work on ejection of particle layers and is in
agreement to a thermal creep origin. It underlines the supporting nature of
thermal creep for particle lift which might be especially important on Mars.

running time on 2-dimensional Euclidean instances was known so far. We clarify
this issue by presenting, for every $p\in\mathbb{N}$, a family of $L_p$
instances on which 2-Opt can take an exponential number of steps.
  Previous probabilistic analyses were restricted to instances in which $n$
points are placed uniformly at random in the unit square $[0,1]^2$. We consider
a more advanced model in which the points can be placed independently according
to general distributions on $[0,1]^d$, for an arbitrary $d\ge 2$. In
particular, we allow different distributions for different points. We study the
expected number of local improvements in terms of the number $n$ of points and
the maximal density $\phi$ of the probability distributions. We show an upper
bound on the expected length of any 2-Opt improvement path of
$\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. When starting with an initial tour
computed by an insertion heuristic, the upper bound on the expected number of
steps improves even to $\tilde{O}(n^{4+1/3-1/d}\cdot\phi^{8/3})$. If the
distances are measured according to the Manhattan metric, then the expected
number of steps is bounded by $\tilde{O}(n^{4-1/d}\cdot\phi)$. In addition, we
prove an upper bound of $O(\sqrt[d]{\phi})$ on the expected approximation
factor with respect to all $L_p$ metrics.
  Let us remark that our probabilistic analysis covers as special cases the
uniform input model with $\phi=1$ and a smoothed analysis with Gaussian
perturbations of standard deviation $\sigma$ with $\phi\sim1/\sigma^d$.

autonomous systems. The robot itself may hide targets of interest from the
camera, while it moves within the field of view, leading to failures in task
execution. For example, if a target of interest is partially occluded by the
robot, detecting and grasping it correctly, becomes very challenging. To solve
this problem, we propose a computationally lightweight method to determine the
areas that the robot occludes. For this purpose, we use the Unified Robot
Description Format (URDF) to generate a virtual depth image of the 3D robot
model. Using the virtual depth image, we can effectively determine the
partially occluded areas to improve the robustness of the information given by
the perception system. Due to the real-time capabilities of the method, it can
successfully detect occlusions of moving targets by the moving robot. We
validate the effectiveness of the method in an experimental setup using a 6-DoF
robot arm and an RGB-D camera by detecting and handling occlusions for two
tasks: Pose estimation of a moving object for pickup and human tracking for
robot handover. The code is available in

a possibility to avoid collisions. This work introduces a tool for the analysis
of aerodynamic collision avoidance manoeuvres. Current space-weather data are
employed to estimate the density the satellite encounters. Achievable in-track
separation distances following a variation of the ballistic coefficient through
a change in attitude are then derived by evaluating an analytical equation from
literature. Considering additional constraints for the attitude, e.g., charging
phases, and uncertainties in the used parameters, the influence of a manoeuvre
on the conjunction geometry and the collision probability is examined. The

multiple-output (MIMO) introduces dramatic capacity improvements along with
very high beamforming and spatial multiplexing gains. When developing efficient
physical layer algorithms for massive MIMO systems, message passing is one
promising candidate owing to the superior performance. However, as their
computational complexity increases dramatically with the problem size, the
state-of-the-art message passing algorithms cannot be directly applied to
future 6G systems, where an exceedingly large number of antennas are expected
to be deployed. To address this issue, we propose a model-driven deep learning
(DL) framework, namely the AMP-GNN for massive MIMO transceiver design, by
considering the low complexity of the AMP algorithm and adaptability of GNNs.
Specifically, the structure of the AMP-GNN network is customized by unfolding
the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm and introducing a graph neural
network (GNN) module into it. The permutation equivariance property of AMP-GNN
is proved, which enables the AMP-GNN to learn more efficiently and to adapt to
different numbers of users. We also reveal the underlying reason why GNNs
improve the AMP algorithm from the perspective of expectation propagation,
which motivates us to amalgamate various GNNs with different message passing
algorithms. In the simulation, we take the massive MIMO detection to exemplify
that the proposed AMP-GNN significantly improves the performance of the AMP
detector, achieves comparable performance as the state-of-the-art DL-based MIMO
detectors, and presents strong robustness to various mismatches.

problem due to the large movements between the camera and the scene. Although
some works apply segmentation maps on human face images for deblurring, they
cannot handle natural scenes because objects and degradation are more complex,
and inaccurate segmentation maps lead to a loss of details. For general scene
deblurring, the feature space of the blurry image and corresponding sharp image
under the high-level vision task is closer, which inspires us to rely on other
tasks (e.g. classification) to learn a comprehensive prior in severe blur
removal cases. We propose a cross-level feature learning strategy based on
knowledge distillation to learn the priors, which include global contexts and
sharp local structures for recovering potential details. In addition, we
propose a semantic prior embedding layer with multi-level aggregation and
semantic attention transformation to integrate the priors effectively. We
introduce the proposed priors to various models, including the UNet and other
mainstream deblurring baselines, leading to better performance on severe blur
removal. Extensive experiments on natural image deblurring benchmarks and
real-world images, such as GoPro and RealBlur datasets, demonstrate our

to undesirable social effects. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in bot detection since they can effectively
utilize user interaction. In most scenarios, the distribution of bots and
humans is imbalanced, resulting in under-represent minority class samples and
sub-optimal performance. However, previous GNN-based methods for bot detection
seldom consider the impact of class-imbalanced issues. In this paper, we
propose an over-sampling strategy for GNN (OS-GNN) that can mitigate the effect
of class imbalance in bot detection. Compared with previous over-sampling
methods for GNNs, OS-GNN does not call for edge synthesis, eliminating the
noise inevitably introduced during the edge construction. Specifically, node
features are first mapped to a feature space through neighborhood aggregation
and then generated samples for the minority class in the feature space.
Finally, the augmented features are fed into GNNs to train the classifiers.
This framework is general and can be easily extended into different GNN
architectures. The proposed framework is evaluated using three real-world bot
detection benchmark datasets, and it consistently exhibits superiority over the
baselines.

rooted in the different mechanisms of stellar dynamics, such as rotation,

lower clustering for HADS than non-HADS indicates a more straightforward light

to small adversarial noise in observations. Such adversarial noise can have
disastrous consequences in safety-critical environments. For instance, a
self-driving car receiving adversarially perturbed sensory observations about
nearby signs (e.g., a stop sign physically altered to be perceived as a speed
limit sign) or objects (e.g., cars altered to be recognized as trees) can be
fatal. Existing approaches for making RL algorithms robust to an
observation-perturbing adversary have focused on reactive approaches that
iteratively improve against adversarial examples generated at each iteration.
While such approaches have been shown to provide improvements over regular RL
methods, they are reactive and can fare significantly worse if certain
categories of adversarial examples are not generated during training. To that
end, we pursue a more proactive approach that relies on directly optimizing a
well-studied robustness measure, regret instead of expected value. We provide a
principled approach that minimizes maximum regret over a ""neighborhood"" of
observations to the received ""observation"". Our regret criterion can be used to
modify existing value- and policy-based Deep RL methods. We demonstrate that
our approaches provide a significant improvement in performance across a wide
variety of benchmarks against leading approaches for robust Deep RL.

  arXiv:2207.02918",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Prompt and accurate detection of system anomalies is essential to ensure the
reliability of software systems. Unlike manual efforts that exploit all
available run-time information, existing approaches usually leverage only a
single type of monitoring data (often logs or metrics) or fail to make
effective use of the joint information among different types of data.
Consequently, many false predictions occur. To better understand the
manifestations of system anomalies, we conduct a systematical study on a large
amount of heterogeneous data, i.e., logs and metrics. Our study demonstrates
that logs and metrics can manifest system anomalies collaboratively and
complementarily, and neither of them only is sufficient. Thus, integrating
heterogeneous data can help recover the complete picture of a system's health
status. In this context, we propose Hades, the first end-to-end semi-supervised
approach to effectively identify system anomalies based on heterogeneous data.
Our approach employs a hierarchical architecture to learn a global
representation of the system status by fusing log semantics and metric
patterns. It captures discriminative features and meaningful interactions from
heterogeneous data via a cross-modal attention module, trained in a
semi-supervised manner. We evaluate Hades extensively on large-scale simulated
data and datasets from Huawei Cloud. The experimental results present the
effectiveness of our model in detecting system anomalies. We also release the
code and the annotated dataset for replication and future research.

censorship in the context of classical algorithms designed for uncensored

of censorship models and their analysis in terms of the effective dimension of
the problem -- a natural measure of its underlying statistical complexity and
main driver of the regret bound. In particular, the effective dimension allows
us to maintain the structure of the original problem at first order, while
embedding it in a bigger space, and thus naturally leads to results analogous
to uncensored settings. Our analysis involves a continuous generalization of
the Elliptical Potential Inequality, which we believe is of independent
interest. We also discover an interesting property of decision-making under
censorship: a transient phase during which initial misspecification of
censorship is self-corrected at an extra cost, followed by a stationary phase
that reflects the inherent slowdown of learning governed by the effective
dimension. Our results are useful for applications of sequential
decision-making models where the feedback received depends on strategic
uncertainty (e.g., agents' willingness to follow a recommendation) and/or
random uncertainty (e.g., loss or delay in arrival of information).

increased by more than 100% from \$700 million during the 2017-2018 U.S.
election cycle to \$1.6 billion during the 2020 U.S. presidential elections.
Naturally, the capacity offered by online platforms to micro-target ads with
political content has been worrying lawmakers, journalists, and online
platforms, especially after the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where
Cambridge Analytica has targeted voters with political ads congruent with their
personality
  To curb such risks, both online platforms and regulators (through the DSA act
proposed by the European Commission) have agreed that researchers, journalists,
and civil society need to be able to scrutinize the political ads running on
large online platforms. Consequently, online platforms such as Meta and Google
have implemented Ad Libraries that contain information about all political ads
running on their platforms. This is the first step on a long path. Due to the
volume of available data, it is impossible to go through these ads manually,
and we now need automated methods and tools to assist in the scrutiny of
political ads.
  In this paper, we focus on political ads that are related to policy.
Understanding which policies politicians or organizations promote and to whom
is essential in determining dishonest representations. This paper proposes
automated methods based on pre-trained models to classify ads in 14 main policy
groups identified by the Comparative Agenda Project (CAP). We discuss several
inherent challenges that arise. Finally, we analyze policy-related ads featured

multitude of spacecraft will flow in the future decades under the propulsive

standard radiometric tracking. The adoption of autonomous navigation
alternatives is crucial to overcoming these limitations. Among these, optical
navigation is an affordable and fully ground-independent approach. Probes can
triangulate their position by observing visible beacons, e.g., planets or
asteroids, by acquiring their line-of-sight in deep space. To do so, developing
efficient and robust image processing algorithms providing information to
navigation filters is a necessary action. This paper proposes an innovative
pipeline for unresolved beacon recognition and line-of-sight extraction from
images for autonomous interplanetary navigation. The developed algorithm
exploits the k-vector method for the non-stellar object identification and
statistical likelihood to detect whether any beacon projection is visible in
the image. Statistical results show that the accuracy in detecting the planet
position projection is independent of the spacecraft position uncertainty.
Whereas, the planet detection success rate is higher than 95% when the
spacecraft position is known with a 3sigma accuracy up to 10^5 km.

physical and thermal properties of individual objects, and for the
understanding of the small-body populations in the solar system as a whole. But
standard radiometric methods can only be applied if the orbit of an object is
known, hence its position at the time of the observation. We present MIRI
observations of the outer-belt asteroid 10920 and an unknown object, detected
in all 9 MIRI bands in close proximity to 10920. We developed a new method
""STM-ORBIT"" to interpret the multi-band measurements without knowing the
object's true location. The method leads to a confirmation of radiometric
size-albedo solution for 10920 and puts constraints on the asteroid's location
and orbit in agreement with its true orbit. Groundbased lightcurve observations
of 10920, combined with Gaia data, indicate a very elongated object (a/b >=
1.5), with a spin-pole at (l, b) = (178{\deg}, 81{\deg}), and a rotation period
of 4.861191 h. A thermophysical study leads to a size of 14.5 - 16.5 km, a
geometric albedo between 0.05 and 0.10, and a thermal inertia in the range 9 to
35 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. For the newly discovered MIRI object, the STM-ORBIT method
revealed a size of 100-230 m. The new asteroid must be on a very
low-inclination orbit and it was located in the inner main-belt region during
JWST observations. A beaming parameter {\eta} larger than 1.0 would push the
size even below 100 meter, a main-belt regime which escaped IR detections so
far. These kind of MIRI observations can therefore contribute to formation and
evolution studies via classical size-frequency studies which are currently
limited to objects larger than about one kilometer in size. We estimate that
MIRI frames with pointings close to the ecliptic and only short integration
times of a few seconds will always include a few asteroids, most of them will

be a severe threat to real-world systems. In VFI attacks, the adversary
disturbs the power-supply of the target-device forcing the device to
illegitimate behavior. Various countermeasures have been proposed to address
different types of fault injection attacks at different abstraction layers,
either requiring to modify the underlying hardware or software/firmware at the
machine instruction level. Moreover, only recently, individual chip
manufacturers have started to respond to this threat by integrating
countermeasures in their products. Generally, these countermeasures aim at
protecting against single fault injection (SFI) attacks, since Multiple Fault
Injection (MFI) is believed to be challenging and sometimes even impractical.
In this paper, we present {\mu}-Glitch, the first Voltage Fault Injection (VFI)
platform which is capable of injecting multiple, coordinated voltage faults
into a target device, requiring only a single trigger signal. We provide a
novel flow for Multiple Voltage Fault Injection (MVFI) attacks to significantly
reduce the search complexity for fault parameters, as the search space
increases exponentially with each additional fault injection. We evaluate and
showcase the effectiveness and practicality of our attack platform on four
real-world chips, featuring TrustZone-M: The first two have interdependent
backchecking mechanisms, while the second two have additionally integrated
countermeasures against fault injection. Our evaluation revealed that
{\mu}-Glitch can successfully inject four consecutive faults within an average
time of one day. Finally, we discuss potential countermeasures to mitigate VFI
attacks and additionally propose two novel attack scenarios for MVFI.

Building applications on top of such a decentralized Knowledge Graph involves

techniques cannot handle this large scale of distribution at the expected
performance. We propose an extension to Link Traversal Query Processing (LTQP)

tackle their unprecedented scale. In this article, we analyze the structural
properties of the Solid decentralization ecosystem that are relevant for query

representatively. We introduce novel LTQP algorithms leveraging these
structural properties, and evaluate their effectiveness. Our experiments
indicate that these new algorithms obtain accurate results in the order of

Furthermore, we discuss limitations with respect to more complex queries. This
work reveals that a traversal-based querying method using structural

advances are needed in the area of query planning for LTQP to handle more
complex queries. These insights open the door to query-driven decentralized

studies is the fragility curve, which represents the probability of failure of
a mechanical structure conditional to a scalar measure derived from the seismic
ground motion. Estimating such curves is a difficult task because for most
structures of interest, few data are available, whether they come from complex
numerical simulations or experimental campaigns. For this reason, a wide range
of the methods of the literature rely on a parametric log-normal model.
Bayesian approaches allow for efficient learning of the model parameters.
However, for small data set sizes, the choice of the prior distribution has a
non-negligible influence on the posterior distribution, and therefore on any
resulting estimate. We propose a thorough study of this parametric Bayesian
estimation problem when the data are binary (i.e. data indicate the state of
the structure, failure or non-failure). Using the reference prior theory as a
support, we suggest an objective approach for the prior choice to simulate a
posteriori fragility curves. This approach leads to the Jeffreys prior and we
prove that this prior depends only of the ground motion characteristics, making
its calculation suitable for any equipment in an industrial installation
subjected to the same seismic hazard. Our proposal is theoretically and
numerically compared to those classically proposed in the literature by
considering three different case studies. The results show the robustness and
advantages of the Jeffreys prior in terms of regularization (no degenerate
estimations) and stability (no outliers of the parameters) for fragility curves
estimation.

The properties of these systems are typically measured from individual quasar
spectra redward of the quasar's Ly $\alpha$ emission line, yet that approach
may provide biased results due to selection effects. We present an alternative
approach to measure these properties in an unbiased manner with the two-point
statistics commonly employed to quantify large-scale structure. Our model
treats the observed flux of a large sample of quasar spectra as a continuous
field and describes the one-dimensional, two-point statistics of this field
with three parameters per ion: the abundance (column density distribution),
temperature (Doppler parameter) and clustering (cloud-cloud correlation
function). We demonstrate this approach on multiple ions (e.g., C IV, Si IV, Mg
II) with early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and
high-resolution spectra from the literature. Our initial results show some
evidence that the C IV abundance is higher than previous measurements and
evidence for abundance evolution over time. The first full year of DESI
observations will have over an order of magnitude more quasar spectra than this
study. In a future paper we will use those data to measure the growth of
clustering and its impact on the Ly $\alpha$ forest, as well as test other DESI

collisions.
  Purpose: To investigate quasifission mechanisms in five different reactions
forming $^{294}$Og as a compound nucleus and compare quasifission trajectories
with predicted fission modes.
  Methods: The potential energy surface (PES) of $^{294}$Og is calculated using
the static Hartree-Fock approach with BCS pairing correlations. Quasifission
trajectories for central collisions at various energies are studied with the
time-dependent Hartree-Fock theory.
  Results: The exit channel strongly depends on initial mass asymmetry and
orientation, but it only exhibits small dependences in the reaction energy. The
$^{48}$Ca$+^{246}$Cf reaction is affected by the PES topology, leading to
either fusion or asymmetric fission. Spherical shell effects associated with
the $Z=50$ magic gap hinder charge and mass equilibrations in
$^{126}$Sn$+^{168}$Er, resulting in large total kinetic energies and compact
scission configurations.
  Conclusions: Quasifission trajectories can be interpreted in terms of the

However, conventional underwater target detection methods face several
challenges such as inaccurate feature extraction, slow detection speed and lack

this study proposes an improved YOLOv7 network (YOLOv7-AC) for underwater
target detection. The proposed network utilizes an ACmixBlock module to replace
the 3x3 convolution block in the E-ELAN structure, and incorporates jump
connections and 1x1 convolution architecture between ACmixBlock modules to
improve feature extraction and network reasoning speed. Additionally, a
ResNet-ACmix module is designed to avoid feature information loss and reduce
computation, while a Global Attention Mechanism (GAM) is inserted in the
backbone and head parts of the model to improve feature extraction.
Furthermore, the K-means++ algorithm is used instead of K-means to obtain
anchor boxes and enhance model accuracy. Experimental results show that the
improved YOLOv7 network outperforms the original YOLOv7 model and other popular
underwater target detection methods. The proposed network achieved a mean
average precision (mAP) value of 89.6% and 97.4% on the URPC dataset and
Brackish dataset, respectively, and demonstrated a higher frame per second

state-of-the-art photonic devices. Typically used, bulky, multi-layered
distributed Bragg (DBR) reflectors are limited to lattice-matched
semiconductors or nonconductive dielectrics. Here, we introduce an inverted
refractive-index-contrast grating (ICG), as compact, single layer alternative
to DBR. In the ICG, a subwavelength one-dimensional grating made of a low
refractive index material is implemented on a high refractive index cladding.
Our numerical simulations show that the ICG provides nearly total optical power
reflectance for the light incident from the side of the cladding whenever the
refractive index of the grating exceeds 1.75, irrespective of the refractive
index of the cladding. Additionally, the ICG enables polarization
discrimination and phase tuning of the reflected and transmitted light, the
property not achievable with the DBR. We experimentally demonstrate a
proof-of-concept ICG fabricated according to the proposed design, using the
technique of 3D microprinting in which thin stripes of IP-Dip photoresist are
deposited on a Si cladding. This one-step method avoids laborious and often
destructive etching-based procedures for grating structuration, making it
possible to implement the grating on any arbitrary cladding material.

on evaluating the performance of a diverse set of algorithms and methodologies
to achieve the task of classifying BOSCH automotive domain textual software

the Min-Max Optimal algorithm, for heterogeneous edge resource allocation.
These mechanisms operate in real-time and do not require prior knowledge of

radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. This study involves heterogeneous samples of nearby
Seyfert and LINER galaxies as well as QSOs that have been observed at low radio
frequencies (few ~100 MHz) with the GMRT and ~GHz frequencies with the VLA and
VLBA. These multi-frequency, multi-resolution observations detect a range of
arcsecond-scale radio spectral indices that are consistent with the presence of
multiple contributors including starburst winds and AGN jets or winds; steep
spectrum ``relic'' emission is observed as well. Polarization-sensitive data
from the VLA and GMRT suggest that the radio outflows are stratified (e.g., in
IIIZw2, Mrk231); distinct polarization signatures suggest that there could
either be a ``spine + sheath'' structure in the radio outflow, or there could
be a ``jet + wind'' structure. Similar nested biconical outflows can also
explain the VLBA and SDSS emission-line data in the KISSR sample of
double-peaked emission-line Seyfert and LINER galaxies. Furthermore, the
modeling of the emission-lines with plasma modeling codes such as MAPPINGS
indicates that parsec-scale jets and winds in these sources can disturb or move
the narrow-line region gas clouds via the ``shock + precursor'' mechanism.
Apart from the presence of ``relic'' emission, several Seyfert and LINER
galaxies show clear morphological signatures of episodic jet activity. In one
such source, NGC2639, at least four distinct episodes of jets are observed, the
largest one of which was only detectable at 735 MHz with the GMRT.
Additionally, a ~6 kpc hole in the CO molecular gas along with a dearth of
young stars in the center of its host galaxy is observed. This suggests a link
between episodic jet activity in RQ AGN and ``AGN feedback'' influencing the
evolution of their host galaxies.

Using first-principles calculations, we find that ThH9 has a more ionic
character between Th atoms and H cages than ThH18 and that the latter has a
more substantial hybridization of the Th 6p semicore and H 1s states than the
former. These different bonding characteristics of ThH9 and ThH18 are
associated with their stability at very different pressures. Furthermore, we
reveal that (i) the H-derived density of states at the Fermi level Ef is about
two times larger in ThH18 than in ThH9. (ii) the average squared phonon
frequency of H atoms is about 29% higher in ThH18 than in ThH9, and (iii) the
Fermi surface average squared electron-phonon matrix element is similar between
the two hydrides. Consequently, the electron-phonon coupling constant of ThH18

incentivize miners to include their transactions. To accurately estimate this
prioritization fee for a transaction, transaction issuers (or blockchain
participants, more generally) rely on two fundamental notions of transparency,
namely contention and prioritization transparency. Contention transparency
implies that participants are aware of every pending transaction that will
contend with a given transaction for inclusion. Prioritization transparency
states that the participants are aware of the transaction or prioritization
fees paid by every such contending transaction. Neither of these notions of
transparency holds well today. Private relay networks, for instance, allow
users to send transactions privately to miners. Besides, users can offer fees
to miners via either direct transfers to miners' wallets or off-chain payments
-- neither of which are public. In this work, we characterize the lack of
contention and prioritization transparency in Bitcoin and Ethereum resulting
from such practices. We show that private relay networks are widely used and
private transactions are quite prevalent. We show that the lack of transparency
facilitates miners to collude and overcharge users who may use these private
relay networks despite them offering little to no guarantees on transaction
prioritization. The lack of these transparencies in blockchains has crucial
implications for transaction issuers as well as the stability of blockchains.

to the agent-environment context of their usage and enable agents with
heterogeneous abilities to act and to reason about action. We define a formal
model for the contextual exposure of signifiers in hypermedia environments that
aims to drive affordance exploitation. We demonstrate our approach with a
prototypical Web-based MAS where two agents with different reasoning abilities
proactively discover how to interact with their environment by perceiving only
the signifiers that fit their abilities. We show that signifier exposure can be
inherently managed based on the dynamic agent-environment context towards

large-scale IoT applications for deployment within distributed and
resource-constrained Fog computing environments. As a cloud-native application
architecture, the true power of microservices comes from their loosely coupled,
independently deployable and scalable nature, enabling distributed placement
and dynamic composition across federated Fog and Cloud clusters. Thus, it is
necessary to develop novel microservice placement algorithms that utilise these
microservice characteristics to improve the performance of the applications.
However, existing Fog computing frameworks lack support for integrating such
placement policies due to their shortcomings in multiple areas, including MSA
application placement and deployment across multi-fog multi-cloud environments,
dynamic microservice composition across multiple distributed clusters,
scalability of the framework, support for deploying heterogeneous microservice
applications, etc. To this end, we design and implement MicroFog, a Fog
computing framework providing a scalable, easy-to-configure control engine that
executes placement algorithms and deploys applications across federated Fog
environments. Furthermore, MicroFog provides a sufficient abstraction over
container orchestration and dynamic microservice composition. The framework is
evaluated using multiple use cases. The results demonstrate that MicroFog is a
scalable, extensible and easy-to-configure framework that can integrate and
evaluate novel placement policies for deploying microservice-based applications
within multi-fog multi-cloud environments. We integrate multiple microservice
placement policies to demonstrate MicroFog's ability to support horizontally
scaled placement, thus reducing the application service response time up to
54%.

scale-invariant patterns, despite the different geographical and historical
environments of cities. Previous studies on universal characteristics of the
urban road networks mostly have paid attention to their network properties but
often ignored the spatial networked structures. To fill the research gap, we
explore the underlying spatial patterns of road networks. In doing so, we
inspect the travel-route efficiency in a given road network across 70 global
cities which provides information on the usage pattern and functionality of the
road structure. The efficiency is quantified by the detour patterns of the
travel routes, estimated by the detour index (DI). The DI is a long-standing
popular measure, but its spatiality has been barely considered so far. In this
study, we probe the behavior of DI with respect to spatial variables by
scanning the network radially from a city center. Through empirical analysis,
we first discover universal properties in DI throughout most cities, which are
summarized as a constant behavior of DI regardless of the radial position from
a city center and clear collapse into a single curve for DIs for various radii
with respect to the angular distance. Especially, the latter enables us to know
the scaling factor in the length scale. We also reveal that the core-periphery
spatial structure of the roads induces the universal pattern, which is
supported by an artificial road network model. Furthermore, we visualize the
spatial DI pattern on the city map to figure out the city-specific
characteristics. The most and least efficient connections of several
representative cities show the potential for practical implications in
analyzing individual cities.

paper, we investigate the MA-enhanced multiple-access channel (MAC) for the
uplink transmission from multiple users each equipped with a single MA to a

based channel model is used to characterize the multi-path channel between the
antenna array of the BS and each user's MA with a flexible position. To
evaluate the MAC performance gain provided by MAs, we formulate an optimization
problem for minimizing the total transmit power of users, subject to a
minimum-achievable-rate requirement for each user, where the positions of MAs
and the transmit powers of users, as well as the receive combining matrix at
the BS are jointly optimized. To solve this non-convex optimization problem
involving intricately coupled variables, we develop two algorithms based on
zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) combining methods,
respectively. Specifically, for each algorithm, the combining matrix of the BS
and the total transmit power of users are expressed as a function of the MAs'
position vectors, which are then optimized by using the gradient descent method
in an iterative manner. It is shown that the proposed ZF-based and MMSE-based
algorithms can converge to high-quality suboptimal solutions with low
computational complexities. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed

concept of $r$-grouped dominating sets generalizes several well-studied
variants of dominating sets with requirements for connected component sizes,
such as the ordinary dominating sets ($r=1$), paired dominating sets ($r=2$),
and connected dominating sets ($r$ is arbitrary and $k=1$). In this paper, we
investigate the computational complexity of $r$-Grouped Dominating Set, which
is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has an $r$-grouped dominating
set with at most $k$ units. For general $r$, the problem is hard to solve in
various senses because the hardness of the connected dominating set is
inherited. We thus focus on the case in which $r$ is a constant or a parameter,
but we see that the problem for every fixed $r>0$ is still hard to solve. From
the hardness, we consider the parameterized complexity concerning well-studied
graph structural parameters. We first see that it is fixed-parameter tractable
for $r$ and treewidth, because the condition of $r$-grouped domination for a
constant $r$ can be represented as monadic second-order logic (mso2). This is
good news, but the running time is not practical. We then design an
$O^*(\min\{(2\tau(r+1))^{\tau},(2\tau)^{2\tau}\})$-time algorithm for general
$r\ge 2$, where $\tau$ is the twin cover number, which is a parameter between
vertex cover number and clique-width. For paired dominating set and trio
dominating set, i.e., $r \in \{2,3\}$, we can speed up the algorithm, whose
running time becomes $O^*((r+1)^\tau)$. We further argue the relationship

the weeks after the ignition event show a blue continuum with broad, asymmetric
Balmer emission lines, and high-ionisation ([OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007)
and low-ionisation ([NII]$\lambda$6585, [SII]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731) narrow
emission lines. Following the peak in the optical light curve, the X-ray, UV,
and optical photometry all show a rapid decline. The X-ray light curve shows a
decrease in luminosity of $\sim$0.45 over 33 days and the UV shows a drop of
$\sim$0.35. eRASSt J234402.9$-$352640 also shows a brightening in the
mid-infrared, likely powered by a dust echo of the luminous ignition. We find
no evidence in Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray data for jet-like emission. The event
displays characteristics of a tidal disruption event (TDE) as well as of an
active galactic nucleus (AGN), complicating its classification. Based on the
softness of the X-ray spectrum, the presence of high-ionisation optical
emission lines, and the likely infrared echo, we find that a TDE within a
turned-off AGN best matches our observations.

the pseudo-label region and sharpen the non-pseudo-label region. For the
non-pseudo-label region, consistency constraint is also constructed to
introduce stronger supervision signals during model optimization. Our method is
so concise and efficient that it is easy to be generalized to other UDA

alternative to current compression cycles of greenhouse gases and inefficient
fuel-burning heaters. Barocaloric effects (BCE) driven by hydrostatic pressure
($p$) are especially encouraging in terms of large adiabatic temperature
changes ($|\Delta T| \sim 10$ K) and colossal isothermal entropy changes
($|\Delta S| \sim 100$ JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$). However, BCE typically require
large pressure shifts due to irreversibility issues, and sizeable $|\Delta T|$
and $|\Delta S|$ seldom are realized in a same material. Here, we demonstrate
the existence of colossal and reversible BCE in LiCB$_{11}$H$_{12}$, a
well-known solid electrolyte, near its order-disorder phase transition at
$\approx 380$ K. Specifically, for $\Delta p \approx 0.23$ $(0.10)$ GPa we
measured $|\Delta S_{\rm rev}| = 280$ $(200)$ JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$ and $|\Delta
T_{\rm rev}| = 32$ $(10)$ K, which individually rival with state-of-the-art
barocaloric shifts obtained under similar pressure conditions. Furthermore,
over a wide temperature range, pressure shifts of the order of $0.1$ GPa yield
huge reversible barocaloric strengths of $\approx 2$
JK$^{-1}$kg$^{-1}$MPa$^{-1}$. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out
to quantify the role of lattice vibrations, molecular reorientations and ion
diffusion on the disclosed colossal BCE. Interestingly, lattice vibrations were
found to contribute the most to $|\Delta S|$ while the diffusion of lithium
ions, despite adding up only slightly to the accompanying entropy change, was
crucial in enabling the molecular order-disorder phase transition. Our work
expands the knowledge on plastic crystals and should motivate the investigation
of BCE in a variety of solid electrolytes displaying ion diffusion and
concomitant molecular orientational disorder.

we present a systematic analysis of narrow Na I D absorption as a means of
probing the circumstellar environment of these events. We find a wide diversity
of evolution in ILRTs in terms of line strength, time-scale, and shape. We
present a simple toy model designed to predict this evolution as arising from
ejecta from a central supernova passing through a circumstellar environment
wherein Na II is recombining to Na I over time. We find that while our toy
model can qualitatively explain the evolution of a number of ILRTs, the

success of using the Na I D doublet as a diagnostic tool for studying
circumstellar material will rely on the availability of regular high-resolution

will be required to produce models capable of explaining the diverse range of
behaviours exhibited by ILRTs. In addition, the strength of the Na I D

(PBHs) in the early universe could significantly reduce the abundance of
certain stable massive particles (SMP) via gravitational capture, after which
the PBHs evaporate before BBN to avoid conflict with stringent bounds. For
example, this mechanism is relevant to an alternative solution of the monopole
problem proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, in which magnetic monopoles produced
in the early universe are captured by PBHs, thus freeing inflation from having
to occur during or after the corresponding phase transitions that produced the
monopoles. In this work, we reanalyze the solution by modelling the capture
process in the same way as the coexisting monopole annihilation, which exhibits
typical features of a diffusive capture. A monochromatic PBH mass function and
a radiation-dominated era before PBH evaporation are assumed. We found that for
Pati-Salam monopoles corresponding to a symmetry breaking scale between
$10^{10}\,\text{GeV}$ and $10^{15}\,\text{GeV}$, the capture rate is many
orders of magnitude below what is needed to cause a significant reduction of
the monopole density. The difference with respect to previous literature can be
attributed to both the modelling of the capture process and also the assumption
on the PBH mass function. Within our assumptions, we also found that the
magnetic charge that is large enough to make an extremal magnetic black hole
cosmologically stable cannot be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation via
monopole capture. The large magnetic charged required by cosmological stability
can nevertheless be obtained from magnetic charge fluctuation at PBH formation,
and if later the monopole abundance can be reduced significantly by some
non-inflationary mechanism, long-lived near-extremal magnetic black holes of
observational relevance might result.

for a range of initial Reynolds numbers up to 3200 with different mass
diffusion models. We show that the vortices dissipate rapidly in cases at low
Reynolds numbers, while the consistent stretching, splitting and twisting of
vortex tubes are observed in cases with evident turbulence transition at high
Reynolds numbers. Regarding the interactions between the flame and vortex, it
is demonstrated that the heat release generated by the flame has suppression
effects on the turbulence intensity and its development of the TGV. Meanwhile,
the intense turbulence provides abundant kinetic energy, accelerating the
mixing of the diffusion flame with a contribution to higher strain rate and
larger curvatures of the flame. Considering the effects of non-unity Lewis

on the nature of the magnetic moments and their interaction with Dirac

that the magnetic moments are well localised on the Mn atoms. Using triple-axis
neutron scattering we measured the magnon spectrum throughout the Brillouin
zone in the antiferromagnetically ordered phase, and we determined the dominant
exchange interactions from linear spin-wave theory. The analysis shows that the
interlayer exchange is five times larger than in several related compounds

uplink scenario where multiple legitimate transmitters try to communicate with
a base station in the presence of an adversarial jammer. The jammer possesses
full knowledge about the system and the physical parameters of the legitimate
link, while the base station only knows the UL-channels and the
angle-of-arrival (AoA) of the jamming signals. Furthermore, the legitimate
transmitters are oblivious to the fact that jamming takes place, thus the
burden of guaranteeing resilience falls on the receiver. For this case we
derive one optimal jamming strategy that aims to minimize the rate of the
strongest user and multiple receive strategies, one based on a lower bound on
the achievable signal-to-interference-to-noise-ratio (SINR), one based on a
zero-forcing (ZF) design, and one based on a minimum SINR constraint. Numerical
studies show that the proposed anti-jamming approaches ensure that the sum rate
of the system is much higher than without protection, even when the jammer has
considerably more transmit power and even if the jamming signals come from the
same direction as those of the legitimate users.

generalization in deep networks and, when optimized during training, can
improve generalization. However, standard sharpness is not invariant under
reparametrizations of neural networks, and, to fix this,
reparametrization-invariant sharpness definitions have been proposed, most
prominently adaptive sharpness (Kwon et al., 2021). But does it really capture
generalization in modern practical settings? We comprehensively explore this
question in a detailed study of various definitions of adaptive sharpness in
settings ranging from training from scratch on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 to
fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet and BERT on MNLI. We focus mostly on transformers
for which little is known in terms of sharpness despite their widespread usage.
Overall, we observe that sharpness does not correlate well with generalization
but rather with some training parameters like the learning rate that can be
positively or negatively correlated with generalization depending on the setup.
Interestingly, in multiple cases, we observe a consistent negative correlation
of sharpness with out-of-distribution error implying that sharper minima can
generalize better. Finally, we illustrate on a simple model that the right
sharpness measure is highly data-dependent, and that we do not understand well
this aspect for realistic data distributions. The code of our experiments is
available at https://github.com/tml-epfl/sharpness-vs-generalization.

assumptions on the parameters of the problem. One such assumption is sparsity,
which is commonly promoted using lasso and total variation-like regularization.
Although the solutions to many such regularized inverse problems can be
considered as points of maximum probability of well-chosen posterior
distributions, samples from these distributions are generally not sparse. In
this paper, we present a framework for implicitly defining a probability
distribution that combines the effects of sparsity imposing regularization with
Gaussian distributions. Unlike continuous distributions, these implicit
distributions can assign positive probability to sparse vectors. We study these
regularized distributions for various regularization functions including total
variation regularization and piecewise linear convex functions. We apply the
developed theory to uncertainty quantification for Bayesian linear inverse
problems and derive a Gibbs sampler for a Bayesian hierarchical model. To
illustrate the difference between our sparsity-inducing framework and
continuous distributions, we apply our framework to small-scale deblurring and

mapped to transformations of regular hexagonal and regular triangular lattices
to square lattice. The duality elements of two continuous models of fermions

view of their phase transitions. I also show that the fermion-boson map in odd
dimensions at finite temperature and imaginary chemical potential has a
generalization for arbitrary $d$ that gives an expression of the transfer
momentum of fundamental particles that behave like Bloch waves. These particles
are travelling inside a periodic potential and scattering from specific
surfaces (hexagonal and triangular kind) with a specific ordered construction
based on golden ratio formula $\phi=\frac{1}{\phi}+1$ and its generalization. I
further argue that this transfer momentum gives us a modified Bragg Law
equation which it has a large $d$ limit to the well known expression for the
transfer momentum when the scattering lattice is square. Interestingly these
surfaces make a family of some first Brillouin zones that interact with
particle beams and the maximum amount of momentum of the beam is transferred to
them for specific angles related to their construction. Their construction is
based on the golden ratio $\phi$ and the Riemann $\zeta(n)$ functions. The
zeros and extrema of the Bloch-Wigner-Ramakrishnan $D_d(z)$ functions and
Clausen $Cl_d(\theta) $ functions play an important role to the analysis since

temperature-dependent (down to 400 mK) muon-spin rotation and AC

low uniaxial stress of 0.1 GPa. This finding demonstrates the removal of the
well-known 1/8-anomaly of cuprates by uniaxial stress. On the other hand, the
spin-stripe order temperature as well as the magnetic fraction at 400 mK show
only a modest decrease under stress. Moreover, the onset temperatures of 3D
superconductivity and spin-stripe order are very similar in the large stress

full suppression of the low-temperature tetragonal structure is found at
elevated temperatures, which is a necessary condition for the development of
the 3D superconducting phase with optimal T_c. Our results evidence a
remarkable cooperation between the long-range static spin-stripe order and the

an additional ghost-penalty stabilization term is necessary. Our findings show
that both techniques suffer from cut-size dependent critical time-step sizes,

spatially separate Dirac cones. In this work, we propose a geometry-independent

to gap out the states on the undesired surfaces either by breaking the

that it is enough to have a thickness of the topological-insulator shell of

scaling with minimal and fixed shell thickness. We test the idea by comparing
the spectrum and probability distribution to analytical results for both a
proximitized Dirac mode and a Dirac mode on a sphere which exhibits a

to detect changes in point clouds rely heavily on the computation of Digital
Elevation Models (DEM) images and supervised methods. Obtaining a DEM leads to
LiDAR informational loss due to pixelisation, and supervision requires large
amounts of labelled data often unavailable in real-world scenarios. We propose
an unsupervised approach based on the computation of the transport of 3D LiDAR
points over two temporal supports. The method is based on unbalanced optimal
transport and can be generalised to any change detection problem with LiDAR

the context of enthalpy as mass of the black hole and its related thermodynamic
properties has not been tested through a vast number of literature in the
recent past. Such studies are of great physical importance as they provide us
with a large number of information regarding the thermodynamics and the
dynamics of AdS black hole systems. We invest the prior limited surveys of such
analysis to investigate the WCCC for the $D$- dimensional asymptotically
AdS-charged black holes characterized by its mass ($M$), electric charge ($Q$),
and AdS radius ($l$) under the absorption of scalar particles of charge $q$. We
examine the WCCC by analyzing the energy-momentum condition of the electrically
charged particles as absorbed by the black holes. We prove that the conjecture
is well verified irrespective of whether the initial black hole configurations
are extremal or non-extremal by changing its charge, the AdS radius, and their
variations. We show that the first law and the WCCC are valid for all spacetime
dimensions ($D$) independent of the choice of the parameters characterizing the
black holes. But to verify the second law in the extremal and non-extremal
configurations one has to be very cautious as it gets strongly affected by the
choices of the values of the black hole parameters and their variations...
  In the context of the extended phase space, taking the grand canonical
potential into account allow us to obtain the missing information about the
variation of the cosmological constant necessary to construct the extended
phase space, namely the notion of the black hole pressure, and which is absent
in the previous literature so far.

need to specialize to specific domains. A parameter-efficient adaptation method
suggests training an adapter for each domain on the task of language modeling.
This leads to good in-domain scores but can be impractical for domain- or
resource-restricted settings. A solution is to use a related-domain adapter for
the novel domain at test time. In this paper, we introduce AdapterSoup, an
approach that performs weight-space averaging of adapters trained on different
domains. Our approach is embarrassingly parallel: first, we train a set of
domain-specific adapters; then, for each novel domain, we determine which
adapters should be averaged at test time. We present extensive experiments
showing that AdapterSoup consistently improves performance to new domains
without extra training. We also explore weight averaging of adapters trained on
the same domain with different hyper-parameters, and show that it preserves the
performance of a PLM on new domains while obtaining strong in-domain results.
We explore various approaches for choosing which adapters to combine, such as
text clustering and semantic similarity. We find that using clustering leads to
the most competitive results on novel domains.

considered the main source of heating of the intergalactic medium, CRs can also
contribute to it. When the CRs propagate in the intergalactic medium, in
addition to the heating process due to CR ionization, resistive heating occurs
due to the electron return current induced by the streaming CRs. We evaluate
the heating rate around a galaxy as a function of the distance from the galaxy.
We find that the resistive heating induced by CRs dominates over the other
heating processes in the vicinity of the galaxy $r \lesssim 10^2 \,

between the achievable input/weight precision and VDP operation size, which
severely restricts their achievable VDP operation size for the quantized

for a given model the GWB SNR is lower by a factor of $\approx 2$ whereas the

significantly contribute to the overall LISA noise budget in the 1-10 mHz

limitations: 1) it gets stuck easily in spurious local minima, and 2) the
number of clusters k has to be given a priori. To solve these two issues, a
multi-prototypes convex merging based K-Means clustering algorithm (MCKM) is
presented. First, based on the structure of the spurious local minima of the
K-Means problem, a multi-prototypes sampling (MPS) is designed to select the
appropriate number of multi-prototypes for data with arbitrary shapes. A
theoretical proof is given to guarantee that the multi-prototypes selected by
MPS can achieve a constant factor approximation to the optimal cost of the
K-Means problem. Then, a merging technique, called convex merging (CM), merges
the multi-prototypes to get a better local minima without k being given a
priori. Specifically, CM can obtain the optimal merging and estimate the
correct k. By integrating these two techniques with K-Means algorithm, the
proposed MCKM is an efficient and explainable clustering algorithm for escaping
the undesirable local minima of K-Means problem without given k first.
Experimental results performed on synthetic and real-world data sets have
verified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

consistent with the 82 $\mathrm{\mu eV}$ predicted by theory. The emission from
the cavity mode shows clear threshold-like behaviour. We observe a superlinear

$\mu_n$ are related to the spectrum shape. The here advocated spectral-moment

obtained using the so-called spectrum-shape method (SSM) and its revised

axial-vector to vector couplings) and $s$ (the small vector-like relativistic
nuclear matrix element, $s$-NME). We present numerical results for three
different nuclear models with the conserved vector current hypothesis (CVC)
assumption of $g_{\rm V}=1$. We show that most of the spectral information can
be captured by the first few moments which are simple quadratic forms (conic
sections) in the $(r,\,s)$ plane: an ellipse for $n=0$ and hyperbolae for
$n\geq 1$, all being nearly degenerate as a result of cancellations among
nuclear matrix elements. The intersections of these curves, as obtained by
equating theoretical and experimental values of $\mu_n$, identify the favored
values of $(r,\,s)$ at a glance, without performing detailed fits. In
particular, we find that values around $r\sim 1$ and $s\sim 1.6$ are
consistently favored in each nuclear model, confirming the evidence for $g_{\rm

light. Here, we investigate the young (~16 Myr) bright gas-rich debris disk

detected. The disk morphology is constrained by linear-polarimetric
observations in the J band. Based on our modeling results and archival
photometry, we also model the SED to put constraints on the total dust mass and
the dust size distribution. We explore different scenarios that could explain
these new constraints. We present the first resolved image in scattered light
of the debris disk HD121617. We fit the morphology of the disk, finding a
semi-major axis of 78.3$\pm$0.2 au, an inclination of 43.1$\pm$0.2{\deg} and a
position angle of the major axis with respect to north, of 239.8$\pm$0.3{\deg},

than expected for unperturbed disks, which could also be due to a planet or gas
drag, but future observations probing the system farther from the main belt

harmonization at the semantic level by means of ontologies is essential for

only geological knowledge but also to integrate other domain knowledge at a
general level. For this reason, the domain ontologies used for describing
geological knowledge must be based on a sound ontology background to ensure the
described geological knowledge is integratable. This paper presents a domain
ontology: GeoFault, resting on the Basic Formal Ontology BFO (Arp et al., 2015)
and the GeoCore ontology (Garcia et al., 2020). It models the knowledge related
to geological faults. Faults are essential to various industries but are
complex to model. They can be described as thin deformed rock volumes or as
spatial arrangements resulting from the different displacements of geological
blocks. At a broader scale, faults are currently described as mere surfaces,
which are the components of complex fault arrays. The reference to the BFO and
GeoCore package allows assigning these various fault elements to define
ontology classes and their logical linkage within a consistent ontology
framework. The GeoFault ontology covers the core knowledge of faults 'strico
sensu,' excluding ductile shear deformations. This considered vocabulary is
essentially descriptive and related to regional to outcrop scales, excluding
microscopic, orogenic, and tectonic plate structures. The ontology is molded in
OWL 2, validated by competency questions with two use cases, and tested using
an in-house ontology-driven data entry application. The work of GeoFault
provides a solid framework for disambiguating fault knowledge and a foundation

samples-centers distances. All those lead to the algorithms converging slowly.
In this paper, a new affinity filtering technique is developed to recognize a
complete set of the non-affinity centers for each sample with low computations.
Then, a new membership scaling technique is suggested to set the membership
grades between each sample and its non-affinity centers to 0 and maintain the
fuzzy membership grades for others. By integrating those two techniques, FCM
based on new affinity filtering and membership scaling (AMFCM) is proposed to
accelerate the whole convergence process of FCM. Many experimental results

Turing's `machine model' which formalises computing with real numbers. A
fundamental distinction in Kleene's framework is between normal and non-normal
functionals where the former compute the associated Kleene quantifier
$\exists^{n}$ and the latter do not. Historically, the focus was on normal
functionals, but recently new non-normal functionals have been studied, based
on well-known theorems like the uncountability of the reals. These new
non-normal functionals are fundamentally different from historical examples
like Tait's fan functional: the latter is computable from $\exists^{2}$ while
the former are only computable in $\exists^{3}$. While there is a great divide
separating $\exists^{2}$ and $\exists^{3}$, we identify certain closely related
non-normal functionals that fall on different sides of this abyss. Our examples

treat each model invocation independently from all previous invocations, and
only a specific limited functionality is exposed within the user interface.
This approach to user interaction misses an opportunity for users to more
deeply engage with the model by having the context of their previous
interactions, as well as the context of their code, inform the model's

order to explore the utility of conversational interactions grounded in code,

prove that any node-based subgraph GNN falls into one of the six SWL

grain, where one reduces the size of the system, and a rescaling of the
interactions to compensate for the information loss. This work applies RG to
complex networks by introducing a coarse-graining method based on the Laplacian
matrix. We use a field-theoretical approach to calculate the correlation
function and coarse-grain the most correlated nodes into super-nodes, applying
our method to several artificial and real-world networks. The results are
promising, with most of the networks under analysis showing self-similar

radar applications, e.g., synthetic aperture radar, echo signal of a rapid
mobile target, etc. Many sub-optimal estimators have been developed for such
models, however, these suffer from the problem of either identifiability or
error propagation effect. In this paper, we have developed theoretical
properties of the least squares estimators (LSEs) of the parameters of
multi-component chirp model with equal chirp rates, where the model is
contaminated with linear stationary errors. We also propose two computationally
efficient estimators as alternative to LSEs, namely sequential combined
estimators and sequential plugin estimators. Strong consistency and asymptotic
normality of these estimators have been derived. Interestingly, it is observed
that sequential combined estimator of the chirp rate parameter is
asymptotically efficient. Extensive numerical simulations have been performed,
which validate satisfactory computational and theoretical performance of all
three estimators. {We have also analysed a simulated radar data with the help
of our proposed estimators of multi-component chirp model with equal chirp
rates, which performs efficiently in recovery of inverse synthetic aperture

compute capabilities. This leads to security and privacy concerns about user
data. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising solution to address the data
privacy problem as it allows arbitrarily complex computations on encrypted data
without ever needing to decrypt it. While there has been a lot of work on
accelerating HE computations in the cloud, little attention has been paid to
the message-to-ciphertext and ciphertext-to-message conversion operations on
the edge. In this work, we profile the edge-side conversion operations, and our
analysis shows that during conversion error sampling, encryption, and
decryption operations are the bottlenecks. To overcome these bottlenecks, we
present RISE, an area and energy-efficient RISC-V SoC. RISE leverages an
efficient and lightweight pseudo-random number generator core and combines it
with fast sampling techniques to accelerate the error sampling operations. To
accelerate the encryption and decryption operations, RISE uses scalable,
data-level parallelism to implement the number theoretic transform operation,
the main bottleneck within the encryption and decryption operations. In
addition, RISE saves area by implementing a unified en/decryption datapath, and
efficiently exploits techniques like memory reuse and data reordering to
utilize a minimal amount of on-chip memory. We evaluate RISE using a complete
RTL design containing a RISC-V processor interfaced with our accelerator. Our
analysis reveals that for message-to-ciphertext conversion and
ciphertext-to-message conversion, using RISE leads up to 6191.19X and 2481.44X
more energy-efficient solution, respectively, than when using just the RISC-V

considered a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. In this paper, we
develop a novel data-driven method -- anti-circulant dynamic mode decomposition
with sparsity-promoting (circDMDsp) -- to study the dynamics of highway traffic
speed data. Particularly, circDMDsp addresses several issues that hinder the
application of existing DMD models: limited spatial dimension, presence of both
recurrent and non-recurrent patterns, high level of noise, and known mode
stability. The proposed circDMDsp framework allows us to numerically extract
spatial-temporal coherent structures with physical meanings/interpretations:
the dynamic modes reflect coherent spatial bases, and the corresponding
temporal patterns capture the temporal oscillation/evolution of these dynamic
modes. Our result based on Seattle highway loop detector data showcases that
traffic speed data is governed by a set of periodic components, e.g., mean
pattern, daily pattern, and weekly pattern, and each of them has a unique
spatial structure. The spatiotemporal patterns can also be used to
recover/denoise observed data and predict future values at any timestamp by
extrapolating the temporal Vandermonde matrix. Our experiments also demonstrate
that the proposed circDMDsp framework is more accurate and robust in data
reconstruction and prediction than other DMD-based models.

systems in intelligent vehicles. To accurately detect potential vehicle
collisions, reachability-based formal approaches have been developed to ensure
driving safety, but suffer from over-conservatism, potentially leading to
false-positive risk events in complicated real-world applications. In this
work, we combine two reachability analysis techniques, i.e., backward reachable
set (BRS) and stochastic forward reachable set (FRS), and propose an integrated
probabilistic collision detection framework in highway driving. Within the
framework, we can firstly use a BRS to formally check whether a two-vehicle
interaction is safe; otherwise, a prediction-based stochastic FRS is employed
to estimate a collision probability at each future time step. In doing so, the
framework can not only identify non-risky events with guaranteed safety, but
also provide accurate collision risk estimation in safety-critical events. To
construct the stochastic FRS, we develop a neural network-based acceleration
model for surrounding vehicles, and further incorporate confidence-aware
dynamic belief to improve the prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments are
conducted to validate the performance of the acceleration prediction model
based on naturalistic highway driving data, and the efficiency and
effectiveness of the framework with the infused confidence belief are tested
both in naturalistic and simulated highway scenarios. The proposed risk
assessment framework is promising in real-world applications.

recommendation in a low-resource target market using data from a richer,
auxiliary source market. Prior work in CMR utilised meta-learning to improve
recommendation performance in target markets; meta-learning however can be
complex and resource intensive. In this paper, we propose market-aware (MA)
models, which directly model a market via market embeddings instead of
meta-learning across markets. These embeddings transform item representations
into market-specific representations. Our experiments highlight the
effectiveness and efficiency of MA models both in a pairwise setting with a
single target-source market, as well as a global model trained on all markets
in unison. In the former pairwise setting, MA models on average outperform
market-unaware models in 85% of cases on nDCG@10, while being time-efficient -
compared to meta-learning models, MA models require only 15% of the training
time. In the global setting, MA models outperform market-unaware models
consistently for some markets, while outperforming meta-learning-based methods
for all but one market. We conclude that MA models are an efficient and
effective alternative to meta-learning, especially in the global setting.

inspection systems to search for concealed illicit materials. By using two
photon beams with different energy spectra, dual energy inspection systems are
sensitive to both the area density and the atomic number of cargo contents.
Most literature on the subject assumes a simple exponential attenuation model
for photon intensity in which only free streaming photons are detected.
However, this approximation neglects second order effects such as scattering,
leading to a biased model and thus incorrect material predictions. This work
studies the accuracy of the free streaming model by comparing it to simulation
outputs, finding that the model shows poor atomic number reconstruction
accuracy at high-$Z$ and suffers significantly if the source energy spectra and
detector response function are not known exactly. To address these challenges,
this work introduces a semiempirical transparency model which modifies the free
streaming model by rescaling different components of the mass attenuation
coefficient, allowing the model to capture secondary effects ignored by the
free streaming model. The semiempirical model displays improvement agreement
with simulated results at high-$Z$ and shows excellent extrapolation to
materials and thicknesses which were not included during the calibration step.
Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the semiempirical model yields
accurate atomic number predictions even when the source spectra and detector
response are not known exactly. Using the semiempirical model, manufacturers
can perform a simple calibration to enable more precise $Z$ reconstruction
capabilities, which has the potential to significantly improve the performance
of existing radiographic systems.

``pocket'') on a protein, predicting the binding mode of the protein-ligand

have been developed for molecular docking, while most existing deep learning
models perform docking on the whole protein, rather than on a given pocket as
the traditional molecular docking approaches, which does not match common
needs. What's more, they claim to perform better than traditional molecular
docking, but the approach of comparison is not fair, since traditional methods
are not designed for docking on the whole protein without a given pocket. In
this paper, we design a series of experiments to examine the actual performance
of these deep learning models and traditional methods. For a fair comparison,
we decompose the docking on the whole protein into two steps, pocket searching
and docking on a given pocket, and build pipelines to evaluate traditional
methods and deep learning methods respectively. We find that deep learning
models are actually good at pocket searching, but traditional methods are
better than deep learning models at docking on given pockets. Overall, our work
explicitly reveals some potential problems in current deep learning models for

this, we propose a question-guided generation framework that models events in

the generation process, the framework uses the previously generated events as

what else a participant did, what else happened to a participant, or what else
happened. The participants and the questions themselves can be sampled or be
provided as input from a user, allowing for controllable exploration. Our
empirical evaluation shows that this question-guided generation provides better

the system while being able to incorporate other system observables, such as
membrane voltage measurements, in a principled way. This leads to a
one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the information efficiency of the
gradient estimate, which would directly translate to corresponding energy

the potential to enable scalable gradient estimation in large-scale

multi-scale observational data of the (sub)millimeter dust continuum emission

able to consistently reproduce the observed multi-scale dust continuum images
of the cores with a simple prescribed density profile, which bears an inner
region of flat density and a r^-2 profile toward the outer region. By utilizing
the peak density and the size of the inner flat region as a proxy for the
dynamical stage of the cores, we find that the three modeled cores are most

network for detecting various types of natural vocal productions in a noisy

different data sets, one from a group of Guinea baboons recorded from a primate
research center and one from human babies recorded at home. The pipeline trains
a model on 72 and 77 minutes of labeled audio recordings, with an accuracy of

continuous recordings and it creates two new databases of 38.8 and 35.2 hours,

can be applied to any massive audio recording.

Physionet's MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database

test classification models on. These two datasets are very different. The
MIT-BIH database contains long samples taken with a medical grade device, which
is not useful for simulating a consumer device, but is useful for Atrial
Fibrillation pattern detection. The 2017 Challenge database includes short

challenges of Atrial Fibrillation classification in a real-time device. We
developed multiple SVM models with three sets of extracted features as
predictor variables which gave us moderately high accuracies with low

many Photoplethysmograph-based consumer heart-rate monitors, this method can be
used to develop a reliable real time model for Atrial Fibrillation detection in

information-theoretical secure (ITS) communication over a large-scale network.
Most researches on relay-based QKD network assume that all relays are
completely trustworthy, but the assumption is unrealistic in a complex network.
The current study only analyzes the case of passive attacks by untrusted relays
(e.g. eavesdropping). However, active attacks by untrusted relays (e.g.
spoofing or interfering with the cooperation between honest nodes) are more
serious threats and should not be ignored. Taking both passive and active
attacks into account, we propose the ITSBFT-QKD networks to defend against
untrusted nodes and achieve end-to-end key distribution. In end-to-end key
distribution, multiple participating nodes are required to establish trust
relationships and cooperate with each other. To prevent attackers from breaking
trust relationship and gaining an unreasonable advantage, we incorporate a
byzantine consensus scheme to establish and transmit trust relationships in a
global QKD network perspective. Moreover, since the security of traditional
consensus schemes is lower than the security requirement of QKD networks, we
devise a byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) signature scheme to ensure the
information-theoretic security of consensus. It provides a new way to construct
signature schemes with point-to-point QKD keys in the presence of untrusted
relays or nodes. The security of our scheme is analyzed thoroughly from
multiple aspects. Our scheme can accommodate up to $ MIN\left( C-1,\lfloor
\frac{N-1}{3} \rfloor \right) $ untrusted nodes, where $C$ is the node
connectivity of the network and $N$ is the number of nodes in the network. Our
scheme provides the highest level of security in currently relay-based QKD
networks and will significantly promote the application of QKD networks.

controversial topic. The predictions of different models disagree, particularly
concerning the correlation between the fragments' angular momenta. In this
letter, a time-dependent collective Hamiltonian model is constructed in the
framework of the microscopic frozen Hartree-Fock approximation. The model
presents a formalism to treat the generation of the angular momenta in the
fission fragments due to the quantum uncertainty principle as well as the
dynamics of the collective wave function during scission and the Coulomb
reorientation phase. The model is able to describe a large part of the angular
momentum found in experimental data. Some of the conclusions of the collective
vibration model are supported by the quantum model but not all of the
predictions are. Surprisingly, it is found that the angular momenta of the
fragments are slightly correlated in a wriggling mode. In agreement with
experimental data, the orientation of the angular momentum of each fragment is
found to be mainly in the plane perpendicular to the fission axis. The
magnitudes of the angular momenta are almost uncorrelated in agreement with the
recent experimental data of Wilson et al., Nature (London) 590, 566 (2021).
Additionally, the model shows that the octupole deformation significantly
increases the angular momentum in the heavy fragment which was never expected
in previous models.

solve the KT problem. However, there are two important factors in real-world
educational data that are not well represented. First, most existing works
augment input representations with the co-occurrence matrix of questions and
knowledge components\footnote{\label{ft:kc}A KC is a generalization of everyday
terms like concept, principle, fact, or skill.} (KCs) but fail to explicitly
integrate such intrinsic relations into the final response prediction task.
Second, the individualized historical performance of students has not been well
captured. In this paper, we proposed \emph{AT-DKT} to improve the prediction
performance of the original deep knowledge tracing model with two auxiliary
learning tasks, i.e., \emph{question tagging (QT) prediction task} and
\emph{individualized prior knowledge (IK) prediction task}. Specifically, the
QT task helps learn better question representations by predicting whether
questions contain specific KCs. The IK task captures students' global
historical performance by progressively predicting student-level prior
knowledge that is hidden in students' historical learning interactions. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world educational datasets and
compare the proposed approach to both deep sequential KT models and
non-sequential models. Experimental results show that \emph{AT-DKT} outperforms
all sequential models with more than 0.9\% improvements of AUC for all
datasets, and is almost the second best compared to non-sequential models.
Furthermore, we conduct both ablation studies and quantitative analysis to show

ignore the inter-class relationships with the majority ones, which is prone to
overfitting, especially when the imbalance ratio is large. To address this

VAE~(MGVAE), which generates new minority samples under the guidance of a

inherit the diversity and richness of the majority ones, thus mitigating
overfitting in downstream tasks. Furthermore, to prevent model collapse under

fine-tune based on minority samples with Elastic Weight Consolidation(EWC)

machine-dependent characteristics such as execution unit utilization, number of
register spills, latency, throughput etc. to generate better code. Often a
hand-written static/analytical hardware cost model is built into the compiler.
However, the need for more sophisticated and varied predictions has become more
pronounced with the development of deep learning compilers which need to
optimize dataflow graphs. Such compilers usually employ a much higher level
MLIR form as an IR representation before lowering to traditional LLVM-IR. A
static/analytical cost model in such a scenario is cumbersome and error prone
as the opcodes represent very high level algebraic/arithmetic operations.
Hence, we develop a machine learning-based cost model for high-level MLIR which
can predict different target variables of interest such as CPU/GPU/xPU
utilization, instructions executed, register usage etc. By considering the
incoming MLIR as a text input a la NLP models we can apply well-known
techniques from modern NLP research to help predict hardware characteristics
more accurately. We expect such precise ML-driven hardware cost models to guide

eye position signal or the RMS of the sample-to-sample differences (StoS)
signal during fixation. As both measures emerge from statistical theory applied
to time-series, there are certain statistical assumptions that accompany their
use. It is intuitively obvious that the SD is most useful when applied to
unimodal distributions. Both measures assume stationarity, which means that the
statistical properties of the signals are stable over time. Both metrics assume
the samples of the signals are independent. The presence of autocorrelation
indicates that the samples in the time series are not independent. We tested
these assumptions with multiple fixations from two studies, a publicly
available dataset that included both human and artificial eyes (""HA Dataset"",
N=224 fixations), and data from our laboratory of 4 subjects (""TXstate"", N=37
fixations). Many position signal distributions were multimodal (HA: median=32%,
TXstate: median=100%). No fixation position signals were stationary. All
position signals were statistically significantly autocorrelated (p < 0:01).
Thus, the statistical assumptions of the SD were not met for any fixation. All
StoS signals were unimodal. Some StoS signals were stationary (HA: 34%,
TXstate: 24%). Almost all StoS signals were statistically significantly
autocorrelated (p < 0:01). For TXstate, 3 of 37 fixations met all assumptions.
Thus, the statistical assumptions of the RMS were generally not met. The
general failure of these assumptions calls into question the appropriateness of
the SD or the RMS-StoS as metrics of precision for eye-trackers.

  by scalable vector graphics",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multifocal laser direct writing (LDW) based on phase-only spatial light
modulator (SLM) can realize flexible and parallel nanofabrication with high
throughput potential. In this investigation, a novel approach of combining
two-photon absorption, SLM and vector path guided by scalable vector graphics
(SVG) has been developed and tested preliminarily, for fast, flexible and
parallel nanofabrication. Three laser focuses are independently controlled with
different paths, which are according to SVG, to optimize fabrication and
promote time efficiency. The minimum structure width can be as low as 74 nm.
Accompanied with a translation stage, a carp structure of 18.16 $\mu$m by 24.35
$\mu$m has been fabricated. This method shows the possibility of developing LDW
techniques towards full-electrical system, and provides a potential way to
efficiently engrave complex structures on nanoscales.

analysis of proofs as objects in a global manner. In this first approach the
formalism is restricted to first-order problems characterized by condensed
detachment. It is applied in an exemplary manner to a coherent and
comprehensive formal reconstruction and analysis of historical proofs of a
widely-studied problem due to {\L}ukasiewicz. The underlying approach opens the
door towards new systematic ways of generating lemmas in the course of proof
search to the effects of reducing the search effort and finding shorter proofs.
Among the numerous reported experiments along this line, a proof of
{\L}ukasiewicz's problem was automatically discovered that is much shorter than
any proof found before by man or machine.

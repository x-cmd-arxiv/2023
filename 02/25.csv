the design of such systems remains daunting, requiring both expertise and time.
In an attempt to close the gap between software development and hardware
design, powerful features such as functional and object-oriented programming
have been used to define new languages, known as Hardware Construction
Languages. In this article, we investigate the usage of such languages - more
precisely, of Chisel - in the context of Design Space Exploration, and propose
a novel design methodology to build custom and adaptable design flows. We apply
a functional approach to define flexible strategies for design space
exploration, based on combinations of basic exploration steps, and provide a
proof-of-concept framework along with a library of basic strategies. We
demonstrate our methodology through several use cases, illustrating how various
metrics of interest can be considered to build exploration processes - in
particular, we provide a quality of service-driven exploration example.
  The methodology presented in this work makes use of designers' expertise to
reduce the time required for hardware design, in particular for Design Space

Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions. The superbubble is located in
the interarm region ~3 kpc from the galactic center in the south-east
direction. The shell surrounding the superbubble is detected in HI, CO, and
Halpha with an expansion velocity of 12 km/s, and contains as much as 2x10^7
Msun of mass in gas that is mostly in molecular form. We find a clear excess of
blue, bright stars inside the bubble as compared to the surrounding disk on the
HST/ACS images. These excess blue, bright stars are part of a stellar
population of 10^5 Msun mass that is formed over the last 50 Myr in different
star formation episodes, as determined from an analysis of color-magnitude
diagrams using a Bayesian technique. The mechanical power injected by the
massive stars of these populations is sufficient to provide the energy
necessary for the expansion of the shell gas. Slow and steady, rather than
violent, injection of energy is probably the reason for the maintenance of the
shell structure over the kiloparsec scale. The expanding shell is currently the
site for triggered star formation as inferred from the JWST 21 micron (F2100W
filter) and the Halpha images.

can deliver real-time maps of absorption and reduced scattering coefficients.
However, there are a wide range of imaging geometries that practical SFDI
systems must cope with including imaging flat samples ex vivo, imaging inside
tubular lumen in vivo such as in an endoscopy, and measuring tumours or polyps
of varying shapes, sizes and optical properties. There is a need for a design
and simulation tool to accelerate design and fabrication of new SFDI systems.
We present such a system implemented using open-source 3D design and
ray-tracing software Blender that is capable of simulating media with realistic
optical properties (mimicking healthy and cancerous tissue), a wide variety of
shapes and size, and in both planar and tubular imaging geometries. We first
demonstrate quantitative agreement between Monte-Carlo simulated scattering and
absorption coefficients and those measured from our Blender system. Next, we
show the ability of the system to simulate absorption, scattering and shape for
flat samples with small simulated tumours and show that the improved contrast
associated with SFDI is reproduced. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of
the system as a design tool we show that it can be used to generate a custom
look-up-table for mapping from modulation amplitude values to absorption and
scattering values in a tubular geometry, simulating a lumen. As a demonstrative
example we show that longitudinal sectioning of the tube, with separate look-up
tables for each section, significantly improves accuracy of SFDI, representing
an important design insight for future systems. We therefore anticipate our
simulation system will significantly aid in the design and development of novel
SFDI systems, especially as such systems are miniaturised for deployment in
endoscopic and laparoscopic systems.

transferable representations by learning invariances to different data
augmentations. Invariances established during pre-training can be interpreted
as strong inductive biases. However these may or may not be helpful, depending
on if they match the invariance requirements of downstream tasks or not. This
has led to several attempts to learn task-specific invariances during
pre-training, however, these methods are highly compute intensive and tedious
to train. We introduce the notion of amortised invariance learning for
contrastive self supervision. In the pre-training stage, we parameterize the
feature extractor by differentiable invariance hyper-parameters that control
the invariances encoded by the representation. Then, for any downstream task,
both linear readout and task-specific invariance requirements can be
efficiently and effectively learned by gradient-descent. We evaluate the notion
of amortised invariances for contrastive learning over two different
modalities: vision and audio, on two widely-used contrastive learning methods
in vision: SimCLR and MoCo-v2 with popular architectures like ResNets and
Vision Transformers, and SimCLR with ResNet-18 for audio. We show that our
amortised features provide a reliable way to learn diverse downstream tasks
with different invariance requirements, while using a single feature and
avoiding task-specific pre-training. This provides an exciting perspective that
opens up new horizons in the field of general purpose representation learning.

assignments for each segment. In this paper, we propose a novel Supervised
HierArchical gRaph Clustering algorithm (SHARC) for speaker diarization where
we introduce a hierarchical structure using Graph Neural Network (GNN) to
perform supervised clustering. The supervision allows the model to update the
representations and directly improve the clustering performance, thus enabling
a single-step approach for diarization. In the proposed work, the input segment
embeddings are treated as nodes of a graph with the edge weights corresponding
to the similarity scores between the nodes. We also propose an approach to
jointly update the embedding extractor and the GNN model to perform end-to-end
speaker diarization (E2E-SHARC). During inference, the hierarchical clustering
is performed using node densities and edge existence probabilities to merge the
segments until convergence. In the diarization experiments, we illustrate that
the proposed E2E-SHARC approach achieves 53% and 44% relative improvements over
the baseline systems on benchmark datasets like AMI and Voxconverse,

matter of fact, the general correlation among observations imposes a challenge
on interval estimation. Most existing methods may ignore this correlation and
lead to invalid confidence intervals. In this paper, we propose a mini-batch
SGD estimator for statistical inference when the data is $\phi$-mixing. The
confidence intervals are constructed using an associated mini-batch bootstrap
SGD procedure. Using ``independent block'' trick from \cite{yu1994rates}, we
show that the proposed estimator is asymptotically normal, and its limiting

proposed method is memory-efficient and easy to implement in practice.
Simulation studies on synthetic data and an application to a real-world dataset

using the M1 closure in the open source code SWIFT, is presented, and validated
using standard tests for radiative transfer. GEAR-RT is modeled after RAMSES-RT
(Rosdahl et al. 2013) with some key differences. Firstly, while RAMSES-RT uses
Finite Volume methods and an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy, GEAR-RT
employs particles as discretization elements and solves the equations using a
Finite Volume Particle Method (FVPM). Secondly, GEAR-RT makes use of the
task-based parallelization strategy of SWIFT, which allows for optimized load
balancing, increased cache efficiency, asynchronous communications, and a
domain decomposition based on work rather than on data. GEAR-RT is able to
perform sub-cycles of radiative transfer steps w.r.t. a single hydrodynamics
step. Radiation requires much smaller time step sizes than hydrodynamics, and
sub-cycling permits calculations which are not strictly necessary to be
skipped. Indeed, in a test case with gravity, hydrodynamics, and radiative
transfer, the sub-cycling is able to reduce the runtime of a simulation by over
90%. Allowing only a part of the involved physics to be sub-cycled is a
contrived matter when task-based parallelism is involved, and is an entirely
novel feature in SWIFT.
  Since GEAR-RT uses a FVPM, a detailed introduction into Finite Volume methods
and Finite Volume Particle Methods is presented. In astrophysical literature,
two FVPM methods are written about: Hopkins (2015) have implemented one in
their GIZMO code, while the one mentioned in Ivanova et al. (2013) isn't used
to date. In this work, I test an implementation of the Ivanova et al. (2013)
version, and conclude that in its current form, it is not suitable for use with
particles which are co-moving with the fluid, which in turn is an essential
feature for cosmological simulations.

across different studies each study will result in either an approval or a lack
of approval of the drug compound studied. The False Approval Rate (FAR) is the
proportion of drug compounds that lack efficacy incorrectly approved by
regulators. (In the U.S., compounds that have efficacy and are approved are not
involved in the FAR consideration, according to our reading of the relevant
U.S. Congressional statute).
  While Tukey's (1953) Error Rate Familwise (ERFw) is meant to be applied
within a clinical study, Tukey's (1953) Error Rate per Family (ERpF), defined
alongside ERFw,is meant to be applied across studies. We show that controlling
Error Rate Familwise (ERFw) within a clinical study at 5% in turn controls
Error Rate per Family (ERpF) across studies at 5-per-100, regardless of whether
the studies are correlated or not. Further, we show that ongoing regulatory
practice, the additive multiplicity adjustment method of controlling ERpF, is
controlling False Approval Rate FAR exactly (not conservatively) at 5-per-100
(even for Platform trials).
  In contrast, if a regulatory agency chooses to control the False Discovery
Rate (FDR) across studies at 5% instead, then this change in policy from ERpF
control to FDR control will result in incorrectly approving drug compounds that
lack efficacy at a rate higher than 5-per-100, because in essence it gives the
industry additional rewards for successfully developing compounds that have
efficacy and are approved. Seems to us the discussion of such a change in
policy would be at a level higher than merely statistical, needing
harmonizsation/harmonization. (In the U.S., policy is set by the Congress.)

the phase space (position-momentum space). Given the non-commutative nature of
the phase space coordinates, we show that the momentum space dimensions should
be counted as negative dimensions for SPT classification purposes. Therefore,
the classification of phase-space Chern insulators (or, more generally
fermionic SPT phases) always reduces to a $(0+1)$-dimensional problem, which
can then be answered by the cobordism approach. In addition to the
codimension-1 Fermi surface case, we also discuss the codimension-$p$ Fermi

to the difference between a client's updated parameter and all clients' average

we extend our pricing scheme to fit incomplete information of clients' privacy

  impacting drop on atomically smooth mica",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Before a droplet can contact a surface during impact, it must first displace
the air beneath it. Over a wide range of impact velocities, the air is
compressed into a thin film, slowing the progress of the liquid toward the
surface. Below a critical impact velocity, the air film remains intact; the
droplet rebounds off of the air film without making contact. Above this
critical impact velocity, the droplet always makes contact. The initiation of
contact formation occurs via a topological transition, whereby the initially
connected gas domain is ruptured, and a liquid capillary bridge forms, binding
the droplet to the surface. Here we probe this transition in detail around the
critical impact velocity using calibrated total internal reflection (TIR)
microscopy to monitor the air film profile at high speed during the impact
process. Two air film rupture modalities are observed: nucleated contacts,
which are isolated and don't correspond to the global minimum air film
thickness, and spontaneous contacts, that occur always on a ring centered upon
the impact axis where the air film reaches its global minimum. Our measurements
show that for impact velocities exceeding the critical velocity for contact
initiation, the air film ruptures at a nearly identical height h min ~ 20 nm,
for two fluids - silicone oil and a water glycerol mixture. The height and time
duration of the air film prior to contact, analyzed for over 180 droplet impact
experiments, are consistent with a linear instability driven by van der Waals
forces. Impact events of water solution droplets show different statistics for
contact nucleation than the silicon oil; nevertheless, a critical impact
velocity above which contact always occurs is identified for both liquids.

ensembles are a promising platform to explore complex many-body dynamics and
the emergence of quantum hydrodynamics. However, many interesting properties
can be revealed only upon changes in the density of defects, which instead is
usually fixed in material systems. Increasing the interaction strength by
creating denser defect ensembles also brings more decoherence. Ideally one
would like to control the spin concentration at will, while keeping fixed
decoherence effects. Here we show that by exploiting charge transport, we can
take some first steps in this direction, while at the same time characterizing
charge transport and its capture by defects. By exploiting the cycling process
of ionization and recombination of NV centers in diamonds, we pump electrons
from the valence band to the conduction band. These charges are then
transported to modulate the spin concentration by changing the charge state of
material defects. By developing a wide-field imaging setup integrated with a
fast single photon detector array, we achieve a direct and efficient
characterization of the charge redistribution process by measuring the complete
spectrum of the spin bath with micrometer-scale spatial resolution. We
demonstrate the concentration increase of the dominant spin defects by a factor
of 2 while keeping the $T_2$ of the NV center, which also provides a potential
experimental demonstration of the suppression of spin flip-flops via hyperfine

it combines a protocol that allows dynamic participation among validators,
called LMD-GHOST, and a finality gadget, called Casper. This design has been
motivated and formalized by Neu, Tas, and Tse (S&P 2021) through the
introduction of the ebb-and-flow class of protocols, which are protocols with
two confirmation rules that output two ledgers, one that provides liveness
under dynamic participation (and synchrony), LMD-GHOST, and one that provides
safety even under network partitions, Casper.
  Currently, Gasper takes between 64 and 95 slots to finalize blocks. Because
of that, a significant portion of the chain is susceptible to reorgs. The
possibility to capture MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) through such reorgs can
then disincentivize honestly following the protocol, breaking the desired
correspondence of honest and rational behavior. Moreover, the relatively long
time to finality forces users to choose between economic security and faster
transaction confirmation. This motivates the study of the so-called single slot
finality protocols: consensus protocols that finalize a block in each slot and,
more importantly, that finalize the block proposed at a given slot within such
slot.
  In this work we propose a simple, non-blackbox protocol that combines a
synchronous dynamically available protocol with a finality gadget, resulting in
a secure ebb-and-flow protocol that can finalize one block per slot, paving the
way to single slot finality within Ethereum. Importantly, the protocol we
present can finalize the block proposed in a slot, within such slot.

the geometric phase that is associated with a collection of partially

photon sources that interfere in a cyclic interferometer. Crucially, the
interferometer is fixed, i.e., it has no variable internal phase shifts or
subsequent measurement settings. Instead, the measurement choices of the
different parties correspond to the internal states of the input photons which
influence the observed correlations via the geometric phase, constituting a
completely new approach to the generation of nonlocality. Further, we show that
in any fixed interferometer with independent single-photon inputs, nontrivial
geometric factors between the internal photon states are necessary to create
nonlocal correlations. We observe a trade-off between the geometric phases and
the visibility of the many-photon interference, impeding the generation of

instances, we are not aware of the time of event, or if one even occurred.
Imbalances in censoring and time horizons cause generative models to experience
three new failure modes specific to survival analysis: (1) generating too few
at-risk members; (2) generating too many at-risk members; and (3) censoring too
early. We formalize these failure modes and provide three new generative
metrics to quantify them. Following this, we propose SurvivalGAN, a generative
model that handles survival data firstly by addressing the imbalance in the
censoring and event horizons, and secondly by using a dedicated mechanism for
approximating time-to-event/censoring. We evaluate this method via extensive
experiments on medical datasets. SurvivalGAN outperforms multiple baselines at
generating survival data, and in particular addresses the failure modes as
measured by the new metrics, in addition to improving downstream performance of
survival models trained on the synthetic data.

bubble chamber to measure the cross section of the time-inverse
photo-dissociation reaction. The method benefits from a luminosity increase of
several orders of magnitude due to the use of a thicker liquid target -- when
compared to thin films or gas targets -- and from the reciprocity theorem. We
discuss the results of an experiment at the Thomas Jefferson National
Accelerator Facility, where the cross section of the photodisintegration
process $^{19}$F($\gamma$, $\alpha$)$^{15}$N was measured by bombarding a
superheated fluid of C$_3$F$_8$ with bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-rays produced by
impinging a 4 - 5.5 MeV electron beam on a Cu radiator. From the
photodissociation yield the cross section was extracted by performing a
convolution with a Monte Carlo-generated $\gamma$-ray beam spectrum. The
measurement produced a cross section that was then time inverted using the
reciprocity theorem. The cross section for the
$^{15}$N($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{19}$F reaction was determined down to a value in
the range of hundreds of picobarns. With further improvements of the
experimental setup the technique could potentially push cross section
measurements down to the single picobarn range.

on a parameter $t$ in a compact set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Application areas
that give rise to such problems include computational statistics and dynamical
systems. Randomized algorithms are an increasingly popular approach for
performing low-rank approximation and they usually proceed by multiplying the
matrix with random dimension reduction matrices (DRMs). Applying such
algorithms directly to $A(t)$ would involve different, independent DRMs for
every $t$, which is not only expensive but also leads to inherently non-smooth
approximations. In this work, we propose to use constant DRMs, that is, $A(t)$
is multiplied with the same DRM for every $t$. The resulting
parameter-dependent extensions of two popular randomized algorithms, the
randomized singular value decomposition and the generalized Nystr\""{o}m method,
are computationally attractive, especially when $A(t)$ admits an affine linear
decomposition with respect to $t$. We perform a probabilistic analysis for both
algorithms, deriving bounds on the expected value as well as failure
probabilities for the $L^2$ approximation error when using Gaussian random
DRMs. Both, the theoretical results and numerical experiments, show that the
use of constant DRMs does not impair their effectiveness; our methods reliably

$\varphi$, which is the number of non-zero elements per row and column in the
generator matrix. Thus, a member of the ensemble is characterized by the
Laplacian of a directed regular graph with $D$ vertices (number of system

effects of sparsity on the spectrum of the generator. Sparsity is shown to
close the large spectral gap that is characteristic of non-sparse random
generators. We show that the first moment of the eigenvalue distribution scales
as $\sim \varphi$, while its variance is $\sim \sqrt{\varphi}$. By using
extreme value theory, we demonstrate how the shape of the spectral edges is
determined by the tails of the corresponding weight distributions, and clarify
the behavior of the spectral gap as a function of $D$. Finally, we analyze

density functional tight-binding method (DFTB) is an approximate DFT that
bridges the gap between first principles methods and empirical electronic
structure schemes. While purely long-range corrected RSH are already accessible
within DFTB for molecular systems, this work generalizes the theoretical
foundation to also include screened range-separated hybrids, with conventional
pure hybrid functionals as a special case. The presented formulation and
implementation is also valid for periodic boundary conditions (PBC) beyond the

expressions for the DFTB method, using standard integral approximations and
their efficient implementation in the DFTB+ software package. Convergence
behavior is investigated and demonstrated for the polyacene series as well as

treatment effects from observational panel data. It rests on a crucial
assumption that we can write the treated unit as a linear combination of the
untreated units. This linearity assumption, however, can be unlikely to hold in
practice and, when violated, the resulting SC estimates are incorrect. In this
paper we examine two questions: (1) How large can the misspecification error
be? (2) How can we limit it? First, we provide theoretical bounds to quantify
the misspecification error. The bounds are comforting: small misspecifications
induce small errors. With these bounds in hand, we then develop new SC
estimators that are specially designed to minimize misspecification error. The
estimators are based on additional data about each unit, which is used to
produce the SC weights. (For example, if the units are countries then the
additional data might be demographic information about each.) We study our
estimators on synthetic data; we find they produce more accurate causal
estimates than standard synthetic controls. We then re-analyze the California
tobacco-program data of the original SC paper, now including additional data
from the US census about per-state demographics. Our estimators show that the
observations in the pre-treatment period lie within the bounds of
misspecification error, and that the observations post-treatment lie outside of
those bounds. This is evidence that our SC methods have uncovered a true
effect.

short-period orbits -- came as a surprise to solar-system-centric models of
planet formation, prompting the development of new theories for planetary
system evolution. The near-absence of observed nearby planetary companions to
hot Jupiters has been widely quoted as evidence in support of high-eccentricity
tidal migration: a framework in which hot Jupiters form further out in their
natal protoplanetary disks before being thrown inward with extremely high
eccentricities, stripping systems of any close-in planetary companions. In this
work, we present new results from a search for transit timing variations across
the full four-year Kepler dataset, demonstrating that at least $12\pm6\%$ of
hot Jupiters have a nearby planetary companion. This subset of hot Jupiters is
expected to have a quiescent dynamical history such that the systems could
retain their nearby companions. We also demonstrate a ubiquity of nearby
planetary companions to warm Jupiters ($\geq70\pm{16}\%$), indicating that warm
Jupiters typically form quiescently. We conclude by combining our results with
existing observational constraints to propose an ``eccentric migration''
framework for the formation of short-period giant planets through post-disk
dynamical sculpting in compact multi-planet systems. Our framework suggests
that hot Jupiters constitute the natural end stage for giant planets spanning a
wide range of eccentricities, with orbits that reach small enough periapses --
either from their final orbital configurations in the disk phase, or from
eccentricity excitation in the post-disk phase -- to trigger efficient tidal
circularization.

  https://github.com/thanhnguyentang/neural-offline-rl; v2: change title",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel algorithm for offline reinforcement learning called Value
Iteration with Perturbed Rewards (VIPeR), which amalgamates the pessimism
principle with random perturbations of the value function. Most current offline
RL algorithms explicitly construct statistical confidence regions to obtain
pessimism via lower confidence bounds (LCB), which cannot easily scale to
complex problems where a neural network is used to estimate the value
functions. Instead, VIPeR implicitly obtains pessimism by simply perturbing the
offline data multiple times with carefully-designed i.i.d. Gaussian noises to
learn an ensemble of estimated state-action {value functions} and acting
greedily with respect to the minimum of the ensemble. The estimated
state-action values are obtained by fitting a parametric model (e.g., neural
networks) to the perturbed datasets using gradient descent. As a result, VIPeR
only needs $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time complexity for action selection, while
LCB-based algorithms require at least $\Omega(K^2)$, where $K$ is the total
number of trajectories in the offline data. We also propose a novel
data-splitting technique that helps remove a factor involving the log of the
covering number in our bound. We prove that VIPeR yields a provable uncertainty
quantifier with overparameterized neural networks and enjoys a bound on
sub-optimality of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( { \kappa H^{5/2} \tilde{d}
}/{\sqrt{K}})$, where $\tilde{d}$ is the effective dimension, $H$ is the
horizon length and $\kappa$ measures the distributional shift. We corroborate
the statistical and computational efficiency of VIPeR with an empirical
evaluation on a wide set of synthetic and real-world datasets. To the best of
our knowledge, VIPeR is the first algorithm for offline RL that is provably
efficient for general Markov decision processes (MDPs) with neural network

introducing a self-checking procedure to ensure that generated examples retain
the semantic content of the original text. Experimental results on multiple

proposed to simulate sensor measurements generated by neural activity. While
this approach possesses a rigorous foundation and produces accurate results,
its major downside is that it is computationally prohibitively expensive in
practical applications. To overcome this, we developed a new approach, called
the localized subtraction approach. This approach is designed to preserve the
mathematical foundation of the subtraction approach, while also leading to
sparse right-hand sides in the FEM formulation, making it efficiently
computable. We achieve this by introducing a cut-off into the subtraction,
restricting its influence to the immediate neighborhood of the source. In this
work, this approach will be presented, analyzed, and compared to other
state-of-the-art FEM right-hand side approaches. Furthermore, we discuss how to
arrive at an efficient and stable implementation. We perform validation in
multi-layer sphere models where analytical solutions exist. There, we
demonstrate that the localized subtraction approach is vastly more efficient
than the subtraction approach. Moreover, we find that for the EEG forward
problem, the localized subtraction approach is less dependent on the global
structure of the FEM mesh when compared to the subtraction approach.
Additionally, we show the localized subtraction approach to rival, and in many
cases even surpass, the other investigated approaches in terms of accuracy. For
the MEG forward problem, we show the localized subtraction approach and the
subtraction approach to produce highly accurate approximations of the volume
currents close to the source. The localized subtraction approach thus reduces
the computational cost of the subtraction approach to an extent that makes it
usable in practical applications without sacrificing rigorousness and accuracy.

Under a monotonicity assumption we can also prove uniqueness of the limit

consider a geometric evolution corresponding to the $L^1$-gradient flow of the
anisotropic perimeter. When the initial set is convex, we show that the limit
solution is monotone for the inclusion, convex and unique until it reaches the
Cheeger set of the initial datum. Eventually, we show with some examples that

barred galaxies with a stellar mass $\logMstar > 10$ at $z=0$. We search for
box/peanut bulges (BPs) in this sample, finding them in 55\% of cases. We
compute $\fbp$, the BP probability for barred galaxies as a function of
$\Mstar$, and find that this rises to a plateau, as found in observations of
nearby galaxies. The transition mass where $\fbp$ reaches half the plateau
value is $\logMstar = 10.14$, consistent with the observational value within
measurement errors. We show that this transition in $\fbp$ can be attributed to
the youth of the bars at low $\Mstar$, which is a consequence of downsizing of
galaxies. Young bars, being generally shorter and weaker, have not yet had time
to form BPs. At high mass, while we find a plateau, the value is at $\sim 60\%$
whereas observations saturate at $100\%$. We attribute this difference to
excessive heating in TNG50, due to merger activity and to numerical resolution
effects. BPs in TNG50 tend to occur in galaxies with more quiescent merger
histories. As a result, the main driver of whether a bar hosts a BP in TNG50 is
not the galaxy mass, but how long and strong the bar is. Separating the BP
sample into those that have visibly buckled and those that have not, we find
that fully half of BP galaxies show clear signs of buckling, despite the
excessive heating and limited vertical resolution of TNG50.

  2023, Springer",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  By virtue of the Noether theorems, the vast gauge redundancy of general
relativity provides us with a rich algebra of boundary charges that generate
physical symmetries. These charges are located at codimension-2 entangling
surfaces called corners. The presence of non-trivial corner symmetries
associated with any entangling cut provides stringent constraints on the
theory's mathematical structure and a guide through quantization. This report
reviews new and recent results for non-perturbative quantum gravity, which are
natural consequences of this structure. First, we establish that the corner
symmetry derived from the gauge principle encodes quantum entanglement across
internal boundaries. We also explain how the quantum representation of the
corner symmetry algebra provides us with a notion of quantum geometry. We then
focus our discussion on the first-order formulation of gravity and show how
many results obtained in the continuum connect naturally with previous results
in loop quantum gravity. In particular, we show that it is possible to get,
purely from quantization and without discretization, an area operator with
discrete spectrum, which is covariant under local Lorentz symmetry. We
emphasize that while loop gravity correctly captures some of the gravitational
quantum numbers, it does not capture all of them, which points towards
important directions for future developments. Finally, we discuss the
understanding of the gravitational dynamics along null surfaces as a
conservation of symmetry charges associated with a Carrollian fluid.

considered a reliable way to assess participant-level treatment effect
modifiers but may not make the best use of the available data. Traditionally,
effect modifiers are explored one covariate at a time, which gives rise to the
possibility that evidence of treatment-covariate interaction may be due to
confounding from a different, related covariate. We aimed to evaluate current
practice when estimating treatment-covariate interactions in IPD meta-analysis,
specifically focusing on involvement of additional covariates in the models. We
reviewed 100 IPD meta-analyses of randomised trials, published between 2015 and
2020, that assessed at least one treatment-covariate interaction. We identified
four approaches to handling additional covariates: (1) Single interaction model
(unadjusted): No additional covariates included (57/100 studies); (2) Single
interaction model (adjusted): Adjustment for the main effect of at least one
additional covariate (35/100); (3) Multiple interactions model: Adjustment for
at least one two-way interaction between treatment and an additional covariate
(3/100); and (4) Three-way interaction model: Three-way interaction formed
between treatment, the additional covariate and the potential effect modifier
(5/100). IPD is not being utilised to its fullest extent. In an exemplar
dataset, we demonstrate how these approaches can lead to different conclusions.
Researchers should adjust for additional covariates when estimating
interactions in IPD meta-analysis providing they adjust their main effects,
which is already widely recommended. Further, they should consider whether more
complex approaches could provide better information on who might benefit most
from treatments, improving patient choice and treatment policy and practice.

$z=7.278$, JADES-GS+53.16746-27.7720 (shortened to JADES-GS-z7-LA), with
EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $\approx400 \pm 90$A and UV magnitude $-16.7$. The
spectroscopic redshift is confirmed via rest-frame optical lines [O II],
H$\beta$ and [O III] in its JWST/NIRSpec Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) spectrum.
The Ly$\alpha$ line is detected in both lower resolution ($R\sim100$) PRISM as
well as medium resolution ($R\sim1000$) G140M grating spectra. The Ly$\alpha$
FWHM in the grating is $\approx360$ km s$^{-1}$ and the line peaks within $120$
km s$^{-1}$ of the systemic redshift, indicative of very little neutral gas or
dust within the galaxy. We estimate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction to be
$\sim100\%$. JADES-GS-z7-LA has a [O III]/[O II] ratio (O32) of $8.8 \pm 1.1$
and ([O III]+[O II])/H$\beta$ ratio (R23) of $9.6\pm2.2$, consistent with low
metallicity and high ionization parameters. Deep NIRCam imaging also revealed a
close companion source (separated by $0.23''$), which exhibits similar
photometry to that of JADES-GS-z7-LA, with a photometric excess in the F410M
NIRCam image consistent with [O III]+H$\beta$ emission at the same redshift.
The spectral energy distribution of JADES-GS-z7-LA indicates a `bursty'
star-formation history, with a low stellar mass of $10^{7.15}$ M$_\odot$. The
only explanation of the high EW Ly$\alpha$ emission seen in JADES-GS-z7-LA is
if it resides in an ionized bubble with radius $\gtrsim 3$ pMpc. Owing to the
faint nature of JADES-GS-z7-LA, we show that it is incapable of single-handedly
ionizing a bubble large enough. Therefore, we suggest that JADES-GS-z7-LA (and
possibly the companion source) may be a part of a larger overdensity,
presenting direct evidence of overlapping ionized bubbles at $z>7$, allowing us
to study the process of reionization across both small and large scales.

group absorbs any unitary representation of the group when tensored with it. In
a weakened form, this result carries over to the left regular representation of
a right LCM submonoid of a group and its Nica covariant isometric
representations but it fails if the semigroup does not satisfy independence. In
this paper we explain how to extend Fell's absorption principle to an arbitrary
submonoid $P$ of a group $G$ by using an enhanced version of the left regular
representation. Li's semigroup $C^*$-algebra $C^*_s(P)$ and its representations
appear naturally in our context. Using the enhanced left regular
representation, we not only provide a very concrete presentation for the
reduced object for $C^*_s(P)$ but we also obtain very transparent proofs of
earlier results. We also address the non-selfadjoint theory and we show that
the non-selfadjoint object attached to the enhanced left regular representation
coincides with that of the left regular representation. We obtain a
non-selfadjoint version of Fell's absorption principle involving the tensor
algebra of a semigroup and we use it to improve recent results of Clouatre and
Dor-On on the residual finite dimensionality of certain $C^*$-algebras
associated with such tensor algebras. We also give yet another proof for the

classification tasks. However, existing GNNs naturally bias towards the
majority classes with more labelled data and ignore those minority classes with
relatively few labelled ones. The traditional techniques often resort
over-sampling methods, but they may cause overfitting problem. More recently,
some works propose to synthesize additional nodes for minority classes from the
labelled nodes, however, there is no any guarantee if those generated nodes
really stand for the corresponding minority classes. In fact, improperly
synthesized nodes may result in insufficient generalization of the algorithm.
To resolve the problem, in this paper we seek to automatically augment the
minority classes from the massive unlabelled nodes of the graph. Specifically,
we propose \textit{GraphSR}, a novel self-training strategy to augment the
minority classes with significant diversity of unlabelled nodes, which is based
on a Similarity-based selection module and a Reinforcement Learning(RL)
selection module. The first module finds a subset of unlabelled nodes which are
most similar to those labelled minority nodes, and the second one further
determines the representative and reliable nodes from the subset via RL
technique. Furthermore, the RL-based module can adaptively determine the
sampling scale according to current training data. This strategy is general and
can be easily combined with different GNNs models. Our experiments demonstrate
the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on various

\tau_3(n+h)$ for various ranges of $h$ is an important problem in number theory
in the past a hundred years and is still wide open. We believe, however, that
the above correlation sum is too strong for applications. More specifically, if

is of vital importance for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Qubit frequency
allocation is an essential part of improving control fidelity. A metric for
qubit frequency allocation, frequency collision, has been proposed on simple
systems of only a few qubits driven by a mono-modal microwave drive. However,
frequency allocation for quantum processors for more advanced purposes, such as
quantum error correction, needs further investigation. In this study, we
propose a Floquet analysis of frequency collisions. The key to our proposed
method is a reinterpretation of frequency collisions as an unintended
degeneracy of Floquet states, which allows a collision analysis on more complex
systems with many qubits driven by multi-modal microwave drives. Although the
Floquet state is defined in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, we develop
algorithms, based on operation perturbation theory, to truncate the Hilbert
space down to the optimal computational complexity. In particular, we show that
the computational complexity of the collision analysis for a sparse qubit
lattice is linear with the number of qubits. Finally, we demonstrate our
proposed method on Cross-Resonance based experimental protocols. We first study
the Cross-Resonance gate in an isolated three-qubit system, where the
effectiveness of our method is verified by comparing it with previous studies.
We next consider the more complex problem of syndrome extraction in the

predict that Dark Matter (DM) haloes are typically prolate in their centres and
spheroidal towards their outskirts. The addition of gas cooling transforms the
central DM shape to be rounder and more oblate. It is not clear, however,
whether such shape transformations occur in `ultra-faint' dwarfs, which have
extremely low baryon fractions. We present the first study of the shape and
velocity anisotropy of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies that have gas mass fractions
of $f_{\rm gas}(r<R_{\rm half}) < 0.06$. These dwarfs are drawn from the
Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge (EDGE) project, using high
resolution simulations (spatial and mass resolution of 3 pc and $120$
M$_\odot$, respectively) that allow us to resolve DM halo shapes within the
half light radius ($\sim 100$ pc). We show that gas-poor ultra-faints ($M_{\rm
200c} \leqslant 1.5\times10^9$ M$_\odot$; $f_{\rm gas} < 10^{-5}$) retain their
pristine prolate DM halo shape even when gas, star formation and feedback are
included. This could provide a new and robust test of DM models. By contrast,
gas-rich ultra-faints ($M_{\rm 200c} > 3\times10^9$ M$_\odot$; $f_{\rm gas} >
10^{-4}$) become rounder and more oblate within $\sim 10$ half light radii.
Finally, we find that most of our simulated dwarfs have significant radial
velocity anisotropy that rises to $\tilde{\beta} > 0.5$ at $R \gtrsim 3 R_{\rm
half}$. The one exception is a dwarf that forms a rotating gas/stellar disc
because of a planar, major merger. Such strong anisotropy should be taken into
account when building mass models of gas-poor ultra-faints.

creates barriers to applications of CoT prompting to these general tasks. This
paper proposes a new strategy, Automate-CoT (Automatic Prompt Augmentation and

automatically augmenting rational chains from a small labeled dataset, and then
pruning low-quality chains to construct a candidate pool of machine-generated
rationale chains based on the labels. Finally, it selects the optimal
combination of several rationale chains from the pool for CoT prompting by
employing a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to estimate the
significance of each example in a black-box language model. Automate-CoT
enables a quick adaptation of the CoT technique to different tasks.

Combined with the age and orbital constraints, the observed disk structures
provide insights into the evolutionary history and the impact of the stellar
companions. The small grains in CHX 22 form a tail-like structure surrounding
the close binary, which likely results from a close encounter and capture of a
cloudlet. S CrA shows intricate structures (tentative ringed and spiral
features) in the circumprimary disk as a possible consequence of perturbations
by companions. The circumsecondary disk is truncated and connected to the
primary disk via a streamer, suggesting tidal interactions. In HP Cha, the
primary disk is less disturbed and features a tenuous streamer, through which
the material flows towards the companions. The comparison of the three systems
spans a wide range of binary separation (50 - 500 au) and illustrates the
decreasing influence on disk structures with the distance of companions. This
agrees with the statistical analysis of exoplanet population in binaries, that
planet formation is likely obstructed around close binary systems, while it is

individual resonators near the boundary of the metasurface and deduce that

neural networks (GNNs), neural cellular automata on graphs, and prediction of
scenes with multiple objects. Yet existing approaches to set encoding and
decoding tasks present a host of issues, including non-permutation-invariance,
fixed-length outputs, reliance on iterative methods, non-deterministic outputs,
computationally expensive loss functions, and poor reconstruction accuracy. In
this paper we introduce a Permutation-Invariant Set Autoencoder (PISA), which
tackles these problems and produces encodings with significantly lower
reconstruction error than existing baselines. PISA also provides other
desirable properties, including a similarity-preserving latent space, and the
ability to insert or remove elements from the encoding. After evaluating PISA
against baseline methods, we demonstrate its usefulness in a multi-agent
application. Using PISA as a subcomponent, we introduce a novel GNN
architecture which serves as a generalised communication scheme, allowing
agents to use communication to gain full observability of a system.

allows us to place people in the same world coordinate frame. Most existing

pixels to infer 3D human motion usually require a full scene reconstruction,
which is often not possible for in-the-wild videos. However, even when existing
SLAM systems cannot recover accurate scene reconstructions, the background
pixel motion still provides enough signal to constrain the camera motion. We
show that relative camera estimates along with data-driven human motion priors
can resolve the scene scale ambiguity and recover global human trajectories.
Our method robustly recovers the global 3D trajectories of people in
challenging in-the-wild videos, such as PoseTrack. We quantify our improvement
over existing methods on 3D human dataset Egobody. We further demonstrate that
our recovered camera scale allows us to reason about motion of multiple people
in a shared coordinate frame, which improves performance of downstream tracking
in PoseTrack. Code and video results can be found at

bright radio emission and impact the surface chemistry of close-in moons.
Recent observations confirm planet-like radio emission such as aurorae from
large-scale magnetospheric current systems on very low mass stars and brown
dwarfs. These objects, collectively known as ultracool dwarfs, also exhibit
quiescent radio emission hypothesized to trace stellar coronal flare activity
or extrasolar radiation belt analogs. Here we present high resolution imaging
of the ultracool dwarf LSR J1835+3259 demonstrating that this radio emission is
spatially resolved and traces a long-lived, double-lobed, and axisymmetric
structure similar in morphology to the Jovian radiation belts. Up to 18
ultracool dwarf radii separate the two lobes. This structure is stably present

maximising the total entropy and the quadrupole mean-field approximation, we
determine the equilibrium distribution of axisymmetric two-component
gravitating systems with two distinct masses, semimajor axes, and
eccentricities. We also examine the limiting case when one of the components
dominates over the total energy and angular momentum, approximately acting as a
heat bath, which may represent the surrounding astrophysical environment such
as the tidal perturbation from the galaxy, a massive perturber, a gas torus, or
a nearby stellar system. Remarkably, the bodies above a critical mass in the
subdominant component condense into a disk in a ubiquitous way. We identify the

from January-August 2022, as well as continued optical monitoring during the
same time period. We find no evidence of periodic/quasi-periodic modulation in
the X-ray, UV, or optical bands, however we do observe exotic hard X-ray
variability that is unusual for a typical AGN. The most striking feature of the
NICER light curve is repetitive hard (2-4 keV) X-ray flares that result in
distinctly harder X-ray spectra compared to the non-flaring data. In its
non-flaring state, AT2019cuk looks like a relatively standard AGN, but it
presents the first case of day-long, hard X-ray flares in a changing-look AGN.
We consider a few different models for the driving mechanism of these hard
X-ray flares, including: (1) corona/jet variability driven by increased
magnetic activity, (2) variable obscuration, and (3) self-lensing from the
potential secondary SMBH. We prefer the variable corona model, as the
obscuration model requires rather contrived timescales and the self-lensing
model is difficult to reconcile with a lack of clear periodicity in the flares.
These findings illustrate how important high-cadence X-ray monitoring is to our
understanding of the rapid variability of the X-ray corona and necessitate
further high-cadence, multi-wavelength monitoring of changing-look AGN like
AT2019cuk to probe the corona-jet connection.

$\sim1\times10^{-20}\mathrm{~erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}~arcsec^{-2}}$ in Ly$\alpha$,
reaching the expected level of optically thick gas illuminated by the UV
background at $z\sim3$. Fitting of the two-component exponential function gives
the scale-lengths of $1.56\pm0.01$ and $10.4\pm0.3$ pkpc. Dividing the sample
according to their photometric properties, we find that while the dependence of
halo scale-length on environment outside of the protocluster core is not clear,
LAEs in the central regions of protoclusters appear to have very large LAHs
which could be caused by combined effects of source overlapping and diffuse
Ly$\alpha$ emission from cool intergalactic gas permeating the forming
protocluster core irradiated by active members. For the first time, we identify
``UV halos'' around bright LAEs which are probably due to a few lower-mass
satellite galaxies. Through comparison with recent numerical simulations, we
conclude that, while scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons from the host galaxies are
dominant, star formation in satellites evidently contributes to LAHs, and that
fluorescent Ly$\alpha$ emission may be boosted within protocluster cores at

future-directed timelike and spatially bound geodesics in the exterior of a

action-angle variables, we analyze the large time asymptotic behavior of
macroscopic observables associated with the gas. We show that, as long as the
fundamental frequencies of the system satisfy a suitable non-degeneracy
condition, these macroscopic observables converge in time to the corresponding
observables determined from an averaged distribution function. In particular,
this implies that the final state is characterized by a distribution function
which is invariant with respect to the full symmetry group of the system, that
is, it is stationary, axisymmetric and Poisson-commutes with the integral of
motion associated with the Carter constant. As a corollary of our result, we
demonstrate the validity of the strong Jeans theorem in our setting, stating
that the distribution function belonging to a stationary state must be a
function which is independent of the generalized angle variables. An analogous
theorem in which the assumption of stationarity is replaced with the
requirement of invariance with respect to the Carter flow is also proven.
Finally, we prove that the aforementioned non-degeneracy condition holds. This
is achieved by providing suitable asymptotic expansions for the energy and
Carter constant in terms of action variables for orbits having sufficiently
large radii, and by exploiting the analytic dependency of the fundamental
frequencies on the integrals of motion.

bursts and kilonova afterglows. For modeling the former, we consider

profiles from numerical-relativity simulations. We find that the kilonova
afterglow sky map has a doughnut-like structure at early times that becomes
more ring-like at late times. This is caused by the fact that the synchrotron
emission from electrons following Maxwellian distribution function dominates
the early, beamed, emission while emissions from electrons following power-law
distribution is important at late times. For an on-axis observer, the image
flux centroid moves on the image plane initially away from the observer. Flux
centroid displacement The image sizes, we find, are the largest for equal mass
merger simulations with the soft equation of state. The presence of a kilonova
afterglow affects the properties inferred from the source sky map even if the
gamma-ray burst afterglow dominates the total flux density. The main effect is
the reduction of the mean apparent velocity of the source, and an increase in
the source size. Thus, neglecting the presence of the kilonova afterglow may
lead to systematic errors in the inference of gamma-ray burst properties from
the sky map observations. Notably, at the observing angle inferred for

plays the role of a semi-classical limit. Certain universal observables, such
as conformal blocks involving the exchange of the identity operator, can be
expanded around this classical limit in powers of the central charge $c$. This
expansion is an asymptotic series, so - via the same resurgence analysis
familiar from quantum mechanics - necessitates the existence of
non-perturbative effects. In the case of identity conformal blocks, these new
effects have a simple interpretation: the CFT must possess new primary
operators with dimension of order the central charge. This constrains the data
of CFTs with large central charge in a way that is similar to (but distinct
from) the conformal bootstrap. We study this phenomenon in three ways:
numerically, analytically using Zamolodchikov's recursion relations, and by
considering non-unitary minimal models with large (negative) central charge. In
the holographic dual to a CFT$_2$, the expansion in powers of $c$ is the
perturbative loop expansion in powers of $\hbar$. So our results imply that the
graviton loop expansion is an asymptotic series, whose cure requires the
inclusion of new saddle points in the gravitational path integral. In certain
cases these saddle points have a simple interpretation: they are conical
excesses, particle-like states with negative mass which are not in the physical
spectrum but nevertheless appear as non-manifold saddle points that control the
asymptotic behaviour of the loop expansion. This phenomenon also has an
interpretation in $SL(2,{\mathbb R})$ Chern-Simons theory, where the

  Arun Debray",,,,"hep-th math.AT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  2-group symmetries arise in physics when a 0-form symmetry $G^{[0]}$ and a
1-form symmetry $H^{[1]}$ intertwine, forming a generalised group-like
structure. Specialising to the case where both $G^{[0]}$ and $H^{[1]}$ are
compact, connected, abelian groups (i.e. tori), we analyse anomalies in such
`toric 2-group symmetries' using the cobordism classification. As a warm up
example, we use cobordism to study various 't Hooft anomalies (and the phases
to which they are dual) in Maxwell theory defined on non-spin manifolds. For
our main example, we compute the 5th spin bordism group of $B|\mathbb{G}|$
where $\mathbb{G}$ is any 2-group whose 0-form and 1-form symmetry parts are
both $\mathrm{U}(1)$, and $|\mathbb{G}|$ is the geometric realisation of the
nerve of the 2-group $\mathbb{G}$. By leveraging a variety of algebraic
methods, we show that $\Omega^{\mathrm{Spin}}_5(B|\mathbb{G}|) \cong
\mathbb{Z}/m$ where $m$ is the modulus of the Postnikov class for $\mathbb{G}$,
and we reproduce the expected physics result for anomalies in 2-group
symmetries that appear in 4d QED. Moving down two dimensions, we recap that any
(anomalous) $\mathrm{U}(1)$ global symmetry in 2d can be enhanced to a toric
2-group symmetry, before showing that its associated local anomaly reduces to
at most an order 2 anomaly, when the theory is defined with a spin structure.

penalized splines makes the extension to multivariate outcomes relatively

additionally be interactive, i.e. changing their behavior according to the
behavior of other entities. The perception and prediction modules of robotic
systems create probabilistic representations and predictions of such

trajectory planning algorithm that probabilistically avoids collisions against
static and interactive dynamic obstacles, and produces dynamically feasible
trajectories. During decision making, our planner simulates the interactive
behavior of dynamic obstacles in response to the actions planning robot takes.
We explicitly minimize collision probabilities against static and dynamic
obstacles using a multi-objective search formulation. Then, we formulate a
quadratic program to safely fit a smooth trajectory to the search result while
attempting to preserve the collision probabilities computed during search. We
evaluate our algorithm extensively in simulations to show its performance under
different environments and configurations using 78000 randomly generated cases.

examined. We first evaluate the model under consideration's thermodynamic

9100] and from the literature for a sample of 45 nearby ($z$ < 0.08) Sy 2s were
considered. Our direct estimates indicate that Sy 2s have similar temperatures
in the gas region where most of the S+ ions are located in comparison with that
of star-forming regions (SFs). However, Sy 2s present higher temperature values
($\sim$10000 K) in the region where most of the S++ ions are located relative
to that of SFs. We derive the total sulphur abundance in the range of 6.2 < 12
+ log(S/H) < 7.5, corresponding to 0.1-1.8 times the solar value. These sulphur
abundance values are lower by $\sim$0.4 dex than those derived in SFs with
similar metallicity, indicating a distinct chemical enrichment of the ISM for
these object classes. The S/O values for our Sy 2 sample present an abrupt
($\sim$0.5 dex) decrease with increasing O/H for the high metallicity regime
[12 + log(O/H) > 8.7)], what is not seen for the SFs. However, when our Sy 2
estimates are combined with those from a large sample of star-forming regions,
we did not find any dependence between S/O and O/H.

Extended version of USENIX Security'23 paper",,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fuzzing has gained in popularity for software vulnerability detection by
virtue of the tremendous effort to develop a diverse set of fuzzers. Thanks to
various fuzzing techniques, most of the fuzzers have been able to demonstrate
great performance on their selected targets. However, paradoxically, this
diversity in fuzzers also made it difficult to select fuzzers that are best
suitable for complex real-world programs, which we call selection burden.
Communities attempted to address this problem by creating a set of standard
benchmarks to compare and contrast the performance of fuzzers for a wide range
of applications, but the result was always a suboptimal decision - the
best-performing fuzzer on average does not guarantee the best outcome for the
target of a user's interest.
  To overcome this problem, we propose an automated, yet non-intrusive
meta-fuzzer, called autofz, to maximize the benefits of existing
state-of-the-art fuzzers via dynamic composition. To an end user, this means
that, instead of spending time on selecting which fuzzer to adopt, one can
simply put all of the available fuzzers to autofz, and achieve the best,
optimal result. The key idea is to monitor the runtime progress of the fuzzers,
called trends (similar in concept to gradient descent), and make a fine-grained
adjustment of resource allocation. This is a stark contrast to existing
approaches - autofz deduces a suitable set of fuzzers of the active workload in
a fine-grained manner at runtime. Our evaluation shows that autofz outperforms
any best-performing individual fuzzers in 11 out of 12 available benchmarks and
beats the best, collaborative fuzzing approaches in 19 out of 20 benchmarks.
Moreover, on average, autofz found 152% more bugs than individual fuzzers, and
415% more bugs than collaborative fuzzing.

probabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to
gradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning
the reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence
to efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive
number of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to
designated nonlinear constitutive responses. To identify the subset of
microstructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a
convolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity
finite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible
range. The results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process
is capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material
properties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, the
resulting algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional
topological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional
structures embedded in the latent space. The algorithm is tested on the
open-source mechanical MNIST data set. Consequently, this algorithm is not only
capable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media but also
learns the nonlinear structure-property map to quantitatively understand the

the dimensions of spacetime, the Lifshitz exponent, and the hyperscaling

a challenging problem that has received extensive attention from the computer
vision community. Many learning-based approaches tackle this problem by
learning a 3D shape prior from either ground truth 3D data or multi-view
observations. To achieve state-of-the-art results, these methods assume that
the objects are specified with respect to a fixed canonical coordinate frame,
where instances of the same category are perfectly aligned. In this work, we
present a new method for joint category-specific 3D reconstruction and object
pose estimation from a single image. We show that one can leverage shape priors
learned on purely synthetic 3D data together with a point cloud pose
canonicalization method to achieve high-quality 3D reconstruction in the wild.
Given a single depth image at test time, we first transform this partial point
cloud into a learned canonical frame. Then, we use a neural deformation field
to reconstruct the 3D surface of the object. Finally, we jointly optimize
object pose and 3D shape to fit the partial depth observation. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance across several real-world
datasets, even when trained only on synthetic data. We further show that our
method generalizes to different input modalities, from dense depth images to

in the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a
cryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by
a multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior
works showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for

observations with NICER and XMM revealed an X-ray state ten times fainter than
historical observations, consistent with the presence of a new dust-free,
ionized obscurer. The following analysis of NICER spectra attributes
variability in the observed X-ray flux to changes in both the column density of
the obscurer by at least one order of magnitude ($N_\mathrm{H}$ ranges from
$2.85\substack{+0.48\\ -0.33} \times 10^{22}\text{ cm}^{-2}$ to

continuum brightness (the unobscured flux ranges from $10^{-11.8}$ to
$10^{-10.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ ). While the X-ray flux generally remains
in a faint state, there is one large flare during which Mrk 817 returns to its
historical mean flux. The obscuring gas is still present at lower column
density during the flare but it also becomes highly ionized, increasing its
transparency. Correlation between the column density of the X-ray obscurer and
the strength of UV broad absorption lines suggests that the X-ray and UV
continua are both affected by the same obscuration, consistent with a clumpy
disk wind launched from the inner broad line region.

agents that share a common policy and take into account information from

impairing network performance during the initial stages of learning, agents are
pre-trained in an earlier phase of offline learning. During this phase, an
initial policy is obtained using feedback from a static network simulator and
considering a wide variety of scenarios. Finally, agents can intelligently tune
the cell parameters of a test network by suggesting small incremental changes,
slowly guiding the network toward an optimal configuration. The agents propose
optimal changes using the experience gained with the simulator in the
pre-training phase, but they can also continue to learn from current network
readings after each change. The results show how the proposed approach
significantly improves the performance gains already provided by expert
system-based methods when applied to remote antenna tilt optimization. The
significant gains of this approach have truly been observed when compared with
a similar method in which the state and reward do not incorporate information

missions considering the commonality is presented. The procedure aims to take
full advantage of sharing a common part across multiple rockets whose payload
capability differs entirely, ultimately leading to cost savings in designing a
rocket family. As the foundation of the proposed rocket family design method,
an integrated sizing method with trajectory optimization for a single rocket is
first formulated as a single optimal control problem. This formulation can find
the optimal sizing along with trajectory results in a tractable manner.
Building upon this formulation, the proposed rocket family design method is
developed to (1) determine the feasible design space of the rocket family
design problem (i.e., commonality check); and (2) if a feasible design space is
determined to exist, minimize the cost function within that feasible space by
solving an optimization problem in which the optimal control problem is
embedded as subproblems. A case study is carried out on a rocket family
composed of expendable and reusable launchers to demonstrate the novelty of the
proposed procedure.

related to the tissue microstructure. Among different QUS parameters, scatterer
number density has been found to be a reliable biomarker for detecting
different abnormalities. The homodyned K-distribution (HK-distribution) is a
model for the probability density function of the ultrasound echo amplitude
that can model different scattering scenarios but requires a large number of
samples to be estimated reliably. Parametric images of HK-distribution
parameters can be formed by dividing the envelope data into small overlapping
patches and estimating parameters within the patches independently. This
approach imposes two limiting constraints, the HK-distribution parameters are
assumed to be constant within each patch, and each patch requires enough
independent samples. In order to mitigate those problems, we employ a deep
learning approach to estimate parametric images of scatterer number density
(related to HK-distribution shape parameter) without patching. Furthermore, an
uncertainty map of the network's prediction is quantified to provide insight
about the confidence of the network about the estimated HK parameter values.

known as stochastic minimax optimization) can be solved under the constraint of
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy with \emph{strong (primal-dual) gap}
rate of $\tilde O\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} + \frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon}\big)$,
where $n$ is the dataset size and $d$ is the dimension of the problem. This
rate is nearly optimal, based on existing lower bounds in differentially
private stochastic optimization. Specifically, we prove a tight upper bound on
the strong gap via novel implementation and analysis of the recursive
regularization technique repurposed for saddle point problems. We show that
this rate can be attained with
$O\big(\min\big\{\frac{n^2\epsilon^{1.5}}{\sqrt{d}}, n^{3/2}\big\}\big)$
gradient complexity, and $O(n)$ gradient complexity if the loss function is
smooth. As a byproduct of our method, we develop a general algorithm that,
given a black-box access to a subroutine satisfying a certain $\alpha$
primal-dual accuracy guarantee with respect to the empirical objective, gives a
solution to the stochastic saddle point problem with a strong gap of
$\tilde{O}(\alpha+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$. We show that this $\alpha$-accuracy
condition is satisfied by standard algorithms for the empirical saddle point
problem such as the proximal point method and the stochastic gradient descent
ascent algorithm. Further, we show that even for simple problems it is possible
for an algorithm to have zero weak gap and suffer from $\Omega(1)$ strong gap.
We also show that there exists a fundamental tradeoff between stability and
accuracy. Specifically, we show that any $\Delta$-stable algorithm has
empirical gap $\Omega\big(\frac{1}{\Delta n}\big)$, and that this bound is
tight. This result also holds also more specifically for empirical risk
minimization problems and may be of independent interest.

application of deep learning models in the {\em Knowledge Tracing} (KT)
problem. However, there has been the lack of understanding on the issue in the
literature. %are not sufficient studies tackling this problem. In this work, to
address this challenge, we adopt a subject-based training method to split and
impute data by student IDs instead of row number splitting which we call
non-subject based training. The benefit of subject-based training can retain
the complete sequence for each student and hence achieve efficient training.
Further, we leverage two existing deep generative frameworks, namely
variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Longitudinal Variational Autoencoders (LVAE)
frameworks and build LSTM kernels into them to form LSTM-VAE and LSTM LVAE
(noted as VAE and LVAE for simplicity) models to generate quality data. In
LVAE, a Gaussian Process (GP) model is trained to disentangle the correlation
between the subject (i.e., student) descriptor information (e.g., age, gender)
and the latent space. The paper finally compare the model performance between
training the original data and training the data imputed with generated data
from non-subject based model VAE-NS and subject-based training models (i.e.,
VAE and LVAE). We demonstrate that the generated data from LSTM-VAE and
LSTM-LVAE can boost the original model performance by about 50%. Moreover, the
original model just needs 10% more student data to surpass the original
performance if the prediction model is small and 50\% more data if the
prediction model is large with our proposed frameworks.

after passing through large-scale structure, which changes the observed spectra
in important model-dependent ways. This is of particular concern given recent
claims of significant discrepancies with low redshift data sets when a standard
$\Lambda$CDM model is assumed. By using empirical measurements of the CMB
lensing reconstruction, combined with weak priors on the smoothness of the
lensing spectrum, foregrounds, and shape of any additional integrated
Sachs-Wolfe effect, we show how the early-universe parameters can be
constrained from CMB observations almost independently of the late-time
evolution. This provides a way to test new models for early-universe physics,
and measure early-universe parameters, independently of late-time cosmology.
Using the empirical measurement of lensing keeps the size of the effect of
late-time modelling uncertainty under control, leading to only modest increases
in error bars of most early-universe parameters compared to assuming a full
evolution model. We provide robust constraints on early-$\Lambda$CDM model
parameters using the latest Planck PR4 data and show that with future data
marginalizing over a single lensing amplitude parameter is sufficient to remove
sensitivity to late-time cosmological model only if the spectral shape matches
predictions.

fully occluded by other objects? Prior works propose geometric approaches for

restaurant kitchens, and grocery stores are often organized such that
semantically similar objects are placed close to one another. Can large
language models (LLMs) serve as semantic knowledge sources to accelerate
robotic mechanical search in semantically arranged environments? With Semantic
Spatial Search on Shelves (S^4), we use LLMs to generate affinity matrices,
where entries correspond to semantic likelihood of physical proximity between
objects. We derive semantic spatial distributions by synthesizing semantics
with learned geometric constraints. S^4 incorporates Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) and semantic refinement with predictions from ViLD, an
open-vocabulary object detection model. Simulation experiments suggest that
semantic spatial search reduces the search time relative to pure spatial search
by an average of 24% across three domains: pharmacy, kitchen, and office
shelves. A manually collected dataset of 100 semantic scenes suggests that OCR
and semantic refinement improve object detection accuracy by 35%. Lastly,
physical experiments in a pharmacy shelf suggest 47.1% improvement over pure
spatial search. Supplementary material can be found at

The curse of high-dimensional data samples. These limit the detection
performance and usefulness of existing works. To address them, we propose a new
approach called deep graph stream support vector data description (SVDD) for
anomaly detection. Specifically, we first use a transformer to preserve both
short and long temporal patterns of monitoring data in temporal embeddings.
Then we cluster these embeddings according to sensor type and utilize them to
estimate the change in connectivity between various sensors to construct a new
weighted graph. The temporal embeddings are mapped to the new graph as node
attributes to form weighted attributed graph. We input the graph into a
variational graph auto-encoder model to learn final spatio-temporal
representation. Finally, we learn a hypersphere that encompasses normal
embeddings and predict the system status by calculating the distances between
the hypersphere and data samples. Extensive experiments validate the
superiority of our model, which improves F1-score by 35.87%, AUC by 19.32%,

confirmed or suspected thoracic pathology. Proper patient positioning is more
challenging in canine and feline radiography than in humans due to less patient
cooperation and body shape variation. Improper patient positioning during
radiograph acquisition has the potential to lead to a misdiagnosis.
Asymmetrical hemithoraces are one of the indications of obliquity for which we
propose an automatic classification method.
  Approach: We propose a hemithoraces segmentation method based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and active contours. We utilized the U-Net
model to segment the ribs and spine and then utilized active contours to find
left and right hemithoraces. We then extracted features from the left and right
hemithoraces to train an ensemble classifier which includes Support Vector
Machine, Gradient Boosting and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Five-fold
cross-validation was used, thorax segmentation was evaluated by Intersection
over Union (IoU), and symmetry classification was evaluated using Precision,
Recall, Area under Curve and F1 score.
  Results: Classification of symmetry for 900 radiographs reported an F1 score
of 82.8% . To test the robustness of the proposed thorax segmentation method to
underexposure and overexposure, we synthetically corrupted properly exposed
radiographs and evaluated results using IoU. The results showed that the models
IoU for underexposure and overexposure dropped by 2.1% and 1.2%, respectively.
  Conclusions: Our results indicate that the proposed thorax segmentation
method is robust to poor exposure radiographs. The proposed thorax segmentation
method can be applied to human radiography with minimal changes.

to increased usage of remote proctoring tools that are designed to monitor
students when they take assessments outside the classroom. While prior work has
explored students' privacy and security concerns regarding online proctoring
tools, the perspective of educators is under explored. Notably, educators are
the decision makers in the classrooms and choose which remote proctoring
services and the level of observations they deem appropriate. To explore how
educators balance the security and privacy of their students with the
requirements of remote exams, we sent survey requests to over 3,400 instructors
at a large private university that taught online classes during the 2020/21
academic year. We had n=125 responses: 21% of the educators surveyed used
online exam proctoring services during the remote learning period, and of
those, 35% plan to continue using the tools even when there is a full return to
in-person learning. Educators who use exam proctoring services are often
comfortable with their monitoring capabilities. However, educators are
concerned about students sharing certain types of information with exam
proctoring companies, particularly when proctoring services collect
identifiable information to validate students' identities. Our results suggest
that many educators developed alternative assessments that did not require
online proctoring and that those who did use online proctoring services often
considered the tradeoffs between the potential risks to student privacy and the
utility or necessity of exam proctoring services.

  Bhattacharyya","Constraint Optimization over Semirings","Appeared in AAAI 23",,,,"cs.LO cs.CC cs.DB","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Interpretations of logical formulas over semirings have applications in
various areas of computer science including logic, AI, databases, and security.
Such interpretations provide richer information beyond the truth or falsity of
a statement. Examples of such semirings include Viterbi semiring, min-max or
access control semiring, tropical semiring, and fuzzy semiring.
  The present work investigates the complexity of constraint optimization
problems over semirings. The generic optimization problem we study is the
following: Given a propositional formula $\varphi$ over $n$ variable and a
semiring $(K,+,\cdot,0,1)$, find the maximum value over all possible
interpretations of $\varphi$ over $K$. This can be seen as a generalization of
the well-known satisfiability problem. A related problem is to find an
interpretation that achieves the maximum value. In this work, we first focus on
these optimization problems over the Viterbi semiring, which we call optConfVal
and optConf.
  We show that for general propositional formulas in negation normal form,
optConfVal and optConf are in ${\mathrm{FP}}^{\mathrm{NP}}$. We investigate
optConf when the input formula $\varphi$ is represented as a CNF. For CNF
formulae, we first derive an upper bound on optConfVal as a function of the
number of maximum satisfiable clauses. In particular, we show that if $r$ is
the maximum number of satisfiable clauses in a CNF formula with $m$ clauses,
then its optConfVal is at most $1/4^{m-r}$. Building on this we establish that
optConfVal for CNF formulae is hard for the complexity class
${\mathrm{FP}}^{\mathrm{NP}[\log]}$. We also design polynomial-time
approximation algorithms and establish an inapproximability for optConfVal. We
establish similar complexity results for these optimization problems over other
semirings including tropical, fuzzy, and access control semirings.

the displacement-controlled model in buckling problems of structures and the
complexity of the asymptotic post-buckling analysis traditionally based on the
force-controlled model, alternatively, we provide a straightforward theoretical
procedure of the energy method for the buckling and post-buckling analysis
completely based on the displacement-controlled model. The Euler buckling
behavior is analytically tackled as a static displacement-controlled process as
an example of the theoretical procedure, where no force potential energy
component but compression and bending strain energy components are considered
precisely at the deformed configuration for the total potential energy of the
beams. Analytical solutions to the potential energy, structural deformation,
internal forces and their critical results are obtained in closed-form for the
beams with six typical boundary conditions. We find that these beams have only
one unique but universal normalized potential energy surface depending on two
dimensionless quantities. The valley bottom pathways on the potential energy
surface show that the critical buckling state is not only a bifurcation point
but also a valley-ridge inflection point, and the energy increases
quadratically before the point and increases linearly with a slope of 2 beyond
the point. The axial forces are gradually increasing during post-buckling, but
are almost constant, indicating a symmetric neutral bifurcation buckling. Our
theoretical expressions generally agree with the counterparts of the
force-controlled model but exactly indicate somewhat differences. The present
analytical procedure is basically useful to investigate any
displacement-controlled buckling problems of beams, plates and shells.

an unobserved resonance state at $E_\mathrm{x} = 8862$ keV ($E_\mathrm{r,c.m.}
= 68$ keV). Purpose: To study excited states in $^{23}$Na above the proton
threshold to determine if this resonance state, and other unconfirmed resonance
states in $^{23}$Na, exist. Methods: The non-selective proton inelastic
scattering reaction at low energies was used to search for excited states in
$^{23}$Na above the proton threshold. Protons scattered from various targets
were momentum-analysed in the Q3D magnetic spectrograph at the Maier-Leibnitz
Laboratorium, Munich, Germany. Results: The resonance states reported at
$E_\mathrm{x} = 8862$, $8894$ and $9000$ keV were not observed in the present
experiment at any angle. This result, combined with other non-observations of
these resonance states in other reactions, results in a strong presumption
against the existence of these resonance states. Conclusions: The previously
reported resonance states at $E_\mathrm{x} = 8862$, $8894$ and $9000$ keV are
unlikely to exist and should be omitted from future evaluations of the
$^{22}$Ne($p,\gamma$)$^{23}$Na reaction rates. Indirect studies using
low-energy proton inelastic scattering are a simple and yet exceptionally
powerful tool in helping to constrain astrophysical reaction rates by providing
non-selective information of the excited states of nuclei.

Therefore, it was quite surprising when a recent work
\cite{kane2022computational} showed a computational-statistical gap for linear
reinforcement learning: even though there are polynomial sample-complexity
algorithms, unless NP = RP, there are no polynomial time algorithms for this
setting.
  In this work, we build on their result to show a computational lower bound,
which is exponential in feature dimension and horizon, for linear reinforcement
learning under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis. To prove this we
build a round-based game where in each round the learner is searching for an
unknown vector in a unit hypercube. The rewards in this game are chosen such
that if the learner achieves large reward, then the learner's actions can be
used to simulate solving a variant of 3-SAT, where (a) each variable shows up
in a bounded number of clauses (b) if an instance has no solutions then it also
has no solutions that satisfy more than (1-$\epsilon$)-fraction of clauses. We
use standard reductions to show this 3-SAT variant is approximately as hard as
3-SAT. Finally, we also show a lower bound optimized for horizon dependence
that almost matches the best known upper bound of $\exp(\sqrt{H})$.

that each symbol occurs exactly once in each row and column. For an odd prime

cellular processes, most notably shape change, division and locomotion. These
forces may be transmitted over long range through the cytoskeletal medium - a
disordered, viscoelastic network of biopolymers. The resulting cell size scale
force chains can in principle mediate mechanical interactions between distant
actomyosin units, leading to self-organized structural order in the cell
cytoskeleton. To investigate this process, we model the actin cytoskeleton on a
percolated fiber lattice network, where fibers are modeled as linear elastic
elements that can both bend and stretch, whereas myosin motors exert
contractile force dipoles. We quantify the range and heterogeneity of force
transmission in these networks in response to a force dipole, showing how these
depend on varying bond dilution and fiber bending-to-stretching stiffness
ratio. By analyzing clusters of nodes connected to highly strained bonds, as
well as the decay rate of strain energy with distance from the force dipole, we
show that long-range force transmission is screened out by fiber bending in
diluted networks. We further characterize the difference in the propagation of
tensile and compressive forces. This leads to a dependence of the mechanical
interaction between a pair of force dipoles on their mutual separation and
orientation. In more homogeneous networks, the interaction between force
dipoles recapitulates the power law dependence on separation distance predicted
by continuum elasticity theory, while in diluted networks, the interactions are
short-ranged and fluctuate strongly with local network configurations.
Altogether, our work suggests that elastic interactions between force dipoles
in disordered, fibrous media can act as an organizing principle in biological
materials.

the dialogue acts and rhetorical relations. It represents the functional,

A few key features distinguish DDA from existing dialogue annotation frameworks
such as SWBD-DAMSL and the ISO 24617-2 standard. First, DDA prioritizes the
relational structure of the dialogue units and the dialog context, annotating
both dialog acts and rhetorical relations as response relations to particular
utterances. Second, DDA embraces overloading in dialogues, encouraging
annotators to specify multiple response relations and dialog acts for each
dialog unit. Lastly, DDA places an emphasis on adequately capturing how a
speaker is using the full dialog context to plan and organize their speech.
With these features, DDA is highly expressive and recall-oriented with regard
to conversation dynamics between multiple speakers. In what follows, we present
the DDA annotation framework and case studies annotating DDA structures in
multi-party, multi-threaded conversations.

some features of collective decision making among higher organisms [A.T.
Hartnett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 (2016) 038701]. Within the model, the
state of an agent $i$ is described by the pair of variables corresponding to
its opinion $S_i=\pm 1$ and a bias $\omega_i$ towards any of the opposing
values of $S_i$. Collective decision making is interpreted as an approach to
the equilibrium state within the non-linear voter model subject to a social
pressure and a probabilistic algorithm. Here, we push such physical analogy
further and give the statistical physics interpretation of the model,
describing it in terms of the Hamiltonian of interaction and looking for the
equilibrium state via explicit calculation of its partition function. We show
that depending on the assumptions about the nature of social interactions two
different Hamiltonians can be formulated, which can be solved with different
methods. In such an interpretation the temperature serves as a measure of
fluctuations, not considered before in the original model. We find exact
solutions for the thermodynamics of the model on the complete graph. The
general analytical predictions are confirmed using individual-based
simulations. The simulations allow us also to study the impact of system size
and initial conditions in the collective decision making in finite-sized
systems, in particular with respect to convergence to metastable states.

open question. Here we evaluate the capability of a simplified network model

changing key design configurations (rather than just some parameters). We test

Further improvements to the sensitivity is expected in proposed nuclear clocks

delay reclamation for safety and reclaim objects in batches for efficiency. It

Small batch sizes and frequent reclamation attempts lead to high overhead,
while freeing large batches can lead to long program interruptions and high
memory footprints. An ideal SMR algorithm would forgo batching, and reclaim
memory immediately, without suffering high reclamation overheads. To this end,
we propose Conditional Access: a set of hardware instructions that offer
immediate reclamation and low overhead in optimistic data structures.
Conditional Access harnesses cache coherence to enable threads to efficiently
detect potential use-after-free errors without explicit shared memory
communication, and without introducing additional coherence traffic. We
implement and evaluate Conditional Access in Graphite, a multicore simulator.
Our experiments show that Conditional Access can rival the performance of

years. However, their performance highly relies on the architecture
hyperparameters, and finding proper hyperparameters for a deep CNN is a
challenging optimization problem owing to its high-dimensional and
computationally expensive characteristics. Given these difficulties, this study
proposes a surrogate-assisted highly cooperative hyperparameter optimization
(SHCHO) algorithm for chain-styled CNNs. To narrow the large search space,
SHCHO first decomposes the whole CNN into several overlapping sub-CNNs in
accordance with the overlapping hyperparameter interaction structure and then
cooperatively optimizes these hyperparameter subsets. Two cooperation
mechanisms are designed during this process. One coordinates all the sub-CNNs
to reproduce the information flow in the whole CNN and achieve macro
cooperation among them, and the other tackles the overlapping components by
simultaneously considering the involved two sub-CNNs and facilitates micro
cooperation between them. As a result, a proper hyperparameter configuration
can be effectively located for the whole CNN. Besides, SHCHO also employs the
well-performing surrogate technique to assist in the hyperparameter
optimization of each sub-CNN, thereby greatly reducing the expensive
computational cost. Extensive experimental results on two widely-used image
classification datasets indicate that SHCHO can significantly improve the
performance of CNNs.

abundances of CO, OH, and HCO$^+$ on various environmental parameters of the
interstellar medium in diffuse clouds and found that their abundances are
proportional to $\zeta_2$. Our analytic expressions give an excellent
calculation of the abundance of OH for $\zeta_2$ $\leq$10$^{-15}$ s$^{-1}$,
which are potentially useful for modelling chemistry in hydrodynamical
simulations. The abundances of OH and HCO$^+$ were found to monotonically
decrease with increasing density, while the CO abundance shows the opposite
trend. With high-sensitivity absorption transitions of both CO (1--0) and
(2--1) lines from ALMA, we have derived the H$_2$ number densities ($n_{\rm

challenge today with numerous connected devices continuously generating
petabytes of images, text, and internet of things (IoT) sensor data. One
approach to efficiently store the healthcare data is to extract the relevant
and representative features and store only those features instead of the
continuous streaming data. However, it raises a question as to the amount of
information content we can retain from the data and if we can reconstruct the
pseudo-original data when needed. By facilitating relevant and representative
feature extraction, storage and reconstruction of near original pattern, we aim
to address some of the challenges faced by the explosion of the streaming data.
We present a preliminary study, where we explored multiple autoencoders for
concise feature extraction and reconstruction for human activity recognition
(HAR) sensor data. Our Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) deep autoencoder achieved a
storage reduction of 90.18% compared to the three other implemented
autoencoders namely convolutional autoencoder, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
autoencoder, and convolutional LSTM autoencoder which achieved storage
reductions of 11.18%, 49.99%, and 72.35% respectively. Encoded features from
the autoencoders have smaller size and dimensions which help to reduce the
storage space. For higher dimensions of the representation, storage reduction

science and artificial intelligence. The key challenge is to effectively model
complex spatial-temporal dependencies and correlations in modern traffic data.
Existing methods, however, cannot accurately model both long-term and
short-term temporal correlations simultaneously, limiting their expressive
power on complex spatial-temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel
spatial-temporal neural network framework: Attention-based Spatial-Temporal
Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (ASTGCRN), which consists of a graph
convolutional recurrent module (GCRN) and a global attention module. In
particular, GCRN integrates gated recurrent units and adaptive graph
convolutional networks for dynamically learning graph structures and capturing
spatial dependencies and local temporal relationships. To effectively extract
global temporal dependencies, we design a temporal attention layer and
implement it as three independent modules based on multi-head self-attention,
transformer, and informer respectively. Extensive experiments on five real
traffic datasets have demonstrated the excellent predictive performance of all
our three models with all their average MAE, RMSE and MAPE across the test
datasets lower than the baseline methods.

data in domains with complex irregular boundaries due to its data distribution.
Traditional thin plate splines produce visually pleasing surfaces, but they are
too computationally expensive for data of large sizes. Finite element thin
plate spline smoother (TPSFEM) is an alternative that uses first-order finite
elements to efficiently interpolate and smooth large data sets. Previous
studies focused on regular square domains, which are insufficient for
real-world applications. This article builds on prior work and investigates the
performance of the TPSFEM and adaptive mesh refinement for real-world data sets
in irregular domains. The Dirichlet boundaries are approximated using the thin
plate spline and data-dependent weights are applied to prevent over-refinement
near boundaries. Three geological surveys (aerial, terrestrial and bathymetric)
with distinct data distribution patterns were tested in the numerical
experiments. We found that irregular domains with adaptive mesh refinement
significantly improve the efficiency of the interpolation. While the
inconsistency in approximated boundary conditions, we may prevent it using
additional constraints like weights. This finding is also applicable to other
finite element-based smoothers.

missing data or privacy concerns, which makes fair graph learning even more
challenging. In this paper, we propose FairAC, a fair attribute completion

instances, even trained personnel such as lifeguards have difficulty
identifying them. RipViz produces a simple, easy to understand visualization of
rip location overlaid on the source video. With RipViz, we first obtain an
unsteady 2D vector field from the stationary video using optical flow. Movement
at each pixel is analyzed over time. At each seed point, sequences of short
pathlines, rather a single long pathline, are traced across the frames of the
video to better capture the quasi-periodic flow behavior of wave activity.
Because of the motion on the beach, the surf zone, and the surrounding areas,
these pathlines may still appear very cluttered and incomprehensible.
Furthermore, lay audiences are not familiar with pathlines and may not know how
to interpret them. To address this, we treat rip currents as a flow anomaly in
an otherwise normal flow. To learn about the normal flow behavior, we train an
LSTM autoencoder with pathline sequences from normal ocean, foreground, and
background movements. During test time, we use the trained LSTM autoencoder to
detect anomalous pathlines (i.e., those in the rip zone). The origination
points of such anomalous pathlines, over the course of the video, are then
presented as points within the rip zone. RipViz is fully automated and does not
require user input. Feedback from domain expert suggests that RipViz has the
potential for wider use.

However, the physical origin and possible tunability of NLO responses in NbOX2

band-nesting-induced large intensity of electron-hole pairs. Remarkably, the
NbOCl2 can exhibit dramatically different strain-dependent BPVE under different

orbital transition. Importantly, we successfully achieve a reversible
ferroelectric-to-antiferroelectric phase transition via controlling ambient
temperature or external pressure, accompanied by the greatly tunable NLO
responses. Furthermore, we discover that the evolutions of SHG and BPVE in
NbOX2 with variable X obey different rules. Our study provides a deep

of compilers that supports compilation of heterogeneous programs. The key to
achieve VCC is to design a semantic interface that enables composition of
correctness theorems for compiling individual modules. Most of the existing
techniques for VCC fix a semantic interface from the very beginning and force
it down to every single compiler pass. This requires significant changes to the
existing framework and makes it difficult to understand the relationship
between conditions enforced by the semantic interface and the actual
requirements of compiler passes. A different approach is to design appropriate
semantic interfaces for individual compiler passes and combine them into a
unified interface which faithfully reflects the requirements of underlying
compiler passes. However, this requires vertically composable simulation
relations, which were traditionally considered very difficult to construct even
with extensive changes to compiler verification frameworks.
  We propose a solution to construction of unified semantic interfaces for VCC
with a bottom-up approach. Our starting point is CompCertO, an extension of
CompCert -- the state-of-the-art verified compiler -- that supports VCC but
lacks a unified interface. We discover that a CompCert Kripke Logical Relation
(CKLR) in CompCertO provides a uniform notion of memory protection for evolving
memory states across modules and is transitively composable. Based on this
uniform and composable CKLR, we then merge the simulation relations for all the
compiler pass in CompCertO (except for three value analysis passes) into a
unified interface. We demonstrate the conciseness and effectiveness of this
unified interface by applying it to verify the compositional compilation of a
non-trivial heterogeneous program with mutual recursion.

force fields (MLFFs) for bulk solid and liquid phases of d-block elements. In
exhaustive detail, we contrast the performance of force, energy, and stress
predictions across the transition metals for two leading MLFF models: a
kernel-based atomic cluster expansion method implemented using Gaussian
processes (FLARE), and an equivariant message-passing neural network (NequIP).
Early transition metals present higher relative errors and are more difficult
to learn relative to late platinum- and coinage-group elements, and this trend
persists across model architectures. The underlying physical and chemical
differences in the complexity of interatomic interactions for different metals
are revealed via comparison of the performance of representations with
different many-body order and angular resolution. This work illustrates
challenges in capturing intricate properties of metallic bonding with currently
leading MLFFs and provides a reference data set for transition metals, aimed at
benchmarking and development of emerging machine-learned approximations.

block cipher of the KATAN family, with an 80-bit key and 32-bit blocks. The
algorithm requires less computational power as it employs an 80 unsigned 64-bit
integer key for encrypting and decrypting data. During encryption, a data array
is passed into the encryption function with a key, which is then used to fill a
buffer with an encrypted array. Similarly, the decryption function utilizes a
buffer to fill an array of original data in 32 unsigned 64-bit integers. This
study also investigates the optimal implementation of cryptography block
ciphers, benchmarking performance against various metrics, including memory
requirements (RAM), throughput, power consumption, and security. Our

a set of labels (called label distribution (LD)) to an instance. The previous
LDL methods all assumed the LDs of the training instances are accurate.
However, annotating highly accurate LDs for training instances is
time-consuming and very expensive, and in reality the collected LD is usually
inaccurate and disturbed by annotating errors. For the first time, this paper
investigates the problem of inaccurate LDL, i.e., developing an LDL model with
noisy LDs. Specifically, we assume the noisy LD matrix is the linear
combination of an ideal LD matrix and a sparse noisy matrix. Accordingly,
inaccurate LDL becomes an inverse problem, i.e., recovering the ideal LD and
noise matrix from the inaccurate LDs. To this end, we assume the ideal LD
matrix is low-rank due to the correlation of labels. Besides, we use the local
geometric structure of instances captured by a graph to assist the ideal LD
recovery as if two instances are similar to each other, they are likely to
share the same LD. The proposed model is finally formulated as a
graph-regularized low-rank and sparse decomposition problem and numerically
solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can recover a relatively accurate LD
from the inaccurate LD and promote the performance of different LDL methods
with inaccurate LD.

state-of-the-art performance. However, previous methods either perform aimless
searching on the threshold scheduler or simply set the threshold trainable,
lacking theoretical explanation from a unified perspective. In this work, we
reformulate soft threshold pruning as an implicit optimization problem solved
using the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a classic method
from the fields of sparse recovery and compressed sensing. Under this
theoretical framework, all threshold tuning strategies proposed in previous
studies of soft threshold pruning are concluded as different styles of tuning
$L_1$-regularization term. We further derive an optimal threshold scheduler
through an in-depth study of threshold scheduling based on our framework. This
scheduler keeps $L_1$-regularization coefficient stable, implying a
time-invariant objective function from the perspective of optimization. In
principle, the derived pruning algorithm could sparsify any mathematical model
trained via SGD. We conduct extensive experiments and verify its
state-of-the-art performance on both Artificial Neural Networks (ResNet-50 and
MobileNet-V1) and Spiking Neural Networks (SEW ResNet-18) on ImageNet datasets.

accurate positioning in indoor spaces. A popular approach to positioning relies
on so-called radio maps that contain pairs of a vector of Wi-Fi signal strength
indicator values (RSSIs), called a fingerprint, and a location label, called a
reference point (RP), in which the fingerprint was observed. The positioning
accuracy depends on the quality of the radio maps and their fingerprints. Radio
maps are often sparse, with many pairs containing vectors missing many RSSIs as
well as RPs. Aiming to improve positioning accuracy, we present a complete set
of techniques to impute such missing values in radio maps. We differentiate two
types of missing RSSIs: missing not at random (MNAR) and missing at random
(MAR). Specifically, we design a framework encompassing a missing RSSI
differentiator followed by a data imputer for missing values. The
differentiator identifies MARs and MNARs via clustering-based fingerprint
analysis. Missing RSSIs and RPs are then imputed jointly by means of a novel
encoder-decoder architecture that leverages temporal dependencies in data
collection as well as correlations among fingerprints and RPs. A time-lag
mechanism is used to consider the aging of data, and a sparsity-friendly
attention mechanism is used to focus attention score calculation on observed
data. Extensive experiments with real data from two buildings show that our
proposal outperforms the alternatives with significant advantages in terms of
imputation accuracy and indoor positioning accuracy.

the next-highest affordance~(i.e. process-of-elimination strategy [1]), which
ignores the dependency between the self-assessment results and the remaining

failures might help trim the remaining over-estimated actions. In this paper,
we set to investigate this dependency by learning a failure-aware policy. We
propose two architectures for the failure-aware policy by representing the
self-assessment results of previous failures as the variable state, and
leveraging recurrent neural networks to implicitly memorize the previous
failures. Experiments conducted on three tasks demonstrate that our method can
achieve better performances with higher task success rates by less trials.
Moreover, when the actions are correlated, learning a failure-aware policy can
achieve better performance than the process-of-elimination strategy.

inevitably suffers from occlusions. A new paradigm, Cooperative Perception
(CP), comes to the rescue by sharing sensor data from another perspective,
i.e., from a cooperative vehicle (CoV). Due to the limited communication
bandwidth, it is essential to schedule the most beneficial CoV, considering
both the viewpoints and communication quality. Existing methods rely on the
exchange of meta-information, such as visibility maps, to predict the
perception gains from nearby vehicles, which induces extra communication and
processing overhead. In this paper, we propose a new approach, learning while
scheduling, for distributed scheduling of CP. The solution enables CoVs to
predict the perception gains using past observations, leveraging the temporal
continuity of perception gains. Specifically, we design a mobility-aware sensor
scheduling (MASS) algorithm based on the restless multi-armed bandit (RMAB)
theory to maximize the expected average perception gain. An upper bound on the
expected average learning regret is proved, which matches the lower bound of
any online algorithm up to a logarithmic factor. Extensive simulations are
carried out on realistic traffic traces. The results show that the proposed
MASS algorithm achieves the best average perception gain and improves recall by
up to 4.2 percentage points compared to other learning-based algorithms.
Finally, a case study on a trace of LiDAR frames qualitatively demonstrates the
superiority of adaptive exploration, the key element of the MASS algorithm.

Greece. Then, we train ensemble machine learning models, like XGBoost, on

influences prices through interpretability evaluation techniques. Our study
provides a new noise pollution dataset that not only demonstrates the impact
noise has on housing prices, but also indicates that the influence of noise on
prices significantly varies among different areas of the same city.

adapt their direction of motion from the other active particles, is introduced.
The orientation adapters exist besides the usual Vicsek-like particles; both
are self-driven, however, follow different interaction rules. We have studied
the dynamics in high speed of the particles keeping dissimilar speeds for these
different species. The effect of orientation adapters on the collective
behaviour of the system is explored in this model. The orientational
order-disorder phase transition is mainly studied in such systems. First, for
equal density of both species, when the adapter speed $v_a=1.2v_0$ and usual
particles speed $v_0=1.0$, both adapters and the usual particles form dense
travelling bands and move in the same direction. Near the transition point,
such bands appear and disappear over time, giving rise to the co-existence of
two phases. The adapters and the usual particles both undergo a discontinuous
transition. The nature of the transition is further confirmed by the existence
of hysteresis in the order parameter under a continuously varying noise field.
However, when the adapter velocity becomes much higher than the usual SPPs $v_a
\approx 7v_0$, the formation of travelling bands disappears from the system,
and the transition becomes continuous. The density ratio is also varied,
keeping the velocities constant, and the phase transition is studied. For a
high adapter velocity with $v_a=10v_0$, the continuous transition is found with
low-density values of the adapters. The critical exponents related to the
continuous transition are also determined.

Connectivity Test. We consider a graph whose edges have two possible states
(on/off). The edges' states are hidden initially. We could query an edge to
reveal its state. Given a source s and a destination t, we aim to test s-t
connectivity by identifying either a path (consisting of only on edges) or a
cut (consisting of only off edges). We are limited to B queries, after which we
stop regardless of whether graph connectivity is established. We aim to design
a query policy that minimizes the expected number of queries.
  If we remove the query limit B (i.e., by setting B to the total number of
edges), then our problem becomes a special case of (monotone) Stochastic
Boolean Function Evaluation (SBFE). There are two existing exact algorithms
that are prohibitively expensive. They have best known upper bounds of O(3^m)
and O(2^{2^k}) respectively, where m is the number of edges and k is the number
of paths/cuts. These algorithms do not scale well in practice.
  We propose a significantly more scalable exact algorithm. Our exact algorithm
works by iteratively improving the performance lower bound until the lower
bound becomes achievable. Even when our exact algorithm does not scale, it can
be used as an anytime algorithm for calculating lower bound.
  We experiment on a wide range of practical graphs. We observe that even for
large graphs (i.e., tens of thousands of edges), it mostly takes only a few
queries to reach conclusion, which is the practical motivation behind the query
limit B. B is also an algorithm parameter that controls scalability. For small
B, our exact algorithm scales well. For large B, our exact algorithm can be
converted to a heuristic (i.e., always pretend that there are only 5 queries
left). Our heuristic outperforms all existing heuristics ported from SBFE and
related literature.

designing a compensator of arbitrary order to make the system comply with given

geometrically interpreted in the frequency domain. The approach is developed
and a proof of its ability to converge, if a solution exists, to the

these inference algorithms rely on execution suspension to perform inference,
most often enabled through a full continuation-passing style (CPS)
transformation. However, standard CPS transformations for PPL compilers
introduce significant overhead, a problem the community has generally
overlooked. State-of-the-art solutions either perform complete CPS
transformations with performance penalties due to unnecessary closure
allocations or use efficient, but complex, low-level solutions that are often
not available in high-level languages. In contrast to prior work, we develop a
new approach that is both efficient and easy to implement using higher-order
languages. Specifically, we design a novel static suspension analysis technique
that determines the parts of a program that require suspension, given a
particular inference algorithm. The analysis result allows selectively CPS
transforming the program only where necessary. We formally prove the
correctness of the suspension analysis and implement both the suspension
analysis and selective CPS transformation in the Miking CorePPL compiler. We
evaluate the implementation for a large number of Monte Carlo inference
algorithms on real-world models from phylogenetics, epidemiology, and topic

and examine its aftereffects. In this direction, this paper examines the
effects of cybersickness on cognitive, motor, and reading performance in VR.
Also, this paper evaluates the mitigating effects of music on cybersickness, as
well as the role of gender, and the computing, VR, and gaming experience of the
user. This paper reports two studies. In this study, 39 participants performed
an assessment four times, once before the rides (baseline), and then once after
each ride (3 rides). In each ride either Calming, or Joyful, or No Music was
played. During each ride, linear and angular accelerations took place to induce
cybersickness in the participants. In each assessment, while immersed in VR,
the participants evaluated their cybersickness symptomatology and performed a
verbal working memory task, a visuospatial working memory task, and a
psychomotor task. While responding to the cybersickness questionnaire (3D UI),
eye-tracking was conducted to measure reading time and pupillometry. The
results showed that Joyful and Calming music substantially decreased the
intensity of nausea-related symptoms. However, only Joyful music significantly
decreased the overall cybersickness intensity. Importantly, cybersickness was
found to decrease verbal working memory performance and pupil size. Also, it
significantly decelerated psychomotor (reaction time) and reading abilities.
Higher gaming experience was associated with lower cybersickness. When
controlling for gaming experience, there were no significant differences
between female and male participants in terms of cybersickness. The outcomes
indicated the efficiency of music in mitigating cybersickness, the important
role of gaming experience in cybersickness, and the significant effects of
cybersickness on pupil size, cognition, psychomotor skills, and reading
ability.

Neural Networks (DNNs) are trained on datasets added to hidden trigger
patterns. Although the poisoned model behaves normally on benign samples, it
produces anomalous results on samples containing the trigger pattern.
Nevertheless, most existing backdoor attacks face two significant drawbacks:
their trigger patterns are visible and easy to detect by human inspection, and
their injection process leads to the loss of natural sample features and
trigger patterns, thereby reducing the attack success rate and the model
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor attack named SATBA that
overcomes these limitations by using spatial attention mechanism and U-type
model. Our attack leverages spatial attention mechanism to extract data
features and generate invisible trigger patterns that are correlated with clean
data. Then it uses U-type model to plant these trigger patterns into the
original data without causing noticeable feature loss. We evaluate our attack
on three prominent image classification DNNs across three standard datasets and
demonstrate that it achieves high attack success rate and robustness against
backdoor defenses. Additionally, we also conduct extensive experiments on image
similarity to highlight the stealthiness of our attack.

To address this issue, we propose an AI-powered medical imaging retrieval
framework called DeepBrainPrint, which is designed to retrieve brain MRI scans
of the same patient. Our framework is a semi-self-supervised contrastive deep
learning approach with three main innovations. First, we use a combination of
self-supervised and supervised paradigms to create an effective brain
fingerprint from MRI scans that can be used for real-time image retrieval.
Second, we use a special weighting function to guide the training and improve
model convergence. Third, we introduce new imaging transformations to improve
retrieval robustness in the presence of intensity variations (i.e. different
scan contrasts), and to account for age and disease progression in patients. We
tested DeepBrainPrint on a large dataset of T1-weighted brain MRIs from the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and on a synthetic dataset
designed to evaluate retrieval performance with different image modalities. Our
results show that DeepBrainPrint outperforms previous methods, including simple
similarity metrics and more advanced contrastive deep learning frameworks.

in neutron star mergers. In AT2017gfo, the kilonova associated with GW170817,
the spectroscopic feature centered around 8000 angstroms has been interpreted
as the P-Cygni profile arising from singly ionized Strontium. Recently, Perego
et al. (2022) suggested that Helium 10833 line can be an alternative
explanation of the feature. Here, we study the line features under non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium. We find that the ionization of ejecta by the
stopping of radioactive decay product can significantly enhance the ionization
states around the line forming region. We compute the kilonova spectrum under
the assumption of spherical symmetry and uniform elemental fraction in the
line-forming region. We find that 0.2\% (in mass) of Helium in the ejecta can
reproduce the P-Cygni feature in the observed spectrum at $1.43$ -- $4.40$
days. Strontium with a mass fraction of $1\%$ is also able to make the
absorption feature at $\sim 1.5\,$days, but it gets weaker with time due to
ionization by radioactive decay products. The strength of the He line signature
depends sensitively on UV strength for the first two epochs. Further modeling
of UV line blanketing by $r$-process elements and the optical properties of
light $r$-process elements would be crucial to distinguish between Helium and
Strontium features. The mass fraction of He is a good indicator for ejecta
entropy that allows us to probe the mass ejection mechanism.

impractical. Moreover, existing schemes may result in some security problems,
such as the collusion attack due to the presence of a trusted third party, and
malicious data tampering caused by the system operator (SO) being attacked.
Aiming at the problems above, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving
electricity theft detection scheme without a third party. Specifically, the
proposed scheme uses an improved functional encryption scheme to enable
electricity theft detection and load monitoring while preserving consumers'
privacy; distributed storage of consumers' data with blockchain to resolve
security problems such as data tampering, etc. Meanwhile, we build a long
short-term memory network (LSTM) model to perform higher accuracy for
electricity theft detection. The proposed scheme is evaluated in a real
environment, and the results show that it is more accurate in electricity theft
detection within acceptable communication and computational overhead. Our
system analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme can resist various

therefore include strategies that reduce uncertainty and hence improve the

The switching is taking place between a low resistive mainly metallic-type
state and a high resistive semiconducting-type state by applying bias voltage
(usually below 0.5V), while reverse switching takes place by applying voltage
of opposite polarity (usually below 0.5V). The difference in resistance between
these two states can reach up to two orders of magnitude at the room
temperature. The origin of the effect can be attributed to the variation of
stoichiometry in PC core due to drift/displacement of Se/Ti vacancies under
high electric field. Additionally, we demonstrated, that heating takes place in
PC core, which can facilitate the electric field induced effect. At the same
time, we did not found any evidence for CDW spectral features in our PC spectra

maximum Poisson likelihood, maximum a posteriori). If it is desired for the
reconstruction networks to generalise (i.e. to need either no or minimal
retraining for a new measured dataset, but to be fast, ready to reuse), then
these self-supervised networks show potential even when previously trained from

computation. Compared to the popular Temporal Difference (TD) learning, which
can be viewed as taking a single gradient descent step to FQI's subproblem per

guarantee a suboptimal $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample

in [DNS22]. Here, we prove the uniqueness of physical solutions for oscillatory
initial conditions by a new contraction argument that allows to replace the
local monotonicity condition of [DNS22] with an averaging condition. We verify
this weaker condition for fairly general oscillating probability densities,
such as the ones given by an almost sure trajectory of
$(1+W_x-\sqrt{2x|\log{|\log{x}|}|})_{+}\wedge 1$ near the origin, where $W$ is
a standard Brownian motion. We also permit typical deterministically
constructed oscillating densities, including those of the form
$(1+\sin{1/x})/2$ near the origin. Finally, we provide an example of
oscillating densities for which it is possible to go beyond our main assumption

However, few works explore the tool-chains behind adversarial examples, which
can help defenders to seize the clues about the originator of the attack, their
goals, and provide insight into the most effective defense algorithm against
corresponding attacks. With such a gap, it is necessary to develop techniques
that can recognize tool-chains that are leveraged to generate the adversarial
examples, which is called Adversarial Attribution Problem (AAP). In this paper,
AAP is defined as the recognition of three signatures, i.e., {\em attack
algorithm}, {\em victim model} and {\em hyperparameter}. Current works transfer
AAP into single label classification task and ignore the relationship between
these signatures. The former will meet combination explosion problem as the
number of signatures is increasing. The latter dictates that we cannot treat
AAP simply as a single task problem. We first conduct some experiments to

in a context specific way. We show here that when systems are described as
executing active inference driven by the free-energy principle (and hence can
be considered Bayesian prediction-error minimizers), their control flow systems
can always be represented as tensor networks (TNs). We show how TNs as control
systems can be implmented within the general framework of quantum topological
neural networks, and discuss the implications of these results for modeling
biological systems at multiple scales.

  determination directly from cryo-EM micrographs",,,,,"eess.IV eess.SP q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) measurement, called a
micrograph, consists of multiple two-dimensional tomographic projections of a
three-dimensional molecular structure at unknown locations, taken under unknown
viewing directions. All existing cryo-EM algorithmic pipelines first locate and
extract the projection images, and then reconstruct the structure from the
extracted images. However, if the molecular structure is small, the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the data is very low, and thus accurate
detection of projection images within the micrograph is challenging.
Consequently, all standard techniques fail in low-SNR regimes. To recover
molecular structures from measurements of low SNR, and in particular small
molecular structures, we devise a stochastic approximate
expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the three-dimensional structure
directly from the micrograph, bypassing locating the projection images. We
corroborate our computational scheme with numerical experiments, and present
successful structure recoveries from simulated noisy measurements.

of events has a local focus that primarily affects specific language

Coronavirus pandemic in different countries, and local film festivals such as
the C\'esar Awards in France and the Moscow International Film Festival in
Russia. However, existing entity recommendation approaches do not sufficiently
address the language context of recommendation. This article introduces the
novel task of language-specific event recommendation, which aims to recommend
events relevant to the user query in the language-specific context. This task
can support essential information retrieval activities, including web
navigation and exploratory search, considering the language context of user
information needs. We propose LaSER, a novel approach toward language-specific
event recommendation. LaSER blends the language-specific latent representations
(embeddings) of entities and events and spatio-temporal event features in a
learning to rank model. This model is trained on publicly available Wikipedia
Clickstream data. The results of our user study demonstrate that LaSER
outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation baselines by up to 33 percentage
points in MAP@5 concerning the language-specific relevance of recommended
events.

households and firms competing in a labor market. Each household earns income
and engages in consumption at each time step while aiming to maximize a concave
utility subject to the underlying market conditions. The households aim to find
the optimal saving strategy that maximizes their discounted cumulative utility
given the market condition, while the firms determine the market conditions
through maximizing corporate profit based on the household population behavior.
The model captures a wide range of applications in macroeconomic studies, and
we propose a data-driven reinforcement learning framework that finds the
regularized competitive equilibrium of the model. The proposed algorithm enjoys
theoretical guarantees in converging to the equilibrium of the market at a
sub-linear rate.

often suffer from the problem of optimizing the corresponding tuning
parameters. To improve the performance for the problem of interest, the
specific parameter tuning is required, which in practice can be a
time-consuming and tedious task. The present paper deals with the problem of
automating the optimization of the numerical method parameters to improve the
performance of the mathematical physics simulations and simplify the modeling
process.
  The paper proposes the hybrid evolution strategy applied to tune the
parameters of the Krylov subspace and algebraic multigrid iterative methods
when solving a sequence of linear systems with a constant matrix and varying
right-hand side. The algorithm combines the evolution strategy with the
pre-trained neural network, which filters the individuals in the new
generation. The coupling of two optimization approaches allows to integrate the
adaptivity properties of the evolution strategy with a priori knowledge
realized by the neural network. The use of the neural network as a preliminary
filter allows for significant weakening of the prediction accuracy requirements
and reusing the pre-trained network with a wide range of linear systems.
  The algorithm efficiency evaluation is performed for a set of model linear
systems, including the ones from the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection and the
systems from the turbulent flow simulations. The obtained results show that the
pre-trained neural network can be reused to optimize parameters for various
linear systems, and a significant speedup in the calculations can be achieved
at the cost of about 100 trial solves. The algorithm decreases the calculation
time by more than 6 times for the black box matrices from the SuiteSparse
Matrix Collection and by a factor of 1.5-1.8 for the turbulent flow simulations
considered in the paper.

reference window in terms of statistical properties. Specifically, we partition
these data into statistically homogeneous subsets by identifying possible
clutter power variations with respect to the cells under test (accounting for
possible range-spread targets) and/or clutter edges. To this end, we consider
different situations of practical interest and formulate the classification
problem as multiple hypothesis tests comprising several models for the
operating scenario. Then, we solve the hypothesis testing problems by resorting
to suitable approximations of the model order selection rules due to the
intractable mathematics associated with the maximum likelihood estimation of
some parameters. Remarkably, the classification results provided by the
proposed architectures represent an advanced clutter map since, besides the
estimation of the clutter parameters, they contain a clustering of the range
bins in terms of homogeneous subsets. In fact, such information can drive the
conventional detectors towards more reliable estimates of the clutter
covariance matrix according to the position of the cells under test. The
performance analysis confirms that the conceived architectures represent a
viable means to recognize the scenario wherein the radar is operating at least
for the considered simulation parameters.

$R_\odot$, is formed by a slow and dense wind stream running along the coronal
current sheet, accelerating in the radial direction and reaching at 6.8
$R_\odot$ a speed within 150 km s$^{-1}$ and 190 km s$^{-1}$, depending on the
assumptions on the velocity distribution of the neutral hydrogen atoms in the
coronal plasma. The slow stream is separated by thin regions of high velocity
shear from faster streams, almost symmetric relative to the current sheet, with
peak velocity within 175 km s$^{-1}$ and 230 km s$^{-1}$ at the same coronal
level. The density-velocity structure of the slow wind zone is discussed in
terms of the expansion factor of the open magnetic field lines that is known to
be related to the speed of the quasi-steady solar wind, and in relation to the
presence of a web of quasi separatrix layers, S-web, the potential sites of
reconnection that release coronal plasma into the wind. The parameters
characterizing the coronal magnetic field lines are derived from 3D MHD model
calculations. The S-web is found to coincide with the latitudinal region where
the slow wind is observed in the outer corona and is surrounded by thin layers
of open field lines expanding in a non-monotonic way.

to linearize the dependence of the response on pulse strength. The result is
called the {\em infinitesimal} phase response function. These ideas have been

that the work probability distribution is invariant under this transformation,
allowing one to compute the full counting statistics of work at strong

concentrated X-ray surface brightness, dark matter, and galaxy distributions
with respect to the X-ray detected halos. Consistently with the low mass
concentration, the magnitude gap indicates that these are younger systems. The
later assembly time is confirmed by the bluer average color of the BCG and of
the galaxy population with respect to the detected systems. They reside with a
higher probability in filaments while X-ray detected low-mass halos favor the
nodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the suppressed X-ray central emission, the
undetected systems tend to be X-ray under-luminous at fixed halo mass, and to
lie below the $L_X-M_{halo}$ relation. Interestingly, the X-ray detected
systems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while those
in filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relation
between the properties of detected and undetected systems with the AGN
activity. The fraction of optically selected AGN in the galaxy population is
consistent in the two samples. More interestingly, the probability that the BCG
hosts a radio AGN is lower in the undetected groups. We, thus, argue that the
observed differences between X-ray detected and undetected groups are
ascribable to the Cosmic Web, and its role in the halo assembly bias. Our
results suggest that the X-ray selection is biased to favor the most
concentrated and old systems located in the nodes of the Cosmic Web.

development in regions of biomedicine and medical diagnostics. Improving the
sensitivity of NV center sensor under wide inhomogeneous broadening and filed
amplitude drift is one crucial issue of continuous concern, which relies on the
coherent control of NV center with higher average fidelity. Quantum optimal
control (QOC) methods provide access to this target, nevertheless the high time
consumption of current methods due to the large number of needful sample points
as well as the complexity of the parameter space has hindered their usability.
In this paper we propose the Bayesian estimation phase-modulated (B-PM) method

ensemble, the B-PM method reduces the time consumption by more than $90\%$

increasing the average fidelity from $0.894$ to $0.905$. In AC magnetometry
scenery, the optimized control pulse given by B-PM method achieves a eight-fold
extension of the coherence time $T_2$ compared to rectangular $\pi$ pulse.
Similar application can be made in other sensing situations. As a general

lead to an exact characterization of the worst-case expected regret of these
policies. This exact characterization applies to any sample size and any
observed contexts. The model we develop is flexible, and captures the case of
partially observed contexts. This exact analysis enables to unveil new
structural insights on the learning behavior of uniform kernel methods: i) the
specialized analysis leads to very large improvements in quantification of
performance compared to state of the art general purpose bounds. ii) we show an
important non-monotonicity of the performance as a function of data size not
captured by previous bounds; and iii) we show that in some regimes, a little
increase in the quality of the data can dramatically reduce the amount of
samples required to reach a performance target. All in all, our work
demonstrates that it is possible to quantify in a precise fashion the interplay
of data quality and quantity, and performance in a central problem class. It
also highlights the need for problem specific bounds in order to understand the
trade-offs at play.

each link is described by a universal component that can be instantiated as
basic components (e.g., resistors, capacitors) or combinations of basic
components via discrete switches. To address the combinatorial explosion often
present in mixed-integer optimization problems, we present two algorithms. In
the first algorithm, we convert the discrete switches into continuous switches
that are physically realizable and formulate a parameter optimization problem
that learns the component and switch parameters while inducing design sparsity
through an $L_1$ regularization term. The second algorithm uses a genetic-like
approach with selection and mutation steps guided by ranking of requirements
costs, combined with continuous optimization for generating optimal parameters.
We improve the time complexity of the optimization problem in both algorithms
by reconstructing the model when components become redundant and by simplifying
topologies through collapsing components and removing disconnected ones. To
demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms, we apply them to the design of
various electrical circuits.

stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), that is expected to open a
window on the very early Universe (cosmological background) and to provide us
new information on astrophysical source populations (astrophysical background).
One way to characterize the SGWB and to extract information about its origin is
through the cross-correlation with other cosmological probes. To this aim, in
this paper, we explore the cross-correlation between the astrophysical
background anisotropies and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) ones. Such a
signal is sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity (nG) through the GW bias.
Thus, we study the capability of next generation space-based interferometers to

become very popular. To interpret these models, local feature attributions
based on marginal expectations e.g. marginal (interventional) Shapley, Owen or
Banzhaf values may be employed. Such feature attribution methods are true to
the model and implementation invariant, i.e. dependent only on the input-output
function of the model. By taking advantage of the internal structure of
tree-based models, we prove that their marginal Shapley values, or more
generally marginal feature attributions obtained from a linear game value, are
simple (piecewise-constant) functions with respect to a certain finite
partition of the input space determined by the trained model. The same is true
for feature attributions obtained from the famous TreeSHAP algorithm.
Nevertheless, we show that the ""path-dependent"" TreeSHAP is not implementation
invariant by presenting two (statistically similar) decision trees computing
the exact same function for which the algorithm yields different rankings of
features, whereas the marginal Shapley values coincide. Furthermore, we discuss
how the fact that marginal feature attributions are simple functions can
potentially be utilized to compute them. An important observation, showcased by
experiments with XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost libraries, is that only a
portion of all features appears in a tree from the ensemble; thus the
complexity of computing marginal Shapley (or Owen or Banzhaf) feature
attributions may be reduced. In particular, in the case of CatBoost models, the
trees are oblivious (symmetric) and the number of features in each of them is
no larger than the depth. We exploit the symmetry to derive an explicit formula
with improved complexity for marginal Shapley (and Banzhaf and Owen) values
which is only in terms of the internal parameters of the CatBoost model.

individual nodal dynamics, and we refer to it as the coherent dynamics. Our

model representations from networked data and allow for decentralized
implementation through localized communications. Existing GNN architectures
often assume ideal communication links and ignore channel effects, such as
fading and noise, leading to performance degradation in real-world
implementation. This paper proposes graph neural networks over the air
(AirGNNs), a novel GNN architecture that incorporates the communication model
into the architecture. AirGNN modifies the graph convolutional operation that
shifts graph signals over random communication graphs to take into account
channel fading and noise when aggregating features from neighbors, thus,
improving the architecture robustness to channel impairments during testing. We
propose a stochastic gradient descent based method to train the AirGNN, and
show that the training procedure converges to a stationary solution. Numerical
simulations on decentralized source localization and multi-robot flocking
corroborate theoretical findings and show superior performance of the AirGNN
over wireless communication channels.

worldwide environmental concern. It is a lesser-known fact that several
emerging contaminants, such as bisphenol and perfluoro alkylates adsorbing on
micro and nanoplastics, could invade the food chain and cause irreversible
damage to human health and the environment. Even though wastewater treatment
plants (WWTPs) have been around for a long time, their removal strategy needs
to be improved since this is one of the main routes that micro and nanoplastics
get into the environment. UV deterioration, mechanical stresses, and biological
processes cause plastics to break apart and turn into smaller pieces. They get
small enough to be called nanoplastics, i.e. 1 um. We studied the removal of
nanoplastics from synthetic wastewater using an electrocoagulation process. We
used the polystyrene nanoparticles as nanoplastics synthesized from the
expanded polystyrene waste (EPS). For studies on electrocoagulation (EC),
aluminium electrodes were used in parallel combination at low voltage
conditions. We take advantage of the release of gas bubbles from the process to
enable the removal from the top by scraping them off. We studied the influence
of various process parameters on removing nanoplastics, such as electrode
spacing, salt concentration, and applied voltage. We found that a maximum
removal efficiency of more than 95% could be achieved at a specific electrolyte
concentration and pH of 7.2 +/- 0.3, illustrating that EC is a successful
technique for removing nanoplastic pollutants from the aquatic environment. The
advantage of the proposed method is that when nanoplastics and coagulants are
mixed, they help make a foamy layer on top of the reactor that can be easily
scraped off. The results of this study could serve as baseline information for
achieving massive nanoplastics cleanup on a larger scale in an eco-friendly
way.

of the position along their length. Their temperatures at the detected
footpoints are, on average, 300 K higher than the temperature at the midpoint.
The temperature variation appears to be almost symmetrical in shape, with
partially traced fibrils showing a similar trend for the temperature variation.
Additionally, the response of the Ca ii 854.2 nm line core to variations of the

be insufficient to properly resolve the aforementioned temperature structure.

maximum amount of time the motion planner can spend planning a motion (i.e.,
time budget). Many previous works assign fixed values to these parameters

inventory management and dynamic pricing models that have continuous state
spaces, and students may not be aware of the possible challenges involved in
studying dynamic programming models with general state spaces. To address this,
we provide conditions and a self-contained simple proof that establish when the
principle of optimality for discounted dynamic programming is valid. These
conditions shed light on the difficulties that may arise in the general state
space case. We provide examples from the literature that include the relatively
involved case of universally measurable dynamic programming and the simple case
of finite dynamic programming where our main result can be applied to show that
the principle of optimality holds.

significant progress in language-to-code generation. State-of-the-art
approaches in this area combine CodeLM decoding with sample pruning and
reranking using test cases or heuristics based on the execution results.
However, it is challenging to obtain test cases for many real-world
language-to-code applications, and heuristics cannot well capture the semantic
features of the execution results, such as data type and value range, which
often indicates the correctness of the program. In this work, we propose LEVER,
a simple approach to improve language-to-code generation by learning to verify
the generated programs with their execution results. Specifically, we train
verifiers to determine whether a program sampled from the CodeLM is correct or
not based on the natural language input, the program itself and its execution
results. The sampled programs are reranked by combining the verification score
with the CodeLM generation probability, and marginalizing over programs with
the same execution results. On four datasets across the domains of table QA,
math QA and basic Python programming, LEVER consistently improves over the base
CodeLMs (4.6% to 10.9% with code-davinci-002) and achieves new state-of-the-art

Here, we use hardware-aware (HWA) training to systematically examine the
accuracy of AIMC for multiple common artificial intelligence (AI) workloads
across multiple DNN topologies, and investigate sensitivity and robustness to a
broad set of nonidealities. By introducing a new and highly realistic AIMC
crossbar-model, we improve significantly on earlier retraining approaches. We
show that many large-scale DNNs of various topologies, including convolutional

in fact be successfully retrained to show iso-accuracy on AIMC. Our results
further suggest that AIMC nonidealities that add noise to the inputs or

RNNs are particularly robust to all nonidealities.

unprecedented tests of gravitational theories beyond Einstein's General
Relativity (GR) in highly nonlinear, dynamical regimes. Such GW measurements
require an accurate description of GW signatures that may arise in alternative
gravitational models. In this work, we focus on a class of higher-curvature
extensions of GR, the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, where BHs can develop
scalar hair. In an inspiraling binary system, this leads to scalar-induced
tidal effects in the dynamics and radiation. We calculate the dominant
adiabatic dipolar tidal effects via an approximation scheme based on expansions
in post-Newtonian, higher-curvature, and tidal corrections. The tidal effects
depend on a characteristic scalar Love number, which we compute using BH
perturbation theory, and have the same scaling with GW frequency as the
higher-curvature corrections. We perform case studies to characterize the net
size and parameter dependencies of these effects, showing that at low
frequencies, tidal effects dominate over the higher-curvature contributions for
small couplings within current bounds, regardless of the total BH mass, while
at high frequencies they are subdominant. We further consider prospects
observing both of these regimes, which would be interesting for breaking
parameter degeneracies, with multiband detections of LISA and ground-based
detectors or the Einstein Telescope alone. We also assess the frequency range
of the transition between these regimes by numerically solving the energy
balance law. Our results highlight the importance of the dipolar scalar tidal
effects for BHs with scalar hair, which arise in several beyond-GR paradigms,

to the shear-induced angular velocity they acquire within the channel flow

a novel tensorial reduced order model (TROM). The reduced model is
projection-based and for systems with no parameters involved it resembles the
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) combined with the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM). For parametric systems, the TROM employs low-rank
tensor approximations in place of truncated SVD, a key dimension-reduction
technique in POD with DEIM. Three popular low-rank tensor compression formats
are considered for this purpose: canonical polyadic, Tucker, and tensor train.
The use of multi-linear algebra tools allows to incorporate the information
about the parameter dependence of the system into the reduced model and leads
to a POD--DEIM type ROM which (i) is parameter-specific (localized) and
predicts the system dynamics for out-of-training set (unseen) parameter values,
(ii) mitigates the adverse effects of high parameter space dimension, (iii) has
online computational costs that depend only on tensor compression ranks but not
on the full order model size, and (iv) achieves lower reduced space dimensions
compared to the conventional POD--DEIM ROM. The paper explains the method,
analyzes its prediction power, and assesses its performance for two specific

promising approach for studying quantum dynamics. The basic idea involves
exchanging the roles of space and time and evolving the system using a space
transfer matrix. The infinite-volume limit is then described by the fixed
points of this operator, also known as influence matrices. To evaluate the
potential of this method as a numerical scheme, it is important to understand
whether the influence matrices can be efficiently encoded in a classical
computer. It is then natural to wonder what is the scaling of their
entanglement, dubbed temporal entanglement, as a function of time. In this work
we study space evolution in chaotic quantum circuits. First, we extend the
concept of space-evolution to include evolution in any generic space-like
direction, which enables us to use influence matrices on a generic time-like
surface, or path, to describe any two-point function. Then we study their
entanglement, finding that it scales linearly with time for all paths but with
two interesting marginal cases: (i) vertical paths in generic chaotic systems
(ii) any path in dual-unitary circuits. In these cases R\'enyi entropies with
index larger than one are sub-linear in time, while the von Neumann
entanglement entropy is linear but grows at a slower rate compared to regular
state entanglement. We attribute this behaviour to the existence of a product
state with large overlap with the influence matrices, similarly to what has
been observed for regular entanglement in systems with conservation laws.

we propose an {\it effective} and fully analytic model for the 21-cm signal

local star-formation rate density (SFRD) against densities at early times to
analytically find its correlation functions including nonlinearities. The SFRD
acts as the building block to obtain the statistics of radiative fields (X-ray
and Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes), and therefore the 21-cm signal. We implement this
model as the public Python package Zeus21. This code can fully predict the

requirements. When comparing against state-of-the-art semi-numerical
simulations from 21CMFAST we find agreement to $\sim10\%$ precision in both the

modular, allowing the user to vary the astrophysical model for the first

and HK-LBL can measure both the solar and atmospheric mass splittings in their
long-baseline analyses alone. While their sensitivities are not competitive
with existing constraints, they are very orthogonal probes of solar parameters
and provide a key consistency check of a less probed sector of the three-flavor
oscillation picture. Furthermore, we also show that the true values of the
solar parameters play an important role in the sensitivity of other oscillation
parameters such as the CP violating phase $\delta$.

mass mechanisms from tree- and one-loop-level contributions. We demonstrate
that the ingredients needed to explain this hierarchy are present in the
minimal discrete dark matter model [arXiv:2301.10811]. This scenario is
characterized by adding new RH neutrinos and scalar $SU(2)$ doublets to the
Standard Model as triplet representations of an $A_4$ flavour symmetry. The
$A_4$ symmetry breaking, which occurs at the electroweak scale, leads to a

clustering and lensing of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
galaxies in the $\textit{Planck}$ cosmology. We construct a simple yet powerful
model based on the linear theory to assess whether this discrepancy points
toward deviations from $\textit{Planck}$. Focusing on scales $10<R<30$
$h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, we model the amplitudes of clustering and lensing of BOSS
LOWZ galaxies using three parameters: galaxy bias $b_\mathrm{g}$, galaxy-matter
cross-correlation coefficient $r_\mathrm{gm}$, and $A$, defined as the ratio
between the true and $\textit{Planck}$ values of $\sigma_8$. Using the
cross-correlation matrix as a diagnostic, we detect systematic uncertainties
that drive spurious correlations among the low-mass galaxies. After building a
clean LOWZ sample with $r_\mathrm{gm}\sim1$, we derive a joint constraint of
$b_\mathrm{g}$ and $A$ from clustering+lensing, yielding
$b_\mathrm{g}=2.47_{-0.30}^{+0.36}$ and $A=0.81_{-0.09}^{+0.10}$, i.e., a
$2\sigma$ tension with $\textit{Planck}$. However, due to the strong degeneracy
between $b_\mathrm{g}$ and $A$, systematic uncertainties in $b_\mathrm{g}$
could masquerade as a tension with $A=1$. To ascertain this possibility, we
develop a new method to measure $b_\mathrm{g}$ from the cluster-galaxy
cross-correlation and cluster weak lensing using an overlapping cluster sample.
By applying the independent bias measurement ($b_\mathrm{g}=1.76\pm0.22$) as a
prior, we successfully break the degeneracy and derive stringent constraints of
$b_\mathrm{g}=2.02_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$ and $A=0.96\pm0.07$. Therefore, our result
suggests that the large-scale clustering and lensing of LOWZ galaxies are
consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, while the different bias estimates may be
related to some observational systematics in the target selection.

of a NSC caught in its earlier stages. First, we report on remnants of a past
interaction in the form of diffuse streams or shells, suggesting a recent
merging of two dwarf galaxies with a 1:5 stellar mass ratio. Second, we
identify a number of globular cluster (GC) candidates that are broadly
compatible in colour with the main component that is both more extended and
more massive. Strikingly, we find these GCs candidates to be highly
concentrated towards the centre of the galaxy (R$_{GC}$ = 0.41 R$_{e}$). We
suggest that the central concentration of the GCs is likely produced by the
dynamical friction of this merger. This would make UGC 7346 a unique case of a
galaxy caught in the earlier stages of NSC formation. The formation of NSCs due
to collapse of GCs by dynamical friction in dwarf mergers would provide a
natural explanation of the environmental correlations found for the nucleation
fraction for early-type dwarf galaxies, whereby denser environments host
galaxies with a higher nucleation fraction.

their energetics. We perform radiative-hydrodynamical galaxy formation
simulations ($18 \, \mathrm{pc}$ spatial resolution in the interstellar medium;
ISM) of an isolated dwarf galaxy ($M_{\star}=10^{8}\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$) with
the RAMSES-RTZ code, accounting for non-equilibrium cooling and chemistry
coupled to radiative transfer. We further implement a new adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) strategy to resolve the local gas cooling length, allowing us
to gradually increase the resolution in the stellar-feedback-powered outflows,
from $\geq 200 \, \mathrm{pc}$ to $18 \, \mathrm{pc}$. The propagation of
outflows into the inner circumgalactic medium (CGM) is significantly modified
by this additional resolution, but the ISM, star formation and feedback remain
by and large the same. With increasing resolution in the diffuse gas, the cold
($T < 8 \times 10^{3} \, \mathrm{K}$) phase of the outflow gets incrementally
larger, colder and faster-moving, while the hot phase ($T > 8 \times 10^{4} \,
\mathrm{K}$) is hotter and more energetic. This leads to greater than five-fold
increases in the time-averaged mass, energy and metal outflow rates away from
the galaxy ($r=5\, \mathrm{kpc}$) and a $\approx$50 per cent increase in the
number of sightlines with $N_{\text{OVI}} \geq 10^{13}\, \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$.
Such a highly significant boost to the energetics of outflows without new
feedback mechanisms or channels strongly motivates future studies quantifying
the efficiency with which better-resolved multiphase outflows regulate galactic

medium to reionize it, galaxy formation and reionization were both highly
inhomogeneous in time and space, and fully-coupled by mutual feedback. To show
how this imprinted the UV luminosity function (UVLF) of reionization-era
galaxies, we use our large-scale, radiation-hydrodynamics simulation CoDa II to
derive the time- and space-varying halo mass function and UVLF, from
$z\simeq6$-15. That UVLF correlates strongly with local reionization redshift:
earlier-reionizing regions have UVLFs that are higher, more extended to
brighter magnitudes, and flatter at the faint end than later-reionizing regions
observed at the same $z$. In general, as a region reionizes, the faint-end
slope of its local UVLF flattens, and, by $z=6$ (when reionization ended), the
global UVLF, too, exhibits a flattened faint-end slope, `rolling-over' at
$M_\text{UV}\gtrsim-17$. CoDa II's UVLF is broadly consistent with
cluster-lensed galaxy observations of the Hubble Frontier Fields at $z=6$-8,
including the faint end, except for the faintest data point at $z=6$, based on
one galaxy at $M_\text{UV}=-12.5$. According to CoDa II, the probability of
observing the latter is $\sim5\%$. However, the effective volume searched at
this magnitude is very small, and is thus subject to significant cosmic
variance. We find that previous methods adopted to calculate the uncertainty
due to cosmic variance underestimated it on such small scales by a factor of
2-3.5, primarily by underestimating the variance in halo abundance when the
sample volume is small.

parameter optimization techniques in machine learning, variational quantum
algorithms are one of the most promising applications of a near-term quantum
computer. However, the cost function landscape of a randomly initialized PQC is
often too flat, limiting trainability of the model beyond tens of qubits. This
problem, dubbed barren plateaus, gained lots of attention recently, but a
general solution is still not available. In this paper, we solve this problem
for the Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA), which is widely studied for
solving quantum many-body problems. After showing that a circuit described by
local Hamiltonian evolution does not have exponentially small gradients, we
derive parameter conditions such that the HVA is well approximated by local
Hamiltonian evolution. Based on this result, we further propose an
initialization scheme for the variational quantum eigensolver as well as a
parameter-constrained ansatz that is free from barren plateaus.

advertising platforms since their inception. Budget pacing systems seek to
optimize advertiser returns subject to budget constraints through smooth
spending of advertiser budgets. In the past few years, autobidding products
that provide real-time bidding as a service to advertisers have seen a
prominent rise in adoption. A popular autobidding stategy is value maximization
subject to return-on-spend (ROS) constraints. For historical or business
reasons, the algorithms that govern these two services, namely budget pacing
and RoS pacing, are not necessarily always a single unified and coordinated
entity that optimizes a global objective subject to both constraints. The
purpose of this work is to study the benefits of coordinating budget and RoS
pacing services from an empirical and theoretical perspective.
  We compare (a) a sequential algorithm that first constructs the advertiser's
ROS-pacing bid and then lowers that bid for budget pacing, with (b) the optimal
joint algorithm that optimizes advertiser returns subject to both budget and
ROS constraints. We establish the superiority of joint optimization both
theoretically as well as empirically based on data from a large advertising
platform. In the process, we identify a third algorithm with minimal
interaction between services that retains the theoretical properties of the
joint optimization algorithm and performs almost as well empirically as the
joint optimization algorithm. This algorithm eases the transition from a
sequential to a fully joint implementation by minimizing the amount of
interaction between the two services.

Mishima and Stanley [Nature 392, 164 (1998) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 334
(2000)] sought to shed light on this problem by studying the melting curves of
different ice polymorphs and their metastable continuation in the vicinity of
the expected location of the liquid-liquid transition and its associated
critical point. Based on the continuous or discontinuous changes in slope of
the melting curves, Mishima suggested that the liquid-liquid critical point
lies between the melting curves of ice III and ice V. Here, we explore this
conjecture using molecular dynamics simulations with a purely-predictive
machine learning model based on ab initio quantum-mechanical calculations. We
study the melting curves of ices III, IV, V, VI, and XIII using this model and
find that the melting lines of all the studied ice polymorphs are supercritical
and do not intersect the liquid-liquid transition locus. We also find a
pronounced, yet continuous, change in slope of the melting lines upon crossing
of the locus of maximum compressibility of the liquid. Finally, we analyze
critically the literature in light of our findings, and conclude that the
scenario in which melting curves are supercritical is favored by the most
recent computational and experimental evidence. Thus, although the
preponderance of experimental and computational evidence is consistent with the
existence of a second critical point in water, the behavior of the melting
lines of ice polymorphs does not provide strong evidence in support of this
viewpoint, according to our calculations.

propagation of light as if it were under the influence of a magnetic field even

engineered via periodic modulations of photonic lattices such that the
effective coupling coefficients after one period become complex-valued. In this
work, we investigate the possibility to introduce randomness into artificial
gauge fields by applying local random phase shifts in the modulation of
lattices of optical waveguides. We first study the elemental unit consisting of
two coupled single-mode waveguides and determine the effective complex-valued
coupling coefficient after one period of the modulation as a function of the
phase shift, the modulation amplitude and the modulation frequency. Thereby we
identify the regime where varying the modulation phase yields sufficiently
large changes of the effective coupling coefficient to induce Anderson
localization. Using these results, we demonstrate numerically the onset of
Anderson localization in 1D- and 2D-lattices of x-, and helically-modulated
waveguides via randomly choosing the modulation phases of the individual
waveguides. Besides further fundamental investigations of wave propagation in
the presence of random gauge fields, our findings enable the engineering of the
coupling coefficients without changing the footprint of the overall lattice. As
a proof of concept, we demonstrate how to engineer out-of-phase modulated
lattices which exhibit dynamic localization and defect-free surface states.
Therefore, we anticipate that the modulation phase will play an important role

upgraded at the University of Washington for its move from Kitt Peak National
Observatory's Mayall 4m telescope to the Apache Point Observatory's ARC 3.5m
telescope. One of the additions to KOSMOS is a slitviewer, which requires the
fabrication of reflective slits, as KOSMOS previously used matte slits machined
via wire EDM. We explore a novel method of slit fabrication using
nanofabrication methods and compare the slit edge roughness, width uniformity,
and the resulting scattering of the new fabricated slits to the original slits.
We find the kerf surface of the chemically-etched reflective silicon slits are
generally smoother than the machined matte slits, with an upper limit average
roughness of 0.42 $\pm$ 0.03 $\mu$m versus 1.06 $\pm$ 0.04 $\mu$m respectively.
The etched slits have width standard deviations of 6 $\pm$ 3 $\mu$m versus 10
$\pm$ 6 $\mu$m, respectively. The scattering for the chemically-etched slits is
higher than that of the machined slits, showing that the reflectivity is the
major contributor to scattering, not the roughness. This scattering, however,
can be effectively reduced to zero with proper background subtraction. As slit
widths increase, scattering increases for both types of slits, as expected.
Future work will consist of testing and comparing the throughput and
spectrophotometric data quality of these nanofabricated slits to the machined
slits with on-sky data, in addition to making the etched slits more robust
against breakage and finalizing the slit manufacturing process.

is implemented in 22 nm technology using a dual power supply. The high and low
supply voltages (VddH & VddL) are set as 0.8 V and 0.4 V respectively. The key
design features of ULPLS include a current limiting PMOS diode, a voltage

In the ocean,
self-propelled mesozooplankton generate vortices while swimming within a weakly
stratified fluid. While large-scale biogenic transport has been observed during
vertical migration in the wild and lab experiments, little focus has been given
to the evolution of induced vortex rings as a function of their propagation
direction relative to the density gradient. In this study, the evolution of an
isolated vortex ring crossing the interface of a stable two-layer system is
examined as a function of its translation direction with respect to gravity.
The vortex ring size and position are visualized using Planar Induced
Fluorescence (PLIF) and the induced vorticity field derived from Particle Image
Velocimetry (PIV) is examined. It is found that the production of baroclinic
vorticity significantly affects the propagation of vortex rings crossing the
density interface. As a result, any expected symmetry between vortex rings
traveling from dense to light fluids and from light to dense fluids breaks
down. In turn, the maximum penetration depth of the vortex ring occurs in the
case in which the vortex propagates against the density gradient due to the
misalignment of the pressure and density gradients. Our results have
far-reaching implications for the characterization of local ecosystems in
marine environments.

fairness assessments in computer vision. These metrics successfully
incentivized performance improvements on person-centric tasks such as face
analysis and are used to understand risks of modern models. However, there is a
lack of discussion on the vulnerabilities of these measurements for more
complex computer vision tasks. In this paper, we consider multi-label image
classification and, specifically, object categorization tasks. First, we
highlight design choices and trade-offs for measurement that involve more
nuance than discussed in prior computer vision literature. These challenges are
related to the necessary scale of data, definition of groups for images, choice
of metric, and dataset imbalances. Next, through two case studies using modern
vision models, we demonstrate that naive implementations of these assessments
are brittle. We identify several design choices that look merely like
implementation details but significantly impact the conclusions of assessments,
both in terms of magnitude and direction (on which group the classifiers work
best) of disparities. Based on ablation studies, we propose some
recommendations to increase the reliability of these assessments. Finally,
through a qualitative analysis we find that concepts with large disparities
tend to have varying definitions and representations between groups, with
inconsistencies across datasets and annotators. While this result suggests
avenues for mitigation through more consistent data collection, it also
highlights that ambiguous label definitions remain a challenge when performing
model assessments. Vision models are expanding and becoming more ubiquitous; it
is even more important that our disparity assessments accurately reflect the
true performance of models.

effectiveness and enjoyment of the exergame in different study conditions. The
results show that there was a statistically significant difference in terms of
task completion time between the two orientations. However, no significant
differences were found in the number of mistakes in both orientation and
configuration of the virtual exergame. This can lead to customizing therapy
while maintaining the same level of intensity. That is, if a patient has
restricted lower limb mobility and requires to be seated, they can use the
orientations interchangeably. The results of resistance change generated from

by prompts to solve new tasks without any fine-tuning. Moreover, they can be
applied to a wide range of different media and problem domains, ranging from
image and video processing to robot control learning. Because they provide a
blueprint for solving many tasks in artificial intelligence, they have been
called Foundation Models. After a brief introduction to basic NLP models the
main pre-trained language models BERT, GPT and sequence-to-sequence transformer
are described, as well as the concepts of self-attention and context-sensitive
embedding. Then, different approaches to improving these models are discussed,
such as expanding the pre-training criteria, increasing the length of input
texts, or including extra knowledge. An overview of the best-performing models
for about twenty application areas is then presented, e.g., question answering,
translation, story generation, dialog systems, generating images from text,
etc. For each application area, the strengths and weaknesses of current models
are discussed, and an outlook on further developments is given. In addition,
links are provided to freely available program code. A concluding chapter
summarizes the economic opportunities, mitigation of risks, and potential
developments of AI.

Furthermore, this paper proposes a residual softmax (R-softmax) that is

solving unconstrained minimization problems, largely due to their favorable
superlinear convergence property. However, existing results for these
algorithms are limited as they provide either (i) a global convergence
guarantee with an asymptotic superlinear convergence rate, or (ii) a local
non-asymptotic superlinear rate for the case that the initial point and the
initial Hessian approximation are chosen properly. Furthermore, these results
are not composable, since when the iterates of the globally convergent methods
reach the region of local superlinear convergence, it cannot be guaranteed the
Hessian approximation matrix will satisfy the required conditions for a
non-asymptotic local superlienar convergence rate. In this paper, we close this
gap and present the first globally convergent quasi-Newton method with an
explicit non-asymptotic superlinear convergence rate. Unlike classical
quasi-Newton methods, we build our algorithm upon the hybrid proximal
extragradient method and propose a novel online learning framework for updating
the Hessian approximation matrices. Specifically, guided by the convergence
analysis, we formulate the Hessian approximation update as an online convex
optimization problem in the space of matrices, and relate the bounded regret of
the online problem to the superlinear convergence of our method.

a way that also guides them to generate text aligned with human preferences. We
benchmark five objectives for pretraining with human feedback across three

Conditional training reduces the rate of undesirable content by up to an order
of magnitude, both when generating without a prompt and with an

downstream task performance of standard LM pretraining, both before and after
task-specific finetuning. Pretraining with human feedback results in much
better preference satisfaction than standard LM pretraining followed by
finetuning with feedback, i.e., learning and then unlearning undesirable

JEIT and JOIST training (CJJT) that benefits from modality matching, encoder
text injection and ILM training. Both JEIT and CJJT can foster a more effective

importance, useful in a variety of applications and experimental settings, and
is difficult to accomplish in general. Symmetries imply conservation laws,
which partition Hilbert space into invariant subspaces of the time-evolution
operator, each of which is demarcated according to its conserved quantity. We
show that, starting from a chosen basis, any invariant, symmetry-protected
subspaces which are diagonal in that basis are discoverable using transitive
closure on graphs representing state-to-state transitions under $k$-local
unitary operations. Importantly, the discovery of these subspaces relies
neither upon the explicit identification of a symmetry operator or its
eigenvalues nor upon the construction of matrices of the full Hilbert space
dimension. We introduce two classical algorithms, which efficiently compute and
elucidate features of these subspaces. The first algorithm explores the entire
symmetry-protected subspace of an initial state in time complexity linear to
the size of the subspace by closing local basis state-to-basis state
transitions. The second algorithm determines, with bounded error, if a given
measurement outcome of a dynamically-generated state is within the
symmetry-protected subspace of the state in which the dynamical system is
initialized. We demonstrate the applicability of these algorithms by performing
post-selection on data generated from emulated noisy quantum simulations of
three different dynamical systems: the Heisenberg-XXX model and the $T_6$ and
$F_4$ quantum cellular automata. Due to their efficient computability and
indifference to identifying the underlying symmetry, these algorithms lend
themselves to the post-selection of quantum computer data, optimized classical

The outcome of the analysis is strongly dependent on the parameter values used

efficacy of these syntactic parsing based embedding methods when controlling

that constituency parsers help explain activations in the temporal lobe and

semantic signals from BERT are more effective compared to any of the syntactic

between inference accuracy and input data size. Frequency-domain learning in 2D
computer vision tasks has shown that 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN)
have a stationary spectral bias towards low-frequency channels so that
high-frequency channels can be pruned with no or little accuracy degradation.
However, frequency-domain learning has not been studied in the context of 3D
CNNs with 3D volumetric data. In this paper, we study frequency-domain learning
for volumetric-based 3D data perception to reveal the spectral bias and the
accuracy-input-data-size tradeoff of 3D CNNs. Our study finds that 3D CNNs are
sensitive to a limited number of critical frequency channels, especially
low-frequency channels. Experiment results show that frequency-domain learning
can significantly reduce the size of volumetric-based 3D inputs (based on
spectral bias) while achieving comparable accuracy with conventional
spatial-domain learning approaches. Specifically, frequency-domain learning is
able to reduce the input data size by 98% in 3D shape classification while
limiting the average accuracy drop within 2%, and by 98% in the 3D point cloud
semantic segmentation with a 1.48% mean-class accuracy improvement while
limiting the mean-class IoU loss within 1.55%. Moreover, by learning from
higher-resolution 3D data (i.e., 2x of the original image in the spatial
domain), frequency-domain learning improves the mean-class accuracy and
mean-class IoU by 3.04% and 0.63%, respectively, while achieving an 87.5% input
data size reduction in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation.

exoplanets. However, a detailed reaction kinetic model that incorporates both
UV photochemistry and thermal chemistry is challenging due to the massive size
of the chemical system as well as to the lack of understanding of
photochemistry compared to thermal-only chemistry. Here, we utilize an
automatic chemical reaction mechanism generator to build a high-fidelity
thermochemical reaction kinetic model later then incorporated with
UV-photochemistry enhanced by metastable triplet-state carbon monoxide (a3Pi).
Our model results show that two different photochemical reactions driven by
Lyman-a photons (i.e. H2 + CO(a3Pi) -> H + HCO and CO(X1Sig+) + CO(a3Pi) ->
C(3P) + CO2) can enhance thermal chemistry resulting in significant increases
in the formation of CH4, H2O, and CO2 in H2-dominated systems with trace
amounts of CO, which qualitatively matches with the observations from previous
experimental studies. Our model also suggests that at temperatures above 2000
K, thermal chemistry becomes the dominant process. Finally, the chemistry
simulated up to 2500 K does not produce any larger species such as C3 species,
benzene or larger (i.e. PAHs). This might indicate that the photochemistry of
C2 species such as C2H2 might play a key role in the formation of organic
aerosols observed in the previous experimental study.

cognitive load imposed by reading news headlines related to COVID-19 claims,
within the context of a fact-checking system, we conducted a within-subject,

the person's prior beliefs. In contrast, checking false claims imposed a higher
cognitive load when the news headlines provided correct evidence for a claim

beliefs after examining a claim did not have a significant relationship with
cognitive load while reading the news headlines. The results illustrate that
reading news headlines related to true and false claims in the fact-checking

$n$ identical and anonymous agents, where one of the opinions (which is called
correct) represents a piece of information to disseminate. In more detail, one
source agent initially holds the correct opinion and remains with this opinion
throughout the execution. The goal for non-source agents is to quickly agree on
this correct opinion, and do that robustly, i.e., from any initial
configuration. The system evolves in rounds. In each round, one agent chosen
uniformly at random is activated: unless it is the source, the agent pulls the
opinions of $\ell$ random agents and then updates its opinion according to some
rule. We consider a restricted setting, in which agents have no memory and they
only revise their opinions on the basis of those of the agents they currently
sample. As restricted as it is, this setting encompasses very popular opinion
dynamics, such as the voter model and best-of-$k$ majority rules.
  Qualitatively speaking, we show that lack of memory prevents efficient
convergence. Specifically, we prove that no dynamics can achieve correct
convergence in an expected number of steps that is sub-quadratic in $n$, even
under a strong version of the model in which activated agents have complete
access to the current configuration of the entire system, i.e., the case
$\ell=n$. Conversely, we prove that the simple voter model (in which $\ell=1$)
correctly solves the problem, while almost matching the aforementioned lower
bound.
  These results suggest that, in contrast to symmetric consensus problems (that
do not involve a notion of correct opinion), fast convergence on the correct
opinion using stochastic opinion dynamics may indeed require the use of memory.
This insight may reflect on natural information dissemination processes that
rely on a few knowledgeable individuals.

and materials, anharmonic terms of the potential energy surface are commonly
computed numerically, with an associated cost that rapidly increases with the
size of the system. Recently, an efficient approach to calculate cubic and
quartic interatomic force constants in the basis of normal modes [Theor. Chem.
Acc., 120, 23 (2008)] was implemented in the Crystal program [J. Chem. Theory
Comput., 15, 3755-3765 (2019)]. By applying group theory, we are able to
further reduce the associated computational cost, as the exploitation of point
symmetry can significantly reduce the number of distinct atomically displaced
nuclear configurations to be explicitly explored for energy and forces
calculations. Our strategy stems from Wigner's theorem and the fact that normal
modes are bases of the irreducible representations (irreps) of the point group.
The proposed group theoretical approach is implemented in the Crystal program
and its efficiency assessed on six test case systems: four molecules (methane,
CH4; tetrahedrane, C4H4; cyclo-exasulfur, S6; cubane, C8H8), and two
three-dimensional crystals (Magnesium oxide, MgO; and a prototypical
Zinc-imidazolate framework, ZIF-8). The speedup imparted by this approach is
consistently very large in all high-symmetry molecular and periodic systems,
peaking at 76% for MgO.

achieve this advantage, we exploit efficient quantum mean estimation technique
that provides quadratic improvement in the number of i.i.d. samples needed to
estimate the mean of sub-Gaussian random variables as compared to classical

training of deep neural networks across multiple clients. Split learning
achieves this by splitting a neural network between a client and a server such
that the client computes the initial set of layers, and the server computes the

the client model towards learning any task of its choice, e.g. towards
outputting easily invertible values. With a concrete example already proposed

present a significant risk for the data privacy of split learning clients.
  We propose two methods for a split learning client to detect if it is being

obstacles to obtaining reliable computational predictions for these systems.
The phenothiazine guests exist in solution as racemic mixtures of enantiomers
related by nitrogen inversions that bind the hosts in various binding poses,

by a series of absolute and relative binding alchemical steps for each chemical

applications and there is a vast literature on developing metrics and efficient

communities, a range of new approaches have been developed for comparing graphs
with node attributes, leveraging ideas such as the Optimal Transport (OT) and
the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) graph isomorphism test. Two state-of-the-art
representatives are the OTC distance proposed by O'Connor et al., 2022 and the
WL distance by Chen et al.,2022. Interestingly, while these two distances are
developed based on different ideas, we observe that they both view graphs as
Markov chains, and are deeply connected. Indeed, in this paper, we propose a
unified framework to generate distances for Markov chains (thus including
(directed) graphs with node attributes), which we call the Optimal Transport
Markov (OTM) distances, that encompass both the OTC and the WL distances. We
further introduce a special one-parameter family of distances within our OTM
framework, called the discounted WL distance. We show that the discounted WL
distance has nice theoretical properties and can address several limitations of
the existing OTC and WL distances. Furthermore, contrary to the OTC and the WL
distances, we show our new discounted WL distance can be differentiated (after
an entropy-regularization similar to the Sinkhorn distance), making it suitable
for use in learning frameworks, e.g., as the reconstruction loss in a graph
generative model.

the connectivity principle for categorizing similar and dissimilar data into
different groups. Although classical clustering algorithms such as K-means are
efficient techniques, they often trap in local optima and have a slow
convergence rate in solving high-dimensional problems. To address these issues,
many successful meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and intelligence-based
methods have been introduced to attain the optimal solution in a reasonable
time. They are designed to escape from a local optimum problem by allowing
flexible movements or random behaviors. In this study, we attempt to
conceptualize a powerful approach using the three main components: Chimp
Optimization Algorithm (ChOA), Generalized Normal Distribution Algorithm
(GNDA), and Opposition-Based Learning (OBL) method. Firstly, two versions of
ChOA with two different independent groups' strategies and seven chaotic maps,
entitled ChOA(I) and ChOA(II), are presented to achieve the best possible
result for data clustering purposes. Secondly, a novel combination of ChOA and
GNDA algorithms with the OBL strategy is devised to solve the major
shortcomings of the original algorithms. Lastly, the proposed ChOAGNDA method
is a Selective Opposition (SO) algorithm based on ChOA and GNDA, which can be
used to tackle large and complex real-world optimization problems, particularly
data clustering applications. The results are evaluated against seven popular
meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and eight recent state-of-the-art
clustering techniques. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed work
significantly outperforms other existing methods in terms of the achievement in
minimizing the Sum of Intra-Cluster Distances (SICD), obtaining the lowest
Error Rate (ER), accelerating the convergence speed, and finding the optimal
cluster centers.

are found to be sensitive to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose
Generative Causal Representation Learning (GCRL) which leverages causality to
facilitate knowledge transfer under distribution shifts. While we evaluate the
effectiveness of our proposed method in human trajectory prediction models,
GCRL can be applied to other domains as well. First, we propose a novel causal
model that explains the generative factors in motion forecasting datasets using
features that are common across all environments and with features that are
specific to each environment. Selection variables are used to determine which
parts of the model can be directly transferred to a new environment without
fine-tuning. Second, we propose an end-to-end variational learning paradigm to
learn the causal mechanisms that generate observations from features. GCRL is
supported by strong theoretical results that imply identifiability of the
causal model under certain assumptions. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world motion forecasting datasets show the robustness and effectiveness of
our proposed method for knowledge transfer under zero-shot and low-shot
settings by substantially outperforming the prior motion forecasting models on
out-of-distribution prediction. Our code is available at

watermarking techniques. However, the protection of image-processing neural
networks remains a challenge, with only a limited number of methods being
developed. The objective of these techniques is to embed a watermark in the
output images of the target generative network, so that the watermark signal
can be detected in the output of a surrogate model obtained through model
extraction attacks. This promising technique, however, has certain limits.
Analysis of the frequency domain reveals that the watermark signal is mainly
concealed in the high-frequency components of the output. Thus, we propose an
overwriting attack that involves forging another watermark in the output of the
generative network. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this
attack in sabotaging existing watermarking schemes for image-processing
networks, with an almost 100% success rate. To counter this attack, we devise
an adversarial framework for the watermarking network. The framework
incorporates a specially designed adversarial training step, where the
watermarking network is trained to defend against the overwriting network,
thereby enhancing its robustness. Additionally, we observe an overfitting
phenomenon in the existing watermarking method, which can render it
ineffective. To address this issue, we modify the training process to eliminate
the overfitting problem.

this breakdown. We use the R-matrix propagation method in a hyperspherical

sections and three-body recombination rates with a finite intraspecies

interspecies scattering length is found, which is due to the presence of the
near-threshold trimer state at the atom-dimer threshold ($^{40}$K +

the generator network is usually either an Up-CNN for image generation or an

to-be-studied quantum system is relative to. The statistic physics and
thermodynamics of the quantum frame fields is studied by the density matrix
obtained by the Gaussian approximation. The induced Ricci flow of the frame
fields and the Ricci-DeTurck flow of the frame fields associated with the

a Shannon entropy in terms of the density matrix, which monotonically flows and
achieves its maximal value at the flow limit, called the Gradient Shrinking
Ricci Soliton (GSRS), corresponding to a thermal equilibrium state of
spacetime. A relative Shannon entropy w.r.t. the maximal entropy gives a

Perelman's analogies between his formalism and the thermodynamics of the frame

validity of the Equivalence Principle to the quantum level, the quantum frame
fields theory at low energy gives an effective theory of gravity, a scale
dependent Einstein-Hilbert action plus a cosmological constant is recovered. As
a possible underlying microscopic theory of gravity, the theory is also applied
to understand the thermodynamics of the Schwarzschild black hole.

FL-based approaches employ batch learning manner, which makes the pre-trained

correlation among clients via Graph Attention Network (GAT), catering to the
dynamic changes of spatial closeness caused by traffic fluctuation.

entire population is one of the central problems in statistics. Most classical
techniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and
break down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple,
adaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \emph{adaptive data analysis} was
formalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and
Ullman (FOCS, 2014).
  We identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries
will continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only
requirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs
few bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is
sufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this
subsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world
scenarios not covered by prior work.
  In addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework
by designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and

photographers by generating the cropping boxes with improved composition
quality. Cropping box regression approaches learn the beauty of composition
from annotated cropping boxes. However, the bias of annotations leads to
quasi-trivial recomposing results, which has an obvious tendency to the average
location of training samples. The crux of this predicament is that the task is
naively treated as a box regression problem, where rare samples might be
dominated by normal samples, and the composition patterns of rare samples are
not well exploited. Observing that similar composition patterns tend to be
shared by the cropping boundaries annotated nearly, we argue to find the beauty
of composition from the rare samples by clustering the samples with similar
cropping boundary annotations, ie, similar composition patterns. We propose a
novel Contrastive Composition Clustering (C2C) to regularize the composition
features by contrasting dynamically established similar and dissimilar pairs.
In this way, common composition patterns of multiple images can be better
summarized, which especially benefits the rare samples and endows our model
with better generalizability to render nontrivial results. Extensive
experimental results show the superiority of our model compared with prior
arts. We also illustrate the philosophy of our design with an interesting

detection because of the lacking take into account the confusion of pedestrian
information and background noise in Color and Thermal images. Here we propose a
multispectral pedestrian detection algorithm, which mainly consists of a
cascaded information enhancement module and a cross-modal attention feature
fusion module. On the one hand, the cascaded information enhancement module
adopts the channel and spatial attention mechanism to perform attention
weighting on the features fused by the cascaded feature fusion block. Moreover,
it multiplies the single-modal features with the attention weight element by
element to enhance the pedestrian features in the single-modal and thus
suppress the interference from the background. On the other hand, the
cross-modal attention feature fusion module mines the features of both Color
and Thermal modalities to complement each other, then the global features are
constructed by adding the cross-modal complemented features element by element,
which are attentionally weighted to achieve the effective fusion of the two
modal features. Finally, the fused features are input into the detection head
to detect and locate pedestrians. Extensive experiments have been performed on
two improved versions of annotations (sanitized annotations and paired
annotations) of the public dataset KAIST. The experimental results show that
our method demonstrates a lower pedestrian miss rate and more accurate
pedestrian detection boxes compared to the comparison method. Additionally, the

well-known over-smoothing problem facing deeper GNNs. However, they are
sub-optimal without utilizing the information from distant nodes, i.e., the
long-range dependencies. The mainstream methods in the graph classification
task can extract the long-range dependencies either by designing the pooling
operations or incorporating the higher-order neighbors, while they have evident
drawbacks by modifying the original graph structure, which may result in
information loss in graph structure learning. In this paper, by justifying the
smaller influence of the over-smoothing problem in the graph classification
task, we evoke the importance of stacking-based GNNs and then employ them to
capture the long-range dependencies without modifying the original graph
structure. To achieve this, two design needs are given for stacking-based GNNs,
i.e., sufficient model depth and adaptive skip-connection schemes. By
transforming the two design needs into designing data-specific inter-layer

Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed LRGNN can achieve

time. However, as the number of tracked knowledge concepts increases, the time
complexity of MCKT predicting student performance increases exponentially (also
called explaining away problem. In addition, the existing MCKT models only
consider the relationship between students' knowledge status and problems when
modeling students' responses but ignore the relationship between knowledge
concepts in the same problem. To address these challenges, we propose an
inTerpretable pRobAbilistiC gEnerative moDel (TRACED), which can track
students' numerous knowledge concepts mastery probabilities over time. To solve
\emph{explain away problem}, we design Long and Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based
networks to approximate the posterior distribution, predict students' future
performance, and propose a heuristic algorithm to train LSTMs and probabilistic
graphical model jointly. To better model students' exercise responses, we
proposed a logarithmic linear model with three interactive strategies, which
models students' exercise responses by considering the relationship among
students' knowledge status, knowledge concept, and problems. We conduct
experiments with four real-world datasets in three knowledge-driven tasks. The
experimental results show that TRACED outperforms existing knowledge tracing
methods in predicting students' future performance and can learn the
relationship among students, knowledge concepts, and problems from students'
exercise sequences. We also conduct several case studies. The case studies show
that TRACED exhibits excellent interpretability and thus has the potential for
personalized automatic feedback in the real-world educational environment.

However, its cross-domain performance is unsatisfactory. As a result, the
domain generalization (DG) method has gained more attention in FAS. Existing
methods treat FAS as a simple binary classification task and propose a
heuristic training objective to learn domain-invariant features. However, there
is no theoretical explanation of what a domain-invariant feature is.
Additionally, the lack of theoretical support makes domain generalization
techniques such as adversarial training lack training stability. To address
these issues, this paper proposes the EnfoMax framework, which uses information
theory to analyze cross-domain FAS tasks. This framework provides theoretical
guarantees and optimization objectives for domain-generalized FAS tasks.
EnfoMax maximizes the domain entropy and mutual information of live samples in

and on the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm for coupling the
fluid with the immersed boundary. The new Fourier spectral immersed boundary
(FSIB) method gives improved boundary resolution in comparison to the standard
IB method. The interpolated velocity field, in which the boundary moves, is
analytically divergence-free. The FSIB method is gridless and has the
meritorious properties of volume conservation, exact translation invariance,
conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy. We verify these
advantages of the FSIB method numerically both for the Stokes equations and for
the Navier-Stokes equations in both two and three space dimensions. The FSIB
method converges faster than the IB method. In particular, we observe
second-order convergence in various problems for the Navier-Stokes equations in
three dimensions. The FSIB method is also computationally efficient with
complexity of $O(N^3\log(N))$ per time step for $N^3$ Fourier modes in three
dimensions.

with a denumerable collection of types. Among-type transitions are inspired by
the Tug-of-War process introduced in Mcfarland et al. (2014) as a mathematical
model for competition of advantageous driver mutations and deleterious
passenger mutations in cancer cells. We introduce a version of the model in
which a driver mutation pushes the state of the cell $L$-units up, while a
passenger mutation pulls it $1$ unit down. The distribution of time to
divisions depends on the type of cell, which is an integer. First, we analyze
the probability of extinction of the process, using approach in Hautphenne
(2013). Then, we consider the properties of the mean process, using theories in
Seneta (2006). Finally, we consider the process in an infinitely long cell
lineage of cells, using theory of difference equations in Bodine (2015),
martingales, and random walk. The analysis leads to the result that under
driver dominance, the process escapes to infinity, while under passenger
dominance, it leads to a limit distribution. Our analysis reveals an asymmetric
relationship between impacts of the two types of mutations. The process is
driven to extinction with probability less than $1$. Under passenger dominance
regime (downward-trend) there exists with a positive probability a ""reservoir""
of cells with a wide range of types (fitnesses). In the context of cancer cell
populations, this may mean that ""indolent"" cancer cell colonies may allow the
biological process to rebound if conditions change, as in the ""punctuated

active sensing that processes signals in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. This
paper explores three key features of the OTFS framework, and explains their
value to applications. The first feature is a compact and sparse DD domain
parameterization of the wireless channel, where the parameters map directly to
physical attributes of the reflectors that comprise the scattering environment,
and as a consequence these parameters evolve predictably. The second feature is
a novel waveform / modulation technique, matched to the DD channel model, that
embeds information symbols in the DD domain. The relation between channel
inputs and outputs is localized, non-fading and predictable, even in the
presence of significant delay and Doppler spread, and as a consequence the
channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. By avoiding fading, the post
equalization SNR remains constant across all information symbols in a packet,
so that bit error performance is superior to contemporary multi-carrier
waveforms. Further, the OTFS carrier waveform is a localized pulse in the DD
domain, making it possible to separate reflectors along both delay and Doppler
simultaneously, and to achieve a high-resolution delay-Doppler radar image of
the environment. In other words, the DD parameterization provides a common
mathematical framework for communication and radar. This is the third feature
of the OTFS framework, and it is ideally suited to intelligent transportation
systems involving self-driving cars and unmanned ground/aerial vehicles which
are self/network controlled. The OTFS waveform is able to support stable and
superior performance over a wide range of user speeds.

decreases, a phenomenon known as the Hall-Petch relation. Such relation,
however, breaks down when the grains become too small. Experimental studies
have circumvented this problem in a set of Ni-Mo alloys by stabilizing the
grain boundaries (GB). Here, using atomistic simulations with a machine
learning-based interatomic potential (ML-IAP), we demonstrate that the inverse
Hall-Petch relation can be correctly reproduced due to a change in the dominant
deformation mechanism as the grain becomes small in the Ni-Mo polycrystals. It
is found that the atomic von Mises strain can be significantly reduced by
either solute doping and/or annealing for small-grain-size polycrystals,
leading to the increased strength of the polycrystals. On the other hand, for
large-grain-size polycrystals, annealing weakens the material due to the large
atomic movements in GB regions. Over a broad range of grain size, the
superposition of the solute and annealing effects on polycrystals enhances the
strength of those with small grain size more than those with large ones, giving
rise to the continuous strengthening at extremely small grain sizes. Overall,
this study not only demonstrates the reliability of the ML-IAP, but also
provides a comprehensive atomistic view of complex strengthening mechanisms in
nanocrystals, opening up a new avenue to tailor their mechanical properties.

quantifying the uncertainty of deep neural networks in a way that provides

settings where the space of labels is simple, so prediction sets can be
arbitrary subsets of labels. For structured prediction problems where the space
of labels is exponential in size, even prediction sets containing a small

generation, we propose a solution that considers a restricted set of prediction
sets that can compactly be represented as partial programs, which are programs

procedures that improve ""fairness"" by conditioning out undesirable effects:
first, by conditioning directly on sensitive attributes, and second, by
clustering samples into groups and conditioning on cluster membership (blind to
protected group membership).

system should operate within the crystalline regime. In this paper, we provide
an explicit formula for reconstructing the Zak-OTFS I/O relation from a finite
number of received pilot symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain. This formula
makes it possible to study predictability of the Zak-OTFS I/O relation for a
sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints.
We analyze reconstruction accuracy for different choices of the delay and
Doppler periods, and of the pulse shaping filter. Reconstruction accuracy is
high when the crystallization condition is satisfied, implying that it is
possible to learn directly the I/O relation without needing to estimate the
underlying channel. This opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of
operation, which is especially useful when a traditional model-dependent mode
of operation (reliant on channel estimation) is out of reach (for example, when
the channel comprises of unresolvable paths, or exhibits a continuous
delay-Doppler profile such as in presence of acceleration). Our study clarifies
the fundamental origins of predictability by revealing how non-predictability
appears as a consequence of aliasing in the DD domain. This perspective leads
to a canonical decomposition of the effective DD channel as a sum of
predictable and non-predictable components, which we refer to as the

The measurements of the self-similar APG-TBL at the verge of separation, which
is referred to as 'strong APG-TBL' is compared with similar HSR 2C-2D PIV
measurements of a TBL under zero and mild APG to characterise the effect of the
APG on the TBL. In the strong APG-TBL, the outer scaled profiles of the first-
and second-order statistics, as well as the defect velocity exhibit
self-similarity over the measured streamwise domain of 3.3{\delta}. The
quadrant decomposition of the velocity fluctuations shows that the formation of
the outer peak in the Reynolds shear stress profile under APG is due to the
energisation of sweep motions of high-momentum fluid in the outer region of the
boundary layer. The RD decomposition of the mean skin friction shows that the
skin friction has larger contributions from ejections than sweeps. This is due
to the emergence of the outer peaks with a correspondingly diminishing of the
inner peaks in the turbulence production profiles. The skewness and flatness
profiles show that the zero skewness and minimum flatness locations of the
streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations collapse with the location of
the maximum Reynolds streamwise stress in the TBLs irrespective of the pressure
gradient imposed on the TBL.

search-related industrial applications. Given a user query, the system of EBR
aims to identify relevant information from a large corpus of documents that may
be tens or hundreds of billions in size. The storage and computation turn out
to be expensive and inefficient with massive documents and high concurrent
queries, making it difficult to further scale up. To tackle the challenge, we
propose a binary embedding-based retrieval (BEBR) engine equipped with a
recurrent binarization algorithm that enables customized bits per dimension.
Specifically, we compress the full-precision query and document embeddings,
formulated as float vectors in general, into a composition of multiple binary
vectors using a lightweight transformation model with residual multilayer
perception (MLP) blocks. We can therefore tailor the number of bits for
different applications to trade off accuracy loss and cost savings.
Importantly, we enable task-agnostic efficient training of the binarization
model using a new embedding-to-embedding strategy. We also exploit the
compatible training of binary embeddings so that the BEBR engine can support
indexing among multiple embedding versions within a unified system. To further
realize efficient search, we propose Symmetric Distance Calculation (SDC) to
achieve lower response time than Hamming codes. We successfully employed the
introduced BEBR to Tencent products, including Sogou, Tencent Video, QQ World,
etc. The binarization algorithm can be seamlessly generalized to various tasks
with multiple modalities. Extensive experiments on offline benchmarks and
online A/B tests demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method,
significantly saving 30%~50% index costs with almost no loss of accuracy at the
system level.

first} contribution is the design of a conforming companion operator $J$ from
the {\it conforming virtual element space} to the Sobolev space
$V:=H^1_0(\Omega)$, a modified virtual element scheme, and the \textit{a

without data oscillations. The {\it second} contribution is the extension of
the \textit{a priori} analysis to general second-order elliptic problems with
source term in $V^*$. The {\it third} contribution is an application of the
companion operator in a Poisson inverse source problem when the measurements
belong to $V^*$. The Tikhonov's regularization technique regularizes the
ill-posed inverse problem, and the conforming virtual element method
approximates the regularized problem given a finite measurement data. The
inverse problem is also discretised using the conforming virtual element method
and error estimates are established. Numerical tests on different polygonal

especially for variables strongly controlled by processes that are unresolved
by low-resolution (LR) models. This paper explores emerging machine learning
methods from the fields of image super-resolution (SR) and deep learning for
statistical downscaling of near-surface winds to convection-permitting scales.
Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are conditioned on LR
inputs from a global reanalysis to generate high-resolution (HR) surface winds
that emulate those simulated over North America by the Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model. Unlike traditional SR models, where LR inputs are
idealized coarsened versions of the HR images, WRF emulation involves
non-idealized LR inputs from a coarse-resolution reanalysis. In addition to
matching the statistical properties of WRF simulations, GANs quickly generate
HR fields with impressive realism. However, objectively assessing the realism
of the SR models requires careful selection of evaluation metrics. In
particular, performance measures based on spatial power spectra reveal the way
that GAN configurations change spatial structures in the generated fields,
where biases in spatial variability originate, and how models depend on
different LR covariates. Inspired by recent computer vision research, a novel
methodology that separates spatial frequencies in HR fields is used in an
attempt to optimize the SR GANs further. This method, called frequency
separation, resulted in deterioration in realism of the generated HR fields.
However, frequency separation did show how spatial structures are influenced by
the metrics used to optimize the SR models, which led to the development of a
more effective partial frequency separation approach.

paper investigates a practically-relevant scenario where robotic sensors are
introduced asynchronously and inter-robot communication is discrete,
event-driven, local and asynchronous. Furthermore, we work with lazy robots;
i.e., the robots seek to minimize their area of responsibility by
equipartitioning the domain to be covered. We adapt a well-known algorithm
which is practicable and known to generally work well for coverage problems.
For a specially chosen geometry of the spatial domain, we show that there
exists a non-trivial sequence of inter-robot communication events which leads
to an instantaneous loss of coverage when the number of robots exceeds a
certain threshold. The same sequence of events preserves coverage and, further,
leads to an equipartition of the domain when the number of robots is smaller
than the threshold. This result demonstrates that coverage guarantees for a
given algorithm might be sensitive to the number of robots and, therefore, may
not scale in obvious ways. It also suggests that when such algorithms are to be

robotics applications, such as autonomous navigation. Traditional SLAM
approaches infer the metric state of the robot along with a metric map of the

sensitive to measurement noise, sensor quality, and data association and are
still computationally expensive. Alternatively, some navigation and mapping
missions can be achieved using only qualitative geometric information, an
approach known as qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). We contribute a novel
probabilistic qualitative localization and mapping approach in this work. We
infer both the qualitative map and the qualitative state of the camera poses
(localization). For the first time, we also incorporate qualitative
probabilistic constraints between camera poses (motion model), improving
computation time and performance. Furthermore, we take advantage of qualitative
inference properties to achieve very fast approximated algorithms with good
performance. In addition, we show how to propagate probabilistic information
between nodes in the qualitative map, which improves estimation performance and
enables inference of unseen map nodes - an important building block for
qualitative active planning. We also conduct a study that shows how well we can
estimate unseen nodes. Our method particularly appeals to scenarios with few
salient landmarks and low-quality sensors. We evaluate our approach in

low complexity compared to the state-of-the-art. Our analysis also indicates
good prospects for using qualitative navigation and planning in real-world

features of each view are sent to a encoder to produce a compact view-specific
representation, respectively. Thus, we constrain the mutual information between
the common representation and view-specific representations to be minimal for
obtaining multi-level information. Further, the common representation and
view-specific representation are spliced to model the refined representation of
each view, which is fed into a decoder to reconstruct the initial data with
maximizing their mutual information. In order to form a comprehensive
representation, the common representation and all view-specific representations
are concatenated. Furthermore, to accommodate the comprehensive representation
better for the clustering task, we maximize the mutual information between an
instance and its k-nearest neighbors to enhance the intra-cluster aggregation,
thus inducing well separation of different clusters at the overall aspect.

and the techniques of zero-temperature field theory are no longer valid. The
dark matter number density modifies the vacuum giving it a non-negligible
particle occupation number. For fermionic dark matter, this occupation number
can be no larger than one. However, in the case of bosons the occupation number
is unbounded. If there is a large occupation number, the Bose enhancement needs
to be taken into consideration for any process involving particles which
interact with the dark matter. Because the occupation number scales inversely
with the dark matter mass, this effect is most prominent for ultralight dark
matter. In fact, the Bose enhancement effect from the background is so
significant for ultralight dark matter that, if dark matter is a dark photon,
the correction to the anomalous magnetic moment is larger than experimental
uncertainties for a mixing parameter of order $10^{-16}$ and a dark photon mass
of order $10^{-20}$ eV. Furthermore, the constraint on the mixing parameter

However, phase picking on DAS data is still a difficult problem due to the lack

high picking accuracy and good earthquake detection performance. We then apply

particular practical significance as they emerge as a leading system to realize
large-scale quantum computation~\cite{Arute2019,Wu2021}. Nevertheless, the
number of superconducting qubits on the same chip is severely limited by the

of quantum teleportation and remote computation over qubits on distant

the system through a distributed quantum computational

However, this goal has not been realized yet in experiments due to the
technical challenge of making a quantum interconnect between distant
superconducting chips and the inefficient transfer of flying microwave photons

agent reasoning. It is also common to disregard that a value-guided agent

intricately connect values at individual levels to norms at a collective level
by evaluating the outcomes most incentivized by the norms in place. We argue
that this type of normative reasoning, where agents are endowed with an
understanding of norms' moral implications, leads to value-awareness in
autonomous agents. Additionally, this capability paves the way for agents to
align the norms enforced in their societies with respect to the human values
instilled in them, by complementing the value-based reasoning on norms with
agreement mechanisms to help agents collectively agree on the best set of norms
that suit their human values. Overall, our agent model goes beyond the
treatment of values as inert labels by connecting them to normative reasoning
and to the social functionalities needed to integrate value-aware agents into

factors determining the localization performance, i.e., the margin and the
overlap between the discrepancy distributions (DDs) of normal and abnormal

Experiments on MVTec2D and MVTec3D show that CDO effectively mitigates the

collapse of a weak layer buried below a cohesive snow slab. This results in the
propagation of a subsidence, known as a collapse wave or anticrack. The slab
may eventually break and detach from the rest of the snowpack, provided that
the slope is steep enough to enable gravity to overcome the friction. The only
theoretical framework to date (Heierli 2005) proposed an explicit solution for
the propagation speed in steady state which could not account for weak layer
properties, was not mathematically bounded for certain values of the physical
constants involved, and could not explain the newly uncovered supershear
transition for steep slopes. Here, a new model for the stationary propagation
of anticracks is set up, so as to account for the anticrack speed regime on the
one hand, and the supershear regime on the other hand, the existence of which
has been recently revealed and ascertained by numerical simulations. The
results presented here seem consistent with most of the available data, and
highlight the role that the compaction of the weak layer can play in reducing
the anticrack speed. On the contrary, by storing energy upon failure and
suddenly releasing it at the crack tip, the weak layer elasticity could help
justify the higher speeds sometimes observed in both regimes. Finally, a more
accurate model is proposed, based on the modelling of both the slab and the
weak layer as Timoshenko beams; although its complexity prevents us from
solving it analytically, it provides enlightening insights into the mechanical
processes at work at the interface between both layers, from a
strength-of-materials perspective. This analysis is a first step towards a
better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of propagation of cracks in
slab avalanches, and towards more accurate avalanche size and occurrence
predictions.

increased levels of sparsity. The measured channel impulse responses are used
to derive a Third-Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)-style propagation
model, used to calculate the Gini index for the comparison of the channel
sparsity between the measurement and simulation based on the 3GPP model. Our
results show that the mean value of the Gini index in measurement is over twice
the value in simulation, implying that the 3GPP channel model does not capture
the effects of sparsity in the delay domain as frequency increases. In
addition, a new intra-cluster power allocation model based on measurements is
proposed to characterize the effects of sparsity in the delay domain of the

theoretical derivations and simulations. Using the derived intra-cluster power
allocation model, the mean value of the Gini index is 0.97, while the spread of

found that GC MSPs generally rotate slower than their counterparts in the GF.
Different from the expectation of a simple recycling scenario, no evidence for
the correlation between the orbital period and the rotation period can be found
from the MSP binaries in GCs. There is also an indication that the surface
magnetic field of GC MSPs are stronger than those in the GF. All these suggest
dynamical interactions in GCs can alter the evolution of MSPs/their progenitors
which can leave an imprint on their X-ray emission properties. While the MSPs
in both GF and GCs have similar distributions of X-ray luminosity and hardness,
our sample supports the notion that these two populations follow different
relation between the X-ray luminosity and spin-down power. We discuss this in
terms of both pulsar emission model and the observational bias.

in online use of abusive content. Therefore, automatically detecting this

toxicity and violence on social media platforms. The existing works on hate
speech and offensive language detection produce promising results based on
pre-trained transformer models, however, they considered only the analysis of
abusive content features generated through annotated datasets. This paper
addresses a multi-task joint learning approach which combines external
emotional features extracted from another corpora in dealing with the
imbalanced and scarcity of labeled datasets. Our analysis are using two
well-known Transformer-based models, BERT and mBERT, where the later is used to
address abusive content detection in multi-lingual scenarios. Our model jointly
learns abusive content detection with emotional features by sharing
representations through transformers' shared encoder. This approach increases
data efficiency, reduce overfitting via shared representations, and ensure fast
learning by leveraging auxiliary information. Our findings demonstrate that
emotional knowledge helps to more reliably identify hate speech and offensive
language across datasets. Our hate speech detection Multi-task model exhibited
3% performance improvement over baseline models, but the performance of
multi-task models were not significant for offensive language detection task.
More interestingly, in both tasks, multi-task models exhibits less false
positive errors compared to single task scenario.

However, CFD simulation requires meticulous setup by experts and is

  For a $\pi$-formal group scheme $G$, by a previous construction, one attaches
a canonical filtered isocrystal $\mathbf{H}_\delta(G)$ associated to the
arithmetic jet spaces of $G$. In the second half of our paper, we show that
$\mathbf{H}_\delta(A)$ is of finite rank if $A$ is an abelian scheme. As an
application, for an elliptic curve $A$ defined over $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we show
that our canonical filtered isocrystal $\mathbf{H}_\delta(A) \otimes
\mathbb{Q}_p$ is weakly admissible. In particular, if $A$ does not admit a lift
of Frobenius, we show that that $\mathbf{H}_\delta(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ is
canonically isomorphic to the first crystalline cohomology
$\mathbf{H}^1_{\mathrm{cris}}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ in the category of
filtered isocrystals. On the other hand, if $A$ admits a lift of Frobenius,
then $\mathbf{H}_\delta(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ is isomorphic to the
sub-isocrystal $H^0(A,\Omega_A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$ of
$\mathbf{H}^1_{\mathrm{cris}}(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}_p$.
  The above result can be viewed as a character theoretic interpretation of the

interleukin 8 and interleukin 10 are included to assess the relationship
between cytokine release from macrophages and the concentration of the S.

complete systems of immune activation. In the numerical simulations, a low

responds to infections from different pathogens. Furthermore, numerical

chaotic nature of ocean flows and uncertainty of ocean models -- instead of
making use of classical deterministic or stochastic differential equations we
offer a probabilistic evolutionary approach (PEA) that capitalizes on the use
of probabilistic dynamics in phase space. The main feature of the data-driven
version of PEA proposed in this work is that it does not require to know the
physics behind the flow dynamics to model it. Within the PEA framework we
develop two probabilistic evolutionary methods, which are based on
probabilistic evolutionary models using quasi time-invariant structures in
phase space.
  The methods have been tested on complete and incomplete reference data sets
generated by the Lorenz 63 system and by an idealized multi-layer
quasi-geostrophic model. The results show that both methods reproduce large-
and small-scale features of the reference flow by keeping the probabilistic
dynamics within the reference phase space (the phase space of the reference
flow). The proposed approach offers appealing benefits and a great flexibility
to ocean modellers working with mathematical models and measurements. The most
remarkable one is that it provides an alternative to the mainstream ocean
parameterizations, requires no modification of existing ocean models, and easy
to implement. Moreover, it does not depend on the nature of input data, and
therefore can work with both numerically-computed flows and real measurements
from different sources (drifters, weather stations, etc.).

identified during follow-up prior to the onset of significant tumor growth,
enabling personalized follow-up intervals and early selection for salvage
treatment. All experiments are performed on a dataset from clinical routine of

The classification is realized via the maximum-relevance minimal-redundancy
(MRMR) technique and support vector machines (SVM). The pipeline leads to a
classification with a mean area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.83 in internal
cross-validation and allows a division of the cohort into two subcohorts that
differ significantly in their median time to progression (low-risk metastasis

classification performance is especially enhanced by the analysis of medical

virtual particle-antiparticle pairs outside the event horizon of a black hole

infinity contributing to the Hawking flux, while its corresponding antiparticle
partner enters the event horizon and ultimately reaches the singularity. The
aim of this paper is to investigate the energy density correlations between the
Hawking particles and their partners across the event horizon of two models of
non-singular black holes by calculating the two-point correlation function of
the density operator of a massless scalar field. This analysis is motivated by
the fact that in acoustic black holes particle-partner correlations are
signalled by the presence of a peak in the equal time density-density
correlator. Performing the calculation in a Schwarzschild black hole it was
shown in [1] that the peak does not appear, mainly because of the singularity.
It is then interesting to consider what happens when the singularity is not
present. In the Hayward and Simpson-Visser non-singular black holes we show
that the density-density correlator remains finite when the partner particle
approaches the hypersurface that replaces the singularity, opening the
possibility that partner-particle correlations can propagate towards other
regions of spacetime instead of being lost in a singularity.

study the dynamic response of a system to a specific input or stimulus. While
in many applications, a deeper understanding of the input-response behaviour is
highly desirable, it is often hindered by the large number of molecular species
and the complexity of the interactions. An approach that identifies key
molecular species for a given input-response relationship and characterises
dynamic properties of states is therefore highly desirable. We introduce the
concept of index analysis; it is based on different time- and state-dependent
quantities (indices) to identify important dynamic characteristics of molecular
species. All indices are defined for a specific pair of input and response
variables as well as for a specific magnitude of the input. In application to a
large-scale kinetic model of the EGFR signalling cascade, we identified
different phases of signal transduction, the peculiar role of Phosphatase3
during signal activation and Ras recycling during signal onset. In addition, we
discuss the challenges and pitfalls of interpreting the relevance of molecular
species based on knock-out simulation studies, and provide an alternative view
on conflicting results on the importance of parallel EGFR downstream pathways.
We envision that index analysis will be beneficial in comparing different model

agents and draws a lot of attention. However, there is a notable limitation to

natural aspect of high-quality responses. As a result, MRC models trained on
these datasets can not generate human-like responses in real QA scenarios. To
this end, we construct a new dataset called Penguin to promote the research of
MRC, providing a training and test bed for natural response generation to real
scenarios. Concretely, Penguin consists of 200k training data with high-quality
fluent, and well-informed responses. Penguin is the first benchmark towards
natural response generation in Chinese MRC on a relatively large scale. To
address the challenges in Penguin, we develop two strong baselines: end-to-end

fine-tuning the pre-trained generative language models with a mixture of prefix

particular concern for growers, as it causes significant damage to fruit and

of deep learning and hyperspectral imaging to accurately identify an apple
symptom infection in apple trees. In total, 168 image scenes were collected
using conventional RGB and Visible to Near-infrared (VIS-NIR) spectral imaging
(8 channels) in infected orchards. Spectral data were preprocessed with an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained in segmentation to detect scab pixels
based on spectral information. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) was used to
find the most discriminating channels in spectral data based on the healthy
leaf and scab infested leaf spectra. Five combinations of false-colour images
were created from the spectral data and the segmentation net results. The
images were trained and evaluated with a modified version of the YOLOv5
network. Despite the promising results of deep learning using RGB images
(P=0.8, mAP@50=0.73), the detection of apple scab in apple trees using
multispectral imaging proved to be a difficult task. The high-light environment
of the open field made it difficult to collect a balanced spectrum from the
multispectral camera, since the infrared channel and the visible channels
needed to be constantly balanced so that they did not overexpose in the images.

driven by an increase in correlation between absorption and emission processes,
leading to the onset of self-sustained stimulated emission (laser threshold),
followed, in turn, by a correlation decrease and ending with the dominance of
coherent emission. The first-order coherence $g^{(1)}$ steadily increases, as
the pump grows towards the laser threshold value, and reaches unity at or
beyond threshold. The transition toward coherent emission becomes increasingly
sharp as the number of emitters and of the coupled electromagnetic cavity modes
increase, continuously connecting, in the thermodynamic limit, the physics of
nano- and macroscopic lasers at threshold. Our predictions are in remarkable
agreement with experiments whose first-order coherence measurements have so far

transmission in fluid-coupled elastic plates. One is the multiple reflections
approach (analogous to the study of FTIR in electromagnetic/optical waves),
which is shown to have limited applicability for incident angles beyond the
first critical angle. This prompted us to address the problem using the second,
potentials-based approach, which is established and validated against
experimental data with correct predictions for a thin air-coupled steel sheet.
A relation between the transmitted power and the dispersion curves for guided
waves in the plate is established, highlighting the two fundamental causes of
FTIR in such systems. First, a thin plate, when compared to the wavelength of
the wave incident on it, will always be subjected to the effects of FTIR. This
is because the evanescent wave created inside the plate will never assume
negligible values, thus always allowing transmission to the other side. Second,
and more surprisingly, the excitation of the fundamental antisymmetric mode
$A_0$ of the plate is shown to be a direct enabler of FTIR, even for thicker
plates.

asymptotic correlations between the sample mean and sample standard deviation

either parallel or perpendicular to the divergent magnetic field lines and
argues for a coherent curvature radiation mechanism from charge bunches in a
strongly magnetized pair plasma. However, in a subset of pulsars the radio
emission is significantly depolarized and the PPA shows a complex pattern which
cannot be explained using RVM. We propose that even in such cases the highly

two parallel tracks separated by 90\degr. We have investigated PSR

finite-length impulse response filtering (linear convolution) using overlap-add

finite-wordlength implementations, the overall system corresponds to a
time-varying system that can be represented in essentially two different ways.
One way is to represent the system with a distortion function and aliasing
functions, which in this paper is derived from multirate filter bank
representations. The other way is to use a periodically time-varying
impulse-response representation or, equivalently, a set of time-invariant
impulse responses and the corresponding frequency responses. The paper provides
systematic derivations and analyses of these representations along with filter
impulse response properties and design examples. The representations are
particularly useful when analyzing the effect of coefficient quantizations as
well as the use of shorter DFT lengths than theoretically required. A
comprehensive computational-complexity analysis is also provided, and accurate
formulas for estimating the optimal DFT lengths for given filter lengths are
derived. Using optimal DFT lengths, it is shown that the frequency-domain
implementations have lower computational complexities (multiplication rates)
than the corresponding time-domain implementations for filter lengths that are
shorter than those reported earlier in the literature. In particular, for
general (unsymmetric) filters, the frequency-domain implementations are shown
to be more efficient for all filter lengths. This opens up for new
considerations when comparing complexities of different filter implementations.

launching by shearing of foot-points (either slowly - the ``Solar flare''
paradigm, or suddenly - the ``star quake"" paradigm), to propagation in the
preceding magnetar wind. For slow shear, most of the energy injected into the
CME is first spent on the work done on breaking through the over-laying
magnetic field. At later stages, sufficiently powerful CMEs may experience
``detonation"" and lead to opening of the magnetosphere beyond some
equipartition radius $r_{eq}$, where the energy of the CME becomes larger than
the decreasing external magnetospheric energy. Post-CME magnetosphere relaxes
via formation of a plasmoid-mediated current sheet, initially at $\sim r_{eq}$
and slowly reaching the light cylinder (this transient stage has much higher
spindown rate and may produce an ``anti-glitch''). Both the location of the
foot-point shear and the global magnetospheric configuration affect the
frequent-and-weak versus rare-and-powerful CME dichotomy - to produce powerful
flares the slow shear should be limited to field lines that close near the
star. After the creation of a topologically disconnected flux tube, the tube
quickly (at $\sim$ the light cylinder) comes into force-balance with the
preceding wind, and is passively advected/frozen in the wind afterward. For
fast shear (a local rotational glitch), the resulting large amplitude Alfven
waves lead to opening of the magnetosphere (which later recovers similarly to
the slow shear case). At distances much larger than the light cylinder, the
resulting shear Alfven waves propagate through the wind non-dissipatively.
Implications to Fast Radio Bursts are discussed.

We focus on the evolution across cosmic time of the halo shapes and the

findings show that haloes tend to be more triaxial at earlier times as a
consequence of stronger accretion in the direction of the filaments. As the
haloes evolve towards a dominant isotropic accretion mode and relaxation, their
shape at 20 percent of the virial mass becomes more spherical. In agreement
with previous results, baryons have an important effect within the inner
regions of the haloes, driving them from triaxial to rounder shapes. We also
find a correlation between the strength of the quadrupole infalling mode and
the degree of ellipticity of the haloes: as the filament strength decreases

studied and understood since the 1960's, and this area of research remains
active until nowadays.
  As it turns out, the periodic temporal graph realization problem has a very
different computational complexity behavior than its static (i.e. non-temporal)
counterpart. First we show that the problem is NP-hard in general, but
polynomial-time solvable if the so-called underlying graph is a tree or a
cycle. Building upon those results, we investigate its parameterized
computational complexity with respect to structural parameters of the
underlying static graph which measure the ``tree-likeness''. For those
parameters, we essentially give a tight classification between parameters that
allow for tractability (in the FPT sense) and parameters that presumably do
not. We show that our problem is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the
\emph{feedback vertex number} of the underlying graph, while we show that it is
in FPT when parameterized by the \emph{feedback edge number} of the underlying

reducing the acquisition time of relatively slow modalities such as magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Popular methods are based mostly on compressed sensing
(CS), which relies on the random sampling of Fourier coefficients ($k$-space)
to produce incoherent (noise-like) artefacts that can be removed via convex
optimisation. Hardware constraints currently limit Cartesian CS to one
dimensional (1D) phase-encode undersampling schemes, leading to coherent and
structured artefacts. Reconstruction algorithms typically deploy an idealised
and limited 2D regularisation for artefact removal, which increases the
difficulty of image recovery. Recognising that phase-encode artefacts can be
separated into contiguous 1D signals, we develop two decoupling techniques that
enable explicit 1D regularisation. We thereby leverage the excellent
incoherence characteristics in the phase-encode direction. We also derive a
combined 1D + 2D reconstruction technique that further takes advantage of
spatial relationships within the image, leading to an improvement of existing
2D deep-learned (DL) recovery techniques. Performance is evaluated on a brain

was investigated using two spectrophotometric surveys, the Eight Color Asteroid
Survey (ECAS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which cover wavelengths
down to 0.32 um and 0.36 um, respectively. We classified asteroids from the
main asteroid belt, the Cybele and Hilda zones, and Jupiter Trojans based on
Tholen's taxonomy and described the statistical distribution of primitive
asteroid types. We also examined the relationship of the NUV, 0.7 um, and 2.7
um absorptions among primitive asteroids and hydrous carbonaceous chondrites CI

(2.7 um) absorptions for primitive asteroids and hydrated meteorites,
suggesting the NUV absorption can be indicative of hydrated silicates.
Moreover, there is a great difference in the NUV absorption between the large
asteroids (diameter d > 50 km) and small asteroids (d < 10 km) in the taxonomic
distribution. The taxonomic distribution of asteroids differs between the inner
main belt and middle-outer main belt. Notably, the C types are dominating large
members through the main belt and the F types are dominating small asteroids of
the inner main belt. The asteroids beyond the main belt consist mostly of P and
D types, although P types are common everywhere in the main belt. The peculiar

phenomena since division by small numbers is absent in the Richardson approach.
In addition, two preconditioners are considered and compared in the Richardson

Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes
that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and
variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and
optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In
this paper, we discuss two points: firstly, the convergence difficulties
reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by following the
recommendation from the original authors that a warm-up period should be used.
During this period, only the mean is optimized assuming a fixed variance. This
recommendation is often not used in practice. We experimentally demonstrate how
essential this step is. We also examine if keeping the mean estimate fixed
after the warm-up leads to different results than estimating both the mean and
the variance simultaneously after the warm-up. We do not observe a substantial
difference. Secondly, we propose a novel improvement of the MVE network:
separate regularization of the mean and the variance estimate. We demonstrate,
both on toy examples and on a number of benchmark UCI regression data sets,
that following the original recommendations and the novel separate
regularization can lead to significant improvements.

complexity is network pruning, where less important parameters are deleted. The
work presented in this paper investigates whether this technical complexity
reduction also helps with perceived explainability. To do so, we conducted a
pre-study and two human-grounded experiments, assessing the effects of
different pruning ratios on CNN explainability. Overall, we evaluated four
different compression rates (i.e., CPR 2, 4, 8, and 32) with 37 500 tasks on
Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that lower compression rates have a positive
influence on explainability, while higher compression rates show negative
effects. Furthermore, we were able to identify sweet spots that increase both
the perceived explainability and the model's performance.

  simplices",,,,,"math.FA cs.IT math.CO math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An equiangular tight frame (ETF) is a finite sequence of equal norm vectors
in a Hilbert space of lesser dimension that achieves equality in the Welch
bound and so has minimal coherence. The binder of an ETF is the set of all
subsets of its indices whose corresponding vectors form a regular simplex. An
ETF achieves equality in Donoho and Elad's spark bound if and only if its
binder is nonempty. When this occurs, its binder is the set of all linearly
dependent subsets of it of minimal size. Moreover, if members of the binder
form a balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) then its incidence matrix can be
phased to produce a sparse representation of its dual (Naimark complement). A
few infinite families of ETFs are known to have this remarkable property. In
this paper, we relate this property to the recently introduced concept of a
doubly transitive equiangular tight frame (DTETF), namely an ETF for which the
natural action of its symmetry group is doubly transitive. In particular, we
show that the binder of any DTETF is either empty or forms a BIBD, and moreover
that when the latter occurs, any member of the binder of its dual is an oval of
this BIBD. We then apply this general theory to certain known infinite families
of DTETFs. Specifically, any symplectic form on a finite vector space yields a
DTETF, and we compute the binder of it and its dual, showing that the former is
empty except in a single notable case, and that the latter consists of affine
Lagrangian subspaces; this unifies and generalizes several results from the
existing literature. We then consider the binders of four infinite families of
DTETFs that arise from quadratic forms over the field of two elements, showing
that two of these are empty except in a finite number of cases, whereas the
other two form BIBDs that relate to each other, and to Lagrangian subspaces, in
nonobvious ways.

be distinguished perfectly. This property ensures the security of quantum key

design and implement strategies to optimally distinguish quantum states. In
general, when distinguishing multiple copies of quantum states the optimal
measurement will be an entangling collective measurement. However, to date,
collective measurements have not been used to enhance quantum state
discrimination. One of the main reasons for this is the fact that, in the usual

required to be measured collectively to outperform separable measurements. This
is very challenging experimentally. In this work, we propose and experimentally
demonstrate a protocol for distinguishing two copies of single qubit states

proving Bayes optimality of the posterior predictive of pseudo-samples. We
further overcome computational hurdles by approximating the criterion
analytically. Its relation to the marginal likelihood allows us to come up with
an approximation based on Laplace's method and the Gaussian integral. We

the stability number $\alpha(G)$, well-known to be polynomial-time computable.
When the size is the product $|A|\cdot |B|$ one finds the parameter $g(G)$,

These hardness results motivate introducing semidefinite programming bounds for

closed-form eigenvalue bounds, which coincide with the semidefinite bounds for

static pool-based and stream-based active learning. Pool-based active learning

with respect to a given target, and the minimization of an integral functional
(while the trajectories reach this target). Here we consider a problem where
stabilizability or controllability are investigated together with the further
aim of a ""cost regulation"", namely a state-dependent upper bounding of the
functional. This paper is devoted to a crucial step in the program of
establishing a chain of equivalences among degree-k stabilizability with
regulated cost, asymptotic controllability with regulated cost, and the
existence of a degree-k Minimum Restraint Function (which is a special kind of
Control Lyapunov Function). Besides the presence of a cost we allow the
stabilizing ""feedback"" to give rise to directions that range in the union of
original directions and the family of iterated Lie bracket of length less or
equal to $k$. In the main result asymptotic controllability [resp. with
regulated cost] is proved to be necessary for degree-k stabilizability [resp.
with regulated cost]. Further steps of the above-mentioned logical chain are
proved in companion papers, so that also a Lyapunov-type inverse theorem --
i.e. the possibility of deriving existence of a Minimum Restraint Function from
stabilizability -- appears as quite likely.

implicit distribution alignment networks (DIDAN) to deal with cross-corpus

(source) and unlabeled testing (target) speech signals come from different
corpora. Specifically, DIDAN first adopts a simple deep regression network
consisting of a set of convolutional and fully connected layers to directly
regress the source speech spectrums into the emotional labels such that the
proposed DIDAN can own the emotion discriminative ability. Then, such ability
is transferred to be also applicable to the target speech samples regardless of
corpus variance by resorting to a well-designed regularization term called
implicit distribution alignment (IDA). Unlike widely-used maximum mean
discrepancy (MMD) and its variants, the proposed IDA absorbs the idea of sample
reconstruction to implicitly align the distribution gap, which enables DIDAN to
learn both emotion discriminative and corpus invariant features from speech
spectrums. To evaluate the proposed DIDAN, extensive cross-corpus SER
experiments on widely-used speech emotion corpora are carried out. Experimental
results show that the proposed DIDAN can outperform lots of recent
state-of-the-art methods in coping with the cross-corpus SER tasks.

text. Still, HE is not widespread due to limitations in terms of efficiency and
usability. Among the challenges of HE, scheme parametrization (i.e., the
selection of appropriate parameters within the algorithms) is a relevant
multi-faced problem. First, the parametrization needs to comply with a set of
properties to guarantee the security of the underlying scheme. Second,
parametrization requires a deep understanding of the low-level primitives since
the parameters have a confronting impact on the precision, performance, and
security of the scheme. Finally, the circuit to be executed influences, and it
is influenced by, the parametrization. Thus, there is no general optimal
selection of parameters, and this selection depends on the circuit and the
scenario of the application. Currently, most of the existing HE frameworks
require cryptographers to address these considerations manually. It requires a
minimum of expertise acquired through a steep learning curve. In this paper, we
propose a unified solution for the aforementioned challenges. Concretely, we
present an expert system combining Fuzzy Logic and Linear Programming. The
Fuzzy Logic Modules receive a user selection of high-level priorities for the
security, efficiency, and performance of the cryptosystem. Based on these
preferences, the expert system generates a Linear Programming Model that
obtains optimal combinations of parameters by considering those priorities
while preserving a minimum level of security for the cryptosystem. We conduct
an extended evaluation where we show that an expert system generates optimal
parameter selections that maintain user preferences without undergoing the

the small-scale enhancement of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations.
In this paper, we specifically focus on non-canonical warm inflationary
scenarios and study a model of warm Higgs-G inflation, in which the Standard
Model Higgs boson drives inflation, with a Galileon-like non-linear kinetic
term. We show that in the Galileon-dominated regime, the primordial power
spectrum is strongly enhanced, leading to the formation of primordial black
holes (PBH) with a wide range of the mass spectrum. Interestingly, PBHs in the
asteroid mass window $\sim (10^{17}$ -- $10^{23}$) g are generated in this
model, which can explain the total abundance of the dark matter in the
Universe. In our analysis, we also calculate the secondary gravitational waves
(GW) sourced by these small-scale overdense fluctuations and find that the
induced GW spectrum can be detected in the future GW detectors, such as LISA,
BBO, DECIGO, etc. Our scenario thus provides a novel way of generating PBHs as
dark matter and a detectable stochastic GW background from warm inflation. We
also show that our scenario is consistent with the swampland and the
trans-Planckian censorship conjectures and, thus, remains in the viable
landscape of UV complete theories.

scalar fields in the gravitational sector. The particularity of this work is
that we allow for direct couplings between these gravitating scalars and the
matter sector, in addition to the universal interactions generated by the
Jordan frame metric. The weak gravity regime of this theory, which would
describe solar-system experiments, is studied using the parametrized
post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. We derive the expression of the ten parameters
of this formalism. They are modified with respect to their values in the
theories without direct couplings. We then show that in order to bring the PPN
parameters to their general relativity values, relatively large direct
couplings are needed, contrary to the claims in the recent literature. Such
large couplings, when they exist, make the motion of non-relativistic probes to
deviate from geodesics of the PPN metric already at Newtonian order. They would
thus be directly detectable and would have been ruled out by experiments. This
shows that it is impossible to screen the presence of gravitating scalars
relying only on a curved target space and direct couplings to matter.

the capacity of constituting entities to perform directed motion, e.g.,
molecular motors transporting vesicles inside cells or bacteria searching for

synthetic systems, such as transporting a cargo to a targeted zone, theoretical
studies have primarily focused on single active particles subject to various
spatial and temporal stimuli. Here we study the behavior of a self-propelled
particle carrying a passive cargo in a travelling activity wave and show that
this active-passive dimer displays a rich, emergent tactic behavior. For
cargoes with low mobility, the dimer always drifts in the direction of the wave
propagation. For highly-mobile cargoes, instead, the dimer can also drift
against the traveling wave. The transition between these two tactic behaviors
is controlled by the ratio between the frictions of the cargo and the
microswimmer. In slow activity waves the dimer can perform an active surfing of
the wave maxima, with an average drift velocity equal to the wave speed. These
analytical predictions, which we confirm by numerical simulations, might be
useful for the future efficient design of bio-hybrid microswimmers.

improvements on many downstream medical tasks owing to its applicability to
extracting generic representations from medical images and texts. Practically,
there exist two typical types, \textit{i.e.}, the fusion-encoder type and the
dual-encoder type, depending on whether a heavy fusion module is used. The
former is superior at multi-modal tasks owing to the sufficient interaction
between modalities; the latter is good at uni-modal and cross-modal tasks due
to the single-modality encoding ability. To take advantage of these two types,
we propose an effective yet straightforward scheme named PTUnifier to unify the
two types. We first unify the input format by introducing visual and textual
prompts, which serve as a feature bank that stores the most representative
images/texts. By doing so, a single model could serve as a \textit{foundation
model} that processes various tasks adopting different input formats
(\textit{i.e.}, image-only, text-only, and image-text-pair). Furthermore, we
construct a prompt pool (instead of static ones) to improve diversity and
scalability. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results on a broad range of tasks, spanning uni-modal tasks
(\textit{i.e.}, image/text classification and text summarization), cross-modal
tasks (\textit{i.e.}, image-to-text generation and image-text/text-image
retrieval), and multi-modal tasks (\textit{i.e.}, visual question answering),
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Note that the adoption of
prompts is orthogonal to most existing Med-VLP approaches and could be a

explore the early JWST view on massive group formation in the distant Universe.
The group contains >16 members (including 6 spectros. confirmations) down to
log10(Mstar/Msun)=8.5, including the brightest group galaxy (BGG) in the
process of actively assembling at this redshift. The BGG is comprised of
multiple merging components extending ~3.6"" (30kpc) across the sky. The BGG
contributes 69% of the group's total galactic stellar mass, with one of the
merging components containing 76% of the total mass of the BGG and a
SFR>1810Msun/yr. Most importantly, we detect intra-halo light (IHL) in several
HST and JWST/NIRCam bands, allowing us to construct a state-of-the-art
rest-frame UV-NIR Spectral Energy Distribution of the IHL for the first time at
this high redshift. This allows stellar population characterisation of both the
IHL and member galaxies, as well as the morphology distribution of group
galaxies vs. their star-formation activity when coupled with Herschel data. We
create a stacked image of the IHL, giving us a sensitivity to extended emission
of 28.5 mag/arcsec2 at rest-frame 1um. We find that the IHL is extremely dust
poor (Av~0), containing an evolved stellar population of log10(t50/yr)=8.8,
corresponding to a formation epoch for 50% of the stellar material 0.63Gyr
before z=1.85. There is no evidence of ongoing star-formation in the IHL. The
IHL in this group at z=1.85 contributes ~10% of the total stellar mass,
comparable with what is observed in local clusters. This suggests that the
evolution of the IHL fraction is more self-similar with redshift than predicted
by some models, challenging our understanding of IHL formation during the
assembly of high-redshift clusters. JWST is unveiling a new side of group
formation at this redshift, which will evolve into Virgo-like structures in the
local Universe.

between 2280 and 3070{\AA}. We correct for systematic effects in the raw data
using the jitter engineering parameters and polynomial modelling to fit the
white light curves of the two transits. We observe an increase in the
planet-to-star radius ratio at short wavelengths, but no spectrally resolved
absorption lines. The difference between the radius ratios at 2400 and
3000{\AA} reaches $0.0191\pm0.0042$ ($\sim$4.5$-\sigma$). Although the NUV
transmission spectrum does not show evidence of hydrodynamical escape, the
strong atmospheric features are likely due to species at very high altitudes.
We performed a 1D simulation of the temperature and composition of WASP-79b
using Exo-REM. The temperature pressure profile crosses condensation curves of
radiatively active clouds, particularly MnS, Mg$_2$SiO$_4$, Fe, and
Al$_2$O$_3$. Still, none of these species produces the level of observed
absorption at short wavelengths and can explain the observed increase in the
planet's radius. WASP-79b's transit depth reaches 23 scale height, making it
one of the largest spectral features observed in an exoplanet at this
temperature ($\sim$1700 K). The comparison of WASP-79b's transmission spectrum
with three warmer hot Jupiters shows a similar level of absorption to WASP-178b

contribution from higher angular modes. We then discuss how this will be
modified when taking into account dissipation effects near the horizon due to
interaction with the quantum black hole microstates. The structure of
quasi-normal modes drastically changes, yielding a fundamental frequency of the
inverse of $t_{\rm echo} \sim$ log(Entropy)/Temperature. This is the time-scale
for reflection from the microstates (or the quantum time limit of silence,
followed by echoes), $\textit{independent of the strength of dissipation}$, and
is comparable to the scrambling time proposed by Sekino & Susskind. Setting the

can best be realized. One promising approach is to make use of landscape
features to enable a per-run trajectory-based switch. Here, the samples seen by
the first algorithm are used to create a set of features which describe the
landscape from the perspective of the algorithm. These features are then used
to predict what algorithm to switch to.
  In this work, we extend this per-run trajectory-based approach to consider a
wide variety of potential points at which to perform the switch. We show that
using a sliding window to capture the local landscape features contains
information which can be used to predict whether a switch at that point would
be beneficial to future performance. By analyzing the resulting models, we
identify what features are most important to these predictions. Finally, by
evaluating the importance of features and comparing these values between
multiple algorithms, we show clear differences in the way the second algorithm

empirical exploration of prompting within the community, relatively few works
have studied prompting at a mathematical level. In this work we aim to take a
first step towards understanding basic geometric properties induced by prompts
in Stable Diffusion, focusing on the intrinsic dimension of internal

substantial impact on the intrinsic dimension of representations at both layers
of the model which we explored, but that the nature of this impact depends on
the layer being considered. For example, in certain bottleneck layers of the
model, intrinsic dimension of representations is correlated with prompt
perplexity (measured using a surrogate model), while this correlation is not
apparent in the latent layers. Our evidence suggests that intrinsic dimension
could be a useful tool for future studies of the impact of different prompts on

the resulting model predictions agree with the reported summary statistics. In
doing so, the reported uncertainties are effectively reflected in the inferred

  (TIP-GAN)",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a new Tipping Point Generative Adversarial Network (TIP-GAN) for
better characterizing potential climate tipping points in Earth system models.
We describe an adversarial game to explore the parameter space of these models,
detect upcoming tipping points, and discover the drivers of tipping points. In
this setup, a set of generators learn to construct model configurations that
will invoke a climate tipping point. The discriminator learns to identify which
generators are generating each model configuration and whether a given
configuration will lead to a tipping point. The discriminator is trained using
an oracle (a surrogate climate model) to test if a generated model
configuration leads to a tipping point or not. We demonstrate the application
of this GAN to invoke the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation (AMOC). We share experimental results of modifying the loss
functions and the number of generators to exploit the area of uncertainty in
model state space near a climate tipping point. In addition, we show that our
trained discriminator can predict AMOC collapse with a high degree of accuracy
without the use of the oracle. This approach could generalize to other tipping
points, and could augment climate modeling research by directing users
interested in studying tipping points to parameter sets likely to induce said
tipping points in their computationally intensive climate models.

  Post-Disturbance Stability Guarantees",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SP eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Disturbances may create cascading failures in power systems and lead to
widespread blackouts. Controlled islanding is an effective approach to mitigate
cascading failures by partitioning the power system into a set of disjoint
islands. To retain the stability of the power system following disturbances,
the islanding strategy should not only be minimally disruptive, but also
guarantee post-disturbance stability. In this paper, we study the problem of
synthesizing post-disturbance stability-aware controlled islanding strategies.
To ensure post-disturbance stability, our computation of islanding strategies
takes load-generation balance and transmission line capacity constraints into
consideration, leading to a hybrid optimization problem with both discrete and
continuous variables. To mitigate the computational challenge incurred when
solving the hybrid optimization program, we propose the concepts of hybrid
submodularity and hybrid matroid. We show that the islanding problem is
equivalent to a hybrid matroid optimization program, whose objective function
is hybrid supermodular. Leveraging the supermodularity property, we develop an
efficient local search algorithm and show that the proposed algorithm achieves
1/2-optimality guarantee. We compare our approach with a baseline using
mixed-integer linear program on IEEE 118-bus, IEEE 300-bus, ActivSg 500-bus,
and Polish 2383-bus systems. Our results show that our approach outperforms the
baseline in terms of the total cost incurred during islanding across all test
cases. Furthermore, our proposed approach can find an islanding strategy for
large-scale test cases such as Polish 2383-bus system, whereas the baseline
approach becomes intractable.

the partial data from cluster heads to credible associates through
device-to-device (D2D) communication. Moreover, aiming at diluting the data
skew on nodes, we formulate the joint clustering and data sharing problem based
on the privacy-preserving constrained graph. To tackle the serious coupling of
decisions on the graph, we devise a distribution-based adaptive clustering

ensures the maximum yield of data sharing. The experiments show that the

in multi-variate time series data, which are of major significance for today's
industrial applications. However, establishing an anomaly detection system that
can be rapidly and accurately located is a challenging problem due to the lack
of outlier tags, the high dimensional complexity of the data, memory
bottlenecks in the actual hardware, and the need for fast reasoning. We have
proposed an anomaly detection and diagnosis model--DTAAD in this paper, based
on Transformer and Dual TCN. Our overall model will be an integrated design in
which AR combines AE structures, introducing scaling methods and feedback
mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy and expand correlation differences.
The Dual TCN-Attention Network(DTA) constructed by us only uses a single layer
of Transformer encoder in our baseline experiment, which belongs to an
ultra-lightweight model. Our extensive experiments on six publicly datasets
validate that DTAAD exceeds current most advanced baseline methods in both
detection and diagnostic performance. Specifically, DTAAD improved F1 scores by
$8.38\%$, and reduced training time by $99\%$ compared to baseline. The code

heterogeneous nature of the learning environment greatly limits its performance

which often result in an unstable training process and degraded accuracy.
Herein, we propose strategies to address these challenges. Targeting the
heterogeneous data distribution, we propose a novel adaptive mixing aggregation
(AMA) scheme that mixes the model updates from previous rounds with current
rounds to avoid large model shifts and thus, maintain training stability. We
further propose a novel staleness-based weighting scheme for the asynchronous
model updates caused by the dynamic wireless environment. Lastly, we propose a
novel CPU-friendly computation-reduction scheme based on transfer learning by
sharing the feature extractor (FES) and letting the computing-limited devices
update only the classifier. The simulation results show that the proposed
framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art solutions and increases the
test accuracy, and training stability by up to 2.38%, 93.10% respectively.
Additionally, the proposed framework can tolerate communication delay of up to

correctly capture the positive yet non-monotonous correlation between them. We
further demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of model transfer across

community given the recent trend of ever larger and more complex neural network
models. Existing solutions for reducing the computational load of training at
inference time usually involve pruning the network parameters. Pruning schemes
often create extra overhead either by iterative training and fine-tuning for
static pruning or repeated computation of a dynamic pruning graph. We propose a
new parameter pruning strategy for learning a lighter-weight sub-network that
minimizes the energy cost while maintaining comparable performance to the fully
parameterised network on given downstream tasks. Our proposed pruning scheme is
green-oriented, as it only requires a one-off training to discover the optimal
static sub-networks by dynamic pruning methods. The pruning scheme consists of
a binary gating module and a novel loss function to uncover sub-networks with
user-defined sparsity. Our method enables pruning and training simultaneously,
which saves energy in both the training and inference phases and avoids extra
computational overhead from gating modules at inference time. Our results on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 suggest that our scheme can remove 50% of connections in
deep networks with 1% reduction in classification accuracy. Compared to other
related pruning methods, our method demonstrates a lower drop in accuracy for

  reconstruction from extremely small data sets",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Microstructure reconstruction is an important and emerging field of research
and an essential foundation to improving inverse computational materials
engineering (ICME). Much of the recent progress in the field is made based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs). Although excellent results have been
achieved throughout a variety of materials, challenges remain regarding the
interpretability of the model's latent space as well as the applicability to
extremely small data sets. The present work addresses these issues by
introducing DA-VEGAN, a model with two central innovations. First, a
$\beta$-variational autoencoder is incorporated into a hybrid GAN architecture
that allows to penalize strong nonlinearities in the latent space by an
additional parameter, $\beta$. Secondly, a custom differentiable data
augmentation scheme is developed specifically for this architecture. The
differentiability allows the model to learn from extremely small data sets
without mode collapse or deteriorated sample quality. An extensive validation
on a variety of structures demonstrates the potential of the method and future
directions of investigation are discussed.

these interfaces has not taken exclusively beneficial paths for humanity From
the beginning of the 21st century onwards an increase in interface design
patterns was observed that instead of facilitating navigation harmed users or
restricted their decisionmaking capabilities earning them the name of Dark
Patterns In view of this the present work aims to address whether Dark Patterns
are legal or illegal in the face of Brazilian data protection and consumer law
verifying in the absence of specific norms on Dark Patterns the best way to
regulate them The research method employed is qualitative analyzing research
court cases norms and national and foreign documents on Dark Patterns After
addressing its effects its legal development and establishing a definition
compatible with Brazilian law it was concluded that although some
implementations are capable of producing damage and violating rights in some
cases the mere declaration of the illegality of these techniques is an
insufficient solution requiring further investigations regarding the hypotheses
in which their negative impacts are less apparent or when they are used for
beneficial purposes among other unsolved problems Therefore it is suggested
that the regulation of Dark Patterns should occur through a system composed of
formal laws and regulations of public administration bodies through a
multidisciplinary approach that is adaptable to new findings and technologies

having a rather radically 'different' tax system to adopting flat-rate taxation
with marginal tax rates that fell from figures as high as 40% to 10% for both
the corporate-income tax and the personal-income tax. Crucially, the
econometric forecasting models in use at the Bulgarian Ministry of Finance
hinted at an increase in tax revenue compatible with the so-called 'Laffer
curve'. Similarly, many economists held the view that revenues would have
increased. However, reality fell short of those expectations based on
forecasting models and rooted in mainstream economic theory. Thus, this paper
asks whether there are betterperforming forecasting models for personal-and
corporate-income tax-revenues in Bulgaria that are readily implementable and
overperform the ones currently in use. After articulating a constructive
critique of the current forecasting models, the paper offers readily
implementable, transparent alternatives and proves their superiority.

Accurately classifying papers is a first step in the direction of personalized

Functional Theory (DFT) in particular is a good example of a methodology used
in very different studies, and interconnected disciplines, which has a very
strong community publishing many research articles. We devise a new
unsupervised method for classifying publications, based on topic modeling, and
use a DFT-related selection of documents as a use case. We first create topics
from word analysis and clustering of the abstracts from the publications, then
attribute each publication/paper to a topic based on word similarity. We then
make interesting observations by analyzing connections between the topics and
publishers, journals, country or year of publication. The proposed approach is
general, and can be applied to analyze publication and citation trends in other
areas of study, beyond the field of Density Function Theory.

achieving this goal is combining photonic-integrated optical frequency combs
with fast photodiodes for difference frequency generation in the THz. Here, we
demonstrate wireless communications using a 300 GHz carrier wave generated via
photomixing of two optical tones originating from diode lasers that are
injection locked to a dissipative Kerr soliton frequency microcomb. We achieve
transfer rates of 80 Gbps using homodyne detection and 60 Gbps transmitting
simultaneously both data and clock signals in a dual-path wireless link. This

Reactor (CVSR) in the Gyrator-Capacitor (G-C) framework. CVSR is a device
capable of controlling the reactance in an ac circuit using the nonlinear
characteristic of ferromagnetic core. Bias magnetic flux produced by a dc
winding can be used to regulate the equivalent ac reactance for various
applications, such as power flow control, oscillation damping, or fault current
limiting. A novel variant of CVSR that features gapless ferromagnetic core and
a split two-coil ac winding is considered. Its nominal reactance is entirely
determined by leakage fluxes. The Gyrator-Capacitor (G-C) approach is used to
model the interface between the magnetic, electronic, and electric circuits, to
maintain consistency of active and reactive powers in these circuits and allow
additional flexibility. For accurate representation of the gapless CVSR, in
addition to a realistic nonlinear and lossy core, elaborate models of different
flux leakages are given. Results from analyses for a range of distances between
the coils of the ac winding at different bias currents are presented.
